Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne believe's he has 'definitely' got the quality to play for England.

The 23-year-old has been ever-present in Saints' charge to second place in the Barclays Premier League, making the right back shirt his own following Calum Chambers' move to Arsenal.

He was rewarded with a first international call-up for last month's Euro 2016 double header against San Marino and Estonia but was an unused substitute in both games.

Nathaniel Clyne beats Mohamed Diame for pace before whipping in a cross against Hull on Saturday

'It's always good to play for your country. If you play well then you get picked up,' he said.

'I think I've got the ability to play for my country, definitely. I'm playing with lots of confidence. 

'Hopefully I can get called up again and receive my first cap.' 

Southampton needed a mis-hit clearance from Hull's third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic and wonderful 40-yard strike from Victor Wanyama to see off Hull on Saturday, but their winning habit is becoming unshakeable.

When previous boss Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham in the summer and the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren followed him out of the door, a season of struggle was widely predicted.

Yet they have now won 10 of their last 11 matches in all competitions, with the meanest defence in the top flight and only Chelsea above them.

Unsurprisingly, spirits are high.

'We keep winning and getting clean sheets, hopefully we can keep up our run of form and see where we go with it,' said Clyne.

'A few of the lads are talking about the Europa League, Europe and stuff. But we've just got to keep pushing and hopefully the results will take care of themselves.'

Hull, meanwhile, were unable to build on battling draws at Arsenal and Liverpool in their previous two matches.

The young full-back has been one of Southampton's most impressive performers this season

Despite the slender scoreline, Southampton were clearly the better side and could have added as many as three to their tally with better finishing.

Nevertheless, they would be forgiven for wondering what might have been had Jakupovic, starting in the Premier League for only the third time with Allan McGregor and Steve Harper injured, not erred.

He sent the ball straight to Wanyama when attempting to clear, leaving himself badly out of position as the ball sailed back into his net.

But midfielder Stephen Quinn insists the Swiss must put the incident behind him as soon as possible.

Clyne was called up to train with the national squad but didn't make an actual appearance 

'It's been difficult for Eldin, he's been a long time out as second or third choice keeper and he came in and did ever so well at Liverpool last week,' said Quinn.

'He's a good keeper, but he made a simple mistake and a lot of the time you can get away with those.

'I'm sure he will be dejected but he's got to be a man about it and get his head up because it looks like he'll be starting again next week.

'You can't dwell on it. He has to look to the next game and try to improve.'
