An anti-crime group is offering a $10,000 reward for two suspects wanted for shooting dead a lawyer as he finished his holiday shopping with his wife at a New Jersey mall on Sunday.

The Essex County Sheriff's Crime Stoppers program announced the reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspects, whom police described as armed and dangerous.

It comes two days after Dustin Friedland was gunned down after letting his wife Jamie into their $80,000 Range Rover before being accosted by carjackers at Short Hills Mall.

Fearful for his wife's safety, he resisted and four shots were fired - including one fatal shot.

Torn apart: Dustin Friedland, 30, was returning with his wife Jamie to their Range Rover after a Sunday night shopping spree when he was fatally shot

Friedman's silver Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack on December 15

One of the attackers then entered the vehicle and ordered Friedland's wife out of the car at gunpoint. The
 two assailants then fled in the 2012 
silver Range Rover.

It was followed by a speeding green Subaru that 
authorities said may have been the vehicle that brought the robbers 
there.

The silver Range Rover was recovered in the southern part of 
Newark on Monday morning and authorities
 are still looking for the two suspects.

Jamie Friedland's boss said the 
only reason Dustin Friedland would ever become involved in an 
altercation would be to protect his wife.

'Dustin was rational, intelligent and had great judgment,' Adam Leitman Bailey told the New York Daily News. 'I highly doubt that he fought the attackers to save his car. I do believe he would fight for his wife’s life.'

The family of the couple have said Dustin Friedland would have readily handed over 
his car keys to avoid a confrontation.

Terror: One of the attackers entered the vehicle and ordered Friedland's wife out of the car at gunpoint

Jamie Friedland's uncle Mark Schare called for the death penalty for Friedland's killers on Monday, saying the pair 'don't deserve to breathe.'

He said that whatever happens to bring the killers to justice, it won't bring back his nephew.

'It helps bring a conclusion but it's not going to take away the void,' he said. 'I hope they catch him and kill him. I'm not a violent person but this criminal doesn't deserve to breathe.'

Schare said he last saw Dustin Friedland at Thanksgiving when he and his wife seemed 'in good spirits.'

'They
 were starting a life together and they had a bright future. He loved my
 niece and took good care of her and was a very attentive and very good 
guy.

'Everybody liked him. I never heard a nasty thing come out of his mouth.'

Manhunt: Two of the suspects fled in the 2012 silver Range Rover owned by the victom. Two others followed in a speeding green Subaru that has now been identified as registered to the mother of Basim Henry

Despite earning his law degree and 
practicing, Schare said Friedland had selflessly decided to partner with
 his father's business.

'He studied as a lawyer but he wanted to help his father and work with him. That's him,' he said. 'That's the person he was.'

According to his LinkedIn profile, 
Friedland was a project manager who analyzed legal claims at a Neptune, 
New Jersey, contracting firm, Epic Mechanical, which is owned by his 
father, Wayne.

Records show the Range Rover was registered to the company.

Friedland and his wife had met while both law students at Syracuse University and married in October 2011.

Tragedy: Friedland and his wife Jamie, who married in 2011, had been looking forward to starting a family together in the near future

The couple were described as madly in love and planning to have their first child, the wife's boss, Adam Leitman Bailey told The Daily News.

'She would just lighten up when he would walk in the room. She was so happy to be married,' said Bailey.

The thugs who shot and killed 
Friedland may be part of a stolen-car ring that’s targeted the tri-state
 area in recent months, according to law-enforcement officials.

An disclosed source told the New York Post
 that they weren’t surprised that the car had been ditched. He added 
that it was ‘rare for a carjacking to end with shots fired and killing 
someone. This is a violent crew.’

The shooting occurred at about 9:10 
p.m. and the New Jersey man was pronounced dead at 11:45 p.m. His wife 
was unharmed, although she was taken to a hospital for evaluation.

The
 posh shopping mall includes 160 stores and restaurants and is anchored 
by Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Macy's and 
Bloomingdale's.

Other tenants include Cartier, Chanel, Tiffany & Co,
 and Gucci. It was open for extended holiday shopping hours on Sunday.

Panicked authorities briefly placed the 
mall on lockdown, which lasted for 30 minutes. Some shoppers could even 
hear the terrifying ordeal as it occurred on the garage’s third floor 
near Nordstrom.

Witness Robert Newman, 55, told the Star-Ledger he heard two gunshots at about 8:30 pm, and then saw a vehicle - though not the victim’s Range Rover - speed away.

‘The
 Subaru went out of here at about 100 miles per hour,’ said Newman, who 
described the vehicle as green. It was unclear if the Subaru he saw was 
connected to the crime.

Another man who was in the mall and working in one of its restaurants said he heard multiple shots as well.

‘The table in the back stood up really fast,’ the restaurant worker told CBS New York.
 ‘They started panicking. I peeked my head out of this door right here, 
and I heard a lady screaming on the top of her lungs, screaming some 
name.’

Millburn Mayor Sandra Haimoff said the shooting was of grave concern, reports NJ.com.

'Our
 police department is out there and I’m sure they’re doing everything 
that needs to be done. But it is upsetting and it’s unfortunate that 
this happened,' she said.

Anyone with information regarding the shooting or the whereabouts of the suspects is urged to call the tips line at (877) 847-7432.
