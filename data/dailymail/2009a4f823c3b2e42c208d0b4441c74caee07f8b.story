Sweden's king and queen have traveled to New York City to meet the newest addition to the royal family: a baby girl born to the royal couple's daughter Princess Madeline on Thursday.

King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia met their new granddaughter for the first time on Saturday after the princess brought the healthy baby girl home from the hospital. The king and queen then headed to Bloomingdale's and Gracious Home for some shopping.

On Sunday, the royal couple met their son-in-law, American banker Christopher O'Neil, at Amaranth, a swanky restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side, for lunch.

Last week, Sweden honored the birth of the new addition to the monarchy with a 21-gun salute in Stockholm.

The king and queen also issued a statement congratulating their daughter prior to meeting the new princess, who is fifth in line to the throne.

'We know today both happiness and warm thanks,' King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia said, according to Hello Magazine.

'Our
 joy is great. We wish now that Princess Madeleine and Christopher get 
peace and quiet and can take advantage of this unique time with her 
little daughter.'

The name and royal title of the baby have not yet been made public.

The palace also said in a statement that anyone wishing to send messages of congratulations to the new parents could do so on the royal family and Princess Madeleine's Facebook page.

Thirty-one
 year old Madeleine, whose full title is Madeleine Therese Amelie 
Josephine, Princess of Sweden, Duchess of Halsingland and Gastrikland, 
daughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, and O'Neill wed in 
June in Stockholm.

Sweden has a constitutional monarchy 
in which the royals primarily serve as figureheads. The king is the 
country's head of state, but his powers are limited to ceremonial 
duties.

'The Office of 
the Marshal of the Realm is delighted to announce that H.R.H. Princess 
Madeleine gave birth to a daughter on February 20, 2014 at 10.41 pm 
local time New York,' the Swedish court said.

'Both mother and child are in good health.'

The
 baby was born at New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center, 
and O'Neill was at the hospital during the entire delivery.

'Everything went well. The mother and child are doing well,' Royal Court spokeswoman Annika SÃ¶nnerberg told the TT news agency.

Prime Minister 
Fredrik Reinfeldt also issued a statement through his press secretary 
welcoming the newest member of the royal family.

'My
 warmest congratulations to Princess Madeleine and Chris O'Neill, who 
today became parents of a little girl. It's a big day for the Royal 
Court and for the new parents,' Reinfeldt said.

O'Neill maintained his US citizenship following his 
marriage to Princess Madeleine. If their child only takes US 
citizenship, she cannot be included in the line of succession.

Their
 child would also be barred from ascending to the Swedish throne if she 
doesn't grow up in Sweden or if she is raised Catholic, the religion of 
her father.

Public support 
for the ceremonial monarchy has weakened slightly in recent years, but 
remains fairly broad in otherwise egalitarian Sweden.

A Swedish royal expert called Princess Madeleine's New York birth 
'practical' but also said that many in Sweden would be 'disappointed'

Sweden's one-time 'party princess' 
lives with her American husband, 39, in New York where she works
 for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her 
mother, Queen Silvia.

The couple met after Princess Madeleine fled to the U.S. in 2010 with a broken heart.

She
 crossed the Atlantic following the breakdown of her first engagement to
 Swedish attorney Jonas Bergstrom amid speculation that he had cheated 
on her.

Rumors of a 
romance with O'Neill first emerged in early 2011 when the pair were 
seen together at the Central Park Boathouse.

A source told the New York Post at the time: 'She is always happy when she is with him.'

Madeleine says she and her husband were friends first, and a relationship blossomed over time.

From friends to lovers: Madeline said that she loves Chris for his 'big heart' and his 'sense of humor'
