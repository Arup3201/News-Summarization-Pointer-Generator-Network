It's starred on Jeopardy, helped with cancer research and even worked in a call centre but now Watson’s next job is in the public’s hands.

In February, the IBM Watson team asked firms to design mobile apps that take advantage of its supercomputer's processing power.

Hundreds of submissions have now been narrowed down to 25 finalists, including an app that lets you speak to an avatar of a famous person, and one that offers advice for expectant mothers. 

The three winners will be awarded 90 days access to the complex computer’s developer platform.

The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson's, pictured, cognitive computing capabilities. The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM. Three winners will get access to the Watson's developer platform

The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge was launched at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

It invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson’s cognitive computing capabilities to ‘analyse, discover insights and learn from Big Data’.

The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM.

The three winners will get access to the API as well as consultations from IBM Interactive design services.

The finalists are a mix of entertainment, health and innovation. For example, the Azoft team want to build an app ‘for anyone who wants to talk to an interesting and smart person, politician, scientist or celebrity’.

Ultramatics: Offers personalised answers to the most important health questions.

Voyager Innovations: Lets users shop surely and quickly.

Ringful Health: Lets patients have informed conversations with their doctors on healthcare decisions.

Majestyk Apps: A cognitive companion that improves education.

GenieMD: Lets users take a more active role in managing their health.

Red Ant: A sales trainer that lets employees easily identify individual customers’ likely interests.

BrightMinded: A virtual personal trainer that follows users through all aspects of their fitness experience.

9W Search: The next-generation approach to the consumption of financial information.

Strategia Tecnologia: Helps family farmers get answers to their questions about agriculture.

Acute Dynamics: Lets users view, execute and track activities related to their work.

CrayonData: Helps consumers simplify choices in every aspect of life.

GoGoHealth: Lets doctors diagnose and treat patients remotely, using evidence-based protocols.

Kutir: Lets hiring managers and recruiters identify potential hires and alerts candidates to openings.

InXero: Lets reseller businesses more efficiently reach customers on their offerings.

Instancy: A revolutionary personal learning guide.

Azoft: Lets users connect with any interesting and smart person, politician, scientist or celebrity.

Rumble: Newspaper and magazine apps with the highest level of user experience and personalization.

Inteliwise: A user-friendly AI-powered app that connects citizens and local city councils.

Biovideo: Puts the most helpful information for new and expectant mothers at their fingertips.

Activepackets: A personalized automobile research app.

Unified
 Computer Intelligence Corp: Lets users quickly order fresh ingredients 
from best-priced sources for delivery within hours.

Flexport: Makes international trade more accessible and affordable.

Ontodia: Concierge service lets users ask detailed questions about local government and private resources.

Sense.ly/MyIdealDoctor: Lets individuals and doctors quickly access information for unmatched healthcare.

Xoriant: Lets rural customers access microfinance organization and related data on the go.

They propose that Watson will be able to find answers to questions asked to a users’ idol that are found in public access pages, publications, interviews and books, but which are not easy to find through standard search engines.

Earlier this year Watson became a call centre worker. This graphic explains how the scheme worked

The team said: ‘Because we can focus Watson on particular sets of source materials to prepare answers and make Watson learn, it will produce an ultimate product that gives everyone a gift of real-life communication through Q&A with someone they’d only dreamt of talking to.’

‘Users can immediately ask questions or initiate conversations with people of their interest as in a regular instant-message service.

‘At later stages, we can implement speech recognition and text-to-speech ability.

Meanwhile, the Biovideo App has been designed to ‘provide the best help for new and expectant mothers at their fingertips.’

It uses the Baby 101 searchable database and plans to make the service available to all – it is currently limited by location. 

‘Providing the power of Watson to the Baby 101 program provides unlimited information, insight and reach to new parents,’ explained the proposal.

‘A mother with a sick child can ask Dr. Watson what’s wrong with her baby and get a 100 per cent accurate response from data Watson has pulled from trusted sources on the internet, including scientific journals.’

Elsewhere, the GoGoHealth app would let doctors and specialists diagnose and treat patients remotely.

Patients would log into their provider app, and the app makes a call to the Electronic Health Record system the doctor is using, pulls all history data, and asks the patients to specify their symptoms.

In 2011 IBM's Watson computer competed against Jeopardy's two most successful contestants, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. During the practice match Watson was given the same questions as the other contestants and could virtually press the buzzer to answer. In the majority of cases Watson beat both contestants

Based on the symptoms and history, the app would ask each patient questions to accurately assess the condition.

There are also fitness apps among the finalists, such as Brightminded.

According to the team behind the plans: ‘Watson can be the perfect fitness trainer, and to achieve that it needs to be with users during all aspects of their fitness journey: when they are at the gym, at the track or at the supplements shop.

‘We want to use Watson’s cognitive abilities to learn from users’ daily data - gathered from manual entry and wearable sensor technology, latest medical research and available online fitness expertise to determine what works for a user’s metabolism, physical structure, fat distribution, and hormonal profile.’

They said the Watson-powered app could change its recommendation as training progresses, or  goals change.

It could also recommend the best supplement products based on reviews and requirements, for example if the user is allergic to dairy.
