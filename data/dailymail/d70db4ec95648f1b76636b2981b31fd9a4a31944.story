When it comes to high street shops, Topshop undoubtedly holds the title as the coolest kid on the block so the Unique SS15 show today was the weekend's most anticipated - and Sir Philip Green sure knows how to blow every other show out of the water. 

The Arcadia boss called on his A-list pals, including Poppy Delevingne, Ellie Goulding, Laura Carmichael and Alexa Chung, to occupy the front row.

His model roll call was equally as starry. The pack was lead by none other than Cara Delevingne (she is the face of Topshop after all), followed by her best friend Jourdan Dunn, Lily Donaldson and Malaika Firth. 

Still with us? Good, because Brit favourites Matilda Lowther, Sam Rollinson and Charlotte Wiggins walked too and Kendall Jenner's sidekick Hailey Baldwin even flew in from LA to complete the formidable crew of Topshop clothes horses.

Look who it is! Cara Delevingne, who is the face of Topshop, lead the stellar model pack in today's Unique show, which served up some seriously sartorial options for SS15

But it wasn't just the celebrity attendance that got tongues wagging. If you took your eyes off the A-list frow (Cara's mother and Anna Wintour included), there were some really covetable clothes.

Head designer Emma Farrow (perhaps curating with her models in mind), was inspired by fun-loving youths who live for the weekend. Her girl? Someone with her own unique sense of style, who is not afraid to stand out from the crowd.

'For SS15, it's the faded glamour of the British seaside, from pier to Pleasure Beach,' she said of the inspiration. 

'At its core is a switched-on, youthful spirit - a dance-all-night, sea-sprayed celebration of British youth culture that lives for the weekend.'

Undeniably athletic in style, bold cycling jerseys in white, midnight blue and pillarbox red, were teamed with derrière-baring frilly knickers, which were as fun as they were flirty.

Designed to be worn from the sports hall to the dance floor, girly dresses were juxtaposed with a hint of laddy flair via camouflage prints and sporty cuts and nylons.

Baseball style tees were clean and bold in colour, often with monochrome stripes, while pistachio suits were embellished with dazzling jewels. 

More laidback looks came courtesy of off the shoulder tops, micro shorts and basketweave leathers.

After today's show, who doesn't want to be a Topshop girl?
