Alan Blacker, pictured, was given a public dressing down by a judge for looking 'something out of Harry Potter' in court

A furious judge gave a lawyer a public dressing down for looking like 'something out of Harry Potter' in court.

Judge David Wynn Morgan tore into solicitor-advocate Alan Blacker who bears a striking resemblance to Hagrid in the Harry Potter films.

Mr Blacker had sewn a set of what he claimed were ceremonial St John Ambulance medals on his left breast along with colourful ribbons.

Judge Morgan told him: 'If you want to look like something out of Harry Potter you can forget coming to this court ever again.

'I have been practising in these courts since 1978 and I have never seen a barrister or solicitor appear before these courts wearing a medal or with badges sewn onto his gown.

'Here in South Wales we had a barrister, who later became a judge, who had won during the Battle of Normandy the highest order of gallantry in a Victoria Cross.

'Did you ever see him wearing a medal? He would have considered it the height of vulgarity for such a thing to be done.

'If you ever appear before this court again dressed as you are I shall exercise my right to decline to hear you.'

Mr Blacker goes by the full name of Dr The Right Honourable The Lord Harley of Counsel of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem.

Mr Blacker's extraordinary dressing down happened at Cardiff Crown Court where he was representing a minibus driver accused of causing death by dangerous driving.

After the trial Judge Morgan questioned Mr Blacker's right as a solicitor advocate to wear the robes and wig of a barrister during the trial and asked whether he was a member of the Law Society.

Mr Blacker, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, explained he earned the title Lord Harley by inheriting an ancient Irish peerage from his father and was a fully qualified solicitor advocate allowed to wear the robes of a barrister.

Mr Blacker lists an extraordinary number of qualifications, languages and society memberships on his LinkedIn professional networking web page.

It carries glowing testimonials which describe him as the 'Mozart of the courtroom' and 'almost a national treasure'.

And he also states he is fluent in Urdu, Punjabi, Gujarati, Hindi, and the Luo language of Kenya and Tanzania.

After the case Mr Blacker said: 'My qualifications, status and offices were brought into disrepute and I was personally very upset by the comments made towards me.

'I am shocked to the core that my position has been questioned - which is I feel reflective of the sacrifice of thousands of men who have died for the freedoms that are referred to in the title of Lord Harley for almost 1,100 years.

'For his Honour to have criticised me in such a way has hurt me deeply.

'I cannot say any more for legal reasons but I am deeply upset for what I consider were baseless and unjustified comments.

'I asked to see the judge in his chambers afterwards and he declined and now I have to take advice on the matter.

'My bona fides are beyond any reproach.'

Today, the 42-year-old said: 'The medals are there to balance the playing field.

'My medals were awarded to me and bear the face of the Crown. They may be for voluntary medical service but they bear the face of the Queen.

'They are not some poxy swimming badge.

'They are very discreet and are there for when I appear in superior courts - it has never been an issue before.'

It is not clear what branch of St John Ambulance he belongs to. Mr Black said he represented people who cannot afford representation and often received little or no payment for his services.

He added: 'My reputation is widely known.

'I come from Lancashire, I speak with a Lancashire accent and work with Lancashire folk - I am nothing special.

'The trial isn't about me but when I am criticised personally throughout the trial the jury take a view of that.' 

Mr Blacker's client minibus driver Andrzej Wojcicki, 45, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.

Polish-born Wojcicki was looking at photographs on his mobile phone when he collided with cyclist Owain James, 30, at Newbridge, South Wales.
