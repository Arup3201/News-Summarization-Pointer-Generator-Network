Abou Diaby is set to miss Sunday's Community Shield clash with Manchester City, after suffering yet another injury setback.

The injury-prone Arsenal midfielder missed almost the entirety of last season with a knee problem, making his only appearance  in their final game  against Norwich City, and looked set to a return to the first-team fold.

He returned for the Gunners in their first pre-season friendly against Boreham Wood in July, but is believed to have picked up the hip problem during their US Tour game against New York Red Bulls.

Doubt: Abou Diaby is set to miss the Community Shield on Sunday with a hip injury

Hope: There was belief at the squad that he could make a real return to prominence this campaign

It had been hoped that Diaby would be able to start the season injury-free, with Arsene Wenger hoping to use the player in a defensive midfield role. 

But it now appears certain that he will miss the curtain-raiser at Wembley, and there is also no reported timescale on his comeback.

Diaby is currently Arsenal's longest-serving player, having signed for the club in January 2006, but a succession of injury problems have limited him to just 179 appearances in that time - and just 21 in the last three seasons.

Unlucky: The midfielder has suffered from a string of injuries that have limited his appearances over the years
