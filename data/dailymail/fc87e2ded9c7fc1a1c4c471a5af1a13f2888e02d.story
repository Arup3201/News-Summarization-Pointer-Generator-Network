The culture of lavish bonuses for bankers is back in full swing, after Barclays and Lloyds revealed that 500 staff pocketed more than £1million last year.

Critics accused the banks of a  ‘disgraceful act of greed and betrayal’ and urged Chancellor George Osborne to intervene.

The revelations came as both High Street lenders published their annual reports.

State-backed Lloyds confirmed its boss Antonio Horta-Osorio received £4.5million in pay and perks last year, while Barclays revealed it has lined up 1,000 senior staff for ‘role-based’ allowances to avoid a bonus cap from Brussels.

Other details include:

Banks have repeatedly vowed to show restraint on pay. Just last month Barclays chief Antony Jenkins promised his bank understood public outrage, saying: ‘There will be no going back to the old way of doing things. We get it.’

But critics said Mr Jenkins’ comments were at odds with the reality, which saw Barclays pay 481 people more than £1million last year, up from 428 in 2012. Mr Jenkins claimed the bank needed to pay big bonuses to avoid a ‘death spiral’ of top investment bankers leaving to join rivals.

But critics pointed out that Barclays’ top talent steered the bank to a 32 per cent fall in profits to £5.2billion last year.

Despite this the High Street giant saw fit to hike its bonuses to £2.4billion, with its ‘casino bankers’ receiving £60,100 on average.

Last night the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee of MPs blasted the failure of UK banks to show restraint, more than six years after the onset of the financial crisis.

Tory MP Andrew Tyrie said: ‘It is regrettable that a number of banks appear not to have accepted the need for fundamental reform in this year’s bonus round.’

‘The new consensus emerging on pay remains seriously flawed,’ he added.

Rob MacGregor, of union Unite, said: ‘This is a disgraceful act of greed and betrayal by these brass-necked bankers.

Lloyds Banking Group recently announced that it will set-aside 1.8 billion Pounds (2.1 billion Euros) for claims of mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI)

‘George Osborne now has a duty to the 
people of this country to step in and act to curb the continued excesses
 of the banking elite.’

A 
spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which lobbies for a tax on 
financial transactions, said: ‘Instead of fighting to protect the 
grotesque pay levels of their friends in the City, the Government should
 be reining the sector in and ensuring it contributes more to society.’

Both
 Barclays and Lloyds also revealed plans to hand their chief executives 
hefty ‘allowances’, on top of their salaries and other share awards, to 
circumvent new EU rules capping bonuses.

In
 total around 1,000 top earners at Barclays will also receive generous 
‘role-based’ payments in cash and shares, to supplement their basic 
incomes.

Mr Jenkins is in line for a £950,000 shares windfall on top of his £1.1milion basic salary and £363,000 pension.

Although the maximum amount he can receive falls, it means he is now guaranteed to receive more than £2.4million every year.

Stuart Gulliver, HSBC Group CEO has also sidestepped EU rules, and is expected to be worth around £7.5 million after being given bonuses on top of his £1.25 million basic salary

Similarly,
 Mr Horta-Osorio will receive a £900,000 shares payment to top up his 
£1.1million salary and £681,000 in pension and benefits. His basic pay 
package rises from £1.7million to £2.6million,

Both
 banks also revealed what their top earners pocketed in 2013. At 
Barclays the eight highest paid took home more than £5million apiece, 
while Lloyds said 27 staff were paid more than €1million (£820,000), 
compared with 25 paid more than £1million last year.

They failed to explain why they used euros this year, rather than pounds.

The
 two lenders also said they were planning to seek shareholder approval 
to increase the maximum bonus a banker can get to 200 per cent of 
salary. This is the maximum amount allowed under the new EU bonus cap 
introduced in January.

Barclays’
 lavish awards came despite the bank admitting that it is embroiled in 
at least 12 separate probes into misconduct by staff.

These
 include allegations its traders rigged foreign currency rates and a 
Serious Fraud Office probe into its emergency fundraising with Qatar 
investors in 2008.
