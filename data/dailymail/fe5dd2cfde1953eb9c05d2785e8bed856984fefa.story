The world is facing a sixth 'great extinction' with 41 per cent of amphibians set to be wiped off the face of Earth, according to a new study.

The research also claims just over a quarter of all mammal species and 13 per cent of birds could go the same way as the dodo as a result of human activities.

And this could happen by 2200 if species continue to disappear at their current rate, researchers claim.

Many creatures are currently critically endangered including the Magellanic penguin, the Sumatran elephant and the Amur leopard – but more familiar animals could soon be added to that list. 

This is according to an analysis carried out by scientific journal, Nature, which blames the loss of habitat from man-made activities as a key reason behind the change.  

'In general, the state of biodiversity is worsening, in many cases significantly,' said Derek Tittensor, a marine ecologist with the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge.

He added that habitat destruction, pollution and over-fishing either kills off wild creatures and plants or leaves them badly weakened.

The additional threat of worsening climate change will become more and more pronounced and could then kill off these survivors, he said.

Gaps in scientists' understanding about the Earth's biodiversity, according to Nature, is increasing the problem.

For instance, the study found that at least 993 insects are threatened with extinction, but only 0.5 per cent of roughly 1 million known species have so far been studied. 

It claims that most of the unknown groups of endangered species inhabit small regions of the world, often in habitats that are rapidly being destroyed.

Conservation policies could slow extinctions, but current trends suggest the extinction rate is still between 0.01 per cent to 0.7 per cent of all existing species each year.

And the effects of climate change may make matters worse, accelerating extinctions in unknown ways, the editorial warns.

In July, a separate analysis published in Science, also found that a 'sixth mass extinction' is underway.

It said that while previous extinctions have been driven by natural planetary transformations or catastrophic asteroid strikes, the current die-off can be associated to human activity.

Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth

Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago

This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species.

Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago

Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species.

Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago

The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived.

Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago

There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species.

Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago

The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.

Since 1500, more than 320 terrestrial vertebrates have become extinct. 

Populations of the remaining species show a 25 per cent average decline in abundance, and the situation is similarly dire for invertebrate animal life. 

Human population has doubled in the past 35 years; in the same period, the number of invertebrate animals – such as beetles, butterflies, spiders and worms – has decreased by 45 per cent.

As with larger animals, the loss is driven primarily by loss of habitat and global climate disruption, and could have trickle-up effects in our everyday lives.

For instance, insects pollinate roughly 75 per cent of the world's food crops, an estimated 10 per cent of the economic value of the world's food supply.

A recent study by Brown University has also found that humans are causing species to die off as much as 1,000 times faster than they did 60 million years ago, according to a new US study.
