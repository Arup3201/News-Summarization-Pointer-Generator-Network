The widow of a 7/7 London bombing victim is facing jail after stealing £50,000 compensation awarded to her son.

Adam Gray, who was 11 when his father was killed, took his mother to court when she refused to repay the money she had blown on a spree that included four new cars, shopping at luxury stores and dining out at the Ritz.

After the death of accountant Richard Gray, 41, in the 2005 terror attacks, Adam was awarded £50,000 by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority to secure his financial future.

Adam was 11-years-old when his father Richard was killed in the suicide bomb attack on a Tube train near Aldgate station in 2005 (pictured). He was left £50,000 compensation and it was put in a trust until he was 18

It was placed in a trust fund and later entrusted to his mother Louise Gray, 42, to look after until he needed it.

But when Mr Gray, from Ipswich, Suffolk, asked for his money to fund a move to London, she confessed it was all gone.

When she refused to repay it, the police launched an investigation and eventually charged her with theft. She has now pleaded guilty and has been told it is likely she will be jailed.

Mr Gray, 20, said: ‘I supported the police’s investigation. Justice needs to be served.

‘It’s been more than a year since I confronted Mum over stealing my compensation and she’s never shown any real remorse or made any attempts to pay me back.

‘That money was supposed to safeguard my future but she’s left me penniless. I’ve lost my dad and now I’ve lost my mum.’

Tax manager Richard was one of seven passengers killed by a suicide bomber on a Circle Line train near Aldgate station. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority later awarded £250,000 to his wife, £50,000 to Mr Gray and £100,000 to his sister Ruby, now 16.

The children’s money was put in trust funds until they were 18. But Mr Gray claimed the cash changed his mother and she quit her carer’s job before embarking on a life of indulgence, splashing out on cars, expensive shopping sprees, a Jacuzzi and seven chihuahua dogs. 

When he was given access to his £50,000 payout in July 2012, Mr Gray worried he would not be able to cope with such a large amount and asked his mother to look after it for him.

He made her promise she would not spend it before entrusting her with the funds, but 18 months later, when he asked for the money to take up an apprenticeship in London, she admitted she did not have it any more.

Mr Gray took his mother to the civil court, and in June was awarded £43,750. She appealed unsuccessfully against the ruling, and then refused to reimburse her son.

She was charged with theft in September, which she admitted at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday.

After the hearing, charity worker Mr Gray said he had no choice but to take legal action.

He said: ‘The police started looking into the case as soon as I took my mother to the civil court.

‘They believed it was a criminal case because it was effectively theft. She had stolen from me.

Louise spent the £50,000 on lavish shopping sprees, a fleet of new cars, dinner at the Ritz, seven dogs and a jacuzzi for the family home. She has now been warned she faces jail. Pictured: The Aldgate Tube bombing

‘I felt confusion when the police told me she could face prison. But at the same time I wanted some justice for what she had done to me.’

He added: ‘She never showed me any remorse and she made me feel as if everything was my fault. Although it is hard to think of your own mother going to prison because of a crime she has committed against you, I believe that I deserve some form of justice.

‘Hopefully she will be forced to pay me the money now. But I should not have had to go to such extreme lengths. Sadly, she left me no choice.’

Gray will be sentenced next month.
