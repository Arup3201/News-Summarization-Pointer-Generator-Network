Fran Kirby scored on her debut as England's women eased past Sweden in a friendly at Hartlepool.

England put in a superb display against the Swedes, who had beaten them 4-1 the last time the two sides met, to run out 4-0 winners at Victoria Park.

Liverpool midfielder Fara Williams led the team out for her 130th appearance, as she became England's most capped player.

England (4-3-3): Bardsley; Scott, Houghton, Bronze (Bassett 71), Stokes (Greenwood 76); Williams (C) (Scott 76), Nobbs, Carney; Kirby (Duggan 61), Taylor (Aluko 61), Sanderson.

Sweden (4-1-3-2): Lindahl (Soberg 46); Nilsson, Fischer (Ilestedt 37), Berglund (Sembrant 69), Thunebro; Seger (Lundh 60), Jakobsson (Hjohlman 46), Asllani (Dahlkvist 46), Folkesson; Schelin (C), Sjogran.

Goals: Carney (36, 80), Kirby (53), Sanderson (68) 

And it was an occasion to remember for Williams, as England dominated from start to finish against the side ranked fifth in the World.

Karen Carney put the Lionesses ahead soon after the half-hour mark, converting the rebound after she had hit the post from the penalty spot. However, there was an element of controversy about the goal, as it appeared that no-one had touched the ball between Carney's spot-kick and her rebound strike.

England continued on the front foot in the second half, with Kirby firing in a deserved debut goal from insided the box before Lianne Sanderson made it 3-0 in the 68th minute.

The first of many: Kirby enjoys scoring her first international goal to put England 2-0 up

Threesy does it: Lianne Sanderson slots home from six yards to make it 3-0, before Carney completed the rout

Carney completed the rout by curling in her second from the edge of the box with 10 minutes to play, as England outclassed their opponents.

Karen Bardsley in the home goal was forced into a save by Sweden for the first time in the 87th minute, although she had earlier prevented Carney scoring an own goal. 

Mark Sampson's side face Wales in their next game, knowing that a draw will see them qualify for the 2015 World Cup in Canada.

If they can replicated this standard of performance, qualification is all but assured.
