Riots have broken out in southern France over the death of a young activist killed by a police grenade.

At least 16 people were arrested in Toulouse as rubbish bins were torched and bus shelters smashed during a demonstration in the French city.

The riots unfolded on the margins of an otherwise peaceful march where protesters carried placards reading 'End to the licence to kill'.

At one point during the stand-off, demonstrators were dispersed by powerful jets of water.

It was the latest clash in a series of demonstrations which have embarrassed the Socialist government.

The chaotic scenes came just weeks after Remi Fraisse, 21, was killed by a so-called 'offensive grenade' during a standoff between police and opponents of a dam project in wetlands near Toulouse.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve later ordered these devices banned.

Around 600 to 1,000 protesters later marched in Toulouse and 1,200 in the western city of Nantes, where 14 were arrested. 

The death has further soured relations between President Francois Hollande's Socialist government and the Green Party, a one-time government partner.

The protests over the planned dam add to a growing number of environmental protests again infrastructure projects that have included stalled plans to build a new airport in Nantes

The party said the government has not reacted properly to Fraisse's death and has accused Cazeneuve of initially hiding the truth.

Remi Fraisse's death in October was the first in a mainland France protest since 1986, and has been blamed on a concussion grenade fired by police. He was one of 2,000 activists protesting against the £7m Sivens dam project.
