Blow for Chris Grayling: Judges ruled a crackdown on legal aid for immigrants was 'unlawful'

Judges have inflicted a humiliating blow on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling after ruling a crackdown on legal aid for immigrants was ‘unlawful’.

The Court of Appeal said guidelines determining whether public money should be given to people threatened with deportation so they could fight the case were ‘too restrictive’.

The guidance was wrong because it demanded a ‘very high threshold’ for handing out legal aid when someone was facing being thrown out of Britain and said funding should only be granted in cases which were ‘rare and extreme’.

Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, yesterday upheld a High Court decision that the rules were ‘unlawful’.

The Ministry of Justice must now redraft the guidelines and reassess funding for some immigrants, including Cleon Reis, a 28-year-old Portuguese national who has committed a ‘considerable number’ of crimes.

The ruling is another blow to Mr Grayling who earlier this month was told a ban on sending books to inmates in jail was unlawful.

And last week a paedophile and a dangerous armed robber were controversially awarded hundreds of pounds in compensation because delays in the prison system breached their human rights.

The case centres on guidelines about exceptional funding, which sets out who is still eligible to apply for legal aid in certain immigration cases following the Government's legal aid cuts.

The scheme was intended to act as a ‘safety net’ but Lord Dyson, sitting with Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Sullivan, said the MoJ had ordered it be applied too stringently.

He said: ‘It correctly identifies many of the factors that should be taken into account in deciding whether to grant exceptional funding, but it neutralises their effect by wrongly stating that the threshold for funding is very high and that legal aid is required only in rare and extreme cases.’

The appeal court considered five cases of immigrants who had been refused legal aid under the scheme.

The MoJ lost on three cases, which means the claimants must be reassessed for funding.

They include Reis. He has been jailed several times, including for stealing a car and crashing it during a high-speed chase while trying to flee police.

Mr Grayling introduced the crackdown on legal aid in a bid to trim the bill by £350million a year by 2015.

There were wide-ranging changes to the provision and scope of legal aid, including for immigration cases.

Immigrants could apply for ‘exceptional case funding’ to secure legal aid but this should be withheld unless it would make challenging a deportation ruling ‘practically impossible’.

Previous warning: Shadow Justice Minister Andy Slaughter (pictured) said the Government's legal aid cuts were 'rushed through before preparing the necessary evidence to justify them'

In 2013-14, there were 235 applications for legal aid funding in immigration cases and only four were granted – suggesting the bar was set too high, said critics.

Shadow Justice Minister Andy Slaughter said: ‘The Government's legal aid cuts were rushed through before preparing the necessary evidence to justify them.

‘Labour, alongside most of the legal profession, warned that this would raise substantial barriers to access to justice. David Cameron should listen and fix the mess he has created.’

Nicholas Lavender, chairman of the Bar Council, said: ‘People who are refused legal are being denied access to justice.

‘If, as is so often the case, they are unable to present their own case effectively, then it is simply not heard and the courts cannot do their job. This is a breach of their human rights.

‘The Government must urgently improve access to justice for these people, who are among the most vulnerable in society.’

The MoJ said it would ‘carefully consider’ its next steps following the ruling.

A spokesman said: ‘We continue to believe that the exceptional funding scheme is functioning as intended. Its purpose is to provide funding where it is legally needed.

‘Legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but resources are not limitless and must be properly targeted at the cases that need it most.

‘The system must be sustainable and fair for those who use it and the taxpayers who pay for it.’
