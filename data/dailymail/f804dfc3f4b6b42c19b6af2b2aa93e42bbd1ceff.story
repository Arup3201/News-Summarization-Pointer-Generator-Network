A police force will allow people with just four weeks training to interview criminal suspects alone in a bid to cut costs.

Sussex Police has revealed plans to recruit 32 Response Investigators on a starting salary of £20,020 a year to help free up police officers to be out on the street.

A job description says they will be expected to manage their own caseload which will involve investigating crimes, gathering evidence, appearing in court and dealing with victims.

Controversial: Sussex Police will employ people with four weeks of training to investigate crimes to cut costs

But despite the onerous nature of the role, applicants do not need to have any policing qualifications or experience whatsoever.

The advert states: 'Having experience of criminal justice 
procedures and investigations is helpful but not essential. We're 
looking for the right person with the right attitude for this role, we 
can teach you the rest through our bespoke 4 week training programme 
upon joining.'

Questions: Keith Vaz MP suggested some tasks should only be performed by experienced police officers

Sussex Police said Response Investigation Teams (RITs) will be 'removed from front line policing' but allow officers to get back out onto the streets more quickly.

But critics say the new recruits, who will employed on a fixed 18-month contract, will amount to 'plastic police' who should not be carrying out the work of more experienced officers.

Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told The Times that certain tasks should never be done by non-police officers.

'I think that interviewing suspects is along those lines,' he told the newspaper.

'A decent lawyer will make mincemeat out of an interview done by someone without the background and knowledge of a police officer.'

Paul Sellings, chair of Sussex Police Federation, echoed his concerns and described the RITs as 'policing on the cheap'.

'Sussex Police has got cash for 18 months but when you employ police officers you employ them for 30-odd years. The force cannot afford to do this. It is policing on the cheap but it has got to be – because they only have the budget for 18 months,' he told The Argus.

But Katy Bourne, Sussex Police & Crime Commissioner, insisted the recruitment is justified.

'This will allow for more officers to be out in the community; one of the things that local people have told me matters most to them,' she said.

Assistant Chief Constable Robin Merrett added: 'We are able to recruit and train these staff quicker than would be the case with officers and they will provide resilience within the RITs - but they are not a replacement for officers.'
