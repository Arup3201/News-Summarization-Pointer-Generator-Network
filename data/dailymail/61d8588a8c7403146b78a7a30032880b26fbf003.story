Filippo Inzaghi still has the full backing of the AC Milan dressing room despite a poor Serie A campaign, according to striker Jeremy Menez. 

Milan lost 3-1 to Lazio on Saturday, with Menez scoring the Rossoneri's only goal, and the two sides are now preparing to meet again on Tuesday night, in the Coppa Italia.

'In the dressing room we're fine, the players are always with Inzaghi,' French international Menez said ahead of the tie.

Jeremy Menez, AC Milan striker, has told press that the AC Milan dressing room are fully behind their manager

'It is true we are going through a difficult time. We have to stand up and get back to working hard for a good result because we all want this.'

Some claim that Inzaghi's future as Milan manager rests solely on Tuesday's cup clash. With the team sitting 11th in Serie A, the Coppa Italia is their only hope of salvaging a disastrous season.

'It is true that the match against Lazio is very important for us,' Menez continued, 'for the coach and for the fans, but we should not put extra pressure on ourselves.' 

Inzaghi's side currently sit 11th in Serie A after a poor first half of the season, but are still in the Coppa Italia

Milan beat Sassuolo 2-1 in the previous round, a team just one point behind them in the league, but now face a much tougher clash in the form of fourth-placed Lazio.

There are still concerns over Milan's strike force, with most of Tuesday's Italian papers listing the candidates that Inzaghi is looking at. 

Roma's Mattia Destro remains top of their wanted list, but Sassuolo striker Simone Zaza is also on their radar.
