Cowering behind a locked door of a safe room, she endured threatening screams of ‘I will kill you’ as five thugs tried to force their way in. Next door, her husband lay dying in a pool of his own blood.

This is the harrowing scenario detailed by Sonja Parkinson in an official police report, seen exclusively by The Mail on Sunday, which reveals the moment burglars fatally attacked her husband, retired British Army officer David Parkinson, at their home in northern Kenya last Sunday.

The first-hand account by Mrs Parkinson, 60, describes how the gang broke into their house in the Lolldaiga Hills in Nanyuki just before 1am and hacked her husband to death with a machete.

‘While already in my bed with my 
husband, I heard voices of people asking for guns and money,’ she says 
in the written statement. ‘I was surprised by the voices and two 
flashlights.

'There 
were no other lights in the house. Immediately they entered our bedroom,
they concentrated on my husband, David, asking for money and guns.

'The other thugs were busy looking for our valuable property, taking two iPads and one Toshiba laptop.

‘My
husband said, “I will give you money”, but one of the thugs who had a 
machete cut my husband on the left hand and left him profusely bleeding 
and lying down beside our bed dying.’

Mrs
Parkinson said the men then tied her hands behind her back and asked 
her for the key to their safe. ‘I lured them to where the safe room is, 
pretending that I was to show them the cash safe,’ she continued.

‘Luckily,
I got into the room, locked the door behind me and untied my hands 
.  .  . The thugs banged on the door shouting “I will kill you” but they
were not able to enter the room because the safe room has a metal 
door.’

The ordeal lasted 30 minutes before the intruders left, smashing through a rear bedroom door. It was only then that Mrs Parkinson left the safe room to find her husband dead on the couple’s bed.

Kenyan police say that as well as being sliced with the machete, Lieut Col Parkinson was also shot in the leg. They believe that the resulting wounds resulted in him bleeding to death very quickly.

Springwatch presenter Simon King last night paid tribute to Lieut Col Parkinson, who he had known for more than a decade through their work at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya.

Mr King said that Lieut Col Parkinson’s death was ‘a loss to Kenya, a loss to the community and a loss to the world. He was, simply, a very good human being.’

Locals confirmed last night that Mrs Parkinson has moved back into the family home where the murder of her husband of 36 years took place, but has installed bars across all the windows and stationed ‘heavily armed guards’ around the building.

The couple’s two daughters, Anna, 33, and Renate, 29, are also staying with her.

Staying: Mrs Parkinson said she has no intention of leaving Kenya, where she lived with her husband for more than a decade

Despite her traumatic experience, Mrs Parkinson said she has no intention of leaving Kenya, where she lived with her husband for more than a decade following his retirement from the Army in 2003. 

In her statement to the police, she added: ‘We have a good relationship with all our neighbours.’

However, detectives now say that one man they are questioning is a neighbour of the pair.

He was taken in after being identified by police sniffer dogs. While the police have still not charged the suspect, they were granted more time to question him in custody on Friday.

A memorial service for Lieut Col Parkinson, who received an OBE in 1998, was held yesterday.
