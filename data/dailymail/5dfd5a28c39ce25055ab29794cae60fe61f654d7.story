Nestled among the emerald hills of the Derbyshire Peak District, the Old Post Office sits in an idyllic spot at the centre of a postcard-perfect village.

Parwich, near Ashbourne, is inside the Peak District National Park, favourite destination of hikers and mountain-bikers. Its village green, babbling brook, cosy pub and stone cottages make it a place people tend not to want to leave.

In fact, the Old Post Office had been in the same hands for nearly  90 years when the current owners bought it in 2005. It was run by the Graham family from 1918 until 1984, when the last Miss Graham retired from the role of postmistress.

The counter used to be in the room now transformed into a farmhouse-style kitchen/diner, complete with cream Aga, tiled floor and a bowl of eggs laid by the children's chickens. 'My husband used to come in here as a child to buy stamps,' says owner Tracy-Ann Ingham.

The 17th Century, Grade II listed house has many untouched period features, including a complete cast-iron range in the sitting room with its ovens still intact. This is where Tracy-Ann warms her mince pies and mulled wine at Christmas, and dries the kindling for the open fire.

On the other side of the hallway is a second, smaller sitting room with a log-burner, which the family use as a snug but could become a dining room, playroom or spacious study.

The ground floor is completed by a large utility room with tiled flooring and a butler's sink, along with a cloakroom and separate boot room.

Upstairs, the bedrooms are as charming and distinctive  as the rooms below. Old wooden doors lead into four bedrooms with original fireplaces and window recesses deep enough to sit in.

There's also a bathroom and a shower room on this floor, while the pitched and beamed attic has been turned into a fifth bedroom with an en suite bathroom, currently given over to the Inghams' nanny.

The whole house has been beautifully refurbished and tastefully decorated, mostly in light colours that allow the beams, sash windows and other architectural quirks to speak for themselves. 'We bought the Post Office from one of the postmistress's nephews,' says Tracy-Ann. 'We put in a new kitchen, including the Aga, and floor tiles from Hopton Wood, a local quarry. We completely did up the attic, which was previously used for storage, and put in new bathrooms.'

The Old Post Office also generates an income, no longer from sending off parcels but from the holiday cottage that Tracy-Ann, 40, and husband Simon, 41, created a few years ago out of an old stone stable behind the main house.

Winning a four-star Gold Award from the Tourist Board, it's as characterful as the house, with a brick horse trough and an owl hole above the door, originally to let owls (good mouse-hunters) in and out.The pretty cottage has a double bedroom and bathroom on the ground floor, with a sitting room  and kitchen on the first. It also  has its own sun-trap patio and is often booked by couples as a romantic getaway (The Stable, sykes cottages.co.uk). 'We let it all through the year; people come for long weekends even in the low season,' says Tracy-Ann.

The Inghams have also converted a former pigsty in the garden into an office, though it has been unused since former Army captain Simon took over the family business, Bennetts department store, which has outlets in Ashbourne and Derby. With a mini-kitchen and log-burner, it must be one of the cosiest pigsties in Derbyshire.

The spacious kitchen

The garden is unusually large for a village house and slopes gently upwards from the stone steps that connect it to the flagstone courtyard. Tracy-Ann says that when they first bought the house, you could hardly get through to the garden for all the brambles, but it is now a haven for the games of the Inghams' four children: Annabelle, seven, who keeps the chickens; Thomas, five; and two-year-old twins Charlotte and Alice.

There's a hammock slung between two trees, an outdoor pizza oven built by Simon, stone seats in the walls and plenty of trees to climb, some of which are laden with apples, pears and damsons. At the top of the one-and-a-half-acre garden is a section that was once a paddock and could easily be one again, with another stable in its far corner. Surrounded by trees, the garden is secluded and faces south, catching the sun all day.

'In the summer we get sunshine at the top of the garden until 8pm,' says Tracy-Ann, standing at a point in the garden that has a lovely view down towards the house. 'I will miss this spot. You feel that you are  both in the village and outside it because it's so private.'

After eight years, the Inghams have found another house, with larger rooms than the Old Post Office, that they would like to live in, and have put their home on the market for £850,000.

They have no intention, however, of going very far, as the new house is in the same village.

Like other residents, such as the Graham family who lived at the  Old Post Office for the best part of  a century, they have no plans to leave Parwich.
