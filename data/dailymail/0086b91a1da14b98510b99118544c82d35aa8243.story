More than 120 people are believed to have been killed at a protest in support of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi, according to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Security forces are reported to have started shooting demonstrators shortly 
before pre-dawn morning prayers at a round-the-clock 
vigil in Cairo being staged by backers of Morsi, who was removed from power by the army three weeks ago.

Makeshift field hospitals around the area near the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque were overwhelmed, with one doctor telling the BBC that more than 1,000 had been injured.

The state health ministry currently says that only 65 people had died and 750 suffered injuries.

However, Al Jazeera Egypt reported that some 4,500 may have been injured in the early morning violence.

Military-backed authorities were feeling emboldened today after millions turned out for nationwide rallies on Friday called by the army chief.

A leading figure of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, Mohammed el-Beltagy, blamed the violence on army chief General Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's call for rallies on Friday.

Hundreds of 
thousands of people came onto the streets after army
 chief General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,
 who played a central role in overthrowing the president, called for 
Egyptians to rally to give him a mandate to tackle 'violence and 
terrorism'.

Reporters at the scene said firing could still be heard hours after the troubles started.

'They are not shooting to wound, they are shooting to kill,' said pro-Morsi Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad.

The deaths occurred hours after supporters and opponents of Morsi staged
 mass rival rallies across the country.

Ragab Nayel Ali, one of the pro-Morsi protesters, said security forces fired first with tear gas and birdshot.

'Protesters replied by hurling rocks and started building walls,' said Ali, who was injured in an accident as he ferried wounded on his motorcycle from the fighting to a field hospital.

The fighting is the country's bloodiest incidence of violence since the army deposed Mohammed Morsi earlier this month.

British Foreign Secretary William 
Hague said: 'I am deeply concerned by recent events in Egypt, and 
condemn the use of force against protesters which has led to the loss of
 lives.'

But Muslim Brotherhood supporters also staged mass counter-rallies, 
demanding the reinstatement of Morsi, who was placed under investigation
 on Friday for a raft of crimes, including murder.

More than 200 people have died in 
violence since the overthrow of Morsi, including at least nine on 
Friday, most of them Brotherhood supporters.

Mr Haddad said the latest deaths came after police started firing repeated rounds of
 teargas around 3am at protesters who had 
spilled out of the main area of the Rabaa sit-in.

'Through the smog of the gas, the 
bullets started flying,' he said.

He claimed 'special police forces 
in black uniforms' were firing live rounds and that snipers shot from 
the roofs of a university, buildings in the area, and a bridge.

State news agency MENA quoted an unnamed security source as saying that 
only teargas was used to disperse protesters. He said no firearms were 
used.

Mr Haddad said the pro-Morsi supporters had used rocks to try to defend 
themselves.

On the podium outside the Rabaa mosque, a speaker urged 
people to retreat from the gunfire, but Mr Haddad said 'men stayed to defend themselves
 because women and children are inside the sit-in'.

Senior Brotherhood politician Saad el-Hosseini said: 'I have been trying to make the youth 
withdraw for five hours. I can't. They are saying have paid with their 
blood and they do not want to retreat.'

Egypt's army-installed interior 
minister, Mohamed Ibrahim, said on Friday that the month-old Cairo 
vigils by Morsi supporters would be 'brought to an end, soon and in a 
legal manner', state-run al Ahram news website reported.

Yesterday the country's new rulers 
accused Morsi of conspiring with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas 
and plotting to attack police stations, army officers and prisons during
 the 2011 uprising against former president Hosni Mubarak.

During the 2011 struggles, he had 
escaped from a prison and has now been accused of the 'premeditated 
killing of officers, soldiers and prisoners'.

Ousted: Former president Mohammed Morsi has been formally accused of a raft of crimes and is expected to be charged

Backing: Supporters of Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi take part in a demonstration in the city of Alexandria, where at least five people died

The announcement by prosecutors of the 
investigation against Morsi is likely to pave the way to a formal
 indictment and eventually a trial.

It was the first news of his legal 
status since he was deposed by the military on July 3. Since then, the 
Islamist leader has been held incommunicado in a secret location.

Besides Morsi, five other senior figures from the group have been detained. Hassan Mohammed, a 30-year old teacher who came from southern Egypt to join the pro-Morsi rally, remained steadfast.

'Even
 if we are going to die, me and my family, we won't leave this place 
before our president comes back. Even if it takes seven years. We are 
ready to be martyrs in the name of religion and the nation,' he said.
