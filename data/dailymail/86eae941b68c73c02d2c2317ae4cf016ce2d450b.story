The neighbor of a doctor accused of murdering his wife with a cocktail of prescription drugs has demonstrated how she found the woman's 'greenish pale' body in a bathtub after the couple's six-year-old daughter begged her for help.

Martin MacNeill, 57, is accused of 
killing his wife, Michele, after convincing her to get a face-lift and 
giving her the drugs during her recovery so he could continue his affair 
with their children's nanny.

In court in Provo, Utah on Friday - the second day of the trial - prosecutors used a model of the bath where she was found wearing only a black shirt in their Pleasant Grove home on April 11, 2007.

The couple's neighbor, Kristi Daniels, 
testified on Friday that she found Michele listless body in a bathtub wearing
only the shirt and with skin that was a 'greenish pale' color.

She had raced to the house after the couple's six-year-old daughter, Ada, knocked on her door and said simply: 'My dad needs some help.'

When Daniels went to the house, she could hear MacNeill's screams from outside.

She went to the bathroom, where MacNeill said he needed a man's help to get her out and she called her husband Doug, who also testified on Friday.

Despite their efforts to revive her, Michele was pronounced dead two hours later.

Kristi said that a few day later, MacNeill told her his wife had died of natural causes.

'He told me she had died of a heart problem, like a basketball player that had just died suddenly on the court,' Daniels said.

Testimony: Daniels, who lived next door, said she ran to the home after their six-year-old asked for help

Both of the Daniels testified that they only became aware of Gypsy Willis, the children's Nanny, being around the house after Michele's death.

Doug said that he first saw her 'a week or two' after Michele died and would later see Willis and MacNeill running errands or taking trips together without the children.

In the trial on Friday, there was also testimony from a dispatcher, police and paramedics.

The 911 dispatcher who handled MacNeillâ€™s call, Heidi Peterson, testified that they initially had to guess where to send emergency responders as MacNeill was so frantic they could not understand him.

A recording of the call shows him 
desperately begging for help and rudely dismissing the dispatcher. He 
also hung up the phone on her despite her pleas for him to stay on the 
line.

Prosecutors said 
MacNeill was hell-bent of forcing his wife to have a face lift and then 
pressed the plastic surgeon for drugs she didn't need so that he could 
give her the fatal dose.

Medical examiners can't determine exactly how the 50-year-old woman died. A doctor who examined her before the face-lift testified she was generally healthy.

Defense attorneys say it was from heart disease, not because of any actions of her husband, although they acknowledged during opening statements that he wasn't the easiest defendant to identify with.

'Martin has made poor choices in his life. He had affairs during his marriage,' defense lawyer Susanne Gustin said in her opening statement.

'We may think he's a total jerk and disgusting. And that's natural. But decide this case on the facts rather than the emotion.'

Frantic: Also on Friday, Heidi Peterson, the 911 dispatch manager who answered his call, testified and said that she could often not understand MacNeill as he was so frantic. He also hung up on her

MacNeill, 57, was charged in August 2012, nearly five years after his wife was found in the couple's Pleasant Grove home.

The
case shocked the Mormon community of Provo, 45 miles south of Salt Lake
City, because the suspect was a doctor and had been a church leader.

He was clinical director at the Utah State Hospital but has surrendered his medical license.

The drugs his wife was taking weren't common for someone getting a face-lift, the surgeon, Dr. Scott Thomson, testified on Thursday.

He said he would not normally prescribe Valium or Oxycodone, among other painkillers and sleeping pills, for recovery, but did so 'because Martin was a physician and he asked me for these things'.

Affair: Michele, left, was allegedly killed so that her husband could continue his affair with the children's nanny, Gypsy Willis, right. They had been seeing each other for a year-and-a-half before the death

Family: MacNeill had worked as a Mormon bishop and had eight children, pictured, with his wife

Michele required only antibiotics, and he advised her to use painkillers sparingly, Thomson said.

Von Welch, another doctor who examined Michele MacNeill before cosmetic surgery, said her husband was eager to 'get things going'.

Welch was surprised the couple rejected his advice to put off the surgery until she got her high blood pressure under control.

The MacNeills had eight children, and their oldest daughters have been outspoken in their belief that their father killed their mother.

Rachel MacNeill and Alexis Somers have gone on national TV with their claims and sat in his court hearings holding up photographs of their mother. They insist his motive was the affair.
