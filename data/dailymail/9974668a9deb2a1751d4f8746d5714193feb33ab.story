With their tiny pink noses, soft furry coats and sleepy eyes, these two clouded leopard cubs are simply adorable.

The highly endangered kittens, which are both female, were born at Zoo Miami in Florida just three weeks ago, a treat for the facility's doting keepers. 

They are currently being held in an enclosure with their mother, Serai, to 'avoid any external stress and allow the mother to properly bond with them'.

Both Serai, and the cubs' father, Rajasi, were born in 2011 in other American zoos. The newborn kittens are the parents' second successful litter.

The tiny cats, which are yet to be named, already sport the clouded leopard's characteristic large, dark and cloud-like spots on a light background.

Their birth is a victory in the fight to preserve a vulnerable species, which is not closely related to the African leopard. 

'Both offspring are doing well and the mother continues to be attentive and nurse them on a regular basis,' the zoo told AP on Monday.

Visitors should be able to view the kittens in the coming weeks.

The clouded leopard, which is medium sized, lives in forests of South East Asia. In total, fewer than 10,000 are thought to exist in the wild.

Found in the wild in southern China, Myanmar and Malaysia, adult clouded leopards typically weigh between 30 and 50 pounds (14 to 23 kilograms).

The secretive cats have a very long tail with relatively short legs and large paws.

They eat birds and mammals such as monkeys, deer and porcupines, and are, in turn, prey to human hunters who prize them for their pelts.
