Police are looking for a 7ft 3ins tall man and a woman with a tattooed face after a man's body was found dumped beside a motorway.

Gary Stretch, 47, was put on a force's most wanted list after the body of Kevin Lee, 48, was found dumped in a ditch by a major road.

Cambridgeshire police said they were also looking for Joanna Dennehy, 30, who has a distinctive green tattoo on her right cheek.

Officers said the pair were very recognisable - especially if they were together - but warned the public not to approach either of them.

The hunt comes after Kevin Lee, 48, was found stabbed to death on Saturday morning by the A16 at Newborough near Peterborough.

Detective Chief Inspector Martin Brunning said: 'Gary and Joanna are very distinctive in their appearance which is why I am asking the public for help.

'They are very recognisable - even more so if they are together.

'We are keen to hear from anyone who has information about their whereabouts or believes they may have seen them since 2pm on Good Friday.'

Stretch, of Peterborough, has grey, balding hair and police said he and Dennehy could be anywhere in the UK.

Cambridgeshire Constabulary today confirmed that Stretch and Dennehy have previous convictions, but would not disclose what they are for.

A 23-year-old man from Peterborough who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail until May 24.

Two other men, aged 32 and 36, both from Peterborough, are still being questioned.
