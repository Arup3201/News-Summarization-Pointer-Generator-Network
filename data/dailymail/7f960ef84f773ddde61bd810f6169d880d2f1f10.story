The Chelsea striker came off the bench in his side's defeat to Argentina at the weekend as the Red Devils were knocked out of the World Cup.

But Lukaku, who spent last season on loan at Everton, was taking the positives from the tournament and was already looking forward.

Asked
 whether he had spoken to anyone at Chelsea since he left to go on loan,

most ambition is and where is the best place for me to do develop as a 
young player.

‘I’m still 21 but I think I’m experienced enough. I’ve played a lot of games and scored a lot of goals, now I want to win titles and be one of the best.’
