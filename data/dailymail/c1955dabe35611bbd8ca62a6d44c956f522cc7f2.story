Frank Ribery remains a huge doubt for France ahead of the World Cup, but if he doesn't make it Samir Nasri won't be considered as a replacement.

The Bayern Munich midfielder was named in the 23-man squad to travel to Brazil on Monday but there is uncertainty as to whether he will recover from an ongoing back problem.

Remy Cabella of Montpellier - once a target for Newcastle - and Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette are likely to fight it out for the standby spot should Ribery not make it.

French woe: Coach Didier Deschamps said they would 'do everything possible' to get their talisman ready

The 31-year-old winger missed the comfortable 4-0 friendly victory over Norway at the Stade de France on Tuesday.

He was then an unused substitute during the disappointing 1-1 draw against Paraguay.

The French Football Federation are reported to have set a deadline of Friday for Ribery to prove his fitness, but are likely to give the player as long as he needs.

In theory Deschamps has up until 24 hours before the opening game against Honduras on June 15 to name a replacement.

The former Chelsea midfielder said earlier this week that they would 'do everything possible to get him ready.'

Real Sociedad winger Antoine Griezmann will be given an opportunity in Ribery's absence.

The developments might have opened the door for a sensational return from the cold for Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri, who was initially left out.

That was a decision to anger his girlfriend Anara Atanes, who caused a twitter-storm after tweeting 'F*** France and F*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager' after the news.

The coach has filed a civil law suit against the model and it remains highly unlikely that Nasri - who has been in Dubai - will be included.
