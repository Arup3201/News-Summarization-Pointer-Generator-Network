Bristol City maintained their one-point advantage over Swindon at the top of Sky Bet League One thanks to a late 1-0 home win against Crawley.

Steve Cotterill's side looked in danger of being knocked off the summit until Luke Ayling struck from close range in the 87th minute at Ashton Gate.

Swindon kept up the pressure on the pacesetters with a 3-0 triumph at Notts County, where Andy Williams bagged a brace and Massimo Luongo also scored after the Magpies had Liam Noble dismissed in the 56th minute.

Crewe remain at the foot of the table following a 2-1 loss at Scunthorpe, with Luke Williams and Miguel Angel Llera netting either side of a Nicky Ajose equaliser.

Yeovil threw the formbook out of the window when romping to a 4-0 victory at Oldham, with Stephen Arthurworrey, Simon Gillett, Sam Hoskins and Kieffer Moore doing the damage.

Rochdale were also impressive away winners as Matthew Lund, Peter Vincenti, Ian Henderson (penalty) and Jack O'Connell were on target in a 4-1 triumph at Colchester, who could only reply through Gavin Massey.

Reda Johnson and Gary Madine were on target as Coventry prevailed 2-0 at Port Vale, while Jordan Cook enjoyed a double strike either side of Tom Bradshaw's score as Walsall fought back to claim a 3-1 win over Barnsley, who had taken a 29th-minute lead through Lewin Nyatanga.
