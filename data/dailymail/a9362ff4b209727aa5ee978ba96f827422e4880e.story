Dying? The son of Fred Phelps Sr. the founder of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church has said his father is gravely ill

The founder of notorious hate group the Westboro Baptist Church is dying, according to his estranged son.

The son of Fred Phelps took to his own Facebook page early on Sunday morning to announce that his father was 'on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka.'

Nate Phelps, who left the extreme Christian sect 37-years ago wrote, 'I've learned that my father, Fred Phelps Sr., pastor of the 'God Hates Fags' Westboro Baptist Church, was ex-communicated from the 'church' back in August of 2013. He is now on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka, Kansas,' Nate Phelps posted.

'I'm not sure how I feel about this. 
Terribly ironic that his devotion to his god ends this way. Destroyed by
 the monster he made.

'I
 feel sad for all the hurt he's caused so many. I feel sad for those who
 will lose the grandfather and father they loved. And I'm bitterly angry
 that my family is blocking the family members who left from seeing him,
 and saying their good-byes.'

Phelps is being cared for in a Shawnee County facility, Westboro Baptist
 Church spokesman Steve Drain said Sunday. Drain wouldn't identify the 
facility.

'I can tell you that Fred Phelps is having some health problems,' Drain 
said. 'He's an old man and old people get health problems.' He said 
Phelps is 84.

Phelps Sr. started the Westboro Baptist Church in 1955, but before that was known as an award winning civil rights attorney.

However, he was disbarred from the Kansas Supreme Court in 1979 and lost his license to practice law in federal courts in 1989.

After
 that he became known for his crusading against gay people and his 
followers gained world-wide notoriety for picketing the funerals of US 
servicemen killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The
 church is widely known for its extreme positions against gay marriage 
and offensive demonstrations interrupting the funerals of dead 
servicemen.

In protests
 they brandish placards with phrases such as 'Thank God for IEDs, 'Fag 
soldier in hell' and 'Soldiers die 4 fag marriage'.

The small sect, which is believed to have just a few dozen members, was founded in Topeka, Kansas in 1955 by Fred Phelps.

The
 organization teaches that homosexuality is the root of all evil and 
that anyone who refuses to denounce it is the cause of all tragedies, 
including war deaths.

In 2012, half-a-million people igned petitions asking the White House to crack down on Westboro Baptist Church after the group, known for holding anti-gay demonstrations at funerals, threatened to picket in Newtown, Connecticut.

Newtown was the site of a school massacre on December 14 in which 20 young children and six adults were killed.

Five petitions posted on the White House website since the shootings have asked the government to name the church, based in Topeka, Kansas, as a hate group or end its tax-exempt status. The requests were among the most popular on the White House site on Thursday.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization, has called the church 'arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America' because of the anti-gay signs its members have carried at hundreds of military funerals.

The protests reflect their view that God is punishing America for tolerance of gays and lesbians.

The church has successfully defended its right to free speech in court.

In the past Pastor Fred Phelps and other church members have protested at hundreds of funerals of military members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of their religious view that God is punishing America for tolerance of gays and lesbians.

The church has gone to court to defend its right to protest and courts have wrestled with how to balance the group's right to free-speech against individuals' rights to privacy.

In March 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the group's funeral protests were protected speech under the First Amendment in a suit brought by Albert Snyder, the father of a Marine who had died in Iraq.

The protesters had carried signs that stated, 'God Hates You,' 'You Are Going To Hell' and 'Thank God for Dead Soldiers' at his son's funeral.
