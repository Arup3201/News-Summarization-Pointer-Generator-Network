America's favorite TV home has been revealed as the humble California apartment shared by fictional characters Sheldon, Leonard and Penny on CBS hit series The Big Bang Theory.

When it came to choosing their fictional homes, Americans opted for the modest two bedroom abode's open floor plan over Monica Geller’s iconic Manhattan apartment on the sitcom Friends, the Dunphy family's Craftsman home on ABC's Modern Family and Jerry Seinfeld's laid-black New York City apartment for the country's most beloved dream home, according to research.

'It's fascinating how people are inspired to live in the kinds of homes they see on TV, especially when you consider that in reality they are normally just television sets,' real estate agent David Guzman said of the survey. 'But layout, creative lighting and decor can add real appeal to any property.'

Mr Guzman, who is an agent at Douglas Elliman Real Estate in New York City, conducted a survey of 1,000 adults to find the top ten beloved homes in television.

While the homes from The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family and Seinfeld occupied the first three spots, Monica's apartment on Friends, The Simpsons’ family home and the Miami bachelorette pad seen on the Golden Girls were also among the spaces featured on the list. 

'My personal favorite is Frasier's apartment,' Mr Guzman said. 'I love the architectural shapes of the interior and the view of that Seattle skyline.'

According to the new research, almost a quarter or 23per cent of buyers have looked for an apartment or home that looks like their TV dream home - and one in five claimed to have bought one. 

But most Americans woefully underestimate the value of what they see on TV. 

Those surveyed estimated the worth of Highclere Castle in the United Kingdom, the real castle used as the backdrop for the PBS hit Downton Abbey at $50 million, when its real value is $240 million.

Respondents guessed the average value of Carrie's apartment in HBO's Sex and the City, which aired from 1998 to 2004, to be $1.7 million. 

In 2012, the actual apartment in New York City's West Village sold for $9.85 million.

Meanwhile, the home made famous by the Dunphys in Modern Family was estimated to be worth $1.5 million when it was actually listed in 2014 for $2.35 million.

Although TV homes are often pricier than expected, buying the perfect home is still an integral part of the American dream.

70per cent of those surveyed said they fantasize about their ideal home, and they have been dreaming about it for an average of 12 years.

Log homes, similar to the cabin owned by Sex and the City character Aidan, top the list of favorite home styles, followed by contemporary, and ranch.

Mr Guzman, who specializes in selling and buying luxury condominiums, townhouses, investment properties, multi-units and new construction developments, said they work with their clients to help them get as close to their dream home as possible.

'It may not be exact, but we can certainly show them - with research, dedication and good timing - how to find an inviting and engaging space they will be happy to call home,' he explained.  

When it comes to location, almost three-quarters of adults envisioned their fantasy home as being in the US. It also has four bedrooms and it measures a spacious 6,400 square feet.

And for some Americans, those dreams will never die; 30per cent believe they will one day live in their dream home.

And while they are waiting to achieve their goal, three artists have given them something to aspire to. 

Inaki Aliste Lizarralde, Mike Bennett and Brandi Roberts spent years drawing, in painstaking detail, the living spaces of some of the most popular US sitcoms over the course of decades.

Ms Roberts sells her sketches on her Fantasy Floorplans website for approximately $10 to $50 each, while Lizarralde's colorful renditions are available at his Etsy shop and retail between $50 and $175, allowing fans to explore every nook and cranny of their favorite spaces for a minuscule price.
