Britain's most successful football manager Sir Alex Ferguson quit at 71 because he was struggling to cope with the stress of the job, according to former England manager Fabio Capello.

Capello said that Manchester United manager Ferguson plans to travel the world with his wife Cathy, 74, when he retires.

The
fiery Scot announced earlier this week that he is to step down after more 
than 26 years in charge at the club after the game with West Brom on May
19.

Sir Alex was all smiles today as he took 
time out for preparing for his final home in charge of Manchester United
with a day out at the races at Haydock Park.

David Moyes, who will leave Everton 
and take over at Manchester United at the end of the season, also 
happened to be at the Merseyside racecourse.

The Old Trafford club is preparing 
for a double celebration tomorrow as United lift the Premier League 
trophy and bid farewell to Sir Alex on his final home game.

Capello, now in charge of the 
Russia national side, said: ‘I called him and he told me he decided this
way because of excess stress.

‘A few months ago he told me that he was going to  stay on. The news of his retirement really  surprised me.

‘I called him and he told me about the
stress. He also told me that now he’ll go and travel a bit, have fun 
and see the world with his wife.’

Former
Aberdeen boss Ferguson may start his round the world trip at his 
£2million vineyard in the south of France, which he normally visits post
season, or a penthouse apartment he owns in New York.

Sir Alex, 71 and his wife Cathy, 74, will also spend more time with their 11 grandchildren

Ferguson’s son, Peterborough manager Darren, said the family had known about the decision for some time and denied that his retirement was due to health reasons

‘He spoke to us, he felt it was the 
right time,’ said Darren.

‘We all sort of abided by that. There’s no 
problem with his health. He’s got a small hip operation but there’s no 
difference to most 71-year-olds.’

Capello and Ferguson clashed when the Italian was in charge of England, but have been long-term friends away from the game.

Capello said: ‘He was the greatest coach of all 
time, especially because of all the difficulties he overcame at the 
start of his career with United.'

‘I normally think, after four or five 
years at the most, a coach should move, so to think that he stayed on 
the same bench for 26 years is incredible. That takes psychological, 
technical and humane capacity.’

Ferguson will say his farewells to the
United fans tomorrow as he takes charge of what will be his final game at Old Trafford.

His 
players are expected to form a guard of honour while Ferguson will 
address the crowd from the centre circle after receiving the Premier 
League trophy at full-time.

Former
Red Devils stars will be part of the crowd there to wish Ferguson well 
and a selection of his favourite songs, including Frank Sinatra's My 
Way, will be played before kick off.

David Moyes was also at parade ring during the Pertemps Swinton Hurdle Day at Haydock Park Racecourse today
