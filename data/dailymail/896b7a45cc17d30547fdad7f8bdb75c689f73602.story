Luis Suarez’s countdown to the Clasico continues and all indications are that despite playing just four friendlies in four months he will be ready to start against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Since the Spanish league computer decreed that Suarez’s ban for a bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup would end the same day as football’s most expensive fixture between two of its bitterest rivals, Suarez’s focus has been on winning the race to be fit to start the match.

At first he was hampered by the demands of moving his family from Liverpool to Barcelona and by FIFA’s ban on him training with team-mates or even setting foot inside the club’s Joan Gamper headquarters.

When the ban on all football activity was lifted by the court of arbitration in sport on August 14, work could really begin on his comeback and the gruelling one-on-one training sessions with Barca fitness coach Juanjo Brau have gradually begun to pay dividends.

Off the pitch he moved his family from his wife’s parents’ house in the Barcelona coastal town of Castelldefels to a new home in nearby Gava where coach Luis Enrique and defender Javier Mascherano also live.

On the pitch a behind-closed-doors friendly with the B-team was followed by a specially organised match against an Indonesian Under-19 XI in which he scored twice and passed up on the chance to complete his hat-trick from the spot so that the B-team’s pre-designated spot-kick taker could score.

He wanted former captain Steven Gerrard to present him with the Golden Shoe this week for his 31 goals scored at Liverpool last season. When Gerrard confirmed he would not be able to make it Suarez insisted on the next best thing – Kenny Dalglish the man who brought him to Liverpool in January 2011.

He also wanted the trophy to be presented to him at Anfield but Liverpool’s next home game comes the weekend of the Clasico so the Golden Shoe will instead be handed over on Wednesday in Barcelona. The player still wants the chance to show it off in front of the Kop before the season ends.

Before the Golden Shoe presentation, he will play the second of two international friendlies in Oman on Monday. Whether for the third bite, or the signing for Barcelona — or both — his commercial value appears higher than ever.

Uruguay’s matches against Saudi Arabia and Oman have earned their football association around £1,000,000 — that is twice what they would have been paid had the player, who is banned for eight further competitive internationals, not been part of the team.

Friday’s pre-agreed 70 minute run-out was marked by all-but scoring Uruguay’s only goal in a 1-1 draw. A thunderous right-foot volley came back off the post and rebounded over the line off defender Hassan Muath Fallatah.

He looked predictably short of match sharpness but a long way from the ‘overweight ex-footballer’ description given him by the pro-Madrid media after his last friendly.

Barcelona supporters are hopeful the precedent of last season means he makes an instant impact on his return. After serving his 10-game ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic, Suarez scored twice on his league return. 

That afternoon a Sunderland side still reeling from the mismanagement of Paolo di Canio and under the temporary stewardship of Kevin Ball were the opponents, and not Real Madrid.

Another precedent lends itself to the theory that his delayed start need not be a problem. When Johan Cruyff signed for Barcelona from Ajax in August 1973 for 120m pesetas (just over £500,000) a bureaucratic problem meant the team had already played the first seven fixtures before Cruyff could play.

When he finally got to make his debut in the last week of October he scored twice against Granada in a 4-0 win.

Speaking with Spanish radio on Friday night Everton manager Roberto Martinez said he thought Suarez had the quality to fit right in to any side in any league. ‘He created Liverpool’s great season without any doubt,’ he said. ‘He will give Barcelona something they didn’t have before.’

On Wednesday in Madrid Cristiano Ronaldo, who also scored 31 league goals last season, will be awarded his Golden Shoe. Ten days later the two top marksmen will come face to face in what Jose Mourinho always referred to as the match that stops the world — it will be the man who can’t stop scoring, against the man who can’t wait to start’.
