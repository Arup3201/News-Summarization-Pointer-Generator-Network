Mother-of-three Candice Williams, 27,
suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head at her Houston home in the early hours of Thursday. The male suspect Phillip Deckard, 24, also suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head

The neighbor took all three children out of the home before calling the police. Officers found a gun and the two deceased in an upstairs bedroom. 

None of the children were injured in the tragic incident and have been placed in their grandmother's care.

The female victim who suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head was named as 27-year-old Candice Williams.

The male suspect Phillip Deckard, 24, also suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Ms Williams' friend Brittnee Phillips told Click2Houston: 'Her baby came running to my door.  I was asleep. (She was) Running to 
the door saying, ''My mama's dead, my mama's dead!'' And I didn't know 
what to do.

'I just got up and ran and
 put some clothes on and went down there.  Her body and his body were on
 the floor and the baby was in the room.'

Mother-of-three Ms Williams reportedly worked for a local charity called the Hearts With Hope foundation. 

Neighbors told KHOU

One said: 'They was a good family, she loved the kids, it didn't have to be like this.'

HPD Homicide Division authorities said: 'Following an argument at their residence, suspect Deckard shot his wife, Ms. Williams, and then himself.'
