Kai Lambe, from Hatton, Derbyshire slipped into the weir at Tutbury Mill and got into difficulty 

A nine-year-old boy drowned in a weir trying to save his friend, an inquest has heard.

Schoolboy Kai Lambe slid down a fish pass which runs over the weir when he saw a friend struggling against the current. 

But Kai, who was a weak swimmer, then found himself in trouble in the 6ft deep water and could not be saved.

Kai, from Hatton, in Derbyshire, had been playing with three friends next to the River Dove, near Tutbury, on August 22.

Although some of the boys had entered the water, investigators do not believe Kai went in until he saw his friend, Connor, was struggling.

The boys frantically tried to get to Kai, who was seen waving for help before disappearing beneath the surface. A dog walker then raised the alarm, dialling 999.

He was rescued from the water by the Staffordshire fire service and taken to Queen's Hospital in Burton where he  died.

Detective Sergeant Kerry Shaw, of Staffordshire Police, told the hearing at Burton Town Hall: 'We came to the conclusion Kai entered the water after seeing his friend getting into trouble.

'He was seen to struggle and it becomes apparent he is in danger. It is fair to say the panic among the children set in.'

Coroner Andrew Haigh concluded Kai was just a 'happy-go-lucky little lad having fun' before tragedy struck.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: 'Over the years it has been common for young people visiting this location to go swimming and indeed go down the fish pass, which has been used as a slide for generations too.

'I do accept Kai goes to do this; there is no evidence any improper force or pressure that encouraged him but I accept the circumstances are unclear.

'Kai was not a swimmer, he was described as being a very weak swimmer. The height of the water varies greatly. Where Kai was found it was at least 6ft.'

At the hearing, Derbyshire police faced criticism for the way the emergency call was dealt with, when it emerged time was wasted as the call was passed over to Staffordshire police.

When the 999 call was made by a dog walker, it was directed to the force in Derbyshire. The call handler then took the decision to hand it over to the neighbouring county as the incident took place in Staffordshire.

Coroner Andrew Haigh said officers should have been sent immediately before worrying about which force was responsible. 

He said he would be filing a report with Derbyshire Police  to avoid any similar incidents in the future.

Inspector Darren Abbott defended the call handler, saying his actions were ‘standard practice’ but agreed with Mr Haigh that officers should have been sent to the scene right away.

Mr Haigh said: 'A report comes in that a child may be drowning in an emergency situation and you are aware somebody is calling from the border, wouldn’t it be appropriate to send officers immediately?'

Inspector Abbott responded: 'In this case I agree with you.'

Villagers in Hatton were left stunned by Kai's death, with hundreds of people turning out for his funeral last month. 

St Mary's Church, in Marston on Dove, Derbyshire, could not contain the large number of people who had turned out to say goodbye and so speakers were placed outside to broadcast the service.

In a statement following the tragedy, his family said: 'Kai was a happy, outgoing and lovely little boy. We are heartbroken and devastated at the loss of our vibrant, happy, bubbly little man, Kai Joseph, 'ginge' to all who knew him.

'He was our ray of sunshine who brightened up the darkest day. We, as a family, are overwhelmed with the support of everyone in the close-knit village of Hatton and from people afar.

'He was always out and about, whether it was fishing, taking his beloved dogs for a walk with his dad or just in the village. He would smile and put his thumb up to everyone.

'He was a much-loved son of Dawn and Ali, little brother of Ellie-May and Tom, grandson, uncle, nephew, cousin and loved by many. RIP wee man.'
