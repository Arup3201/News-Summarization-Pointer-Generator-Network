Wales assistant coach Rob Howley has called on the RBS 6 Nations organisers to adopt a Premier League-style format of synchronised kick-off times on the final day of competition.

Under current broadcasting agreements, the last round of fixtures is staggered throughout the day in a bid to maximise television audiences; with Wales facing Italy in tomorrow's early tie.

With the three-way race likely to be decided by points difference, the approach gives fellow challengers Ireland and England – who are up second and third – a clearer indication of their required score-line and, according to Howley, lessens the entertainment value.

'I do really enjoy the last day of the Premier League, where everyone listens to their radios to hear the scores,' said Howley. 'The drama of that situation is unique and it would be unique in rugby - probably that should be the case in the Six Nations.

'Ultimately, in terms of all of us kicking off at the same time, there would be some drama in the game; knowing what changes need to be made and the message we need to get onto the pitch. Going up first, it's important we win the game. Ireland and England will have the opportunity after our game to know what they have to do, which is always a good thing.'

Wales need a landslide victory to overturn the points advantage of their two title rivals. They must capitalise on every attacking opportunity and, following an injury to Sergio Parisse, the chances of a significant winning margin have been given a major boost.

Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that the Italian skipper had just a '30-40 per cent' chance of being fit for the tie at the Stadio Olimpico, where it was yesterday confirmed that he will play no part because of soft tissue damage to his foot.

Howley thinks his side's opening 15 minutes against Ireland was their best display since 2008 

The much less experienced Samuela Vunisa has replaced the Azzurri No 8. He will line up against Toby Faletau but - despite being connected to Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale – the Welshman does not share Howley's view about following football's lead with fixture scheduling.

'I've not spoken to Gareth,' said Faletau. 'I'm not related to him; our girlfriends are sisters but that's about it. I watch the last couple of games in the football when it gets exciting. I would rather have it this way round, but with us playing last. It's not the case this time, but it's exciting for the players who play the first game, because they can watch the other games and wait in anticipation.'

Bale often sends messages of support for the Welsh rugby team through Twitter, while Faletau's nearest and dearest will also be keeping a close eye on how results unfold. 

If Wales go on to win the championship, it will be the first time they have claimed the title outside of Cardiff since 1971, when Barry John scored the winning points in a 9-5 victory over France at the Stade Yves-du-Manoir. But Gatland's side are building momentum and, if results over the last two years are any indication, they will be confident of ending the 34-year wait in the Italian capital.

Wales are slow starters in tournament rugby but, in 2013 and 2014, they won their final-round Tests against England and Scotland by 27 and 48 points. The famous victory over England clinched the title for Wales, but Howley believes winning this year's championship would be an even sweeter feeling than two years ago.

'It would beat that year,' said Howley. 'Losing to England at home was hugely disappointing and I think Sam Warburton hit the nail on the head. To beat Ireland third in the world was fantastic and the defence in the second half was huge. The first 15 minutes before Samson [Lee] got injured was best start we have made since 2008.'

With the race in for the title being so tight, Gatland has played down the psychological World Cup significance of finishing on top. Performances since the opening round defeat by England have given the Kiwi a settled idea of his squad but, following the long-term injury to Lee, the selection saga surrounding Adam Jones looks set to rumble on.

Adam Jones has re-iterated that he will not come out of retirement despite Samson Lee's recent injury 

The front-row - who announced his international retirement in January - has been touted as a replacement for Lee, but hit back on Thursday at claims that he needs to reverse his decision to be re-considered for selection.

'The one thing I will say is the decision wasn't premature,' Jones told TalkSport. 'I had a knock back in the summer, then the autumn, and again in the Six Nations - so it wasn't premature. Hopefully Samson will be fit because he's a great player. At the moment the door is pretty shut. I've shut it but I guess it's up to others to open it.'
