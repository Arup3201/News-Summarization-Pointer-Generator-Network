Blooming hanging baskets, immaculately trimmed lawns and perfect topiary have long been used by rural folk to show off the best of village life.

But while rivalries have always existed between neighbouring communities desperate to be crowned Britain’s Best Kept village, conservationists say increased competition for pristine parishes is brewing a far bigger wildlife scandal for the UK countryside.

They claim all untidy patches of public scrub land, which are prime habitats for insects and birds, are being cleared and made to look ‘too neat and tidy’ for the contests, whose rules afford few points to villages with scruffier areas that encourage wildlife to thrive.

A touch of colour: Britain's Best Kept Village contests are arranged by regional organisers including the Campaign to Protect Rural England, but much of the emphasis in the scoring is on things looking neat

As a consequence, environmentalists say the competitions are unwittingly contributing to the decline of some species of honey bees, butterflies and birds, which were once in abundance across Britain.

Provision for wildlife accounts for just 10 per cent of the scoring for villages entering Best Kept Village contests, with much more focus on the appearance and cleanliness of streets, flowerbeds and other public areas.

Campaigners say that, as a consequence, the strict rules are forcing parish councils to get rid of any slightly untidy areas of scrub land, including compost heaps and log piles, which are perfect breeding grounds and habitats for insects and birds.

Over-mown lawns and severely trimmed hedges, which are awarded more points, are also leading to the decline of common species, they say.

The competition is run in a number of counties in England, including Devon, Wiltshire, Lincolnshire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire and Hertfordshire. In each case it is organised by a regional group, including branches of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE).

Steve Falk, an entomologist at the conservation trust Bug Life, said Best Kept village competitions often had a ‘very old fashioned’ approach to conservation that was ‘unhelpful’ in a modern world.

He said the criteria in such contests was contradicting Government efforts to halt the decline of bees and other insects.

‘I’ve come across those sorts of villages,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph. ‘The full blown neat and tidy approach is a travesty in this day and age.

‘When you consider the Government has introduced a national pollinator strategy why would you want Best Kept Village criteria that run contrary to that?’

Fading scene: Butterfly species are in decline

But he admitted that conservationists needed to ‘strike a balance’ with organisers.

‘We aren’t purists,’ Mr Falk said. ‘I think most conservation organisations would say there is a lot to be said for presenting wildlife habitats nicely. Rotting material doesn’t need to be visible at all. You can have it in nooks and crannies.’

Half of all bumblebee species in the UK are in long term decline and seven bumblebee species have fallen in number by more than 50 per cent in the last 25 years.

Butterflies are another species also on the decline as a consequence of the destruction or poor management of their habitats, Liam Creedon, a spokesman for the Butterfly Conservation charity, said.

According to the most recent figures, from 2011, three quarters of British butterfly species decreased in abundance over the previous decade.

Both bees and butterflies are vital for pollinating crops – £12.6billion worth of crops (or 84 per cent of the European Union total) rely on such insects.

‘Many familiar butterflies are now far less abundant than they were, raising concerns for the health of our environment,’ Mr Creedon added.

‘Caterpillars also love patches of untidy, unkempt undergrowth with long grasses and other wild plants.’

Diana Moyse, who judges the Best Kept Village competition for the CPRE in Devon CPRE, admitted that, while wildlife provision is taken into account by some, it ought to be better reflected in the formal competition criteria.

‘I think things can be tweaked,’ she said. ‘I wouldn’t be averse to within Devon making it more explicit because I think it is a big issue.’

She said the results for this year’s contest in the county were due to be announced this week.
