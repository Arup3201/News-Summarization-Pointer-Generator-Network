It's amazing what one inventive singer can create using nothing but his voice, a microphone and some nifty layering software.

Vocal artist Nick McKaig, 23, of Tallahassee, Florida, has produced an outrageously good version of The Simpsons theme tune sung a cappella.

He separately recorded 30 different voices to make up the famous song and his YouTube video has already attracted more than 100,000 views.
