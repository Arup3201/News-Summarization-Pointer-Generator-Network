Self-harm in indigenous Australians has increased almost 50 per cent in the past 10 years while juveniles are 24 times more likely to be sentenced to detention than their non-indigenous counterparts, according to a new government report.

These were some of the findings in the Productivity Commission's Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage 2014 report released on Wednesday.

The report spanned 600 pages and also found there had been a 57 per cent increase in the amount of adult indigenous Australians sent to prison between 2000 and 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

It was also revealed Aboriginals were over-represented in the criminal justice system as victims and offenders.

But the report also brought good news, with more young people completing high school and getting a qualification.

In 2012, 59 per cent of indigenous youths graduated Year 12 and 43 per cent went on to complete a tertiary education.

It was also found Aboriginals were living longer, the infant mortality rate was lower, smoking had decreased and employment had risen to 48 per cent - meaning less reliance on government handouts.

Between 2007 and 2012, the life expectancy of an indigenous male increased 0.8 of a year while a female's had risen by 0.1 years.

Since 2008, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) have vowed to 'close the gap' across six different areas, which covers life expectancy, mortality rates of children, education and employment.

The report serves as a feedback tool for governments to see if their policies for indigenous Australians are improving their quality of life.

Productivity Commissioner Patricia Scott told Fairfax Media the report demonstrated how essential it was to take a grassroots approach when coming up with policies as well as continuing to invest money in programs that had clear targets. 

'There's a lot to be said here for holding governments to account,' Ms Scott said.

'We'd like to think there would be people who would turn around to the government and say "Well done in this area, but what's the story here?"'
