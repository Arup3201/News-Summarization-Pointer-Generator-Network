The price of marijuana and the fate of the Astrodome hangs in the balance today as they are two of the various state-wide measures that are listed on local ballots.

In addition to gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and the well-publicized mayoral race in New York City, a number of states have regional issues that they are asking residents to vote on.

LIGHTING UP: MAINE PUSHES FOR LEGAL POT AND COLORADO WANTS 'WEED TAX'

Legalizing marijuana was a controversial ballot measure in the 2012 election for residents of Colorado and now Maine is following suit by having a vote on the use of small recreational amounts of the drug.

Colorado has brought the issue up again, but this time lawmakers have proposed a 25 per cent tax on the drug.

The money from the proposed tax will go to school construction but opponents see the tax as a threat that will drive up black market sales.

Reaping the benefits: Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012 and now they are pushing a measure to tax it by 25 per cent. Maine also has a ballot measure that could legalize recreational marijuana in that state

SELLING BEER UP FOR DEBATE IN ONE OF UTAH'S LAST DRY CITIES

Utah is dealing with their own controversial move as there is a measure to sell beer in the town of Hyde Park.

It is one of the largely-Mormon state's remaining dry cities, as so many of the religious residents observe Mormon law which bans the consumption of alcohol and caffeine.

GAMBLING ON THE VOTE: PROPOSED CASINO CONSTRUCTION

Other wild pursuits may be coming to New York and Massachusetts where voters will decide if they're feeling lucky enough to allow the construction of casinos.

There are two proposed casinos that may or may not be built in Massachusetts while New York has seven that Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo has backed in an effort to the upstate economy.

PAY RAISE: DEBATE OVER MINIMUM WAGE IN WASHINGTON AND NEW JERSEY

Residents of Washington state and New Jersey are dealing with their own economic changes, as New Jersey is voting on a $1 increase to the hourly rate which would make it $8.25.

Washington's increase is much more dramatic as they already have the highest rate in the country at $9.19 an hour. Today's ballot proposal is pushing for the minimum wage at the Seattle airport and the surrounding hotels will be paid $15 an hour.

PAVING PARADISE: THE 'EIGHTH WONDER' MAY BE DEMOLISHED OVER DEBTS

Money
troubles are causing problems for Houston residents, and they are being
asked whether or not they should demolish the city's iconic former 
football and baseball stadium.

It hasn't been the home field for any sports team since 1999 and has accrued $217million in bonds over the years.
