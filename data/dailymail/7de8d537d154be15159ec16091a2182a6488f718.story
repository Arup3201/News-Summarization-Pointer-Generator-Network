Their goal lies across the water, on the shores of Dover, where they believe they will finally be able to leave their experiences of their war-torn homes behind.

They have pitched their tents close to the shore after long and troublesome journeys from countries such as Syria, Iraq and Somalia, to seek asylum in the UK.

Hundreds of refugees are camping out in Calais, France, awaiting the next opportunity to cross the English Channel.

Shoreline: An encampment of makeshift tents near the Calais ferry port, home to migrants of mainly Afghan origin awaiting an opportunity to cross

Hours of wait: Migrants queue to receive their daily supply of a hot meal provided by volunteers working for the charity 'SALAM' in Calais, France

Towards new horizons: The number of refugees arriving has not lessened with recent destruction of refugee camps in Calais, and Syrian migrants are increasing by the day, according to volunteers

Tricked: Many of the campers, mainly men hoping to be able to provide for their families from their new country, have been given false hope by human trafficker of the ease with which they would cross the border into Britain

Unlike France, the UK pays benefits to
asylum seekers while their claim is being processed, a glimmer of hope 
for the 1,000 or so who are camping in squalid conditions near the Calais ferry port.

The lucky ones sleep in tents on the grassy slopes near the terminal or on disused rail tracks close by.

Others, less fortunate have to make do with leftover tarpaulin tied between sticks and held down with mud and rocks.

Many
have travelled for weeks, tricked by human traffickers that their final
destination would be easy to reach and that they would be taken 
straight to the UK.

As they 
discover that crossing the channel is harder than they thought, with 
local authorities constantly attempting to evict them and with no ferry 
prepared to take them, they huddle around the daily charity meal, 
planning their next move.

Long journey: A Syrian migrant displays a picture on his mobile phone of a packed fishing boat, on which he traveled illegally from Greece to Italy

Time of need: Mohammed, a Syrian migrant, rests in his tent underneath blankets donated by a local charity

Squalor: Some do not even have a tent, but sleep under tarpaulin held up by sticks, such as this Afghan man, attempting to keep warm with donated blankets

Close to the action: The little camps tend to be split by nationality and are dotted around the ferry terminal by the English Channel

Longing for Britain: The migrants in the camp have no desire to stay in France, but see Calais as a short stop on their way to their final destination - the UK

The
migrants are mostly young men from countries including Afghanistan, 
Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, and Somalia, with a noticeable increase in Syrian 
refugees in the past year.

The
latter group, in particular, has caused upset in the area, as France 
has offered to take in Syrian asylum seekers, yet many of these men wish
for a future in the UK due to their treatment.

In
an open letter to MEP's earlier this month, the Syrian refugees in 
Calais addressed the situation, drawing attention to the horrid 
conditions they face on the European continent.

‘We
want to draw your kind attention to the bad situation that the Syrians 
are facing in some parts of Europe especially in France and Italy,’ the 
open letter reads.

Chilling nights: Afghan and Pakistani migrants huddle together for warmth as the late October weather grip the French coastline

Temporary home: Migrants camp in makeshift tents near to the Calais ferry port in France. Thousands of migrants have set up temporary home in the area

First in line: Migrants race to accept the offer of a daily free hot meal supplied by a charity set up after the French Government closed down the Sangatte refugee centre

Helping hand: Migrants eat their daily supply of a hot meal provided by volunteers working for the charity 'SALAM' on Tuesday night

Diverse: The migrants have a broad range of nationalities, from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Kurdistan, Iraq, Eritrea, Sudan, Palestine, and Somalia

Dishing up: The volunteers distribute the food among asylum seekers from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan

Grim: After their food, the migrants fill up their water bottles

Back to camp: Three lone tents set up in a public park offer shelter to the asylum seekers

'For 
example, in Calais, France, we are sleeping outside and have no food or 
shelter to protect us from the winter cold just because we have chosen 
to go and live in England. In other hand, in Italy the police take our 
prints by force to prevent us to go anywhere else.

They
urged MEP’s to act swiftly on their situation in Calais as ‘our 
families are living in a bad situation and we need to go to England as 
fast as possible to work and send them money.'

Earlier
this month, Philippe Wannesson, from a group working with refugees in 
Calais, said a growing number of Syrians were arriving in the town 
wanting to reach the UK.

‘A year ago we saw perhaps only two, three or four,’ he said.

‘Since March or April it has been rising to 20, 30, 40 and steadily growing.’

Road to Britain: Graffiti purporting to direct migrants to the border is scrawled across a Calais road sign

Desperate: Migrants walk on railway tracks beside their makeshift campsite close to the ferry terminal

Daily wait: Thanks to charity 'SALAM'. formed in 2002 following the French Government's closure of the Red Cross centre in Sangatte, the migrants of Calais get a hot meal a day

Life on the tracks: A group of male migrants, believed to be Syrian, attempt to build a barbecue from disused oil drums on the rail tracks by the ferry terminal

Scattered lives: The main goal of the migrants camping in Calais is to get in to Britain and many are not prepared for the struggle to get across the channel

Denis
Robin, the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, said the Syrians had a 
‘95 per cent chance of success’ if they applied for asylum in France.

The United Nations refugee agency said France has offered to take in 10,000 Syrians.

Calais
mayor Natacha Bouchart has described the number of migrants trying to 
make it across the Channel as 'untenable', blaming the UK benefits 
system for creating 'a plague' of camps which are 'tarnishing the town's
image'.

She has previously 
blamed Britain's 'enormous' state hand-outs for luring migrants to her 
town and using it as a staging area hoping to be granted leave to get 
across the 26 mile or so stretch of water that separates us and France.

Earlier this month, several hundred migrants from Syria occupied the ferry terminal at Calais.

They demanded to be granted passage to the UK after claiming they were treated 'like dogs' by the French authorities.
