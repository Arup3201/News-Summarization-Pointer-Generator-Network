In their 19th-century heydays they had fizzed with life, powered by a mining boom and seemingly endless profits.

But less than 100 years later the sun-scorched towns of Humberstone and nearby Santa Laura in Chile's Atacama desert lay abandoned, the ghost towns of a different age.

Humberstone was established in 1862 
and became the epicentre of Chile saltpeter, or sodium nitrate. This 'white 
gold' was used in explosives and later, fertilisers, transforming 
farming practices in America and Europe.

The material was in demand for more 
than 50 years from the 1860s and northern Chile became the largest 
supplier of natural saltpeter in the world. 200 plants sprang up to mine
and process the nitrate as a result.

Ghost town: Established in 1862, Humberstone in northern Chile was the epicentre of saltpeter, or sodium nitrate, mining. But after the value of the material dropped, Humberstone's plants were closed down and its houses abandoned

Abandoned: A burst coffin containing human bones lies in the arid ground in Humberstone. The old town lies in Chile's Atacama desert, the driest on Earth

Eerie: Crosses mark out graves in the cemetery of old mining town Pisagua about 118 miles north of Iquique. After its 19th-century heyday the town became a prison camp during the Pinochet regime where hundreds of political prisoners were brought to be tortured

Towns like Humberstone and Santa Laura evolved around the plants, luring thousands of people to the driest desert on Earth.

In the 1940s, 3,700 people lived in Humberstone. They enjoyed watching Mexican films and Spanish operettas - or zarzuelas - in the municipal theatre. Now the building is a wreck, its once plush red velvet chairs in tatters from neglect.

Their are stories of ghosts: children's screams echoing in the buildings and apparitions appearing in photographs.

A mile down the road, Santa Laura, established in 1872, was a smaller plant with 450 families during the booming 1920s.

But by the 1930s, a synthetic nitrate, developed in Europe, more or less wiped out the bustling industry. Production fell to 10 per cent in Humberstone and by the 1950s it had nosedived to just 3 per cent.

Past joys: Humberstone's 3,700 inhabitants enjoyed watching Mexican films and Spanish operettas in the municipal theatre, now a wreck

By 1959 the town's mines and plants had closed. Its workers left to find new jobs.

The once thriving town became desolate, while people's abandoned possessions lay decaying: Dresses, shoes and fichas - tokens used instead of cash - are still gathering dust today.

Humberstone was declared a national monument by the Chilean government in 1970 and became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2005. However, after years of earthquakes and vandalism, the town is now on the List of World 
Heritage in Danger.

Similarly, Santa Laura closed in 
1958. Rusty machinery and a narrow-gauge railway, once used to transport
the 'white gold' to the coast, remain the only remnants of a golden 
age.

More sinister still is Pisagua - or to use the literal Spanish translation 'p**swater' on account of the water contaminated with nitric acid  - a coastal town 118 miles north of Iquique.

Going nowhere: An old train stands abandoned on rusty tracks in Humberstone. The town was declared a national monument by the Chilean government in 1970 and became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2005

Decline: By the 1930s, a synthetic nitrate, developed in Europe, more or less wiped out the bustling industry. Production fell to 10 per cent in Humberstone and by the 1950s it nosedived to just 3 per cent

Remnants: Rusty machinery, buildings and a narrow-gauge railway, once used to transport the 'white gold' to the coast, remain the only remnants of a golden age in both Santa Laura and Humberstone

Spooky: This room in a Santa Laura house looks virtually untouched

It had been a busy port for the mining companies, but after the value of saltpeter fell, the town became a prison camp during the Pinochet regime. Hundreds of political prisoners were brought to Pisagua to be tortured.

In 1990, 20 bodies were exhumed from an unmarked grave in the town's cemetery following the Rettig investigation into the dictatorship. The corpses, which had been wrapped in cloth and bound with wire, showed obvious signs of torture. All had bullet holes, some still wore blindfolds and had their hands tied together. Two were mutilated, one beheaded.

Now Pisagua's some 250 residents, scratching a living harvesting algae and shellfish, must live with the ghosts of their town's past, while Humberstone and Santa Laura continue to crumble.
