A man whose nose was sliced off by a meat cleaver in a street fight which left his rapper friend dying has given evidence at the trial of four men accused of the murder.

Shajidur Rahman, 20, was left permanently disfigured with deep scars to his face and head in the attack which killed 19-year-old Isaac Stone.

The aspiring rapper was allegedly chased and trapped during the fight, before he was punched repeatedly, kicked and stabbed several times, with a wound which penetrated his left lung proving fatal.

Scarred: Shajidur Rahman's nose was sliced off with a meat cleaver in a fight in which the 20-year-old's friend Isaac Stone, 19, was fatally stabbed

Attack: Mr Rahman said he tried to defend himself but after the second or third blows he felt 'dizzy'. He said that he was hit a total five or six times before he ran off

Giving evidence at Luton Crown Court, Mr Rahman said he thought the scuffle would be a 'fist fight', and was shocked when he spotted one of the defendants, Fahim Khan, 20, armed with a weapon.

Khan, Mohammed Hussain, 22, 19-year-old Rubel Miah and his 21-year-old brother Javed Miah all deny murder and attempted murder, as well as two counts of possession of an offensive weapon. 

Vincent Coughlin QC, prosecuting, told the court that the 'murderous attack' had taken place in Bedford on the evening of Saturday, January 25 this year - the day after a music video starring Mr Stone, who performed under the name Dynamikk, had been posted on YouTube.

The video, entitled Go Missing, also featured a number of the rappers friends, including Mr Rahman, had been made by a media studies student.

Victim: Isaac Stone, 19, was punched, kicked and stabbed several times, the court was told, with a wound to his left lung proving fatal

In the course of the film, alcohol was seen being sprayed over a graffiti tag 'Riz', which was painted onto a wall. 'It upset someone,' said the prosecutor.

Giving evidence, Mr Rahmah said he had seen two defendants, Rubel Miah and Khan, earlier that night in an alleyway Bedford. He said they told him they had not got a problem with him, but had a issue with Mr Stone and another youth.

Earlier in the trial, the jury was told that some of the four defendants, who are all from Bedford, had paid £150 to hire a white Range Rover 'perhaps for show', before buying two meat cleavers for £2.99 each from a hardware shop.

Mr Rahman said that later, he was in a Corsa driven by Mr Stone when they saw the hired Range Rover that Rubel Miah and Khan had got into.

'Everyone froze,' he told the court. 

'We said "we have got to sort it". We never anticipated it would lead to what happened.

'It happened so quick. We stopped. We did not think weapons were involved. We thought it was a fist fight.

'Issac said "They have got something in their hands".'

Mr Rahman said that as he and Mr Stone got out of their car, Rubel Miah and Khan came towards them. 

'Fahim came up to me,' he said. 

'I thought he had a hammer. It had a blue wrapping over the handle. I got hit by Fahim. I didn’t know at the time that it was a meat cleaver.'

Mr Rahman said he tried to defend himself but after the second or third blows he felt 'dizzy'. He said that he was hit a total five or six times before he ran off.

Evidence: Luton Crown Court was told that Mr Rahman had suffered four deep cuts to his face, and his nose was effectively sliced off

The court was told he had suffered four deep cuts to his face, and his nose was effectively sliced off, with the cut off part left at the scene.

As he escaped he said he saw four or five shapes on his left and that he now realised one of them was Mr Stone. He said he was unable to get a taxi to hospital, but called a friend who took him.

Following their arrest, three of the defendants made no comment when questioned by detectives, while Khan said he was not responsible for the injuries and was acting in self defence.

The trial continues.
