A woman Labour MP locked herself in a Commons lavatory and another MP claimed he had pebbles in his shoes – to help a bid by their party to force through tough new press curbs.

West Ham MP Lyn Brown had to be summoned by a sword-wearing official – who knocked on the door of the loo and asked her to come out.

Labour had been in danger of running out of time to table amendments to tomorrow’s Commons vote on state regulation of the press.

Under Commons rules, the amendments need to be tabled when the House is sitting. But with just one minute to go before the Commons rose on Thursday, and with no sitting on Friday, Labour  realised they might be too late.

With seconds to go before time ran out, Labour used an obscure Parliamentary timewasting device to force a vote on whether MPs should continue the Thursday sitting behind closed doors.

As parliamentary sittings include the time it takes to vote, and each vote takes about 15 minutes, forcing the vote was designed to buy Labour vital extra minutes to table their Leveson amendments.

The delay by Mrs Brown prevented Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans from declaring the vote completed and Labour officials had more time to put the finishing touches to their Leveson plan.

Assistant Serjeant at Arms Bob Twigger, who carries a ceremonial sword, marched into the ‘Aye’ voting lobby, knocked on the door and demanded to know who was inside. Ms Brown was eventually persuaded to open the door and leave.

But at this point, there was another delay when Labour MP Thomas Docherty claimed he had  a pebble in his shoe and took it off. Then he said he had a pebble in his other shoe.

Ironically, fellow Labour MP Paul Flynn raised a point of order with Mr Evans to query why the vote was ‘taking an excessively long time’ and asked: ‘Are people playing games?’

One Conservative MP said: ‘Lyn Brown did not look ill to me. It was an outrageous abuse of Parliament.’
