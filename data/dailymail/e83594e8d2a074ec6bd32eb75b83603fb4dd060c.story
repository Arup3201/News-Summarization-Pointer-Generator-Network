A 23-year-old Fairefield, Ohio resident was shot and killed on Saturday by a police officer called to regulate a fight between the 23-year-old and his father.

Authorities say that the father and son scuffle started when Caleb Surface broke into his father Jeff Surface's house at the 2000 block of Spyglass Hill Court a little before 8pm. The pair began fighting physically and that's when Jeff called the police.

WCPO reported that When police arrived, Caleb Surface ran out the back door and an officer met up with Caleb close by at the  2000 block of Saint Andrews Court.

Caleb was shot by a police officer on Saturday just a week after he turned 23 years old

Caleb broke into his father's house at the 2000 block of Spyglass Hill Court just a little before 8 p.m.

According to police, that's where an officer, whose name has not been released, fired two shots.

Caleb died at the scene--exactly one week after his 23rd birthday on January 11.

Surfaces body wasn't carried away from the scene by the Butler County Coroner's Office until 4:30 a.m., nine hours after the father called 911.

Fairfied officer Doug Day said that Caleb Surface did not fire a shot at officer and is unsure as to what pushed his fellow officer to shoot the young man.

It's unclear as to whether Caleb was armed or not but officer Day said that pointing a gun at an officer is enough to warrant shooting back.

'You display a weapon, you refuse our commands, you tell us you have a weapon, you make a furtive movement that makes us believe you're pulling a weapon at us, we will likely fire shots,' he said.

WCPO reports that both Surface's father and his cousin Ed Kathman both believe that their son was unarmed the evening of the shooting.

'To the best of his father's knowledge, his son was unarmed, and that's what he told police,' Kathman said.

He also said Surface 'didn’t take any weapons out of the house.'

Surface's family say that he was 'a good kid' but that he struggled with drug addiction and was emotionally troubled.

Status updates on Surface's facebook page indicate that he was struggling emotionally with feeling of helplessness and boredom.

'Some one save me from me please I just wanna blow my heqdnoff so bored!' wrote Caleb on January 16.

He also wrote, 'What glimmers is sure to fade.'

On the actual day of the shooting on January 18. Caleb wrote a prophetic poost reading, 'last words?'

Calebs friends and family say he was 'kind hearted' but that he struggled with drug addiction and depression

Even though Caleb wrote this on his facebook page he was believed to be unarmed during the time of the shooting

He even wrote, 'beer and a gun hmmm what to do.'

Whether or not Caleb was armed is still not public knowledge.

The immediate family said they will not comment on the shooting until the investigation is complete.

'The family expects a full and accurate accounting of what transpired from the time that Caleb left his father's home until his death a short time later,' the family's lawyer said.

Caleb's cousin Ed Kathman said, 'It’s just an ongoing struggle with chemical dependency,' Kathman said. 'He was a good kid. He just struggled with drugs.'

'He was a good kid with a huge heart,' said Angie Kelley, Surface’s 
aunt. 'He struggled with depression and he was unhappy. Life hasn’t been
 easy on him lately,' she told the Dayton Daily News.

The family has said that Caleb was 'kind hearted' and that his drug addiction overcame him.

'Will I sleep tonight that is the question,' Caleb wrote on his facebook on January 16 in an eerie foreshadowing.

He turned 23 just a week before his death and seemed to be at a all time low. 'Drinking byyourself on your bday really isn't all that ,believe it or not'

The police department is investigating the shooting and the officer who shot the boy, a 10-year veteran of the department, has been put on administrative leave while the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations and the Fairfield Police Department investigate.
