Charlotte Smith was bludgeoned to death after she asked her husband for a divorce, a court heard

A spurned husband killed his wife by battering her with an ornamental elephant, a court heard.

Devendra Singh used the wooden figure to attack Charlotte Smith with 'extreme force and extreme violence' after the 42-year-old told him she wanted a divorce, the jury was told.

Philip Bennetts QC, prosecuting, said Miss Smith's skull was repeatedly 'smashed and shattered' in the attack last September.

He described the level of violence used against her as 'off the scale'.

Singh, 33, admits killing his wife – who worked as a health and safety  manager – but denies murder, claiming he suffered a 'loss of control'. The court heard he beat his wife of two years with the 4lb wooden object after an argument at their home in Leek, Staffordshire.

Mr Bennetts said: 'Many of the blows were delivered with a heavy implement – an ornamental elephant which the defendant picked up and used to strike her repeatedly to the face and head.'

Miss Smith was said to have died as a result of 'sustained and extreme blunt force trauma'.

Mr Bennetts added: 'Bone was smashed and shattered time and time again.

'The amount of force used was effectively off the scale. It was beyond severe – it was extreme.'  Following the attack, Singh is accused of leaving his wife's body on their living room floor and leaving the house, taking her mobile phone SIM card with him.

It was alleged that he cleaned up and threw evidence – including  the wooden elephant – over the garden fence into a field, before fleeing to London.

He is said to have put Miss Smith's SIM into his own phone and sent texts to her family and friends – including her father, Peter Smith – pretending to be her.

Stafford Crown Court heard Mr Smith discovered his daughter's body on the floor of her living room three days later. Singh returned to Leek that same day and handed himself in to police.

Mr Smith, 65, told how his daughter and son-in-law had lunch at  his home just a day before Miss Smith was killed.

Giving evidence on the first day of 
the trial on Tuesday, Mr Smith said: 'We had a really great time. We 
were talking about holidays and parties. When they left everything was 
OK.

'We were planning to go on holiday to Goa in November.'

Miss Smith met Singh during a previous holiday in the Indian state with her father in 2008.

They began a relationship and married in Goa in December 2010, and after waiting for a visa, Singh moved to the UK.

The court heard the Smith family opened a town centre shop for  him to run when he could not  find work.

But prosecutors said by last summer the relationship was failing, and Singh had become prone to heavy drinking and aggression.

Mr Smith said: 'Charlotte wasn't happy
in the situation. She said she was finding it difficult living with 
someone. I saw the end was coming.'

Singh told police Miss Smith had been 
violent towards him and that she had picked up a knife during the 
argument, the court heard.

But Mr Bennetts said: 'Even if you 
accept that happened, the prosecution case is that none of that could 
ever begin to justify what he did to her that day.'

Miss Smith, who was known as Charlie, 
told work colleagues Singh had grabbed her around the neck during an 
argument four months before she died.

Craig Ferns, who worked with her at 
Leek-based chemical manufacturer Polynt UK, said of the incident in May 
last year: 'She told me at one point he had hold of her around the neck.

'I do not know how she stopped him holding her neck but she rang her father to come round and defuse the situation.'

Damien Pearson, deputy site manager at the company, said Miss Smith had told him she was fed up with Singh.

'She told me he changed when he had been drinking and was not a particularly nice person,' he said.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
