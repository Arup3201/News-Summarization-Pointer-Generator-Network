Car insurance renewal can be stressful at the best of times with the fear of rising cost.

Spare a thought then for Rhys Barker who was quoted £1.2million for his £1,400 Vauxhall Corsa.

The 27-year-old contacted Zenith to make sure the figure was correct and they helpfully offered him the opportunity of paying it in instalments of £104,000 a month.

Overpriced: Rhys Barker, 27, was offered a quote of £1.2million to insure his £1,400 Vauxhall Corsa

A screengrab shows the massive quote Mr Barker was given by Zenith when he tried to insure his car online

Mr Barker, who lives in the Salford Quays area of Manchester, said: 'I went through all the questions and then the quote came up for £1,165,977.75. I was convinced it must be a mistake, so I called them up on their helpline.

'They didn’t even seem to be shocked by it. They checked it for me and then said it was right.'

He was even more shocked that they suggested he could pay in instalments if he could not afford the total upfront - with a first payment of £233,000 followed by 10 months at £104,000 per month.

He said: 'I’m convinced they were just trying to price me out of buying insurance with them but it’s a ridiculous way of doing it. I’d love to know how they would have reacted if I’d just agreed to it - although with a car worth less than £1,500 it was never going to be likely.'

Mr Barker, a project analyst for Manchester United, passed his test two years ago and had been paying £2,000 to insure a Ford Fiesta before he bought the second-hand Corsa. He has a clean record with no accidents and no convictions.

He claimed his quote was just one example of how young and new drivers are treated poorly by insurance firms.

He added: 'I’ve got one of the cheapest cars you can get but the criteria for insurance is crazy. If I change a search from living alone to co-habiting, it goes down by £200.'

He says postcode-based quotes are also unfair.

'I’m classed as Salford because of the first three figures - why don’t they look at the whole postcode? The way they assess risk makes no sense at all.'

Unfair: Despite Mr Barker's car being one of the cheapest on the market, he was quoted extortionate insurance prices

Mr Barker is now insured with Bell, which is owned by Admiral, and pays around £,2000. He has a Telematics box - a black box which records how he drives to lower insurance rates.

He added: 'That’s not fair either really because when you go over a speed bump it counts against you, and if you have to stop suddenly because someone steps into the road it does too.'

Gary Humphreys, group underwriting director at Markerstudy Group, which runs Zenith, said: 'The price Mr Barker was quoted reflects that we have ‘declined’ to provide cover, as we would not expect a customer to pay such a high premium.

'This is not a case of pricing customers out of the market but quoting on the risks that are within our rating parameters and declining if they are outside.

'Without the detail we are unable to tell why Zenith was unable to provide cover at the time. We are aware this website has changed the way it quotes since Mr Barker used it, so that if a quote is over £10,000 it ‘declines’ rather than quotes a high premium.'

A spokesman from Admiral Group plc said its premium is based on statistics. He said quotes change because of factors like marital status or postcode because they reflect the risk taken on by an insurance company.
