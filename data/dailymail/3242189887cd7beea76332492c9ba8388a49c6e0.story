As they walked into court yesterday, the casually dressed pair looked more like students en route to a lecture than two international drug smugglers.

The armed police and handcuffs on their wrists told a different story.

Minutes later, Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly were sentenced to six years and eight months in jail for attempting to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru.

Security: Some 24lbs of cocaine worth £1.5million was found in Reid's (pictured) and McCollum's luggage

The women were arrested four months 
ago at Lima airport with 11kg of the Class A drug in their suitcases as 
they tried to check-in for a flight to Spain.

Their families believed they were in Ibiza at the time, working in bars.

Yesterday
 they learned they had escaped the most severe 15-year penalty in return
 for pleading guilty and passing on information about the gang that 
supplied the drugs. 

The Mail understands they could now be released within two-and-a-half years for good behaviour. Taking into account the time already served, it means they could be freed in early 2016.

Dressed in jeans and a blue T-shirt, Reid, 20, from Glasgow, looked glum as she was led into court clutching two bananas.

Perhaps
 seeking belated advice on life, McCollum Connolly, 20, from Dungannon, 
Northern Ireland, held a book entitled: Secrets About Life Every Woman 
Should Know: Ten Principles for Spiritual and Emotional Fulfilment.

Reading: As McCollum entered court she was carrying a book published in 2009 by Barbara De Angelis called 'Secrets About Life Every Woman Should Know: Ten principles for spiritual and emotional fulfilment'

Departing: McCollum (left) and Reid (right) leave the court after being jailed for six years and eight months

Leaving: A judge read out the sentence at the end of the 20-minute hearing, closed to the press and public

The
 book claims that by embracing ten simple rules, ‘you can transform any 
situation or event – no matter how difficult or challenging – into 
something that can enrich you’.

McCollum
 Connolly’s familiar hairstyle – an oversized bun – was replaced by a 
more relaxed look, and teamed with a simple green khaki top with black 
jeans.

Secrets About Life Every Woman Should Know is a guide by Barbara De Angelis that is said to reveal how to turn difficult and challenging events into something that can 'enrich you'.

The 62-year-old US relationships author's book reveals 10 steps to help people 'always remain calm and clear' and have a reliable 'source of confidence and wisdom inside yourself'.

A review in US trade magazine Publishers Weekly said it contains 'a watered-down version of Eastern philosophy aimed at teaching her readers about the purpose of life'.

Despite the 
notoriously difficult conditions at Virgen de Fatima jail in Peru’s 
capital city, she sported a French manicure,  while Reid wore pink nail
 polish with a ‘nail art’ pattern.

The
 pair, nicknamed the ‘Peru Two’, were led into a makeshift courtroom at 
Lima Men’s Prison in Sarita Colonia, at about 10.30am local time.

Judge
 Pedro Miguel Puente Bardales read out the sentence at the end of the 
20-minute hearing, which was closed to the press and public. The pair 
will now apply to serve part of their sentence in the UK.

But
 according to their lawyers, the process is fraught with ‘bureaucratic 
hurdles’ and they could be released before it is granted.

A
 court spokesman said: ‘Michaella and Melissa only spoke to say they 
agreed with the sentence and ask through a translator if they could 
serve out their sentences in Britain. It was explained to them that this
 was something they had to discuss with their lawyer.

Courts process: Reid (centre) and McCollum (left) arrive for a hearing with a judge in Callao on September 24

Charges: Connolly (left) and Reid (centre) listen to a translator at an earlier court hearing in Callao in August

Questioning: The duo were detained on August 6 at Lima Airport on suspicion of trying to smuggle cocaine

Evidence: Food packages allegedly containing cocaine which were found in the luggage of Connolly and Reid

Destination: Because McCollum (left and right) and Reid have been given a sentence of seven years or less, they are eligible to apply for transfer to Britain - although this must be agreed by both governments

‘They have renounced their right to appeal by agreeing to the sentence.’

The pair were then returned to prison, and the cell they share with as many as 40 other women.

The Peru Two have been sent to the Santa Monica prison in Chorrillo to begin their sentence, which will last until April 2020.

The jail - which is notorious for its crowded and unsanitary conditions - has housed most foreign women prisoners in the past.

The prison was built for 250 women but now houses more than 1,000 in filthy conditions in which HIV and tuberculosis are rife.

A report in 2002 by the US Department of State said inmates in Peru's prisons often lacked access to potable water, adequate bathing facilities and hygienic kitchen facilities.

The
 womens’ Peruvian lawyer Meyer Fishman last night described the sentence
 as the ‘least worst option’ and said they would ‘in theory’ qualify for
 early release.

But he said: ‘There are judges that say “yes” and there are judges that say “no”.’

Following their arrest on August 6, the pair claimed they had been kidnapped by an armed gang and flown to Peru.

The
 women, who did not know each other beforehand, claim they were 
unwittingly introduced by friends to drugs runners, who threatened their
 families if they did not agree to smuggle cocaine.

Their
 story was described as ‘illogical’ and they later pleaded guilty to 
drug trafficking, but claimed they were doing so to secure a more 
lenient sentence.

Reid’s 
mother, National Grid administrator Debra, 53, said in September that 
her daughter was ‘definitely’  carrying drugs but still believed she was
 coerced.
