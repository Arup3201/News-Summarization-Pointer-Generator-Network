Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford wants his riders to cement their place as 'indisputably the best cycling team in the world' by 2020.

When Team Sky launched in 2009, Brailsford vowed to produce a British Tour de France winner and he succeeded, as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome triumphed in 2012 and 2013.

Brailsford is now looking to the next five years and, despite the team notching 165 victories overall since its foundation, he is adamant things can get even better.

Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford insists that his riders have what it takes to be the best in the world by 2020

'Where we want to be in 2020 is very simple - we want Team Sky to be indisputably the best cycling team in the world, and to be viewed as one of the very best sports teams in the world,' Brailsford told Press Association Sport.

'We had a clear vision for our first five years - we wanted to win the Tour de France and we wanted to get a million people cycling. We did both. In fact we did it twice with the Tour de France.

'It was a terrific achievement but you don't rest on your laurels, you look back and think actually, we actually could have done better.

'We've closed that chapter - we want to be even better than we were in the first five years and we're hungrier than ever.'
