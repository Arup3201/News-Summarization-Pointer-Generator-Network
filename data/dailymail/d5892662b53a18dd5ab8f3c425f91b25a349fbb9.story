Failed: Jestin Anthony Joseph, 24, went to the McDonald's in Forth Worth and tried to shoot people in the restaurant but his gun misfired

Customers and employees at a McDonald’s restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, could have been killed in a robbery on Tuesday night if the robber’s gun had not malfunctioned.

Jestin Anthony Joseph, 24, of Allen in Collin County, tried to fire his gun multiple times while pointing it directly at people during the failed heist at the McDonald’s at 4800 South Freeway.

Fort Worth police say he pulled the trigger at least five times, but the gun did not fire.

Police could not explain why the gun didn’t fire inside the store, apart from it being a moment of divine intervention.

‘I’ve never seen anything like that before,’ said Fort Worth Police Sgt Joe Loughman. ‘It must not have been their time to go.’

Joseph went outside the restaurant on two occasions and successfully managed to fire the gun, once into the air and later toward a passing car.

Fort Worth Police Sgt. Joe Loughman said at least 15 employees and patrons, including children, were inside the McDonald’s when Joseph entered shortly after 9pm.

Loughman said the man walked into the store, first asking for a water cup from a cashier, according to the Star Telegram.

After walking to the beverage machine, he pulled out a semiautomatic handgun and pointed it at employees and patrons, demanding their possessions.

At least one man tried to wrestle the gun away from the suspect, Loughman said.

As people started to run from the restaurant, the man pointed the gun at those inside and pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire.

Loughman said the man went outside twice, got his gun to work and fired two rounds in the direction of a passing vehicle. The driver never stopped.

Behind bars: Joseph is being held on a $500,000 bail at Mansfield Jail on suspicion of five counts of aggravated robbery

The suspect then ran south along the service road toward Interstate 20, tossing the gun as he fled.

He was arrested shortly afterward by officers responding to the robbery. No one was reported injured.

Joseph was in the Mansfield Jail on Wednesday night on outstanding warrants and on suspicion of five counts of aggravated robbery, with total bail set at $500,000.

Joseph’s mother had gone to the Allen police station about four hours before the robbery to tell officers that she feared her son was suicidal.

The mother, who asked not to be identified, said she alerted Allen police after her son told her over the phone that people were after him, according to the Star Telegram.

‘He said, “They’re trying to kill me, Mama! I’m going to die tonight! I’m going to die tonight!”’ she said.

Serial criminal: Sgt Jon Felty of Allen Police, who has dealt with Joseph in past incidents, says the man is believed to suffer from 'extreme paranoia'

She said she believes her son had a mental breakdown, just as his father did a few years ago. She said she believes it runs in his father’s family.

‘The only thing I can say to you is that was not my son yesterday. He was not in his right mind.’

Joseph’s mother said she believes the gun malfunctioned ‘because we were praying’.

McDonald’s USA said in a statement: ‘We are extremely grateful that no one was hurt during the situation that occurred on our property Tuesday evening. The safety of our customers and employees is extremely important, and we are fully cooperating with the Fort Worth Police Department in their ongoing investigation.’

Joseph has had run-ins with the law about a half-dozen times since 2005, including for possession of drug paraphernalia and later for assault, according to Sgt. Jon Felty, a spokesman for the Allen Police Department.

‘In some of the other contacts we’ve had with him, he kind of lives a transient lifestyle,’ Felty said.

‘Oftentimes he seems to suffer from extreme paranoia.’

When she heard about the incident involving her son in Fort Worth, Joseph’s mother said she was happy that no one was hurt.
