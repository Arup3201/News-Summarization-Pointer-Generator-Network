Its garish interior would surely make Del Boy scream 'lovely-jubbly'.

But for visitors to this year's Ideal Home Show, the recreation of one of Britain's most famous living rooms will probably serve as a lesson in how not to decorate a home.

The home of the Trotter family from the comedy classic Only Fools and Horses has been lovingly replicated for the exhibition.

Lovely jubbly: Del Boy and Rodney Trotter's famous Peckham council flat from TV's Only Fools and Horses has been given a facelift

The creme de menthe of design: Del Boy's bedroom maintains its distinctive look

Architect George Clarke gave the famous flat a bit of a spruce up containing a range of 80s mementos

Home: Harlech Tower, in Acton, West London, which was used as Nelson Mandela House, the home of the Trotter family in Only Fools and Horses

The Peckham palace redesign sits beside an identically-sized property aimed at showing how a modern council flat can be transformed into a 'multi-purpose living space'.

Architect and TV presenter George Clarke proved he was no plonker as he came up with the space-saving ideas.

The TV replica flat has been furnished with only the finest of 1980s interior design; from faux fur animal print rugs (complete with the creature's head), to the epitome of home-entertaining - a mini-bar.

Chairs surround a glass-topped table, which is nestled alongside the palm-tree printed wallpaper, which has sadly been concealed by a wall dresser.

Thankfully, the brown and yellow 
curtain still manage to catch the eye, along with the chintzy chairs and
swirling patterned carpet.

Only
fools would criticise the way the ceramic animal statue pairs with the 
traffic cone, which leads to Del's bedroom that has a tiger skin throw.

Actor John Challis - who played 
sneering car dealer Boycie in the hit show - and a David Jason lookalike
sampled a few cocktails as they viewed the new and improved living 
room.

George Clarke is 
an architect and TV presenter, who has appeared on Channel 4's 
Restoration Man.

He's also featured on The Great British Property Scandal and George 
Clarke’s Amazing Spaces.

Due to British homes being amongst the smallest in Europe, Mr Clarke hopes the famous TV living room will draw attention to his scheme.

His modernised council flat hopes to demonstrate how to 'rearrange, and reorganise the space to make it more efficient and functional'.

The Ideal Home Show has showcased how to make the most of your living room - and used the beloved Trotter home as a comparison

The update uses the same structure 
and footprint of the Trotters' flat but the internal layout has been 
changed to 'reflect the demands of 21st Century living'.

Mr Clarke said: 'When it comes to our
homes, conventional wisdom dictates bigger is better. But with housing 
stock in short supply and the cost of space at such a premium, those 
wanting to get onto the property ladder are looking for smaller, more 
affordable alternatives to becoming homeowners.

'But small spaces needn’t be full of 
clutter or chaotic. It’s not about the space that you have, it’s 
actually about how creative you are with it; living big in small 
spaces.'

Bustling: An overview of the show at Earls Court today

The iconic British Home Show is at Earls Court, London for its 105th Year, and suggests design ideas and home improvement tips.

The wheeler-dealer duo, from Peckham, south London, were well-known traders on the market, constantly trying to sell broken or useless goods to unsuspecting customers.

They eventually became millionaires and bought upmarket apartments - before losing it all again and returning to their faithful flat.

The show was actually filmed in Harlech Tower in Acton and later Bristol – with his much younger brother, Rodney Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst), and their elderly Grandad, and later Uncle Albert.

The exhibition is full of authentic retro items, including a mug with 
the faces of Prince Charles and Princess Diana (left) and a framed 
picture of Uncle Albert, one of the show's main characters

Some of the items from Del Boy's minbar, including a bottle of Baileys and a halved pineapple, possibly holding a Pina Colada

In keeping with the programme, the room is full of the kind of junk Del Boy sold to make a living

The flat's designers have gone to all lengths to make the room look realistic

Even more junk can be found nestling in very corner of the flat
