Ronald Koeman is poised to be appointed as Southampton manager with his brother Erwin joining as his assistant.

Koeman, 51, left Feyenoord after leading them to second place in the Eredivisie last season.

The south coast outfit saw Mauricio Pochettino depart to Tottenham last month and the quest to appoint his successor has been headed by executive director Les Reed.

Chairman Ralph Krueger claimed Southampton had been inundated with calls from some of the 'highest quality managers in Europe' and that the club are in their best ever position despite Pochettino's exit, having finished eighth last season.

Koeman, who won the European Championship with Holland and the European Cup with PSV in 1988 and with Barcelona four years later, has also managed Ajax, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and AZ Alkmaar.
