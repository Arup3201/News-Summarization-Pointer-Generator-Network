Household favourite: Glove puppet Sooty is set to return to TV screens at the age of 65

The first generation of children to laugh at Sooty’s pranks are now drawing their pensions.

But 65 years after he was created, the classic glove puppet is still working as hard as ever – and is about to start a new Sunday morning kids’ TV series.

Despite being on air almost continuously since the 1950s, The Sooty Show is still a TV favourite because children are bored of watching TV shows that ‘preach’ and ‘moralise’, its latest boss has claimed.

Richard Cadell, who took over Sooty and his sidekicks Sweep and Soo in 1999, said the teddy bear’s mischievous character appeals to toddlers who are bored by more ‘health and safety conscious’ shows.

The 44-year-old said: ‘Sooty has a niche. It works because of the old fashioned slapstick humour. The gunk and the custard pies. Most children’s programmes nowadays are very health and safety conscious.

‘We get away with stuff others can’t. Sooty is naughty and impolite. It is like Tom and Jerry.

'And while other shows are worried about setting a good example to the young, we just want to make children scream with laughter. I’m not trying to preach or moralise. There is too much of that. Children get bored of that.’

Sooty’s character was first created by Harry Corbett in 1948, after he bought an old glove puppet for 7s 6d (37.5p) at a novelty shop in Blackpool.

After making his TV debut in 1952, The Sooty Show went on to become the longest running children’s TV show ever. Harry’s son Matthew took over the act in 1975 before eventually handing the baton over to Mr Cadell.

After a TV production company made a disastrous attempt to turn Sooty into a cartoon animation, Mr Cadell bought the rights for £700,000 and has brought it back to mainstream TV.

In September, a new series of shows will air at 9.10am on Sunday mornings on ITV1 and CITV.

Recent series have regularly drawn in more than 50,000 young viewers per episode.

Matthew Corbett – who still regularly speaks to Mr Cadell about the show - said his father loved the character so much he would drill airholes in the box he was kept in while travelling.

Saying Sooty could go on ‘forever’, he added: ‘I think the reason for Sooty’s success is the simplicity of it, especially in an era where so much television is computer-generated.’

Mr Cadell agreed, saying: ‘Children 
don’t mind that you can sometimes see a piece of string or someone’s 
arm. They know Sooty is not real, but they still want to stroke him and 
say hello when I do live shows. We do it all very frugally, and that is 
part of the charm.

‘It is a classic old double act, with Sweep as the slightly foolish sidekick who always gets the blame. It was inspired by Laurel and Hardy originally. Soo is the serious older sister. Lots of children can relate to that.’

Mr Cadell revealed there have been more than 6,000 Sooty puppets in total, used in both the live theatre shows and the TV programmes.

He said: ‘Sooty gets up to so much mischief he does get worn out. I go through almost one puppet every episode. We refer to them as stunt doubles, because the character of Sooty never dies.

‘I still mourn the passing of each puppet though. Each one is subtly different. Sometimes one eye will by slightly off, giving him a mischievous squint. We donate the old ones to charity, or auction them for good causes. People often claim they have the original Sooty, but there are so many, nobody can be sure.’
