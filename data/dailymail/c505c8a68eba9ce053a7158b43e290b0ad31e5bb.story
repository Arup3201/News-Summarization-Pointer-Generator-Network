A stripper was found guilty on Thursday of the attempted murder of her fiance who had drained his 401k supporting her before ending their relationship.

Vicky Miller, 44, of Plano, Texas, was sentenced to 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine - the maximum penalty for the second-degree felony conviction.

Her former fianc√© Paul Key, 54, had testified that Miller, her son, 
Francisco Hurtado, and family friend Dunkan Boyce tried to kill him when
he went to her house in November 2011 to collect his belongings.

The pair had meet in 2008 when she was dancing topless at Lipstick Cabaret in Dallas and he asked her to marry him after just 30 minutes.

During the trial Key claimed that he drained his 401k and took out a mortgage on his home so he could lavish Miller, who faces unrelated charges of aggravated sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy, with gifts including a car each for her and her son.

'I agreed to support her financially,' Key testified, adding that he spent cash he'd saved over 30 years on the woman. 'I had someone I enjoyed talking with. I thought I could buy loyalty with money.'

He said they regularly met up for breakfast at IHOP following their night shifts and he paid her $2,000 a month to support her so she would quit her job at Lipstick Cabaret.

But the affair, which Key claimed was
non-sexual, turned sour after Miller kept putting off the wedding and 
after three and a half years Key, an AT&T employee, began to think 
he was being used, Dallasnews.com reported.

He said he decided to break up with her and move forward with his life.

Key,
who had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at age 35, said he 
had stopped taking his medication about two months before the breakup 
because he was strapped for cash.

But
he said that had no impact on his ability to remember the alleged 
attempted murder, which he claimed may have been prompted by the 
inaccurate belief that Miller would receive his life insurance payout.

On November 21, 2011, Miller picked 
up Key at his home and brought him to her apartment so he could pick up 
her belongings, court documents reveal. When he had done so he sat down 
on the couch.

That's when he claims someone yanked an extension cord over his head and around his neck trying to strangle him.

Miller's son, Francisco Hurtado, who is now 19, allegedly then placed a pillow over his head and tried to suffocate the man before his friend, Dunkan Boyce, struck him over the head several times with a pan, police said.

As the extension cord began to cut off his air supply, Key testified on Tuesday that his 'initial inclination was to sit back and observe what it's like to die.' But then he said 'I decided to fight back.'

Key managed to escape the boys' clutches and ran outside screaming for help, finally convincing someone at a nearby Dollar General Store to call 911.

Meanwhile, the teens decided to make it look like Key attacked Miller and rearranged the apartment.

Miller also allegedly asked her son to throw her against a wall, hit her and kick her so she looked beat up.

The
son's friend, Boyce, then calls 911 to report the false assault, but 
can be heard on the call shouting at the others to hurry up.

When police arrive, Key was initially arrested by reporting officers but after further investigation, Miller and the two teens were arrested.

During the trial, defense attorney Robbie McClung had told jurors not to judge Miller by her former profession.

'There's not just reasonable doubt,' McClung said. 'There are misperceptions (sic) and innuendo that don't make any sense because Vicky Miller is not guilty.'

In the end the jury took less than three hours to find her guilty.

Miller is awaiting sentencing for the second-degree felony charge. Hurtado and Boyce are both waiting for trial dates in their own cases.
