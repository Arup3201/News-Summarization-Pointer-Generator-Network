A domestic worker in South Africa is just two rounds away from wining the prestigious Masterchef title, while raising awareness of the 'forgotten army' of servants working in the nation's homes. 

Siphokazi Mdlankomo, 39, from Cape Town, is one of the favourites to win the competition after judges quickly recognised her ability to cook and balance flavours. 

Ms Mdlankomo, who is known as Sipho' on the show will take on a former advertising executive, a train driving assistant  and a life skills lecturer in the show's semi-final.

According to South African television station DSTV: 'Sipho, a domestic worker from Cape Town, is the embodiment of the popular adage that “dynamite comes in small packages”. This pint-sized cook is out to prove that domestic workers are not second-class citizens; that their role in South African households should be held in equal regard to any other profession out there. 

'On her first day in boot camp, Sipho had to think on her feet when her original plan of making a consommé didn’t work out – but she kept her cool and made a beautiful aioli to accompany her perfectly pan-fried angelfish. 

'On Day 2, she displayed an impressive skills base once again by making a succulent parma wrapped chicken breast with cauliflower mash and Provencale sauce. The judges quickly noticed that Siphokazi’s talents lie in her vast knowledge of different cooking styles – from classic to modern – coupled with the ability to combine and balance flavours effortlessly.'

In South Africa, one in six working women are in domestic service and many of those are black people working in white households. 

The judges have been wowed by some of her creations, pictured, and her ability to balance delicate flavours 

Speaking in advance of her latest challenge on Thursday, Ms Mdlankomo said: 'Being a domestic worker is just like any other job, which you should be proud of doing. It is a profession from which you earn your income. There are many domestic workers out there, who like me, have hidden secrets, talents and passion. No job should prevent you from following your dream.'

According to The Guardian, Ms Mdlankomo has been with her employer Liz Andreasen for the past nine years.  

Ingrid Engelbrecht, a spokeswoman for Masterchef SA, said: 'People have loved her from the start. It’s an inspirational story.

'Many people have domestic workers who are considered part of the family, but domestic workers have never been showcased on television. 

'Siphokazi’s story is the same as millions in South Africa who are raising a family and cooking for a family along with their own. Many people have been thrilled to see her on TV and doing so well.'
