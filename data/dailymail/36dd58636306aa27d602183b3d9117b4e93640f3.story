A bride who was jilted just weeks before she was due to get married has donated her lavish reception to a disability charity.

Michelle Marxen had planned her dream wedding down to the finest details when her financé suddenly told her he didn't love her anymore.

Instead of letting the ballroom venue, food and entertainment go to waste however, the North Dakota bride-to-be handed it over to a charity so its disabled clients could have a Halloween party instead.

Jilted: Michelle Marxen's boyfriend called off their wedding weeks before the couple were due to get married

When Miss Marxen's boyfriend walked out on her their whole wedding, due to take place on October 19, had been booked and paid for.

'My fairy tale wedding. You know, as a young girl, you dream of your wedding day,' she said.

The limousine, flowers, band and reception at Ramada's Crystal Ballroom could have gone to waste when the wedding, which had cost Miss Marxen thousands of dollars, was cancelled.

'We spent a whole year planning this wedding and it all ended in a phone call,' Miss Marxen told Fox 10.

However, a charity dedicated to enhancing the lives of those with disabilities will now host a Halloween party for the people it cares for.

'What was supposed to be my special day will now be their special day,' Miss Marxen said, after donating the reception to Creative Care for Reaching Independence.

Miss Marxen was jilted the day the couple's wedding invitations were set to go out.

Her fiancé told her 'I love you,' as he left for work but later that day, as Miss Marxen was returning from a funeral, he called with life-changing news.

'He didn’t want to marry me. He said he didn’t love me anymore,' the young woman said.

Her dream wedding may have turned into a nightmare, but Miss Marxen was determined the reception would not go to waste.

'You can’t heal if you’re just going to dwell on what could have been,' she said.

Now, on the day she was supposed to be celebrating her marriage with family and friends, disabled adults will gather at the Crystal Ballroom for a party.

Jody Hudson, of CCRI, said she was speechless when she heard about the offer.

'I could not believe it. I called the next day to make sure it was for real,' Ms Hudson said.

Clients helped by the charity are now busy decorating pumpkins and making decorations for the party they plan to hold in the reception space, WDay News 6 reported.

While the CCRI holds its party, Miss Marxen will be trying to take her mind off what should have been her wedding day with a trip to Las Vegas.

Her donation is similar to one made to Hosea Feed the Hungry recently in Atlanta. Willie and Carol Fowler donated their daughter’s abruptly cancelled wedding reception to about 200 homeless people.
