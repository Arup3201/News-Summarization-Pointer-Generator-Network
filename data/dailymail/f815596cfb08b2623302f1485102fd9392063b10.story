A 35-year-old threw his three-year-old son to his death from the roof of a 52-story skyscraper and then jumped killing himself, after a judge ordered him to hand over the boy to his estranged wife.

The killer dad has been identified as Dmitriy Kanarikov, a systems analyst from Brooklyn.

His son Kirill plunged 46 stories after being pushed from a ledge on the roof of the building. He landed on a sixth floor landing before crashing down onto a John Jay College building next door to the highrise.

He was alive when paramedics arrived on scene, but died minutes later at St. Luke’s Roosevelt Hospital.

Kanarikov is a native of Ukraine and worked as a systems analyst for TIAA-CREF in New York. He lived in Brooklyn, but was selling the family home

Tragedy: A 35-year-old man and a three-year-old boy are dead after reportedly jumping from this midtown building

Kanarikov was found on a fourth floor landing of the Midtown Medical Pavilion next door. He died at the scene.

He lives in Brooklyn, but reportedly accessed the South Park Tower at West 60th Street and Eighth Avenue because a friend lives there, according to the New York Post.

The Post reports that investigators believe little Kirill was thrown or pushed from the tower because he was found farther from the roof deck than his father's body - who likely plunged straight down after jumping.

Kanarikov was supposed to hand his son off to his estranged wife Svetlana Bukharina at a police precinct today after a messy custody dispute. He and Kirill never showed up.

The Ukrainian immigrant left no note explaining his actions.

In September, Kanarikov wrote on his Facebook page, 'I want to be the best dad and husband - nothing is more important to me right now'

Tragic: The NYPD is investigating the horrific murder-suicide. The four-year-old child died at a local hospital. The father died at the scene

A family member who answered the phone at a relative's house sounded distraught before telling MailOnline she could answer no questions.

Kanarikov wrote on his Facebook page in September: 'I want to be the best dad and husband. Nothing is more important to me right now.'

Investigators have constructed an opaque bubble at the place the two are believed to have been found and are now focusing their investigation on an alleyway between the tower and a school next door.

'They were pumping his chest and doing working on him, and nothing,' Luis Ortiz told NY1. 'You could tell that he was already slipping away.'

Another witness told the station the boy was wearing Christmas pajamas as he was wheeled away with paramedics trying to keep him alive.

Unthinkable: Their son Kirill, 3, was having his first unsupervised visit with his father on Sunday when Kanarikov did the unthinkable and shoved his little boy off a New York City skyscraper

On the scene: Police are still investigating the apparent suicide

Kanarikov's body is wheeled away by the Medical Examiner's office after detectives finished examining the crime scene Sunday. Police say Kanarikov died instantly when he landed on a nearby building

'Being a parent of two kids myself, it’s just heartbreaking,' another witness told NY1.

The 500-unit West 60th Street building is 52-stories high. It is only blocks from both Lincoln Center and the Time Warner Center.
