Paul Gascoigne has told of his latest alcohol relapse saying he knew if he went to hospital he would stop his latest drinking binge.

The former England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer was released from hospital earlier this week after he was seen wandering the streets clutching a bottle of gin and cans of beer after seven months of sobriety.

The pictures showed the ex-midfielder, who also played for Lazio, Everton and Rangers, slumped with his head in hands, outside his penthouse apartment in the exclusive Sandbanks area in Dorset.

Paul Gascoigne, who has spoke of his latest alcohol torment, is pictured at his flat in Sandbanks, Dorset after being released from hospital earlier this week 

Mr Gascoigne being led into an ambulance last week after his latest alcohol relapse, which led him to spend four days in hospital 

Later looking frail and dishevelled, he was helped into an ambulance by a police officer.

It had been said he had been on a three-week binge at his rented apartment in the latest chapter of his long battle with alcoholism.

However, he now claims he had only been drinking for a few hours and started because he had been served with an eviction notice from his flat.

He was taken from the flat by medics and driven to Poole Hospital, where he underwent a four-day detox.

Now the 47-year-old has spoke of the moment of when he saw the ambulance to take him to hospital, saying he knew he instantly had to get inside.

In an interview with the Sunday Mirror he said: 'In the past I have had binges that have lasted days, weeks, months. This time I had only been drinking for a few hours but I knew if I went to hospital I would be OK and that I would come through the other side. And I did.'

When asked by the newspaper what drove him back to drinking, he explained: 'Being told I had to go left me really low.

Last week the former footballer  was seen wandering the streets clutching a bottle of gin and cans of beer after seven months of sobriety 

'I started off by just buying a couple of cans of lager. Then that quickly became four cans, and I was off to buy a bottle of gin.'

The ex-midfielder, who became a firm favourite with England fans also added that people had been leaving alcohol on his doorstep after finding out he had moved into the flat.

It is said that Mr Gascoigne rang the police when people started continually ringing his doorbell and due to them being concerned by his voice, they attended his flat where they found him drunk and distressed and called an ambulance.

He is now back at the flat after being released from hospital but only has two weeks left on his lease.

On Monday he was pictured leaving the Poole Hospital and seemed in better shape when he appeared in a short-sleeved shirt.

He added: 'I know I can overcome this. I am an alcoholic so I am taking one day at a time, but I will get there.'

Mr Gascoigne, pictured playing against Belgium at the 1990 World Cup, became a firm favourite with England fans  

During his long battle with alcohol, Mr Gascoigne has been to rehab several times and underwent treatment last April at the Cottonwood clinic in Arizona paid for footballing friends such as Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and DJ Chris Evans.

It had been claimed that Mr Gascoigne was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward Sunday League side.

Mr Gascoigne, who has been plagued by alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football ten years ago when he made five appearances for then-League Two side Boston United. 

Since his latest relapse, Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives in Sandbanks, had offered the ex-footballer a way back into the game by coaching youngsters at the west London club.

He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and I said "I will pick you up in the mornings Gazza, come training with me. Do a little bit of work with the kids." 

QPR boss Harry Redknapp, who says he had offered Mr Gascoigne a coaching job at the club 

'I would love it if he would do that, if he wants to do it I would pick him up every morning at 5:45am at the end of his road and bring him in.'

But Mr Gascoigne has said he doesn't think he could take up the offer, which he says he was grateful for, due to Glenn Hoddle's involvement at the club.

Mr Hoddle was the then England manager in 1998 who famously dropped the midfielder from that year's World Cup squad.

High-profile incidents involving alcohol and Mr Gascoigne include being sacked as manager of Kettering in 2005 after he was accused of being drunk at games.

He also appeared at the scene of the stand-off between the police and gunman Raoul Moat in 2010. 

Arriving in Rothbury, Northumberland, he claimed he was a friend of Moat and said he had brought him ''a can of lager, some chicken, fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown''.

But he is still remembered by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch.
