Financial advisor David Low last night revealed he is heading up a consortium bidding to seize control of troubled Hibs in a £3.5million deal.

Majority shareholder Sir Tom Farmer has authorised under-fire chairman Rod Petrie to find a buyer for the club’s parent company HFC Holdings Ltd.

And Low, one of the leading figures in Fergus McCann’s Celtic takeover, is believed to have joined forces with former Easter Road chairman Malcolm McPherson and Frank Lynch - former owner of Celtic Nation - to make an offer for the club.

A rainbow alliance of supporters groups are also interested in establishing community ownership at the club and have held talks with Petrie, who was the subject of fierce protests over his stewardship of the club following last season’s relegation to the Championship.

Insisting he has already spoken to influential supporters groups about joining forces, however, Low told Sportsmail last night: ‘I have made an offer for Hibernian Football Club on behalf of a group of investors.

‘We were encouraged to make an offer by Mr Petrie, we made an offer to Mr Petrie and we have met his nominated advisors for discussions. Beyond that, the ball is now in their court.’

Low has financial backing from the UK and America and believes he can deliver the legacy guarantees on the club’s welfare being sought by Sir Tom Farmer.

Sportsmail has also learned, however, that Supporters Direct Scotland have been contacted by several groups of supporters and are formulating plans for a community-ownership proposal after former Hibs midfielder Paul Kane led a series of fan protests over Petrie’s stewardship in the summer.

Hibs face Livingston in their Championship curtain raiser at Easter Road on Saturday afternoon - and the West Lothian club have also become embroiled in boardroom strife after being hit with several SFA charges relating to key shareholder Neil Rankine.

Livingston have been accused of failing to disclose that Rankine, described by the SFA as shareholder of parent company Livingston 5 Ltd, also holds interests in Championship rivals Dumbarton along with East Fife.

Charges include failure to act in good faith to the SFA; providing false, misleading and/or inaccurate information on their official return; failing to specify Rankine on official returns; not acting in the best interests of football by their non-disclosure of Rankine’s other interests; and of holding power to influence the management or administration of two other clubs.

The SFA statement added: ‘Please note that neither East Fife nor Dumbarton are under investigation and there is no suggestion of improper conduct on their part at this stage.”

A hearing date has been pencilled in for September 10.

Hibs boss Alan Stubbs has raided his former club Everton to sign 19-year-old winger Matthew Kennedy on an initial six-month loan deal. 

The Scotland under-21 international becomes Hibernian’s fifth recruit of the summer and they hope he can be cleared in time to make his debut against Livingston today.
