The United States has renewed airstrikes against a terrorist group in Syria a month after a high ranking official went on a national news program to warn the public that they pose an imminent threat to the country.

According to a report, the U.S. conducted five airstrikes on Wednesday night that targeted senior leaders of the Khorasan group.

The Pentagon could not confirm the strikes, but said it had seen the reports.

The United States renewed airstrikes against the Khorosan group in Syria on Wednesday evening, after last going after the group in September (seen above)

The September attack (above) was not as successful as hoped, with many high ranking officials in the terrorist group managing to escape with explosives 

Foreign Policy spoke with a defense official who said the attacks used both manned and unmanned aircraft and were conducted in the town of Sarmada.

These airstrikes come a month after FBI Director James Comey appeared on 60 Minutes and described the Khorasan as 'serious people, bent on destruction.'

He went on to warn people, saying the group would likely strike in this country 'very, very soon.' 

The United States previously launched an airstrike against the group in September, but failed to take out any high ranking officials.

Some claim this was because they were previously tipped off by news reports.

Imminent threat: The attacks on the Khorasan group (as seen in September above) are crucial according to FBI director James Comey, who said they could attack U.S. 'very, very soon'

Not only did these men manage to escape, but they were also able to take with them many of the high-tech explosive devices they plan to use for their own attacks.

That attack used Tomahawk missiles launched by the U.S. Navy.
