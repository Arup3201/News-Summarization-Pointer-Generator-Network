An undercover police officer who infiltrated a drug gang told a court how he was forced to jump for his life from a first floor window after a secret camera fell out his clothes.

The officer, who was posing as an addict, was locked in a room and savagely beaten after his cover was blown, it is claimed.

In an alleged scene reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, the officer, identified only as Officer Deano, claims he was exposed when a secret camera fell out of his shirt.

Dramatic: In a scene reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, the officer's cover was blown when he was interrogated by the gang and a secret camera was exposed

He said when the gang leader left the room to get a knife, he managed to force open a window and leap to safety.

A trial at Basildon Crown Court, Essex, heard the officer had been buying cocaine and heroin from the gang known as The Bush Boys with a colleague between July and November last year.

His cover was blown after gang members became suspicious and interrogated him at a flat in the town.

Mohamed Hassan, 31, from Brockley, south London, Perry Bohm, 19, from Woolwich, and Thomas Symons, 19, from Woolwich, are all accused of being involved in the gang and of attacking the officer.

Giving evidence from behind a screen to protect his identity, Officer Deano told the court the attack on November 26 last year was the most terrifying moment of his 12-year career.

He said: 'I was terrified and in genuine fear for my safety and well-being. I'd been involved in numerous frightening situations, but nothing compared to the fear I felt at that moment.

'I was aware the front door was barricaded so the only exit I could reasonably consider was the window.

'I went to the window and undid the handle and attempted to push the window open - to my horror it only opened two inches.

'I was desperate to get out of that situation and feared for my life so I took a couple of steps back and shoulder barged the window open.

'I climbed onto the window sill and jumped down about 12-feet onto the pavement.

'When I landed I felt a sharp pain jar up both of my shins - it was incredibly painful but by that stage I was almost in a state of blind panic.

'I sprinted as fast as I could away from that address to safety.'

Officer Deano

Officer Deano told the jury that he was rumbled when his recording equipment fell to the floor as gang members interrogated him, suspecting he might be an undercover police officer.

During a struggle between the officer, the three men and the recording device fell to the floor.

The officer said: 'The three lads just stopped and stared at it - it seemed like time just stood still.

'After that brief moment of stillness, one shouted: "It's a camera... He struck me in the face and stamped on the device".'

Martyn Levett, prosecuting, said: 'They grabbed Deano's arms. Hassan punched him hard in the face, which seemed to be an indication for the other two to pile in on him.

Big drop: The window that the officer chose to jump out of was around 12ft above the pavement

'The boys landed punches on his shoulder, neck and back of the head.'

The court heard that Hassan - who has been referred to as a 'controlling force' within the gang - then left the room before calling for a 'shank' - street slang for a knife.

Mr Levett continued: 'These shouts for a knife were enough for Officer Deano to decide it was time he made the dramatic decision to jump out of the window and run for his life.

'Mercifully his injuries were not as serious as may have been.'

The three suspects are charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs (namely crack cocaine and heroin), robbery of covert equipment to the value of £4,500, attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent and attempting to cause actual bodily harm.

It is claimed the men bragged about their wealth by posing for pictures with wads of £1,000 in cash and spent thousands on designer clothes, accessories and holidays.

When police raided the home of Aisha Aden, 24, who was believed to be Hassan's girlfriend, they found 102 receipts for Louis Vuitton and Chanel accessories paid for with cash.

The court heard that the men dealt drugs from a playground, a hotel, alleyways, subways and the homes of drug addicts.

The trial continues.
