Holidaymakers will feel like they are on top of the world on the balloon expedition with veteran pilot Chris Dewhirst, the first person to fly a hot air balloon over Everest. 

The journey takes most of the day to complete and is weather dependent, meaning the balloon’s passengers may spend a significant time on the ground in Nepal before it is safe to depart and soar over the breath-taking landscape.

A solo reservation costs a cool $4.8m (approximately £3m), while a couple can get on board for a reduced price of $5.2m (approximately £3.3m).
