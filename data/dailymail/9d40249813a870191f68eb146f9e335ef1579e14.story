Jailed: Julia Patterson stole £471,552 from an elderly relative, spending the money on clothes

A shopaholic who robbed an elderly relative of almost half a million pounds has been jailed for two years.

Julia Patterson, 43, siphoned the money from a 88-year-old relative and spent it on designer clothes.

Social services became suspicious of Patterson when she gained power of attorney for the victim in September 2011.

They then alerted South Yorkshire Police, who launched an investigation.

Economic Crime Unit officers 
investigated the victim's bank accounts and found that £251,331 had been 
transferred directly to Patterson.

A further £212,039 was paid by cheque to unknown payees, £4,566 was made in cheque payments to 
Patterson herself and £3,615 to an unknown credit card.

The total amount taken from the woman's accounts was £471,552.

The 88-year-old victim, who lived in a Sheffield care home, and was only given a small living allowance by Patterson.

It later emerged that Patterson was in arrears with paying for the relative's care.

Patterson was arrested on December 18, 2011 and charged with fraud by abuse of position.

Patterson, of Clumber Road, Ranmoor, Sheffield, pleaded guilty at Sheffield Crown Court and was jailed for two years.

Sadly her victim died on January 26, 2013 without seeing justice done.

Detective Constable Elizabeth Claridge said: 'This has been a long investigation and a good example of how working in partnership with other agencies can produce a positive outcome.

Guilty: Patterson, who gained power of attorney for her victim in September 2011, was jailed for two years for fraud by abuse of position at Sheffield Crown Court

'Julia Patterson has been compliant throughout the investigation and shown some remorse.

'However she has nothing to show for the money that has been spent and the vast majority was for materialistic personal gain.

'I am sure that the woman would be saddened that a family member had taken advantage of her to such an extent.

'The investigation sends out a message to others who are in a position of trust and abuse that position that the police will prosecute and protect the vulnerable members of our society.'
