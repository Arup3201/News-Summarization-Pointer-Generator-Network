Watford produced a stirring second-half display to score twice after being reduced to ten men with 25 minutes to play to beat Huddersfield 4-2 on a dramatic afternoon at Vicarage Road.

Gabriel Tamas was sent off for the home side 65 minutes in but after that Keith Andrews and Almen Abdi (his second) put Huddersfield to bed.

Prior to that, Troy Deeney and Abdi had seen goals cancelled out by Harry Bunn and Murray Wallace.

Norwich City's sequence of four consecutive victories came to an end as an impressive Bournemouth side left Carrow Road with a well deserved point from a 1-1 draw.

The Canaries went into the game on a crest of a wave after a fine run that included a derby win at Ipswich and they looked good for another three points when Lewis Grabban scored against his former club after just 14 minutes.

But Eddie Howe's side retained their composure and levelled just before half-time through Callum Wilson, the man who replaced Grabban at Dean Court.

Wolves impressive attacking duo of Nouha Dicko and Bakary Sako combined to ensure that the team celebrated 125 years of league football at Molineux in style with a 3-1 Skybet Championship win over Blackburn Rovers.

Dicko opened the scoring before Sako helped himself to a double as Kenny Jackett's side collected their fourth win from five games in the match the club had earmarked to commemorate the landmark.

The duo put Wolves two goals ahead before Jordan Rhodes gave Blackburn a lifeline from the penalty spot, but his side could not build on that with Sako sealing his brace to sentence Blackburn to a second defeat in three games.

All good things: Norwich 100% start to the Championship was ended by a 1-1 draw against Bournemouth

Defender Lewis Dunk scored deep into added time to rescue a point for Brighton in a 2-2 draw against unbeaten Charlton at the Amex Stadium.

Striker Igor Vetokele twice put the Addicks ahead to take his tally to five goals, but Dunk produced two headers of his own to give Sami Hyypia's men a share of the points.

The Seagulls went behind for the second successive game when Angolan striker Vetokele struck after only four minutes.

Derby endured a frustrating afternoon when they were held at home for the first time this season as Ipswich fought back to draw 1-1 at the iPro Stadium.

Chris Martin pounced from close range to give Derby an early lead but, after Jeff Hendrick was taken off with what looked a serious arm injury, Christophe Berra headed in from a free-kick in the 52nd minute.

David McGoldrick was in the Ipswich team that drew 4-4 at Derby last season, but his absence from the squad only added to growing speculation that he will join Leicester on Monday.

Scott McDonald scored one and set up another as Millwall made it three wins from their opening five Sky Bet Championship games by beating crisis club Blackpool 2-1 at the Den.

The Australia international converted Jack Powell's free-kick after 33 minutes before setting up Scott Malone to make it two just after the break.

Substitute Nile Ranger got Blackpool back into the game but they were unable to grab an equaliser.

Simon Cox grabbed the only goal as Reading edged to a smash-and-grab Sky Bet Championship win at Middlesbrough.

The Royals, who narrowly missed out on the play-offs last season, had picked up just five points from their opening five games.

Yet the long trip back home will feel a great deal better after Cox's neat finish earned an undeserved three points on Teesside.  

At the double: Wigan forward Callum McManaman netted a brace for Wigan against Birmingham

Wigan wiped the floor with beleaguered Birmingham in a horribly one-sided Sky Bet Championship encounter at the DW Stadium.

Callum McManaman was again the pick of the Latics players with two first-half goals as the home side led 3-0 at the break.

Andrew Taylor and substitute Martyn Waghorn grabbed the others for Wigan, who could have won even more comprehensively than 4-0 such was their total superiority.

Rotherham hit the crossbar twice but lost out 2-0 to a workmanlike Brentford who struck in added time in both halves.

Andre Gray put the Londoners in front just before the interval after being set up by Alan Judge, and the game was made safe in the final seconds when substitute Nick Proschwitz scored from close range.
