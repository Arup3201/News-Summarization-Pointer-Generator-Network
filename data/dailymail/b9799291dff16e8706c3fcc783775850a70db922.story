Charged: Dale 'Bugsy' Wakefield has been accused of stabbing 71-year-old veteran George Mohr over 70 times outside Doylestown station in Pennslyvania

Violent: The veteran was found unconscious and bleeding outside the station with multiple wounds

Wakefield allegedly attacked the 
veteran outside Doylestown train station in Pennsylvania on July 3, but 
no motive for the horrific incident has been revealed.

Investigators say Wakefield called his sister and said he had stabbed someone and wanted to flee to North Dakota but was in Baltimore.

He was arrested last Thursday in 
Baltimore following a tip-off from his sister.

Mohr remained in critical condition for three days after being found with 
more than 70 stab wounds around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday outside 
the train station.

Mohr was found unconscious and bleeding in the street. WFMZ reported that the veteran had been stabbed in the head, chest, arms, hands, back, had 'numerous facial fractures and a brain injury.'

Wakefield has a history of violent crime and was on probation at the time of the attack, WFMZ reported.
