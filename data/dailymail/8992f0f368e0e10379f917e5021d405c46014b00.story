A paedophile imam who abused young girls while teaching at a mosque has been jailed for two years.

Ebrahim Yusuf Kazi, 67, was told by a judge he would have been jailed for longer - but the law prevented it as the offences took place 27 years ago.

The cleric sexually assaulted three victims - all aged under 11 - during class as he taught groups of youngsters alone inside the mosque, Swindon Crown Court heard.

He would invite the girls to read a passage from a book in front of the other children - before groping and touching their genitals under the desk.

He also locked himself in a toilet cubicle with one of the girls, removed her clothes before he touched and licked her body.

Kazi's campaign of abuse only 
surfaced 27 years later when the brave victims finally decided to speak 
out and confront him in court.

The women wept yesterday as they saw 
Kazi jailed after being convicted on five counts of sexual assault at 
the court in Wiltshire.

Judge Euaun Ambrose said: 'You were in a position of very considerable status, trust and authority.

'It was a position of total power and respect - not only within the mosque but also within the local Muslim community.

'You were trusted by those who 
attended the mosque. You were also trusted by the parents who sent their
children to be taught by you.

'However, you wasted the opportunities the position gave you and indecently assaulted three of these children.

'All were pre-pubescent girls and all were entrusted to your care.

'This was a gross breach of trust. 
Against all this you continue to deny any responsibility for these 
offences and have shown no remorse.

'There has become much stiffer 
sentences for this type of behaviour but I am obliged as a matter of law
to sentence you in regard to the law at the time.

'Had these offences been committed more recently the sentences that I pass would be much, much longer.'

Speaking after the sentencing, PC Dawn Simmonds, from Wiltshire Police, branded Kazi a 'scheming paedophile'.

She said: 'I am frustrated that the court could not impose a longer sentence. He is a scheming paedophile.

'But I am pleased the judge has recognised the offences that Kazi did.

'As abuses of trust go it was the ultimate really and will effect the victims for the rest of their lives.

'Not
only did he subject these children to these despicable acts but he has 
shown no remorse for his actions, having now also put them through the 
ordeal of a trial.

'I would like to thank the victims for having the courage to come forward.'

Stephen Dent, prosecuting, said Kazi 
preyed on the youngsters while imam at the town's Broad Street Mosque, 
between June 1979 and April 1985.

He taught large groups of around 20 pupils alone in a room - making girls come up and read passages from a book to him.

He would then fondle their legs from underneath a desk, touching their private parts until they finished the passage.

Kazi's three devastated victims - 
aged around eight, nine and ten when the abuse started - claimed each 
terrifying and repeated episode could carry on for as long as 15 
minutes.

He groomed one of his victims and 
continued to abuse her over a number of years.

He would take her to a 
toilet cubicle and progressed, over a period of time, from touching her 
under her clothes to stripping her and licking her body parts.

The court heard that the cleric was 'revered' in the girl's family so she did not speak out.

When one of the other girls told her 
parents what Kazi did to her - the defendant angrily branded her a 
'liar' and the allegations went away.

Another family pulled their girl out of the mosque, after her brother witnessed the abuse.

They were forced to give evidence against Kazi at the trial last month which convicted him of five counts of sexual assault.

Judge Ambrose, quoting from impact 
statements of the three victims - now all grown women - said one still 
had nightmares about the abuse.

They all said it continued to affect their lives.

Martin Steen, defending, said Kazi had moved to Gloucester since the offences and was now a respected member of the community.

He claimed that Kazi, who is 
suffering with bad health and depression, has had to install panic 
alarms in his home since the offences came to light.

Mr Steen handed the judge 24 letters 
from community members, praising Kazi. One woman said she would never 
think twice about leaving her child with him.

He said: 'Perceptions have changed 
and in the mean time this man has changed. He has behaved impeccably in 
terms of support given to the community.'

As well as jailing Kazi for two years, Judge Ambrose also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order against him.

The defendant, dressed in white 
religious robes and a Muslim skull cap, looked quizzically at his 
interpreter - translating in his native Gujarati - as he was ordered 
down to the cells.
