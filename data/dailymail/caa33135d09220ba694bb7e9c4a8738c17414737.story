The nine-year-old boy who died trying to rescue his grandfather from a fire after saving six other relatives was today honored with a firefighter's funeral.

Tyler Doohan, from East Rochester, New York, was laid to rest nine days after he succumbed to smoke inside the trailer next to his grandfather, whom relatives called his 'best friend'.

Local firefighters, who have adopted the heroic child as one of their own, lined outside St John of Rochester Catholic Church on Wednesday as Tyler and the two other victims were remembered.

Penfield Fire Chief Chris Ebmeyer gave Tyler's heartbroken mother, Crystal Vrooman, a red-and-white helmet with a shield bearing her son's name, the Democrat and Chronicle reported.

'We consider him an honorary firefighter,' Eberman said.

Officials had previously said that more than 100 firefighters would attend the service as a tribute to the boy.

Vrooman called her son a 'sweet boy' with a sense of humor everyone loved.

'I wish you were here for me to hold you,' Vrooman said, WROC reported. 'I know you don't want to see us sad, but we will see you again someday and we will be happy again. You will never be forgotten.'

The funerals of the other two victims,
 his grandfather Lewis Beach and his step-greatgrandfather, 54-year-old Stephen Smith, were also 
held at the same time.

After the deaths, the story made 
headlines across the U.S. - and reached a basketball team in Manitowoc, 
Wisconsin. The players traveled through the night to act as pallbearers 
at the funeral.

'The players were taken with the story,' said their coach, Phil Budervic told the Democrat and Chronicle.

'Our
 core values are compassion and community and we teach them that 
compassion has no limits and community has no boundaries. They looked at
 this as if it happened next door.'

The
 boy, from East Rochester, was staying with relatives in nearby Penfield
 on the morning of January 20. Vrooman recalled hugging her son goodbye 
before the sleepover.

But
 around 4.45 a.m. Monday, Tyler noticed a fire had broken out in the 
narrow trailer when his four-year-old cousin's blanket set alight.Â 

Vrooman

 told said in a previous interview that, after waking six of his 
relatives - four adults and two children - and making sure they were 
safe, he ran back inside 
the burning trailer.

'He just ran to the back steps and my sister followed him and tried to stop him,' said Vrooman.

The boy's grandfather used a wheelchair and would have been unable to get out of the home on his own, Ebmeyer said.

'By that time, the fire had traveled 
to the back of the trailer,' said Ebmeyer. 'Unfortunately they both 
succumbed to heat and smoke.'

Vrooman added: 'It was his best friend, and he just tried to save him.'

The
 child's body was discovered by firefighters in the rear bedroom just a 
few feet away from the bed of his disabled grandfather.

Authorities said it appeared the child was trying to lift the elderly 
man off the bed when he was overcome by smoke and flames.

'All I could think about is how he couldn't breathe, how scared he must have been, Vrooman told WHAM. 'I'm just so grateful that he went with people that he loved. He didn't go alone.'

Ebmeyer
 said the trailer had no working smoke detector. He said that with so 
many people in one small mobile home, one alarm could have easily woken 
everyone in time to survive.

There was at least one space heater inside the trailer, he said.

Another relative was killed in the fire along with several pets - including dogs, cats, a rabbit and hamsters, Ebmeyer said.

Ebmeyer said if it weren't for Tyler's actions, the number of fatalities could have been much higher.

'He saved those other people,' he said.
