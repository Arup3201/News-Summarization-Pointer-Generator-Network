The Duchess of Cambridge welcomed in the first signs of spring today in a mint green coat.

Kate was at Windsor Castle attending the National Review of the Queen's Scouts for the first time in place of the Queen, who is celebrating her 87th birthday privately.

A volunteer in the Scout Association, Kate, 31, who is expecting her first baby in July, looked obviously pregnant for the first time in an extremely short pastel Mulberry coat, fawn pill box hat and her favourite nude LK Bennett heels.

Kate has worn her Whiteley Cappuccino hat on several previous occasions, including the Epsom Derby.

The event is a day of celebration, bringing together 400 Queen’s Scouts and their invited guests to celebrate the achievements of young people and young adults who have achieved the prestigious award.

It is gained by carrying out regular community service for a year, learning new skills, completing a four day expedition in unknown terrain; taking part in a residential project and then sharing what has been learned with their peers.

During the event, The Duchess of Cambridge spent time talking with some of the 400-plus Queen’s Scouts from around the UK and the Commonwealth.

The Duchess also met gallantry award holders, who have been nominated for their bravery and heroism and meeting adversity in their everyday lives.

The tradition of the annual celebration event within Windsor Castle dates back eighty years.

Since
 its inception, tens of thousands of young men and women have been 
honoured with a King’s or Queen’s Scout Award for their own outstanding 
personal achievements.

Today, The Scout Association hailed 
the Duchess, who volunteers occasionally with a Cub Scout group close to
 her home in North Wales, for a sharp increase in the number of adult 
volunteers.

A spokesman for the Scouts said the Duchess had done around half a dozen volunteering sessions with her local cubs this year.

'She loves it. I can't see her giving it up,' said Simon Carter, assistant director of the Scout Association.

The Duchess is 
one of 2,812 new adult volunteers to join this year. These figures 
represent the second biggest increase in adult volunteers since 1986.

The Scouting Association credited Kate with boosting volunteer numbers within the organisation

As
 well as attracting more adults the total number of teenagers in 
Scouting has almost doubled in the last 10 years, from 23,446 in 2003 to
 40,578 in 2013.

However, 
despite attracting more adults, the Movement still has 37,867 young 
people on waiting lists who are unable join up because even more adult 
volunteers are needed.

Bear Grylls, Chief Scout, said: 'It’s
 great that so many adults are joining the Scouts, and I am sure the 
increase has had much to do with the Duchess of Cambridge becoming a 
Scout volunteer last year.

'The Duchess is an incredible role model and she helps us show that Scouting’s not just for boys.

'She’s also such a generous volunteer
 and everyone is so excited to have her in the Scouting family. Many 
people have followed her lead and are getting involved and enjoying the 
adventure.'

Chief Scout Bear Grylls said the Duchess is a 'generous volunteer' within the 'Scouting family'

He added: 'All 
the young people at Windsor Castle ceremony have given so much time and 
energy to achieve their Queen’s Scout Awards, and I admire their spirit 
so much.

'They are huge inspirations to all the other Scouts across in the UK and I am so pleased that both the Duchess of Cambridge and Scouting have honoured them. Reaching Queen's Scout is a remarkable achievement and along the way they will have all had the adventure of a lifetime.'

As one of the UK’s most high profile figures, it’s hoped the Duchess’ involvement will inspire other adults to get involved in Scouting.

With waiting lists at an all-time high of
 almost 38,000, there is an urgent need for more volunteers, in order to
 meet the growing demand.

The Duchess, pictured during a visit to the Great Tower Scout Camp last month, has volunteered with her local North Wales cubs about six times this year

The Duchess of Cambridge was last seen in public with the Queen when she accompanied her on a visit to Baker Street underground station to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground where she was given a 'Baby on Board' badge

Sazeda Patel, a volunteer from Blackburn, said: 'I didn’t think I’d have the time to volunteer, but the Scouts make it really easy to volunteer around my other commitments – and they let me give as much or as little time as I’m able.

'I did my training with the Duchess in Cumbria last month and had a great day with her. If someone as busy as the Duchess can find time to volunteer, anyone can! I couldn’t recommend volunteering more highly; I just wish I’d got involved sooner.'

All this underlines the fact that Scouting is the largest co-educational youth Movement in the UK. On the back of eight consecutive years of growth, total membership has increased over 20% since 2005, to 536,787 this year.

The Queen attended the event last year and in 2007.
