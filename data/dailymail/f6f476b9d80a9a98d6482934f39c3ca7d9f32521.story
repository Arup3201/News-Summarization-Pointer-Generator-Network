A 17-year-old girl has pleaded not guilty to nearly a dozen charges stemming from a January crime rampage she embarked on while high on meth, which left both a Utah County sheriff's sergeant and her boyfriend dead.

Meagan Grunwald, who is being tried as an adult, spoke quietly in a Provo courtroom on Monday as she entered her pleas against charges of murder, attempted murder and other counts.

The teenager is the only surviving suspect from the January 30 police chase and shootout.

Her attorney, Dean Zabriskie, told reporters after the arraignment that Grunwald plans to take the stand in her own defense at trial and will testify that her 27-year-old boyfriend forced her at gunpoint to participate in the crime rampage.

'I'm not guilty': Megan Grunwald, 17, is facing life in prison on a dozen charges for the shooting death of a sheriff's deputy in Utah, but has told a court that her boyfriend - who died in the ensuing chase - forced her at gunpoint to take part in the January crime rampage

Life: Grunwald is 17, which makes her ineligible for the death penalty, but prosectors say she is culpable enough to be charged with murder, even if she didn't pull the trigger. If convicted, she faces up to life in prison

Unprovoked: Utah County Sheriff's Deputy Cory 
Wride was shot dead by Grunwald's boyfriend after trying to help the 
couple, who he thought was having car troubles

deputies shot Jose Angel Garcia-Juaregui (left) in the head and his 
girlfriend Grunwald (right)  was arrested. Garcia-Juaregui died the 
following day in the hospital. Grunwald is now facing all the charges, but has pleaded not guilty

Prosecutors say Angel Garcia-Juaregui is the one who shot Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Cory Wride and another deputy.

But they argue Grunwald drove the couple during the chase in a pickup truck registered to the teenager and her mother.

Investigators also have said Grunwald participated in the crimes, including a carjacking.

Garcia-Juaregui, a fugitive, died from injuries he sustained in a shootout with police shortly before law enforcement arrested the pair.

During the crime spree, Grunwald was intimidated, coerced and 'scared to death', Zabriskie said.

'We mourn, as the whole community does, for this dead police officer, and the other one that was horribly injured,' Zabriskie said.

'But we just don't see that our client is responsible for that and we think the evidence will prove that.'

Chief Deputy Utah County Attorney Tim Taylor said after court Monday that his office has not discussed the possibility of a plea deal with the teenager's attorneys, who are reviewing thousands of documents of evidence that prosecutors have shared.

'We obviously know that she was there. We know that she participated,' he said.

'But should there be some sort of plea offer in that case, that's something we're going to be looking at.'

End of the road: The hours-long chase on January 30 finally 
came to an end when the couple's hijacked car hit a second set of spikes
 and they crashed

Grunwald's relatively young age is something they'll consider when making a decision about a plea deal, Taylor said.

'She's a young girl. But we know that young people can still do horrific crimes,' he said.

Justice: Police were finally able to stop the truck, which was driven the whole time by Grunwald, with a road spike

Taylor said if prosecutors consider a plea deal, they will discuss it with Wride's family first.

At a two-day hearing in April, prosecutors played dash-cam videos from about half a dozen officers involved in the pursuit along snowy highways in central Utah.

Prosecutors with the Utah County Attorney's Office also presented telephone records that showed Grunwald called her mother during the chase, but neither the teenager nor her mother called 911.

Grunwald is facing charges under Utah laws that make participating in and assisting with a crime nearly as serious as committing it.

Besides murder and attempted murder, Grunwald is charged with obstructing justice, aggravated robbery and use of a controlled substance.

The teenager tested positive for methamphetamine after the chase, court records show.

A day before the chase, an arrest warrant had been issued for Garcia-Juaregui that alleged violations of his parole conditions.

He was paroled from a Utah prison in December 2012 after serving 4 1/2 years for attempted homicide.

Recovery: Sherwood spent 19 days in hospital but was finally allowed to go home on Tuesday

Grunwald could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

She is ineligible for the death penalty because she is under 18.

Documents filed in court earlier this year shed light on the dramatic crime spree that ended in two deaths on the I-15 roadway.

Wride stopped to help Grunwald and her boyfriend around 1pm because he thought they were having car trouble and wanted to help.

Grunwald
was driving the car with her boyfriend in the passenger's seat. She 
gave Wride her driver's license but Garcia-Juearegui gave the officer a 
false name.

Wride went 
back and forth between the pick-up truck registered to Grunwald's mother
and his squad car three times, trying to figure out Garcia-Juaregui's 
actual identity.

It was 
while sitting in his squad car that Garcia-Juaregui opened the rear 
window of the truck's cab and started shooting at the officer and his 
girlfriend sped off.

Wride died and his body wasn't found until 45 minutes later when another deputy was sent out to check up on him.

Fellow deputy Greg Sherwood tracked the couple's truck down around 3pm and attempted to pull the couple over.

But
 Grunwald wouldn't stop, and actually 'aggressively applied the brakes' 
to shorten the distance between the two vehicles while her boyfriend 
started shooting.

Mourning: Family, friends and fellow police officers attend the funeral of Cory Wride in Spanish Ford Cemetery on February 5

Garcia-Juregui
 hit Sherwood in the head, critically injuring the officer. Sherwood 
eventually recovered from the injury and returned home Tuesday after 
spending 19 days in the hospital.

After hitting Sherwood, the couple hit
 another roadblock when their truck crashed after hitting spikes laid on
 the road near Nephi, Utah. 

Instead
 of surrendering to police, Grunwald helped flagged down a minivan and 
her boyfriend carjacked the vehicle from a woman who was on her way home
 from a parent-teacher conference.

This
 is just one of the instances prosecutors are using to argue that 
Grunwald was not being forced by her boyfriend to take part in the crime
 spree.

After abandoning the
 truck, prosecutors say Grunwald 'on her own accord, follows Mr 
Garcia-Juaregui after leaving the vehicle without appearing to be 
coerced by him'.

Police allege Grunwald was high on meth when she
 and her boyfriend shot and killed a sheriff's deputy who was trying to 
help them with car trouble last mont. She is seen here at a court appearance in February

The couple didn't get far with the hijacked car and crashed again on a second strip of spikes. 

After hitting the spikes, police say Grunwald crossed into traffic and tried to strike another vehicle on purpose. 

Juab County sheriff's deputies were finally able to stop the couple when they shot Garcia-Juaregui in the head. While he was lying on the ground, Grunwald yelled at officers: 'You f****** shot him'.

A trial will be scheduled at a June 2 
hearing.

Attorneys say they expect the trial will take about three weeks
 and will be scheduled for late summer or early fall of this year.
