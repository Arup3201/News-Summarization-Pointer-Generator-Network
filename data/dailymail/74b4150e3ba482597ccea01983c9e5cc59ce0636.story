A woman who started a fire which killed five people – including three children aged under five – was jailed for 30 years yesterday.

Melanie Smith, 43, set fire to a pushchair in an act of ‘exceptional wickedness’ because she was fed up with it being left outside her flat.

The devastating inferno she started trapped a neighbouring  couple and three young children in a first-floor flat.

Devastation: The fire set by Melanie Smith was hot enough to melt a television, as this picture shows

Tragedy: A young couple, their baby son and their niece and nephew were killed in the fire last October, which left a bedroom wardrobe totally charred

Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her 23-year-old 
partner Liam Timbrell, their baby son, Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers’s
 nephew Bailey, four, and her niece Skye, two, all burned to death.

The 200C blaze was so intense it melted a television and cooker hood in the couple’s first floor flat.

As the fire took hold, Mr Timbrell was
 heard in the background of a 999 call screaming: ‘Oh my God, oh my God,
 we’re going to die.’

Despite being badly burned, he managed
 to tell police that, moments earlier, he had heard Smith, a 
mother-of-five, shouting through their letterbox: ‘I’m going to burn 
your house down.’

Mr Timbrell and Charlie died later in hospital. 

Miss Shiers, Bailey and Skye, who were
 the children of Miss Shiers’s brother Steve Allen, 28, and were 
sleeping over for the night, perished in a bedroom.

Jobless Smith, who lived in the flat below, was convicted of five counts of murder last month.

Yesterday a judge handed down five life sentences and told her she would serve a minimum of 30 years.

Mr Justice Griffith-Williams said: 
‘The setting fire to the pushchair was an act of exceptional wickedness,
 almost unparalleled in its consequences.

‘For those who had to hear the 
evidence of the 999 calls, the horror of those moments in the flat 
upstairs as Lee-Anna and Liam faced the awful inevitability of their 
imminent deaths will be forever etched on their memories.’

Mold Crown Court was told that Smith, 
who was in a difficult relationship with Steven Clarkson, 45, who 
cheated on her, was ‘bitterly resentful’ of Miss Shiers and Mr 
Timbrell’s happy partnership.

She had repeatedly rowed with Miss 
Shiers over Charlie’s pushchair being left in a communal hallway of the 
flats, in Prestatyn, North Wales, as well as the couple making noise 
upstairs.

Smith had also accused Miss Shiers of 
having a sexual relationship with Mr Clarkson, an allegation, the court 
heard, for which there was ‘no basis at all’.

On one occasion Smith, a heavy 
drinker, is alleged to have told Miss Shiers: ‘I will set your house on 
fire with you and your kids in.’

Seven weeks later, on October 19 last 
year, she carried out the threat.

The court was read a victim impact 
statement from Jonty Lewis, 29, the mother of Skye and Bailey, who said 
her heart had been ‘torn apart’ by the deaths.

‘When I wake up in the morning, that 
first minute is beautiful,’ she said.

‘In those 60 seconds I feel no 
pain and I’m just listening for the laughter and footsteps running 
across the landing in the hope that my bedroom door will fly open and 
they will come bouncing in, jump onto the bed so that I can smother them
 in kisses. It is then that reality sets in. My heart is wrenched and 
the heavy empty feeling engulfs me.

Poignant: This picture frame in the living room which appears to contain the word 'Baby' was melted

Disaster: The fire destroyed most of the building, with the furniture in the living room wrecked

Fury: The arson attack, leaving the stairs looking like a bomb site, stemmed from a disagreement over a pram

Ruin: The kitchen was almost unrecognisable despite its fire prevention measures

‘I realise that I will never hold my 
children’s hands again, teach them to ride a bike. The “normal” things a
 parent should be allowed to do.’

Smith denied setting the fire and even
 admitted when she took the stand that the killer was ‘beyond evil’. But
 it later emerged that she had a history of cruelty to her own children,
 three of whom she abandoned as toddlers.

Her ex-husband, Paul Smith, 51, said 
Smith stubbed cigarettes out on her baby son’s forehead, hacked off her 
toddler daughter’s blonde hair, scalded her with boiling water and 
locked her in an understairs cupboard as punishment.

‘She destroyed my family years ago, 
and by setting fire to that house she’s ruined the lives of so many 
other people,’ he said. ‘It’s horrific. That evil woman deserves to rot 
in hell.’

One of Smith’s daughters, Charlotte, 
now 23 and a mother of one, added: ‘It shocked me to know what she’d 
done, but it’s not out of character.

‘She was a mother from hell to me – 
and she still is. Spending the rest of her life in prison won’t come 
close to what she deserves.’
