Mr Cameron said he wanted to ensure Jews continued to feel safe in the UK

David Cameron this morning insisted Britain is a safe place for Jews to live - and vowed to keep it that way.

The Prime Minister said the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was right to demand security against anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, but insisted British Jews were proud to call the UK home.

Mr Cameron's remarks came after Mr Netanyahu said that Europe was no longer safe for Jews following the terror attacks in Paris and Copenhagen. 

He called for mass emigration to Israel - claiming it is the only country in the world where Jews are totally safe.

A Number 10 spokesman insisted Britain was safe for Jews. The spokesman said: ‘As the Israeli Prime Minister has said today, Jewish people deserve security in every country.

‘And Prime Minister David Cameron could not be clearer. We will fight anti-Semitism with everything we have got.

‘Together we will make sure Britain remains a country that Jewish people are proud to call home – today, tomorrow and for every generation to come.’

Mr Cameron's remarks came after tens of thousands of Danes gathered at memorials around the country last night, commemorating the victims of deadly attacks on a synagogue and an event promoting free speech.

A torch-lit manifestation in Copenhagen this evening attracted a large crowd, including Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and political leaders from fellow Nordic countries.

Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, 22, opened fire on a cafe in hosting a free speech debate on Saturday, killing 55-year-old film director Finn Nørgaard, and attacked a synagogue, shooting 37-year-old Dan Uzan, who was volunteering as a security guard at a Bat Mitzvah.

El-Hussein was later killed in a shootout with police in his neighborhood of Norrebro, a largely immigrant part of the Copenhagen.

The shootings - which came after the Paris gun attacks - sparked Mr Netanyahu's call for mass emigration to Israel. 

But European leaders reacted angrily to Mr Netanyahu's suggestion that Jews were not safe outside Israel.

His comments were attacked by the leaders of France, Germany and Denmark, and were met with fury from Jewish groups.

French President Francois Hollande said. 'I will not just let what was said in Israel pass, leading people to believe that Jews no longer have a place in Europe and in France in particular.' 

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her government is doing everything possible to protect Jewish sites.

She said: 'We are glad and thankful that there is Jewish life in Germany again,' Merkel said in Berlin. 'And we would like to continue living well together with the Jews who are in Germany today.' 

The chair of Britain's Parliamentary committee against anti-Semitism, John Mann, also attacked Mr Netanyahu's remarks.

He said: 'Mr Netanyahu made the same remarks in Paris - it's just crude electioneering. It's no coincidence that there's a general election in Israel coming up.

'The comments are not helpful and I think people will ignore them...We're not prepared to tolerate a situation in this country or in any country in Europe where any Jews feel they have to leave.'

But he added: 'But if people make a positive choice to move then that's their right to do so.'

Mr Netanyahu's renewed call for a modern-day exodus came just hours after the deadly terror attacks in Copenhagen and one month after four hostages were killed at a Paris kosher deli

'We know there are doubts, questions across the community,' French President Francois Hollande said as he reacted with shock and anger to Netanyahu's comments.

France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls also slammed Netanyahu's comments, telling 475,000 French Jews the whole nation was 'wounded with you' after a gunman killed two people including a synagogue security guard in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Mr Valls criticised Netanyahu's plea for mass migration - and questioned its timing just a month before Mr Netanyahu seeks re-election to the Israeli Parliament on March 17.

The French Prime Minister said: 'My message to French Jews is the following: 'France is wounded with you and France does not want you to leave'.'

'I regret Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks. Being in the middle of an election campaign doesn't mean you authorise yourself to make just any type of statement... The place for French Jews is France.'

A Jew who leaves France is a piece of France that is gone,' he later added.

Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt also expressed support for the Jewish community, telling reporters: 'They belong in Denmark, they are a strong part of our community, and we will do everything we can to protect the Jewish community in our country.'

'The Jewish community have been in this country for centuries. They belong in Denmark, they are part of the Danish community and we wouldn't be the same without the Jewish community in Denmark,' she added.

Mr Netanyahu's comments also triggered an angry response from Copenhagen's chief rabbi, Jair Melchior, who said he was 'disappointed' by the remarks.

'People from Denmark move to Israel because they love Israel, because of Zionism. But not because of terrorism,' he said. 'If the way we deal with terror is to run somewhere else, we should all run to a deserted island,' he added.

More than 80 per cent of the world's Jews live in the U.S. and Israel but there are large communities elsewhere, including in Canada, Britain, France, Russia, Argentina, Germany and Australia.

British senior Labour party backbencher Louise Ellman also criticised the Israeli leader's remarks.

Mrs Ellman - one of the most prominent Jewish MPs in Parliament - said: 'I disagree with what he has said...It is the responsibility of all governments to look after their citizens and that includes Jewish citizens.'

A spokesperson for Britain's Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis told MailOnline he would not be giving an immediate response to Netanyahu's comments as he is currently attending a conference.

The terror suspect believed to have killed two men in separate shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Valentine's Day was shot dead by police at around 5am on Sunday after a dramatic standoff.
