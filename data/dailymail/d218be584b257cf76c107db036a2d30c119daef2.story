Laura Lyons, 29, created website Are They Safe, which runs comprehensive searches on people, after she found out her husband had a history of violence against previous partners

A woman who was unaware her new husband had a history of violence against previous partners has set up a website offering £200 background checks to try to stop others suffering a similar fate.

The website, called ‘Are They Safe’, is thought to be the first of its kind, with its founders offering to undertake comprehensive searches of public records to verify someone’s identity, marital history, finances, and uncover any criminal convictions.

Anyone worried about a prospective or current partner, a potential son or daughter-in-law or a business partner, can pay a fee and be supplied with a report of the kind usually compiled by private detectives at much greater cost.

But there have been warnings that the new site goes much further than the ‘Clare’s Law’ checks for domestic violence currently available to police, and could be used by people embarking on anonymous ‘fishing expeditions’ to uncover information that could be used maliciously. 

AreTheySafe.co.uk has been created by Devon businesswoman Laura Lyons, 29, together with experienced investigators and private security specialists.

Ms Lyons had been the victim of violent domestic abuse at the hands of her husband, Farouk Ali, before she left him last year. When she married Ali, Ms Lyons was unaware he had abused previous partners and had two assault convictions.

And in September, he pleaded guilty to bigamy, saying he had another wife in Bangladesh.

‘If something like this service had been available to me, I would have avoided years of violence and misery,’ Ms Lyons said.

But Professor Liz Kelly of London Metropolitan University, an expert in the field of domestic violence, said the numbers of women who would be helped might be limited.

She said: ‘If you’ve fallen for someone, you may not want to check them out at an early stage. I’m not convinced enough people will use it for it to be truly preventative.’ 

She said there could also be privacy issues, while if a former perpetrator had successfully undergone a ‘perpetrator programme’ to modify his or her behaviour, disclosing their past would be unfair to them. 

She added: ‘I also have concerns that victims will come to be seen as responsible for stopping violence – that makes me uncomfortable.’ 

The information supplied by Are They Safe is derived from legal, subscription-only databases of the sort used by private investigators and insurance companies. For £195, the site offers to verify an individual’s personal information, marital details, criminal history and will also reveal any credit warnings or county court judgments against them.

An ‘enhanced background check’ costing £350 involves further financial checks, disclosure of current and previous company directorships, and property ownership. It will even reveal if the subject of the search appears on international lists of wanted criminals and terrorists.

Some of this information is already available to prospective partners via the police, under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, known as ‘Clare’s Law’ because it was introduced after Salford woman Clare Wood was murdered by her partner, George Appleton, in 2009.

However, Avon and Somerset Assistant Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe, the national police lead on domestic violence, admitted yesterday that Clare’s Law searches usually take weeks. Are They Safe promises results within a single week, a period which it says will soon be cut to 24 hours.

There are concerns that the site could be used for anonymous ‘fishing expeditions’ to uncover information that could be used maliciously

Ms Rolfe said: ‘Are They Safe appears to offer a similar service [to DVDS] at a significant cost when disclosure through DVDS is free.’ 

But she added that she did not wish to criticise the new service, adding: ‘Victim safety is our absolute priority.’

Ms Lyons said many people felt wary about using Clare’s Law, as it requires someone to go to a police station in person and make a statement to an officer.

Are They Safe is not only available to people in or thinking about entering a relationship, but could be used by suspicious relatives, neighbours or friends. 

The website asks: ‘How well do you know your partner or potential partner’s past? Are you worried about your son or daughter’s new partner? Is something not adding up? Are they who they say they are? Have they ever been convicted of a criminal offence? Do they have a record of domestic violence? We will uncover this for you.’

Ms Lyons accepted that some clients would not be able to afford the fees, but said she hoped to introduce a ‘heavily subsidised’ service for people on low incomes and benefits. She said: ‘I don’t want anyone to be excluded. I’m not doing this to make money, but because I want to prevent people becoming victims.’

However, Hazel Blears, the Labour MP who led the campaign for Clare’s Law, said she feared it might allow people to go on ‘fishing expeditions’ which undermined a person’s right to privacy.

She added: ‘I would also be concerned if people were accessing their partners’ details without the necessary support being in place.’ This was because if a check persuaded someone they ought to leave their partner, ‘the point when a relationship ends is also the point of maximum risk’.

According to a Home Office study published in 2006, almost 70 per cent of domestic violence perpetrators held by police have been arrested before.

In cases where clients are shown to be at serious risk, Are They Safe will also provide advice on security, and on working with police. ‘We will provide exactly the kind of support Hazel Blears is talking about,’ Ms Lyons said.

London student Joanne, 28, last week became one of the first to use Are They Safe. 

Of her partner, she said: ‘He didn’t like me using social network websites, and he didn’t like my job. He’d insist on holding my phone. I decided to check him out.’

She learned he had been charged with rape and convicted of assault. ‘It explained a lot,’ Joanne said.

She left him, and within days he started to text her death threats. 

On Are They Safe’s advice, she went to police. He was not arrested, but the threats have stopped, for now.
