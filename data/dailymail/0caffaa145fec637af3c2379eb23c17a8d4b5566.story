Forget soap and water - these days, women are ditching flannels in favour of electric face brushes to help give skin a super-deep clean. First on the scene, in 2009, was the £150 Clarisonic, but since then the market has exploded.

Now, every major skincare brand, from Boots' No7 to Mary Kay, has their own. Last month, budget store Lidl announced a £9.99 version - including a year's worth of replacement heads (most manufacturers suggest replacing heads every three months, or when bristles become worn).

While features vary, broadly speaking, there are two technologies: vibrating and rotating. There's no independent research to suggest one technology is superior, and most experts agree that, in general, all face brushes can be good for skin.

Beauty ritual: Most experts agree that, in general, all face brushes can be good for skin

'Face brushes make a ritual of cleansing, which can mean women are more likely to cleanse thoroughly,' says Dr Sam Bunting, a Harley Street cosmetic dermatologist. 'Used correctly, they can help remove more surface dirt than manual cleansing, meaning the products you use penetrate better.'

Devotees claim they leave skin more toned and radiant, but Dr Bunting warns they need to be used with care: 'There is the potential for over-cleansing, damaging the skin, and they can even cause breakouts. It's about using it when your skin needs it, with an appropriate cleanser, such as Cetaphil, that won't over-dry your skin.'

So, with Dr Bunting’s help, we compared some of the newest electric face brushes on the market, costing from under £10 to £155...

Clarisonic Aria

Sophisticated technology:  The Clarisonic Aria

£155, clarisonic.co.uk

HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacements cost from £35 for two. A range of types, including deep-pore cleansing, are available.

HOW IT WORKS: The market leader (with price to match), it oscillates 300 times a second. The timer has a one-minute cycle, which beeps at 20, 40 and 50 seconds to remind you to change area, and a two-minute cycle. Fully charged (via the magnetic USB charger), it lasts around 28 minutes.

WATERPROOF? Yes.

VERDICT: Clarisonic brushes have the most sophisticated technology and their claims are supported by most research.

This latest brush feels like a premium product: weighty and substantial. That said, I think you're paying for a brand name. I'm not convinced it cleans three times better than its £50 lookalike.

'I like the timer function,’ says Dr Bunting. ‘It’s very precise and anything that mitigates a tendency for overuse is a good thing, though I’m not convinced anyone needs to be using anything other than the gentlest head.’

Foxnovo 5 in 1 Electric Face and Body Cleaner

From £6.08, amazon.co.uk

HEADS INCLUDED: One brush, one sponge, one latex, one pumice, one massager.

HOW IT WORKS: A battery-powered brush head rotating in one direction. No timer.

WATERPROOF? No.

VERDICT: This felt cheap. The bristles were scratchy, the head wobbled and the other heads felt either ineffective, or downright dangerous. 'Lots of women are inclined to equate that squeaky-clean feeling with taking care of their skin when, actually, it can indicate that you've damaged the skin's barrier function,' says Dr Bunting.

'The heads with this gadget mean there’s potential for abuse: some look more suited to woodwork than skincare.'

Clinique Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush

£79, clinique.co.uk

HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacements cost £20.

HOW IT WORKS: This two-tone brush vibrates rather than rotates. Clinique advises using the soft, white bristles on the cheeks for 15 seconds, and the firm, green bristles on the T-zone for 15 seconds.

A built-in timer stops movement after 30 seconds. It charges via a stand with a USB cable, and a full charge lasts 180 minutes.

WATERPROOF? Yes.

VERDICT: For the price, this didn't deliver. The design was unimpressive and the stand isn't waterproof, so you can’t keep it in the bathroom. Basically, it vibrates - the whole unit, not just the head.

'I'm not convinced that different bristles are necessary,' says Dr Bunting. 'You're not getting into the pores, just removing the top layer of make-up and dead skin cells. This didn't seem to have much cleaning power. I don’t think you’ll do any harm with it, but it’s not the best out there.'

Cheaper choice: Olay claim their product works as well as the Clarisonic

Olay Regenerist Cleansing Kit

£20, amazon.co.uk

HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacements cost £9.99 for two.

HOW IT WORKS: Battery-powered brush head rotates up to 350 times a minute. Two speeds. No timer, but Olay advises moving it around the face for one minute.

WATERPROOF? Yes.

VERDICT: When Olay launched this brush in the U.S., it claimed its study showed it cleaned as effectively as the Clarisonic.

Clarisonic later disputed the manner in which the tests had been conducted. However, Olay is the only budget brand publishing any research.

This felt gentle enough. If you want to use it with your regular cleanser (it's sold with Olay's own), search Olaz (the name for Olay in Germany) on Amazon and buy the brush alone for around £17.

'A waterproof model at this end of the budget is a definite plus point,' says Dr Bunting. 'I'd like a timer, but it’s a good option.'

Sanitas Cleansing Brush

£9.99, Lidl

HEADS INCLUDED: Three. Replacements cost £7.50 for two, including shipping from Germany.

HOW IT WORKS: Battery-powered brush with two modes: spinning and oscillating. No timer.

WATERPROOF? No.

VERDICT: This won't win any prizes for looks, and the bristles splayed so easily, I can't imagine they'd last the four months they claim. Not the best budget option.

'The distinction between the two modes - rotating, for a gentle cleanse, and oscillating, for a thorough cleanse - is pointless,' says Dr Bunting. 'With no timer, people could be more inclined to use it for too long.' 

Budget buy: Lidl's version is just £9.99 and the bristles splayed easily

Magnitone Lucid Facial Brush

£49.99, lookfantastic.com

HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacement heads cost £15.99 for two. A sensitive version and one for the body are available.

HOW IT WORKS: Uses a pulsing - or vibrating - technology, charges via a magnetic system and, fully charged, lasts around 28 minutes.

Magnitone recommends using for 20 seconds each on the forehead, nose and chin, and ten seconds on each cheek. It beeps every 20 seconds and stops after one minute.

WATERPROOF? Yes.

VERDICT: Although the design and magnetic charger look like the Clarisonic, this is smaller and lighter, and moves only 10,000 times a minute, compared with the Clarisonic's 18,000.

Without evidence that twice the movements makes for twice as good cleansing, I thought it a decent alternative.

However, Dr Bunting wasn’t impressed: ‘I’m really concerned about their claim that this can stimulate collagen production.

'I don't think you should be using cleansing to do that, and telling people they should be using it twice a day to get this result could tempt women with wrinkles and delicate skin to overuse it, upsetting the barrier function of the skin, and causing more damage.' 

M&S Radiant Cleanse Facial Cleansing Brush

£19.50, marksandspencer.com

HEADS INCLUDED: One. Replacement heads cost £6.

HOW IT WORKS: A battery-powered brush that spins in one direction. No timer, but the manufacturer advises moving across the face in gentle movements for between 30 seconds and a minute.

WATERPROOF? No.

VERDICT: The brush was soft but, as with all rotating brushes, I felt it dragged the skin round the eyes more than the vibrating brushes.

'This is a good budget option,' says Dr Bunting, 'but not being able to use it in the shower marks it down. Although they advise a time limit, without a built-in timer, it would be too easy to overuse.' 

Expensive option: Philips VisaPure is £150

Philips VisaPure

£150, philips.co.uk

HEADS INCLUDED: Two (one normal, one sensitive). A range of replacements, including an exfoliating one, start at £8 for one.

HOW IT WORKS: A brush with two speeds that rotates in one direction while vibrating. Philips suggests cleansing the T-zone and both cheeks for 20 seconds each.

It pauses every 20 seconds and turns off after a minute. The charger plugs into a storage cradle: a full charge lasts 30 minutes.

WATERPROOF? Yes.

VERDICT: This is comfortable, but looks odd and is easy to turn off accidentally. It's the most expensive rotating brush here and the only rechargeable (rather than battery-powered) one. I like it, but I think you pay for the design and stand.

'Their research shows it cleanses ten times better than manual cleansing,' says Dr Bunting.

'The timer will prevent overuse. As with any brush, I'd recommend gradually introducing it to your regime, and less use in winter.'
