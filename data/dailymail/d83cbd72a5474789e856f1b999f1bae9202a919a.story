Bernard Hopkins was born nine years before the Rumble in the Jungle, the 40th anniversary of which Muhammad Ali and George Foreman celebrated last week.

Hopkins took time out from a fledgling career of mugging grown-ups and being stabbed three times himself in the crime-ridden streets of Philadelphia to watch film of the legalised fist fight beamed into US cinemas from distant Zaire.

Just eight troubled years after Ali famously knocked out the hitherto indestructible Foreman, Hopkins was sentenced to 18 years in jail for nine felony convictions.

Hopkins' victory over Shumenov was his 55th in a career that has seen him fight 65 times

Upon being paroled six years later, at the age of 23, he replied to a taunt from the prison warden who predicted he would see him again soon by saying: ‘I ain’t ever coming back here.’

Hopkins had identified boxing as the means for reforming his life. Now it appears he has discovered the secret of eternal youth.

In Atlantic City on Saturday night Hopkins will contest the 66th fight of his seemingly ever-lasting career.

Already, at 49, he is boxing’s oldest world champion of all time. If he wins in the Boardwalk Hall this coming weekend he will be a reigning world champion when he turns 50 on January 15.

But not for him a soft-touch opponent to help him make more history.

At this age when many sportsmen are reaching for the carpet slippers and regaling their grandchildren with tales of glories past, Hopkins is taking on one of the most devastating punchers in the hardest of all games.

Not for nothing is Sergey Kovalev nicknamed Krusher. 

Nathan Cleverly, who lost his world title when he was flattened by the Russian knockout machine in Cardiff 15 months ago, testifies: ‘This man has serious power. He hits harder than anyone I’ve fought. I fear he will stop Hopkins and end his career.’ 

Hopkins has re-styled himself as The Alien as a testament to his ability to box into his 50th year

Kovalev has only one minor blip on his record – a technical draw. Of his 25 victories, all but two have been inflicted inside the distance and only two others went beyond the fourth round.

Yet Hopkins has hand-picked this menace for this iconic moment, in which he intends adding Kovalev’s WBO light-heavyweight title to the WBA and IBF belts which he already wears around his fat-free waist and six-pack stomach.

Alright, we have heard plenty down these remarkable years about the clean-living, strict dieting, hard-training regime to which Hopkins adheres, not only when preparing for fights but every day of his life.

OK, he rarely if ever weighs more than a pound or two above the 12-and-a-half stone light-heavyweight limit and forswears hard liquor, cigarettes and late nights.

But Kovalev?

Hopkins will soon be half a century old, for heaven’s sake. The Krusher is 21 years his junior.

And yet, and yet...

When this match was made the first instinct of most of us, like Cleverly, was to start praying Hopkins would not be badly hurt.

And yet... this is not only the oldest but the wiliest of world champions.

Kovalev has proved himself to be one of the hardest hitters in boxing 

And while he talks about his Spartan lifestyle keeping him young, he has to have an intellectual reason for choosing Kovalev.

The alternative was an equally big-money battle with another mighty puncher, one of whose victims is coming up to a battle of Britain rematch with Cleverly in Liverpool on November 22.

Adonis Stevenson made almost as short work of Tony Bellew as Kovalev did of Cleverly and Hopkins was close to agreeing a unification fight with Canada’s WBC champion.

So why, all of a sudden, Kovalev?

Hopkins, talkative man though he is, keeps his counsel. Adonis also spells danger but Hopkins prefers the Krusher.

Could it be he has worked out that Kovalev is the inferior technical boxer of the two and less likely, also, to have the patience to unravel the defensive labyrinth and complex traps which Hopkins will bring to the argument?

It is reasonable to suspect as much.

Oscar De La Hoya, the president of Golden Boy promotions in which Hopkins is a stakeholder, suggests that his business partner is ‘more powerful, just as fast and even more clever’ than back when he dubbed himself The Executioner.

Hopkins has changed his nickname to The Alien and Kovalev says: ‘I’m going to hit him so hard I will send him back to Mars.’

Cleverly was in a bad way when he was stopped in the fourth round by the hard-hitting Russian

Six years ago, shortly before he retired, our own legend Joe Calzaghe outpointed the older and seemingly ageing Hopkins. He marvels that the man is still boxing and says: ‘Kovalev will have to catch Bernard if he is to make his power count. Although I have to say it will be hard for a 49-year-old to keep away from trouble for the full 12 rounds.’

Don’t bet against Hopkins doing it.

Don’t count out another miracle of the aged, another blow on behalf of the grey community.

Don’t write off the prospect of one more mesmerising, time-defying victory by decision for the grand old man of the ring.

Fifty is a dangerous age. But for whom?

Hopkins v Kovalev will be televised live on BoxNation late Saturday night.

We are asked to believe that the proprietors of strip clubs in Las Vegas have requested that the local cops help them ban Floyd Mayweather.

This is the unlikeliest story of the week.

The allegation is that some pole dancers were upset at being molested by the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.

Now while Mayweather is no angel, this one smacks of the ridiculous.

Check out the video of him on one of those nights out with the lads. He is there to be observed throwing hundred dollar bills at those naked bodies like so much confetti.

So affronted are the girls by all that harassment that they can be seen… smiling broadly.

The first meeting of Ricky Hatton and Kostya Tszyu since their world title epic nine years ago has provided on object lesson in manners to today’s aspiring champions.

The Hitman is in Sydney promoting one of his stable of fighters, Sergey Rabchenko, in next week’s light-middleweight title eliminator against former three-time world champion Anthony Mundine.

Hatton and Tszyu, the formidable Russo-Aussie he forced to relinquish his world light-welterweight title by retiring at the end of the 11th round in the Manchester Arena, embraced each other warmly.

Both recalled the punishing ferocity of their clash, Hatton saying: ‘This second meeting is a lot less painful than when we hit each other with so many heavy shots.’

Tszyu, who retired at the end of the greatest victory in Hatton’s career and is now a Moscow businessman, said: ‘Thank you, Ricky, for making me realise I had to find something in my life other than boxing.’

Hatton added: ‘It was a wonderful fight but the way we conducted ourselves was just as important.’

Gentlemen of the ring circa 2014, please take note.

Another rival for the attention of the combat sport audience arrives on Channel 5 on Sunday week, November 16.

As the Ultimate Fighting Championship continues to expand outside the US, so Bellator promotions invade the UK market with a show which features a battle between mixed martial art legends Tito Ortiz and Stephan Bonnar.

Channel 5 is the only terrestrial TV outlet for boxing in this country. So the old game will be listening carefully when Bellator chief executive Scott Coker says ‘we will become a fixture for MMA fans in the UK.’

But so will Dana White of the UFC, currently the Octagon’s main counter-attraction to the prize-ring.
