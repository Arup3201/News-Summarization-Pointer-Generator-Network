We spoke yesterday about our last-wicket pair frustrating the Indians for maybe half an hour, so to manage three hours was pretty special.

It felt like we were watching Test history unfold and to watch Jimmy Anderson, who had never scored a first-class 50, make 81 was amazing.

He’s been working on his batting with our assistant coach Paul Farbrace and I can’t talk highly enough of the way he played here.

Superstition: Stuart Broad and his England team-mates were afraid to move from their seats on the balcony as James Anderson and Joe Root put on a record-breaking last-wicket stand of 198 at Trent Bridge

Cricketers are a superstitious lot, so we decided at the start of the day that we weren’t going to move from our seats at all. The only exception was for toilet breaks but even then the pressure was on.

You’re allowed to nip out to the gents but only if you’re back in time for the start of the next over. I’ve been in that situation before, where someone doesn’t make it back in time and then gets blamed if a wicket falls.

The pressure of being an international sportsman comes in all shapes and sizes.

Game changer: Joe Root's unbeaten 154 turned the match in England's favour though they were unable to turn the screw further with the ball later on

We saw when India’s last pair added 111 how easy it is to bat on this pitch, even if you’re a tail-ender and especially when the ball goes old and there’s no bounce in the surface.

We saw Jimmy reaching 50 by charging India’s opening bowler and hooking him in front of square, which just highlighted how poor this surface has been for Test cricket.

In the end, Jimmy was probably unlucky that his nick carried to slip. I can’t have been the only one in the ground who thought he might have been on his way to a maiden Test hundred!

Batting

I’ve worked really hard on my batting since I got back from Australia and it’s really pleasing that it seems to be paying off. Paul has played a big part and he’s encouraged me to be attacking.

I remember reading Michael Vaughan say he always looked for a four early on and that’s what I’m trying to do. I’ve added a little trigger movement too and feel like I’ve got time to hit through the ball.

Collapses

It does seem over the past year we’ve been prone to some collapses and it’s something we have to improve. It’s a collective effort and there’s no blame involved because the bowlers are part of the batting effort too.

My knee

With so many tests squeezed into such a short space of time anyone with half a cricket brain understands rotation could be on the agenda.

Hopefully the knee will be OK but let’s be honest, if we keep bowling 160 overs an innings then none of the bowlers will get through the series.

Staying at home

It’s nice to be able to wake up in my own bed and it’s always special playing at your home ground. It’s definitely more friendly than Brisbane!
