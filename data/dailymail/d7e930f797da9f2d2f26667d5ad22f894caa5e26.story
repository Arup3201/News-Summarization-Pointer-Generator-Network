The family of a woman whose casket was dropped outside her funeral causing her body to spill onto the pavement has received an $80,000 settlement.

Family of 67-year-old Ellnora James recalled the moment in late 2010 in gruesome detail after they say funeral workers in Grand Rapids, Michigan dropped the woman's body just before the service was to take place.

Ivy K. Gillespie Funeral Home denied the woman's body having ever fallen out but several family members speaking toÂ WOOD-TV said that wasn't the case, and they have a large settlement check now to show for it.

Scene: Family of Mrs James said her casket fell from a hearse outside this funeral home in Grand Rapids Michigan, causing her body to roll onto the pavement

Those family members, not listed as plaintiffs among Mrs James' eight children on the lawsuit, recalled the casket being pulled out from the hearse when it fell, breaking open and spilling the woman's body onto the ground.

Speaking to Wood-TV, they said some of the embalming fluid used to treat her body spilled out onto her clothes. Her glasses they said were also never found.

Her son Dean Libbett said he knew something was up without anyone telling him what had happened when the funeral home's staff contacted his family asking for new clothes for her.

Family members also said they noticed she wasn't in the casket they had selected for her.

Apology: The funeral home, pictured, denied the woman having fallen but agreed to pay the $80,000 settlement while sending their apologies

Upon further inspection, they described her as looking 'slumped' inside and the staff acting strange.

'This is the last time you get to show your respects for your loved ones,' Mr Libbett told WOOD-TV.

'There was no respect and there was no dignity and there was no remorse for what happened.'

'We truly, truly, truly apologize,' Crystal Whittington, a representative with the funeral home told WOOD-TV adding no further comment due to possible legal constraints.

Family members say it wasn't about the money but her memory and dignity that has been tarnished.

'It's a hurt when you can't help someone you really loved,' Mr Libbett said. 'There's no way to repair it.'
