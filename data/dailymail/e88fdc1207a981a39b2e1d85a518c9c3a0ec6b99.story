At once bold and gentle, colourful and bleak, glittering and fierce, this is an ode to the heart of Harlem.

In a captivating collection of images taken on the streets of New York's forgotten suburbs, Ruben Natal-San Miguel celebrates the fierce character of districts that have yet to be gentrified.

Each shot is coated in colour and salutes the artistic, untouched character of the people.

Puerto Rican by birth, Natal-San Miguel, an architect and photographer, fell in love with New York City when he moved there to study in the 1980s.

Fixating: Ruben Natal San-Miguel has spent eight years taking striking shots of the urban culture of New York's neglected suburbs, celebrating their colourful beauty

Enchanting: On a beach in the Bronx, a street seller holds a carousel of candy floss. Ruben Natal-San Miguel is enraptured by the colours of New York's suburbs

Character: Natal-San Miguel, from Puetro Rico, moved to Harlem from his New York high rise after 9/11 because it felt safer. He has fallen in love with the society

He became enraptured by the 
world-class art scene, and saved for months doing catering jobs until he
 could afford to buy one of the Andy Warhol silk screens hanging in a 
gallery's shop window.

But after the 9/11 attacks, he discovered another invaluable artwork just around the corner: the streets of Harlem.

He moved from his city-centre high rise to the notorious suburb because, to him, it felt safer.

It was a move that would inspire a shining photography career.

Depicting
 the everyday activities and traditions of the less-off New Yorkers, 
Natal-San Miguel has produced hundreds of bewitching images that throw a
 new artistic slant on patriotism.

And he has been applauded for collecting money for the local community using his blog and work with a movement of pop-up artists in the area, Art IN FLUX.

His latest series, Capturing Colorful, Enchanting, and Sassy New York, is part of an exhibition called Nothing Is Colorproof, which opens on December 3 in Aloft Hotel, Harlem, New York.

His work can be viewed alongside six other artists that deal with social dilemmas at Scratch DJ Academy in New York until January 3, 2014.

Vibrant: Natal-San Miguel describes these ladies from Harlem as 'Soul Sistas' as he captures them chatting one afternoon in the street clad in glitter

Divide: His images, which will be displayed from December 3 in Aloft Hotel, Harlem, depict the severe district divides in New York between Manhattan and elsewhere

Culture: A street dancer performs on a Harlem stage for cheering crowds. Natal-San Miguel has spent eight years exploring the area to capture its character

Grooming: His captivating images for Nothing Is Colorproof follow a project called NYC: A Concrete Jungle documenting Harlem before its 'imminent gentrification'

Fancy dress: Natal-San Miguel - an architect, photographer, curator, writer, art collector and consultant - celebrates New Yorkers' tendency to dress up

Halloween: Dressed as a pumpkin, trick-or-treating around New York's neglected suburbs, this little girl looks delighted

Cheer: This little girl with cheerleading pom poms is captured during a summer parade through the street. Exuding confidence, she captures the essence of Harlem

Style: The tattoos and fashion of the people that surround depict a unique congregation that Natal-San Miguel does not want to be obliterated by gentrification

Red, white and blue: It may be a sidelined community but the way the people display their patriotism is beautiful, artful and packed with character

History: This gentle image shows a woman standing in the wake of a march holding a giant picture of Martin Luther King Jr, the man that sparked integration in the US

Vision: This woman, obscured by her dazzling sunglasses, gazes up at the funfair rides on Coney Island

You are on an island.: The divide between the suburbs and wealthy Manhattan is made even more stark with Natal-San Miguel's installation on the river side

Music: People flock to Oxford Beach in the Bronx to spend their days listening to music and sunbathing during the sweltering summer months

'Living Doll': The tough, guarded attitude of this beautiful girl clad in USA sunglasses, a red costume, blue belly ring and blonde hair, is artistically patriotic

Another beach shot shows a bulldog-decorated speaker blasted songs out over the parasol-covered seaside

Angelic: Titled, 'The Newcomers', these girls have the softest, most innocent appearance of all Natal-San Miguel's subjects as they smile sweetly on some Harlem steps

Soul: Another, younger, cheerleader stares fiercely into the camera as she nonchalantly stands out in the middle of the street wearing tassled cowboy boots and a tutu

Playing: Running around in water spraying from the mains in the street, these kids form an elegant composition

Wheelie: Now all the kids of the street are rushing out to make the most of the spurts of water during the height of summer

Frankenstein: Facing off at the camera, this Frankenstein - clutching a plastic pumpkin treats pot - completes his fierce look with some Nike trainers

Bling: Many of Natal-San Miguel's portraits have hidden faces as he captures their embellished features to portray their homegrown culture within their society

Beach babes: Clad in hair nets, halternecks and velour tracksuits, these faceless women represent swathes of similar citizens full of character

Staring out: This woman in a towel is probably fresh out of the sea, and staring back at it. Natal-San Miguel's shots present a fascination with the surrounding water

Shrouded in colour: The exhibition, 'Nothing Is Colorproof', highlights everyone's quirks and colourful embellishments

Rainbow: Under sun, water and a rainbow, this dancing toddler seems to be in a summery paradise - with the everyday street almost visible in the background

Reporting for duty: In a quirky patterned suit, Nike trainers and a cycling helmet, this boy is unique

Stop the violence: This bold sign strapped with bits of string to the railings of a park is a soft but desperate plea to make the streets safer
