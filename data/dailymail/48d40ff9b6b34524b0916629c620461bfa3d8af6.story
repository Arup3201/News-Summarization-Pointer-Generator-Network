Standing firm: Prime Minister David Cameron walks purposefully to a news conference following his decision to veto the amendments

David Cameron has received overwhelming support from British voters over his historic decision to veto changes to the EU Treaty.

The first poll conducted since the acrimonious Brussels summit shows that a total of  62 per cent of people agreed with the Prime Minister’s defiant stance, with just 19 per cent against.

Furthermore, most people believe the euro is doomed to fail and almost half think the EU will break up. They also fear the summit has given too much power to Germany.

If there was a referendum today on whether the UK should quit the EU, is would be likely to produce a resounding Yes. Nearly 50 per cent say we should go our own way, with 33 per cent in favour of staying in.

These figures come as:

Amid the frenetic recriminations following the summit, the poll shows Mr Cameron’s dramatic move to set Britain on a separate course from the other 26 nations in the EU is wholeheartedly endorsed by voters.

The summit triumph has also wiped out Labour’s lead in the opinion polls. Both
 Labour and the Conservatives are now on 35 per cent, with the Lib Dems 
on 14.

According to the exclusive poll for The Mail on Sunday, nearly 
two-thirds of voters believe the new EU initiative, designed to save the 
euro by imposing tough economic controls on bankrupt European countries, is probably a waste of time.

A total of 65 per cent say the euro 
currency is doomed, with fewer than one in five convinced it will 
survive. And there is a clear consensus that the rot is likely to spread
 to the EU institution itself. Almost half of voters say it will 
shatter, with just 29 per cent confident it will stay intact.

The survey also suggests that Mr 
Cameron’s bold stance – hailed as a great triumph by Tory MPs – has 
served to whet the appetite of voters who want him to go further.

Two in three want a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe with just 22 per cent against. Calls for Mr Cameron to press home his advantage and demand that Brussels hands back more powers to London produce an almost identical level of support.

The public are in no doubt that 
despite all the grandstanding by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr 
Cameron came off best in Brussels.

When asked if the Prime Minister had
 done well from the negotiations, more than half agreed. In comparison, 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel scored 44 per cent with Mr Sarkozy 
languishing in third place on 35.

Interestingly, as Britain steps back 
from Europe, there is growing nervousness at the advance of German 
influence in the new-look EU. Seven out of ten say the summit has given 
too much power to Germany – with a mere 13 per cent disagreeing.

Nor is the jittery feeling restricted 
to Britain. Warning of a backlash, an article in leading German 
newspaper Der Spiegel said: ‘We are going to have to put up with a bit 
of Germanophobia.’

Charles Grant, director of the London 
based Centre for European Reform think tank, said: ‘For the first time 
in the history of the EU, the Germans are now in charge.’

David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy slugged it out in a bitter war of words as the Prime Minister made it clear he was determined to veto changes in the EU treaty.

As Mr Cameron stood his ground in a confrontation with the French President and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, angry Mr Sarkozy said: ‘These are unacceptable conditions. We cannot grant you that.’

Mr Cameron protested: ‘But I couldn’t get it through my Parliament even if I signed the treaty.’

With Mrs Merkel nodding in agreement behind him, Mr Sarkozy told the Prime  Minister he had no right to try to block the new treaty, designed to deal with the euro currency crisis, because Britain had kept the pound.

Tension: David Cameron keeps an eye on Nicolas Sarkozy as EU leaders in Brussels pose for the cameras after the talks

‘It has nothing to do with you – you aren’t even in the eurozone,’ said Mr Sarkozy. Mr Cameron replied: ‘I am sticking to  my guns.’

The clash came at a tense meeting between the three most powerful EU leaders at 7pm on Thursday. When Mr Cameron came out of the meeting, he told aides he knew he had an uphill struggle to win concessions to protect the City of London.

But he remained confident that he would be able to win round the rest of the EU leaders when they met for dinner, and later when the talks went into the early hours.

‘Frankly, we were all surprised at how intransigent the French and the Germans were,’ said one source. ‘We had genuinely believed that we would win the concessions for the City of London that we needed.

‘When the last round of talks started, the PM said, “Don’t worry, we can still turn it round.” But Sarkozy was set against it from the start.’

Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel hurled the same allegation at Mr Cameron. Mr Sarkozy reportedly observed: ‘The problem with Britain is that it always wants one foot in, one foot out.’

Mrs Merkel said: ‘I don’t believe David Cameron was ever with us at the table.’

Mr Cameron had to wait until 2.30am on Friday to make his final pitch to the other  26 EU leaders. He told them: ‘We are being incredibly reasonable.

‘We have not brought a list of ten “asks” on the working time directive and other matters. All we want is protection for the City.’

But his words fell on deaf ears. For the final tense session, all officials were ordered to leave the room. However, the leaders were allowed to seek advice from aides in the corridors via email on secure BlackBerry smartphones.

Mr Cameron sent a series of BlackBerry messages to his chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, and his chief Downing Street adviser on Europe, Sir Jon Cunliffe, when complex EU legal issues were raised. One said that things were looking ‘tough’.

By the time the talks ended at 3.30am, it was clear that Mr Cameron had no choice but to do what  he had desperately hoped to avoid: to use Britain’s EU veto for the first time in history.

As he emerged, he told his staff: ‘We cannot sign up to this. They just won’t give in. We always knew it might come to this. So be it.’

With that, the Prime Minister  confirmed to other leaders that he would veto the treaty. He gave a press conference and headed to the British Embassy, where he slept  for little more than an hour before rising at 8.15am on Friday. After his 90-minute sleep, he amazed onlookers by appearing remarkably alert, healthy and good humoured when he returned to the European Council building to pose in the ‘family photo’ of EU leaders.

He breezily laughed off questions about the remark – attributed to an anonymous French diplomat in President Sarkozy’s delegation – that he had behaved ‘like a man at a wife-swapping party who refuses to bring his own wife’.

He said: ‘I have not, and have no plans to, attend any wife-swapping parties.’

The level of tension between the three European leaders was later revealingly demonstrated by a Downing Street aide who cited – as evidence that discussions had remained civil – that the Prime  Minister had been able to ‘share a lift’ with the German Chancellor after the talks.

Another aide joked that during the ‘interminable’ dinner the French and German leaders had been forced to eat ‘hard cheese’.

A British diplomat said: ‘It was not about Cameron showing he had cojones. He never ever wanted to use the veto: he genuinely believed they would see sense. But he had always made it clear that he would use it if he had to.

‘It wasn’t about doing a Maggie Thatcher and wielding the handbag. It was not about caving in to some  of the fringe elements on the Tory Eurosceptic Right. He did it because it was right. He doesn’t make idle threats.’

Before Mr Cameron left Brussels, he found time to reflect further on the strain of the epoch-making events of his longest night since winning power in 2010.

‘It was huge pressure in there. Everyone in that room was against me. I had to stand firm,’ he said.

While Mr Cameron received rave reviews from Tory MPs, Mr Sarkozy’s supporters in France went on the attack. Le Parisien newspaper, which has close links to Mr Sarkozy, said the ‘British position did not surprise many people’, least of all the French President.

‘The script was almost written in advance. Cameron had not even written a speech to defend his point of view. Privately, Nicolas Sarkozy considers unthinkable the possibility of letting the UK prosper without any rule or control.’

Mr Cameron arrived back in the UK at 4pm on Friday – exactly  24 hours after he had left.

On Thursday, before heading for Brussels, Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha watched their son Elwen perform as a mouse in the nativity play at his Kensington primary school, and went for coffee at a French cafe nearby. Samantha then waved her husband goodbye with a simple: ‘Good luck, darling’.
