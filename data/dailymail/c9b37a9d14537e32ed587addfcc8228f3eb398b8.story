A Melbourne woman has proved that a car on a hot summer’s day really can be hot enough to fry an egg.

Actress Katherine Moss incredibly baked cookies, eggs, pasta and grilled cheese successfully on the dashboard of her car on a hot day with frightening results.

The 'car cooking' series has a very important message, indicating that when a child or pet are left in a car on a hot day they are essentially being put in an oven.

‘The message is clear: don’t cook your pet,’ Ms Moss told Daily Mail Australia.

‘It started as a bit of fun but when the food started cooking so well and really quickly I thought “can you imagine a kid or a dog in the car?” It’s nuts to me.’

‘It’s so important for people to realise what happens inside a hot car. Maybe people don’t know and there’s a level of ignorance about just how hot a car becomes.’

Katherine Moss was able to cook spaghetti in a pot of cold water overnight and fry an egg in just an hour

Ms Moss was amazed that the car became so hot that pasta could be cooked in a pot of cold water

The actress is the proud owner of a beautiful pug named Gil and can't believe that people still leave children and animals alone in cars with the window cracked open

According to Kidsafe Victoria: 

On a 29 degree Celsius day a car can reach 44 degrees in just 10 minutes

It will reach a deadly 60 degrees in 20 minutes.

Leaving the window down a few centimetres does little

The smaller the child or animal, the greater the risk. 

A young child will quickly dehydrate, lapse into unconsciousness and may never fully recover. 

The cause is particularly close to the 29-year-old’s heart as she owns a beautiful two-year-old pug named Gil and is often startled when she sees dogs left in cars with the window ajar.

Ms Moss first started by putting a tray of dough on the dashboard, curious about the results.

She was amazed when she had well-cooked cookies in just an hour and a half.

‘The cookies made my car smell amazing so I thought “maybe I should do this more often,”’ Ms Moss laughed.

The same could not be said for the egg and grilled cheese experiments.

‘I had to air my car out after that and was scared I’d develop an ant problem so I think I’m done with car cooking for a little while,’ she said.

However an interesting result was the awful taste of the food cooked by sunlight. 

‘I ate the cookies but I learned quickly not to eat the car food. I didn’t feel very good afterwards!

‘I definitely wouldn’t promote it as an alternative method to cooking. More just as a demonstration,' she joked.

The experiment started as a joke to prove how hot her car became in the Melbourne sun

In just fifteen minutes the chocolate was able to melt and become fondue on the first day of Autumn 

Ms Moss quickly realised that the car was effectively an oven on a hot day. She decided the images could become a powerful way to send an message about the danger of leaving children and pets alone in hot cars

The NIDA-trained actress also quickly learnt the importance of putting down a tea towel when the tray left a melted mark on her dash.

‘I had to use oven mitts because the pans got that hot,’ she said.

In February a 22-month-old boy died when he was left inside a hot vehicle parked on the driveway of a Kyneton daycare centre in Victoria.

Ambulance Victoria would not comment on the case, but had issued repeated warnings against leaving children in cars.

In the first five weeks of 2015 paramedics were called to 200 cases of children overheating in cars. 

The website series has quickly gained interest and Ms Moss was even able to prove that it really can be hot enough to fry an egg in a hot car

Ms Moss couldn't believe that the egg had cooked so well that it was brown when she flipped it

Advanced life support paramedic Ben Dalton said two children have died in the last few years after being left in hot cars in Victoria and says it's frustrating the message isn't getting through. 

'Children can't regulate their body temperature like adults can, which puts them at significant risk,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's never okay to leave a child locked in a car, even for a minute or two.' 

The Victorian state government said it will increase penalties for leaving children in hot cars, with fines up to $3700 and jail time increased from three months to six months.

Ms Moss argues that it is never okay to leave a child or animal unattended, even during the cooler months of the year.

'A typical Australian summer day that we’ve all experienced is sitting in the car and burning yourself with the seatbelt buckle.'

‘But what’s scary is that some of the car cooking days in Melbourne weren't even sunny days, it was just hot.’

Ms Moss herself has a beautiful two-year-old pug named Gil 

Ms Moss was able to grill cheese on the dashboard of a car, but learned to put down a tea towel after the tray left a 'melted' mark on her car

Ms Moss couldn't believe how quickly and thoroughly the cheese melted and the bread became toasted

Ms Moss was also able to cook the eggs and fondue on an autumn day in Sydney, proving that there is a danger of a stuffy car quickly becoming overheated on seemingly cool days.

Within just 15 minutes she had melted chocolate for fondue.

The egg took around an hour, but when Moss flipped the egg she was amazed to find it had already become brown.

The spaghetti was the most astonishing result. The 29-year-old left a pot of cold water and hard spaghetti strands in the car. By morning she had uninviting but nonetheless cooked pasta.

She has quickly gained a following as well as a range of interesting remarks from friends.

‘You’re not living in your car, are you?’ asked a friend.

‘And a car gets you from A to B. So versatile!’ another person mused.

‘Get a stove already,’ another quipped.

‘I don’t understand how people could have a dog and not treat it like a person, like part of the family,' she said

Her car cooking has been referred to as ‘meals-in-wheels’ and her ‘solar oven.’

‘How good! Go to work, finish and get in your car with your meal cooked already! Winning!’ remarked another friend.

However, the realisation that a vehicle can become so intensely hot so quickly is also startling.

‘I still see animals in cars with a cracked window and it baffles me that it still happens in this day and age when there’s enough literature and information about not doing that sort of thing.’

‘I don’t understand how people could have a dog and not treat it like a person, like part of the family.

‘There are no government funded ads to explain what actually happens when children and pets are left in hot cars.

‘It’s tragic when children die in the back of cars. People need to be aware, it needs to be at the forefront of people’s minds.

The first experiment was with cookie dough and was a massive success when they baked in just over an hour

Ms Moss was also impressed when her car smelt delicious thanks to the aroma of baked goods

‘I think these images are powerful because they make an impact without being grotesque or in poor taste.’

The photos, initially intended as a joke, have taken on a life of their own as a way of raising awareness about the reality of a hot car.

‘I think it’s a really good demonstration of what not to do with your children or your pets,’ said Ms Moss.

‘If it helps raise any kind of awareness it’s taken an activity that I did with too much time on my hands and turned it into something quite helpful.’
