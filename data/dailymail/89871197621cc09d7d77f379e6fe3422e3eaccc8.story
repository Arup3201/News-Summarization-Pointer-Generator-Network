The wife of Mick Philpott, who helped her husband set a fire that killed six of their children, is reportedly planning to divorce her husband while they are both still behind bars.

Mairead Philpott, 33, was sentenced to 17 years for manslaughter in 2013 but hopes to be back on the streets in time for her fortieth birthday.

It is understood she has been exchanging romantic letters with Paul Mosely, 47, who was also sentenced to 17 years for his part in the horrific crime.

Mick Philpott married Mairead in 2003 but the jailed couple could be set for divorce after Mairead is reported to have told cellmates she is looking to ditch her husband and start a relationship with Paul Mosely

A source told The Sun's Andrew Parker: 'She wants to see Mosley as soon as they get out. It's a love triangle from hell.

'She's finally realised what a swine Mick is â€” plus he could still be inside for years after she is out.'

 Philpott led the trio in a scheme to get a bigger council house by 
burning down his Derby home and framing ex-lover Lisa Willis for the 
crime.

Paul Mosely, who helped Mick and Mairead Philpott burn down their home, has allegedly started exchanging letters with Mairead. He was sentenced to 17 years for his part in the crime

Tributes were left outside the Derby home where the six children, aged between five and 13, died

The devastation caused by the blaze, it was lit by Philpott in an attempt to get a bigger council house

His intention was to rescue the sleeping children through an upstairs window but the plan went disastrously wrong and the blaze claimed the lives of Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five.

He was sentenced to life behind bars for the vile crime and is currently being held in Wakefield Prison.

The father-of-seventeen, who married Mairead in 2003, used his children to drag in an astonishing Â£60,000 a year in benefits.

Philpott, who had previously been jailed for stabbing his schoolgirl lover 27 times, wove a web of lies trying to get away with the crime and even plotted to 'get rich quick' off generous donations from the local community meant to pay for the funerals of his children.
