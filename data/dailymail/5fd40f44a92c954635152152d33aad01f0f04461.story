If Cristiano Ronaldo has his way, and he so often does, this scene of the overwhelming favourite to win the Ballon d'Or relaxing by the pool on a luxury yacht off Dubai is the calm before the storm.

Ronaldo had a remarkable 2014, even by the Portuguese superstar's standards, but he believes 2015 can be even better.

'It would be a dream if 2015 was like 2014 or even better,' Ronaldo said in an interview published in sports daily As on Saturday.

'Merry Christmas, everyone! May your Christmas be magic and your dreams come true!' Ronaldo posted on social media with his girlfriend Irina Shayk and his family on December 25

Ronaldo says, 'It would be a dream if 2015 was like 2014 or even better,' and that it is possible

Ronaldo told As in an interview published on Saturday that his goals for 2015 are lofty

A second Champions League was among Ronaldo's four titles and he scored an incredible 51 goals in 47 appearances, setting a record of 17 goals for one edition of of Europe's elite club competition along the way as Real secured a record-extending 10th continental crown and the King's Cup.

Since August 2014 he's amassed 34 goals in 27 matches in all competitions, with 25 of those in 14 La Liga matches a Spanish record that puts him on course to smash Lionel Messi's benchmark of 50 in the Spanish domestic competition in 2011-12.

But no, in Ronaldo's world - which at the moment means soaking up sunshine  in the Middle East during La Liga's winter break - there is room for improvement. And it's an achievable goal, he says.

'It is possible to do it because Madrid is always a candidate to win the competitions it is playing in,' added the 29-year-old.

'We have a team spirit that can help us win the most titles possible and we will fight to the death to get them.'

Ronaldo attributed much of Real's recent success to the arrival of coach Carlo Ancelotti, who replaced the divisive Jose Mourinho at the end of the 2012-13 season.

Italian Ancelotti immediately ended Real's 12-year wait for their 10th European title and using the club's millions has built a formidable side that is top of La Liga and one of the favourites to repeat their Champions League success this term.

'The coach has a lot of importance,' Ronaldo told As. 'He is a great trainer and a great person and we are all delighted with him.

'Together we are a united family which will try to improve on the successes of 2014.'

Ronaldo will find out whether he has won a third FIFA World Player of the Year award, and his second in a row, on January 12 when he is up against Argentina captain Messi and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
