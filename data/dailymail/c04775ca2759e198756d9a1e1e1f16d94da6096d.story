A Maryland State Police trooper has been put on administrative suspension after sheriff's deputies responded to a call reporting a naked man drinking at a bar in a barbecue restaurant, authorities said on Wednesday. 

The incident was just one of at least five high profile naked crimes--from a sword-wielding Florida man to a nude bank robber outside Chicago--that have made headlines across America just since last week.

Harford County sheriff's deputies arrived around 11 p.m. on Saturday at the Jarrettsville Pit and located two men who identified themselves as state troopers, reports the Baltimore Sun.

The trooper in question appeared intoxicated and denied that he had been naked, sheriff's deputy spokeswoman Christie Kahler said.

Customers told deputies one of the troopers had pulled off his pants and at one point exposed himself, according to the report. Neither man was charged.

After an internal investigation by the Maryland State Police, one trooper was placed on administrative suspension, state police spokeswoman Elena Russo said.

Neither of the men's names were released.

The incident is under further investigation by the Maryland State Police and the Maryland District Attorney's Office. 

In Arlington, Virginia, Roland Hitchens, 42, was naked and intoxicated when he struck two vehicles and wrecked his motorcycle before fleeing into the woods Friday night around 9:30 p.m., police said.

Police located Hitchens not far from the scene in the suburb of Washington, D.C., and he was taken to a local hospital and treated for minor injuries. 

Hitchens faces several charges including felony hit and run, indecent exposure, drunken driving, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and driving with a revoked license.

The incident is the most recent in a spate involving naked people around the country. 

There appears to be an uptick in crimes committed by nude people, according to media reports as a total of five bizarre nude crimes have made national headlines since late last week.

The past week or so has seen an unusually high number of high-profile arrests of suspects accused of committing crimes in the nude. 

Since late last week, five men have been hauled away from suspected crime scenes looking naked and unafraid.
