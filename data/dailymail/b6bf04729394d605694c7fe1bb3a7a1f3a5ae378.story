AP McCoy landed Thursday’s 250,000 euros Guinness Galway Hurdle on hot favourite Thomas Edison.

The Tony Martin-trained seven-year-old disappointed in the race last summer in atrocious conditions, but having warmed up for a second bid with victory on the Flat at the Curragh, he was a 7-2 market leader on faster ground.

Main man: AP McCoy steered Thomas Edison to victory in the Guinness Galway Hurdle

Winner: Thomas Edison pipped Fergal and Bayan past the post

He joined the front-running Fergal and the well-fancied Bayan rounding the home turn and the three were virtually in line at the top of the short straight.

However, Thomas Edison had more to give than his rivals and after skipping over the final hurdle, he was pushed out to win by three lengths.
