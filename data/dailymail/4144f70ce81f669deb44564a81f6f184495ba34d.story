A Pennsylvania teenager charged with the gruesome murder of a man she met along with her husband through Craigslist has claimed to have killed more than 22 other people across the country in a jailhouse interview.

In the local newspaper piece, Miranda Barbour, 19, claims she will plead guilty to the butchering of Troy LaFerrara, 42, in November in addition to more than 20 victims from Alaska to North Carolina as part of her involvement in a satanic cult.

'I feel it is time to get all of this out. I don't care if people believe me. I just want to get it out,' Barbour told the newspaper for a story published Saturday night.

'When I hit 22, I stopped counting,' she said on the paper's website. She now just wanted to be honest, she said.

Sunbury police Chief Steve Mazzeo told the newspaper that investigators have been in contact with the FBI and law enforcement in several other states.

'From information we gathered and from information gathered from her interview we are seriously concerned and have been in contact with the proper authorities,' Mazzeo said.

Lawyers for the couple did not immediately return messages from The Associated Press left at their offices Saturday night. An FBI spokesman referred questions to its Philly office, but an email message wasn't immediately returned.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Barbour and her husband, 22-year-old Elytte Barbour. Authorities said Miranda Barbour, a petite woman with long brown hair, told investigators she met the 6-foot-2, 278-pound victim after he responded to her Craigslist ad offering companionship for money.

Over the course of the deeply unsettling interview, Barbour claims that she is ready and able to cooperate with authorities to reveal where the bodies are buried.

'I can pinpoint on a map where you can find them,' she said.

Claiming to have been sexually abused at the age of four, Barbour told the Daily Item that she only killed 'bad people' and was brought up in a satanic cult by a man she would not identify after joining them at the age of 13.

Indeed, it was this individual who introduced Barbour to murder - killing a man down an alley in Alaska with a gun.

'It was in an alley and he (the cult leader) shot him,' she said, declining to identify him.

'Then he said to me that it was my turn to shoot him. I hate guns. I don’t use guns. I couldn’t do it, so he came behind me and he took his hands and put them on top of mine and we pulled the trigger. And then from there I just continued to kill.'

During her time in the cult, Barbour claims that at one point she fell pregnant and was subjected to a dangerous 'in-house abortion' by members after they drugged her and tied her to a bed.

Barbour has said that the majority of the murders she committed were in Alaska, but that she has also killed in North Carolina, Texas and California.

After leaving Alaska as a high-ranking member of the satanic cult, Barbour said that she will tell police anything they want to know about the murders.

Asked why she pleaded not guilty to the LaFerrara muder, she replied, 'I didn't want to.'

'When I was at my arraignment and the judge asked me how do I plead, I was ready to say guilty and my attorney (chief public defender Ed Greco) grabbed the microphone and said not guilty.'

Miranda Barbour said she has not spoken with her husband since the day she was arrested.

'He is proud of what he did,' she said. 'I will always love him.'

'I know I will never see my husband again and I have accepted that. I know I wanted to talk about all this because I know I had a 20-year window where I would possibly get out of jail and I don’t want that to happen. If I were to be released, I would do this again.'

Police allege in court papers that Elytte Barbour told investigators they committed the crime because they wanted to kill someone together.

She said in the interview that she doesn't want to get out of jail and that she would kill again if she were released.

These confessions from Barbour follow the graphic details she gave police about married Troy LaFerrara's last moments.

Barbour told police in December that LaFerrara was still alive and 'choking and gasping for air' as her and her husband tried to find somewhere to dump his body after stabbing him 20 times.

Initially, Miranda told police that she killed La Ferrara in self-defense after he started to grope her. But her 22-year-old husband Elytte Barbour gave police a different story, saying they conspired to kill a stranger together, and he helped hold La Ferrara down while his wife wielded the knife.

Miranda Barbour was the first to be arrested when police traced LaFerrara's last call to her cell phone. She was charged last Wednesday in his death, followed by her husband on Friday.

Investigators said Elytte Barbour confessed to police the couple planned the killing. He previously told The Daily Item of Sunbury his wife acted in self-defense when LaFerrara, who was married, groped her after hiring her as a ‘companion.’

According to authorities, Miranda advertised herself as a 'companion' on Craigslist and LaFerrara responded. She arranged to pick him up on November 11 at a mall, three weeks after her marriage.

Elytte Barbour says he hid in the back of the car under a blanket until the moment his wife gave him a signal.

He held LaFerrara back with a cable cord while his petite, bespectacled spouse repeatedly stabbed him. LaFerrara's body was discovered the next morning in an alley by Sunbury resident Brittany Settler.

After dumping their victim's body, the Barbours when to Wal-mart to buy garbage bags, carpet clearer, paper towels and seat covers to clean out the SUV - but it wasn't enough.

'She related that there was a lot of blood and she wasn't able to get it all,' police said.

After that they went to a strip club to celebrate Elytte's 22nd birthday.

The Barbours had recently moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot October 22.

LaFerrara married his girlfriend of eight years, Colleen Keeney, in June 2011. The couple did not have children.

According to his obituary, LaFerrara was employed as the senior resident engineer at the Lycoming County Landfill.

The couple's arrests comes after Richard Beasley was given the death penalty in April this year after luring three men to an Ohio farm by using Craigslist job posts before killing them in cold blood.

Mr Barbour has been charged with criminal homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault and criminal conspiracy and possession of instruments of crime.

The 22-year-old man told police that he and his wife had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success. It was not until they came across LaFerrara on Craigslist that their plan finally came together.

Miranda Barbour offered little detail on the murders she claimed to have participated in in Alaska, Texas, North Carolina and California.

She claims she joined a satanic cult in Alaska when she was 13 before moving to North Carolina. Online records for the woman that the newspaper identified as Barbour's mother show her as having lived in both Alaska and North Carolina.

Last week, a judge granted a lawyer's request to have a forensic psychiatrist evaluate Miranda Barbour. The judge earlier approved a psychiatrist to evaluate Elytte Barbour.
