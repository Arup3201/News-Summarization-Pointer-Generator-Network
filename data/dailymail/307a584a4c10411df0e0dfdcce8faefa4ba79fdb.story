The elderly, former KKK leader charged with shooting dead three people at Jewish community centers was pen pals with fellow white supremacist bomber Kevin Harpham, it was revealed today.

Harpham is serving 32 years for the failed bombing of the MLK Day parade in Spokane, Washington in 2011.

Frazier Glenn Cross, aka Glenn Miller, 73, has been charged with three counts of murder following the Kansas City shooting spree on Sunday that left a 14-year-old boy, his 
grandfather and a 53-year-old woman dead.

had received fan mail from Frazier Glenn Cross (right)

Prosecutors investigating Cross said that the pair sent each other letters and postcards in 2011, according to ABC News.

In a letter, Cross told Harpham to 'stay strong' and offered to set up a legal defense fund as he appeared to believe that Harpham was innocent.

Harpham wrote back to Cross saying that he did not need money for a legal team but added that he may need him to house-sit.

The failed bomber also complained about his conditions in jail where there was a 'hard bed, limited clothing and blankets to keep 
warm'.

On January 17, 2011, two days before the annual celebration of one of America's greatest icons of peace and equality, Martin Luther King, a bomb was found in the small city of Spokane, Washington.

The radio-controlled pipe bomb was placed along the route of the MLK memorial march. 

It was filled with metal shrapnel and rat poison to prevent bleeding wounds from coagulating, thus intended to inflict maximum damage indiscriminately on the crowd.

Thankfully, the device, left in a backpack, was intercepted and defused by bomb disposal experts. It was sent to FBI HQ for further analysis and a $20,000 reward offered for the culprits. The timing and location of the bomb led investigators to believe that the attack was racially motivated.

On March 9, the FBI arrested white supremacist Kevin William Harpham, 36, of Addy, Washington.

He was sentenced that December to 32 years in prison for the attempted bombing.

Harpham was sentenced to 32 years  in 
2011 for the attempted bombing. Harpham, then 36, had planted a 
radio-controlled pipe bomb filled with a rat-poison chemical and 
shrapnel along the route of the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial march.

Cross appeared in court on Tuesday to be charged with capital murder for the deaths of Dr William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood,
 14.

Cross also faces one count of 
first-degree, premeditated murder for the death of Terri LaManno  who was 
gunned down while visiting her mother at a nearby retirement complex.

None of Sunday's victims were Jewish: 
Dr Corporon and his grandson were at the community center for a singing 
contest audition, while Ms LaManno was visiting her mother at the 
retirement 
complex.

Separate hate crime charges are expected to be filed later. He is being held on $10million bond. 

Cross, a former Vietnam veteran, founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux 
Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party.

After a 1986 contempt-of-court conviction
 in North Carolina for operating a paramilitary camp, Cross went in 
hiding while free on bond and fled to Missouri. 

There, federal agents found him and 
several other men in a rural mobile home stocked with hand grenades, 
automatic weapons and thousands of bullets.

Hateful: Cross, pictured, appeared to target Jews but none of his victims in fact belonged to the faith

Cross, 73, was arrested on Sunday following the two attacks in Kansas City that left three dead

Cross entered federal witness protection programs in 1987, according to The Wall Street Journal, and agreed to cooperate with authorities.

It is not clear when the protection ended.

Indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of SPLC founder Morris Dees, Cross served three years in federal prison but avoided a longer sentence in exchange for testifying against more than a dozen other KKK leaders.

'We were aware he was affiliated with certain hate groups,' FBI special agent Michael Kaste said at a Monday press conference.

Federal prosecutors say there's enough evidence to warrant putting the case before a grand jury as a hate crime. 

Moving the case from state to federal prosecutors would likely mean tougher punishments if Cross is convicted.

'The motivation behind these attacks 
was a hate crime... He was trying to hurt someone based on race or 
ethnicity,’ FBI agent Kaste said at a Monday press conference.

Before
 the shootings, Cross had been contemptuous of some of his like-minded 
allies' reliance on social media over violent confrontation.

'He
 felt it was easy to be a 'keyboard commando,' but that the only way 
activists will ever succeed is by going out on the streets,' said Devin 
Burghart, the vice president of the Institute for Research & 
Education on Human Rights.

Burghart said his group made a 
presentation on white supremacists to the Jewish Community Center in 
August, a discussion that included a description of Cross as an example 
of dangerous anti-Semitic figures in the region.

It wasn't clear what, if any, steps were taken by the center to act on the information.

The timing of the attack is worth 
noting, as a group monitoring anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. 
cautiously reported a sharp decline in such incidents less than two 
weeks before this weekend’s attack.

In
 a report April 1, the Anti-Defamation League noted a 19 per cent drop 
in anti-Semitic incidents last year compared to 2012, part of what the 
group called a 'decade-long downward slide' and one of its lowest 
tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979.

Racist: In recent years, watchdog groups were aware of Cross, seen here in an undated photo, and viewed him as a possible threat but because he had stopped posting as often, they became less concerned
