A new international study has revealed that intelligent girls 'choke' because of the pressure they put themselves under in employment leading to them ending up in lower paid jobs.

The Organisation for the Economic Co-operation Development (OECD) report on gender equality in education has said that girls do not aim for high-paying jobs in maths and science, because they lack confidence. 

Young girls 'may be choking under pressure' the report said.

Reviewing the report The Australian reported that high-achieving girls are more likely to suffer from high levels of anxiety than high-achieving boys.

'Given girls' keen desire to succeed in school and to please others, their fear of negative evaluations, and their lower self confidence in mathematics and science, it is hardly surprising high-achieving girls choke under often self-imposed pressure,' the OECD report said.

The OECD report said that just three per cent of Australian teenage girls contemplate a career in engineer or computing, compared to 17 per cent of boys.

The report is based on the OECD Program for International Student Assessment, which tests 400,000 students from more than 65 education systems worldwide.

'Women are predominantly employed in fields where they have fewer opportunities to express their potential, and develop and maintain their skills - at the price of lower wages and slower career paths,' the report said.

The report said that girls tend to hold particularly ambitious, but unrealistic, expectations.

'They may thus be particularly disappointed when they fail to achieve their career goals,' the report said.
