Manchester United's lingering hopes of signing Arturo Vidal have been crushed after his manager insisted the Chile forward will remain in Italy.

New Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri revealed he has held talks with the 27-year-old and that he has committed his future to the Serie A club.

United had been pursuing Vidal all summer but will now turn their attentions elsewhere, with Roma's Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman on their radar.

Allegri said: 'Vidal will stay here and he's very happy about this. I spoke with him about his fitness, we're happy he will stay with us.'

On Monday, Vidal posted a picture on Twitter of himself with team-mates Andrea Pirlo, Martin Caeceres and Marco Storari to reveal his side are 'ready' for the new season.

Vidal helped Chile reach the last 16 of the World Cup where they lost to hosts and eventual semi-finalists Brazil.

Allegri will get his first look at his players on Wednesday when they take on Cesena in a friendly.
