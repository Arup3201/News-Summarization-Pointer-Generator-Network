If you cheat you’re likely to have attended a handful of colleges - at least according to the world's largest adultery website.

An Ashley Madison survey out this week has revealed that people who have attended certain colleges are far more likely to cheat than those who haven’t.

And the University of Minnesota comes out top with Arizona State and SUNY Buffalo close behind.

‘It’s apparent from our survey that certain campuses offer a climate that's more conducive to would-be adulterers, typically someone more adventurous and looking to have new experiences,’ founder & CEO Noel Biderman said.

Top dog: The University of Minnesota has the most cheaters on Ashley Madison

The top ten cheaters’s schools were revealed when the adultery site polled well over 10,000 members to discover their Alma-maters and majors.

Coming in at number one was the University of Minnesota, with the highest number of members on the hookup site. 

The second place school is Arizona State University. SUNY Buffalo rounds out the top three.

In at number two: Arizona State University has the second-most members on the site

Ashley Madison members were also far more likely to have a college degree than to have just attended high school.

The most common major for cheaters? Psychology.

Almost a quarter of all cheaters have a postgraduate degree and almost the same amount maintained a GPA of 3.0 or above?

Over 80 per cent of cheaters attended public schools, and more than half lived on campus.

Less than 10 per cent of those on the site completed only high school.
