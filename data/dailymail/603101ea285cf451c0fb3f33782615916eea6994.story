Bryce Dion, 38, a sound engineer from California, was killed in Omaha after a shooting broke out while he was filming reality TV show Cops

Police accidentally shot dead a crew member of TV show Cops on Tuesday when they opened fire on a suspect armed only with a pellet gun, who was also killed. 

Sound engineer Bryce Dion, 38, who had worked on the reality show for seven years, was killed during the stand-off at a Wendy's restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska. 

A relative of the suspect Cortez Washington, 32, claimed on Wednesday that police officers over-reacted and were showing off for the cameras.

The unnamed relative told TMZ that the officers were 'hyped up' for the filming, adding: 'With everything going on in Ferguson, you think they would use other options.'

Police and the show's creators strenuously denied any suggestion that they were grandstanding for the cameras.

Cops creator John Langley said at a news conference: 'Cops truly is a reality show. It's not manipulated, it's not managed, it's not staged. It's all true, it's real, and it happens as it happens.'

Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said witnesses and officers thought the robbery suspect's Airsoft handgun looked and sounded real - but discovered later that it fired only plastic pellets.

Washington was struck by the officers' gunfire, but fled outside of the restaurant before collapsing. 

Officers continued firing on the suspect as he exited the restaurant - and Mr Dion was caught by stray bullets.

Dion was wearing a bulletproof vest, but a single bullet that struck his arm 'slipped into a gap in the vest' and went into his chest.

On a 911 call after the shooting, a voice can be heard saying: 'One of the Cops guys has been hit by gunfire. We need a squad here now... We need multiple squads, two squads.

The voice, believed to be a police officer, continued: 'We've got a Cops cameraman hit, white male, he's not conscious, he's breathing slightly.' 

Captain Schmaderer said: 'My concern with my officers is that they are taking this very hard. Bryce was their friend.'

Schmaderer said video captured by the cameraman who was with Mr Dion, the sound engineer, showed a chaotic situation in the restaurant. 

Police released still shots from the video showing a hooded and masked person pointing what appears to be a gun at officers.

Schmaderer said police would not release the full video but that it will be part of a grand jury investigation into the shooting.

Schmaderer said Washington had a lengthy criminal record, including an accessory to robbery conviction from Missouri for which he was on parole. He moved to Nebraska in September 2013, and his parole was due to expire in June 2017.

Schmaderer said the incident began at around 9.30pm on Tuesday when one of the officers, on his way to another reported robbery, called to request backup for the robbery at the Wendy's at 43rd and Dodge streets.

The Cops crew members were accompanying two officers who responded to that call.

When police entered the restaurant and confronted the suspect, Mr Dion became separated from the cameraman, Schmaderer said.

Following the shooting, Mr Dion and Washington were taken to the University of Nebraska Medical Center where they were both pronounced dead.

Cops is a reality TV show that depicts law enforcement officers in action. According to its website, the show has been filmed in at least 140 U.S. cities and three foreign countries.

Executives with Langley Productions said this was the first time one of their crew members has been fatally shot while filming. The show started on Fox in 1989 and is now shown on the Spike network.

In 2010, a TV crew for the A&E reality show 'The First 48' recorded a Detroit police raid in which a 7-year-old girl was accidentally killed by an officer. 

That incident highlighted concerns about whether TV cameras influence police behavior, perhaps encouraging showboating.

Upset: Schmaderer dismissed a reporter's suggestion that perhaps his officers were too aggressive in their response to the situation because they knew they were being filmed 

Schmaderer on Wednesday bristled at a reporter's question about whether his officers overreacted knowing that cameras were recording them, calling the suggestion 'absolutely ridiculous.' He said the video of Tuesday's shooting shows the officers reacted properly.

Schmaderer said he accepted the invitation from 'Cops' to film in Omaha in the name of transparency. But he also expressed regret at the outcome.

'Personally, I will live with this forever,' Schmaderer said. 'If I'd have known that this would happen, of course, I wouldn't have done it.'

Top executives for Langley Productions, President John Langely and Executive Producer Morgan Langley, attended the police news conference in Omaha and agreed that police there had acted professionally.

John Langley said the crew had been filming all summer in Omaha and had only one week left when the deadly shooting happened.

'Bryce has been with us for seven years,' said Morgan Langley, who hired Dion. 'This is very hard for us.

'He’s a very talented guy, he did something that he loved and was passionate about.'

The 38-year-old's neighbors in California told KCAL9 News that they didn't really know Mr Dion because he was always traveling for work.

Mr Dion, a native of Boston, has worked on over 80 episodes of 'Cops.' Only recently the sound technician had been promoted.

His IMDB page states that Dion also worked on the shows Jail, Vice Squad, Conquering Kilimanjaro With Angie Everhart and Undercover Stings.
