For most cost-conscious consumers, keeping a car running for as long as possible is a serious financial issue.

Automotive web site iSeeCars.com - which aggregates used car listings - have put together a study on cars with the best longevity, based on the amount that had been listed online with 200,000 or more miles on the odometer.

Topping the list was the Ford F-250 Super Duty with 4.2 percent, CBS News reported.

That represents about 4,000 pickups out of some 95,000 of that model for sale, according to Phong Ly, co-founder and CEO of iSeeCars.

To measure longevity, automotive web site iSeeCars.com - which aggregates used car listings - analyzed data to see what specific vehicles for sale had the highest percentage of listings with 200,000 or more miles on the odometer

Results: The list of cars is based on the amount that are listed as for sale with over 200,000 miles

Topping the list was the Ford F-250 Super Duty with 4.2 percent. That represents about 4,000 pickups out of some 95,000 of that model for sale

Interestingly, the top 10 rankings are all large pickups and SUVs, with the Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD taking second place.

'Clearly some of these vehicles are used for work and they are driven more miles but also perhaps get better maintenance,' Ly told CBS MoneyWatch.

Pickups are driven longer, with the average listing for all models showing 90,000 miles compared to 75,000 for the average car listing.

Among cars, Honda Accord was at the top, with 1.6 percent of listings showing over 200,000 miles.

But that percentage is relatively low, partly because there are so many Accords on the market.

Of the 377,000 Accords for sale, about 6,000 have over 200,000 miles.

Others among the top ten (when trucks and SUVS were excluded) included, in order - Subaru Legacy, Toyota Avalon, Honda Odyssey minivan, Nissan Maxima, Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, Honda Civic, Acura TL and Subaru Outback.

The Honda Accord was the number one car, the study found

While the top vehicles were SUVs and trucks, the Subaru Legacy also rated highly as a car

While Ford and Chevrolet topped the list of long-running trucks, the Ford Taurus is the only model on the car list from a Detroit-based brand.Â 

Increases in manufacturing quality in the last decade have contributed to more vehicles lasting for 200,000 miles or more.

'Car makers are making better vehicles, and that is a factor in the increasing longevity,' said Phong Ly.

That has resulted in a market even for well-used vehicles.

For instance, a 2003 Ford F-150 with 228,000 miles has an asking price of $4,900.

Family size: The Honda Odyssey has a good performance record

A 2001 Honda Accord sporting 250,000 miles is on sale for $3,000.

Those prices are 10 to 15 percent of list price for a well-equipped new 2014 version of the same model.

Experts say the easiest way to ensure your car runs as long as possible is to follow the prescribed maintenance schedule and use a good mechanic.

Ensuring that you got some highway driving in is also healthy for the car, with short stop-and-go trips hard on a car.
