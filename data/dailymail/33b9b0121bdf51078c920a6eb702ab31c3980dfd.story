An eye-catching advertising board to encourage new members to sign up to a gym has certainly got people talking but will it actually drum up business?

The bold slogan jumps out at passers-by with the very forward question: 'Are you tired of being fat and ugly? Just be ugly!' then with the gym's contact number.

The marketing ploy has created a mixed reaction among social media users with some finding the advertisement hilarious while others are quite offended by the sign believed to be at a college in America.

Would you sign up to this gym or do you find this advertisement insulting?

Media personality Mia Freedman posted the sign on Instagram with the comment: ' interesting way to get business.'

The photo produced a mixed response from fellow Instagramers with one person saying the fact that the sign had been posted and had created debate on social media meant the idea was already working.

'see u guys already winning.' marylisciouse said.

Some Instagramers found the marketing campaign quite entertaining with many posting 'ha!'.

While others didn't see the funny side at all.  

risingstrength saw it as an unfortunate sign of the times that we live in.

'Gosh this world we live in gets scarier by the minute glad I don't have kids!!!'

The slogan created a mixture of positive and negative responses from fellow Instagramers

iiNella Michaelis was so offended by the adverstising slogan that she posted a two-minute rant on You Tube.

She describes it as 'kinda funny but kinda messed up at the same time' but admits after reading it the second time that it was not 'cool'.

'Do not take advantage of the fact that they feel fat ok? If they wanna be fat - they can be fat. If they wanna by ugly - they can be ugly. If they wanna be a stripper - they can be a stripper ok? Don't judge.'

'If somebody has a triple stomach don't judge. If somebody has really bad hair and it's falling out - don't judge its their life. It's not your business ok?' she added.

She then suggests to take a more gentle approach to encourage people to exercise at the gym.  

'You could just be like you "do you wanna be a little bit slimmer and feel a little bit better?".'

She then ended her rant with saying that the advertisement preyed on the vulnerable. 

'Seriously don't take advantage of people's weaknesses like that - it's messed up - take that banner down because it makes me sick.'
