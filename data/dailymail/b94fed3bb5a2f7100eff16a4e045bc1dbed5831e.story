It's advice that comes straight from the highest office in the land - gents, forget Valentine's Day at your peril.

Barack Obama told a news conference in Washington this morning: 'Let me start with a quick public service announcement for all the gentlemen out there - today is Valentine's Day. Do not forget, I speak from experience here.

'It is important that you remember this and go big - that's my advice.'

Presidential mandate: Barack Obama advised all men not to forget Valentine's Day as he made an address at the White House this morning

Later in the day, a tweet appeared on the President's official Twitter which read: 'Hey, @MichelleObama: Happy Valentine's Day. -bo'.

Although both Barack and Michelle Obama have acknowledged in the past that their Twitter accounts are run by White House staffers, when the tweets are signed 'bo' and 'mo' respectively then it is reportedly from the couple themselves.

However it wasn't all chocolates and flowers at the White House today as the President got down to the serious business of talks with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, and future leader, about the relationship between the two countries.

There still might be time for a little romance as Michelle Obama told Access Hollywood last week: 'I think there might be a date night. There's something scheduled.

Keeping the romance alive: Michelle Obama revealed that the President serenades her with the hits of Al Green and Stevie Wonder as he warned men today 'not to forget Valentine's'

'It's hard for him to pull off the big surprise when you have a motorcade and police escorts.'

Earlier this month the First Lady revealed that her husband 'sings to her all the time' and favours the hits of Al Green, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder.

'He does have a beautiful voice,' Michelle Obama told The Tonight Show host Jay Leno.

The president gained a lot of attention last month for breaking out a bar of an Al Green song during a fundraiser at the Apollo Theater in New York City.

Love note: Barack Obama personally posted this message to his wife Michelle on his Twitter account

In past years, the Obamas have spent Valentine's Day in Chicago or Camp David.

The First Lady spoke last year 
about how she and President maintained the romance in their marriage 
with 'a lot of laughing' - and a 'little attitude'.

She also said that Barack 'couldn't go wrong with jewellery' for Valentine's Day.Â 

And it seems to be paying off - the couple have now been married for almost 20 years.

Look of love: The President and wife Michelle always make time for romance with scheduled 'date nights'
