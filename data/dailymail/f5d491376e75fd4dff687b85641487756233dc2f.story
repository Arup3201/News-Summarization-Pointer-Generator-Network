Eleven-year-old Farida was just playing in her backyard in Afghanistan when a bomb went off tearing through her eye and killing three of her siblings.

The young girl was given a second chance after her family defied the Taliban and collaborated with U.S. relief forces to give Farida the surgery she needed.

Through Solace for Children, a charity which helps injured children get medical attention, Farida was flown to North Carolina where she was treated for her missing eye and found a second home with a loving American family.

Farida, an 11-year-old girl from Afghanistan who who's eye was taken out by a Taliban bomb, has been given a second family and medical treatment through at North Carolina charity

Though the trip to North Carolina has greatly improved the quality of Farida life, to get her she has also managed to put it in peril.

After the explosion four years ago Farida's father, Abdul Rauf, 47, decided to send his daughter abroad for medical treatment despite the order of the Taliban controlled area, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The Taliban employees violent biblical methods such as stoning, cutting off hands, and gouging out eyes to those who defy their order to avoid contact with insurgent forces, who they identify as Kabul government officials and U.S. military or civilian aid, the newspaper reported.

Despite the physical danger Rauf, who was unable to provide adequate medical care for his wounded daughter being a poor farmer, decided to seek American aid.

The Solace for Children charity pairs injured Afghan children with American host families for six weeks during the summer, 'to experience America [and] to experience peace on a foundation of health,' Jim Gray, a board member on the charity told WCNC.

'Some people were saying if the Taliban finds out, they'll cut off your head,' Rauf told the newspaper.

'I asked these people: Are you afraid to have your own children treated? Will you sacrifice your own flesh and blood?'

'I told them: Something good is happening here. Don't be afraid.'

By taking these courageous steps Rauf has
provided opportunities for his daughter she would never have been 
exposed to otherwise.

After three summer getting medical treatment and living with a host family, Farida has completely adjusted to life in the U.S. seen her clutching her iPhone

Originally from a remote village in southern Afghanistan, Farida has adapted quickly to the United States since she arrived three summers ago, and now speaks fluent English complete with American slang, according to the Los Angeles Times.

In North Carolina he wounds were treated so that her left eye socket has now been fitted with a conformer shell, according to the paper, a clear plastic lens which reduces the friction in her eye socket when she blinks.

However, her socket closed over the plastic lens and she now needs further treatment.

She was also given a pair of glasses to 
correct the altered vision in her right eye and a sparkly purple eye 
patch to cover her left.

She has also been given a second family here in the United States.

Her host parents Asheli and Eric Thompson view Farida as their own daughter and in turn she calls them 'Mommy' and 'Daddy,' the article states.

The Thompson's, who have two young daughters of their own, gave Frida the full American experience while she stayed with them, taking her on a trip of Disney World, the ocean, and of course, sampling the local cuisine at McDonald's. 

Farida is the second injured girl the Thompson's took into their home, both of whom they view as their own.

Three
years ago the family hosted a 7-year-old girl who was also injured in a
Taliban attack, losing an eye and having part of her fact destroyed by 
acid.

After the explosion Farida had a conformer shell fitted to her eye and now wears a purple patch and corrective lenses

'It’s humbling, yet just a great feeling to know you've had a positive impact on somebody's life that's been through such trauma,' Eric Thompson told WCNC.

Now back at home Farida's progressive father is making sure the opportunities she was exposed to abroad don't go wasted.

Rauf has enrolled his daughter in school run by the charity in Kabul and does not intend to marry her off at a young age, but rather let her pursue an education, the paper reports.

'Everything is different now for her. She will go to school. She'll be an educated woman,' he told the Los Angeles Times. 'I believe in my heart it's things like this that will bring peace to our country.'

In 2012 Malala Yousafzai was also attacked by the Taliban in Pakistan after she published a blog post advocating for women's education

Since her near fatal attack Yousafzai has become a leading advocate for women's education in countries where it is prohibited

Farida's story follows a few years after the story of another young girl who was injured by the Taliban.

In 2012 Malala Yousafzai was attacked by Taliban forces after publishing an outspoken blog post advocating for women's education under the oppressive Taliban rule in Pakistan.

She was shot in the head and neck as she was being driven home from 
school in the Swat Valley in north-west Pakistan.

Malala was rushed to Britain where she received reconstructive surgery and eventually regained her eyesight.

Since the shooting Malala has become an outspoken human activist for women's rights in countries with oppressive regimes.
