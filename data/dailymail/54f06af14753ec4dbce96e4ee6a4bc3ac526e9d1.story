As many women today are hit with long periods of low libido, the quest to get us going in the bedroom is in full swing.

Talk of a potential chemical 'female Viagra' was met with mixed reviews, but now a new elixir remedy promises to boost your libido the all-natural way.

BioBee Fresh Royal Jelly elixir claims to not only increase libido but stamina too.

Damiana Aphrodisiaca extract and Fresh Royal Jelly 'can increase sexual desire'

Harrods bestseller BioBee Fresh Royal Jelly elixir claims to not only increase libido but stamina too

Already a bestseller at Harrods and now launched at Selfridges, the elixir made of royal jelly, Korean ginseng, guarana powder, damiana aphrodisiaca extract, ginger, liquorice
 and sarsaparilla extract is described as 'a 
powerhouse of vitamins, minerals and amino acids.'

'Ginseng and guarana are very good 
for raising energy levels,' says leading fertility expert 
Marisa Peer.

'In order to have a great sex life, it is 
important to stay up and be energetic. The elixirs 
will give you the energy to keep going while the aphrodisiac extract 
will give you the motivation to start.'

BioBee's Fresh Royal Jelly elixirs contain all natural ingredients in a unique blend of fresh herbs. Whilst there have been no trials specifically on this product, there have been many studies on the effects of damiana in boosting libido.*

The damiana aphrodisiaca ingredient present in BioBee’s Elixirs is traditionally used as an aphrodisiac by Mexicans.

Damiana is a wild shrub that grows in
 Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. The leaf and stem of the 
Damiana leaves have been used as to boost sexual 
potency by the native peoples of Mexico, including the Mayan Indians, for many years.

Historically, it was used primarily as an energy tonic and an aphrodisiac for both 
male and female sexual stimulation.

'Damiana
 (Tunera Aphrodisiaca) is found throughout Mexico, Central America and 
the Caribbean. Its Latin name (Tunera aphrodisiaca) suggests its use as 
an aphrodisiac.

'In
 the years following the European conquest of Central and South American
 Damiana has been associated with improvement of sexual function in both
 males and females.

'In
 Holland it is renowned for its sexual enhancing qualities and positive 
effects on reproductive organs. In particular, Damiana has been shown to
 increase the sensitivity of genital tissues.

'With
 aging, sensitivity of these tissues is often reduced due to fewer 
functioning nerve endings. Damiana helps to compensate for this effect, 
re-establishing heightened sensitivity and arousal capabilities.'

Extract from Natural Support for Sexual Performance & Libido Enhancement in Men and Women research report

The MailOnline recently reported how 30
 and 50  per cent of British, European and American women have been hit by prolonged periods of little or no sex
 drive, and a third of Brits say sex is a 'chore', as they are too tired, stressed and don't feel attractive.

Meanwhile Relate, a British 
charity supporting the nation's relationships, have said that a lack of sexual desire is one of the most common reasons people use their sex therapy service.

Up to 40 per cent of infertility is caused by males since they can suffer from not having enough sperm or having sperm that can't swim straight.

'Bee pollen is very good for fertility then, because it increases the quality, quantity and motility of sperm. It can also help with egg quality because it's so nourishing,' said Peer.

The fresh royal jelly in the product is the creamy substance worker bees produce, the majority of which is fed directly to their queen bee.

Due
 to her supremely nutritious diet she can lay up to 2,000 eggs a day and
 also live 40 times longer than the worker bees.

Royal
 Jelly is most well known for being a longevity promoting agent, 
although this claim is not fully supported. It does appear to interact 
with hormones in the body, both testosterone (where aside from 
containing a negligible amount, it can enhance testicular production of 
testosterone) and estrogen (where it increases estrogen in 
post-menopausal animals, and might selectively reduce the effects of 
estrogen in youth). However, these effects on hormones are quite 
unreliable and hard to predict although they occur at reasonable 
dosages.

'Ginseng and guarana raise energy levels. In order to have a great sex life, it is important to stay up'

In a study on fresh royal jelly, all tested doses were able to increase 
sexual desire significantly in infertile men.

The BioBee's
 version uses only premium ingredients and they claim theirs is superior to other royal jelly products on the market as their product uses a fresh royal jelly, not a freeze-dried version.

Scientific research has
 shown that freeze-drying can degrade royal jelly quicker and may also 
destroy some of the valuable enzymes and nutrients.

BioBee's elixirs cost £25.34 for a box of 10 vials and are available at Harrods and Selfridges stores and at bioceuticals.co.uk
