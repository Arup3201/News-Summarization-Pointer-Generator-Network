The model charged with the murder of British millionaire Andrew Bush at his villa in Spain has claimed that she didn't know he was dead when she fled home to Slovakia.

Mayka Kukucova, who is accused of killing Mr Bush last weekend, was arrested 2,000 miles from the crime scene and appeared before a judge in a court in Trencin on Thursday.

She said that media reports on Mr Bush's death were wrong.

According to Netky.sk, she told Slovakian media: 'I let myself into the hands of police 
thinking that my country will provide me protection and without 
sufficient evidence will not extradite me to Spain, because everything happened differently than media has described it.'

Kukucova's lawyer said that she did not know Mr Bush was dead and only 
learned about his death once she had left Spain, which she fled because 
she feared for her 'life and health'.

Kukucova has claimed she shot Mr Bush dead in self-defence following a furious argument about maintenance for their unborn baby.

The
 claim emerged as Mr Bush's family visited his villa to leave flowers 
and messages, with one, from his daughter Ellie, saying 'we will always 
love you'.

Kukucova, 24, was escorted by police 
officers to the region Court in Trencin after being arrested on Tuesday afternoon.

Mr Bush, 48, was shot in the head at his 
villa in Estepona, on the Costa del Sol, last Saturday while visiting 
with his most recent lover, Maria Korotaeva.

On Thursday it was reported that, while Kukucova was missing, she sent her parents a
 text message saying she had shot Mr Bush in self-defence and Slovakian media said she would plead self-defence in court.

Spanish
 newspapers picked up on the claims and said she sent her family a text 
message insisting she had not planned to kill Mr Bush.

What's more, a source close to the investigation said that in the message she claimed to have been pregnant with Mr Bush's child, according to the Daily Mirror.

The source said: 'Mayka told them she went to Spain to discuss financial arrangements for the child with Mr Bush because he was refusing to speak to her.'

The source added: 'She says that she confronted him about it, but he then attacked her and she was forced to defend herself. She claims to have the bruises to prove it.'

Members of Mr Bush's family were visibly upset as they left flowers and messages at the villa on Thursday.

His ex wife Samantha Mason, 45, and her sister Rachel, along with daughter Ellie Mason, comforted each other outside the building during the visit, during which they also collected some of his personal belongings.

The jewellery dealer was shot twice in 
the head as he arrived at his five-bed holiday home in Cancelada near 
the resort of Estepona with new Russian lover Maria Korotaeva.

Spanish newspapers have reported that the 
24-year-old sent a message to her parents while she was on the run this 
week claiming she shot Mr Bush in self-defence

University
 student Miss Korotaeva, 21, currently being comforted by family and friends
 in Tenerife where she spent part of her childhood, has told Spanish 
police Miss Kukucova confronted them as they arrived at Mr Bush's villa 
in the early hours of Saturday morning.

She
 said she stayed outside as the pair rowed inside - and saw his 'madly 
jealous' ex flee the property in the Brit's 4x4 after hearing the sound 
of gunshots.

Mr Bush was found lying in a pool of blood inside.

His radio presenter ex-wife Sam Bush flew to the Costa del Sol with their daughter Ellie to bring him back to the UK.

ex-girlfriend Kukucova waiting

Kukucova has been accused of being a 'madly jealous' ex who killed Mr Bush to stop anyone else having him

She took to Facebook on Wednesday night to thank Spanish police for their work.

She
 said: 'Must thank the brilliant, yet not respected enough Spanish 
police, especially the team that dedicated 24 hours a day towards 
searching and apprehending the prime suspect of my husband's brutal 
murder.

'Our daughter, my sister and mother-in-law are finally able to grieve. We will never get over this as we are his family.

Ms Kukucova was arrested after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia. The town is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Estepona, Spain

Korotaeva described Kukucova (pictured) as a 'snake' and branded her an 'uneducated psycho'

'I'm hoping to see Andy tomorrow [Thursday] and to ascertain whether it's appropriate for my girls to see him also.

'Evidently he took three gun wounds. We will see the judge in the morning who will advise us when we can bring him home.

'We felt a small bitter sweet justice when, as the family, we were first told of the arrest. We are all emotionally broken and our lives won't simply move on.'

Spanish
 police have not revealed why they believe Mr Bush was killed, although 
his current girlfriend has said Miss 
Kukucova was 'madly jealous' and it was 'her or no one.'

Miss Korotaeva says Kukucova argued with Mr Bush before she heard shots  (pictured, Mr Bush and Miss Korotaeva on a Valentine's break in Paris)

Miss Korotaeva has accused Miss Kukucova of Mr Bush's murder, saying 'She done it. God will be her judge'

Accusing the Slovakian, Miss Korotaeva claimed her boyfriend had had to 
change all the locks at his house, saying: 'Andy hated her with a 
passion. She was like a poisonous snake.'

The
 judge in Slovakia will decide whether to remand her in custody or release her on 
bail while continuing an investigation into Mr Bush's killing.

Spanish authorities are hoping she will be extradited within the next seven days.

She has taken to twitter and Instagram today to praise Mr Bush, calling him her 'teacher' who 'changed my world for better [sic.]'

According to Miss Korotaeva, Mr Bush couldn't stand to hear Kukucova's name and his family resented her
