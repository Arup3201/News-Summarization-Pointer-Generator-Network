Another winter storm is set to strike the Northeast, pummeling the already-frozen landscape with as much as ten inches of snow in a four-day onslaught.

Less than a week after parts of the region received unprecedented levels of snowfall, a new system is set to roll down across the Midwest from the Canadian border.

The storm, dubbed Marcus, is due to start with light snow Saturday, but will intensify and continue through to Tuesday.

Coming in: Forecasters say almost another foot of snow could blanket the Northeast during a four-day storm

Starting out: An initial storm over the weekend, the track of which will move from west to east as seen above, will be reinforced by a second at the start of next week

Freezer: The above map from the National Weather Service shows the likelihood of temperatures being below average over the week week. Deeper blue means a higher chance of a large difference. The West Coast will be warmer than usual in the same period

Winter weather will carve a path stretching from New York City in the south into the upper reaches of Vermont and New Hampshire to the north, according to forecasts by Accuweather.

Massachusetts, and Boston in particular, will be at the epicenter of the snowstorm, and could be due another 11 inches of snow.

The region is still digging its way out from under a 40-inch dump that has come in the past two weeks, setting new snowfall records in the state's capital.

Most of Massachusetts was already on a winter storm alert Friday night. The snowfall is set to be accompanied by bitter cold, with the National Weather Service predicting temperatures far below average for stretching from Philadelphia to southern Maine.

Stacking up: The above chart shows how intensely major parts of New England and the Northeast are set to be struck, with already-snowy Boston due the most

Lingering: Snow is still causing problems in the area set to be struck again. Above, cars and a trailer pile up on a road in Sandy Creek, upstate New York

Just chilling: Meanwhile in Chicago, which is further west than the storm, ice carvers set to work in one of the city's parks

The initial storm, which is due to drop several inches of snow over the weekend, will be followed immediately by a new cold weather system which will bring yet more snow.

However, the outer reaches of the 'snow corridor' straddling New England will be less badly affected, with as little as three inches of snow forecast over New York City.

According to The Weather Channel, the dip in temperatures will be due to disturbances in the jet stream pushing the boundaries of cold and warm air past the Canadian border into the U.S.

The outlet also said that, while there could be significant snowfall across the four days, the disruption will be less than in a short, intense storm because snow plows will have more time to clear it up.
