Lord Heseltine has warned David Cameron he would be taking a 'punt' by rushing into a referendum over Britain's membership of the EU.

The former minister, known for his Europhile views - fuelled tensions in the Conserative Party by questioning the possibility of a national vote happening before negotiations over the EU's future have started.

His comments came ahead of a hotly-anticipated speech by Mr Cameron on the union later this month.

Warning: Former Conservative minister Lord Heseltine has told David Cameron he would be taking a 'punt' by rushing into a holding a national vote over Britain's future membership of the EU

Lord Heseltine, an adviser to the coalition on economic growth, said in The Times: 'Mrs Thatcher said "Never go into a room unless you know how to get out of it".

'To commit to a referendum about a negotiation that hasn't begun, on a timescale you cannot predict, on an outcome that's unknown, where Britain's appeal as an inward investment market would be the centre of the debate seems to me like an unnecessary gamble.'

He added: 'If I was responsible for inward investment into any of our European colleagues, it would give me the best argument I could dream of.

'Why put your factory (in Britain) when you don't know - and they can't tell you - the terms upon which you will trade with us in future?'

Labour seized on Lord Heseltine's comments.

Shadow Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: 'Even Michael Heseltine, the Prime Minister's own adviser on growth, thinks David Cameron's approach to Europe is bad for business and bad for Britain.

'The chorus of criticism is growing by the day.

'At a time when the priority should be jobs and growth, the Prime Minister sadly seems willing to put vital UK investment at risk for the sake of trying to keep his party united.

'Starting the year by edging Britain towards exit simply undermines confidence and prospects for growth - British business and even the Prime Minister's own adviser recognise this - when will he?"

Lord Heseltine was speaking after Chancellor George Osbourne suggested Britain would quit the EU unless Brussels agreed to major reforms, including the repatriation of a string of powers to the UK.

Asked whether the UK would still be in the EU in ten years, Mr Osborne said: ‘I very much hope that Britain remains a member of the EU.

But in order that we can remain in the European Union, the EU must change.’

The Chancellor’s explicit warning that Britain will quit the EU unless other member states agree to a major renegotiation of the relationship came in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt.

It will pile pressure on David Cameron to follow suit when he makes his long-awaited speech on Europe later this month.

Mr Cameron has said that life outside the EU is ‘imaginable’ but has suggested he is reluctant to include the option of leaving in any referendum.

Coalition tensions on the issue were underlined last night when Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable suggested the growing debate about Britain’s membership of the EU was damaging business confidence in the economy.

Mr Cable said the issue was ‘a massive disruption and deeply unhelpful in my job’.

He claimed that quitting the EU would result in the UK descending into the politics of economic protectionism and nationalism which the single market rules currently prevent.

In a surprise intervention, the leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament hit out at those in his own party demanding a hard line against Brussels.

MEP Richard Ashworth said the strident Euroscepticism gave the impression of a Britain that was ‘snarling like a pitbull across the Channel’.

He said Britain was ‘making ourselves look pretty darned unattractive’ as a partner in the EU.

Discussing Mr Cameron’s ambition to claw back powers from Brussels, he said an ‘evolutionary solution’ was the way to proceed, rather than the ‘nuclear option’ of quitting the EU.

But Tory Eurosceptics  welcomed the Chancellor’s intervention.

Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said Mr Cameron would get the best deal for Britain only if he made it clear the UK was otherwise prepared to quit.

He urged the Prime Minister to hold an immediate referendum to give him a mandate to negotiate with Brussels, followed by a second referendum on the deal in which the British people would have the option to leave the EU.

Mr Cable, in a speech at King’s College, London, made it clear the Lib Dems would resist any attempt to have a major renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the EU.

The Chancellor’s comments came in an interview on Tuesday, but were only published yesterday. In the intervening period, both the US and Germany have warned Britain against holding a referendum on Europe.

On Wednesday, US assistant secretary for European affairs Philip Gordon said the Obama administration wanted ‘a strong British voice’ in the EU and warned that referendums risked turning countries ‘inward’.

The following day a key ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a sharp warning that any attempt at ‘blackmailing’ member states into accepting change would backfire on Britain.

Bundestag European affairs committee chairman Gunther Krichbaum said a referendum could leave the UK isolated  in Europe.

A Treasury aide insisted that Mr Osborne’s comments were fully consistent with the Government’s position – that the EU needs to change ‘and indeed is changing’.

Downing Street yesterday said that Mr Cameron had talked Barack Obama through Britain’s approach to Europe when they spoke before Christmas, and that the US president was supportive.

‘We want to change our  relationship with the EU and seek consent on that,’ the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.
