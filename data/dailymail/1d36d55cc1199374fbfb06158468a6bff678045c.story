Bamboozled: Californian Bobbie Beale was left scratching her head after she started being abused online by EastEnders fans

For some time she was left bewildered after receiving a number of accusing messages from fans of the soap.

The messages from the UK continued with a mystified Miss Beale asking: 'Who are you?' and explaining she was a not a boy. 

She then posted a selfie alongside the hashtag #IdidntKillLucy. 

She said: 'I starting getting tweets in the afternoon. It was pretty confusing because I thought they were talking about by dog Lucy. 

'I looked up the show and I thought, Oh, this makes sense now, but at first I was really confused because I thought it was a real-life thing and I thought Bobby Beale killed someone and I was like, "It's not me".' 

'I got 1,500 new followers and 15,000 retweets. I was in class and my phone died because of all the notifications.

'I have definitely not killed my sister and definitely not killed my dog'.
