Zohra Amrani, 59, and her husband Hassan are believed to have been killed by their son at their home in Westbourne Grove

This is the mother who was allegedly murdered alongside her husband by her convicted rapist son, just days after he was released from jail.

Zohra Amrani, 59, and her husband Hassan, 72, were found dead at their home in Westbourne Grove, west London, 24 hours after their son plunged to his death.

Ashraf Amrani, 30, fell to his death on Friday in a suspected suicide. He was found by residents on the first floor of a block of flats, on the same street where police later discovered his parents’ bodies.

The second discovery was made when officers went to inform the couple of their son’s death.

Detectives have launched an investigation following the suspected murder-suicide but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.

The case has now been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 

The young man had been released from jail after raping a 23-year-old woman and was also arrested on suspicion of affray days earlier.  

Amrani was sentenced to seven years and two months in June 2010 after filming the vicious sex attack then threatening to send the footage to his victim’s family.

The offender, who had a sexually transmitted disease, carried out the attack at his family’s flat in Notting Hill, where his parents were found dead on Saturday. 

Last night, neighbours said officers had been called to the property a day before the murders and Amrani had refused to let them in. He was arrested on suspicion of affray last Tuesday and was due to answer his bail on Wednesday. 

It also emerged that Amrani had committed a series of attacks on women. Police confirmed their handling of the case is being referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

In November 2009 he raped the 23-year-old after ordering her to carry out ‘humiliating’ domestic tasks.

Jurors at Southwark Crown Court were shown film of the naked victim crying as Amrani barked orders and threatened to slash her. Judge Gregory Stone described the crime as ‘a sustained attack of violence, humiliation and coerced sexual acts.’  

Neighbours said Amrani had recently been released from jail after serving half of his sentence and his retired Moroccan parents - described as a 'very sweet couple' - had been upset when he turned up at their flat.

A woman who lives next door said Mrs Amrani had told her on Thursday that ‘there was some trouble in the house’, adding that police had been called to the address on Thursday, but a man, believed to be the couple's son, had tried to block them from going inside.

She said: 'The last time I saw the wife was on Thursday and she didn't look happy. She looked a bit fed up and sad. 

'She said her husband had called her and said there was some trouble in the house.

'On that same night when I went home, my brother told me that police had been round and they were looking for the son and opened the door.

'He got the impression he was in there and not letting them in. I hadn't seen the son for a few years, and then I saw him again about a month and a half ago.' 

The woman added that she had heard nothing suspicious from the couple's home on Friday.

She said: 'There was no noise, nothing to indicate what might happen.' 

She paid tribute to the 'lovely couple' who also have a grown-up daughter and a grandson.

'They were just a really nice couple. I'm just so shocked. They were always so nice,' she said.

'She would always go and see her daughter and grandson.'

The neighbour said the couple, originally from Morocco, were very house-proud and doting grandparents to their grandson, who is around seven or eight years old.

She said: 'The husband was a very quiet man. They had an extremely beautiful house. She kept everything immaculate. They would often go back to Morocco and see their family. It is awful.'  

No arrests have been made and Scotland Yard detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident

Three bouquets of flowers were left as a tribute to the grandparents who were described as a 'lovely couple'

But the son was described as 'trouble for his family' by neighbours.

Neighbour Farhad Chowdhury, 28, said: 'The mother was very nice to us. She would always say hello and have a chat.

'It’s very sad because she treated me like a son. And she even went to my sister’s wedding.

'She was a lovely woman and every now and then she would come over and cook with my mum and share recipes.

'She was very nice to our whole family. When I first heard what happened I was shocked.

'The father we didn’t see so much because he would be coming and going from Morocco.

'I came home from work and saw all the police and they had taped off all the homes. It gave me a heart attack because I didn’t know what was happening.

'I would see the son every now and then and we would say hello to each other. He disappeared for a while and I didn’t see him for a few years. I think he had been trouble for the family. 

Three people believed to be from the same family have died in a suspected murder-suicide. A man and a woman were found dead in Landor House, west London

'He came back about six months ago and when I saw him again he had changed, he just looked different almost depressed.'  

Other neighbours on the estate shared their disbelief about what had happened.

Sotira Savva, 75, said: 'It's just devastating, and to have it happen in this estate. I have lived here for 40 years and it has changed but it’s always been quiet. This is just horrible for the whole estate.”

Floral tributes have been left by friends of the couple outside the home.

One woman, who wished not to be named, who was friends with Zohra Amrani through the local Muslim community said: 'I just wanted to come down and say some prayers for them.

'When I found out yesterday what happened I couldn’t believe it. I was so upset I couldn’t stop crying.

'She was a lovely woman, so so nice to everyone. It’s so sad.' 

A friend of Ashraf Amrani, who asked not to be named, said: 'I don't know much about it, but I know he was in prison before.

'I think he must have got out recently. I'm not going to talk about why he was locked up.' 

Last night, a police forensics tent had been erected in the back garden of the ground floor flat in Landor House, a two storey block near Royal Park.

Police cordoned off the nearby estate area and forensics teams scoured the crime scene. Flowers were laid outside the flat where the couple were found.

Scotland Yard detectives are treating the incident as a suspected murder suicide and they are not seeking anyone in connection with the three deaths.

The case is due to be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission on Monday, according to a Met spokesman.
