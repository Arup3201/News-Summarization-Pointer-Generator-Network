Two suspects with illustrious names have fallen foul of the law in Philadelphia, according to police. 

Ulysses Grant, 28, and Theodore Roosevelt Gaines, 49, who share their names with the 18th and  26th presidents of the United States respectively, were busted this month on separate drugs and theft charges. 

Grant was charged with possession with intent to deliver narcotics following his arrest on December 10.

The 28-year-old told ABC News he was not guilty but admitted that he was carrying a knife and stun gun. He was not charged for this alleged crime. 

The suspect, who said he was named because President Grant was his great-grandfather, was planning to fight the drug charges following a court appearance this week.

He claimed that Philadelphia cops brought him to a home which had 'crack inside and forced him to sign a paper', ABC reported. 

In a separate incident on Sunday, Theodore Roosevelt Gaines, 49, was caught stealing from a grocery store, according to Philadelphia Daily News reporter Dana DiFilippo.

The suspect, from Roslyn, Pennsylvania, allegedly left the store with goods worth close to $120.

Police refused to release a photograph of Gaines. 

The Philadelphia Police Department said in a statement to Daily Mail Online on Wednesday that they could not verify if the names are the males’ birth names, adding 'these are the names they provided at the time of their arrest(s)'.
