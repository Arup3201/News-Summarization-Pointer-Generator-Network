It appears Kris Humphries has struck a deal to auction off the engagement ring that he gave to Kim Kardashian during their ill-fated romance, MailOnline has learned.

The NBA star is said to be selling the Lorraine Schwartz ring that he gave to Kardashian at an upcoming Christie's auction in New York.

The ring is expected to sell for between $300,000 and $500,000- which is less than a quarter of the price that the ring was said to have cost originally.

Bling: Kim's former 20-carat sparkler was used by Humphries to propose to Kim back in May 2011

Return: Kim returned her former engagement ring to Kris following their divorce

Same cut: The seller of the ring is known only as 'a gentleman' but the description exactly matches the ring Humphries gave Kim Kardashian (pictured left and right) before their 72-day marriage

An 'impressive' ring made by Lorraine Schwartz, a designer and Kardashian family friend, is featured as part of the upcoming October 15 auction titled 'Bright and Beautiful'.

Humphries has not publicly stated that he is selling his ex's ring, and the owner of the item is only listed as the 'property of a gentleman', but the dimensions of the sparkler are the exact same as that of the ring that once belonged to Kardashian.

It is made up of a 16.21-carat rectangular cut diamond which is then flanked by a 1.80-carat diamond on either side.

All told, that adds up to just under 20-carats which is very close to the descriptions of Kardashian's ring, as it was said to be just over 20-carats. 

Showing off: Kim proudly displayed the ring that Humphries paid for. It ended up going to him in the divorce because he argued that their marriage was a sham and she did not deserve to keep the ring as a result

Sold: Earlier this month, Kim's bling was finally sold at auction for a cool $749,000

Pictures of the ring show that the ring listed at Christie's and the bauble that the reality star flaunted following their May 18, 2011 engagement and the entirety of their 72-day marriage are a perfect match.

Though the discrepancies in the carat size are slight, the gap between what Humphries was said to have paid for the ring and its current estimate is much wider.

When Humphries popped the question after a whirlwind six-month romance, the ring was said to cost $2million.

A family friend of the Kardashians said that Humphries reportedly 'got a great deal' by working with jeweller Lorraine Schwartz, who had designed for the Kardashian clan for years.

Happier times: The two have since moved past their 72-day marriage, and their annulment proceedings actually lasted longer than their wedded union

Because of the estimate of the Christie's jewellery experts, it appears that he paid far less for the ring than reported at the time.

The bad publicity following the Humphries-Kardashian divorce that lasted longer than their marriage may have had an effect on the sale.

Christie's press representative Gabriel Ford told MailOnline that their team of experts 'estimate on what they deem it worth at this time (of the auction)'.

The auction house also specified that a portion of the ring’s sale will be donated to charity by the owner, though the name of the charity has not been announced nor has the percentage of the sale price.

New man: Kardashian is now dating Kanye West, and the pair's daughter North was born on June 15
