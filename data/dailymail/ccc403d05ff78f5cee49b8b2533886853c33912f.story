Two rival TV helicopter pilots who fought publicly over who was the first to spot the infamous OJ Simpson car chase have now become firm friends - after both becoming women.

On June 17, 1994, Dirk Vahle and Bob Tur were the first pilots to spot OJ Simpson's white Bronco as the sports star lead police on a slow-speed chase while holding a gun to his head.

But 20 years later the reporters have found friendship after both having hormone replacement therapy, becoming Dana Vahle and Zoey Tur.

The pair hadn't spoken to each other since arguing over who spotted the OJ first, but got in touch again a year ago after mutual friend and fellow pilot Desiree Horton told Tur to contact Vahle.

According to KPCC, Tur said: 'Desiree told me I should get in touch with Dirk Vahle. I said, 'Why? Dirk Vahle is an a**hole. She said, 'Because Dirk is now Dana.'"

Meanwhile Vahle, who began his transformation two years before Tur, found out about Tur's change from a news report, saying: 'You've got to be f**king kidding me!'

The two now support each other, with Vahle giving advice to Tur on the reassignment process after Tur decided to make his treatment public.

Despite their news rivalry being long in the past, the pair still argue over what happened during the OJ chase.

Vahle recalled: 'Everybody at my station feels very strongly that we were actually there before Bob Tur which, of course, is something we all wanted to do in that market at that point.'

She claims that Tur's footage appeared on air sooner only because her station, NBC, delayed getting the feed through, while CBS put the footage up immediately.

Simpson was pursued by police after failing to turn himself in, charged with the double murder of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman.

He left a rambling note leading many to believe he was about to commit suicide, but instead forced his friend Al Cowlings to drive him along in his Bronco while holding a gun to his own head.

While Tur and Khale were the first on the scene, eventually 20 news helicopters joined the pursuit, which was watched on TV by an estimated 95million people.

Meanwhile thousands of spectators lined the route to wave at Simpson, with some carrying banners encouraging him to run.
