Two teenagers on a date have described their horror at watching a van driver hit a grandmother pushing her baby granddaughter in a carriage and then repeatedly back over her until she was dead.

The awful scene played out in a parking lot in Lynn, Massachusetts, on Sunday. Kathleen McPartland, 60, died at the scene but the baby, miraculously, was not injured. 

Eighteen-year-old Moises Baez and 17-year-old Amanda Arsenault said the driver claimed he didn't even realize he had hit the woman. The pair said he did not stop trying to drive over her until she was already dead.

Horror: A grandmother on a stroll with her young relative was killed by a man driving a van when he backed up over her and repeatedly went back and forth until she was dead

Unexpected witnesses: Eighteen-year-old Moises Baez and 17-year-old Amanda Arsenault were in a nearby car and saw the entire incident take place as they screamed for the driver's attention

'He was just burning out on her,' Baez told the Lynn Daily Item.

He described how the driver repeatedly backed over her and spun his back wheels on Ms McPartland's body while he tried to drive away from the parking spot. 

The teens said they screamed at the driver and begged him to stop, but he appeared oblivious to their cries.

Baez said the driver was blaring music and appeared not to understand English.

Small miracle: While the grandmother was declared dead at the scene, her grandchild in the carriage was unharmed

Too late: The teenage witnesses said that they screamed to try to get the driver's attention but his music was blaring and appeared not to understand English

Just met: Amanda Arsenault and her friend had asked the victim for directions minutes before her death

'I still don’t understand how he didn’t feel he hit somebody, because that dent’s pretty huge,' he said.

By the time the man stopped his van, Ms McPartland was motionless, the couple said.

The two teens told the Daily Item that they were on a date and planned to walk to a nearby park and stopped Ms McPartland to ask for directions.

'She was really nice, too,' Arsenault said. 

'She was a grandmother,' they said, 'but she was young. She still had some pep in her.'

The child miraculously escaped harm. Her carriage was past the van when it backed over Ms McPartland.

The driver's name was not released. Police are investigating the incident for potential charges.
