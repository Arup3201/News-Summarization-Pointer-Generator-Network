As England’s cricketers prepared for a pre-Ashes match on Saturday, Australian captain Michael Clarke appeared on the big screen and told the crowd: ‘Remember to drink within your boundaries.’

But perhaps his advice would have been better directed at the professionals in the changing rooms.

Just a few hours later, Australian batsman David Warner attacked England’s rising star Joe Root, 22, during a drunken scuffle in a Birmingham city centre bar after he took offence at the green and gold comedy wig he was wearing.

England beat Australia in the competition’s opening match at Edgbaston – a warm-up before next month’s Ashes.

Night out: Both players were believed to be in this Walkabout bar in Birmingham on Saturday night

After enjoying the weekend sunshine and posing in town with fans, young  England players Root, Steve Finn and Stuart Broad  headed out to Walkabout – an Australian-themed bar.

There they met Warner, who was out drinking with five of his Australian teammates.

At about 2am, a ‘slaughtered’ Warner confronted members of the squad and CCTV footage shows him throwing a punch at Root, striking him in the chin with a ‘glancing blow’.

Australian Clint McKay managed to drag Warner away, while England’s  Stuart Broad protectively put his arms around Root.

Warner was apparently mortified when he woke up the next morning, phoning Root to apologise for overreacting.

He later picked up the group’s bar tab to try to make amends for his outburst. Teacher Ashley Fox, 25, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, was at the bar on Saturday night.

He said: ‘We were having a laugh with Stuart Broad and Joe Root on the dancefloor.

‘They were in good spirits and Root even bought me a drink. They seemed to be having a good time.

Star: But opening batsman Warner could miss the Ashes after courting more controversy

‘I saw it kicking off and a punch was
 swung but it was just a bit of a glancing blow. The two teams had been 
goading each other all night.

'I never expected it to boil over like it did. You would expect two professional teams to behave.’

Staff said Warner had been drinking at Walkabout in the evenings ever since the team arrived in Birmingham last week.

A barman said: ‘On Thursday I was serving him Jagerbombs [shots of Jagermeister liqueur combined with Red Bull] and vodka Red Bulls.

‘He had quite a few. He was downing them on Saturday night as well. He was pretty slaughtered.’

Warner was dropped from the Australian
 team after a crisis meeting yesterday morning.

He now faces a 
disciplinary hearing for bringing the game into disrepute with 
‘behaviour unbecoming to a representative player’.

A spokesman for Cricket Australia 
said: ‘Warner was allegedly involved in a physical altercation with an England player in the early hours of Sunday morning.

‘Team management have stood down Warner pending the outcome of the hearing.’

West Midlands Police said officers were not called to deal with the alleged assault.

Face-off: The alleged fight came after England beat Australia in a Champions Trophy game at Edgbaston

BODYLINE - THE ROW WHICH SPARKED A DIPLOMATIC CRISISEngland captain Douglas Jardine devised arguably the most controversial of all cricket tactics to combat the great batsman Donald Bradman during the Ashes series of 1932. His bowlers - in particular Harold Larwood - repeatedly bowled fast, short deliveries which bruised the Australian batsmen. The tactic sparked an international outcry and a row which reached governmental levels.

BOTHAM/CHAPPELL - TWO FIERY FIGURES WHO COULD NEVER GET ALONGTensions ran high when England star Ian Botham and Australian firebrand Ian Chappell clashed in a Melbourne hotel in 1977. Supposedly Botham repeatedly asked Chappell to stop criticising England, before throwing a punch. The pair were pulled apart but continued to trade insults for years, with Botham saying of Chappell: 'As a human being, he is a non-entity.'

PONTING RUN-OUT - AUSTRALIAN CAPTAIN SNAPS ON LIVE TVAustralian captain Ricky Ponting was feeling the pressure during the 2005 Ashes series, and he finally snapped when he was run out by England substitute fielder Gary Pratt at Trent Bridge. As he left the field Ponting screamed and swore up at the England dressing room, accusing them of using a specialist replacement. England won by three wickets.

SNOW JOKE - ENGLAND BOWLER ATTACKED OVER AGGRESSIVE PLAY
  England bowler John Snow was warned 
for short-pitched bowling after striking Australian batsman Terry Jenner
 on the head during the 1970-71 Ashes encounter in Melbourne. Snow was 
jostled by a fan and had bottles thrown at him before captain Ray 
Illingworth led England from the field in protest. They eventually 
returned to win by 62 runs and regain the Ashes.

LILLEE'S METAL BAT - AUSSIE STAR ATTEMPTS TO BEND THE RULESDennis Lillee walked out with a controversial metal bat in the middle of the 1979 Ashes test in Perth. Although it was clearly a publicity stunt and did little to boost Lillee's batting, the bat provoked a furious reaction from England captain Mike Brearley and led to a lengthy discussion over its legality by the umpires before the match was allowed to continue.
