A schoolboy who leaped into a river to save his dog from drowning brought his pet back to life by giving him the kiss of life.

Dean Allen, 15, risked his own life to haul his lifeless Staffordshire Bull Terrier Bronk from the water on to the river bank.

But when his pet showed no signs of life, Dean began pumping his chest and breathing into his nose after remembering lessons he learned from attending first aid classes.

Just moments later the 10-year-old dog was breathing again.

Dean was with a friend walking by the side of the River Ryton near his home in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, when Bronk, jumped into the water.

As his head dipped under the water Dean leapt into action diving into the river to grab the drowning animal. But there was more drama as Bronk's lead became entangled with debris.

'Bronk was by my side but he saw another dog by the river bank and suddenly jumped into the water,' said Dean, a pupil at Worksop's Portland School.

'The lead was still around his neck and he went under water. I didn't stop to think, I just jumped in and swam over to him but his lead was caught, so I tried to get him free and eventually I was able to pull him up.

'He didn't appear to be breathing, I've been going to First Aid classes with St John Ambulance since October, and I've learnt how to give CPR so I just went through the procedure.

Dean's mother Julie, 47, said:Â  'At first I thought he was making the story up when he came home, but when I saw Bronk he did look ill.

'I am just so proud of my son for what he has done, he was at danger going in the water.

'Bronk was under for a long time, when my son eventually got him out, he was lifeless so he had to start pumping his chest.

'Bronk threw up some water and it saved his life. We kept an eye on him and then took him to the vets where he was kept in an oxygen tent. He was given medication and he is recovering well.'

Dean said: 'Bronk is one of the family so I had to save him. He is not as bouncy as he normally is but he is on the mend. I'll make sure when we're out again that we steer clear of any water.'
