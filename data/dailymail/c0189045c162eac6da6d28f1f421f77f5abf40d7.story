A woman who has battled severe anorexia for 30 years is finally in recovery and has made it her mission to help others struggling with the same issue.

Danielle Buettner, 36, from Lawrence, Kansas, was admitted to a hospice two years ago and given just six months to live, weighing in at the time at just 56lbs.

Now, at 99lbs, she is finally at a low but healthy weight range for the first time in her life, and she's determined to open people's eyes to the life-destroying nature of eating disorders.

Telling her story: Ms Buettner  is proud to be in recovery and at 99lbs, heavier than she has ever been

'The osteoporosis, I'll never be able to 
have children, I do have a pacemaker,' she told Fox4kc.

Ms
 Buettner says childhood abuse sparked her unhealthy eating habits at 
the tender age of six, but she wasn't diagnosed until age 12.

'I would watch 
people eat, I would make food for other people, and I would go to the 
refrigerator and smell food and that was enough for me,' she admitted.

In a video from just a year ago, the petite blonde's sunken cheeks and protruding bones are shockingly apparent. 'I weighed 56lbs, and I knew that I needed to get better,' she said.

Weak: Ms Buettner's anorexia caused her to suffer respiratory failure and a two-week coma. Today she wears a pacemaker, suffers from osteoporosis, and will never be able to have children (pictured a year ago)

Her poor health was such that it caused her to go into respiratory failure and slip into a coma for two weeks. She also had to be intubated six times.

But with the help of her peer support specialist Lindsay Munson, she has been able to overcome her disorder slowly and begin the process of recovery.

These days, while she's still considered underweight, Ms Buettner is proud to be in recovery and heavier than she has ever been.

Her goal now is to become a peer mentor and help others overcome their eating disorders. 'Look how close to death I was, look how far I've come,' she said. 'And you can do it too.'
