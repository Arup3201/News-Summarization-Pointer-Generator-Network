Internet mogul Kim Dotcom says he is broke and facing jail in New Zealand

Internet mogul Kim Dotcom, accused of pocketing more than $175 million from pirated copies of movies and other material, claims he is broke and facing jail in New Zealand.

In a live video link from his multi-million dollar mansion, the German-born entrepreneur said he had no money left to defend himself at a bail hearing in Auckland.

'I'm defenseless and they're using that opportunity to try and get my bail revoked and that's what I'm facing on Thursday,' Dotcom said in the link to to the UnBound Digital conference in England.

'This might be my last public appearance and if I go back to jail you can tell everybody that was the one,' he added.

The mogul, whose New Zealand lawyers recently quit, claimed he has spent $10million on legal costs since he was arrested in a dramatic police helicopter swoop on his mansion in January 2012.

'They have certainly managed to drain my resources,' he said.

Dotcom is fighting extradition to the United States, facing charges in what prosecutors say is one of the biggest criminal copyright theft cases ever brought.

Police seized millions of pounds, a vast collection of luxury cars and sawn-off shotguns when they raided the mansion, and officers had to cut their way in to arrest the mogul after he retreated into a fortified safe room.

The Megaupload operation at the center of the piracy accusations is a Hong Kong-based ‘cyberlocker’ service that allows users to download pirated films, TV shows, music and e-books with just a few clicks. 

It has been shut down, and Dotcom said shares in his new data storage company Mega were held in trust by his wife and children. He and his wife separated earlier this year. 

Dotcom, who was born Kim Schmitz, was granted New Zealand residency despite his criminal background after investing £8million in government bonds and making a generous donation to the Christchurch earthquake fund.

He said he also regretted dabbling in politics when he invested several million dollars in a new political party which failed to win a seat in New Zealand's September general election.

'Before I started my political movement, I was quite popular in New Zealand. Everyone was cheering for me to win my case,' he said.

'But after I got involved in politics and the prime minister and his party attacked me viciously, labelling me as a Nazi and saying I'm only going into politics to stop my extradition, well the New Zealand public heard that narrative and now I'm a pariah.

'The witch-hunt worked, everyone wants to see me burn, and on Thursday I might go to jail because of that.'

He also admitted his flamboyance made him an easy target.

'When you travel around on private jets and you go around with cars that have number plates saying 'God', 'Stoned' and 'Mafia' on them, it's probably not the best for keeping a low profile.'

The US Justice Department and FBI claim Megaupload and related sites netted more than $175 million in criminal proceeds, and cost copyright owners more than $500 million by offering pirated copies of movies, TV shows and other content.

Megaupload was unique not only because of its massive size and the volume of downloaded content, but also because it had high-profile support from celebrities, musicians and other content producers who are most often the victims of copyright infringement and piracy.

Before the site was taken down, it posted a statement saying allegations that it facilitated massive breaches of copyright laws were ‘grotesquely overblown’. 

Megaupload is considered a 'cyberlocker', in which users can upload and transfer files that are too large to send by email. Such sites can have perfectly legitimate uses.

But the MPAA, which has campaigned for a crackdown on piracy, alleged that the vast majority of content being shared on Megaupload was in violation of copyright laws.

The website allowed users to download films, TV shows, games, music and other content for free, but made money by charging subscriptions to people who wanted access to faster download speeds or extra content.

The website also sold advertising. Several sister sites were also shut down, including one dedicated to sharing pornography files. 

The Megaupload homepage, which has now been taken down, boasted the endorsement of a string of high-profile celebrities
