Speeding across a lake clinging to a 
wakeboard towed by a speedboat might not sound like a particularly 
promising spot for a proposal but for one extreme sports enthusiast, it 
was perfect.

From his 
precarious perch, surfer Matt Gencarella, 21, from Idaho, popped the 
question to his girlfriend Brynn Hathaway, 21 - and amazingly, she said 
yes.

Matt even managed to go down on one knee despite the wobbling wakeboard being towed at a hair raising 25 miles per hour.

Surprise! Matt gives a relieved thumbs up in the wake of the proposal that took Brynn (right) totally by surprise

When she said yes, he swept her up in a bear hug before leaping overboard.

'He told me to take the rope and said, "whatever you do, do not let go of the this",' revealed an overjoyed Brynn.

'He said he was going to try a new trick. Then he turned around and got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.

'I had no idea that I would be getting proposed to on a surfboard, I just thought it as a normal day on the lake.

'We
have been wakeboarding and surfing together since we were 12 years old,
so the proposal was incredibly meaningful to the both of us.'

'I
wasn't worried about falling off,' added new fiance Matt. 'All I could 
think of was how I was going to ask Brynn to spend the rest of her life 
with me. That was all that mattered in the moment.'

The pair met at a gymnastics class when they were 11 years old and have been wakeboarding together since they were 12.Â 

But
despite his skills on the water, Matt still had a few nerves to 
overcome and admitted he found the proposal far scarier than his 
daredevil stunt.

'I jumped into the water and said "Brynn, let's double up",' he explained. 'I was nervous as we were towed along, waiting to get up and start wakeboarding.

'Once we were up, it was like nothing mattered anymore because I was about to take one of the biggest steps in my life.'

The couple grew up together 
near the lake in Coer d'Alene in Idaho, USA, and say wakeboarding is one
of their favourite summer watersports.

'I
was racking my brain to figure out a fun and unique way of proposing to
her,' added Matt. 'I didn't want to do something cliched.'

After
hitting on the wakeboarding idea, recent graduate Matt set about 
planning the proposal, with best friend Corey Schneider standing in for 
Brynn during a practice run.

'Corey
and I practiced for an hour,' the romantic watersports aficionado 
explained. 'We went through every scenario of how she might react and 
what I would do in each situation.

'I
told Brynn that Corey's watersports company, Hayden Wake, was going to 
shoot a promotional video and they wanted to film us wakeboarding - that
was the decoy.'

The decoy provided a perfect excuse for the presence of a camera which was filming the couple as they headed out onto the lake.

Despite the potential for a 
very public humiliation, confident Matt also invited friends and family 
to share in the special moment.

'The
day before, I called Brynn's two best friends from school to come up 
and surprise her so that they could be there for the event,' he said.

'One of the most important things for me was that our close friends and family were there for the proposal.

'I told Brynn that our parents and friends wanted to watch us being filmed, so they were on a boat off to the side.

'I
could not have been happier with how it all went. The joy we shared in 
that moment with each other, and our family and friends, was priceless.'

The
proposal, which happened last month, was captured by photographer 
Christine Woeller and a video shot by the wakeboarding company has been 
viewed over a million times since it was posted online last week.

Brynn and Matt plan to get married at the end of August next year in Coer d'Alene.

'I
have known that I wanted to marry Matthew since I was 17, so I am 
thrilled that we are getting married next year,' added Brynn.

'He is really so wonderful and thoughtful, I feel like a very lucky girl.'
