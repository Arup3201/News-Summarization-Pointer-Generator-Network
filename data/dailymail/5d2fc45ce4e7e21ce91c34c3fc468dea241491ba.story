A gang of teenage boys had sex with a drunk 14-year-old girl in a park which they filmed on a mobile phone, a court has heard.

The group of three boys, aged 15 to 18, denied raping the girl but admitted sexual activity with a child.

Worcester Crown Court heard the youths, all from Droitwich in Worcestershire, had sex with the girl in a park in the town on September 24 last year, while another filmed it on a phone.

Scene of the crime: Three teenage boys admitted sexual activity with a drunk 14-year-old girl while another youth filmed the incident on a mobile phone in Lido Park, Droitwich, pictured above

The court heard the girl consented to 'the initiation of sexual contact' but denied consenting to sex.

However, rape charges were dropped after the judge said it would be 'undesirable' for the youngsters to face a trial.

James Rogers, 18, pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child.

Two 16-year-old boys and a 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also admitted to one count of sexual activity with a child.

The original charges of rape and aiding and abetting rape were not proceeded with.

One youth who filmed the incident had earlier admitted to making indecent images.

In court: The teenagers will appear back at Worcester Crown Court in December for sentencing

James Dunstan. prosecuting, told the court the victim was called into trees in the park by one of the youths and they kissed each other.

He added: 'But afterwards, it rapidly escalated. She had drunk very significant amounts of vodka, just under half a litre.

'Twenty to thirty minutes later, when she went into the lido park, she was passing out. Her capacity to consent was impaired.'

Judge John Cavell said it was 'undesirable' to hold a trial because the defendants did not have police records.

He granted the four teenagers bail and ordered them to return to court on December 17 for sentencing.

Judge Cavell will watch the sex video before sentencing.
