A stranger turned up at a young woman's home and confessed that he had killed her sister four years earlier in a hit-and-run.

David H McCarthy, 27, came to the door of Michelle Lech early on Sunday morning and asked if he could speak to her. He then calmly sat at her kitchen table and confessed to the fatal accident.

Melissa Lech, 20, was struck and killed on August 7, 2008 as she walked home from a restaurant in Joliet, Illinois.

McCarthy had tracked down the dead woman's sister over the internet. His motive is unclear.

When he left, she called Detective John Ross, who has been involved in the case from the beginning, and told him about the visit.

After running the licence plate she had noted down, Detective Ross was able to locate the 27-year-old in the nearby town of Naperville.

Police went to McCarthy's home where he appeared to be waiting for officers. His family, who were unaware of the accident, were 'deeply distressed' at the pain caused to the Lech family, according to the Chicago Tribune. 

McCarthy has been charged with causing personal injury and leaving the scene of an accident causing a death. He is being held on $1million bail.

Prosecutors said today that McCarthy admitted to Lech’s sister that he stopped after hitting the 20-year-old student and knew she was seriously injured but drove off because he was scared.

According to court documents, the 27-year-old was charged with a DUI 18 months after the fatal hit-and-run. He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and was ordered to attend counseling for substance abuse and mental health issues.

He was also arrested for domestic battery in 2009.

Miss Lech also lost her father several years ago to brain cancer.

She told the Chicago-Tribune: 'I don’t know what 
kind of person he is, but it’s evident, after it took
him four years to come forward.

'He left my sister in the street to die and he had four years to 
think about what he was going to say about what he did.'

She refused to elaborate further on a possible explanation for why he had now come forward.

Melissa Lech, who had been about to start at the University of Illinois, had gone to watch a White Sox baseball game with friends on August 6, 2008 before the group headed to a sports bar in Joliet.

After an argument with a friend, she left the bar shortly after midnight. She was hit by a car and run over at 12.20 am.

Another
motorist who arrived shortly after the fatal accident said he saw 
tail lights swerving before coming across Miss Lech's body and 
calling 911.

Police canvassed the area, looked at 
cell phone usage and spoke to dozens of residents in the area but no 
leads emerged.

Melissa's mother and Crimestoppers offered a $25,000 
reward for information.

Last September, NASCAR driver Kevin Conway carried a giant picture of Melissa on his race car with a fresh appeal and tipline for information.

At the time, Detective Ross said: 'We believe somebody out there … knows information in this case.

'It’s just a matter of being honest and coming forward to give closure to the family.'
