Barack Obama may have won another four years as president, but it's his wife Michelle that may lead the country beyond his second term if Samuel L. Jackson has his way.

The Snakes on a Plane star got behind the first lady in a recent interview, saying that Michelle Obama would make a fine president - or a Supreme Court justice 'if she wants.'

Despite little indication that she has political aspirations - not to mention that the next election is four years away - Mrs Obama is getting support for her own White House run.

Political advice: Samuel L. Jackson, who handled superheroes as Nick Fury in The Avengers, says Michelle Obama is 'superwoman'

Jackson, who starred as Nick Fury in the Summer blockbuster The Avengers, told Newsweek: 'Michelle is Superwoman. What can’t she do? That's why people love her.'

'She can be on the Supreme Court and anywhere else she wants. She can be the president. She's history and she'll stay history because she is so amazingly smart and together.'

And the Pulp Fiction star is not alone.

Rep James Clyburn, a Democrat from South Carolina, told the magazine: 'I'd love to see her get more into politics because it would be a breath of fresh air in DC.'

He added: 'She's honest and 
straightforward, which is not what you see in Washington much. She is 
exactly what we need around here.'

While Jackson and Clyburn may be getting excited about Mrs Obama's political future, experts say it's simply not going to happen.

Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, told Newsweek: 'Nothing she’s done indicates she wants more power on the national or international front. Yet everyone else says she has to have it.'

An unnamed White House official speaking exclusively to the magazine added that Mrs. Obama has no interest in pursuing an elected office.

The official said: 'Michelle Obama doesn’t have the temperament for the constant b.s. that goes on in D.C. She watched her husband fight fights that he shouldn't have to.

'She's seen the ugly side of Washington up close and personal and has no interest in dealing with that firsthand. I think she knows there are other ways to impact the system from the outside in.'

Wearing a stunning Michael Kors gold lamé dress embellished at the neckline, the first lady dazzled as she entered the East Room of the White House with her husband for Sunday night’s Kennedy Center Honors.

Mr Obama honored seven of the country’s most influential artists, including Dustin Hoffman, Chicago bluesman Buddy Guy, late night host David Letterman, ballerina Natalia Markarova, and surviving members of rock band Led Zeppelin.
