At the final whistle, a gentleman behind the press box cursed loudly and luridly. The small boy alongside him tugged at the sleeve of his overcoat: ‘Can we go home now, Dad? Can we, Dad? Pleeeese!’ And as we sat in the freezing dusk of London SE7, struggling to take in a terrible football match, all our sympathy went out to the child.

Charlton fans are a tolerant lot. They always have been. But the boos and jeers which rang around The Valley at full-time after a 1-1 draw were seething with well-founded frustration. They were enjoying a perfectly outrageous lead through Jordan Cousins going into the second minute of added time, when they collectively backed off a woefully ordinary Rotherham side, allowing them to attack at will. The equalising goal from the substitute Danny Ward was the entirely predictable outcome.

Both sides are involved in what the sporting prints used to term ‘a relegation dogfight’. There are seasons when football fans yearn for mid-table mediocrity, and for Charlton fans, this is just such a season. Charlton have not won at home since the end of October. They have won nowhere since early November, and have now drawn 15 of their 28 Championship matches. Small wonder that the fans’ charity is wearing thin.

Charlton boss Guy Luzon took charge of his first home match since taking over the reins at The Valley

The Addicks react after conceding a late goal against Rotherham on Saturday afternoon

Jordan Cousins had put Charlton in the lead during the 83rd minute of the Championship encounter 

Guy Luzon is their fourth manager within the past 12 months. This was his first home game in charge, and within 61 minutes, those tolerant fans were chanting ‘You don’t know what you’re doing!’ This may well be a new English record.

Summing up his debut last week, Luzon said: ‘The first thing we needed to stop was conceding goals. After that, we need to score.’ Saturday night, he was singing a similar song. These are early days, of course, but I fear he is unlikely to stay long enough to collect a testimonial.

If I seem concerned, then I confess all. For the best part of half a century, I have observed the code of neutrality when covering football matches. Saturday, the final assignment, I shamelessly cast it aside.

Like most fans of clubs like Charlton, I hope for the best but know that the worst is on its way. Even when things were going well, during those years in the first half of the noughties, when Alan Curbishley was keeping us in the Premier League, we knew it was only a matter of time. And so it proved.

The club is now owned by a chap who is apparently the 18th richest man in Belgium. This would be encouraging if Standard Liege were not his passion and Charlton his London bit on the side.

The result is a football club which seems curiously unloved and under invested. Of course, we have known far worse times than this. Extended banishment to the dreaded Selhurst Park was once the only antidote to closure. 

Charlton have struggled to replace former boss Alan Curbishley, who left in 2006

It took perhaps the finest, most resourceful supporter involvement that the English game has ever seen to eventually negotiate a return to The Valley. By comparison, these are almost halcyon days. But it didn’t feel like that on Saturday.

The match programme, featuring a cover picture of Clive Mendonca only made things worse, with its memories of better days. May 25, 1998, most Charlton fans could recall that date as readily as their own birthday. The best match ever staged at Wembley; including the ’66 World Cup final, the ’53 Stanley Matthews final, the lot. And Mendonca scored a sensational hat-trick, as Charlton clawed their way back time and again to secure a 4-4 draw. Thirteen penalties later, they beat Sunderland to enter the Premier League.

Under Alan Curbishley, it was the Charlton version of a golden age. It seemed an eternity ago, as Luzon bounded along the touchline, waving a hand, bawling unheard into the middle distance. I doubt that Curbishley would have bounded quite so pointlessly, nor that other Charlton managers of yore — Theo Foley, Lennie Lawrence, Eddie Firmani and others — would have gone ignored. Still, the fate of the Charlton follower is to look back at the way things were.

And here's what The Valley or SE7, as it is also known, looked like back in the 1950s 

The young local reporters present were far more sanguine than we veterans on Saturday. I envied their confidence, their assumption that things would work out fine. Back in the Stone Ages, I used to cover the occasional Charlton match for the local paper. In my second or third game, as a novice reporter, I described a Charlton centre half as ‘The finest in the Second Division’. The Sports Editor was a kind man. ‘I take it you’ve seen all the others?’ he enquired. Naturally, I hadn’t. He smiled, and sent me off to make the office tea.

After so many years, I have learned the danger of such sweeping judgements, yet still there is the conviction that what can go wrong, will go utterly wrong where Charlton are concerned.

And yet, as the followers of such football clubs will tell you, it isn’t the despair that gets to you; it’s the hope.

For all the disappointments  at The Valley, all the evidence of a team in tatters, we cling to that hope in the face of form and logic. Neutrality is now forgotten. The next stage is a return to partisan status. Unashamed.

Meanwhile, on the far side of London, over to the west, an oligarch’s whimsical investment was preparing to play a sheik’s vanity project.

Stamford Bridge is 12 miles from The Valley. For all they now have in common, it may as well be on the moon. And yet, we wouldn’t swap it for all the oil in Arabia. For SE7 is home. And home is where the heart is.
