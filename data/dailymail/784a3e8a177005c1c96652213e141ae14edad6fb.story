An Illinois woman who became pregnant just six months after she underwent a tubal ligation in 2008 and gave birth to a baby girl with sickle cell disease is now suing her doctor for 'wrongful pregnancy.'

While a small percentage of women become pregnant after getting their tubes tied, Cynthia Williams' situation was all the more shocking because she had just a single ovary and she believes the doctor may have cauterized the wrong falopian tube.

Williams was further dismayed after she experienced congestive heart failure following the pregnancy she didn't believe could happen and now the 44-year-old mother wants money for  the 'extraordinary' medical expenses she says she'll incur as she raises Kennadi, who is now 4.

'I love Kennadi with all my heart...But it¿s been a life change for everybody': Cynthia Williams (right) is suing the doctor she says fouled up her tubal ligation, leading to her pregnancy with Kennadi (left), who is now 4 and living with sickle cell disease

Williams is suing Dr. Byron A. Rosner, MD of Reproductive Health Associates for 'wrongful pregnancy' and wants damages and money for her daughter's many medical expenses

'I was livid,' Williams recelled to ABCnews.com about the moment her pregnancy test came back positive. 'I just lost it.'

Williams had several reasons to be dismayed.

She and her husband had decided to stop having babies after three because they both carry the genetic trait for sickle cell and had already had one child with the full blown disease.

'I just wanted to get my tubes tied,'
 Williams said. And she did just that with Dr. Byron Rosner of 
Reproductive Health Associates in Hazel Crest.

Except she only technically needed one tube tied. Williams had her right ovary removed at the age of 12 due to a cyst.

Despite that, in 2010 Williams gave birth to her daughter Kennadi.

Kennadi
 had sickle cell disease, but Williams was unable to take care of her 
because he suffered congestive heart failure 
after the little girl's birth by c-section.

Tubal ligation is a permanent procedure used to prevent pregnancy.

The fallopian tubes are cauterized, cut and/or tie to prevent the sperm and the egg from meeting.

While rare, pregnancy can occur after the procedure.

Failure occurs in between 2-10 out of every 1,000 tubal ligations

'This is 
right after I have a baby that I still can’t believe I had,' she told 
ABC. 'I couldn’t be with my baby because I was too sick.'

Williams spent two weeks in intensive care and missed work for a total of nine months.

She
 filed suit against Dr. Byron Rosner in 2010.

Last month an 
appellate court ruled that the state could go forward despite a move to 
dismiss by Rosner's attorney's.

'Having
 a baby after a sterilization procedure is something that happens,' said
 Williams’ attorney, Beverly Spearman.

But then Spearman learned that Williams' only had one ovary and started to see the case differently.

'When I found out more about the 
whole story, I said, "OK, let’s move forward. Let’s see where this 
goes."'

According to medical records obtained by ABC, Rosner 'tied,' 'excised' and 'cauterized' Williams' right falopian tube.

However, her right ovary had been removed.

'She is the absolute love of my life, but it¿s hard': Cynthia and her husband both have the sickle cell genetic train, not the disease. which means each of their children was born with a 25 percent chance of having sickle cell disease. After one of their other children ( now ages 25, 21 and 17) was born with the painful illness, they decided to stop having children...then little Kennadi came along

The records reportedly indicate that her left tube was intact and 'normal in appearance.'

Rosner's
 attorney Todd Stalmck told ABC that his client 'complied with the 
standard of care' in performing Williams' tubal ligation.

But his former patient disagrees and now wants damages for 'personal injury to her, emotional distress, and for lost wages' and medical costs from Rosner.

'It’s
 not fair,' Williams said. 'She is the absolute love of my life, but 
it’s hard. Sometimes people think I’m her grandmother.'

SICKLE CELL DISEASE

Sickle cell disease demands immediate treatment for babies.

About 80,000 Americans have sickle cell disease, in which oxygen-carrying hemoglobin clumps inside red blood cells, turning them into a sickle shape that can't squeeze through tiny blood vessels.

That causes pain, infections and eventually life-threatening organ damage.

SICKLE CELL TRAIT

Sickle cell trait is different. More than 2.5 million Americans have it, meaning they carry one copy of the abnormal hemoglobin gene, not the two needed to cause full disease. 

Babies from couples who both have the trait, like Cynthia and Kenneth, have a 25 percent chance of having sickle cell disease.

Trait carriers only occasionally experience health problems, like blood in the urine, some blood clumping at high altitudes and in athletes — in which intense exercise can cause blood cells to sickle enough to block blood flow to muscles, which rapidly break down.

Sickle cell is most common in black Americans — about 10% have the trait — and also in people of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Central and South American ancestry.
