Labour is ‘playing politics with prosperity’ by refusing to give full backing to the planned High Speed 2 railway, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will say today.

Ministers will seek to demonstrate their commitment to the £50billion project this week by unveiling plans to extend it all the way to Scotland.

But Mr McLoughlin will warn that the plans will face the axe unless Ed Miliband’s party shows ‘resolution’ and backs them.

The Transport Secretary will criticise Labour for failing its own politicians in the North and Midlands by refusing to fully back the £50bn project claiming it would bring the areas economic benefits

The Government will present a new business case for HS2 today in a report arguing that the new line – from London to Birmingham and on to Leeds and Manchester – is vital for economic growth in the North of England.

The report will warn that ditching HS2 and upgrading existing lines instead could lead to 14 years of disruption on the railways.

The study, compiled by Network Rail, warns that a ‘very unattractive’ package of closures, diversions and delays would be needed.

The report – the latest attempt to persuade a sceptical public that the plans are vital for national renewal – will present a new cost-benefit analysis of the scheme.

Labour MPs are expected to abstain in a Commons vote on Thursday designed to pave the way for HS2 amid signs that Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls wants to withdraw the party’s backing and spend the money on something else.

But in a speech to launch the report, Mr McLoughlin will say: ‘Big projects need “broad political consensus” as well as “resolution” from political leaders.

‘That’s why the new north-south railway must be a national project with broad support across parties, or in the end it will be nothing.’

He will warn Mr Miliband that undermining the project has already angered Labour council leaders in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Sheffield.

Mr McLoughlin will say: ‘They know that any threat to the new line is also a threat to the future of the North and the Midlands, to the Britain beyond London.’

Confronting the Labour leadership, he will argue: ‘You can’t say one day you back better infrastructure, only the next threaten to stop it being built.

The scheme has encountered opposition from both Tory and Labour politicians over the cost and route

‘You can’t go on claiming to want one nation if you won’t back  the things that will bring it  together. You can’t play politics with our prosperity.’

Last night Labour MP Graham Stringer said his party’s leaders ‘should stop playing games’.

He added: ‘It was a Labour project, announced by a Labour government, and they should be supporting it.’

In a clear sign that the Coalition is committed to the project, Lib Dem transport minister Baroness Kramer will on Friday announce the start of a study to work out the costs and benefits of extending it to Scotland.

Under the existing plans, the HS2 line will run from London to Birmingham, before splitting towards Manchester and Leeds.

Department for Transport sources said extending it could mean the two lines going on to Glasgow and Edinburgh.

HS2 has been beset by claims that the £42billion cost of the English lines and the £8billion required for rolling stock could end up soaring to £80billion.

Mr McLoughlin will say the Government delivered the Channel Tunnel rail link and the Olympics on time and on budget.

However, the ability of his department is called into question by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in a report on the £3.55billion Thameslink rail project.

It questions the way the DfT tackled the cross-London project, due for completion in 2018.

The report says the award of a £1.6billion private finance contract for new trains for Thameslink was delayed by more than three years and that passengers had to wait for around 30 years for the scheme to go ahead.

The committee concluded: ‘We remain concerned about the department’s skills and capacity to complete Thameslink by 2018, alongside its ambitious wider portfolio of programmes and projects.’

The committee also expressed concern that a senior member of the Thameslink team was moving to the HS2 scheme, saying the DfT ‘suffers from a shortage of strong project-management skills’.
