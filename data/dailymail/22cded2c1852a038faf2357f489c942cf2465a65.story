The AFL has called play-on with an ambitious plan to see an Australia-wide women's competition, with the first bounce to potentially come as early as 2017. 

AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan wants a national review into second-tier football that gets underway next month to include the launch of a women's competition in its discussions. 

Nearly $80 million is spent on the second-tier, the level directly under the AFL, each season. League executives Mark Evans and Dorothy Hisgrove will lead the review, which will explore how that money is spent and look into ways to 'footify' more women, children and multicultural communities.

Participation rate in women's competition have soared, with Victoria 52 teams playing across seven divisions in Victoria. 

AFL Media Relations Manager Patrick Keane said it was a 'personal goal' of CEO Gillon McLachlan to have a women's competition in two years, and said 2020 was the 'very latest' the AFL would want it introduced.

AFL Victoria competition manager of women's football Darren Flanigan said a national women's football league would be great for the sport.

'It'd be fantastic for women's footy,' Mr Flanigan said.

'It would really raise the profile of the competition, and bring a much deserved increase in recognition for players. 

'Also, if it stopped being an amateur league and players were paid as semi-professionals or professionals, that'd be great.'

AFL Media said it is a 'personal goal' of CEO Gillon McLachlan to have a national women's competition get underway in 2017. 

Mr Flanigan said the sport is in a boom period of growth, and is expected to continue into the future.

'We have nine new clubs and an increase of more than 30 per cent in participation,' he said.

'That sort of growth is something we have been seeing for a few years now. We'd expect it to continue in 2015, and even get a bit stronger.'

Mr Flanigan said popularity is not only increasing across the country, but across all ages levels.

'The growth is coming all the way through from Auskick and right up through the junior levels and into the open-age leagues,' he said.

'Every state now has a female competition and most have a second division.'

AFL Victoria competition manager of women's football Darren Flanigan said numbers are expected to increase further in the coming years. 

However, he would not comment on any potential funding wish-lists, and said that is 'a decision for the AFL'.

'What we are all about is creating a strong, positive environment for women who want to get out there and have a kick of the footy.' 

The AFL has taken steps forward in recent years in relation to including more women in the game, with St Kilda's Peta Searle becoming the league's first full-time assistant coach last year. in 2013, Richmond appointed Peggy O'Neal the first female club president.
