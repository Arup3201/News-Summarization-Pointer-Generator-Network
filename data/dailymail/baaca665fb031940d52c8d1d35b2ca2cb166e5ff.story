Posing in an evening dress at the Houses of Parliament or stripping down to her swimsuit on national TV, Nadine Dorries has always made the most of her glamorous looks.

But these days the 56-year-old MP is  far from confident when she gazes in the mirror.

Yesterday she spoke frankly of her battle with alopecia, the auto-immune condition that has left her hair falling out.

Miss Dorries, one of David Cameron’s 
most rebellious MPs, told how she had first realised she was losing hair
 when in the shower.

Then she noticed a distinct bald patch at the back of her head when she saw herself on camera in a TV interview.

‘The worst part is every single morning when you get up and look in the mirror,’ she said yesterday.

‘That actually does make you cry every 
morning, so that’s the worst part because it’s a bit like your 
femininity is going down the shower, it’s going down the plug hole.

‘I’m terrified it’s going to get worse, 
because it’s actually getting so thin. I’m actually really worried it’s 
going to get worse.’

Miss Dorries said a woman’s hair, just 
like breasts, were obvious signs of her femininity.

Nadine Dorries said: 'Women who suffer from mastectomies, I
 think, go through the same confidence-draining loss because what 
defines you as a woman is disappearing'

She said she could 
identify with the loss of confidence often felt by women who have 
mastectomies. ‘I realised that when men go bald and when they lose their
 hair, what they tend to do is have a mid-life crisis and go out and 
have an affair but what women tend to do is to actually go into their 
houses and lock the door,’ she said.

‘Everything’s against you and you’re losing your femininity. 

‘You’re losing your confidence and 
you’re losing your ability to go out and actually face the world because
 you think what identifies a woman are her hair and her breasts.

‘Women who suffer from mastectomies, I 
think, go through the same confidence-draining loss because what defines
 you as a woman is disappearing.’ Miss Dorries, the MP for 
Mid-Bedfordshire, started treatment for alopecia yesterday.

‘There is 
help available, you can do something – I’m going at 10.30 this morning 
to a clinic to have my first treatments,’ she told ITV’s Daybreak show .

Miss Dorries has had a colourful  career since she was elected in 2005.

She was suspended from the Tory party 
last November after she took time out of Westminster to appear on the 
ITV show I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here! in the Australian jungle.

She also got in hot water for describing
 David Cameron and George Osborne as ‘arrogant posh boys who don’t know 
the price of milk’.

An estimated 8 million women in the UK have hair loss (medically known 
as alopecia), and it can lead to loss of self-confidence and heightened 
self-consciousness, according to the NHS.

Hair loss is a well-known side effect of chemotherapy, and around 50 per cent
 of women lose more hair than usual after they've given birth

Jackie McKillop, Alopecia UK spokesperson and junior nursing sister at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, told nhs.co.uk:

'For women, there is a social stigma attached to going bald,' she says. 'Hair loss can affect your sensuality and how you perceive yourself. There are usually emotional trials and tribulations when it happens.

'Some women question whether their partner will still love them, while I've known others become socially reclusive and give up enjoyable activities like swimming and going to the gym because they can't bear using the communal changing rooms for fear of their hair loss being discovered.'

An estimated eight million women in the UK suffer from hair loss, for reasons including pregnancy, stress, medication or weight loss

TYPES OF HAIR LOSS

Telogen effluvium

General shedding and thinning of the hair. It usually occurs a few months after a shock to the system, such as extreme stress, fever, childbirth, sudden weight loss, an operation or as a reaction to medication. The hair loss is usually temporary.

Female-pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia)

Hair gradually thins, often from the top of the head. It usually gets more noticeable after the menopause and tends to run in families.

Alopecia areata

Affects mostly teenagers and young adults. Hair loss is patchy and linked to a problem with the immune system. The hair follicles are not permanently damaged, and in many cases hair grows back in a few months.

Alopecia totalis

Complete loss of hair on the head. Regrowth is unlikely.

Alopecia universalis

Total loss of head and body hair.
