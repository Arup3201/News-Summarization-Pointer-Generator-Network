They are the brother and sister of all families. For the Cleaver siblings have a combined age of 1,092.

Ranging from 68 to 89, they are now hoping to be recognised by Guinness World Records as the oldest set of siblings in the world.

The Cleavers are the children of Leicester butcher Rowland and wife Emma. Their first child, Jack, died aged 80 in 2000.

Meet the family: Back row, from left; Shirley, 77, Wendy, 70, Sandra, 71, Pauline, 79, Valerie, 72, Jennifer, 76, Gillian, 74. Front row: Rowland, 83, Joan, 85, Betty, 86, Sylvia, 80, Michael, 68

The 12 pictured still live in the Leicester area, while Margaret, who will be 90 next month, and Barbara, 82, live in New Zealand.

Between them they have 36 children and 57 grandchildren.

Pauline Cavner, 79, is the eighth eldest and recalls her mother dressing up the seven middle sisters in identical embroidered dresses for Sunday School.

‘She loved children, and she loved having us all’, Mrs Cavner said.

‘We had beautiful matching dresses on each week for Sunday school.

‘We
 all looked out for each other as a group and being the middle child 
with seven siblings on each side, I was lucky that I got on with the 
elder ones and the younger ones.

‘One
 of my best memories was when my parents hosted an evacuee child during 
the war – she joined our household of fifteen children in four bedrooms 
having singing competitions at night, and she loved it.’

Last time the siblings were all together
 was 12 years ago -  the first time in 38 years - but it proved to be 
the final full reunion as eldest brother Jack died in 2000.

That was then: The Cleaver family pictured in 1959.

Despite
 this and the fact that two of the siblings, Barbara, 82, and Margaret, 
89, emigrated to New Zealand, the remaining 12 Cleaver siblings live 
locally and see each other regularly.

Shirley
 Pole,77; Wendy Woodward, 70; Sandra Randell,71; Pauline Cavner,79; 
Valerie Willcox,72;  Jennifer Andrews, 76; Gillian Freestone,74;  
Rowland Cleaver,83; Joan Hayden,85; Betty Kilby,86;Sylvia Dimmock,80 and
 Michael Cleaver, 68, all see each other every Christmas and at 
reunions.

Their parents 
Emma and Rowland were butchers in Leicester, but Mr Cleaver died when he
 was 50 and Mrs Cleaver survived him by 33 years.

‘I can always remember what my brother Rowland said when mum died’, Mrs Andrews recalled.

‘He said, “I hope this doesn’t mean we’ll break up, because our mother is the centre of the family.”

‘But we didn’t - we vowed to stay together as a family and every year since our mother died in 1986 we’ve had a family reunion.’

Last month the Mail reported on what was the world’s oldest family with a combined age of 855.

The family from Middlesbrough have 11 siblings ranging in age from 68 to 89, with 44 children between them.
