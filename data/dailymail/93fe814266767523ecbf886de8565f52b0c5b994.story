If Tom Pearce had any doubts about calling things off with Grace Andrews, he better look away now.

The TOWIE star has been unveiled as the face - and incredibly toned body - of a new swimwear brand and showcases her curves in the campaign imagery. 

Grace, 25, has been hand-picked by Bahimi swimwear to be the new 'body' of its campaign.

'Grace Andrews is currently the body of the campaign as she signifies the Bahimi brand - she has an amazing figure, she is friendly, down to earth and your typical girl next door, therefore she is the perfect candidate for us,' a spokesperson for the brand told MailOnline.

'At Bahimi we understand the female body shape and the designs create that perfect fit to show off your best features that celebrate a woman's figure.'

Bahimi swimwear aims to flatter the female silhouette and with its strong bold colours and glamorous embellishments, the designers say it's 'chic, fun and effortless'. 

And with her toned and tanned physique, Grace is certainly the perfect poster girl for the brand. 

Grace made her debut in the ITV2 show when the 11th series kicked off in February and has since been involved in all the Brentwood-based drama.

Her 'are they, aren't they' romance with co-star Tom Pearce was a focal point of the popular reality show but the pair have since called things off after she was rumoured to be seeing her ex.
