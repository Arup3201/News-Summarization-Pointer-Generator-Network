Larry Goodwin, who prefers to be called Sissy, is 67 years old with the build of a linebacker and a fondness for beer, barbecue and rodeo - as well as ruffled skirts and anything with a bow.

For years, Goodwin struggled with his compulsion to wear women's clothing, and living in Wyoming, the Cowboy State, with its attendant bigotry and intolerance, didn't help.

Whenever Goodwin tried to quash his urge to wear women's clothing - to deny what makes him him - he has suffered breakdowns, depression and suicidal thoughts.

Free spirit: The 67-year-old college science instructor Sissy Goodwin just prefers to do most things in a skirt

Many years ago, with the help of his wife Vickie and doctors, Goodwin came to understand his cross-dressing - and to accept himself.

But the same can't be said for Wyoming's conservative population.

When Goodwin began wearing skirts and blouses in public, he faced hostility at every turn, being kicked out of hotels, stores and restaurants and enduring public ridicule.

Despite its self-bestowed moniker, 'The Equality State,'  Goodwin says equality exists only for the majority.

Over the years, Goodwin has been beaten and insulted in public, but he says the worst pain has been from people he knows snubbing him in public, and knowing the embarrassment and shame his family has had to endure because of him.

'The physical wounds from a beating eventually heal,'he told the LA Times.

'But the pain of being shunned by people you know lasts a lifetime. It's worse than getting kicked in the kidney.'

Being who he is: Sissy Goodwin has spent 30 years fighting intolerance

'I’ve been arrested in Casper and Laramie for wearing a dress. I’ve been physically assaulted twice. Once in my own front yard I was kicked in the head. Several of my teeth were kicked in and bones were broken in my mouth,' he told the now-defunct Gender Public Advocacy Coalition.

'The other time was at the Kansas City Airport. This man just walked up and blind-sided me, just sucker-punched me. He split my ear wide open, and I was bleeding down the side of my head.'

More recently, he says, his own neighbor taunted him for his choice of clothing.

'I baited him - I admit it,' Goodwin told the LA Times, explaining that he asked the man whether he was a coward as well as a bigot.

'He punched me. I might have done the same thing.'

Family man: Goodwin is happily married to his wife of 45 years and the couple have two children

Goodwin grew up in the town of Douglas, Wyoming with an alcoholic mother and an abusive stepfather.

He told the LA Times that dressing up in girls clothing as a boy gave him 'a safety valve; an escape from a hostile environment.'

The compulsion continued into adulthood even as Goodwin became a real Wyoming man's man, competing in rodeos - albeit wearing ladies underpants beneath his chaps - and becoming an Air Force crew chief in the Vietnam War.

His secret was discovered while he was on duty in Vietnam when an officer caught sleeping in a pink nightgown. He was given an honorable discharge for the offense.

Accomplished: When Goodwin gained the confidence to be himself, he was able to build aircraft, gain a mathematics degree and become a teacher

Cross-dressing is still taboo, even in the country's most liberal cities, but in Wyoming, the country's least populated state, it's particularly loathsome and misunderstood.

Wyoming is the state in which college student Matthew Shepard was tortured and killed in 1998 for being gay.

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Sissy Goodwin has spent 30 years being exactly who he is.

His compulsion isn't linked in any way to his sexuality - Goodwin has been married to his wife Vickie for 45 years and the couple have two grown-up children.

Rather, he told the LA Times, it's something he calls gender independence: He just prefers to do most things in a dress.

When he was younger, Goodwin didn't know what to call his urge to cross-dress, having never heard the term 'transvestite', so he called himself a GEM - gender enhanced male.

'I don't dress any differently in Salt Lake City or in Latin America than I do at home,' Goodwin says.

'Just because I go somewhere doesn’t change who I am.'

Dressed up: Cross-dressing remains a taboo even in the most liberal U.S. states

Larry Goodwin prefers to be called Sissy. He took on the name when a woman called him a sissy, appropriating the slur and possessing it.

'First I was offended,' he told the LA Times.

'Then I saw it: "That's who and what I am. I wear women's clothes."'

Sissy Goodwin faced another battle 30 years ago when his place of work tried to have him conform to a male style of dress or face termination of his employment.

'I complied for about three months and then I had a nervous breakdown. I saw a therapist and found out through counseling that I am the way I am and that that’s okay,' he told Gender Public Advocacy Coalition.

Friends and supporters: Goodwin says he's slowly noticed more acceptance among friends and strangers in conservative Wyoming

'About that time the union stepped in and said, “This is a good employee, he’s skilled and experienced.” We went into binding arbitration with the company and when we were done I was allowed to keep my job and my dress.'

Now, Goodwin turns up to his job as an instructor at Casper College's power technology lab.

He tells his mostly male students to call him Sissy and carries his lunch in a pink cooler bag.

He
told the LA Times that he has asked his classes to keep an open mind 
and not judge him on the way he dresses. Once, his class arrived in 
hoodies and removed them in unison to reveal pink ribbons in their hair 
and matching pink shirts to show solidarity to Sissy Goodwin.

In another encouraging gesture, a stranger recently apologized for driving past him and yelling a slur.

Despite
the slow moves forward, Goodwin has no intention of leaving his 
home-state of Wyoming. Once, in 1979, after a particularly terrifying 
experience when he was arrested in a department store for cross 
dressing, he put his house up for sale.

But Goodwin changed his mind: 'When 
someone doesn't meet their expectations of what a man should be like, 
they run him out of town,' he said to the LA Times.

'I wasn't going to go.'

Despite the moniker, it's surely no small act of bravery just for Sissy Goodwin to leave his home every morning dressed in women's clothing.

Leave the house he does, a man in the Cowboy State dressed as a woman and fighting to be allowed to be who he is.

At the state fair this year he felt someone kick him in the behind, and wheeled around to find five cowboys staring him down.

Never one to back down from a fight, he pointed to his blouse: 'See that buddy? Don't let it fool you and don't let it happen again.'

Sissy Goodwin's advice to anyone facing intolerance?

'We are normal, I’d like to tell them. This is normal. Grasp on to all that you are. We are all individuals, and it’s okay to be different. Go out in public. Confide in your family and friends. Don’t hold your head in shame. Crossdressers should be respected just like any other human being. Just be yourself.'
