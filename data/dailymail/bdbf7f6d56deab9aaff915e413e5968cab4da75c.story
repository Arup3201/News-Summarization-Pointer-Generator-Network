Lt. Col. Joseph Miley has been suspended by the Army after an investigation intosexual misconduct

The Army has suspended a top commander for sexual misconduct after a five-month investigation into claims that he had condoned romantic affairs among his troops and promoted a sexy pinup calendar of female soldiers.

Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Miley, commander of the 49th Missile Defense Battalion at Fort Greely, Alaska, will remain on suspension until his case is reviewed by higher-ups who determine what further action is needed, Politico reported.

The Army began investigating Miley in January for his involvement in the pinup calendar, which featured scantily clad women - including his wife and female troops - posing in sexually suggestive ways.Â 

His wife's spread shows her wearing 
only lacy underwear and red heels, while her chest is covered by an old 
vinyl record. The proceeds from the calendar were donated to the 
American Cancer Society.

When investigators dug deeper, they 
found reason to believe that Miley had also been encouraging sexual 
affairs among his troops.

Soldiers at the anti-ballistic 
missile base claimed he had created a 'toxic environment' by turning a 
blind eye to cases of sexual misconduct.

At least 16 women serve at Fort 
Greely, a launch site for anti-ballistic-missile missiles, such as the 
ones the U.S. fears are being developed in Iran and North Korea.

Military officials told NBC News that
by allegedly condoning the behavior Lieutenant Colonel Miley had, in 
effect, created an 'open season' when it came to sexual activity among 
troops.

One official said: 'It's as if that was the only thing to do' at the remote base.

It comes as the Department of Defense
increases its efforts to prevent sexual assault, after reporting this 
month that the number of cases has increased in the past year.

Figures released by the Department of
Defense estimate there were 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact, 
from groping to rape, in 2012. This was a 35 per cent rise in the number
of cases reported in 2010.

Two Army officers assigned to prevent
sexual assault are also currently under investigation for alleged 
attacks, according to CNN.

An Army sergeant first class, who 
worked at Ford Hood's sexual assault prevention unit in Texas, is being 
investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual 
contact and maltreatment of subordinates.

In Arlington, an Air Force officer 
responsible for an assault prevention unit has been charged with sexual 
battery after allegedly fondling a woman in the car park near his 
office.

A Fort Bragg soldier who helps run 
the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program at the North Carolina
base, said sexual assault damaged the strong bonds within the Army.

'This crime of violence, soldier upon soldier, it breaks your trust,' Sgt First Class Josalette R. Simmons, said.

'A lot of victims are young soldiers 
who have left home for the first time and they come in thinking they're 
going to be part of another, bigger family, then this happens. It's 
almost as bad as being sexually assaulted by someone from your own 
family, just breaks that bond of trust,' the 25-year-old who won 
official recognition for her efforts, added.

In an open letter to troops last 
month, Army Chief of Staff General Raymond T. Odierno said the Army was 
failing in its efforts to prevent sexual assault.

He said: 'It is time we take on the fight against sexual assault and sexual harassment as our primary mission.'

Cases of sexual assault and 
harassment were damaging trust within the force, the general said, 
adding: 'These acts violate everything our Army stands for.'
