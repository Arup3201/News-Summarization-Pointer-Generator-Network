Television presenter Mary Berry says she hit her children with kitchen utensils if they were misbehaving

Firm discipline in the house didn't do her children any harm, says Great British Bake Off presenter Mary Berry who has admitted to hitting her children with a wooden butter pat if they misbehaved.

The 78-year-old said she reached for the kitchen utensil if Thomas, Annabel and William were naughty.

Speaking to Piers Morgan during his television series Life Stories, the cook said: 'We had corporal punishment in our house. I don't think it hurts them too much, a quick slap on the legs.

'They would run very fast.'

Despite her rise to fame as a culinary star her husband Paul, who she has been married to for 47 years, critised her food and preferred his mother's cakes to her own. 

According to The Sun on Sunday, the presenter also turned down a visit to see the Queen at Buckingham Palace because she thought it was a 'wind up'. 

'I told them I was doing a cookery demo', she said.

During the interview, which airs later this month on ITV, Mary said she likes to have a spray tan and owns a onesie which has stars on it.

She also remembers going to Ibiza when she was 71 and visiting the club Pacha describing it as a rabbit warren where there were funny coloured drinks.

Earlier this year, Mary said she has ensured the longevity of her marriage by learning to make the dishes her husband's mother used to make.

Proving that the way to a man's heart is through food, Mary revealed she has made his favourite recipes throughout their whole marriage. 

She tied the knot with Paul, now 80 and a retired seller of antique books, in 1966.

However, tragedy struck when their son William died in a car crash aged 19.

William had decided to take the car to go and buy a newspaper with his sister Annabel.

But he went around a corner too fast and was killed. Annabel escaped unhurt.

After the death of her son, Mary began making programmes from home and ran cookery courses.

Her daughter Annabel went on to become a Cordon Bleu certified chef and Thomas, a tree surgeon.

Mary published more than 70 books in nearly half a decade as a cook before appearing in Great British Bake Off. She was awarded a CBE in 2012 for services to culinary arts.

She recently admitted she spoils her husband rotten and revealing how important family is to her, said: 'Having children is the greatest thing that can happen to you as a husband and wife. I was brought up to believe that it's family first.'

Mary, who trained at Le Cordon Bleu school in France and Bath School of Home Economics, revealed one of her popular short cuts: using shop bought pastry.

She has turned the Great British Bake Off into a major success which attracting more than six million viewers.
