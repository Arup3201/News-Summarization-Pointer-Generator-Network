MEPs are preparing to vote on a blanket ban on pornography - which includes censorship of the internet - throughout the EU's 27 member states.

But research scientist and writer Dr Brooke Magnanti – who found fame under her pen name Belle Du Jour – says outlawing erotic entertainment sites and publications will not, as is intended, promote gender equality, and could do more harm than good.

The EU's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality proposed the ban, which is being voted on tomorrow. But, writing in her Telegraph blog, Dr Magnanti says such measures are not only futile, they are also fundamentally 'wrong'.

Arguing that the proposal is based upon the misinformed assumption that all pornography is violent and misogynistic, Dr Magnanti says: 'Porn is not the cause of gender stereotypes; eliminating it will not end them.

'Banning access to porn in Egypt obviously won't do anything to make women more equal to men there. Banning adult entertainment does not eliminate sexual crime, as Iceland surely should know, with its epidemic of sex crimes despite bans on strip clubs and prostitution.

'So why does anyone think such measures would have an effect in the EU?’

Dr Magnanti funded her doctoral studies between 2003 and 2004 working as a London call girl, then published her diaries in the anonymous blog Belle de Jour: Diary of a London Call Girl.

Her blog was dramatised by ITV under the title Secret Diary Of A Call Girl in 2007, with actress Billie Piper playing the title role. Dr Magnanti revealed her true identity in 2009.

MEPs will vote tomorrow on whether there should be a blanket ban on pornography across the 27 member states

In her Telegraph blog Dr Magnanti opines that although the MEP vote will not be a legislative measure, it will pave the way for legislation to come.

She complains that one of the main problems is that the definition of pornography is fuzzy, different to everyone, and as such could potentially, to some people, include topless pro-feminist demonstrations by groups such as the Ukraine's Feme, or raunchy self-portraits texted between partners.

Banning all such electronic communications would be, she says, completely impossible.

Will MEPs vote to ban pornography within the EU?

She continues: ‘But, enough about the logistics of it - this is wrong. As per ever, the focus of the panic is mainstream, heterosexual porn being viewed only by men.

‘Yet again the assumption is that all men are easily programmed, woman-hating abusers, and all women are meek sub-adults who must be protected from the clutches of sexy, sexy evil.

'In this worldview, gay people, mutual consent, and women's sexual agency conveniently do not exist.

'If you think this represents all or even most of pornography then you need to get out more. Where by "out" I mean "the internet".'
