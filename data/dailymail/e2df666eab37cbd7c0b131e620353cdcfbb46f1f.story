Devastated: Colin and Caroline Newman

A devastated husband has hit out after he was charged £2,300 to cancel his wife's holiday of a lifetime - after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer.

Mum-of-two Caroline Newman, 49, was given the bombshell that she had stage-two breast cancer and needed immediate radiotherapy after taking part in an under-50s screening trial.

Ten days earlier, husband Colin, 47, had booked them on a luxury £7,670 holiday in Las Vegas as part of her 50th birthday celebration.

The terrible news meant Colin was forced to call off the trip so Caroline could have surgery and start radiotherapy.

But Virgin Holidays - despite hearing of Caroline's severe illness - charged the couple, of Sherburn-in-Elmet, North Yorkshire, a 30 per cent cancellation fee of around £2,300.

Colin had only booked the holiday ten days before he found out his wife had cancer, after saving up for months in secret.

Colin, a fire consultant, said: 'I 
couldn't believe it when Virgin Holidays said they couldn't do anything 
but charge me 30 per cent. What gets me is their lack of compassion.

'We
have flown with Virgin quite a lot and use them in preference to 
everyone else. We got married in 1998 and went to Florida with Virgin 
for our honeymoon, then a couple of years back we took the whole family 
to Florida again.

'We have been loyal customers for a long time. I asked them to refund the full amount with a view to us rebooking the trip when - hopefully - Caroline has recovered.

'Virgin Holidays said because they really cared they would assist the family in claiming the amount back on our holiday insurance, but they wouldn't be refunding us.'

Splendour: The couple were destined to have the trip of a lifetime at the Vegas hotel

'It was her 50th birthday so I had phoned up her work and arranged time off without her knowing. We have never flown upper class before. We'd always looked at the people in upper class and thought - one day we will be there.

'I'd saved frantically for months and 
Caroline had no idea. She'd always said she didn't want fuss for her 
50th, so this was a complete surprise. She'd always wanted to go to 
Vegas.

Cancelled: Virgin Holidays charged a fee of £2,300 to cancel the luxury break

'But then when I had to break the news, it was a case of 'This is what you could have had, but you have cancer, so we're not going'. It was like that moment on Bullseye when they say 'here's what you could have won'.

Colin originally booked upper class 
seats on a Virgin Atlantic flight from Manchester to Las Vegas on April 
12 - the day before his wife's 50th birthday.

He
had planned to keep it a secret until closer to the time and then 
reveal more surprises - such as a Limousine from the airport to the 
Encore At Wynn resort and their king suite with a panoramic view.

Customer
service officer Caroline said: 'I was so gutted that I wasn't going. It
would have been amazing. Now we are just putting my birthday on hold 
until I hopefully get better. If anyone sends cards in April we are 
going to hold on to them until I get through my treatment and then 
celebrate.'

She said: 'Virgin Holidays does not 
look to profit from the cancellation of holidays and our policies are 
clearly explained in our booking conditions.

'In
the unfortunate instances where a cancellation is unavoidable, we urge 
customers to contact their insurer as they can often reclaim 
cancellation charges from them.'

Caroline's
son Ben, 26, has set up a Facebook group in protest which has already 
attracted 3,500 followers. She also has a 23-year-old daughter, Lydia.
