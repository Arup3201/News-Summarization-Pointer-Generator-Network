There’s one restaurant in Moscow that has a permanent two-for-one deal in place – because it’s staffed purely by twins.

At the Twin Stars diner identical twins – wearing identical clothing - wait the tables and serve the drinks.

Its owner claims that the concept was inspired by a 1964 Soviet film called Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors.

Doubles all round: The staff even wear identical clothing

In the surreal movie a girl called Olya looks in a mirror and sees a twin of herself in an alternate reality. The reflection, called Yalo, has a completely different personality, though.

Alexei Khodorkovsky told the BBC: ‘I like that kind of fairlytale – the imaginative world of twins.’

Twin Stars is certainly a diner with a difference, but it’s not unique.

New York also features a restaurant staffed purely by twins.

Billed as an eaterie with ‘twinergy’, Twins restaurant, run by identical twin sisters Lisa Ganz and Debbie Ganz and actor Tom Berenger, has been open since 1994.

Twins who eat there get two-for-one deals on the drinks, while triplets get three-for-one and quadruplets four-for-one.

‘You see double before you have a cocktail,’ its website says.
