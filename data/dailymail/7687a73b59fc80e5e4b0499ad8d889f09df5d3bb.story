It's a dog's life, but for canines in the Northern Territory things started to look up after a monster crocodile was caught that had been eating dogs in the local area.  

The NT News reported that a 4.38 metre croc that had been eating dogs and threatening locals in a Daly River community was finally caught and removed on Saturday.

The Parks and Wildlife Crocodile Management team trapped the creature near Nauiyu and successfully removed him. Senior ranger Tom Nichols said the animal had been in the area for ‘a couple of weeks’.

‘It was taking dogs from the community and posing a threat to kids in the area,’ he told the NT Times.

‘A trap was set about a week ago and croc was caught on Thursday.’

It took three members of the croc management team and local police to get the half-ton saltie out of the trap.

‘We gave it some drugs, pulled it out of the trap and loaded it up on our skid trailer,’ Mr Nichols said.

‘Some crocs are worse than others but he wasn’t too bad.'

‘We stopped in Adelaide River to wet him down and that gave the local kids, and adults too, a chance to see the croc and ask questions.’ 

This was the 58th crocodile removed from Top End waters this year. It was later taken to the Darwin Crocodile Farm at Noonamah.
