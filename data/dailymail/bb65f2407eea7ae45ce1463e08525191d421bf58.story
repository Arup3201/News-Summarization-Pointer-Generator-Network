It's no secret that American viewers are as fascinated with the latest happenings among the Crawley clan of Downton Abbey as us Brits.

And popular reality-based shows such as Come Dine With Me and Undercover Boss have spawned scores of regional variations across the globe.

But sales of British television shows around the world rose to a staggering £1.22billion last year.

Global popularity: Shows such as Downton Abbey have helped lift sales of UK television shows to £1.22billion

Much loved: The exploits of Lady Mary, Lady Cora and Lady Edith are watched in countries like France, Sweden and in the Middle East as well as in the UK and U.S

New figures from trade association Pact show the US remains the most lucrative market for British shows, with sales increasing by 11 per cent to £475 million in 2012.

Sales to China are up by 90 per cent to £12 million and India by 42 per cent, according to the latest annual Television Exports Survey.

Despite sales to Australasian countries dropping slightly, that market remained the second biggest for UK exports with sales totalling £103million.

Overall sales of UK TV shows around the world were up 4 per cent from £1.178 billion in 2011.

Exports of finished TV programmes - as opposed to formats - dropped slightly but still remained the largest source of television revenue.

Big business: Midsomer Murders is apparently one of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's favourite shows

Pact, which represents independent TV companies, said that dramas and reality-based factual programmes were key to the increase in UK TV exports.

Downton Abbey is one of the UK's most popular exports, now airing in Sweden, Russia, South Korea and various Middle Eastern countries to name a few.

Another popular period drama to spread from UK shores is Parade's End starring benedict Cumberbatch.

Global export: Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, has proved popular abroad

The Wartime show was bought by French broadcaster ARTE before it even aired and 17 other European countries now show it.

Popular crime drama Midsomer Murders is said to be a favourite of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and has been sold to around 225 territories since it first aired on ITV.

But it is not just scripted drama series that have proved a hit elsewhere.

Local versions of shows such as Come Dine With Me are now produced all around the globe, with India the latest territory to produce its own version.

Similarly, Undercover Boss is now broadcast in 200 territories and local variations of the format are shown in 20 countries including the U.S, Canada and France.

But Pact said that the relatively low number of episodes in each season and 'overly domestic content' had prevented some programme sales.

As well as boosting the UK entertainment industry's coffers, the popularity of British shows abroad has also seen the stock of some of our best loved actors and actresses rise across the globe.

Former Doctor Who star David Tennant looks set for stardom in the US with American network Fox set to remake hit crime drama Broadchurch.

According to the Independent, Tennant will put on an American accent for the remake.

John McVay, Chief Executive at Pact, said: 'UK television productions are among the most sought-after in the world. 'International buyers seek out TV from Britain because they are looking for quality and originality. 

'Year after year, our production companies lead the way creatively and our TV business goes from strength to strength.

Popular: Parade's End, also starring Benedict Cumberbatch, is show in at least 17 European countries

'The continued growth in exports to the USA is pleasing and the dramatic increase in sales to China is surely a sign of major developments to come. 

'TV producers in the UK are innovative – they have established the sector among the most successful and influential of the UK's creative industries.'

Paul Dempsey, President Global Markets, BBC Worldwide, added: 'Drama stands out as the most successful British export: shows like Parade's End, Sherlock and Downton Abbey have built a strong reputation for UK drama and made stars of British acting talent.

'Across the world we are seeing strong demand for British content. BBC Worldwide's export sales are up from £275m last year to £296m this year, on a like-for-like basis, and we continue to expect opportunities for growth across multiple territories. 

'One particular example is Asia, where we are seeing strong demand for UK content in countries where we simply haven't experienced it before.'

Remake: UK drama Broadchurch, starring former Doctor Who actor David Tennant, is to be remade for U.S Audiences by Fox
