A seven foot tall basketball player who spent the first 21 years of her life as 'Greg' has set her sights on the USA women’s basketball team for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Olympic hopeful Lindsey Walker, 26, is also hoping to gain the title of the world’s tallest transsexual.

She built her successful basketball career as a man, with a future in the NBA a possibility.

However, the exceptional basketball player from Cleveland, Ohio, believes she was playing the sport to cover her true feelings and decided to quit until recently when she took up the sport again as a woman.

As a male basketball player, she had lots of groupies and lived the life of an all-American frat-boy.

'I did a lot of partying - a lot of frat parties,' explained Lindsey. 'I was so popular I could turn up at a party where I knew no one and everyone would be getting me drinks.'

However, Lindsey believes that her lifestyle was just a way of trying to fit in.

'Basketball was one hell of a cover-up for me,' she said. Not one person had a clue.

'One day I snapped. In the middle of the season, in my third year of college, I quit basketball,' said Lindsey.

'I stopped playing; I stopped training and weight lifting. I've come a long way since then, it feels good.'

Lindsey started seeing a gender therapist and a doctor who prescribed the hormone treatments that have changed her looks and her personality.

'I felt much calmer. Within six weeks I saw my body changing,' said Lindsey.

'I developed breasts in the way a girl would during puberty.

'My body hair decreased. My skin got really soft. I lost the sex drive I had as a man.'

Today Lindsey has long brown hair, B-cup breasts and lives every day as the woman she feels she has always been on the inside.

As a child she would dress in her mother's clothes, but when her parents punished her she decided to hide her feelings - that she was a girl born in a boy's body.

'But I never stopped wanting to play basketball professionally,' said Lindsey.

'I just hated that I was hiding my real self behind basketball and that athlete way of life.

'It became overwhelming for me and I did what I felt I had to do at the time.'

There are some things the hormone injections can't change, however.

Lindsey feels if she had started the transition before puberty, she would not have grown to be seven-feet tall.

She plans on having surgery to feminise her facial bone structure and to change her male genitalia to female genitalia.

'I know there are others like me out there, who are very tall, and because of that they're afraid to come out,' she said.

'It
is harder for them to pass as a woman. I want those girls to see me, 
that I'm seven-foot tall and I'm not afraid to be who I am.

'I feel like the record would convey that message better than my story alone.'
