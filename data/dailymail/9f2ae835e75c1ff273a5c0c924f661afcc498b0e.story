A banned nerve gas has been used to wipe out masses of people 'several times' during the Syrian civil war, the French government confirmed today.

Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the presence of Sarin was detected by researchers in Paris.

France, which is pushing to arm rebels fighting President Bashar Al-Assad's army, said the use of the gas was in breach of all international protocols.

Photographs have already been produced of victims including young children dying from the chemicals.

Sarin is odourless, and so hard to detect, of ten leaving people with no idea that they were have been exposed to the gas.

Within a few minutes, victims experience runny nose, tightness in the chest, and pupil constriction.

Then they have difficulty breathing, 
get sick, and start to drool before they lose control of all their 
bodily functions, begin twitching and ultimately suffocate in a series 
of convulsive spasms.

'It is a horrendous death, and one 
that the international community cannot allow,' said a foreign ministry 
source in the French capital.

Both Assad and the Syrian rebels have 
accused each other of using chemical weapons, but this is the first 
solid evidence  of 'localised use' said Mr Fabius.

March as the bloodiest month of the 
conflict so far, with more than 6,000 people killed, including more than
 500 women and children.

Some 70,000 people are thought to have
 died since the uprising began in March 2011 as part of the Arab Spring 
revolution across the Middle East and North Africa. Hundreds of 
thousands more have been wounded, imprisoned and made homeless.

Sarin was first developed in Nazi Germany in 1938 by two scientists who were trying to create a stronger pesticide.

When its potential for chemical 
warfare was realised during the Second World War, the Germans started 
mass-producing it, but it was never used.

NATO listed Sarin as a standard 
chemical weapon in the 1950s, but it was not used properly until 1988 
when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein used it to wipe out some 5000 people 
in the Kurdish city of Haljaba, in northern Iraq.

They all died over the course of two days when some 20 aircraft dropped the chemicals on the town.

Sarin gas was also said to have been 
used during the Gulf War in 2004, with the west using it as evidence of 
the banned weapons of mass destruction the American and British 
governments claimed Iraq possessed.

Mr Fabius said: 'These tests show the 
presence of sarin in various samples in our possession. France is 
certain that sarin gas was used several times in Syria in limited 
areas.'

Mr Fabius said that the test results 
had been handed to the United Nations because chemical weapons are 
banned by international law.

Concerns: The report to the Human Rights Council on violations in Syria's conflict accused both sides of committing war crimes during the conflict

It came as a UN report stated that 
there were 'reasonable grounds' to suggest that chemical weapons were 
being used in Syria. Mr Fabius would not state whether the Sarin had 
been used by the Syrian Army, or by the rebels.

The disclose comes after a U.N. report said today that there
 are 'reasonable grounds' to believe that toxic chemicals have been used
 as weapons in at least four attacks in Syria's civil war.

The U.N. Commission of Inquiry said more evidence is needed to determine the precise chemical agents used or who used them and called on Damascus to allow a team of experts into the country.

The report said there are allegations of
 government forces using chemical weapons in four instances, but also 
did not rule out rebels using them.

The commission's report to the Human 
Rights Council on violations in Syria's conflict also accused both sides of 
committing war crimes.

In an apparent message to European 
countries considering arming Syrian rebels, the report warned that the 
transfer of arms would heighten the risk of violations, leading to more 
civilian deaths and injuries.

'War crimes and crimes against 
humanity have become a daily reality in Syria where the harrowing 
accounts of victims have seared themselves on our conscience,' the 
report said. 'There is a human cost to the increased availability of 
weapons,' it added.

U.N.-Secretary
 General Ban Ki-moon has appointed a U.N. team to investigate alleged 
chemical weapons attacks in Syria after the Syrian government asked him 
to investigate a purported attack by rebels on March 19 on Khan al-Assal
 village in the northern city of Aleppo. But the Syrian government 
insists that a probe be limited to that incident.

Syrian soldiers were reportedly killed 
and injured in the incident, which the rebels blame on Syrian forces. 
Opposition activists have claimed more than six instances when regime 
forces used chemical weapons.

Ban is insisting on a broader 
investigation, including a December incident in Homs. He appointed 
Swedish chemical weapons expert Ake Sellstrom to lead a U.N. 
investigation. Syria has refused to allow his team into the country.

The confirmed use of chemical weapons
 could escalate the international response to the more than two-year-old
 conflict, which has killed more than 70,000 people, according to the 
United Nations. President Barack Obama has said their use would be a 
'red line,' but the administration says it still looking for solid 
evidence. 

'There are 
reasonable grounds to believe that chemical agents have been used as 
weapons,' the report said. 'It has not been possible, on the evidence 
available, to determine the precise chemical agents used, their delivery
 systems or the perpetrator.'

'It is possible that anti-government armed groups may access and use chemical weapons.... though there is no compelling evidence that these groups possess such weapons or their requisite delivery systems,' the report said.

'Conclusive findings - particularly in the absence of a large-scale attack - may be reached only after testing samples taken directly from victims or the site of the alleged attack,' it said. 

The report, covering the period from mid-January to mid-May, accused both sides of committing war crimes. On the government side, the report accused government forces and affiliated militia of committing torture, rape, forcible displacement and enforced disappearance.

On the rebel side, the report accused armed groups of carrying out sentencing and execution without due process, as well as committing torture, taking hostages and pillaging.

But it said violations and abuses by the rebels 'did not, however, reach the intensity and scale of those committed by government forces and affiliated militia.'

'A dangerous state of fragmentation and disintegration of authority prevails in areas under anti-government armed groups control, despite attempts to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawal of the state through creating local councils,' it said.
