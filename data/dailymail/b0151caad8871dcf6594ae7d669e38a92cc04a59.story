This cool kid shows goats can ride motorbikes too.

And, just to be on the safe side, the farm animal is wearing a helmet.

The bizarre clip showing two men and a goat going for a ride is believed to have been taken on a street in the city of Qazvin, in north-western Iran.

What's that? A driver sees a bike with two unusual passengers on the road in front

As the motorbike approaches you can see that not only does it have two men on board, it also has two goats

A motorbike is seen out of the window of a car coming up behind it.

As the car passes the animal is clearly seen being carried on the back by two men, who are believed to be farmers.

And one of them, while hanging on tight, gives a wave.

The clip was posted on video sharing site LiveLeak yesterday and already had more than 13,000 views.
