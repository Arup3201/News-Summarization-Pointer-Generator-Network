Ukip has taken a commanding 13-point lead in the crunch Rochester by-election, according to a shock poll last night.

The ComRes survey suggests former Tory MP Mark Reckless is on course to win next month’s by-election in Kent, just weeks after defecting to Ukip.

The survey of 1,500 voters puts Ukip on 43 per cent, well ahead of the Conservatives on 30 per cent.

Labour, which came second in the seat in 2010, is trailing on 21 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats and Greens both languishing on 3 per cent.

The poll suggests Ukip is consolidating its grip on the seat, despite a massive push by the Tories. The last opinion poll in the constituency, on October 5, put the Conservatives nine points behind.

The development is a serious setback to David Cameron, who has pledged to ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at the attempt to hold the seat, in a bid to halt the Ukip surge.

Ominously for the Prime Minister, the latest poll found that 62 per cent of voters view the November 20 by-election as a ‘good opportunity to show David Cameron and the Conservatives how unhappy I am with their Government’.

The Prime Minister was rocked earlier this month by the Clacton by-election, where Tory defector Douglas Carswell crushed his former party to become Ukip’s first elected MP.

A second defeat by Ukip would be a body blow to Mr Cameron just six months away from the General Election.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is predicting that more MPs will defect to the anti-EU party if Mr Reckless wins, sparking further debilitating by-elections.

Some Tories have even warned that defeat could lead to a challenge against Mr Cameron’s leadership.

Unlike in Clacton, Tory sources were initially confident that they could win in Rochester, arguing that Mr Reckless is a less popular figure locally than Mr Carswell and that Ukip has less of a presence.

At the 2010 election Mr Reckless took Rochester and Strood for the Conservatives with a majority of almost 10,000 over Labour. Ukip did not stand in the seat last time.

The latest poll suggests that Ukip is drawing its support from across the political spectrum. Some 39 per cent of people who voted Conservative in 2010 now plan to vote Ukip, as do 39 per cent of Lib Dems and 30 per cent of Labour voters.

More than half of people who did not vote in 2010 (57 per cent) say they plan to vote Ukip. The party’s success or failure may hinge on its ability to persuade this group to turn out and vote.

Tory sources acknowledge they have ‘carpet-bombed’ the constituency with leaflets since Mr Reckless quit last month.

This has included a personal letter from Mr Cameron to every home in the constituency inviting voters to take part in an ‘open primary’ election to select the Tory candidate.

The winner of the contest between local councillors Kelly Tolhurst and Anna Firth is due to be announced today.

Tory MPs have each been ordered to campaign in the constituency at least five times before polling day. But the latest poll suggests many voters are already suffering from overkill.

Two-thirds (66 per cent) said the Conservatives were ‘coming across as desperate’ by focusing so many resources on the campaign.

There is some solace for Mr Cameron, as the poll suggests he is seen slightly more favourably than Mr Farage.

But other key Tory messages appear to be struggling to gain traction. Some 53 per cent of voters believe Mr Reckless has acted in a ‘principled’ way, compared to 37 per cent who do not.

Fewer than half of voters (47 per cent) believe Mr Cameron will keep his pledge to hold an In/Out referendum on Europe in 2017 if he wins a second term next year.

And just 38 per cent say they are concerned that a vote for Ukip next year might usher Ed Miliband into Downing Street, compared with 54 per cent who are not.
