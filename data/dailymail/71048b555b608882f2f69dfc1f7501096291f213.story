Seven clubs are to make offers for Barcelona right back Dani Alves this summer.

Manchester United and Liverpool are among the clubs reported to be interested in signing the Brazil international, along with Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan and his current employers Barca.

Spanish newspaper Sport claim Louis van Gaal will not only offer Alves large wages, the Old Trafford manager is prepared to offer him a bonus for signing as a free agent.

The 31-year-old's contract expires at the Nou Camp in June 2015, and it seems Alves has his pick of the Barclays Premier League, Serie A, Ligue 1 or La Liga before he retires.

Alves showed he can still perform at the top level against Manchester City in the Champions League and Real Madrid in La Liga - both of which were televised.

Alves joined Barca in 2008 from Sevilla for £23million, rising to £30m, and has made 208 appearances in La Liga for the Catalan giants. His initial contract had a buyout clause of £66m.
