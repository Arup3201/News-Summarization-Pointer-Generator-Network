When you see Faith and Hope Findlay, you could be forgiven for thinking there is a big age gap between the two sisters.

Six-year-old Hope, after all, towers over her sibling.

But Faith is actually a year older than Hope. Sadly, she suffers from a form of dwarfism, that is so rare there are just 30 cases in the world.

It means strangers always think Faith is the youngest sister.

She only weighs the same as an 18-month-old toddler and her school uniform is for a child aged three.

Mrs Findlay, 40, a nanny, said: ‘Her condition was so rare it took doctors years to find out what was wrong with her.

‘She
may be tiny but she has such a big heart. And she loves being small. 
She tells me that she doesn’t want to be bigger. All good things come in
small packages - and that's what Faith is.’

When Faith was born, she was a normal weight for an average baby, 
weighing 8Ib 1oz, and she was the heaviest of the couple’s three children.

Her older sister Grace, now nine, weighed in at a smaller 5Ib 6oz, and her younger sister Hope weighed 6Ib13oz when she was born.

But by the age of three months Faith was constantly being sick and had recurrent coughs and chest infections.

Mrs Findlay, who lives with husband 
Flint, 41, a civil servant, in Newcastle, said: ‘We never thought there 
was anything wrong with Faith when she was born - she seemed just 
perfect.

But then when
she was just a few months old, she started being poorly all the time. 
She just seemed to pick up infections one after the other.’

When Faith was 11 months old, she 
suddenly started gasping for breath and the couple rushed her into 
hospital.

She was placed on a ventilator and doctors discovered that her
lungs were full of fluid.

Tests showed that she had an abnormal heart 
valve that was leaking directly into her lungs.

Mrs Findlay said: ‘She looked so frail lying there and we didn’t know what was wrong. She still weighed only 11Ibs, and she’d had her first birthday.

We couldn’t understand why she was only so tiny. The doctors thought at first that the leaking valve had caused problems with her digestive system which had restricted her growth.’

Faith then underwent a nine-hour 
operation to replace her faulty heart valve with a mechanical one. The 
operation was a success, but as the months went by she still didn’t 
grow.

Mrs Findlay said:
‘People used to think she was so cute because she was so tiny, but by 
her second birthday, she was still no bigger than she had been at her 
first birthday.

'She seemed too little. When her sister Hope reached her 
first birthday, she was the same size as Faith. People used to think 
they were twins.’

Faith was referred to a genetics centre 
in Newcastle who found that she was producing growth hormones normally. 
All the tests for growth conditions were negative.

When she started school at the age of 
four, the school had to fit extra steps in the classroom and she had a 
booster seat to be able to sit down for mealtimes.

Then doctors finally discovered an answer. Tests showed that Faith had a
condition called Geleophysic Dysplasia, an incredibly rare form of 
dwarfism.

It is caused by inherited genetic 
mutations which result in very short stature and abnormalities to the 
bones, joints, heart and skin. Unlike many forms of dwarfism is doesn’t 
cause shortened limbs - just a miniature frame.
It can also cause abnormalities to the heart and an enlarged liver. It 
is often life-threatening, but sufferers can live in to adulthood.

Mrs Findlay said: ‘We were absolutely
devastated when Faith was diagnosed. We had never even heard of this 
condition before. The chances of her having it were a staggering 200 
million to one.

‘She had just been incredibly unlucky.’

Judith Findlay, pictured here with her husband Flint, said that they were both devastated when Faith was diagnosed with the rare form of dwarfism and they had never heard of the condition before

The couple’s other two children were tested for the condition and been given the all-clear, but there is no cure for Faith, who has been the subject of a medical journal in Newcastle.

She has had another two heart operations and her chest cavity is now struggling to hold her growing organs.

Mrs Findlay said: ‘She has been in hospital recently because she was struggling to breathe. Her organs are getting squashed in her chest, so we don’t know what the future holds for her.

‘But she is just taking one day at a time. She may be tiny, but she has the heart of a lion. She’s so fearless and feisty - if she thinks her younger sister is being picked on, she’ll stand up to anyone.

'She’s full of fun and says she wants to be a princess when she grows up. She’s an absolute mini marvel and a real inspiration.’
