A crisis in the eurozone, crucial talks on Afghanistan and a faltering economy could make it hard for David Cameron to relax at home.

But according to a new book, the Prime Minister does not find it difficult to switch off from the pressures of leading the country - karaoke, snooker, tennis against a machine dubbed 'the Clegger' and three or four glasses of wine at Sunday lunch, are just a few of the ways Mr Cameron spends his downtime.

In the biography of the Prime Minister and his life at his country retreat Chequers, an ally is quoted  admitting: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for ‘chillaxing’, he would win it.'

The Prime Minister’s leisure habits have been seen by some as a sign of a lack of application.

Some Tory MPs say he should spend more time sorting out the run of problems which have plagued the Government in recent months as opinion polls continue falling.

Mr Cameron has been dubbed 'DVD Dave' with recent photographs taken inside his Downing Street flat showing the couple had 24, Desperate ­Housewives and Band of Brothers in their box set collection.

He was also mocked this week for being pictured enjoying a swanky meal with his wife Samantha on one of their weekly 'date nights.'

The book reveals that one the first Christmas since he moved into Downing Street, Mr Cameron's friends gave him a karaoke machine which is now at the house and he invites friends over for game of snooker.

There is a machine that fires tennis balls, which he has nicknamed 'the Clegger' after his victorious battle against the Deputy Prime Minister in the 2010 General Elections.

The book, Cameron: Practically a Conservative, serialised in The Times tells how Mr Cameron flicks through the papers early on a Sunday morning and spends his time at his computer.

His afternoon consists of 'a crap film on telly, play with the children, cook, have three or four glasses of wine with lunch, have an afternoon nap, play tennis, according to a friend quoted in the newspaper.

Slicing through it: Critics claim Mr Cameron seems more bothered about slicing fruit in the platform game Fruit Ninja than dealing with Britain's increasing economic problems

Michael Gove, the Education Secretary and a family friend, told the authors: 'He is the model of how to have a clear divide between the world of work and then relaxation so you can clear your mind. There are very few people who have such a finely developed capacity to do that.'

The book also reveals Mr Cameron can often be found surfing political betting websites.

It also discloses his intense dislike of people clicking pens and checking phones during meetings and how his friend of 20 years and policy guru Steve Hilton believes that Mr Cameron had become too power hungry and has compromised his early ambitions for the demands of the coalition and Whitehall.

Mr Cameron's aides have stated the idea of Mr Cameron spending a disproportionate amount of time relaxing are grossly unfair.

But yesterday, Mr Cameron was forced into frantic denials over bizarre claims that he spends a ‘crazy and scary’ amount of time playing computer games on his iPad.

The Prime Minister, a fan of Apple’s trendy tablet computer, is said to be obsessed with the cult game Fruit Ninja, in which players swipe their fingers across a screen to slice through moving images of pieces of melon, orange and pineapple.

Date night Dave: Mr Cameron was mocked this week for being pictured enjoying a swanky meal with his wife Samantha on one of their weekly 'date nights'

Despite the economic crisis – not to mention the demands of raising three young children – Mr Cameron is said to spend hours tinkering with his iPad and playing computer games.

Yesterday Fraser Nelson, editor of the respected and pro-Conservative Spectator magazine, suggested that what was harmless fun had become an obsession.

He said a senior adviser to Mr Cameron had told him the Prime Minister spends ‘a crazy, scary amount of time playing Fruit Ninja on his iPad’.

Mr Nelson suggested the Prime Minister should ‘turn off the iPad and start dealing with our debt’. Downing Street last night flatly denied the claim, saying it was one of Mr Cameron’s children – aged eight, six and 21 months – who played the game.

A source said: ‘It is absolutely not true that the Prime Minister plays Fruit Ninja.’

But Mr Cameron has himself admitted to dabbling with the game, saying it helps him cope with the everyday stress of life in Downing Street.

Indeed, he told an interviewer earlier this year: ‘It’s quite good, to get your frustration out. If you can’t have a reshuffle, play Fruit Ninja.’

The Prime Minister has also said that computer games can help him relax during long journeys.

What's he up to? Pictured at his home, is Cameron checking up with government work, or playing games aimed at a younger audience?

Last night former Labour minister John Spellar said it was astonishing that Mr Cameron could find time to play computer games at all, given the scale of the problems facing Britain.

The MP said: ‘Anyone who has ever been a minister knows that the pressures on your time are intense – and that is only a fraction of the time pressure faced by a prime minister.

‘It is a round-the-clock job and I think it is frankly extraordinary that he is wasting time on computer games when Britain is in the throes of an international economic crisis.

‘Instead of trying to show that he is down with the kids he should be getting on with the job.’

Mr Cameron is thought to have taken up Fruit Ninja after completing the hit game Angry Birds. In a separate interview earlier this year the Prime Minister admitted that he found Angry Birds ‘addictive’, but denied it was taking up too much of his time.

He said: ‘It is quite addictive, but I want to reassure you I don’t spend a huge amount of time on it.

‘Sometimes on these long flights, when you have done all your  work, you have had all your conversations and prepared all your speeches, you need something to relax with.

‘Sometimes I watch a bit of television, sometimes I play a bit of Angry Birds.’

Mr Cameron is also known to have become increasingly reliant on his iPad.

He has ordered civil servants to create an application for the device to keep him informed of breaking news and the performance of government departments and ministers.

The £20,000 app will also produce data on polling, unemployment figures, NHS waiting lists and movements in the markets.

It will also give ‘real time’ feeds from Twitter and news websites so the Prime Minister can keep up to date with events in the UK and around the world.
