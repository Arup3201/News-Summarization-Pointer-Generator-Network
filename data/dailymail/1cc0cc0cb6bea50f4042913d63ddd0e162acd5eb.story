In Michel Platini’s perfect world football would be a non-contact sport.

The Beautiful Game, as described by Pele, would be a work of art un-desecrated by physical collision.

Supremely gifted players – like himself in his glory years with France – would be free to paint their masterpieces on the canvas of the pitch without fear of pain or injury.

Possession would be gained by perfectly-timed nudging away of the ball from the feet of a rival, by interception, or by passing error or mis-control by the opponent. Thus defending would become a fine art in itself.

All the energy poured into thunderous tackles and aerial combat wold be channelled into pace, power-running and kaleidoscopic movement on and off the ball.

The UEFA president has long-envisioned the purity of such contests of supreme skills, high intelligence and creative imagination.

That idealistic concept lies at the heart of Platini’s unease with the robust, headlong, get stuck in, up-and-at-‘em football which is the commercial driving force of the Premier League.

This makes for super-charged thrills for mass audiences, if not for the greatest league in the world which it fancies itself to be.

Platini cherishes excellence above excitement and every four years since 1966 the World Cup has come around to help him remind England that the game’s supreme prize goes to the craftsmen, not the crash-bang-wallopers.

Now he is seeking legislation to tip the balance in favour of talent over intimidation.

Platini’s latest wheeze – for which he has the support of legendary referee Pierluigi Collina – is to punish players who inflict physical damage by keeping them off the pitch for as long as their victims need treatment.

Collina, now Platini’s head of refereeing, said this week: ‘It is not fair for teams to gain a temporary one-player advantage by injuring an opponent.’

Now, in that perfect world of Platini’s there would appear to be some merit in the proposal.

But in the real football world, which sadly is inhabited by at least as many cunning cheats as true sportsmen, it is not only riddled with complication but fraught with the possibility for exploitation.

What better way to nullify a genius like Lionel Messi than for a lesser opponent to feign injury after a first-minute challenge with him and then keep both of them off the pitch for the remaining 89 minutes?

As it is referees have the devil’s own job discerning whether a player has dived or been fouled. Now they would have to decide not only if someone has been deliberately hacked down but if he really is badly hurt.

And where would it end? If Messi‘s supposed victim was to be out for months, would Barcelona’s maestro continue to be sidelined until such time as that man recovered?

As with so many of Platini’s ideas, this one is well intentioned but impractical to the point of naivety.

With this man it seems you have to take the bad with good, the sensible with the eccentric.

Platini is also coming round to favouring the idea of sin-bins, as employed in rugby for example.

The rationale here is that it is better for such 10 or 15-minute expulsions to benefit the opposing team during the game in question, rather than to impose cautions which remove the culprits from future matches.

Now this one makes better sense, since it would discourage not only the choppers but also the divers.

But since Platini’s long game would appear to be to eliminate the honest tackle, that would take such qualities as courage and commitment out of a game which is supposed to be played by heroes.

If that were to happen Monsieur UEFA’s Utopia would become a bland, sanitised, aesthetic but eventually unexciting place to be.

For more years than some of us care to remember this has been one of football’s cardinal maxims:  You win nothing with kids.

In truth that should have been amended long ago to something like this:  You win nothing without kids but they need some shrewd older heads to guide them.

Thus the real sanity of Roy Hodgson’s selection is not that it is the youngest England squad for more than half a century but that it contains that crucial mix of youth and experience.

There have been mutterings among the most zealous reformers about the inclusion, for example, of 35-year-old Frank Lampard in the party bound for Brazil.

Rolls Royce: Frank Lampard's experience will be invaluable to England in Brazil

But while Michael Carrick comes from the in-between years which separate Lampard and Steven Gerrard from such youngsters as Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, would he really have bridged the generation gap to better effect?

While Carrick and has been unable to bale out that floundering Titanic called Manchester United, Lampard has helped keep Chelsea afloat.

Not only is he the most prolific midfield goalscorer of the era but his engine continues to run as smoothly and tirelessly as ever.

If Barkley promises to be England’s Ferrari against Italy, then Lampard is Hodgson’s Rolls Royce.

Gerrard has been a similar driving force behind Liverpool’s resurgence. But unlike the England captain, Lampard has not yet had to modify his game to that of the creative anchor man in midfield.

He can still lead the charge, as well as by example.

If England are to prosper in Brazil, the teenagers and 20-year-olds to whom Hodgson has turned to invigorate the stagnate pool of South Africa 2010 will need that experience to help them focus their energetic assaults on the best defences on the planet.

World Cups are never all about flat-out attack.

Often, these finals are played in draining heat and humidity. Always, they are refereed to standards far stricter than those applied in the Premier League.

There are elements of building for Russia 2018 in Hodgson’s choice. But if a more promising future is not to be undermined by a crushing retreat from Rio, then the wisdom of the ages must play its part at Brazil 2014.

Luis Suarez has been presented with the most historic and prestigious individual honour in the English game.

In years gone by the diving, biting antics which almost forced his deportation from the Premier League would have precluded his election as Footballer of the Year by we members of the Football Writers’ Association – his marvellous goalscoring talent notwithstanding.

Times have changed and standards altered.

Times are a changing: Luis Suarez has been named FWA player of the year despite his dubious past

True legend: Sir Tom Finney was a superb footballer and a gentleman off the pitch

Striking example: Nat Lofthouse (with trophy) is another great of the English game

Iconic: Bobby Moore was the best English defender of all time and a former FWA winner

To be fair to the Uruguayan who will threaten England’s progress in Brazil, Suarez has been making a conscious effort to reform himself at Liverpool of late.

Eventually history will judge him by how he wears the crown which has just been placed upon his head in London.

Hopefully, when he surveys such names as Sir Tom Finney, Sir Stanley Matthews, Sir Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore, Nat Lofthouse, Joe Mercer, Billy Wright, Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and, close to home, Steven Gerrard among the galaxy of previous winners, the message that behaviour matters as much as brilliance will be driven home to Suarez.

Permanently.
