Roberto Martinez is unsure whether Everton will be able to prise Romelu Lukaku away from parent club Chelsea.

The giant striker has enjoyed an excellent campaign on loan at Goodison Park this season and scored 15 goals to fire the Blues to fifth in the Barclays Premier League table.

However, Martinez insists the Toffees must wait to see what Chelsea's intentions are with regards to the striker before trying to strike a deal to sign Lukaku permanently.

believes Stones is ready to perform on the international stage and said:
 'I trust and admire the England manager. If he decides that youngsters 
be called up, I can guarantee they are ready. He has faced any type of 
situation, different strikers. He is ready to embrace any challenge that
 comes his way.

'We
 will support the England manager's decision. The young players have had
 a huge role and they have performed. The character and maturity they 
have in their personalities means they are ready.

'Ross
 Barkley and John Stones have been playing beyond their years. We are 
here to try and help the national team. Whatever Roy Hodgson decides, we
 will try to help him as best we can.
