Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

RICKIE LAMBERT GOT ME THE SACK

I'm so pleased for Rickie Lambert, getting a dream move to his hometown club Liverpool.

What a remarkable story going from the lower leagues to playing in a World Cup and the Champions League aged 32.

Dream come true: England striker Rickie Lambert is set to join hometown club Liverpool from Southampton

I remember all-too well how deadly he can be as a striker.

He put a nail in my coffin as manager of Cheltenham Town back in 2009 when he grabbed a winner playing for Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Ground on a Tuesday night.

Lambert had already scored once and, with the score tied at 2-2 and the game going into the final five minutes, I thought we were set for a point.

But suddenly, out of nowhere, he smashed in a half-volley from around the penalty spot and won them the game.

Soon after that, I watched him play for Rovers at Wycombe Wanderers and he integrated into midfield and linked up play in a similar style to what is required by Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool.

He played wide, he played deep, and he played on the shoulder.

Over the years I've seen him play at all levels and he is more than just an old-fashioned, six foot two, Bob Latchford-style centre forward.

With Liverpool in the Champions League they will need a lot more players to cope with the games, the injuries, suspensions and general fatigue, especially in the season following a World Cup.

It will be a big test for Brendan and at only £4million I think he has got a bargain.

All smiles: Rickie Lambert celebrates scoring for Bristol Rovers - a goal which saw Martin Allen sacked as Cheltenham manager back in 2009

ROY NEEDS TO DITCH ROONEY

Forget the reputation. Forget the history. The decision on Wayne Rooney has to be made on current form.

People are wondering how to fit Raheem Sterling into the England team. There's no question, he needs to be playing ahead of Rooney.

He should be one of the first names on the team sheet playing behind Daniel Sturridge, just as he's done so well for Liverpool.

The boy is not a winger. His game has changed and for Liverpool he has been quite outstanding playing in that No 10 role with his speed, quality in the final third, willingness to track back and help defensively.

Forget reputation: Wayne Rooney needs to be ditched for Raheem Sterling based on current form

He can retain possession and keep the ball moving with one and two touch play and, for me, we should start with him against the Italians who lack pace and speed at the back.

Wayne has been a magnificent player but, like Fernando Torres, he started at such a young age and it looks to me as though his best days are now behind him.

The pace has gone and the fuel-injection system he had in his engine is now a steady four-door family saloon.

Start Sterling and anything can happen.

GOOD RIDDANCE, BRUTAL DAVID LUIZ

To get £50m for David Luiz - a centre half who is a liability, trying back-heels and flicks, running out of position, charging around everywhere - is nuts.

Last year, I watched a Chelsea versus Brentford FA Cup match and with Chelsea winning 4-0 there was a 50-50 on the half-way line between Luiz and a young 19-year-old called Jake Reeves who had just come on as a substitute.

It was a 50-50 with the ball five yards away and both running at full speed.

Good riddance: Martin Allen is glad to see David Luiz departing Chelsea after witnessing the Brazilian's challenge on young Brentford player Jake Reeves last year

It was the last minute of this London derby. The game was already over. Chelsea had won it.

What did Luiz do? He lifted his elbow and smashed the young whippersnapper straight across his forehead and sparked him out, in a similar fashion to the way Carl Froch took down George Groves on Saturday, on the Stamford Bridge canvas. Incredibly the referee let him get away with it while Reeves was unconscious on the floor.

That day I was doing commentary for ITV and the Mad Dog mist descended one again.

I so badly wished I would have had the chance just to play one more time with him in the opposition team.

GOING COMMANDO

My bags are packed with old kit and boots, my toothbrush and one set of training kit, for a week's visit to Burkino Faso in west Africa where I will be taking a coaches training programme for the charity 'Coaching for Hope.'

I'm taking no clothes apart from the ones I'm travelling in. Instead my bag is filled with colouring pens, colouring books, balloons, old football kit and old trainers for when I visit the orphanages in one of the poorest countries in the world. There is not even any room for my underpants.

In this Mad world of football management it helps me appreciate just how lucky we all are when you meet these people with big smiles on their faces, enjoying life.

In the mornings, at half-past seven, the children walk miles to school. There are no big four-by-fours or cars running the kids about.

Talent: Young Burkina Faso player Bertrand Traore signed a four-year contract with Chelsea in January

At half-one in the afternoon, in the boiling sun, they calmly walk back and then from three o'clock onwards, on every spare patch of land, you see kids, children and youths playing football everywhere. And I mean, everywhere.

It's no wonder Burkino Faso won the 2011 African Under 17 Championship and that Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United have set up academies to attract the best young players.

When I was over there before, I once met a 15-year-old lad who was built like Mike Tyson, could run like Steve Ovett and was a machine in central midfield.

It is no wonder in January the player, Bertrand Traore, now 18, signed a four-year professional contract with Chelsea.

These boys are so fit, so strong. They are hungry and technically, after playing on orangey-grey shale for so many years, they are top drawer.

They play football seven days a week, they have no laptops, iPads, and very few TVs.I cannot wait to see those lovely smiles once again.

My week...

Last Monday I went to see Fleetwood Town win promotion in the League Two play-off final against Burton Albion.

I was fortunate enough to get tickets sat right behind the dugouts as a guest of the Football League.

Instead of taking advantage of the hospitality, I was there five yards behind the dugout eating a hot dog as long as my arm filled with onions and tomato sauce.

I'm not sure the prawn sandwich brigade and the substitutes sat on the bench appreciated the waft as I sat there munching away.

At the end of the game both the ecstasy and the agony were just 10 yards away on either side. To my left it was the wives and families of the Fleetwood players taking photos, hugging, singing and dancing.

They new there would be new deals offered, bonuses triggered and bigger contracts.

But just 10 yards to my right, the Burton family and friends sat there dejected, proud of their partners and sons but overwhelmed, several with tears streaming down their cheeks.

The players were probably wondering whether they were going to have new deals for next season.

The great rise: Fleetwood have been promoted for the sixth time in nine years

Down in front of me Graham Alexander was hugged by everybody as he proudly squeezed every player and member of staff with smiles from ear-to-ear.

I looked across to the Burton bench and it was handshakes and pats on the back all round. Their manager Gary Rowett has done a fantastic job on a small budget and he is definitely a manager to look out for.

He stood there quietly and calmly, taking the defeat diplomatically and in the right spirit.

I imagine he was probably trying to work out already which players he would be letting go on free transfers to freshen up his squad, ready for the challenge he faces next season.

This is the reality of lower-level football where most players now get one-year deals and it is make or break.

Fleetwood's players are now probably off on two-week holidays, with plenty of sunshine, knowing their future is firmly secured. The Burton players will be ringing their agents hoping to get a club.

It's a Mad world in football.
