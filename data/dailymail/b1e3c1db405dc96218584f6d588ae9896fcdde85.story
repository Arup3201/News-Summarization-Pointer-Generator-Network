France winger Noa Nakaitaci was inches away from committing the ultimate rugby gaffe during Saturday's crunch clash against England.

The 24-year-old, playing just his second international for Les Bleus, ran in to score in the 17th minute at Twickenham.

But as Nakaitaci attempted to get nearer the posts he was pushed by Ben Youngs and appeared to step over the dead ball line before grounding the ball.

The try was awarded by the Television Match Official (TMO) Jim Yuille

Welsh referee Nigel Owens referred the decision to the Television Match Official (TMO), Jim Yuille from Scotland.

TV replays suggested Nakaitaci had just grounded the ball before his left foot stepped over the dead ball line but he may have lost control of the ball.

After studying all the camera angles, Yuille awarded the try to put France 15-7 ahead and give England a mountain to climb in their pursuit of the Six Nations title.

Sportsmail columnist and England World Cup winning coach Sir Clive Woodward, appearing as a pundit for the BBC, said it was the right decision.

'We always say we want the ball behind the posts but that was taking it to extremes. That was a magic moment really.' he said.

It proved to be a crucial decision. Despite England beating France 55-35, Ireland retained the Six Nations title by scoring six more points.
