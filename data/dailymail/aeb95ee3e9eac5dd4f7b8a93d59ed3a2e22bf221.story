A university drop-out posed as a surrogate mother and robbed a childless couple of their savings in a ‘cruel and hurtful’ fraud, a court heard yesterday.

Samantha Cookes, 23, preyed on the couple’s vulnerability after they had suffered the heartache of miscarriages  and three failed IVF cycles by falsely promising to help them start a family.

But instead she disappeared with their money, leaving the husband and wife deeply traumatised.

Samantha Cookes preyed on the couple's vulnerability after they had suffered the heartache of miscarriages and three failed IVF cycles

She told them she was a court-approved social worker and claimed to have been a surrogate mother for a wealthy family who were prepared to vouch for her, the hearing was told.

Cookes, a former York University student, then created a Facebook account in the name of the fictitious woman and exchanged messages with the couple about the ‘wonderful’ experience.

By the time the couple realised they had been duped, they had paid Cookes £1,200 for ‘contracts, legal fees and insemination kits’, and had already started planning for their longed-for family.

Despite her cruel deception, Cookes was yesterday spared jail after the court heard that she had suffered undiagnosed psychiatric problems since losing her four-month-old daughter to cot death in 2008.

Last night her devastated victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ‘We are annoyed she did not get a harsher punishment – it’s just a slap on the wrist after all the hurt she has caused. She’s put us through hell. We cannot believe that anyone can be so callous.’

Cookes began the deception in February last year after contacting the couple through an internet forum for surrogacy.

The couple, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, told her about their failed IVF attempts, the miscarriages and their desire to adopt or foster. They were desperate to start a family and saw surrogacy as a last resort.

Cookes told them she had been a surrogate already, for a family from the West Midlands, who would be happy to provide them with references vouching for her.

She then created the fake Facebook account, using the name Claudia Bronwyn. In one message to the couple she wrote: ‘I’m extremely grateful to Samantha – she has an incredible heart. She has given us a wonderful gift.’

Cookes also gave them fake documents showing she had been a surrogate and even urged them to decide quickly because she had others on a waiting list.

She then demanded payment  for expenses – including travelling to see the couple at their home – and for her solicitor to draw up  the contract.

The couple used all their savings as well as money from the wife’s business as they chased their dream of becoming parents. But after handing over the cash, they grew suspicious, Teesside Crown Court was told.

Cookes began avoiding telephone calls and text messages and persuaded them not to travel to her house. She claimed the hold-ups were due to ‘tiny’ problems with the contract.

The couple, fearing they had been duped by a fraudster, contacted police who arrested Cookes at her home in Shropshire.

Kieran Rainey, mitigating, said: ‘The whole case is one steeped in sadness. There is the couple’s difficulty in having their own child and the false hope Miss Cookes gave them, and also the tragedy of her own loss in 2008.

‘Even today, when she looks back, she doesn’t see offering surrogacy as a bad thing, but she immediately became involved in a deception which she now truly regrets.’

Cookes, of Ferndale Drive, Telford, admitted fraud by false representation, and in a letter read out to the court apologised for the  hurt she caused. ‘I truly am sorry,’ she wrote. ‘Now I am in intensive therapy, I can see that I never dealt with my grief after my daughter’s sudden death and I am sorry this caused me to hurt other people.

‘I hope to resolve my mental illness…this will never erase my mistake, though. Never again will I get myself into trouble…I never want to hurt anyone else again.’

Cookes was given a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay the couple £1,890 in compensation.

The Judge, Recorder Ben Nolan QC, told her: ‘You have pleaded guilty to a very cruel and hurtful fraud…There was a great deal of sophistication and deliberation about that deception.’

He added: ‘Your victims were particularly vulnerable because their natural and unfulfilled desire was to have children.

‘They resorted to what, to some extent, was a last resort. It is little wonder to me that [the wife], in particular, having realised that she was misled in such a cruel way,  has suffered quite serious psychological consequences.’
