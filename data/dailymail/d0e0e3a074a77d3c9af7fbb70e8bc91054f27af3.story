When travellers set up camp next to their picturesque village, the people of Hardhorn knew they were in for a long struggle.

And so it proved – with taxpayers spending £200,000 on four years of legal battles and planning inquiries.

Finally however, the four Irish and Scottish families – and their 60 caravans – have been given their marching orders.

Evicted: Travellers have been ordered to leave this site in Hardhorn, Lancashire despite trying to use human rights laws in order to stay

Opposition: The 78 Irish travellers had refused to budge despite facing three different courts, a planning inquiry, a council, and a battle by locals who accused the group of trashing their village

Yesterday residents of the Lancashire 
village, which has featured in BBC’s Gardener’s World, were celebrating 
victory over their ‘neighbours from hell’.

The saga began in November 2009 when a farmer sold the travellers a field on the outskirts of Hardhorn, which is near Blackpool.

The group of around 30 adults and 40 children immediately began to lay down concrete and rig up lighting for their mobile homes.

Site: The travellers set up camp after sneaking in overnight in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation' after council offices had closed for the weekend

Angry villagers wrote to councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices.

There were also numerous complaints of poaching, trespassing, barking dogs and verbal abuse.

Officials
 at Fylde District Council won an injunction barring the illegal 
development, only for a county court judge to rule the camp should have a
 postcode to allow  the travellers to claim benefits and summon the 
emergency services.

Maxine Chew, parish councillor said the residents are 'relieved' their ordeal is over

Neighbours: Villagers in Hardhorn had campaigned to have the traveller's evicted after the group moved in in November 2009

A series
 of legal hearings followed, including a planning inquiry, until, this 
week, the Supreme Court ruled against the travellers.

The council is now
 taking legal advice in the hope that it can now evict without further 
court challenges.

Yesterday 
parish councillor Maxine Chew said: ‘We are all hugely relieved that 
this saga is finally coming to an end but it’s such a pity so much time 
and a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this.

‘This case shows how much the legal 
system in this country needs to change.

The travellers have been able to
 drag things out by constantly appealing and it is costing taxpayers 
enormous sums.’

Branding
 them ‘neighbours from hell’, she added: ‘The amount of antisocial 
behaviour like fly tipping, theft and drunkenness has escalated hugely 
in the past four years since the travellers set up camp.

‘Everyone is now hoping and praying that the eviction process can take place without any more trouble or legal hiccups.

‘This
 is a very small and close-knit community and I congratulate the 
villagers on the way that they have conducted themselves in the past 
four years.

‘They are all so
 pleased that they can start to turn their small community back into the
 place it was before.’

A spokesman for Fylde Council said a report was 
being prepared for councillors but that ‘we believe the travellers have 
now exhausted their last legal avenue’.

Mark Menzies, Conservative MP for 
Fylde, said: ‘I know residents have been awaiting this decision by the 
Supreme Court for some time so I’m sure they are pleased things can now 
begin to move forward once again.’

Last night one of the travellers insisted there was no question of them moving out.

Arguing
 there were no legal traveller camps in the area to move to, Sharlene 
Collins said: ‘We are not going anywhere, we have no place to go, we are
 homeless.

Find us a place, we have nowhere to go. They are treating us 
like animals.

‘They let people come in from Europe and yet they won’t find us a place. We’ve no place to go.’

And in an apparent threat, she added: ‘We are not moving – at the end of the day it will cost the council millions to move us.’
