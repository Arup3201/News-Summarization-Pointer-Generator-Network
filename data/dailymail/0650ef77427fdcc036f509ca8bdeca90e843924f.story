She caused outrage for suing a burglary victim after falling over a kerb during a 999 call.

Now PC Kelly Jones has done it again by demanding compensation from her own force over a car crash.

The constable was in a police car which skidded off the road and ended on its side during a chase in January last year.

PC Jones put in a compensation claim to Norfolk Constabulary, which would not discuss details. Her lawyers said she injured her knee and her employers accepted liability.

Seven months after this claim she instructed the firm to sue Norfolk petrol station owner Steve Jones.

The divorced mother of two fell on a kerb while helping him look for burglars at the garage in August last year, hurting her left leg and right wrist.

After her astonishing claim became public, her own Chief Constable, Phil Gormley, criticised it as ‘surprising and disappointing’.

PC Jones is pursuing both claims. Her lawyers, Pattinson Brewer, said: ‘Kelly believes she has the right to go to work and not be harmed by someone else’s negligence.’

How the MoS broke the story: The Mail on Sunday led the way on this issue a week ago with its front-page exclusive on WPC Jones, pictured right, which provoked a huge amount of controversy and intense public debate. More than 1,500 readers posted comments on the MailOnline, nearly all of them scathing about her decision to sue the garage owner.

The news comes two days after the Mail
 revealed that PC Richard Seymour is suing a Surrey burglary victim for 
£10,000 after allegedly tearing his Achilles tendon falling into a 
drain.

The Police Federation is backing PC Jones’s action against Mr 
Jones, who is not related to the officer. It says she wants to claw back
 ‘lost earnings’.

But it is understood she has lost only overtime and 
night shift pay as she was on a full salary while recovering from both 
incidents.

PC Jones is on sick leave but is due back on active duty soon.

More than 8,000 police officers have 
claimed £67million compensation in the past four years, figures show.

The Police Federation data led to calls for a review of the system.

÷ Further examples of the out of 
control compensation culture emerged yesterday - this time in the fire 
service.

In East Sussex, a  fireman who hurt his hand on a locker won 
£250,000.

Another won a payout after he was  injured avoiding a runaway 
cow, and a third was compensated after catching his fingers in a vacuum 
cleaner.

  Police have sought huge sums for controversial claims. Among them are:

COMMENT by BRIAN PADDICK Former Deputy Met Assistant Commissioner

Analysis: Brian Paddick, Former Deputy Met Assistant Commissioner

The news that a police officer is suing someone who called for help will be met with astonishment among members of the public and incredulity among many of her fellow officers, particularly those of my vintage.

An increasing number of people are reluctant to call for assistance because they do not believe the police will be able to do anything. Now they could also be concerned that the officers might end up suing them. How did we get to this desperate state of affairs?

In the mid-Seventies when I started out on my police career, if you stumbled over a step or uneven paving slab, colleagues would say, ‘Enjoy your trip? Send us a postcard next time!’ There was no question of suing anyone, even if sometimes there may have been good reason.

After the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival riot, we began public order training. Our riot helmets were reinforced cork and plastic and we used real bricks in training.

Inevitably a colleague got a brick square on the badge on the front of his helmet and the pin holding it in place went straight into his forehead, blood streaming down his face. To complain would have been seen as being a sissy, to sue unthinkable. But the officer was allowed as much time to recuperate, on full pay, as he wanted. The helmets were soon replaced with proper Nato-style crash helmets and wooden blocks replaced the lumps of brick.

A sign that things were changing came a decade later, when I responded to an ambulance crew’s call for assistance. I ended up rolling around on the pavement with the drunken man who had attacked them. When he had sobered up, he made a formal complaint and an investigation was launched. In interview, I was asked whether I had suffered any injury during the fight, to which I replied: ‘Not really, just a few scratches and grazes to my hands.’ The final report found I had not acted unreasonably, but I received a formal disciplinary finding against me for not recording the scrapes as an injury on duty.

In those days, police officers who performed acts of bravery were praised by their bosses without hesitation.

But in 2003 a serving and former Met Commissioner faced trial under the Health And Safety At Work Act after two officers in separate incidents fell through roofs while chasing suspects; one officer sadly died and the other was seriously injured. While the Commissioners were not convicted, the police attitude to acts of bravery changed. Among other things, officers were told that they must not climb over a certain height, even if chasing a criminal or trying to save a life.

I remember in 2005 attending a Commissioner’s Commendation ceremony at New Scotland Yard. As a video shot from a police helicopter showed officers chasing suspects across steeply sloping rooftops, the senior officers in the audience sat ashen-faced, petrified that someone would report them to the Health and Safety Executive.

Police officers have got to realise that policing is a potentially dangerous business. Part of the thrill of being an operational officer is never knowing what is around the next corner or what challenge is going to face you.

Officers are protected by the courts, often being awarded damages against those who assault them as part of the criminal sanction passed by the judge.

The bottom line is, police officers are protected financially from the kind of injury that the officer who tripped up the step at the filling station claims to be suffering from. Nothing should get in the way of victims calling the police. Pain and a damaged ego are part of the job and, as we used to say: ‘If you can’t take a joke, you shouldn’t have joined.’
