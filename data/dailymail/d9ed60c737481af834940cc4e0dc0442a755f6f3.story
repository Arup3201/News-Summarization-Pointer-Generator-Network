Police are hunting a reckless vandal who cut the brakes on a disabled man's mobility scooter.

Graham Parkinson, 36, who broke his back in a go-karting accident in 2009, was shocked to discover the brake cables on his disability vehicle had been severed - putting his safety and that of other pedestrians at risk.

Mr Parkinson, who has extremely limited mobility, said he has previously been plagued by yobs ringing his buzzer late at night and fears the same culprits are to blame.
