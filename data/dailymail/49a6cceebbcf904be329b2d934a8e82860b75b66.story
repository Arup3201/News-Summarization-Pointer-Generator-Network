A woman who had just finished performing at a clown show in New Jersey has some fellow clowns to thank after she crashed her car into a utility pole.

About 10 clowns had finished putting on a show at Berkeley Avenue Elementary School in Westwood on Monday and departed in their respective cars.

But the clowns' cars came to a halt when they saw another clown in need.

Jack 'Poppi T Clown' Erbstein told The Record that the woman was reaching for a GPS device that fell off the windshield when she veered off the road.

Police Chief Frank Regino says the 68-year-old, from Fair Lawn, sustained minor injuries.

The clowns are members of Call Us Clowns, a not-for-profit organization that performs clown shows at schools and hospitals.

Erbstein told the newspaper that around 10 clowns had attended the day camp.

The woman, whose name hasn't been revealed, initially refused to go to hospital.

But she did so after she was persuaded by her clown colleagues at the scene, Erbstein said.

She was transported to Hackensack University Medical Center at Pascack Valley with minor injuries, Regino said.

According to The Record her car suffered substantial damage in the crash.

Westwood police Sgt. Matthew McClutchy said the incident was under investigation.
