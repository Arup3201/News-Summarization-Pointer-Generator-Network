A woman and her brother-in-law have been charged with the murder of a 20-year-old mother who was tortured and burned to death because villagers believed she was a witch.

Janet Ware, 28, and her relative, Andrew Watea, 33, were said by police to have been responsible for burning to death young mother Kepari Leniata in the central highlands of Papua New Guinea earlier this month.

The shocking death of Miss Leniata, whom villagers believed had used sorcery to kill the six-year-old son of Miss Watea, made international headlines and prompted a widespread manhunt through the jungles of central Papua New Guinea.

In dawn raids on a number of villages, more than 100 people were detained and questioned about the fiery murder – and all were released except the two who have now been charged.

Provincial police commander Superintendent Martin Lakari told The National newspaper that the pair were charged after ‘intensive questioning’ of all those rounded up in the raids.

Scores of people had gathered at a rubbish tip when Miss Leniata was dragged there, ordered to strip, doused with petrol and set alight.

Burning tyres were thrown onto her body as she screamed in pain but police, who had rushed to the area after hearing reports that a ‘witch’ was to be burned were forced back by the jeering crowd.

Miss Leniata was accused by close relatives of the dead boy of using sorcery to bring about his death. He had complained of severe stomach pain and died later in hospital.

Villagers claimed that Miss Leniata had confessed under torture of using sorcery against the boy, but there was no evidence of this.

Still alive: Sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in Papua New Guinea's highlands

Superintendent Lakari said that hours after Miss Ware and her brother-in-law were arrested, police charged a villager with the torture of two elderly women who were accused by locals of practising sorcery.

The women, who had been tied to posts, were rescued by police shortly before they, too, were about to be burned alive.

‘We are not finished from here,’ said the superintendent.

‘We are continuing investigations into these cases and if any evidence or reports come in later saying that other people involved are still at large, we will also arrest them.’

The young mother was tossed screaming on to a pyre of tyres and burned alive after being accused of killing a neighbour's six-year-old son with sorcery.

Kepari Leniata, 20, was said to have 'confessed' after she was dragged from her hut, stripped naked and tortured with white-hot iron rods.

She was then dragged to a local rubbish dump, doused in petrol and, with hands and feet bound, thrown on a fire of burning tyres. As the mother-of-two screamed in agony, more petrol-soaked tyres were thrown on top of her.

The tragedy unfolded after Miss Leniata's
young neighbour fell sick earlier this month. He complained of pains in
the stomach and chest and was taken to Mt Hagen hospital where he died a
few hours later.

Relatives of the boy were suspicious 
that witchcraft was involved in the death and learned that two women had
gone into hiding in the jungle.

After they were tracked down, the pair admitted they practised sorcery but had nothing to do with the boy's death. Miss Lanieta, they said, was the person responsible.

The boy's family went to her hut at 7am on Wednesday, stripped her and dragged her away to torture and death.

Pictures of the horrific scene were soon circulating online. The 
Post Courier newspaper said the torture and brutal murder of a mother of
two ‘provided a photo opportunity for many of the onlookers, including 
school children, who crowded around and took photos of the woman being 
consumed alive by the fire.’

Police who rushed to the area were 
turned back by the angry crowd, but were able to drive away with one of
the other women while the second has fled.

Part of the culture: Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea, which brought in a Sorcery Act to protect against attacks on those accused of practising black magic (file picture)

Breaking the law: The criminalisation of sorcery has seen several cases of violent vigilante action against 'witches' and 'sorcerers' in highland villages

Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation.

The cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a bag of rice,

In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice.

However the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by ‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders.

As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law.

Last July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and use their genitals for sorcery rituals.

In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery.

A firetruck which had been called to the scene was chased away by the crowd.

Authorities and international diplomats have spoken out against the torching of the young mother, leaves behind two children, the youngest an eight-month-old girl.

The country's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill had promised to bring the killers to justice.

‘No one commits such a despicable act in the society that all of us, including Kepari, belong to,' he said.

‘Barbaric killings connected with alleged sorcery. Violence against women because of this belief that sorcery kills. These are becoming all too common in certain parts of the country.

'It is reprehensible that women, the old and the weak in our society should be targeted for alleged sorcery or wrongs that they actually have nothing to do with.’

The U.S. embassy on the Papua New Guinea issued a statement condemning the "’brutal murder’ calling it evidence of ‘pervasive gender-based violence’.

’We add our voice to those of Papua New Guinean religious and civil society leaders who have spoken out against the brutality inflicted upon Ms Lanieta,’ the embassy said.

‘There is no possible justification for this sort of violence. We hope that appropriate resources are devoted to identifying, prosecuting, and punishing those responsible for Ms Lanieta's murder.’
