Changes to Facebook's data sharing policies will make it almost impossible for presidential candidates to replicate Barack Obama's success on the site.

The 2012 reelection campaign won over voters under the age of 29 using an app that supporters could share with their friends.

Analysts could view each supporter's friends list and construct a sophisticated database of who to target, rather than the traditional get-out-the-vote ring rounds made difficult as so few young people have listed phone numbers.

However, as of April 2015, third-party applications will only be able to see users who download the app, not their associates.

Clamp down: Facebook has changed its data-sharing policies that will block third-party applications, such as this one used by Obama's 2012 campaign, from accessing users' friends lists to target fresh voters

Experts who developed the sophisticated voter-targeting system, which was credited with redefining the limits of viral politics, claim the change will pose a significant challenge for the next cycle.

'It's a fairly significant shift,' Teddy Goff, Obama's digital director in 2012, told Yahoo News.

'The thing we did that will be most affected - by which I mean rendered impossible - by the changes they're making is the targeted sharing tool,' Goff added.

Obama's youth-focused campaign seemed to be shaken by early statistics that revealed half their swing-state voters under 30 did not have listed numbers.

Consequently, they opted to use Facebook as a replacement for the traditional telephone directory.

They raised more than $690 million over the internet and amassed more than 45 million Facebook followers. 

Romney's campaign used a less sophisticated version of the system for just a few days before Election Day. 

Goff added: 'It's extremely powerful for a campaign to be able to say to [a user], "Hey, here are your persuadable friends, ranked in order of where they live: Ohio first, Virginia second, et cetera. Go share this video directly with them".'

'Groundbreaking': Campaign experts branded Obama's digital voter-targeting in 2012 'revolutionary'. The team directed adverts to supporters' friends. Analysts believed Romney (right) suffered by not using the strategy

Patrick Ruffini, a Republican digital strategist who worked on George W Bush’s 2004 campaign, hailed the strategy as the future of outreach.

Next year's change was announced by Facebook in April this year after receiving complaints about privacy.

'People want more control over sharing their personal information with apps,' Jeffrey Spehar, Facebook's engineering manager, wrote in a blog post.

He added: 'We've heard from people that they're often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app. 

'So we've updated Facebook Login so that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list.'

The Ready For Hillary page, set up earlier this year on Facebook, will be able to gather a certain amount of data for the Democrats before April - but the figures will be more than a year out of date by Election Day.

Meanwhile the Republican Party does not have any form of campaign page.

However, Will St Clair, software engineer for Obama's reelection bid, insists 'the writing has been on the wall for a long time'. 

'On the friend list issue, I was very skeptical that would last,' he told MailOnline. 

'Even with access, the information wasn't always complete enough for an accurate match against the voter file. 

'Many users' privacy settings blocked these fields, and there is increasing awareness of privacy issues in general.'

He told MailOnline that Facebook's understanding of its audience is far more sophisticated just three years on. 

After uploading an advert, an organization can trust Facebook to serve it to users that will be interested. 

Last chance: The Ready For Hillary campaign page will be able to farm current supporters' information and track friend lists before April 2015. But that information will be more than a year out of date by Election Day

'Many organizations were treating social as unlimited free earned media,' he said. 

'The idea that an existing relationship with your supporters exempts you from having to pay the piper strikes me as a bit disingenuous.

'We were successful at getting people to share content with friends who were higher-priority targets for us, but it was still very organic. 

'It's hard to argue that it made a substantial difference, especially compared to the size and sophistication of our field, digital, and traditional media programs. 

'Facebook will do whatever it takes to keep your feed enjoyable to read: they need to sell ads on it. Ads are where the game is (perhaps always was) for campaigns.'
