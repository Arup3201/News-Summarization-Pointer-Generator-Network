This secluded riverboat could be a lifesaver for anyone looking to get onto the property ladder - a converted oil rig rescue pod.

The compact and bijou residence was once a free-fall lifeboat on the Murdoch North Sea oil platform.

Current owner Jeff Doyle, 44, bought it on the internet two years ago and transported it by crane to Bath Marina in Bath, Somerset.

He fitted it with a wood burning stove, plush wood floors and a flat-screen TV and the vessel is powered by a Lister engine.

It
is now being sold with an asking price of £23,000 by estate agents 
Andrews, which describes the one-bedroom pad as 'unique and intriguing'.

Firefighter Mr Doyle said: 'I’ve loved 
living on it and the only reason I’m selling it is because I’ve bought a
great big house boat with my girlfriend. I guess it contributed to me getting a girlfriend.'

Estate agent Euan Woodman of Andrews, 
said: 'It is a real talking point, and the first time we have had to 
sell something like this.

'We have sold narrow boats and barges before, but nothing like this.

'It is fantastic, a really unique boat that looks completely different to everything else in the marina.'
