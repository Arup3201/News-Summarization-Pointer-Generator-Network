More than one million Americans have gone online in the past 24 hours to sign up for health insurance, it has been revealed.

A last-minute rush of shoppers visited the the ever-breaking healthcare.gov yesterday - what was supposed to be the final day people could enroll for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

However, the deadline has now been extended to tonight to give more people a chance to sign up.

Not working: The malfunctioning website has now deployed a queuing system to deal with the high traffic

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on Twitter the website had 'surpassed a million site visits', according to ABC News. 

A staggering 850,000 of these visits happened before 2pm (7pm GMT), according to CMS spokesman Julie Bataille.

This followed more than 1.2million site hits at the weekend.

The website - which has faced a series of problems since its launch - has deployed a queuing system to deal with the high traffic.

This means more than 60,000 potential 
customers have been forced to leave an email address to be invited back 
later when the traffic is lighter.

Extension: Yesterday was supposed to be the final day people could enroll for 'Obamacare' under the Affordable Care Act. However, the deadline has now been extended to today to allow more people to sign up

President Barack Obama (pictured left at a basketball game in Hawaii on Sunday) has insisted he is doing all he can to make sure people who miss the deadline can still get health insurance under a series of exemptions

Ms
 Bataille told people wanting 'Obamacare' to 'sign up today' - but 
added: 'if you have trouble due to high-demand, we will make sure we 
help you get signed up'. 

Customer Liz Meitner, 56, told TV crews at a Washington library that she had been trying to sign up for health insurance - which kicks in on January 1 - since enrollment first became available, but had so far been unsuccessful.

The
 President of the United States didn't have to test his patience with 
the error-prone website or spend hours on the phone with a volunteer 
'navigator' in order to sign up for new health insurance.

A White House official has confirmed that 
Obama simply dispatched his aides to the Washington, D.C. insurance 
exchange's office, where they filed his papers in person – while Obama 
himself luxuriated in his annual Hawaiian vacation with his family.

'His situation is unique,' the official insisted.

'The
 president couldn't have used the DC exchange's website because the 
databases these sites use to confirm insurance eligibility wouldn't 
contain those sorts of records about him.'

Obama
 chose 'a bronze plan' – the cheapest option – according to the White 
House. But an official statement conceded the exercise 'is symbolic 
since the president’s health care will continue to be provided by the 
military.'

'The implementation has been unsuccessful as far as I'm concerned so far - I'm almost in shock', she said at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.

'It's just so hard to believe they could be so inefficient with something so important.'

The deadline for people to sign up for health care coverage was supposed to be 11.59pm yesterday.

However, due to the site's record traffic, the deadline has been pushed back to midnight tonight, according to The Washington Post.

The
 White House has insisted that it is doing all it can to make sure 
people who miss the deadline can still get coverage under a series of 
exemptions, and apparently this date bait-and-switch is another way of 
trying to help.

There is a 'hardship' exception for 
some that permits them not to sign up any kind of health insurance at 
all without facing a penalty - the hardship being problems they've 
encountered with Obamacare and its malfunctioning website.

There will also be a 'good faith exception' for others, according to a senior Obama administration official.

'We'll
 have a special enrollment period,' the official said last week, for 
'all those who make a good faith effort to get enrolled by the deadline'
 but fail to do so.

The official did not say how the government would determine whether or not the effort was made in good faith.

Still, others may simply get a break 
from insurance companies, which the administration has urged to be 
flexible with people who miss the deadline.

Such
 is the uncertain state of 'Obamacare' as it approaches what was 
originally supposed to be a defining moment - a signup deadline that 
would provide the first real test of the viability of the healthcare 
program brought into law by the Affordable Care Act.

Adding to the confusion is the fact that the original deadline for obtaining medical coverage was December 15.

That
 was extended to December 23 after the federal government's website, 
HealthCare.gov, proved dysfunctional and sometimes non-functional. 

Obama
 said on Friday that one million people had enrolled for new insurance 
plans under the law through HealthCare.gov, which serves 36 states, and 
14 state-run marketplaces.

Trying everything: President and Mrs Obama met with a group of mothers last week in an effort to persuade them to have their children sign up for the healthcare insurance

Many
 more enrollments are a major priority for Obama's signature healthcare 
reform, which officials are still hoping will help millions of uninsured
 and under-insured Americans finally to obtain medical coverage by the 
end of March.

It is not 
known how many consumers may have no insurance coverage during periods 
of 2014 if they failto sign up on HealthCare.gov today.

The
 Obama administration says it is trying to be flexible, but some 
Republican critics of the law say the frequent delays and changes have 
muddied the waters and confused people.

'With no clarity as to when people 
should sign up and who they should pay and when, it's a virtual 
certainty that many consumers will find themselves uncovered for a 
period of time through no fault of their own,' Senator Orrin Hatch, a 
Utah Republican, said last week.

Administration
 officials said on Friday there are fewer than 500,000 people who have 
received cancellation notices from their insurance companies and have 
not yet found alternatives.

Some were 'auto-enrolled' in other plans by their insurance companies, the officials said.

The
 pace of sign-ups has picked up since October and November when 
technical problems crippled the HealthCare.gov website. Anyone who tried
 the website in October and November and became stuck has been getting 
attention from the administration.

Officials
 sent more than two million emails to people who could not advance 
through the website.

They have also made more than 600,000 phone calls 
to consumers and mailed notices to hundreds of thousands of people, 
officials said.

'We are 
confident that we are doing everything we can so that individuals know 
what their options are to get coverage, whether it is at the marketplace
 or seeking it through the private insurers,' said the senior official.
