A police officer and clown have been caught on camera brawling on a busy street corner, much to the amusement of passing drivers. 

Mitch Cooper saw the clown attacking the officer and caught the antics on his cellphone camera after he pulled up at the stoplight last Friday.

The clown was approached after police were told that he was running in traffic, chasing cars with a squirt gun in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

At first, one officer is seen calmly talking to the man in fancy dress before the clown swings a punch and the pair end up rolling around on the ground.

Another officer soon arrives and the two manage to pin the clown down.

Mr Cooper told ABC7:'It was funny to witness, probably not so fun for the clown, but as a spectator it was pretty entertaining.'

According to authorities the clown is known for making protests outside official buildings. He was arrested for  disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.
