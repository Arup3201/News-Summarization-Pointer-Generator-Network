A popular Colorado teacher has passed away after struggling with depression, his family has said.

Mitchell Hanson, a social studies teacher at Smoky Hill High School in Aurora, died 'suddenly and accidentally from complications of depression and substance use disorder' on Friday, his mother said.

'Mitch was only 28 years old and he was taken from us too soon,' Penny Hanson wrote on Facebook.

News of the young teacher's death shocked students at Smoky Hill High, who became emotional as they remembered him as an inspiring and fun educator.

'He was much more than a teacher for me and I can honestly say he was one of my friends,' student Jordan Vaz told KDVR. 'He always knew how to put a smile on people's faces. He was amazing.'

Mr Hanson had been on leave from the school since November, Smoky Now reported, and earlier this month, he wrote on Facebook that he would be shutting down his account starting February 1.

'I don't know a lot of the circumstances surrounding his death but it is a tragedy and it shouldn't have happened to someone like him,' another student, Logan Sublett, said.

Hanson had taught at the school for nearly four years. As well as teaching students social studies, he also coached the drum band and directed the Mock Trial program.

There were no classes on Monday due to the federal holiday, but on Tuesday, students planned to go to school wearing orange because it was his favorite color.

Fun-loving: Students shared photos they had taken with Hanson, who'd worked at the school for four years

'The world truly is a little less bright with the loss of such a passionate and caring man. I'll never forget you Mr. Hanson,' another added.

On Monday, the Cherry Creek School District said its thoughts and prayers are with the Hanson family.

A memorial service will be held for the teacher on Saturday.
