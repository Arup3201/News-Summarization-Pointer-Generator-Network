The husband who shot dead his wife and her new boyfriend late on Monday in an ambush on a rural Kentucky road in a hail of bullets used an assault rifle and handgun to commit his vicious act of revenge.

Shaun Hiles, 35, whose wife Nicole Hiles, also, 35, then turned the rifle on himself, shooting himself in the stomach and the chest, but failed to end his own life.

The attack came just hours after Hiles had posted angry Facebook messages revealing he knew his wife was in a new relationship with Larry Whiteker, 32 and eight hours after Nicole filed an emergency restraining order against her estranged husband.

Police in the tiny town of Dry Ridge say that Hiles rammed his truck into Whiteker's truck around 11.30 pm after chasing them and then when they had both crashed opened fire with a .357 caliber handgun, killing his wife and then used an AR-15 to shot dead Whiteker.

On Facebook, Shaun posted several times about discovering his wife's infidelity — and gave out grim warnings about what might come next.

'The moment when you check your cell phone bills and you catch your wife cheating on you priceless,' posted on Thursday.

Then next day, he wrote, 'The war has began!!!!!!! [sic]'

Police in Kentucky say that Shaun Hiles rammed into the car driven by his wife Nicole's new boyfriend, Larry Whiteker, and shot them both dead once the cars stopped spinning

On Monday, Nicole had called Grant County Sheriff Chuck Dills around 3pm and asked for legal protection against her irate husband.

However, it was too late in the day and by the time a judge would have been able to sign it, she and her new boyfriend had been shot dead.

'Talking to her, we learned she's separated from her husband, marital problems, he's tearing her stuff up and I advised her if she had been threatened, she could get an emergency protection order,' Grant County Sheriff Chuck Dills told the Cincinnati Enquirer.

'He (Shaun) had been chasing after them,' Dills told the newspaper. 'We're learning that his wife was seeing this other person and he was upset over it.'

Spurned: On Facebook, Shaun Hiles posted grim warnings about what he expected out of separating his wife Nicole

Earlier the day of the shooting, Nicole Hiles asked Sheriff Chuck Dills for an emergency protective order because her husband had been 'bothering her.'

Hiles is currently in a critical condition at the intensive care unit of University of Cincinnati Medical Center said police and Dills said that it may be some time before he can be questioned.

Hiles and his wife have a 14-year-old daughter together and Nicole Hiles has a child from a previous relationship said Dills.

It was also revealed that Hills has a violent past - he has a separate misdemeanor battery case that is pending in Dearborn Couty and was scheduled to appear in court on Friday.

He is accused of punching a co-worker and beating him with an aluminum tire iron in the parking lot of a trucking company .

'My office has been involved in a couple calls, at least, involving this married couple, the Hileses,' Dill told WXIX-TV.

'There’s been domestic disputes over property and things like that.'
