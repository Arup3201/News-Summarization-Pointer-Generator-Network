Since she was a baby, Danielle Sheehan has suffered painful bouts of eczema.

As a child the debilitating condition subsided. But four years ago  red patches returned on her arms and around her eyes.

The model and dancer's self-esteem crumbled. She stopped booking photo shoots at work and refused to see her boyfriend during flare ups.

The eczema around her eyes was aggravated by moisture, becoming particularly painful when she cried.

She visited her doctor time and time again, trying tablets, creams, lotions and other remedies.

But to no avail. The painful patches persisted, making Miss Sheehan's life a misery.

A year ago the 24-year-old visited a cosmetic surgeon to have Botox, curious to see the cosmetic benefits.

Danielle Sheehan, 24, from Suffolk has suffered painful bouts of eczema since she was a baby. After trying countless treatments including creams, ointments and light therapy she was shocked when Botox appeared to cure the skin condition 

The model and dancer said she first had Botox, for purely cosmetic reasons, around 18 months ago. Her eczema was aggravated when she cried, with painful patches around her eyes. But five days after having the cosmetic procedure she noticed the patches had completely cleared up

Not only did the treatment leave her forehead and face without trace of any lines, the procedure appeared to clear up her eczema.

Miss Sheehan, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, told MailOnline: 'I've always suffered from eczema, ever since I can remember.

'During my childhood it seemed to get a bit better but then, about four years ago it came back.

'I developed symmetrical patches in the creases of both arms, and then patches around my eyes as well.

'I obviously went to the doctors and tried literally everything - tablets, creams - everything.

'Nothing was working, even three months of light therapy treatment failed to make any difference.

'My self-esteem and confidence was really bad, it dragged me down.

Eczema is a dry skin condition. Also known as dermatitis, it is highly individual, and varies from person to person.

In mild cases the skin is dry, scaly, red and itchy.

In more severe cases there may be weeping, crusting and bleeding.

In the UK, one if five children and one in 12 adults have the condition.

Keeping the skin moisturised using emollients (medical moisturisers) is key to managing all types of the conditon.

Topical steroids are commonly used to bring flare ups under control.

'I'm a model and a dancer and so my work really suffered.

'I stopped booking photo shoots, my eyes were so bad I didn't want to see my boyfriend and I used to have to put socks on my hands at night to stop me scratching.

'It had a huge impact on my life.' 

A year-and-a-half ago Miss Sheehan first had Botox.

'It wasn't something I was doing to actively help my eczema,' she explained.

'I was going along for purely cosmetic reasons.'

Shortly after her treatment, Miss Sheehan discovered her then boyfriend had been cheating on her.

'I cried and cried, longer than ever before,' she said. 

But a day later, around five days after her Botox, Miss Sheehan said her mother was shocked at how fresh faced her daughter looked despite crying so much.

'By then the Botox had started to work,' she told MailOnline. 'It often takes five to seven days.

'My mum was really shocked, I was fresh faced. There was no sign of the red, angry patches of eczema that would flare up after I had been crying.'

Miss Sheehan said told MailOnline her eczema was so bad she would cancel work and stop seeing her boyfriend, suffering low self-esteem

Almost overnight her confidence returned, as her eczema disappeared.

'I can't really describe it,' she said. 'It felt amazing. All of a sudden I felt good again.

'For the first time in years I liked how I looked, I liked what I saw in the mirror.

'It was so good. I told my surgeon and she said there is some research to suggest Botox is good for eczema.'

Botox is used to help treat a number of different medical conditions.

It has been found to help overactive bladder symptoms - the strong need to urinate with incontinence, prevent headaches in those suffering chronic migrane.

She said almost overnight her confidence returned. 'For the first time in years, I liked how I looked,' she told MailOnline

It has also been found to help treat increased muscle stiffness in the elbow, wrist and finger muscles, as well as abnormal head positions and neck pain as a result of cervical dystonia.

And research has found Botox can help treat eye muscle conditions, including the abnormal spasm of the eyelid in those aged over 12.

In 2012, a study published by scientists at Edinburgh University, found Botox may be able to resolve itchy skin and eczema.

A female patient who suffered itchy skin on her arms and torso for more than a decade experienced a dramatic reduction in her symptoms following Botox injections to the areas affected.

The positive effects of the procedure were noted for a period of six months.

Indeed, Miss Sheehan said she has had repeated bouts of the treatment since realising it has proved effective.

She urged scientists to invest more time in researching Botox as a cure for the skin condition, in the hope it could be used as a treatment on the NHS in future.

'At £300 a go, it is pretty expensive,' she told MailOnline. 'But it works. I think it should be available free of charge to those people with really bad eczema.

'Obviously I like the cosmetic effects but my eczema is the reason I have Botox now.

'The results are really amazing. Literally everyone says how fresh faced I look now.

'My eczema used to really drag me down but now it's gone. For the first time in a really long time, I like the way I look.' 

It is thought Botox helps relieve the itchiness caused by eczema in the same way it treats wrinkles.

The drug inhibits acetylcholine, a chemical that helps notify the muscles to contract.
