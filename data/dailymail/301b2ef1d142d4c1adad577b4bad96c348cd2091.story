Footage showing a serious case of wave rage has emerged after a surfer from New Zealand seemed to get sick of fighting for space in the surf.

The 15 second video shot by Guy Mac sees Tim Thompson take out a Brazilian surfer in a massive tackle after he apparently kept cutting him off in the line up to take waves.

Thompson enters the frame from the left, travelling across the wave at a great speed.

A New Zealand surfer deliberately collided with a Brazilian man after he was cut off by the man 

He is still soaring across the surf when a Brazilian surfer drops in right in front of him.

Riding lower on the wave than his fellow surfer, Thompson then appears to make a sharp and deliberate cut upwards across the water.

The Kiwi then smashes into the other surfer, and the collision sends both men and their boards flying.

The two surfers disappear into the foam and Thompson's board shoots up into the air above the spot where the pair land.

Thompson told GoSurf.nz.co he was simply enjoying time out in the water with his mates when the waves got a little crowded.

The New Zealander said the 'crowd' didn't deter him from the water and was happy to just wait his turn and enjoy the rest of the session.

'Oh well, it was bound to happen at some point, so you just smile, wait you're turn and try enjoy the remainder of you're session (sic),' he told the website.

'This would work except the newcomers have a different attitude, continuous snaking, consecutive drop-ins and generally bad attitudes would make you think you have entered into a WQS (World qualifying series) final.'

'As luck would have it, one particular honing missile decided to head my way to fade me for the third consecutive time, let’s just say my exit off the wave was either poorly timed or perfectly executed, depending on how you look at the situation,' he said.
