Bitter Labour rivals Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling have finally agreed to ‘put their differences aside’ as they join forces in the battle against Scottish independence.

The Mail has learned that a private meeting between the former Prime Minister and the former Chancellor took place in recent days.

Although their relationship remains strained after feuding over the true scale of the financial crisis, an uneasy ‘truce’ has been agreed in the run-up to September’s referendum.

Campaign chiefs are now hopeful of persuading the pair to appear in public together under the ‘Better Together’ banner.

In his 2011 memoirs, Mr Darling – who is the chairman of Better Together – accused Mr Brown of ‘hopeless’ leadership and ‘appalling behaviour’ during his time in Downing Street.

Mr Darling, MP for Edinburgh South West, claimed that his boss was so misguided as Prime Minister that he believed the crippling economic downturn would be over in six months. The once close relationship between the pair finally ended when Mr Darling gave an interview in 2008 describing the financial outlook as the worst for 60 years.

Mr Brown has shied away from public appearances following his defeat in the 2010 General Election, and his main intervention in the referendum debate to date was to launch a separate pro-Union campaign, Unite with Labour. The organisation was created to appease Labour voters and union leaders who oppose sharing a platform with the Tories under the cross-party ‘Better Together’ banner.

But Mr Darling was singled out for praise by Mr Brown yesterday during the launch of the party’s campaign for this month’s Cowdenbeath by-election, in which the former Prime Minister warned that independence would lead to a ‘dog-eats-dog’ fight across the British Isles.

'I’m working very closely with Better Together,' Mr Brown said.

'I met people from Better Together only a few days ago, and I think Alistair is doing a great job. I think it’s very important that in addition to the Labour campaign which Johann has launched for Labour’s view of the future of Scotland, we have this all-party group leading up to the referendum. All of us will be working closely with Better Together in the next few months.'

The Mail understands the pair met in Westminster at the end of last year, and have since held face-to-face talks.

One source said they agreed to ‘put their differences aside’ for the sake of the Union’ and another insider said the frosty relationship has ‘thawed’.

As he returns from political exile, Mr Brown will speak at a public event in Lochgelly, Fife, this Saturday to outline the case against independence.

Yesterday, he appeared at the launch of the Cowdenbeath by-election campaign in the Ore Valley Business Centre in Lochgelly. Mr Brown’s Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath Westminster seat covers the Holyrood constituency, where the death of long-standing MSP Helen Eadie has triggered a by-election. The event was also attended by candidate Alex Rowley, Fife Council leader and Mr Brown’s election agent, Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont and Fife Provost Jim Leishman, the former Dunfermline football manager.

In an attack on Alex Salmond’s vision of Scottish independence, Mr Brown said: 'What the SNP are forgetting is that in the last 100 years, we created in Scotland and across the United Kingdom a pooling and sharing of resources, where everyone – irrespective of their nationality – has an equal right to healthcare, an equal right to unemployment benefit, an equal right to pensions, and all the benefits of the welfare state.

'If we decide that we want to give that up then people will have to be told by the SNP what the consequences are for pensioners, for young people, for people who are unemployed, for people who are sick and disabled.'

He said different minimum wage and corporation tax levels would lead to a ‘race to the bottom, a dog-eats-dog competition, divide-and-rule. And then all the benefits built up over a long period of time will be put at risk.'

SNP MSP Annabelle Ewing described Mr Brown's comments as 'hypocritical nonsense'.

'His remarks entirely ignore the fact that the UK has become a much more unequal society under successive Westminster governments, Tory and Labour,' she said.

'What Gordon Brown is saying is that vital social provisions such as welfare and the minimum wage are better decided by Tories at Westminster rather than in Scotland's own parliament, a position very out of touch with opinion in the Cowdenbeath constituency.'
