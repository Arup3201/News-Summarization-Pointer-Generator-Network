The reaction of older fans to Ronald Koeman’s appointment as Southampton manager may well be: 'Do I not like that'.

But it doesn’t mean they are casting dispersions about the 51-year-old Dutchman’s suitability to take over from Mauricio Pochettino on the south coast.

For all Koeman’s considerable achievements in the game, he is best-known to a generation of supporters for being at the centre of an infamous fly-on-the-wall TV documentary about Graham Taylor’s reign as England manager.

Signing on: Ronald Koeman (centre) will take over from Mauricio Pochettino as Southampton manager

Dutch delight: Ronald Koeman scores against England to deny them a place at the 1994 World Cup

Escape: Koeman escaped the foul with a yellow card and England got a free-kick outside the area

Helpless: Nothing went right for manager Graham Taylor that infamous night in Rotterdam in 1993

The Impossible Job, which spawned a thousand catchphrases, Koeman escapes a red card for a bad foul on David Platt and later scores the goal which knocked England out of playing in the 1994 World Cup.

As Koeman and his team-mates celebrate, a downtrodden Taylor tells the fourth official: ‘Tell your pal, he’s just cost me my job”.

Of course, Koeman’s career is about far more than that one Holland-England game but it’ll certainly come up whenever Southampton get a dodgy decision next season.

Koeman is one of many great Dutch players who have lit up the game since 1974. The difference between him and the likes of Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp is that he was a defender.

Nominally, he was a defender anyway. He played at the back but was best-known for his ability on the ball and his devastating free-kicks.

Bullet finish: Ronald Koeman scores for Barcelona in the European cup final in 1992 against Sampdoria

Pure joy: Koeman scored the only goal in the 1992 European Cup final for Barcelona against Sampdoria

The most famous one came for Barcelona against Sampdoria at Wembley in 1992 that gave Barca their first-ever European Cup. His goal tally of 193 is probably a world-record for a defender.

Koeman the player would walk into a Dutch all-time XI. In a 17-year playing career with Groningen, Ajax, PSV, Barcelona and Feyenoord he won nine league titles and two European Cups – the first with Guus Hiddink’s PSV in 1987.

As someone who worked under Cruyff at Barcelona, his instincts to play the right way will please Saints fans who loved the football under Pochettino and will be desperate to keep at least some of their bright young players like Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana at the club.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who played for Koeman at Ajax, said when he was with the Amsterdam club that Koeman’s talent as a player gave him an advantage over other managers.

Prolific: John Guidetti (centre) scored 20 goals for Feyenoord under Koeman in 2012

‘He was terrific. We’d be taking free-kicks and after a while he’d step in and blast some home,’ said the striker. 'Talk about respect, he’d only been with us two days and he had it from the lads. You could see he got on really well with them.’

But it’s one thing believing in the right thing and another being successful over the long term in the Premier League, as Koeman’s one-time Barca team-mate Michael Laudrup found at Swansea City last season.

So far, Koeman’s managerial career has not quite matched the stardust of his playing days though he can be proud that Holland’s defence in this World Cup is dominated by Feyenoord players he helped develop.

High point: Ronald Koeman led Feyenoord to two second-place finishes in the Dutch league

Talking tactics: Koeman gets his message across to his Benfica playes during training at Old Trafford in 2005

After starting out as Hiddink’s assistant with Holland at the 1998 World Cup and then performing the same role at Barcelona, Koeman became a  manager in his own right with Vitesse Arnhem in 2000.

He served Ajax, Benfica, PSV and AZ Alkmaar over the next decade with mixed effects. But his time in Rotterdam – scene of his famous foul on Platt – with Feyenoord was Koeman at his best, triumphing against the odds in a manner that clearly impressed the Southampton board.

Once-great Feyenoord were in ruins when Koeman took over in 2011. With no budget for transfers, they finished in the top three in each of his three seasons at the club – twice runners-up.

Even more impressively, the club’s Academy was voted the best in Holland, better even than Ajax.

Replacement: Koeman has taken over from Mauricio Pochettino who joined Tottenham in May

Top stuff: Southampton enjoyed an impressive Premier League campaign last season, finishing eighth

Further shades of Southampton came in the development of young players into the first-team. Jordy Clasie, Bruno Martins Indi, Stefan de Vrij, Terece Kongolo, Tonny Vilhena and Jean Paul Boëtius all went on to play for Holland having worked first under Koeman.

Having worked with young Manchester City striker John Guidetti when he scored 20 goals on loan for Feyenoord, you can expect Koeman to try and link up with him again at St Mary’s.

English football is obviously far more competitive than the Dutch Eredivisie. Instead of being a national hero like he was in Holland, Koeman is still regarded as a bogey-man by England fans over the age of 30. Without him, we may have gone to the 1994 World Cup in America and had a great time.

But if he can help uncover a few more Luke Shaw’s at Southampton, their fans might decide they do rather like him after all.

After what has seemed an interminable three weeks of speculation, Southampton seem to be on the verge of going Dutch with the appointment of Ronald Koeman as the replacement for Mauricio Pochettino, and that prospect has been met pretty positively among the Saints fanbase.

Koeman is of a pedigree unheard of at St Mary’s before, a multiple title winner as both player and manager, a genuine big name, while also having demonstrated a willingness and ability to bring young players through a club’s academy into the first team.

As a result, Koeman polling 67% in a four-way race with Claudio Ranieri, Murat Yakin and 'anyone else' probably comes as no surprise.

On the move? Luke Shaw has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Chelsea

Giant leaps have been made by the club in the last five years, Koeman could certainly be the man to ensure the perceived glass ceiling doesn’t get reached just yet.

His first task, and the key for the majority of the fanbase, will be to persuade last season’s stars that they still have a job to do on the South Coast and that there is no need to seek moves elsewhere as many of their ambitions can still be met here.

Whether he will be able to persuade Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren to remain is open to debate – their minds may have already been made up – but if they depart, he will need to ensure the cash received is reinvested wisely.

Unsurprisingly, we’re already being linked with young Dutch players in the press, and based on the national team’s demolition of Spain on Friday, that may not be a bad thing. It’s never a dull moment at Southampton, but hopefully things might at least settle down into some sort of sanity for a few months once this appointment is finalised.
