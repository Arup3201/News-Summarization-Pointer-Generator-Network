A solitary, strangely-shaped building known by locals as the 'doughnut' is all that will ever exist of what the Spanish hoped would become an ambitious 'Legal City' in Madrid. 

The Madrid Regional Government has cancelled the 500 million-euro project with just one building erected, due to lack of funding.

Around 19 million euros had already been invested in the plan, which is the latest in a number of Spanish projects forced to be cancelled because of the financial crisis.

The doughnut - more officially known as the Legal Medical Institute - is now nothing but an abandoned reminder, and has a sign outside banning people from entering.

The sorry building site is beside Barajas Airport, and also close to the Madrid Four Towers skyscrapers and Real Madrid sport city.

Spain was hit extremely hard by the recession, and this has resulted in a number of half-finished buildings being dotted around the country.

They include the InTempo skyscraper in Bedidorm - a 47-storey block of flats which was left without a lift - and the Nou Mestalla - a 61,500-seater football stadium designed to be the new home of Valencia, where construction started in 2007, but still sits unfinished.

What a doughnut! The Legal Medical Institute has accrued an unfortunate nickname from locals and now sits useless and abandoned

No entry: There is a sign outside the building banning people other than construction workers from going in, as weeds build up outside

All alone: The building was supposed to be the first stage of a proposed 'Legal City' - a project which would have cost 500 million euros

What a waste of money: The project had to be abandoned for financial reasons after 19 million euros was already spent on getting it up and running

Now what? The abandonment of the project has left a huge empty space in the Madrid suburbs, and is one of many failed building ideas in Spain

A meaningful sundown: The sun sets over the Legal Medical Institute and also on Spain's plans for an ambitious 'Legal City'

The long road to nowhere: A solitary cyclist pedals along the road in front of where other buildings in the 'Legal City' were supposed to stand
