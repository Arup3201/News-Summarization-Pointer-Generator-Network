Aston Villa are in talks over a deal for free agent Nicklas Bendtner.

The 26-year-old has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt but the former Arsenal striker wants to stay in the Premier League.

Villa are bringing players in on a shoestring budget and have made Bendtner an offer but discussions are ongoing as they try to strike an agreement.

Villa are allowing Nicklas Helenius to return to Aalborg on loan while Christian Benteke and Libor Kozak are out with long-term injuries. It means a return for Darren Bent and a need for more cover with Bendtner the target.

Villa’s influential chief executive Paul Faulkner stepped down yesterday. Robin Russell, who has been chief financial officer, will step in as acting chief executive to maintain continuity.

Faulkner said: ‘I would like to thank Randy Lerner for the opportunity to become involved with Aston Villa and for the relationship we built over years, which pre-dated my time at the Club.

‘To the Villa fans, I am grateful for their support over the years, and for their passionate love for and loyalty to this great club, which deserves the very best.

‘I would like to make particular reference to the wonderful Villa staff both at Bodymoor Heath and Villa Park. They are an incredible group of people and it's been a privilege to lead and work with them on a daily basis.

'Villa is best in class in so many ways off the field and I only hope that success on the pitch follows.

‘I feel very humbled to have been able to spend such a long period of time amongst such special people at such a special club and I wish them, Paul Lambert and the squad all the very best for the future as I look to embark on the next stage of my career and a new challenge.’
