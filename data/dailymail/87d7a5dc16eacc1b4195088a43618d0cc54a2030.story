David Cameron has refused to publicly back the way Nick Clegg has handled scandalous allegations against former Lib Dem chief Lord Rennard.

The Prime Minister was asked if he had full confidence in Mr Clegg's handling of the affair.

Speaking from Riga where he is attending a forum with Baltic and Nordic leaders, the Prime Minister said: 'Obviously these are serious issues and serious matters and they need to be taken seriously.

'The Liberal Democrats have set up two inquiries into this issue. I think you have to let those inquiries take place and make sure, as I’ve said before, they get to the bottom of these very important allegations.'

His refusal to say he had full confidence in Mr Clegg comes after former Lib Dem activist Alison Smith said she would take her complaints about Lord Rennard to the police.

Scotland Yard has launched an investigation into the allegations.

Mr Cameron's remarks also follow revelations that Mr Clegg was warned a second senior Lib Dem figure had made unwanted advances to women but did nothing about it.

Mr Cameron is in Latvia for the Northern Future Forum which brings together prime ministers from Nordic and Baltic countries and Britain in Riga, Latvia.

Mr Clegg allegedly received a complaint in March 2011 about the behaviour of Mike Hancock, the MP for Portsmouth.

The complainant said Mr Hancock was a 'liability to women, the public and your party.'

Yet despite this, no investigation was ever held, according to The Spectator magazine.

The
letter was received months after Mr Hancock was arrested – but not 
charged – over allegations that he had made sexual advances on a 
constituent who had contacted him for help with a noisy neighbour.

The
alleged victim is now suing the MP over what she said was a ten-month 
inappropriate relationship, during which he is accused of placing his 
hand on her breast, exposing himself and kissing her without consent.

A
Lib Dem spokesman said last night: ‘If we’ve not replied to a letter, 
that’s not acceptable and we’ll look into why that happened. There was a
police investigation into Mike Hancock but no action was subsequently 
taken.

‘There is currently a civil claim being made and it’s not appropriate to comment further.’

Three years ago Mr Hancock hit the headlines when his 25-year-old researcher was arrested – accused of being a Russian spy.

The Lib Dems are already on the backfoot over claims that they ignored complaints from women of unwanted touching from the party's former chief executive Lord Rennard. He denies any wrongdoing.

When confronted over why he failed to act, Mr Clegg also took a swipe at the press, saying they should stop being 'self appointed detectives' and let the experts investigate.

His remarks backfired, however, with women complainants, saying he was blaming the free press while senior party figures had been sweeping the issue under the carpet for years.
