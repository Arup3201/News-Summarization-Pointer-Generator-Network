Junior Seau, an intimidating force on the football field who was also known for his extensive charity work, has been found dead in his home.

The former defensive player, whose career spanned 20 years, died of an apparent suicide in Oceanside, California.  He was 43.

Police said that Seau shot himself in the chest.

His death was first reported by TMZ.com.

Oceanside Police Chief Frank McCoy says Seau's girlfriend reported finding him unconscious with a gunshot wound to the chest Wednesday. McCoy says lifesaving efforts were unsuccessful.

Dozens of people were seen gathering outside Seau's home as news of his death spread.

Families showed up with flowers and fans wearing Chargers jerseys waited to hear more news.

At one point, his anguished mother Luisa Seau came outside to speak to reporters and fans.

With tears streaming down her face, she cried: 'Take me, not my son - but it is too late... I don't understand ... I'm shocked.'

The NFL has reached a $765 million settlement in August over concussion-related brain injuries among its 18,000 retired players, agreeing to compensate victims, pay for medical exams and underwrite research. Plaintiffs included Junior Seau (pictured here with George W Bush), who suffered from CTE

Why Seau decided to take his own life is a mystery to those who new him best - especially his mother, who said that he gave her no indication of a problem when she spoke to him by phone earlier this week.

'He's joking to me, he called me "a homegirl,"' she said.

His ex-wife told U-T San Diego that he had texted her and each of their three children 'I love you' on Tuesday night.

Tiaina Baul 'Junior' Seau was born on January 19, 1969 in American Samoa. After his family moved to Oceanside, California, Seau excelled in both football and track and field at Oceanside High School.

Seau
 was a standout linebacker with the University of Southern California 
before he was drafted by the hometown San Diego Chargers, whom he led to the Super Bowl 
following the 1994 season.

Seau was drafted by the San Diego chargers in the first round in 1990.

After 20 seasons playing on the Chargers, the Miami Dolphins and the New England Patriots, he retired from the NFL in 2010.

This
 afternoon, the Chargers tweeted: 'We ask everyone to stop what they're 
doing and send their prayers to Junior and his family.'

Dolphins CEO Mike Dee said in a statement: 'Junior was a fierce competitor whose passion and work ethic lifted his teammates to greater heights.

'His enthusiasm for the game was 
infectious and he passed that on to everyone who was around him. He 
loved the game so much, and no one played with more sheer joy.'

The Patriots also issued a statement 
expressing grief over Seau's death, saying: 'This is a sad day for the 
entire Patriots organization, our coaches and his many Patriots 
teammates.'

He leaves behind three children that he had with ex-wife Gina Deboer, whom he divorced in 2002.

Months after his retirement, the ex-linebacker was arrested on suspicion of abusing his 
live-in girlfriend at their home in Oceanside in San Diego County.

Hours later, after being released from custody, the 41-year-old drove his car over the beach-side cliff in Carlsbad, California.

Officials said Seau's injuries from the car crash were not life-threatening.

There was no evidence of drugs or alcohol involved in the crash and Seau told authorities he fell asleep while driving.

He started the Junior Seau Foundation
 in 1992, which is dedicated to raising money for education and 
awareness campaigns for young people.

Support: Fans showed up to pay their respects at Seau's restaurant in Mission Valley, California, which was closed as news of his death spread

Seau is the eighth death among members of the 1994 AFC champion Chargers, which lost the Super Bowl that year to the San Francisco 49ers.

His death follows the suicide last year of former Chicago Bears player Dave Duerson, who also shot himself in the chest.

He amassed 1,524 tackles, 56 1/2 sacks and 18 interceptions in his career.

Anguish: Junior Seau's mother Luisa struggled to hold herself together as she spoke to family members, friends and supporters outside her son's home

'Twenty years, to be part of this kind 
of fraternity, to be able to go out and play the game that you love, and
 all the lessons and the friends and acquaintances which you meet along 
the way, you can't be in a better arena,' Seau said last August after 
the Chargers announced he would be inducted into the team's Hall of 
Fame.

Seau was the fifth pick overall in the 1990 draft out of Southern California, and stayed with the Charges until being traded to the Dolphins.

He came out of retirement a few times to play with the Patriots in search of a Super Bowl ring and was with the team when they lost to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl following the 2007 season, which ended New England's quest for a perfect season.

Seau was beloved in San Diego, where he created a foundation and had a popular restaurant that bore his name.

Louie Lieras, 54, of Oceanside was driving through the area when he saw a number of cars parked outside Seau's house.

Once Lieras heard the news about Seau's death, he went home and put on an old Chargers jersey with Seau's name on the back.

'I don't know how you could give this up. This was his backyard. He's never going to see it again,' said Lieras, gesturing toward the Pacific Ocean just yards from Seau's front door. 'I feel for the family and his children.'
