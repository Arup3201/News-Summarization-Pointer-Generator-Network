At first glance these images may appear commonplace, but in actual fact they are highly realistic sculptures made from a single piece of pine.

Artist Randall Rosenthal uses only Vermont white pine and acrylic paint to create these stunning designs, which look just like real-life objects.

From flimsy newsprint, toworn trading cards, translucent pieces of tape and even deteriorating cardboard boxes, Randall creates them all in his workshop.

What's even more impressive is that he doesn't work from a photograph or model, but instead creates each object as he goes, using only an image in his mind as a guide.

After graduating from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in the late 1960s Rosenthal opened his first exhibition of surrealist paintings, a direction he pursued until the late 80s.

His focus then shifted to architectural design and next into the realist sculptures he creates today.

This may look like a cardboard box full of money, but it is in fact a wooden carving by artist Randall Rosenthal

The New York born artist uses a single piece of Vermont white pine to make each of the sculptures

Randall creates each image by picturing it is his mind, rather than working for a real life object

He then uses acrylic paint in order to finish the highly realistic artwork by adding texture and detail

After the paint has dried Randall adds elastic bands, tape, and a parcel label to the outside of the box

While this may appear to be the start of a delicious dinner, it is in fact made entirely of painted wood

The first stage of any project is to use a chisel to carve out the basic design to be built on later

Randall then uses more precise tools to add detail and texture, including the impressive twisted elastic bands

These hard-wood structures are a far cry from the surrealist art Randall produced when he first left college

The finished product appears exactly like a box of old baseball trading cards

Hyper-realistic: In this model Randall has even painted the outline of the notes on the outside of this envelope to give it the appearance of being translucent

Randall uses his painting techniques to create sticky tape which seems transparent, as in this baseball album

Randall takes up to two weeks to create each work, using paint and a 'micron' pen with archival ink

Randall's work is so realistic that the crossword on the back of this newspaper was actually solved, by Randall, at his his coffee table

Randall has been making the artworks for two years, after switching from surrealist painting

Every single detail on these newspapers, from the pictures to the text, is hand painted by Randall

Randall says the key to getting things looking realistic is to start by making them looking bigger than they need to be, then slowly carving in more and more detail until they reach the proper size

'Undercutting' each paper, making it appear balanced on the paper underneath, is the key part of the process. After that nothing about the carving can be changed

Baseball, newspapers and money are all favourite subjects of Randall's

Randall's eye for fine print was tested to the extreme on this precise map. He says he often works for weeks on minute details which often nobody notices
