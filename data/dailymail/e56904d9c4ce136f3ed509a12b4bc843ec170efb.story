Well-known daredevil, Yevgeny 'Wizard' Ivanov, has just performed one of his most extreme stunts to date.

The adrenaline junkie jumped off of a 62-metre (203 feet) high cliff, on Mounta Alimov in Crimea, but this time he had attached the rope to his body through his skin.

By piercing the skin around his spine with black hooks, Ivanov was able to hold his bungee rope in place during the jump.  

A well-known daredevil attempted a 62-metre bungee jump in Crimea - but there was a major twist!

Instead of fastening the cord around his waist, Yevgney Ivanov attached it directly to his skin via hooks

As extreme as the jump may be, Ivanov is not the first to attempt such a stunt.

In fact, more than 200 of such jumps have been made across the world, according to the man.

However, his recent jump is allegedly the highest ever completed.

Ivanov pierced the skin around his spine to insert black hooks, which supported his weight as he flew

Ivanov is not the first man to attempt such a stunt - in fact, he claims there have been over 200 just like it

The bungee cord's ability to hold his weight is particularly impressive in the climate, which affects the skin

In the cold, human dermatology becomes thinner and more likely to lacerate - especially under pressure

Most impressive, however, was the bungee's ability to support his weight.

In the winter, the cold weather affects the human dermatology.

Skin becomes thinner and more likely to lacerate - especially when under the intense pressure caused by said hooks.
