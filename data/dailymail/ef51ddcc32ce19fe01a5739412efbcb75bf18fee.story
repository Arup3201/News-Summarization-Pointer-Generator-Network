A British journalist who was being held by Ukrainian soldiers has been released.

Graham Phillips, 35, tweeted to his 11,000 followers that he was 'ok' after being held for since Monday under armed guard and accused of being a Russian spy.

The freelance reporter, who has been working for pro-Krelmin television station Russia Today, was detained in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine, before being taken to the defence ministry in the capital.

Graham Phillips, 35, tweeted to his 11,000 followers that he had been released from custody early this morning after being held for 36 hours

Today the Nottingham-born blogger took to his Twitter page to let his followers know of his release, writing: 'I've just recently been released after being detained by Ukrainian authorities at #Mariupol yesterday. Was then transferred to Zaporozhye where I stayed the night, under armed guard.

'Removed by armed guard today, questioned thoroughly on my work for @RT_com.

'All my work in order, no charges, no deportation, no one laid a hand on me in anger, Ukrainian authorities treated me fairly. All ok.'

He also addressed speculation that he had been holding a gun when he was detained and wrote on the social networking site: 'As for comments I was "holding a firearm".  Was holding my Canon camera,filming, just like I always do. Tomorrow will see if files still there.'

Mr Phillips was detained at a checkpoint near Mariupol in eastern Ukraine on May 20 - he initially managed to make contact with colleagues.

In the first interview since his release he told RT.com he had been taking photographs when the situation escalated as he questioned the solider about the situation in Ukraine when he told them he worked for RT.

'They started phoning people and then I was detained. I had my things taken off of me and interrogated quite thoroughly.'

He
 said he was taken away late on Monday night, around 9 pm local time, 
after having spent 9 hours at the military checkpoint and he was 
transferred to Zaporozhye in a police van at 'gun point,' to an army 
base barracks.

He said Ukrainian authorities accused him of being a spy because he worked for Russian television.

'They
 were alright. I mean they fed me, they looked after me, but I was held 
at a gun point and that was quite dramatic,' he told RT.

He was released after being handed over to the consul of the British embassy in Kiev.

RT reported that according to the ministry’s press service, Mr Phillips was detained for 'filming facilities which are forbidden from being filmed.'

Yesterday the Foreign Office said government 
officials were in contact with Ukrainian authorities and 'stand 
ready' to provide consular assistance.

Nottingham-born Mr Phillips, who grew up in Scotland, has been blogging about Ukraine for several months.

In tweets posted before he was apprehended, he said he had secretly filmed at 
Mariupol's city morgue where 11 bodies of people killed in bloody 
clashes on May 9 were allegedly held.

On May 19, a Ukrainian activist group called for him to be detained and deported, Russia Today claim.

It came just weeks after one activist placed a $10,000 on Mr Phillips's head.

Meanwhile President Vladimir Putin called the detention of two Russian journalists in Ukraine unacceptable on Wednesday and suggested it highlighted wider questions about the legitimacy of political power in Ukraine.

The detention of the journalists, working for the pro-Kremlin Internet news outlet LifeNews, has added to tensions between Moscow and Kiev, which accuses Russia of destabilising Ukraine's Russian-speaking east ahead of a presidential vote on Sunday.

'It's absolutely unacceptable and of course the question arises over the legitimacy of all political procedures in Ukraine,' Putin said, speaking to journalists.

Before he was detained he claimed to have secretly filmed hidden dead bodies after a clash on May 9

Threats: He had been received threats for weeks from a Ukrainian activist group on Facebook

Ukraine's Defence Ministry said this week that soldiers had detained two unknown men who had identified themselves as journalists and were filming separatists.

Putin also dismissed as 'nonsense' an allegation from the ministry saying the two journalists had been carrying portable air defence systems.

Both Ukrainian and Russian media have traded accusations of lying during the conflict.

Ukraine has temporarily blocked Russian television channels pending a court decision over their legality, but separatists who seized a television tower in eastern Ukraine have turned Russian channels back on, including Life News.

The activist page shared a photo of Mr Phillips warning he is 'publishing the position of Ukrainian troops'

Pro-Russian separatists have also abducted a number of Ukrainian journalists, including Irma Krat who runs an online news outlet and Serhiy Lefter.

Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma, passed a statement calling on Kiev to release the journalists Marat Saychenko and Oleg Sidyakin.

'We will succeed in freeing our two journalists and guarantee the freedom of their activities in Ukraine, including during large upcoming internal political events in Ukraine - the presidential election,' said the Chairwoman of Russia's Upper House of Parliament Valentina Matvienko.
