Formula One’s governing body, the FIA, have confirmed that Nico Rosberg will not face a sanction for his crash with Lewis Hamilton in Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix.

Although Hamilton claimed that Rosberg told him in a post-race meeting that he ‘deliberately’ orchestrated the second-lap collision, Mercedes’ director Toto Wolff tried to play down the accusation afterwards. Rosberg, too, said it was a ‘racing incident’.

In light of the evidence, FIA spokesman Pierre Regent told Sportsmail: ‘The FIA will not intervene in this issue. Only a "new element" that would have appeared after the results became final could justify us opening an investigation. A comment alleged to have been made in an internal briefing and later denied by the team itself does not constitute such a "new element".’

With the FIA not prepared to investigate the incident, Rosberg will remain 29 points clear of Hamilton, who ultimately retired from the race as a result of the smash that initially punctured his tyre, while his Mercedes team-mate, Rosberg, came second behind Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo.

Wolff was keen to distance himself from an initial briefing from within Mercedes that Hamilton’s recollection of his meeting with Rosberg was ‘broadly correct’. Wolff said: ‘They agreed to disagree in a very heated discussion, but it wasn’t deliberately crashing. That is nonsense.

‘Nico felt he needed to hold his line. He needed to make a point. He thought it was for Lewis to leave him space, and that Lewis didn’t leave him space.

‘It was deliberately taking into account that if Lewis moved it could end up in a crash.’
