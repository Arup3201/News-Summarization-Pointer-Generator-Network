A Chinese man is extremely lucky to be alive after he was hit three times by speeding cars.

The shocking footage shows the man, named Li, on a busy main road late at night in Kunshan city in west China's Jiangsu province.

As he lingers in the centre of the road waiting for cars to pass so he can cross safely, Li is clipped by a passing van, sending him sprawling to the floor.

Then, as he lies stricken, a car ploughs into him at high speed. Sickeningly the wheels pass straight over the man. The driver appears not to notice.

Horrifying: The car slams into the pedestrian, rolling over his prone body

Pedestrians saw the injured man and went to help him, but as the good Samaritans signal for a car to stop, a second car rear ends it, sending the vehicle lurching forwards and into the prone Li.

Amazingly, it was reported that Li survived and is now recovering in hospital after sustaining several fractures in his leg and ribs.

Fatal road accidents are a serious problem in China, where the highway network and number of new drivers are expanding rapidly while traffic laws and safety are widely flouted.

The ministry of transport says the number of road deaths in China fell from 104,000 in 2003 to 60,000 in 2012, or from about 300 fatalities a day to less than 200.

A study published in 2011 by a group of Chinese and US researchers concluded, however, that the number of deadly accidents was two times higher than the police claimed.
