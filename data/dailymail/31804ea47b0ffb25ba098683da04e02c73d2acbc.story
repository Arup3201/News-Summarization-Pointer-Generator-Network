An FBI agent is being held on anti-terrorism charges in Pakistan after authorities found ammunition in his bag as he checked in for a domestic flight.

Jinnah International Airport security staff found 15 bullets and a magazine for a 9mm pistol in the agent's bag on Monday afternoon, as he tried to board a Pakistan International Airlines flight to Islamabad, Washington Post reported.

The FBI Miami Field Office agent, in Pakistan to train police officers, appeared in court on Tuesday and will be detained until at least Saturday as authorities investigate.

US officials said the agent made a mistake and didn't realize he was carrying ammunition in his bag. They requested that the agent's name be withheld.

Pakistan's anti-terrorism laws forbid ammunition or weapons from being carried on commercial flights.

US officials told Washington Post the agent was in Pakistan as part of a multi-agency effort to help the country investigate corruption.

The operative's father told the newspaper his son was scheduled to be in the South Asian nation for about three months for 'office-type work' with 'a non-FBI-type' entity.

Meghan Gregonis, a spokeswoman for the US Embassy in Islamabad, said US officials are working to resolve the matter.

'We are aware of the reports, and we are coordinating closely with Pakistani authorities on the matter,' Gregonis said.

A Pakistani Foreign Ministry told Washington Post that local officials are trying to gather more information about the agentâ€™s job in Pakistan.

NBC News reported that the American agent did not resist arrest in Karachi and was handed over to airport police for further investigation.

The high-profile arrest has dominated the national media conversation in Pakistan since officials first announced they had an FBI agent in custody.
