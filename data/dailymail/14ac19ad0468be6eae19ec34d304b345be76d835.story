Swansea have had an offer of £5.5million rejected for Stuttgart midfielder Alexandru Maxim.

The 24-year-old has steadily progressed for the Bundesliga side after moving to Germany two years ago.

Garry Monk’s side have also lodged a £4m bid with Norwich for Martin Olsson, who has asked to leave the Canaries this month.

Olsson, 26, joined Norwich in the Premier League back in 2013 and wants a return to the top flight.

Monk wants Olsson to act as defensive reinforcement given he could lose full back Neil Taylor before February.

Swansea are awaiting an improved offer for the Wales international from Alan Pardew’s Crystal Palace.
