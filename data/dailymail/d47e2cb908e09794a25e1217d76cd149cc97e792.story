The father of a teenager who killed herself after being bullied online says he is ‘disgusted’ after the playboy founders of the website linked to her suicide were pictured on a luxury trip to Switzerland.

Hannah Smith, 14, was found hanged last month after being bullied on ask.fm, and last week the social networking site was linked to the suicide of another teenager.

But Latvian brothers Ilja and Mark Terebin, who founded the multi-million-pound website in 2010, appeared a world away from the allegations of cyber-bullying as they holidayed with their glamorous girlfriends under the Alpine peaks.

Life of luxury: Mark Terebin was snapped holidaying in Switzerland paid for by profits from ask.fm, a website he runs with brother Ilja that has been linked to cyber bullying and the suicide of Hannah Smith

Relaxation: Pictures have been posted online of Ilya Terebin with girlfriend Anna Kazakova enjoying their holiday

Glamourous: Mark's girlfriend Natasha has joined the brothers on their luxury trip paid for by their profits

In a series of photographs, Ilja, 34, and 29-year-old Mark are seen showcasing their champagne lifestyle during their stay at the five-star Schweizerhof hotel in Lucerne.

The photographs were posted on Instagram by Ilya’s girlfriend  Anna Kazakova, 28, who joined the brothers and Mark’s girlfriend Natasha Dovgjalo on the trip.

Last night, Hannah Smith’s father David condemned the pictures as ‘insensitive and disgusting’.

‘They are going round shamelessly living the high life while I’ve lost my daughter and had to sell my home,’ he said.

‘They have blood on their hands but they couldn’t care less. This is money they made on a site that killed my daughter,  Hannah, so I don’t know how they can live with themselves.’

Mr Smith, a lorry driver, explained why he sold the family home in Leicestershire at a loss of £20,000.

‘Hannah’s sister Joanna and I couldn’t be in that house any more. Joanna was the one who found  Hannah and she couldn’t go back upstairs after that, so we had no choice but to sell.’

Last week, friends of 14-year-old Izzy Dix, who was found hanged at her home in Devon on September 17, blamed bullying on ask.fm for her death and vowed to fight to have the site shut down.

Attack: Oleg Terebin demanded people 'stop spreading rumours' about his sons' website ask.fm

But speaking last week, the tycoons’ father Oleg said it was ‘nonsense’ to blame ask.fm or his sons.

‘Stop spreading these rumours,’ he added. ‘Are you saying this girl didn’t communicate with anyone else – teachers, parents, and friends?’ 

Asked whether his sons should do more to prevent bullying on the site, he snapped: ‘I don’t know what you are talking about.’

Ask.fm initially offered to name the trolls who bullied Hannah Smith. It has also said it is improving security.

But a source at the site, which makes £5 million a year in advertising revenue, later claimed that she sent most of the abuse to herself.

Yesterday, an ask.fm spokesman said: ‘The brothers did attend, along with several hundred other people, the wedding of a good friend in Switzerland.

'It would have been impolite not to join in toasts to the happy couple. We hope Mr Smith understands this, given the circumstances.’
