A Miami man is facing five years in prison and up to $10,000 fine for animal cruelty after allegedly beating a four-month old Beagle so severely that the puppy was dead just one day after he adopted her

Matthew Milewski, a high-frequency trader, adopted the puppy, Molly, from a Arkansas breeder Outback Beagles, who call their dogs 'friendly and loveable, with tail perpetually wagging!'

But just one day after getting his new best friend, Milewski had allegedly whipped Molly with a leash, slammed her against hard surfaces, and drug her across parking lots until she was bleeding.

Puppy: Molly the Beagle was only four months old when she was sent to Milewski last year. She was dead after just one day

American Airlines records show Milewski picked up Molly at 3:14 p.m. on Nov. 11, 2011.

Inside the box there was a note from the breeder: 'I hope that she brings as much joy to you and your family as our dogs have brought us. I wish her a long life of happiness and contentment.'

He later told police that he didn't care for her coat and considered returning 'it' but that he instead took her to the apartment he shared with his boyfriend and another beagle, Macy.

He put an electric-shock collar and 
leash on the new puppy the next day and began to walk her through the 
building's parking lot.

Carlos Gregorio, a valet parker in 
the building, told police he he heard a 'loud scream from a dog' just as
he was bringing a car from the garage.

At first he thought he'd hit an animal and jumped out of the vehicle.

Man's best friend: Outback Beagles describes their dogs as friendly, easygoing, and constantly wagging their tails

Then he saw Milewski, 'striking his dog with leash.'

Milewski was arrested in November 2011.

He told police the dog likely died from injuries sustained when he dropped her in the shower.

'I don't think I did anything wrong, other than the outcome was very poor because of the way the dog landed,' he told investigators. 'This was 100 percent an accident.'

Milewski's lawyer, David Macey, told the Miami Herald that 'there are some things that have not come to light yet.'

'You can't dispute there are injuries,' he said. 'How they occurred, whether or not it was a criminal act, is the question.'

Macey is an expert in high-profile animal abuse cases, having represented 19-year-old Tyler Hayes Weinman when the teen was accused of killing 19 cats in South Miami-Dade in 2009.

Prosecutors dropped the charges in that case after a defense expert determined that a large animal killed some of the cats, and Weinman is now suing several parties involved in the case.

Discipline: Mathew Milewski claims he as only trying to discipline his new Beagle because dogs wouldn't become obedient with 'rainbows and sugarplums'

Milewski denied the charges, claiming he was only trying to train the dog and following the instructions for the shock-collar manual.

'Dogs don't become extremely obedient with rainbows and sugarplums,' he said, admitting  that it may have appeared 'abusive' to onlookers who didn't know what he was doing, and that he'd been trying to train Molly in a 'very aggressive' way.

Outback Beagles disagrees, noting on their website under training information that for Molly's particular breed: 'Praise is the key, as they thrive on positive attention.'

Milewski told investigators he wanted to clean Molly after he noticed one of her paws was bleeding.

'When I went to put the dog underneath the shower head, it didn't like that at all and it bit me,' he said. 'I was very shocked. I don't like blood. When the dog bit me, a lot of blood came out and I overreacted to the dog doing this.'

Exactly how he reacted is unclear.

In one interview with investigators he describe it as having 'pushed' the dog in the shower, but in another he said he'd told the Alton Road Animal Hospital veterinarian that 'the way I threw the dog was definitely bad.'

Milewski said he attempted to give the Molly first aid once she was on the shower floor.

'From there it was, I guess you can call it, unconscious, so I gave it CPR,' he said. 'I tried to stand the dog up. I blew in the dog. I covered its beak [sic], the dog’s belly puffed up. I thought it was going to blow up, then it s---.'

Finally after calling a friend who advised him to take her to the vet, Milewski brought Molly to the Alton Road Animal Hospital.

There Dr. Heidi Foster tried to stabilize Molly and keep her 'alive and comfortable,’ according to her police statement.

Because the Alton Road X-ray machine was broken Milewski was directed to a clinic in Coral Gables. He put Molly in a pet carrier, belted it into the passenger seat of his BMW and left.

Loveable: Though Milewski claimed he had to be rough with Molly to train her, the breeder's website said Beagles respond be to positive reinforcement

Mystery: Milewski's attorney David Macey argues that all the facts in the case haven't come out, and that Molly's injuries were not the product of abuse

Foster told police that when she last saw Molly the dog was unconscious but her heartbeat was strong and steady.

'20 minutes late I got a call [from Milewski] that the dog's heart had stopped beating in the car,' Foster told police. 'I found it odd just due to the face that [Molly's] heart rate was so fast and strong and the vitals were fine.'

Milewski came back with Molly's corpse. Foster put it in the freezer.

The next day Charry called the police.

Dr. Rosandra Manduca, a veterinary pathologist and adjunct professor at Miami Dade College, was recruited by Animal Services to perform a necropsy.

She concluded death was 'likely due to a brain injury secondary to head trauma.'

Molly's injuries pointed to having been shaken and slammed against a hard surface, and their was bruising around her mouth, indicating that she may have been smothered.

Accusations are already being made that Milewski may have abused other animals.

Stacey Laneve, assistant property manager in Milewski's apartment building, said that a month before Molly's death she saw his dog Macy shaking.

'I went closer and noticed hemorrhaging in her eyes,' she said. 'I freaked out. To me that's a bad sign.'

Animal services has since confiscated Macy and returned her to her registered owner, Milewski's ex-boyfriend, who has not been named in police reports.

Laneve said she sent Milewski a text message one day after Molly's death.

'It think there's more to this story,' she wrote.

'Do you think I'd kill a dog I just paid $1,300 for?' he allegedly responded. 'I would have sold it.'
