It took 56 hours to complete, was made from 4,640 chocolate sticks and 10kg of Belgian chocolate, measures 120cm by 120cm and contains a whopping 143,840 calories - but this edible labyrinth will only take a few hours to eat.

The maze is the brainchild of YouTube vlogger Doug Armstrong, from London, and food artist Prudence Staite, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, who created their chocolate warren in homage to the Maze Runner film.

Mr Armstrong, 23, a self-confessed Maze Runner super-fan approached Midlands artist Ms Staite to create the epic construction early this year.

Ms Staite constructed the maze over a week's period with 4,640 chocolate sticks and 10kg of Belgian chocolate.

“Making the replica maze has taken a whole week of hard graft at my studio in Gloucestershire. Doug’s been a great help with all the intricate details and matching the maze up to mimic the one in the film,’ she said to FEMAIL. 

‘It’s been tricky - and somewhat sticky - work but I’m thrilled with how the chocolate maze has turned out,' said Mr Armstrong. 

'After I had the idea I started to figure out if I could do it myself then realised it would be impossible,' he continued. 

He then got in touch with experienced food artist Ms Staite to realise his chocolate vision.  

'I was involved in the creation; Prudence taught me some of her techniques,' he said. 

'I wanted to make sure I was a big part of it and helped out by sticking the chocolate fingers together.

'I’m a massive fan of The Maze Runner, and of all things food, so it’s been a great experience,' he continued. 

The London-based YouTube sensation has over 130,000 subscribers on his account where his videos include cheesecake and brownie recipes, food challenges and parodies of popular culture.   

As unusual as the chocolate maze is, it isn't Ms Staite's first quirky commission. 

'I have made all sorts of creations, including life-size chocolate rooms with solid chocolate fireplaces, lickable wall paper, and chocolate skirting boards, a walk-in wardrobe made entirely from chocolate in Australia, a life size sofa, and even replicas of people made in chocolate,' she explained. 

'I want art to be interactive and edible. I have worked with food as an art form for over 10 years and use all types of food too, such as cheese, pizza, bread, sugar, fruits and vegetables,' she continued. 

Ms Staite has used pizza dough to make a sculptures of Pope Benedict XVI and Rome’s Colosseum and has recreated classic artworks by Banksy, Andy Warhol and Seurat using Smarties. She made a pizza portrait of Wayne Rooney and built a likeness of Anne Robinson using biscuits.

Her savoury constructions include famous landscapes including Loch Ness, Big Ben, the Angel of the North and Stonehenge created from chips and mushy peas.

The pair’s collaboration came about to celebrate the 9 February release of The Maze Runner film on Digital HD, and on Blu-ray and DVD.

The edible maze directly mimics the dimensions of the maze model used in the film.

The Maze Runner starts stars Dylan O’Brien and Kaye Scodelario who play teenagers in a gang trying to navigate their way out of an obstacle-filled ever-changing maze they find themselves dumped in.
