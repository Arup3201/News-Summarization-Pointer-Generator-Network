Burnley held Manchester United to a 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Saturday as Louis van Gaal awaits his first win in charge at Old Trafford.

Find out how the players fared in the Barclays Premier League contest.

BURNLEY 

TOM HEATON - 7

A big day for the former United keeper and he will remember it. Good handling a super first half stop from Van Persie.

KIERAN TRIPPIER - 6.5

Didn’t get forward as much as may have hoped but never looked out of place against United’s attacking stars.

JASON SHACKELL - 8

A terrific performance from the Burnley captain. Led by example. Authoritative all afternoon.

Triple team: Burnley trio Jason Shackell, Kieran Trippier and Dean Marney challenge Juan Mata

MICHAEL DUFF - 7

Central defensive partnerships are very important and Duff played his part in this one.

BEN MEE - 6

Didn’t always look comfortable in possession and was happy to take the easy option. Solid enough, though.

SCOTT ARFIELD - 6

Couldn’t repeat his spectacular effort against Chelsea but showed the other side of his game here. Never stopped running.

Race:  Scott Arfield chases down Manchester United midfielder Ashley Young

DAVID JONES - 7

Struck a terrific early free-kick against the bar and looked persistently dangerous.

DEAN MARNEY - 6.5

Had a better afternoon as the game continued and worked hard to stifle some of United’s midfield players

MATTHEW TAYLOR - 6

His experience will be important this season but didn’t have his best afternoon.

DANNY INGS - 5.5

Came out of the Championship with a big reputation but hasn’t lived up to it yet. Looked one-paced here.

Struggle: Danny Ings once again failed to make an impact for Burnley and was hardly given a sniff

LUKAS JUTKIEWICZ - 6

The better of Burnley’s two forwards, he may have done more with an early chance than shoot against De Gea’s legs.

Subs: Barnes 6.5, Reid 6

MANCHESTER UNITED

DAVID DE GEA - 7.5

Always looks solid these days and once again did what he had to do without fuss.

PHIL JONES - 6

Did little wrong but needs to be more commanding and realise that he becoming a senior player.

Up in the air: Phil Jones put in a solid performance at the back as Manchester United kept a clean sheet

JONNY EVANS - 6

United always look better when he is in the team and showed signs he is growing in to the season

TYLER BLACKETT - 5.5

It’s been a hard baptism for the young defender this season. Looks short of confidence when in possession.

Development: Youngster Tyler Blackett started in defence once again for Manchester United

ANTONIO VALENCIA - 5.5

No reason why he can’t be an efficient wing-back but needs to concentrate better. Gave the ball away in dangerous positions.

DARREN FLETCHER - 6

Looks a real athlete again and did his job simply and efficiently here. Good to see him back at this level.

JUAN MATA - 5.5

He could be the long-term casualty of Di Maria’s arrival if he doesn’t raise his game. Fell over a good chance.

Below par: Juan Mata could be the long-term casualty of Angel di Maria's arrival if he doesn't raise his game

ASHLEY YOUNG - 6

Looks a better wing-back than many thought he could be. Could have had a penalty in the first half.

ANGEL DI MARIA - 7

A really promising debut from the record signing. Lovely ball for Van Persie chance in first half.

Debut: £60m signing Angel di Maria lasted just over an hour in his first game for United

WAYNE ROONEY - 6

Worked hard as always but lacking inspiration. Never troubled the Burnley goalkeeper.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE - 6.5

Looked sharper than last week and struck his first half chance well. Relationship with Rooney needs work.

Subs: Anderson 6, Januzaj 6, Welbeck 6.5 

Withdrawn: Robin van Persie started at Turf Moor but was replaced by Danny Welbeck later in the game
