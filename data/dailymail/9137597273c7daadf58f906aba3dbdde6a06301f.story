From a distance, they could be mistaken for sheep - but these cute bundles of wool are in fact pigs.

The Mangalitsa is a rare breed of pig which inhabits only a few farms in the UK - living in woodland, farms and even on occasion in homes as they are easily house trained.

Malcolm Gough and his wife Lesley bought a small farm in Oakham, Rutland four years ago and they immediately fell in love with the unusual pig.

I'm not a sheep! Under that woolly coat, the rare Mangalitsa pig has a snout, curly tail and trotters

Mr Gough, 60, said: 'Lesley bought us a place on a pig-keeping course where we were introduced to many of the native rare breeds of pig.

'They had Mangalitsa and we couldn't quite get over how they looked - more like sheep than pigs.

'We decided there and then we just had to have some.'

The couple have become breeders of the pig - with most of their offspring being sold to people who also want to breed them.

This is all in aid of the Mangalitsa surviving, however, as on most farms, the pigs end up on the dinner table too.

Last year, the Goughs had more than 60 sheep pigs on their farm and although they try not to grow too attached, Mr Gough admitted it can be hard.

He said: 'We promised ourselves not to name any pigs as we knew that occasionally some would have to go to the butcher, but we haven't managed to do that.

'The pigs are much more intelligent than people appreciate so it's hard not to build a relationship with them.

'As Churchill said, "Cats look down on you, dogs look up to you, but pigs look you straight in the eye!"

'All pigs love to have their tummies stroked, but the Mangalitsas especially so. They are also escapologists, which worried us at the start when we would get calls from all over Rutland telling us where our pigs were out for a stroll.'

Mangalitsa pigs are much hardier than normal pigs and moult in the summer to prevent them getting too hot

The sheep-pig used to be a common sight in Lincolnshire and was shorn once a year to make sweaters, but it became extinct in Britain in 1972.

In the early 1900s, many Lincolnshire curly coats were sold to Austria and Hungary where they were crossed with the Mangalitsa, creating the Lincolista.

Three years ago, this cross-breed were found thriving in Austria and a small number were brought back to create a herd in Britain.

They are worth around £1,000, five times the value of an ordinary pig and are fond of fruit and the odd tipple.

Mangalitsa pigs are much hardier than normal pigs and moult in the summer to prevent them getting too hot.

Unlike normal commercial pigs, they do not get sunburnt.

Hair from the pigs is particularly popular in the U.S. as it retains air bubbles under water, making it ideal for tying fishing flies.

They come in three colours, bright red, blonde and black with a cream stomach and they are lardier than most breeds, making them perfect for Parma ham-style cuts.
