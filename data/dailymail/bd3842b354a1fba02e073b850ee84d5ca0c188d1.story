Yankees star third baseman Alex Rodriguez reportedly tried to purchase documents from a Miami clinic in order to keep them from officials in Major League Baseball, it was revealed today.

Rodriguez, who is likely out until the midpoint of the 2013 season, had an intermediary purchase the papers from the Biogenesis clinic in Miami.

After officials in the MLB front office learned of this deal, they rushed to buy copies of the documents as well, which purport to show ties to performance-enhancing drugs.

Rodriguez's purchase was first reported by the New York Times.

The New Times said it obtained records detailing purchases by Rodriguez, 2012 All-Star game MVP Melky Cabrera, 2005 AL Cy Young Award winner Bartolo Colon and 2011 AL championship series MVP Nelson Cruz.

Its exposé claimed the baseball star received cocktails including Human Growth Hormones (HGH) and testosterone creams on a fairly regular basis, according to handwritten notes viewed by someone familiar with the clinic.

Rodriguez's name appears in handwritten notes, reportedly kept by Bosch's clinic, that indicate he received various substances from 2009 up until 2012.

'There was his name, over and over again, logged as either 'Alex Rodriguez', 'Alex Rod', or his nickname at the clinic, 'Cacique,' a pre-Columbian Caribbean chief. Rodriguez’s name appears 16 times throughout,' according to the article.

Rodriguez has denied the claims.

Other baseball players the newspaper said appeared in the records include Gio Gonzalez and Yasmani Grandal.

Later, Yahoo Sports reported that 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun's name also appeared in the records.

Braun subsequently issued a statement
saying: 'I have nothing to hide.' He has said his name appeared because
of an issue over payment for consultancy work relating to his 
successful fight to overturn a 2011 doping ban.

Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig has declined to comment on Biogenesis, other than to say it is the subject of a 'very thorough investigation' by MLB.

Lawsuit: Anthony Bosch faces a claim for unspecified damages after he was accused of doling out banned substances at his Miami clinic

The Times said the payments by the commissioner's office did not exceed more than 'several thousand dollars.'

MLB officials decided to take the unusual step of paying for the documents because, with no subpoena power, its investigators would likely have no access to the material if it wound up in the players' hands, the paper reported.

Last month, Major League Baseball sued Biogenesis, and its operators, accusing them of scheming to provide banned performance-enhancing drugs to players in violation of their contracts.

The lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks unspecified damages from Biogenesis and its operator, Anthony Bosch.

Several other Bosch associates are named in the lawsuit.

Among the banned drugs supplied, the lawsuit said, are testosterone, human growth hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin.

Baseball officials also unsuccessfully lobbied New Times editors to share the documents that formed the basis of their story.
