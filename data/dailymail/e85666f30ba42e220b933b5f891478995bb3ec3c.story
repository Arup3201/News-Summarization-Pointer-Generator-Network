Quick! Somebody fetch the nachos.

Well. Make that several bags of nachos. Meet the Avozilla –  a monster avocado that is  five times heavier than its rather more modestly proportioned cousin.

At 3lb, it could make enough guacamole to feed an army. Or at least a very hungry family.

Super-sized: Tesco buyer Emma Bonny shows how large an avozilla is compared to a standard avocado

And once you have scooped out the flesh, the extra thick skin can be used as a bowl for all that dip.

The Avozilla is grown only on  trees belonging to one of the world’s biggest suppliers of  avocados in South Africa.

The fruit is double the length and five times the weight of the standard variety, measuring seven-and-a-half inches.

It goes on sale today at Tesco, for £3.

The supermarket’s salad buyer, Emma 
Bonny, said: ‘The Avozilla has a fantastic taste with a rich, juicy, 
buttery texture, and creamy flavour.

Feed the family: The avozilla costs £3 and dwarves this egg and standard avocado

The avozilla is almost five inches long and weighs about 1.3 kilograms on average and will go on sale for £3

‘The ripe fruit is an attractive 
vivid green colour – different from the darker-coloured smaller variety –
 and its thick skin can actually be used as a serving bowl for 
guacamole.

‘Avocados are full of nutrients and 
vitamins, and by stocking these big varieties, we’re making it easier 
than ever before for our customers to eat healthily.

‘We believe the Avozilla will appeal to shoppers who are looking for value for money, but especially large families.’

Once a comparatively niche food, 
avocados have become an everyday shopping basket favourite. She 
explained: ‘Avocados are one of our fastest-growing areas in produce, 
with a staggering 30 per cent growth so far this year.’

Deputy Femail Editor Toni Jones taste-tested the giant fruit at a summer barbeque in Sydenham. She said: 'I surprised my foodie friends with the monster fruit and, after over-analysing the possible calorie content, we all decided that he is a must-have BBQ accessory. Easy to prepare and very creamy the avozilla made a mean guacamole, enough to serve six, and tasted great served with lots of prosecco.'

Hitting the UK: The rare giant fruit is grown in South Africa and will go on sale in Tesco from this weekend

Ingredients

•    3 spring onions

•    1 large tomato

•    1 avozilla

•    2tbsp crème fraîche

Method

Finely chop the spring onions. De-seed the tomato and chop into small pieces. Puree the avozilla, this is best done by forcing it through a fine metal sieve. Stir the crème fraîche into the avozilla then fold in the chopped tomatoes and spring onions. Serve with corn chips or, for a healthy option, with carrots, cucumber or crudités or spooned into little gem lettuce leaves.
