The video of a NYPD officer appearing to racially profile two Muslim men because they are wearing traditional Islamic clothes has been exposed as a hoax.

Shamelessly seeking to exploit recent tensions sparked in New York City by the choking death of Eric Garner in July, the video was created by two filmmakers hoping to create and profit from viral content on YouTube.

Brooklyn residents Adam Saleh and Sheikh Akbar, who produce shareable content under the name 'TrueStoryASA' released the video entitled, 'Racial Profiling Experiment' over the weekend - duping many media outlets around the world.

Fight: Adam Saleh and Sheikh Akbar begin brawling on the street while what appears to be an NYPD officer with his face blurred just watches

However, some were not quite so eager to throw yet more allegations of racism at New York's Finest and quickly realized that despite being viewed more than 140,000 times, the video was fake.

TrueStoryASA boasts more than 60 million YouTube views and they count more than 661,000 subscribers on the video sharing site - raking in tens of thousands of dollars from advertizing revenue from commericials that play before their content.

They generally post comedy videos and prank the public and in the 'Racial Profiling Experiment' the scene opens with Saleh and Akbar arguing loudly in the street.

They are wearing jeans and T-shirts and push and shove each other and look like they are about to exchange punches.

All the while, just visible in the frame is a what appears to be a NYPD officer, with his face blurred, standing, passively watching.

Hoax: Adam Saleh and Sheikh Akbar appear to be immediately approached by the same officer 20 minutes later wearing Islamic clothes according to their debunked video

The argument was staged, the video gives the impression the police officer is real and was filmed by a friend in a parked car.

The video then claims to jump forward 20 minutes and sees Saleh and Akbar wearing traditional Islamic garb.

They describe these garments as their 'cultural clothes.'

Quickly, they begin arguing again, but this time the cop, with his face still blurred approaches them immediately, asking, 'What’s all the arguing about? Why are you dressed like this?'

The officer then rams Saleh against the wall and frisks him and demands, 'What is this? What’s in your pocket?'

It is his phone, but the officer yells, 'Is this a gun? Is that a knife?'

The officer does not seem to remove the item nor appear concerned that Akbar is standing near to him.

Friends: The two are from Brooklyn and run their viral YouTube video content channel TrueStory ASA

Humor: They usually make comedic videos that pole fun at social issues - the purported NYPD hoax is a departure for them

The two then make their 'reveal' and tell the cop they were the same guys arguing 20 minutes before and that he has been caught out racially profiling them.

The now chastened officer seems to want to leave the scene and then the video ends with a request for a thumbs up and to subsribe to their YouTube channel.

The Smoking Gun showed the clip to a NYPD source who works at the 110th precinct nearby to the Queens neighborhood where the clip was filmed.

He said that an officer would never be standing idly on a deserted street corner and said his uniform and utility belt were incorrect.

He also questioned the officer's frisking.

'That’s not how they teach you in the academy,' he told The Smoking Gun and also poured scorn on the idea that an officer would ask a Muslim man why he was dressed in a certain way.

A second source told The Smoking Gun that this was an 'obvious hoax' designed to 'smear the police'.

Saleh and Akbar have been sent messages asking to respond, but have not yet done so.
