A Seattle mother-of-two has taken on an unusual New Year's resolution - to eat and drink in Starbucks for the rest of the year.

From espressos and mochas to the last few eggnog lattes being sold at the coffee chain's 18,000 stores worldwide, Beautiful Existence (her legal name) is planning to eat and drink at Starbucks alone for the whole of 2013.

'We're really lucky and I would say actually spoiled as Americans because we have all these different eating options,' she told MyNorthWest.com.

'You go to all these other countries and they don't have these luxuries.
Really? Is it really going to be that hard for one year of my life to 
limit my menu? We'll find out.'

Writing on her blog she says she is inspired by the likes of Morgan Spurlock and Jared - the Subway guy - but is frustrated women aren't taking on such food challenges.

'Life is curious… Life is unique… Life is about asking questions, no matter how small, silly or profound so that you can find out what is TRUE for YOU and sometimes see if its true for others as well,' she writes.

'So how can eating only one company’s products impact me, anybody? Well Mr. McDonald’s already proved that question years ago with his documentary and Mr. Subway did his take on the loosing [sic] weight portion of the food challenges too. But when I watched those guys doing their thing I asked myself 'where are the WOMEN challenging themselves in the world?''.

Starbucks need not worry. Ms Existence is a big fan of the chain and says she wants to promote the store.

'I wanted to help show others what I already knew from family and friend
partners (Starbucks code for staff) about all the environmental and 
job-creation/job-benefits and community building this local company does,' she writes.

It isn't the first time she has taken on a year-long endeavor. In 2011 she blogged about only buying her belongings in Goodwill stores.

One thing making her challenge slightly less burdensome this time around is she's allowing herself Tazo tea and Evolution Fresh products too - given they are owned by Starbucks.

Day 1: Fresh orange juice, Starbucks Refresher drink, turkey and swiss sandwich, ham and swiss panini

Day 2: Simply nuts and fruit, Evolution Fresh - Kevin's quinoa, kale and squash bowl

Day 3: Southwest scramble and Crystal's black beans and greens, turkey rustico pannini

Day 4: Turkey rustico panini, roasted tomato and mozzarella panini, latte, banana, garden veggies bistro box, Starbucks caramel macchiato ice cream

Day 5: Hard boiled eggs, Ancho chilli chicken wrap, Tazo tea - ginger infused sugar

And Starbucks products are now sold in so many supermarkets she isn't confined to official coffee houses alone.

She says she is using information on packaging to ensure she gets the nutrition she needs and won't put on weight because of the challenge.

'I’ve been going in and getting their nutrition by the cup charts for all their serving sizes', she told the local news website.

'I’m already getting a feel for what 
to eat — the plain nut pack as a snack because it only has 190 calories,
compared to the piece of pumpkin bread.

'I'm still trying to figure out how I can do sushi. I have 
two friends who are chefs and I want to see if I can get them to help me
tear down some of the products at Evolution fresh and do something 
else.'

Aside from the obvious limitations of eating only in a coffee shop the project is also quite expensive.

Despite
donations of Starbucks goods from fans of the blog, Ms Existence is 
averaging $18.79 a day, but even that isn't putting her off.

Chain reaction: Starbucks has been the object of many bloggers interest. Seattle mother Beautiful Existence is a big fan so won't be causing any headaches with her challenge to just eat there in 2013

'The company pays good benefits for part-time workers,' she explains. 'That’s where my money is going.'

And so far she has only fallen off the wagon once - when baking cakes for her two sons.

'I will admit to you all right now that I did indeed lick the batter-covered spoon, initially it happened out of bad habit… but it happened,' she wrote on the blog.

'I guess you can say that this was my first “Oops” moment of this year of eating/drinking only  Starbucks.'

A New York blogger, John McCourt, is currently undertaking a challenge to visit all 201 Starbucks stores in Manhattan.

Last year, Christine Hall, 66, from Virginia, claimed she lost 85 pounds by going on a Starbucks diet.
