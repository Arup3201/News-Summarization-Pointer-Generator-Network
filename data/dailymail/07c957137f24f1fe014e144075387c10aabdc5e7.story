If bubbles start to appear in your non-sparkling wine and it whiffs of wet dog or cabbage, then it's time you tipped it down the sink. 

And if you have no room in your fridge to chill a bottle of white, then simply wrap a wet towel around it and pop it in the freezer for five minutes. 

From tricks such as opening a wine bottle without a corkscrew to simple recipes for wine desserts, the infographic details useful and practical tips to make your vino last longer.

These are some of the 12 useful tips are revealed in an infographic by Nottingham-based kitchen appliance retailer Appliance City.  

Advice also includes making cheap wine taste expensive by aerating it in a blender for half a minute, and how to make your plonk last longer. 

The most useful tip is, of course, how to open a bottle of wine without a corkscrew - in six easy ways.

The first three involve a picture hook, a thick screw or a nail, all which have to be screwed into the cork and pulled out with pliers.

Or it suggests drilling a hole in the cork with a sharp object, then feeding through some string with a knot in the end before pulling.

The other methods involve pushing a key into the cork at a 45 degree angle or using a tube from a bike pump to make the cork rise.

The handy graphic also reveals how to make wine ice-cubes from left-over wine which can be used in cooking.

And those who relish a cold glass of Sauvignon Blanc but don't approve of ice-cubes in wine will appreciate the next hint.

Simply freeze some grapes then pop them into your glass the next time you fancy a truly chilled tipple. There's no fear of your wine being watered down. 

The guide also advises wine fans to 'blend'  cheap wine in a blender for 30 seconds to make it taste more expensive.

Fancy a Bellini but run out of sparkling wine and fresh fruit? Simply mix equal parts white wine, sparkling water and fruit juice for a quick-fix solution. 

No room in your freezer? Then chill wine in five minutes by adding a big handful of salt to a bucket of icy water. 

And if you want to cool your bottle down quickly simply wrap it in a wet towel and freeze.

To tell if your wine has gone off, simply take a good sniff of your glass. If the vino smells like wet dog, cardboard, a farmyard, vinegar, burnt rubber, or cooked cabbage, then you will need to tip it down the sink.

The same goes when it looks browner than usual or if bubbles appear in a non-sparkling wine.
