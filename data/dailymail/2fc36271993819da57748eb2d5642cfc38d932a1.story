The designer behind the Tower of London poppy exhibition has revealed he was disturbed by the 'frenetic, obsessive surge of emotionalism' that the commemorative installation created.

Tom Piper was awarded an MBE in the New Year Honour's List in recognition of his work on Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, the hugely popular display which attracted millions of visitors.

But the theatre designer admitted he was 'not comfortable' with the outpouring of emotion it triggered, saying he was 'perturbed' by the reaction.

Tom Piper, the designer behind Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, said he was 'perturbed' by the 'frenetic, obsessive surge of emotionalism' which the commemorative installation created 

He told The Independent: 'When it got to a point where it started to become a sort of pilgrimage, it felt familiar in a way that I was not comfortable with.

'There have been other moments when the British public has focused on something like that. [I was] slightly perturbed by the frenetic, obsessive surge of emotionalism that the installation invoked.'

An estimated five million visitors flocked to see the display, which was co-created with ceramicist Paul Cummins to mark the centenary of the star of the Great War. 

But, despite the praise heaped on the artwork, some criticised the duo for not being 'conventional artists', something which Mr Piper said made him 'livid'.

A row also broke out after The Guardian's art critic Jonathan Jones claimed it was 'toothless' and 'fake' and that the Tower's moat should instead be filled with 'barbed wire and bones'. 

Reacting to the review, Mr Piper said: 'The theatre designer in me would say: "Just because a play is about World War I you don't fill the stage with bones – that would be such a crass, clichéd thing to do". You find the metaphor and you allow people in.'

The hugely popular display, created to remember every British and Colonial death during the First World War, attracted millions of visitors

The exhibit saw 888,246 ceramic poppies gradually planted in the moat at the Tower, marking 100 years since the start of the Great War. 

The Prime Minister and royal family were among those who planted ceramic poppies as part of the exhibit.

In her Christmas message the Queen spoke of her own visit to see the poppies, saying: 'The only possible reaction to walking among them was silence.' 

The artist also hit back at comments made by The Guardian's art critic Jonathan Jones who suggested the moat should be filled with bones, by saying: 'That would be such a crass, clichéd thing to do'

The exhibit became so popular that national campaign was launched to extend it.

The leaders of all four main political parties demanded the display should be extended for an extra week - something which also made Mr Piper feel uncomfortable.

He said he 'didn't really like the fact' that various politicians started trying to take ownership of it.
