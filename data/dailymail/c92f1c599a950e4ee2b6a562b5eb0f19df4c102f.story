As if they are not blessed with enough good fortune, some of the world’s biggest stars have decided they need a Middle Eastern charm to bring them luck.

Actresses, singers and socialites have begun wearing bracelets and necklaces adorned with the ‘hamsa’ symbol, which is said to ward off bad spirits.

Protecting herself: Heidi Klum, 40, wears the coveted necklace. It is thought to fend off the bad luck caused by the 'evil eye'

Spiritual: Madonna made a statement with her oversized version of the pendant on a thick gold chain

Never ones to ignore a passing fad, 
Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna and Naomi Campbell were among the first 
celebrities to adopt the craze, and actress Jennifer Aniston is the 
latest.

The 44-year-old Friends star was seen wearing a hamsa necklace – which is believed to protect wearers from  the ‘evil eye’ – as she attended a party in New York.

Many cultures believe the evil eye is a look that can cause injury or bad luck for the person at whom it is directed. 

Trend: The Middle Eastern symbol has become a favourite among the world's most fortunate

Other celebrity fans of the symbol 
include Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh, who is planning her 
wedding to rapper Professor Green, and singers Rihanna and Britney 
Spears.

Miss Paltrow, who has already been 
criticised for promoting overpriced goods on her Goop lifestyle website,
advertises a £270 Sheryl Lowe hamsa bracelet.

The hand-shaped amulet has its roots in Muslim and Jewish societies and is commonly found on North African and Middle Eastern wall hangings.

Hamsas with the fingers spread are often hung above the door of a pregnant woman’s home to ward off bad spirits, but when the fingers are together, the hand is supposed to bring good luck.

It is just one of a number of jewellery trends followed to promote spiritual well-being.

Cherie Blair hung a ‘bioelectric shield’ pendant around her neck when her husband Tony was in office because she thought it would ‘ward off evil spirits and harmful rays’.
