Not content with posting your selfies on Facebook or Twitter? Well, now you can wear them for everyone to see.

Picattoo has launched a service which transforms Instagram photos into temporary inkings that can be worn wherever you like on your body.

The Netherlands-based service ships what it has dubbed ‘Insta-tats’ worldwide for free.

Heart on your sleeve: The new service uses a selection of your favourite Instagram photos to manufacture personalised temporary tattoos that last up to around seven days providing you don't scrub them

It was launched by photography products company Ink361, which monetises Instagram usage by offering a web viewer and print-your-photos service, among other products.

For £9.99 ($14.99), Picattoo offers 12 temporary tattoos created from a dozen Instagram photos of your choice.

According to its website, each tattoo lasts around seven days, providing it isn't scrubbed or picked at. 

Bringing your Instagram snaps from the screen into the real world is nothing new, however.

Twitter has officially launched its ‘while you were away’ summary feature.

The tool shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important, and that the user may have missed since they last logged in.

The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the site and are similar to the 'Top stories' prioritised on Facebook.

In a blog post detailing the changes, Product Manager, Paul Rosania wrote: 'Today we’re introducing something new to your home timeline: a recap of some of the top Tweets you might have missed from accounts you follow.'

'Our goal is to help you keep up - or catch up - with your world, no matter how much time you spend on Twitter. 

The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear - and the Twitter update is likely to cause similar frustrations.
