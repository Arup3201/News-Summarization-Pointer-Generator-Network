FA chairman Greg Dyke’s wide-ranging proposals to improve the future of the England team include going back in time to the days of a regionalised third tier of English football.

Dyke, who goes public with the findings of his England Commission at Wembley today, discussed his plan with Football League top brass at a dinner last night, having received FA board backing earlier in the day.

The central plank and most controversial of Dyke’s Commission recommendations is a new fourth tier of the English game featuring mainly B teams from the Premier League plus possible Conference club involvement as well as promotion and relegation.

Back to the future: Greg Dyke's latest plans are to regionalise lower leagues and introduce Premier League B teams

Dyke wants a full debate on the merits of the cash-strapped League One and League Two returning to the old Third Division North and South system which ran from 1921 to 1958.

Feedder clubs: Southampton would prefer to build an official alliance with a lower league side

The B team proposal has received strong support from the clubs — if not the PL administrators — with Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all very enthusiastic.

But Dyke will suggest an alternative for PL clubs who oppose a B-team league, by offering them an official alliance with a lower-tier side. Southampton favour this feeder option, although Football League fans might not be so enamoured.

Both the Football League and Conference have board meetings today at which Dyke’s recommendations will be at the top of the agenda.
