Scotland international Ruaridh Jackson could be out for the season after suffering a serious knee injury during Wasps' Aviva Premiership victory over Northampton last Sunday.

Wasps have announced that the 26-year-old has suffered an anterior cruciate ligament tear, will require surgery and is likely to be sidelined for between six and nine months.

Jackson, who has won 25 Scotland caps, joined Wasps from Glasgow this summer.

'We are all incredibly disappointed for Ruaridh, who has made such an impact since joining Wasps this season,' Wasps rugby director Dai Young said.

'He has impressed me during training, both with his skill level and his attitude, and it's a real blow to lose him after he played so well in pre-season and when he came on against Northampton last Sunday.

'Our medical team will be monitoring Ruaridh carefully and supporting him through this frustrating period.

'Professional sport is cruel at times, and this is certainly one of those times.

'Alex Lozowski will now have an opportunity to impress over the next few weeks, alongside Andy Goode, while we also have the option of playing Rob Miller at fly-half.'

Jackson made his Test debut against New Zealand in 2010. His most recent international appearances were against the USA and Canada during Scotland's summer tour three months ago.
