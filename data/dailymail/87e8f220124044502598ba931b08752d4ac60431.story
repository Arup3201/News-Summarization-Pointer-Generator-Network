Experts this week have warned the internet could be running out of space, but it could also be under a completely different threat - sharks.

Google protects its underwater data cables from shark bites with a hi-tech material, according to one of its employees.

The fibre optic cables are responsible for carrying the world’s internet traffic, and they are protected from knocks that could break the glass tubes, as well as from shark bites that could break the backbone of the internet.

Google protects its underwater data cables from shark bites by encasing them in super-strong Kevlar-like fibres, according to one of its employees. A stock image of a great white shark is shown

One of the search giant’s product managers told Network World that the firm uses a Kevlar-like material to provide extra cushioning for cables in the Pacific in order to protect them from shark bites.

Kevlar is a high-strength armoured synthetic fibre designed by DuPont, and it seems that Google uses its own equivalent.

It is thought that the creatures are so interested in the cables because of the magnetic field they create, which is similar to those made by fish in distress.

Sharks may chomp on the cables in the mistaken belief they are about to get an easy meal. 

Here, a shark attacks a fibre optic cable (not necessarily one of Google's) perhaps because it was attracted by the electric or magnetic field

The fibre optic cables (illustrated) are responsible for carrying the world’s internet traffic and while they are protected from knocks that could break the glass tubes, there is a risk that sharks could damage the backbone of the internet

Lasers are used in the fibre optic cables to send information through glass.

Data can be transmitted at speeds of up to one gigabit per second, which is around 100 times faster than copper connections, which appear to be unappealing to sharks.

The fibres are encased in plastic coatings in different colours, then wrapped in a protective layer of Kevlar-like material before being sheathed in a polyurethane jacket.

Not only does this provide cushioning from knocks and movement, the coating prevents electricity leaking and minimises electrical and magnetic fields emitted.

Google has not commented on the attacks, but experts claim it is likely other companies also take measures to protect their cables from apex predators.

Google's Faster project will connect Japan to the west coast of the US. The cable will stretch 5,000 miles (8,000km) under the ocean at depths of around 7,000 miles (11,300km) and will then link with local cable systems already in place. Faster is expected to be complete by Spring 2016

Google is investing further in the underground cable network by backing a project that will span the Pacific Ocean.

 Called Faster, the $300 million (£178 million) scheme will connect Japan to the west coast of the US.

The cable will stretch 5,000 miles (8,000km) under the ocean, and will then link up with local cable systems already in place. Faster is expected to be completed by Spring 2016.

On the Japan side, the cable will land at Chikura and Shima and is designed to improve the network further into Asia.

While on the US side, the cable will connect networks in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle.

‘At Google we want our products to be fast and reliable, and that requires a great network infrastructure, whether it's for the more than a billion Android users or developers building products on Google Cloud Platform,’ said Urs Hölze, senior vice president of technical infrastructure at Google.

‘And sometimes the fastest path requires going through an ocean.

'That’s why we’re investing in Faster, a new undersea cable that will connect major West Coast cities in the US to two coastal locations in Japan with a design capacity of 60 terabits per second.’

That’s ten million times faster than a household cable modem.

Google has previously invested in other cable projects, including Unity in 2008, which also joined Japan to the US, and the South-East Asia Japan Cable (SJC) in 2011.
