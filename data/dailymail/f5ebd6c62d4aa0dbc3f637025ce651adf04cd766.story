Owners of a Chico, California bagel shop received a shock last week when they discovered a tip of more than $43,000 while combing through receipts.

The college-tuition sized tip was received last Wednesday morning, just after 7am, but an employee didn't notice until the end of her shift. Brooklyn Bagel Works owners Peter Horylev and Scott Schulman quikcly called the card company to stop the charge, believing it was a mistake.

Schulman told MailOnline that he hasn't had contact with the customer, but heard the regular told a local reporter he only meant to tip 10 per cent.

Too good to be true: A customer of Brooklyn Bridge Bagel Works in Chico, California gave a $43,231.52 tip last week, but store owners believe it was a mistake

Generous: The California store recently started using a new tipping system which the owners believe may be to blame for the tipping mishap

When the owners called the card processing company, they were told not to worry, the charge likely wouldn't clear.

'But then when they were on the phone they checked and sure enough it had been authorized and had gone through,' co-owner Horylev told KHSL.

Horylev and his business partner then told the company to reverse the tip and just charge for the $8 order of a egg sandwich with a side of potatoes and coffee .

The owners still don't know how the tip was entered, but believe it may be the result of a new tipping system for car users.

Accident: The new tipping system involves customers pressing a  button for what percentage they would like to add. the co-owners of the bagel shop believe the customer accidentally pressed a button to enter a dollar amount and accidentally put in a seven-figure tip

No contact: Pictured above is co-owner Peter Horylev. He and his partner Scott Schulman has not yet made contact with the customer who gave the accidental tip

Instead of filling in a number on the receipt, customers are now asked to press a button on the card reader, denoting what tip percentage they would like to give.

But the options are only 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent.

The only way the customer would have been able to give such a hefty tip is by hitting another button which allows them to enter in a dollar amount.

'Somehow they just must have gotten befuddled and hit the button and thought they were done and just kept hitting buttons,' Horylev said.

Since starting the new tip process two months ago, Horylev says his customers have been a bit confused and the system sometimes times out.

But she says there hasn't been any issues with customers entering in the wrong amount.Â
