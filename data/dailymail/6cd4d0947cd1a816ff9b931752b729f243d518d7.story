A man and his mother starved, beat and chained an 11-year-old boy for several hours at a time at a home in southwestern Michigan, authorities charge.

Randall Hamilton, 28, and his mother, Peggy Hamilton, 46, are being held on $1 million bond after 
being arraigned Wednesday on charges of torture and first-degree child 
abuse in District Court in South Haven. Randall is also charged with possession of marijuana.

Passerby Bobby McCaig found the boy hiding in a ditch on the side of a country road about 2 am on Tuesday, WWMT reported. He had walked some two miles from where he lived.

'I stopped and asked him what was going on, and he was walking away from me the whole time,' McCaig told the station.

'I noticed he was limping. He told me where he lived, and I said I am going to go get your mom and he started freaking out.'

wrist and arms his legs was bleeding — he didn't have none of that on him,' Randy Hamilton, Randall's twin brother, told WOOD-TV.
