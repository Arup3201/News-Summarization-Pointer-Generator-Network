Court of Appeal Judge Sir Alan Moses (pictured) will head the new Press regulator IPSO, which is replacing the Press Complaints Commission

The judge who presided over the Soham murder trial is to head the new Press regulator being set up in the wake of the Leveson inquiry.

Court of Appeal Judge Sir Alan Moses, who was said to have been so enraged by 'sensational and lurid' coverage of the Soham case that he threw a pile of newspapers across the courtroom during a pre-trial hearing, will take up the new position next month.

The new Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) has been set up with the backing of most newspaper groups and is expected to be in operation in June, replacing the Press Complaints Commission.

Contracts will bind publishers to IPSO and give the regulator tough powers of investigation, enforcement and sanction, including fines of up to £1 million for serious and systemic wrongdoing.

Sir Alan, who has been in the Court of Appeal since 2005, and was due to retire in May, said he would aim to strike a balance between protecting the public and the need to encourage freedom of the Press.

'The public and the Press are entitled to a successful system of independent regulation. I recognise it is a big responsibility to achieve this,' he said.

'I believe that such a system should be designed to protect the public against a repetition of the breakdown in standards in some parts of the newspaper industry in recent times. At the same time it should affirm and encourage the vital role of a free and fearless Press.'

He said he was determined there would be 'no hesitation in dealing with bad practice by newspapers and providing support and vindication for those who suffer as a result of any future breakdown'.

'This new organisation will have to listen to and learn from the Press and their critics in the period ahead,' he added.

'To those who have voiced doubts as to the ability of IPSO to meet the demands of independent regulation, I say that I have spent over 40 years pursuing the profession of barrister and judge whose hallmarks are independent action and independent judgment. I do not intend to do away with that independence now.'

Sir Alan was the unanimous choice of an independent selection panel chaired by Whitehall grandee Sir Hayden Phillips, who led a review of political party funding and was previously permanent secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

Judge Moses is said to have been so enraged by coverage of the Soham case that he threw a pile of newspapers across the courtroom during one of Ian Huntley's pre-trial hearings. Pictured here are Huntley's victims, Holly Wells (left) and her best friend, Jessica Chapman, both 10

Sir Hayden said he believed the judge's reputation for being 'quick, forthright and fearless' meant he was someone 'whom the public can depend to tackle abuses by newspapers where they occur' but also a figure who 'believes firmly in independent self-regulation of the Press and in the vital democratic role of a free Press in a free society'.

The new Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said last week that he sees no further role for the Government in the issue of Press regulation.

A proposed Royal Charter to oversee press regulation, agreed in a cross-party deal with the Hacked Off lobby group, appears dead in the water, since publishers have refused to sign up.

The Government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a regulator approved under the Royal Charter could be hit with 'exemplary' damages in libel cases.

But Mr Javid said: 'The work has been done, and it is now a decision for the Press what they want to do next. I don't see any further role for Government in this.

'Notwithstanding the fact that any industry has its bad apples, I think our Press is the best in the world. It is fearless without favour.'

Sir Alan, 68, was appointed as a high court judge in 1996, before joining the Court of Appeal in 2005.

Among the trials he has presided over as a judge was the prosecution of MI5 officer David Shayler for passing classified information to the Press in breach of the Official Secrets Act.

He was also the prosecutor in the Matrix Churchill trial, when a Customs case against directors of the company accused of selling arms-related equipment to Saddam Hussein collapsed in 1992.

Publishers of the Times, Sun, the Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Daily Telegraph, Daily Express, Daily Star and virtually all regional newspapers and magazines have announced that they will sign up to IPSO. The Financial Times has announced that it will instead appoint an editorial complaints commissioner, while the Guardian and the Independent have yet to decide whether to join the new regulator.

Sir Alan was appointed a High Court judge in 1996, and moved up to the Court of Appeal in 2005

A few years ago, Sir Alan Moses went on Radio Four to discuss trendy proposals to stop some judges wearing wigs and wing collars.

If listeners expected a turgid, legalistic conversation about the minutiae of the British court system, they were to be pleasantly surprised.

Instead, after the presenter had (somewhat rudely) suggested that judges were widely seen as 'out of touch', Sir Alan hit the proverbial roof. 'It is the most monstrous suggestion, I think,' he declared.

'Is it suggested that if we listened to the Arctic Monkeys rather than listening to the  South Bank Symphonia we would be more in touch? Why?

'Don't even think that we are not [in touch]. Don't even dare to suggest that we are not!'

The comments were extraordinarily outspoken by the standards of a senior judge, so ended up being widely reported. In a  career spanning more than four decades, the 68-year-old has built a reputation for having an acute legal mind – and being  unafraid to speak it.

'Alan is nobody's fool, and nobody's patsy,' says one long-standing professional  acquaintance. 'He is often called “outspoken”. What that actually means is that he's independent.'

As head of the new Independent  Press Standards Organisation, Sir  Alan will lead a rigorous new watchdog backed by 90 per cent of national  newspapers and a vast majority of the regional press.

Supporters of a more draconian form of political regulation, of the kind sought by the celebrity anti-Press lobby group Hacked Off, will doubtless argue that this now makes him a puppet of the newspaper industry.

Sir Alan's track record suggests, however, that he is anything but.

During a pre-trial hearing for the 2003 Soham murder trial after the killings of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, for example, he is famously said to have been so angered by 'sensational and lurid' reporting of the case  that he threw a stack of newspapers across the courtroom.

The previous year he rejected  attempts by David Shayler – a former MI5 agent who passed secret documents to journalists – to defend himself by arguing that he had been acting in the public interest.

Instead, Sir Alan found that Shayler, who was jailed for his crime, had displayed 'blinkered arrogance' in breaking the Official Secrets Act.

More recently, as flagged by a CV  circulated yesterday, he found against the newspaper industry in two  important – if complex – 2010 and 2011 Appeal Court cases. Sir Alan has often rattled the cage of governments.

Only last year, for example, he delivered a damning after-dinner speech describing the Coalition's reforms of legal aid as 'a joke'.

In 2008, he described efforts by the Ministry of Defence to ban reporting of alleged abuse of Iraqi civilians by British soldiers as 'barmy'.

For a man so unafraid to tangle with the Establishment, Sir Alan has the most blue chip of backgrounds.

The son of a barrister, he was raised in Sevenoaks, Kent, and educated at Bryanston (where fees are now £28,000 a year) and University College, Oxford.

Called to the Bar in 1968, he worked as junior counsel for the Inland Revenue in the 1980s before acting as prosecutor in the 1992 Matrix Churchill trial, where directors of the machine tools firm were accused of selling arms-related equipment to Saddam Hussein.

After that case was abandoned, on Sir Alan's advice, he gave scathing evidence to the subsequent Scott Inquiry into the arms-to-Iraq affair, saying that Whitehall officials had withheld evidence that 'anyone with a basic sense of justice' ought to have disclosed.

Despite his outspoken comments, he was appointed a High Court judge in 1996, and moved up to the Court of Appeal in 2005.

Were it not for his new appointment – he was chosen from a field of 200 – he would have been due to retire next year.

On the personal front, Sir Alan has three grown-up children by his first wife Penny, daughter of Sir David Hopkin (the former metropolitan stipendiary magistrate) whom he divorced in 1984.

One of them now works as a deputy production editor on the sports desk of the Guardian.

Since 1992, he has been married to Dinah Casson, the daughter of the famous architect and artist Sir Hugh. She is a prominent interior designer who specialises in staging museum and gallery exhibitions.

He enjoys hill-walking, has climbed  Ben Nevis, lists as his club the Union Socialista La Serra in Italy and spent six years on the Council of the Royal Academy.

The judge also sings in the newly formed Bar Choir.
