Sergio Busquets was the unlikely hero for Barcelona, scoring with the last kick of the game to give Luis Enrique’s side a 1-0 win over Valencia and close the gap on Real Madrid to two points.

There were 93 minutes on the clock when Lionel Messi drifted out to the right and crossed for Neymar to head goalwards. Valencia keeper Diego Alves made the save but Busquets scored from the rebound and as Messi and Co celebrated he was hit by a plastic bottle as home supporters pelted the pitch.

Valencia had defended well and gone close themselves with former Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo drawing the best save of the game from Claudio Bravo.

Neymar appears to headbutt Nicolas Otamendi as the Argentinian defender remonstrates with the Brazilian at the Mestalla

The incident came after Otamendi had challenged Neymar inside the penalty area early on in the first half

The frustration had previously been all Barcelona’s. Luis Suarez thought he had scored his first league goal for the visitors after 68 minutes but it was incorrectly ruled out for offside - the Uruguayan was level with the last Valencia defender.

There was a lively start to the first half with Jeremy Mathieu booked for chopping down Negredo. Valencia forced their first chance on 10 minutes when Rodrigo Moreno was foiled by Claudio Bravo. But although they had the early upper hand it was Barcelona who had the best opportunity of the first half and it fell to Suarez.

Gerard Pique played a long ball out of defence which Neymar cleverly flicked into Suarez’s path. The ball dropped it front of him around the penalty spot but Diego Alves in the Valencia goal made the save.

On 20 minutes Neymar went down dramatically under a challenge from Nicolas Otamendi and as if to do out-do his opponent the defender responded to the Brazilian inclining his head towards him as he bent down to remonstrate with him for diving by throwing himself down in the penalty area.

In the resulting melee neither Neymar nor Otamendi’s amateur dramatics were punished as yellow cards were shown to Pique and to Antonio Barragan.

With Alves, Jordi Alba and Mustafi all also booked, six of the eight defenders on the pitch had to face the second half on a yellow card. Andre Gomez so nearly made sure that Valencia started that second 45 minutes in front but with one shot that curled just wide and another effort into the side-netting right on the half-time whistle he failed to break the deadlock.

Suarez went close again at the start of the second half but he shot into the side-netting with only a defender to beat on the line after Diego Alves came out of his goal but failed to reach the ball. Bravo was also beaten moments later but Pique was on hand to clear off the line.

Barca coach Enrique brought on Ivan Rakitic for Mathieu and put Javier Mascherano back into the centre of defence. The change almost had an instant effect with Suarez turning in Dani Alves’ pass from the edge of the six-yard box. He was level with the last defender and the goal should have stood.

Valencia responded immediately with Negredo releasing Sofiane Feghouli but Bravo saved well to keep the shot out. And the Barca stopper then produced the save of the night when Negredo rifled a left foot shot goalward.

Pedro and Rafinha came on for Suarez and Xavi with 10 minutes left but on a night when Messi – without any pending records to smash – was barely involved it looked like ending in a stalemate that would have suited Real Madrid more than the two teams on the pitch.

But the Argentinian forward came alive in the last moments of the game. Otamendi had to slide in to deny him with the penultimate chance of the game. And, not to be denied, he then crossed for Busquets to get the winner.
