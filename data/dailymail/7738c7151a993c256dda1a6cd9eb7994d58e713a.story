A father killed his wife and 16-month-old daughter then fled 1,100 miles across the U.S. before committing suicide in a hotel room, police said.

Daniel Johnston, 29, of Oklahoma City, allegedly killed his wife Tara, 29, and daughter Allison, and was later found dead in Las Vegas, Nevada.

After flying west on Sunday, Johnston committed suicide in the hotel room last night. He did it by cutting his wrists and ankles, his father claimed.

Mystery: Daniel Johnston, 29, of Oklahoma City, allegedly killed his wife Tara, 29, left, and daughter Allison, right, and was later found dead in Las Vegas, Nevada

Marriage: The motivation for the devastation caused to the apparently happy family is unclear

Tragic: The bodies of the mother and daughter Allison, pictured, were found around 8am on Tuesday after police were contacted with an anonymous tip-off

‘It was clearly, clearly, a double homicide,’ Oklahoma City Police Sergeant Gary Knight said. ‘And it was also clear that the guy killed himself.’

Police had been looking for Johnston after they found his relatives’ bodies on Tuesday morning. Their times of death are currently unclear.

Authorities are also probing any potential motive. Johnston’s only bad mark on his record before the alleged killings was a traffic ticket.

‘How an adult or someone could harm a child is unbelievable to us,’ the victims' next door neighbour Al Fielder told CBS affiliate KWTV.

‘They seemed very happy. They would 
walk up and down the street, walking their baby in the stroller. This is
the most unlikely thing.’

Scene: The home where the bodies were found, in far northeast Oklahoma City, is near the boundary that separates the city from nearby Edmond

Father and baby: Police uncovered the tragedy in Oklahoma and Nevada on Tuesday after two bodies were found at the home in Oklahoma City

Smiles: Neighbours said the couple seemed 'very happy' and were often seen out and about, walking their baby in a pram

One of Mrs Johnston's colleagues paid tribute to her 'happy and positive' co-worker, who was never daunted by misfortune.

'She loved her daughter,' the colleague continued. 'Allison was her life.'

The turbulent end to her life seems 
to have come out of the blue, as just two weeks ago she was publicly showing 
affection to her husband.

'Happy Valentine's Day to the most wonderful husband in the world!!', she wrote on her Facebook profile.

Mrs Johnston's best friend Christina 
Kalabic also spoke warmly of her, and added that she found it difficult 
to blame Daniel Johnston for his actions.

'It's hard for me to talk bad about him,' she said, 'because I knew him as well and 
it's hard for me to say he was a bad guy because I really don't think he
was.'

The bodies of the mother and daughter were found shortly before 8am on Tuesday after police were contacted with an anonymous tip.

The home where the bodies were found, in far northeast Oklahoma City, is near the boundary that separates the city from nearby town Edmond.
