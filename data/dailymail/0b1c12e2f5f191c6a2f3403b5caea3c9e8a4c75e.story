President Bush has been criticized for making poor speeches, but according to a new survey, Obama's address to the American people is only slightly more sophisticated.

Vocativ calculated data on 600 presidential speeches from George Washington on using a reading comprehension algorithm called the Flesh-Kincaid readability test.

The algorithm measures each speech's word count, sentence length, and word syllables and then assigns a numerical grade parallel with educational level.

Comprable: Obama's speeches measure only slightly more sophisticated than former president George Bush who was criticized for making poor public addresses to the nation

Data: Bush (red) and Obama (blue were graded similarly numerically in trms of speech sophistication

Vocativ reports that a number grade four indicates that the speech could be understood by a fourth-grader.

A number 12 means the speech would be understood by a college graduate and a grade of 21 or higher is comprehensible by people who have achieved a PHD.

After calculating the data Vocativ reached five conclusions which a former speech writer for Bill Clinton by the name of Jeff Shesol analysed.

Speeches made by Obama and Bush were numerically graded somewhere between 7 and 11 and both of their speeches ranked similarly.

'I don't see a huge discrepancy here. I think President Obama, no more or less than President Bush, tries to pack a lot of nuance and subtext into language that is as plain and straightforward as possible. While President Bush was often inarticulate off the cuff, Bush's speeches were underestimated. There was a crisp formality to a lot of his best speeches, particularly the ones he delivered shortly after Sept. 11,' said Shesol after looking at the numbers.

Long winded: Over time speeches have gotten longer and longer and presidents like Bill Clinton have been criticized for making lengthy State of the Union addresses 

Longer: Over the years, presidential speeches have gotten longer and longer from the 1700s until now

The study also finds that speeches have become less sophisticated over time because at first presidents were merely speaking to men similar to themselves in education and in status sin life.

'It's tempting to read this as a dumbing down of the bully pulpit,' Shesol says.

'But it’s actually a sign of democratization. In the early Republic, presidents could assume that they were speaking to audiences made up mostly of men like themselves: educated, civic-minded landowners. These, of course, were the only Americans with the right to vote. But over time, the franchise expanded and presidential appeals had to reach a broader audience.'

Not only have speeches gotten less sophisticated they have also gotten longer.

President Clinton was one modern president who would get criticism for writing lengthy State of the Union addresses.

Most variance: Lincoln made speeches with varying degrees of sophistication but his Gettysburg Address was so well received the John F. Kennedy's spech writer looked to it as a reference.

'One would assume that our decreasing attention span has led to shorter and shorter speeches. I believe that no one, not even a president, ought to give a speech that's longer than 20 minutes. President Clinton used to get tremendous grief from commentators about the length of his State of the Union addresses. But our polling showed that the public liked the long speeches—and people actually stayed tuned. But very few speakers are as compelling as Bill Clinton,' said former speechwriter Shesol.

The study finds that when presidents like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington made speeches to Native Americans that they simplified their language.

Though, Shesol says that this type of variation is rarely seen today.

'If Washington and Jefferson simplified their language when speaking to Native Americans, they must have seen some kind of gap, either in language or in shared cultural understanding (or both), between themselves and their audience. Presidents today certainly modify their language when speaking to different groups—when speaking in Little Rock, Arkansas, President Clinton would often roll out Southern expressions that you'd never hear him use in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. But when a live microphone or camera is in front of them, presidents are really speaking to everyone at once. So I don't imagine you'd see this degree of variation today,' says Shesol.

The data shows that Abraham Lincoln's speeches ranged in numerical grade from seven to 21.

Lincoln’s Gettysburg address was so inspirational that that both John F. Kennedy and his speechwriter would refer to it for inspiration.

According to the speechwriter, one syllable words as oppose to three syllable words make the speech more effective.
