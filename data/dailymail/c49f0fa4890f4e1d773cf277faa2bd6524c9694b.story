When a photographer  took a trip to one of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's pet projects - built to bring in thousands of foreign tourists to the country - he discovered a sparkling clean ski resort... with barely another person or drop of snow in sight.

The communist enclave's one and only ski destination, on top of Taehwa Peak, boasts a hotel with wood cabin style rooms, complimentary toiletries, and spa facilities and 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes.

However, photographer Aram Pan, from Singapore, who took the photos while on his fourth trip to North Korea from 16-20 October, did not find any other tourists to mingle with.

'I saw one western tourist on a "private tour" at the Ski resort. I’m not sure who he was. I didn't ask,' Mr Pan told Daily Mail Australia.

Ski lifts were bought from China to transport visitors to the 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level slopes. They were originally going to be bought from Switzerland but the deal was blocked because of trade sanctions

The Masikryong ski resort was built on top of Taehwa Peak, near the port city and naval base Wonsan, in just 10 months 

Photographer Aram Pan was given access to photograph the wood cabin style bedrooms, including this one in the 'Second Class Accommodation'

‘Other than that, there’s only the locals working on several upgrades before the winter season.

‘There’s no snow now so I had expected it to be empty,’ he added.

Mr Pan said the lack of people didn't matter to him, as his five day vacation gave him the chance 'to capture the autumn colours and also do an exclusive full access tour of the Masikryong Ski Resort during their off-peak season’.

The Masikryong ski resort, built on top of Taehwa Peak, near the port city and naval base Wonsan, opened for business earlier this year and hopes to bring 5,000 visitors a day.

The massage room in the hotel spa features two beds, which can be divided by a curtain for privacy  

Mr Pan said the pools 'are especially nice since the weather outside is cold and the water is nice and warm'

The pool was complete and ready for swimmers to enjoy but nobody was swimming lengths in October 

A large sauna room is big enough for many visitors to sweat it out but when Mr Pan visited there was nobody using it 

The steam room with white plastic seats was also empty but looked sparkling clean 

Full body dryers stood side by side and basic showers were provided in the spa area 

Treadmills, a bicycle and cross-trainer machines are offered up for visitors to keep their fitness up while on vacation 

The sprawling 1,400-hectare resort was built in just ten months as part of a push by leader Kim Jong-un to increase overseas tourist numbers from 200,000 to 1 million per annum by 2016.

Although tourists and official regime photographers have taken some photos of the resort before, Mr Pan was given exclusive access to all parts of the destination – apart from two prized new areas that are still under construction...

‘I was permitted to photograph a comprehensive collection of images of the entire facility. The only stuff I wasn’t permitted to photograph was the new helicopter landing pad currently being built and the latest extension to their ski lift system that is also under construction,’ he explained.

Mr Pan stayed in the onsite hotel in a 'third-class room' and tried out the facilities, including a gym, sauna, hairdressers, and restaurant and had the whole place to himself.

An onsite ski shop sells a limited range of goods, including bright coloured trainers, backpacks and sports clothing 

Bottled water and other soft drinks are sold in the food section of the shop in refrigerators 

Visitors can hire skis and snow boots from the resort. At the end of last year, a ski-less Kim Jong-Un was photographed surveying the then snowy surroundings during his visit 

For guests looking to party, there is a karaoke and dance room with coloured lighting and a marble floor

‘The pools are especially nice since the weather outside is cold and the water is nice and warm,’ he said.

At the end of last year, a ski-less Kim Jong-Un was photographed surveying the snowy surroundings during his visit. The leader was said to note 'with great satisfaction' that everything was 'impeccable'.

He also gave instructions to serve visitors to the site well - and ensure they may 'keenly feel the loving care of the party', local media reported.

The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) described the slopes as a 'great monumental structure in the era of Songun', referring to the nation's 'military first' policy.

Some rather clinical lighting gave the bathroom a yellow-hue but it was clear everything was brand new

Free North Korean toiletries were provided in Mr Pan's en-suite bathroom 

The military played a leading role in the project, with soldiers from the Korean People’s Army helping to build it.

 Hundreds of snow canons from Sweden are used to keep the resort looking its best and there are also Italian snow-ploughs and Canadian snow mobiles

But in August 2013 a $8.5 million deal with a Swiss ski-lift manufacturer was blocked by the Swiss government based on UN laws that prohibit certain export sales to North Korea.

The communist-regime got around the issue by buying their ski-lifts closer to home.

‘In case you are wondering where they got the ski lifts because of the embargo, they brought them in from China. I rode on all of the Chinese ski lifts and they felt safe and stable,’ Mr Pan said.
