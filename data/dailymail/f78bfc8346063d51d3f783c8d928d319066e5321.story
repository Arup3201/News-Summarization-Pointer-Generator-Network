Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini firmly believes his team will be challenging for a Champions League berth until the end of the season.

'There's a long way to go,' Mancini told a news conference on Saturday.

'I'm sure we will be fighting for third place till the end and I know we can finish there. Now's not the time to look at the tables. The key is to keep on improving.'

But boss Roberto Mancini is adamant that they can still qualify for the Champions League

Mancini began his second spell in charge of Inter by taking one point from three games before they won at Chievo on Monday.

'I can't be satisfied since we've lost twice,' he said.

'However, I'm happy to see that the players are learning and improving. We can definitely make up ground in the next months.'

Mancini has see his Inter side just win one game out of four since he returned to the club

Inter are in 11th position in Serie A on 20 points, seven behind third-placed Napoli who have a game in hand.

Inter face Lazio on Sunday and Mancini has never lost to his former team.

He played for Lazio for three years, a run that ended gloriously as the Roman club won their second Serie A title in 2000.

He went on to manage the team for two seasons before moving to Inter.

'They (Lazio) are a dangerous team,' Mancini said. 'It's true that they have lost five games already but they deserved better in a few of them.'
