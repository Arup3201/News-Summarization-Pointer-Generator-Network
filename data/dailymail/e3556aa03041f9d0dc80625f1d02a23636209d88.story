The mysteries of conception were explained to the Queen today as she toured a world-leading research institute dubbed the "Nobel Prize factory".

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh 
arrived at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge by scheduled train service from London, 
then travelled the short distance from the station by single decker bus,
part of the guided busway service.

Inside the research centre the Queen appeared fascinated as she peered down a powerful microscope to look at minute mice eggs and scientists explained their work trying to discover why some women trying to conceive produce abnormal eggs.

The Queen arrived at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology by bus today

The world-leading Cambridge research institute has been dubbed the 'Nobel Prize factory'

The Royal couple travelled the short distance from Cambridge station by single decker bus, although they were seated apart

About ten perfectly circular mice eggs had been readied for viewing by Dr Melina Schuh and her team.

The visit marked the official opening by
the Queen of the institute's new £212 million building which provides 
better facilities and equipment for the 600 scientists and support 
staff.

Later, during a visit to a maternity hospital the Queen picked up some tips to pass
on to the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge.

One does not look amused: The bus, part of the guided bus service, arrived more than 15 minutes late

The Queen and Prince Philip are used to rather more glamorous escorts but the new single decker bus IS eco-friendly so son Charles will be pleased with today's transport week

A small pool used by Claire Morris, 42, to give birth to her first child
in the early hours of this morning left the Queen intrigued.

The new mother and her partner Stephen Tibbett, 44, proudly showed off 
their daughter, Charlotte Rose Tibbett Morris, when the Queen and Duke 
of Edinburgh toured a new £30 million extension to Cambridge's Rosie 
Maternity Hospital.

Their baby had been crying seconds before the Queen arrived but as she walked into the room the infant fell silent.

Ms Morris went into labour at midnight yesterday and explained to the 
Queen she finally gave birth at 2.46am this morning to a daughter 
weighing 8lbs 3oz.

After speaking to the monarch she explained the benefits of the warmed 
water in the birth pool, saying 'the heat is a bit relaxing and gives 
pain relief and water means you're less weighted'.

The mother, a garden designer from the village of Impington near 
Cambridge, joked: 'The Queen was interested in the birthing pool, maybe 
she's doing some research for Kate - who knows,'.

The Duchess, who is around seven months pregnant, is due to give birth 
in mid-July and there is speculation she will have her baby in the 
private Lindo maternity wing of St Mary's hospital in London.

Ms Morris added: 'This has been a pretty amazing, magical day. About 
five years ago I was told the chances of me falling pregnant naturally 
were pretty remote.'

Researchers at the facility have been awarded nine Nobel Prizes since it opened in 1947

One of the most famous Nobel awards went to James Watson and Francis Crick who, with Maurice Wilkins, won the 1962 Nobel for medicine for their discovery of the structure of DNA

The £212million Medical Research Council 
Laboratory of Molecular Biology is one of the world's leading research 
institutes, dedicated to tackling major problems in human health and 
disease.

The Laboratory of Molecular Biology 
(LMB) has been pioneering medical breakthroughs since it was established
in 1947 and researchers working at the facility have been awarded nine 
Nobel Prizes.

One of the most famous awards went to
James Watson and Francis Crick who, with Maurice Wilkins, won the 1962 
Nobel for medicine for their discovery of the structure of DNA.

The Queen was charmed by the children she met outside the maternity hospital during her visit

The latest Nobel was won by Venki 
Ramakrishnan in 2009, who used x-ray crystallography to determine the 
structure of ribosomes - complex, bead-like structures found in cells - 
which translate the DNA code into life, producing the tens of thousands 
of different proteins that in turn control the chemistry in all living 
organisms.

The work shed 
light on how antibiotics function and will be critical in developing new
antibiotics to combat infection and disease.
