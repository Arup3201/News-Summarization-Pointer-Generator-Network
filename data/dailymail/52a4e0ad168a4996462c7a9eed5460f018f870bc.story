They were born when George V was king, Herbert Henry Asquith was prime minister and World War One was just underway.

Eric and Herbert Walton - the oldest male twins in the United Kingdom - turned 100 today and, as usual, they are celebrating the major milestone together.

And they are sharing their secret to a long life: good genes and a fit and active lifestyle.

Making history together: Eric and Herbert Walton are the oldest living male twins in the UK 

Born in Gateshead in 1914, they were raised in the area by their mum Mary, who was left a single mother after their father George was killed in World War One in 1917.

Both did their part in World War Two, with Herbert serving in the army on the ships and Eric making weapons at engineering company Vickers.

Since then they have seen their fair share of historic events - from the end of communism across Eastern Europe with the fall of the Berlin Wall to the return of combat with the 9/11 attacks in the US.

Eric's 63-year-old son, Chris, a retired headmaster, said: ‘They have both been active and positive throughout their lives, and I’m proud of that.'

Their mother, Mary Walton, nee Rogers, lived until the age of 98 and their grandmother lived a year longer to see 99.

The brothers have spent almost every birthday together and remain close - living only about 15 miles apart.

Eric said: ‘I can’t believe we’ve reached 100, but we’re both happy about it.'

Herbert joked: ‘He keeps me alive. He’s the only one of us who can sing.'

Eric has three children, including his 76-year-old daughter, Ruth, who he had with his first wife, Winifred, who died at 28 years old.

He then remarried and had son Chris and daughter Jennifer, 59, with his second wife, Mary.

Herbert married pianist and music teacher Florence. Together, they had one son - Everard, 70.

Between the two brothers, they now have nine grandchildren and six great grandchildren, with Eric also being a great-great-grandfather.

‘They’ve always been out and about and they are surrounded by loving family and friends. They are certainly the figureheads of the family,’ Eric’s son Chris said.

‘Although they are twins they are so different. Herbert has the go and get them type of personality where Eric was always the more laid back out of the two,’ said Eric’s eldest daughter Ruth.

‘I loved gardening and had my own allotment. I even grew an apple tree in the garden from a small pip,’ Eric said.

Herbert added: ‘Eric always liked his gardening but I loved paintings, art and music. I was more into the academic side of things, and of course I went on to be a headteacher.'

While Eric had 14 jobs in his lifetime, Herbert turned to teaching after the war and served as headteacher at Lindisfarne Primary School in Gateshead for many years.

Ruth said: ‘They have always been really close, even when they were younger they would ride their motorbikes together.

'Both of them have led an active life and I think this has helped them to reach 100 years, but it is really strange for two twins to reach this together.' 

The men are set to mark the impressive milestone with a party.

And just like most of their previous birthdays, they have chosen to mark the momentous milestone together.

‘We have enjoyed all our life and we’ve had some marvellous experiences,’ Herbert said.
