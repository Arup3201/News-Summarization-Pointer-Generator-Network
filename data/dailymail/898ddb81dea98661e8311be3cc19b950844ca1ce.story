A walker has captured an incredible photo of two clouds shaped like the British Isles.

Sue Strang, 44, was amazed when she spotted the remarkable cloud formation, while walking with her husband, Chris Corlett.

'We were out walking and as I looked in the sky I suddenly saw the clouds, so I grabbed my mobile to take a photo,' said Sue, from the Isle of Man.

Uncanny: The British Isles as seen from space. The cloud even has some of the Scottish isles in roughly the right place

'I couldn't believe it at first, you can clearly make out England, with a pointed part for Cornwall and the other cloud looks exactly like Ireland.'

Sue, who works as a public servant for the Communications Commission, saw the cloud at Marine Drive on a recent walk from Port Soderick to Douglas on the Isle of Man.

The wispy clouds clearly show England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales and even some of the Scottish islands.
