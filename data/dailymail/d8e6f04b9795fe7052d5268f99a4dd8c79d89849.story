Banned: Joanna Shuter, former head of Quintin Kynaston in north London, has been barred from teaching for life

A disgraced headteacher has been banned for life from the classroom after spending more than £30,000 of public money on lavish parties taxis and mobile phone bills.

Joanna Shuter, who was once named headteacher of the year and awarded a CBE, used £6,292,20 of funds for Quintin Kynaston School in north London to pay for her own 50th birthday party.

She claimed another £5,855.67 for taxis, as well as £8,269 for an overnight stay at the Grove Hotel, Hertfordshire.

Her children's mobile phone bills were also charged back to the school.

Today, Ms Shuter, 53, was found guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while working at Quintin Kynaston School in north London - and banned from teaching indefinitely. 

A judgment approved by the Education Secretary also barred her from applying to lift the order at a later date.

Ms Shuter, who was awarded a CBE in 2010 for services to teaching, resigned from her post a the school in St John's Wood last year while the government launched a probe. It found she had used school funds for 'inappropriate purposes'.

It emerged Ms Shuter bought furniture worth £1,500 that was delivered to her home.

She also claimed on expenses for posh dinners, personal taxi rides and nearly £3,500 in flowers.

Today's judgement issued by a 
professional conduct panel found that she had been a 'force for good' in
 many respects - but that her expenses claims 'undermined' the entire 
teaching profession.

The 
staggering bill for her 50th birthday party in 2011 included money spent
 on catering, alcohol, food, party lights and 'landscaping' - as well as
 extra pay for the staff's time. That money was not paid back for more 
than a year.

Ms Shuter admitted the allegations, the judgement says.

The panel said her 'unacceptable' claims at Quintin Kynaston 'undermined' the entire profession

She also admitted taking on paid work for speaking at conferences and consultancy during term time.

Her personal assistant was instructed to carry out non-school related tasks such as organising her public speaking engagements, booking flights for her family and arranging the rental of her holiday home.

The panel said: 'In light of the panel’s findings against Ms Shuter, which involved making numerous and extensive expenses claims in respect of public money, over a significant period of time for personal gain, there is a strong public interest consideration in maintaining public confidence in the profession.

'This is particularly so in Ms Shuter’s 
case, in light of her high national profile as an influential figure in 
the education world and public recognition as Headteacher of the Year 
and her receipt of a CBE.

'This high profile increases the risk of public
 confidence in the profession being undermined.

Ms Shuter, who has previously been named as headteacher of the year, spent nearly £3,500 on flowers

Ms Shuter cannot apply to lift the life ban as she showed 'a lack of insight into the severity of her behaviours'

'The Panel is also of the view that in the climate of recent years, the public interest in maintaining public confidence in the management of public finances, including ensuring that expenses claims against public funds are appropriate, is particularly strong.

'Accordingly, the Panel considers that public confidence in the profession could be seriously weakened if conduct such as that found against Ms Shuter were not treated with the utmost seriousness when regulating the conduct of the profession.'

It added that while Ms Shuter had admitted her wrongdoing she had also showed 'a lack of insight into the severity and impact of her behaviours'.

The document says that in respect of the birthday party, Ms Shuter set up separate accounting for them but failed to reimburse the school until she repaid £5,906.98 in April 2012 - more than a year after receiving an invoice for it.
