Hearthrob boyfriend? Check. Plum acting gig? Check. High Street fashion campaign? Check. If she isn't already on your radar than British actress Tamsin Egerton is one to watch this year.

The 24-year-old Home Counties girl shot to fame as naughty schoolgirl Chelsea Parker in the St Trinian's movie back in 2007 and has steadily been building  her CV and FROW portfolio since.

This year her star is set to rocket as she stars alongside industry darlings Lily Collins and Suki Waterhouse in Cecelia Ahern's film Love Rosie, and dates Hollywood dreamboat Josh Hartnett while still finding time to make handbags look fabulous as the latest face of London-born acessories brand Accessorize.

Actress Tamsin Egerton has been signed as the face of British High Street brand Accessorize

The 24-year-old will appear in the autumn/winter campaign shots styled as a London girl-about-town

Blonde Tamsin is 
following in the stylish steps of Kate Upton, Claudia Schiffer and Bar 
Rafaeli as a face of the brand.

Shot in London by photographer Ben Weller and styled by former Harper’s Bazaar fashion editor Naomi Miller, the campaign shows Tamsin as a girl-about-town carrying the season’s most coveted bags and exaggerated heirloom style jewellery along with her laid-back city-wear.

The campaign has been planned to develop along with the season, with more grown-up styling for October, including fashion-forward bags and look-at-me jewels, street style knits and beanies for November and the brand's signature sparkling Christmaswear shots for December.

Egerton says of her own look; 'My style is schizophrenic! One minute I'll be wearing bright girly dresses and the next I'll be swinging towards more structured masculine things.

'I don't like to only have one particular style as it means I get bored easily. I love dressing up for events, to me it's almost like wearing a costume for the evening. I'm personally becoming more daring and experimental with my style so I can't wait to bring that out on the next red carpet.'

The November images include street inspired beanies and cosy knits

Tamsin did some modelling as a teenager, but found it 'boring' and decided to concentrate on acting instead of going to university

The campaign includes glamorous festive studio shots for Christmas featuring sparkles and statement jewellery

Tamsin did some modelling as a teenager, but found it ‘boring’
and decided to concentrate on acting instead of going to university. 
When she left school at 16, she strolled straight into the Brit-com 
Keeping Mum with Maggie Smith, Rowan Atkinson and Kristin Scott Thomas 
and has worked ever since, relishing the challenges of each new role.

Ahead
filming her latest movie in Ireland, based on Aherne's best-selling 
book Where Rainbows End, ex-model Tamsin told the Daily Mail: 'Romcoms
are such fun, I just hope we can do the book justice. We start filming 
in Dublin in a few weeks. I haven’t been to Dublin since Camelot so I’m 
really looking forward to it, but I think the weather may be a bit 
different.'
