When artworks by famous landscaper John Constable go under the hammer, they can expect to fetch well in excess of £20m.

But now the beautiful countryside on which arguably Britain's most famous painter based many of works is up for sale at a bargain price of £1.75m.

A total of 231 acres of land in Dedham Vale - just north of Colchester on the Suffolk and Essex border - have been put up for sale.

Art history: The land for sale is near the village of Dedham, whose church featured in John Constable's painting Dedham Lock and Mill

It features water meadows, lowland grass, arable farmland and fishing rights, so the new owner will be buying themselves a piece of quintessential English history.

Constable's 1831 masterpiece Salisbury Cathedral was bought by The Tate in May 2013 for £23.1m and last year 2012 The Lock became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold when it fetched £22.4m at auction.

So whilst the £1.75m asking price may be out of reach of many art fans, it is still less than 10 per cent of the price of each of those two iconic paintings.

Inspired: The Essex and Suffolk countryside featured in some of Constable's most famous works, such as The Hay Wain

Water bargain: The picturesque land is up for sale at £1.75m

Popular: The land could well be snapped up by an American, as people from the US have a huge passion for John Constable, the seller has said

The land for sale even features in one of Constable's most famous works, The Dedham Vale, painted in 1802.

Countryside campaigners are calling on the National Trust to buy the land to safeguard its future for the nation.

Robert Erith, president of the Dedham Vale Society, said: ‘The land on the Essex side of the River Stour was given by my family to the National Trust in the early Fifties and it would be a very nice thing if the National Trust were to own the Suffolk side as well.

‘There is very little any landowner could do with it apart from keeping it natural because it is in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and associated with John Constable who painted in that part of the country.

Reel worth: Whoever snaps up the land will enjoy 1,200m of fishing rights along the River Stour

Plea: Countryside campaigners are calling on the National Trust to buy the land

‘There are a lot of potential buyers who would be likely to appreciate the sensitivity of the landscape but if the National Trust were to buy it, it would then belong to the nation. ‘

The land - which is privately owned by a local farm - could even be snapped up by rich Americans who have a passion for Constable who was born in nearby East Bergholt.

Chris Leney, of Robinson and Hall, which is marketing the land, said: ‘Americans seem to have a lot of interest in Constable.

‘We have sold a lot [of land] to them over the years around there.

‘We have two or threes potential types of buyers. We have farmer buyers who might buy it to graze cattle; investor buyers who would see it as an investment for pension funds or other funding and the third sort, because of its location, will be interested in Constable himself and the history.’

Whoever snaps up the land, they will be unable to make any great changes to its character because it is protected as it is within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

They will, though, be able to enjoy 1,200m of fishing rights along the River Stour, 90 acres of arable farmland and 142 acres of water meadows.
