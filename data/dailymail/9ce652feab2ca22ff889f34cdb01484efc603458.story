A two-year-old toddler needed to be freed by firefighters after getting her head stuck on a 50p toy tractor ride.

Isabelle Preece became firmly wedged after squeezing her head between the two bars of the garden centre attraction.

Her concerned mother Charlotte, 25, who had decided to treat Isabelle for being so well behaved during their shopping trip, was forced to call the fire brigade after attempts by staff to free her failed. 

Stuck in the middle: Isabelle Preece, two, can be seen with her head trapped between two bars on a garden centre ride in Donnighton, Shropshire, as a firefighter tries to free her

Fire crews arrived at Wyevale Garden Centre, Donnington, Shropshire, where they worked to release the Isabelle who had to wear safety goggles and a helmet. 

It wasn’t until firefighters turned to their bar bending tool - usually reserved for rescuing people trapped in cars - that she was finally freed 20 minutes later.

Isabelle was then reunited with her relieved mother and father Ayden, 26 - but then insisted she finish her go on the ride.

Charlotte, a school teacher, said: 'We went with friends to the play barn at the centre and Isabelle went on the tractor with her friend Vinnie.

'The next thing I know she was crying and I ran over and discovered she had got her head caught between the bars that run down the side.

Worth the wait: Firefighters cheered Isabelle up after her ordeal by giving her a ride in a fire engine

'She was completely lodged and there was no way of getting her out.

'We had a look at the mechanics and it was one solid piece - there was no way of unscrewing it.We had to call the fire brigade.

'Isabelle was a bit panicked until I ran over but as soon as I was with her she was really calm and brave and just rested her head on a pillow that staff brought out.

'She looked pretty fed up and had a bit of a stroppy face, which you can see in the picture.'

She told how the fire service managed to free the toddler in less than 20 minutes. 

Brave: After being freed Isabelle, two, immediately wanted another go on the ride

Charlotte added: 'The fire brigade came and broke the bars and got her out really quickly.

'She was given a fireman's helmet and they gave her a trip in their fire engine since she had been so brave.

'She got to go on the fire engine so she was happy in the end and loved the attention.

'I think she wants to be a firefighter when she grows up now, she was really quite taken with them when she met them.'

Tim Hughes crew manager at Telford Central Fire Station said: 'An appliance was mobilised just after 11am to reports of a child with their head stuck in a toy tractor.

'On arrival we found a two-year-old girl trapped by her head through the bars in the side of an electric toy tractor.

'We used small gear and hydraulic cutting and spreading tools to bend the piece of equipment and safely rescue the child.

'We thought it would be nice to give the incident a happy ending for her so we invited Isabelle to come on the truck and relax a bit to make it a positive experience for her.

'All the fire crew enjoyed meeting her. She was very brave as normally children can be quite distressed but she sat there and let us do what we needed to do.

'She put the safety goggles and helmet on and sat calmly while we rescued her.'

Rob Macmaster duty manager at Wyevale Garden Centre said: 'It was brought to my attention that a little girl had somehow put her head outside the tractor and got it stuck so I called the fire brigade straight away.

'They came and freed her within a matter of minutes and everything was fine.

'We got her out with no injuries and we gave her some sweets so she was quite happy.'
