The father of Rolf Harris’s grandson split up from the star’s daughter after being told he had abused a schoolgirl, a court heard yesterday.

Malcolm Cox, who was in a long-term relationship with the veteran entertainer’s daughter Bindi, said he ripped up a photograph of Harris with his baby son in disgust after hearing he had allegedly sexually assaulted Bindi’s childhood friend.

Southwark Crown Court heard that the shocking allegations destroyed his relationship with Bindi, now 50, and ‘immeasurably’ changed his attitude towards  Harris having any access to their son, Marlon, who was six months old at the time.

The alleged victim, who cannot be 
named for legal reasons, claims Harris, now 84, subjected her to a 
16-year campaign of abuse starting when she was aged 13 during  holidays
 and sleepovers with his daughter.

For years she kept silent, despite Harris allegedly assaulting her at the age of 15 while his daughter slept just feet away.

But
 late one evening in 1996, at the TV presenter’s home in Bray, 
Berkshire, she dramatically  confided in Bindi and Mr Cox, who had just 
become parents.

Mr Cox 
recalled how Bindi’s friend told him ‘that there had been a sexual 
relationship between the two, between Rolf and her, and it had occurred 
before the age of 16.’ He added: ‘The inference was that it was an 
underage relationship – definitely.’

He told jurors that he believed her allegations.

Prosecuting, Sasha Wass QC asked him how he felt about Harris having contact with Marlon, who  is now 18.

Mr Cox said: ‘I carried a photograph in my wallet which was a photo of Marlon and Rolf together and it’s ripped.

‘I have taken the Rolf half away.’

Mr Cox said his ‘rocky’ four- year  relationship with Bindi fell apart, adding: ‘It got really bad at that point.’

He
 told jurors that Bindi and her friend stayed up all night discussing 
the abuse after the alleged  victim told Bindi that she was just 15 at 
the time.

Miss Wass asked: 
‘Did Bindi ever tell you about anything (the  victim) had said to her 
about Rolf Harris, having sex and her age?’

Mr Cox: ‘Yes.’

Miss Wass: ‘At what age?’

Mr Cox: ‘Fifteen.’

The Australian presenter allegedly assaulted Tonya Lee, now 43, in London when she was 15, jurors heard

Under
 cross-examination by Sonia Woodley QC, defending, Mr Cox said his 
relationship with Bindi ended ‘acrimoniously’, adding that he had never 
been ‘well disposed’ towards Harris.

When
 Miss Woodley suggested that what had actually been  said was that the 
woman had been 18 at the time the relationship started, Mr Cox replied: 
‘That is a complete lie.’

Harris
 has admitted having a sexual relationship with the woman and wrote to 
her father begging for forgiveness, but he claims it started when she 
was 18 and he was 53.

Earlier,
 the court heard how the children’s TV presenter was dubbed ‘Octopus’ by
 make-up artists working for Australian TV because he was ‘all hands’.

One
 woman, who was 24 at the time, was allegedly groped more than 24 times 
in one day by Harris in front of his brother Bruce while he was filming a
 show in 1986.

The woman said he was ‘obsessed’ with her legs.

She later told a supervisor: ‘That dirty old man groped me all day – I’m really p***** off.’

Harris is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, which he denies. The trial continues.
