This is the incredible moment an elephant helped a romantic  propose to his shocked girlfriend.

Ian Cavallier, 26, decided he wanted to surprise his fiancée Katie Boling by popping the question in the presence of her favourite animal.

But he had no idea he'd be lucky enough to find an elephant who would take the ring in its trunk and present it to the lucky girl.

Job done: The elephant waits to hear her answer after handing Katie Boling the ring on behalf of boyfriend Ian Cavallier

Ian said: 'It took me forever to come up with this idea and plan it perfectly but in the end it went better than I could have ever imagined.

'When she answered The Question it was the most beautiful 'yes' I'll ever hear!'

Ian drove student Katie four hours from their home in Asheboro, North Carolina to Natural Bridge Zoo in Virginia on the pretense that they were going to see the Autumn leaves near the mountains.

Instead, the old romantic had been planning the moment for two months and taking advice from his parents and friends on how to make the special day unique.

After Ian leads a blindfolded Katie into the enclosure, the video shows the elephant taking the ring box from a zookeeper and presenting it to Katie before Ian drops to one knee and pops the question.

The couple - who started dating in January 2014 - are set to marry in October this year and due honeymoon at DisneyWorld.

Ian, an emergency room technician, said: 'There are so many great ideas out there, but I wanted it to be perfect and unique.

'Katie loves elephants, so I really wanted to incorporate one in the proposal.

'One zoo told me that they are unable to do anything like that, so at first I was discouraged that it wasn't going to work out.

'But I was very happy to find a place that did elephant rides and even had the proposal package. They helped out so much and were very polite.

'I could tell Katie was surprised, and I'm very glad she was!

'I will never forget the moment she started tearing up and hugging me while I was pouring my heart out to her and her gorgeous smile when the elephant handed her the ring

'I was very nervous - letting the elephant hand the box with the ring in it to her was a big leap of faith.

'But everything went better than I could have imagined, and the elephant didn't drop or eat the ring!

'I met her back in 2013 and always had a crush on her. I never thought we would come this far, but I have very lucky and blessed that she is in my life and we are getting married!'
