A policeman's lot may not be a happy one – but it certainly has its lighter moments.

Officers in the West Country have revealed how some of the most bizarre callouts involve fancy dress, including a brawling traffic cone, a thieving Sherlock Holmes and a drunk Jesus.

Officers in Devon and Cornwall have attended 31 crimes committed by people in fancy dress in the last 18 months, a freedom of information request revealed.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police warned people in fancy dress that they are not above the law.

He said: 'Often when people are in fancy dress they are on stag dos or at other parties which can involve significant amounts of alcohol.

'Just because people have had a drink doesn’t mean it is acceptable for them to behave inappropriately.

'Just because they are in fancy dress doesn’t mean they are above the law.'
