Feminist group FORCE takes issue with messages such as 'Sure thing' emblazoned across Victoria's Secret underwear

Underwear emblazoned with anti-rape phrases have been planted in over a dozen Victoria's Secrets' stores across by North America and Europe by a US feminist group.

The U.S feminist group FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture, continued its crusade against Victoria's Secrets by carrying out its 'operation panty drop'

The activists are fighting what they 
call a 'culture of rape' and take issue with the messages such as 'Sure 
thing' emblazoned across the front of Victoria's Secret underwear.

Over the weekend Rebecca Nagle, 26, and Hannah Brancato, 27, along with a number of 'consent enthusiasts' launched co-ordinated strikes against the lingerie store, sneaking in thongs emblazoned with 'No means no' and placing them alongside the official lingerie line.

'What we’re doing is one tactic within a bunch of necessary tactics to change our culture,' Nagle told the Daily News.

Earlier this month the group tried to 
convince American fashion media that Victoria's Secret's PINK line was 
launching a special collection of sexual consent-themed underwear, 
sending out a fake press release and launching a fake website under the 
Victoria's Secret name.

In its original press release, PINK 
Loves Consent claimed to be a new Victoria's Secret line that 'promotes 
consent to fight rape in new panties.'

The PINK Loves Consent website, with a Victoria's Secret copyright notice on the bottom and the brand's logo at the top, features a model wearing  underwear with the phrase 'No Means No'.

The line has its own Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, and the website claims to have more than five milliion members who have joined the 'consent revolution'.

The website also shows how the Victoria's Secret PINK 
line has evolved with 'Then and Now' sections that read: 'Then we loved 
styles that were all about rape culture. Now we love styles that are all
about consent! Catch the changes hitting stores this holiday season.'

Sexual consent campaign: Feminist group FORCE has launched 'operation panty drop', putting fake PINK thongs with the words 'No Means No' next to real Victoria's Secret underwear that say 'Unwrap Me'

The website also has a Facts box which reads: 'By the time women in the United 
States graduate from college, one in four will have been raped.

'Every
21 hours someone is raped on a college campus. Women are twice as 
likely to be raped in their lifetime than to develop breast cancer.'

When Jezebel's
Katie Baker spoke to Molly Reagan, who says she is the 'Media Relations
with Victoria's Secret's new PINK loves CONSENT line,' she said she was
working for Victoria's Secret.

However
a Limited Brands spokesperson (which owns Victoria's Secret), rebuffed 
these claims, saying: 'This is not an official PINK campaign. We are 
looking into it.'

The website is still active, and now 
that FORCE has admitted it is behind the PINK Loves Consent campaign, 
it is taking to brick-and-mortar Victoria's Secret stores to spread 
their message, putting its PINK Loves Consent underwear next to real Victoria's Secret lingerie.

According
to the FORCE website, it wants 'customers who hadn’t heard about PINK 
Loves Consent on the internet to stumble upon it in stores.' 

Despite the unwanted attention from Force, Victoria's Secret continued with its swim line shoot in St Barts over the weekend.

Kroes - who is married to Dutch DJ 
Sunnery James and has a one-year-old son named Phyllon Joy Gorre - kept a
hat on hand as she let her naturally wavy blonde locks fly in the wind.

Ambrosio revelled in showing off her fabulous figure in a
range of different designs on the tropical paradise of St Barts.

The mother-of-two of two's physique was impossibly fit as she sauntered around in the surf in a variety of skimpy bikinis.

According
to the FORCE website, it wants 'customers who hadn’t heard about PINK Loves Consent on the internet to stumble upon it in stores.' 

Covetable products: People that have come across the PINK Loves Consent website actually want to purchase the goods, however FORCE are unable to sell them for obvious copyright reasons

Consent revolution: FORCE hopes to draw attention to its cause through the hoax, pointing out that 'By the time women in the United 
States graduate from college, one in four will have been raped'

It continues: 'Last
week, Victoria’s Secret shut down pinklovesconsent.com and 
@loveconsent [both the website and twitter handle are back up after the 
group fought the take down] and we realized we need another method to 
spread the good news of consent.'

Apparently many people have stumbled 
upon them in stores actually want to buy them, including Jezebel's Miss 
Baker, who praised FORCE's efforts, wrote: ' My only complaint is that 
you can't actually buy anything off the site, because now I kind of want
some underwear that says 'respect' on the crotch.'

FORCE's website explains: 'When one 
shopper found them in the store in Miami, FL, she said, "When I picked 
up this pair of underwear, it was fun because I knew that they had been 
planted in the store, because I knew about pinklovesconsent.com.'

Although FORCE can't sell its prank underwear line because they would probably be sued (Victoria's Secret has already taken legal action to try and block the website, according to FORCE), the group says: 'There never was a plan to sell consent-themed panties, [it is] just to create a consent revolution!'
