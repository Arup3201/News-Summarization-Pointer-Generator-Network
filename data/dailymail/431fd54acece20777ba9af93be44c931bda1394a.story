It wouldn't be too surprising to many if New York were to be declared the most exciting city in the coutry, but when it doesn't even make the top 5, eyebrows are raised.

The city that never sleeps was beaten by the city of Oakland, in a list compiled by real estate blog Movoto.

Oakland, California beat all other major American cities however the website didn't ask for people's opinions but instead claims it used a more scientific method.

Appearances: It might not look it, but Oakland is a really 'exciting' place to be

Despite the fact that New York City is large and crammed with people and things to do, Movoto instead decided to work out which city was best by using ten criteria that they believed make a city 'exciting.'

The calculations took into account park acreage, percentage of young adults, low concentrations of big box stores and fast food restaurants, diversity of its population as well as bars, museums and movie theaters per square mile.

Movoto blogger David Cross wrote: 'This isn't a perfect definition, but you can think of our list as ways to fight that ever-present boredom everyone faces at some point or another.'

The Big Apple ended up coming in at number six whilst the city whose nickname is Oaktown came in at number one.

Too much of a good thing: The survey found that too many fast food restaurants make NYC less 'exciting'

Oakland is often the subject of bad press because of its high crime rate. The city is usually seen as the poor sister to the city across the bay, San Francisco. It came third in Movoto's list.

'When we think of an exciting place to live, we think about places where there is always something to do — whether it’s eating at new restaurants or jogging through a park. Depending on the category we looked at a criterion on a per-person or per-square-mile basis,' the blog states. 'To be very clear, we looked at each individual city’s size; this excludes suburbs or nearby cities. In other words, it’s not covering an entire metro area.'

Oakland did best on it's population diversity, museums per square mile and hip theater scene.

Even the New York Times suggested Oakland ranked amongst the 'Top Five Places to Visit' last year.

However, not everyone is impressed with Oakland's new found fame.

Oakland-born playwright Chinaka Hodge told local hip hop blog 38th Notes. 'I take issue with the idea that Oakland is worth visiting only because new has supplanted old...That notion supposes that everything I’ve loved about my city for the last 27 years is void, The [New York Times] blurb invites those who would not otherwise be interested in the cultural backbone of my city to descend and take, as opposed to respectfully visit and interact.'
