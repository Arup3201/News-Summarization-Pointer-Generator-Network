Bags packed: PCSO Oguz Batmaz, pictured at Southwark Crown Court today, passed on information from searching the police database to a criminal gang

A cocaine-dealing PCSO tipped off a criminal gang where cannabis factories were so they could steal the crop, a court heard today.

Oguz Batmaz, 27, known as 'Oz', passed on information he got from searching the Scotland Yard database so his crew had an ample supply of drugs.

He also told them what the police knew about them so they could avoid getting caught - and even helped an escaped convict.

Batmaz, who had worked for the Met since 2007, was earning up to £1,000 a week drug dealing on the side.

He is now facing life behind bars after pleading guilty to dealing drugs, conspiracy to steal and abusing his position.

He will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court tomorrow, along with eight others linked with the scam.

Prosecutor David Durose told Southwark Crown Court today that Batmaz abused his position for ‘his own selfish profit’.

‘This case arises out of an investigation into the extensive criminal activities of a serving PCSO called Oguz Batmaz,’ he said.

‘Batmaz's primary criminality was that he serially abused his position of trust as a PCSO.

‘He used his access to police databases 
for his own selfish profit, selling sensitive information and sharing 
data with criminal associates, thereby assisting the criminals to the 
detriment of the public.'

The prosecutor added: ‘His
misconduct involved him carrying out unlawful checks on police computer
systems on behalf of his associates and supplying those associates with
information so obtained.

‘He
was also involved in the identification of cannabis factories from 
police intelligence databases and the subsequent relaying of the details
of such addresses in order that they might be the target of theft

In court: Batmaz conducted searches on names and addresses linked to the boyfriend of Emma Tooke (left), who was a crack cocaine dealer. His friend Kadir Ozresberoglu (right), a drug dealer, was caught on tape with the PCSO

‘As the investigation progressed it became apparent that not only was Batmaz exploiting his position as a PCSO, he was also a cocaine dealer and a regular user of both cocaine and cannabis.’

The court heard that Batmaz, who was based at the Mottingham and Chislehurst Safer Neighbourhood Office, began carrying out unlawful checks on associates, including his cousin, just months after he started.

The police launched an anti-corruption investigation in 2010 and bugged his home and his place of work.

He
was heard talking about meeting ‘geezers’ for drug deals and being paid
a 'bag of sand' - Cockney rhyming slang for 'grand', or £1,000 - a 
week.

In one recording, before his associates raided a cannabis factory, Batmaz even boasted he was doing other dealers a favour by moving the drugs before police had a chance to seize them.

‘See the way I look at it, I'm doing these boys a favour,' he said.

‘Coming up on the system they're obviously gonna (sic) get raided at one point, so I am just raiding them before they get raided.'

Referred to as their 'copper friend', the PCSO even helped convict Wayne Farrell, who was serving a six-year stretch for conspiracy to supply crack cocaine, stay on the run after he escaped from prison.

The court heard that Batmaz conducted a number of searches on names and addresses linked to Farrell while he stayed with girlfriend, Emma Tooke, who is also in the dock, to avoid the pair getting caught.

Crew: Batmaz and his gang must wait until tomorrow to hear their fate at Southwark Crown Court

By April 2010 the police were aware of the PCSO's activities and placed an entry about Farrell on the database to see how Batmaz reacted.

Three minutes later records show he phoned Farrell to pass on the information.

And two months before the gang were arrested, Batmaz was heard joking that his flat might be bugged.

He said: ‘If there's recorders in here we'd be f***** a long time ago.’

His drug dealer friend, Kadir Ozresberoglu, 26, continued the joke by saying: ‘Yeah, they're building one up on us, building big one up on us.’

The pair were arrested at Batmaz's flat in New Eltham, south east London, in June 2010.

As they were raided Ozresberoglu, of Sidcup, Kent, tried to throw the cocaine out of the bedroom window, while Batmaz appeared to be in distress and was asking for water.

The prosecutor added: ‘The crown suggests that he had swallowed the packets of drugs that were already made up.’

Drugs paraphernalia including scales, cannabis grinders and mixing agents were also found in the property.

Batmaz will be sentenced along with drug dealing friends Ozresberoglu, Filipe De Frietas, 26, Lee Hession,30, Anthony Noble, 30, Aaron Eastwood, 32, and his cousin Ayhan Mustafa, 30.

Escaped convict Wayne Farrell, 35, and his girlfriend Emma Tooke, 33, will also be sentenced.

The court heard Batmaz worked for Bexley Council in south east London, helping elderly people with IT skills before joining the Met in 2003.

His barrister, James Hines said: 'This was his misguided attempt to impress others and make him seem more important and interesting than perhaps he was.'
