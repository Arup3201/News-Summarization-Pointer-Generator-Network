When Liverpool’s players begin their lap of honour on Sunday, the chances are they will be left wondering what might have been.

But they cannot lose sight of their achievements over the past 10 months. Liverpool have had an outstanding season and for long periods were the best team in the land. And who knows, if Manchester City suffer an unexpected slip, they could yet be crowned champions.

The likelihood, however, is that there will be no trophy, as was the case in 2002 and 2009 when the club last mounted a challenge for the Premier League title. Those were the best Liverpool teams I played in but does anyone remember that? No. Why? We didn’t win anything.

Everyone remembers the team who won the Champions League in Istanbul nine years ago, but they were nowhere near as good as the side Brendan Rodgers has put together in this campaign, a side who have scored goals for fun and won 11 consecutive Premier League games.

Do not underestimate how much of Liverpool’s improved form is down to Rodgers. Unlike the managers at Chelsea and Manchester City, he hasn’t been shopping at the top end, paying huge fees and huge wages; Rodgers’ success comes from endless hours coaching on the training ground.

Look at the number of players who have improved: Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge have come on so much, you would expect them to start when England face Italy at the World Cup, and Jon Flanagan could also get a seat on the plane if there are injuries this weekend.

Even Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez have benefited; Steven has excelled in a new, deep-lying midfield role, while Suarez’s form going up another level owes a lot to his tactically-aware manager.

Liverpool have flourished thanks to Rodgers, not because Fenway Sports Group have emulated Sheik Mansour and Roman Abramovich.

In the two campaigns in which I came closest to the title, we needed two or three quality signings to make the next step, but the subsequent transfer windows were filled with poor signings as Gerard Houllier, Rafa Benitez and their scouts made mistakes that  prevented us from pushing on.

Houllier, for instance, rejected the chance to sign Nicolas Anelka after a successful loan spell in 2002. Nicolas helped us get to 80 points but Houllier instead bought the Senegalese pair Salif Diao and El Hadji Diouf, as well as the France midfielder Bruno Cheyrou, for more than £20million.

Diouf scored twice on his Anfield debut against Southampton but that was a rare highlight. After initial training sessions, you hoped nerves were holding them back, but within a few months it was clear they wouldn’t improve us. We ended up finishing fifth, with 64 points.

It was a similar situation in 2009. Benitez sold Xabi Alonso and bought the injured Alberto Aquilani; Sami Hyypia left and was replaced by Sotirios Kyrgiakos; the situation was also aggravated as the signings that had been made in the summer of 2008 were not up to standard, either.

People such as Philipp Degen, Andriy Voronin, Andrea Dossena and David N’Gog had rarely played as we fought it out with Manchester United but in 2009-10, when injuries and suspensions kicked in, they were found wanting when we needed them to step up.

Back in 2009, Liverpool looked at bringing Michael Owen back to Anfield; Everton were interested, too, but Manchester United unexpectedly moved in and Michael told me about a revealing conversation he’d had with Sir Alex Ferguson.

You might have thought Ferguson would have been worried about us bridging a four-point deficit, but he said to Michael he couldn’t see Liverpool having it in them to go again and that Chelsea were United’s biggest obstacle. He was right. Chelsea won the title, we finished seventh with 63 points.

So now is where things become complicated for the modern Liverpool and many will wonder — me included — if they have it in them to go again should they miss out. It is essential the moves they make once the window opens are right.

Look at last summer’s signings. The big money buys, Simon Mignolet and Mamadou Sakho, have done OK but need to improve, while the rest — Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto, Victor Moses and Aly Cissokho — failed to contribute. What difference would they have made if they had been a success?

Moses and Cissokho, who came on loan, will go back to their parent clubs, but if Aspas and Alberto stay they will have to start making a difference, as Liverpool’s workload will be increased with the Champions League to factor in.

Liverpool don’t need a summer where they buy players to fit in around the edges. They need quality additions. They need three players to go straight into the team — two defenders and a midfielder  — then another striker and a wide player to add depth and quality.

We hear a lot about the transfer committee who work behind the scenes at Anfield but however the system operates, the owners need to back Rodgers financially and trust his judgment to bring in the quality that will prevent a repeat of what happened after 2002 and 2009.

Brendan, his scouting team and the owners need to learn the lessons from the mistakes that were made in the past and ensure this campaign is a springboard for future  success rather than the summit of ambitions.

It took Houllier and Benitez four seasons to make a title challenge but Rodgers has done it in two, in a more entertaining style, albeit with the help of having no European football.

Whatever happens this weekend, Liverpool now have to challenge for the title year in, year out.
