Police believe they have identified a Twitter user who posted a sickening tweet racially abusing Arsenal goal hero Danny Welbeck.

Officers from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) launched a probe into a message posted after the former Manchester United striker returned to Old Trafford and scored the winner in the Gunners' 2-1 FA Cup Quarter Final victory on Monday night.

The vile, racist rant, tweeted by user @angeIsleftfoot, read: 'Welbeck is dead to me, the f****** c***…’

The tweet continued with sickening references that are deemed too offensive to publish here.

Sportsmail understands officers in Manchester with specialist training in social media identified the user and passed on the information to Wiltshire Police, who confirmed they have now picked up the case.

The account was no longer active on Wednesday.

A complaint was made by another Twitter user and officers will now decide whether the tweet constitutes a hate crime.

The vitriolic slur was one of a number of disturbing messages posted in the aftermath of Welbeck's triumphant return to United

Some stated that they hoped the 24-year-old, who is from Manchester, would die while one user threatened to kill him.

Welbeck was shown the door by United boss Louis van Gaal last year, who claimed he was not good enough.

He seized upon a poor backpass to give Arsenal a lead they would not relinquish and then celebrated in front of the 9,000 visiting supporters - an action which was welcomed by many pundits.

Despite isolated boos, Welbeck was applauded from the field by the majority of United fans when he was substituted in the 74th minute.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'Following the appearance of a racist tweet aimed at a former Manchester United player, which was placed on social media on Monday evening, Wiltshire Police can confirm that they are currently investigating this matter.'
