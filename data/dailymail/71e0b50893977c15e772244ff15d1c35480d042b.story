A fast-food restaurant manager has been taken to court and fined - for dropping a cigarette butt down a drain.

Dave Jode, 29, nipped outside for a smoke during his shift at a Burger King in Truro, Cornwall.

But he was spotted dropping his cigarette into a storm drain by officers from Cornwall Council.

Furious: Dave Jode, 29, a restaurant manager for Burger King has been taken to court and fined - for dropping a cigarette butt down a drain. This is a file picture of a Burger King

Mr Jode refused to pay a £50 fixed penalty notice and the case eventually ended up in Truro Magistrates Court where he was fined £100 for littering.

Mr Jode was also ordered to pay £100 towards the council’s legal bill - which ran to a total of £666.

Speaking afterwards Mr Jode, of Threemilestone, Cornwall, said he will not pay his fine because the prosecution was 'ridiculous'.

He said: 'How are you supposed to know that putting a butt down a drain isillegal?

'It is a ridiculous penalty for someone who picks rubbish up all the time. Isweep the streets here myself.'

Brian Keast, one of the council officials from the public health and protection department, who witnessed the littering, said:

'Mr Jode was arrogant. It took a police officer and PCSO to deal with thesituation.

'Littering is a crime, albeit low level, but it is a serious problem.'

Burger King said it was looking into the incident on October 26 last year.
