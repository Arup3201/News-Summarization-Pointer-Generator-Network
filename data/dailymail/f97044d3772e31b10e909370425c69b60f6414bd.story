A father of four young children called police to say he had killed his wife and was going to take his own life - and when authorities arrived, they found both parents dead.

David Scott Donaldson, 37, apparently shot his wife, Shaniel Kaye Donaldson, 32, multiple times at their home in Price, Utah early on Sunday morning before turning the gun on himself, police said.

Their children, a 13-year-old girl, an 11-year-old boy and twin seven-year-old girls, were also in the house at the time but were not harmed. The children heard a commotion but did not see the killings.

Price Police Chief Kevin Drolc said that Mr Donaldson had been struggling with depression and deteriorating physical health, while relatives said the couple had been having marital problems.

Donaldson called the Price City Police Department just before 3 a.m. on Sunday to raise the alarm, and its officers were joined by personnel from the Carbon County Sheriff's Department, Utah Highway Patrol and 
Helper Police at the scene.

As officers tried to contact the husband and wife, they spoke with the children over the phone and were able to give them instructions to get them out safely, Police Capt. William Barnes told Fox 13.

A SWAT team entered the residence and the couple's bodies were found in the master bedroom.

The children are now in the custody of their grandparents and Donaldson's aunt told KSL that 'it's not going to be easy for them'.

Loss: Mrs Donaldson, a nurse, was found next to her husband in the master bedroom of their home

She added that the couple had some marital problems in recent years, but they would never have expected the murder-suicide.

'Last
night [relatives] were in contact with them and things seemed to be 
okay,' she said. 'But what happened between then and 3 o'clock in the 
morning we just don't know.'

Donaldson had recently left his job at the Price Youth Detention Center because of health reasons.

'Depression and marital problems are the 
likely contributing factors to this,' Chief Drolc told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'There also 
were some employment issues and disability issues for Mr. Donaldson.'

Family: The children, aged 13, 11 and seven-year-old twins, are now staying with their grandparents

With Mummy: Hours before her death, Shaniel was making playdate plans with a friend on Facebook

Mr Donaldson appears to have written on a Facebook photo of his family just hours before pulling the trigger.

'This was when I was 60 lbs heavier but that is ok,' he wrote in the early hours of Sunday. 'I still love the family pic.'

His wife, believed to be a nurse, was
also using the site before her death, telling one friend she would call
her in the morning as they made plans to play with the Donaldsons' new 
puppy.

Drolc said that the deaths have been ruled an apparent murder-suicide, pending autopsies.

Court records show that Mrs Donaldson Shaniel filed a cohabitant abuse case against her husband in 2005. The case was dismissed just days later, the Tribune reported.

According to the National Domestic Violence Fatality Review Initiative, between 2003 and 2008, a third of domestic violence homicide suspects killed themselves after murdering their partners

They often had a history of domestic violence, access to a gun, had previously made threats, and had poor mental health or substance abuse issues. 92.6 percent of the suspects were men.
