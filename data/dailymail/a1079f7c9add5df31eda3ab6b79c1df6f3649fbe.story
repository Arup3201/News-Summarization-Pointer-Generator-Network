A Utah soldier has been awarded the fifth-highest combat medal six years after he was hit by a bomb in Iraq that left him with permanent brain damage and unable to return to war.

Joshua Hansen, a 42-year-old father of two, was hit a total of nine times by improvised explosive devices during his two deployments to Iraq, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

It was the ninth hit, which happened on March 15, 2007, that knocked him out of the service.

As he speaks to a gathering at the Veterans Hospital after receiving a Bronze Star for his service in Iraq, Sgt. Joshua Hansen is embraced by his children Jessie James, age 6, and Trinity Rose, age 9 in Salt Lake City

He was driving the lead vehicle during a
 route-clearing mission in Zaidon, Iraq, when an IED exploded underneath
 his vehicle. The vehicle was damaged, but he and his squad leader 
decided to continue on.

'We were OK, but we knew we needed to get out of there before we were attacked again,' he told the Standard-Examiner.

A short time later, the truck ran over three anti-tank mines stacked on top of one another.

'It lifted the vehicle off the ground,' he told the Standard-Examiner. 'I don’t remember anything after that. All I can remember is being on a chopper on the way to the hospital.'

Hansen suffered traumatic brain injuries that affected his memory.

His mother has been pushing for the government to award her son the Bronze Star in the six years since the explosion. 

Finally, at the request of Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, Hansen was awarded the medal on Tuesday.

'By willingly traveling on the most 
dangerous and IED-laded routes … Sgt. Hansen saved an untold amount of 
lives and military equipment,' wrote his commander, Eric Coulson, then 
an Army captain, in his narrative supporting him as a recipient for the 
Bronze Star in 2007. Hansen’s 'loyalty, honor and personal courage kept 
his soldiers’ motivation high and fears low.'

Hansen choked up as he accepted the medal. 

'I didn’t serve this country for a medal,' he said, according to the Tribune. 'I served this country for my boys, all the men I served with.

'For my mother, that wasn’t good enough,' he added, referring to his mother's requests for him to receive the Bronze Star.

Hansen signed up for the military shortly after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. He served two deployments in Iraq. During his second deployment, he was the team leader for a platoon that cleared roads of bombs.
