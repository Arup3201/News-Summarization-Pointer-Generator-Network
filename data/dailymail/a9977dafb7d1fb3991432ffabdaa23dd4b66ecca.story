A judge has criticised police for not prosecuting four thugs involved in a ‘vicious’ assault – allegedly because none of them speaks English.

The French teenagers who descended on a man ‘like a pack of wolves’ were instead given fixed penalties and released.

By contrast, a local man who was less heavily involved in the altercation was hauled to court and jailed.

The decision was criticised by the judge who accused the police of 
‘clearing their books with the minimum of effort’.

District Judge John 
Foster said: ‘It is extraordinary that the police decided to deal with 
the others whose behaviour was more serious by issuing fixed penalty 
tickets because, apparently, four of them did not speak English.

‘I cannot begin to understand how the police reached their conclusion.’

The allegation – denied by police – was made as Anthony Hilton, 22, 
appeared in court over the incident in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

His 
solicitor told the hearing he was ‘concerned as a council taxpayer’ over
the disparity in how those involved had been treated.

District Judge Foster spoke out yesterday after being shown CCTV of the 
incident showing the Frenchmen he described as ‘vicious cowards’ joining
in the attack.

However, while Hilton was charged, the Frenchmen were given £80 fixed 
penalty notices, along with a local woman.

John Jones, representing 
Hilton, said his client had retaliated after the unnamed victim hit him.

‘At no time did Mr Hilton expect the incident to develop in the way that it did,’ Mr Jones told Barnsley magistrates.

‘The others acted more seriously than Mr Hilton.’

Rose Carr, prosecuting, had described how Hilton, of Barnsley, had 
punched the victim on the head and spun him on to the floor during the 
incident in May.

Hilton admitted threatening behaviour and failing to 
surrender to bail and was jailed for 16 weeks.

After the case his mother, Gale, said: ‘He was not expecting to go to 
prison. If the others have got off then it is harsh. Does the crime fit 
the punishment?’

His girlfriend Gemma Keer, 23, claimed they had been leaving a nightclub
together when someone punched him for no reason.

She said: ‘He knocked 
him down and these French lads, who we didn’t know, came up.’

She claims that the Frenchmen said in broken English, ‘we saw what 
happened before’, then waded in.

She added: ‘Tony only threw one punch 
but the French lads were really giving the guy on the ground a kicking.’

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police denied language had been a factor
in the decision and said Crown Prosecution Service guidelines had been 
followed.

The Frenchmen, two aged 18, one 17 and one 16, had no previous convictions and were therefore fined, he insisted.

The same applied to a 23-year-old woman arrested over the attack, 
whereas Hilton had ‘extensive’ previous offences and was ‘heavily 
involved’.

The spokesman added: ‘Fixed penalty notices were not issued because of nationality or their ability to speak English.’

Hilton plans to appeal against his sentence.
