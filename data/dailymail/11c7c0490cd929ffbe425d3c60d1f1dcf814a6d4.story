The families of three runaway schoolgirls who fled to Syria to join ISIS have issued a new appeal for their 'beloved' daughters to return home immediately.

Describing their loss as 'more acute' on Mother's Day, the families of Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana, said they were praying for the 'immediate, safe return' of their children.

The teenage jihadi brides, who all attended Bethnal Green Academy in east London, are believed to have joined terror group ISIS after leaving the UK last month.

But the families today pledged to do 'everything possible' to ensure the girls returned back safely. 

In the joint statement, they said: 'We, the families of missing schoolgirls, pray for the immediate safe return of our beloved daughters. We feel our loss more acutely on Mothers-Day as we look over to their beds and see only the spaces left behind by them.

'We will continue to do everything we possibly can to ensure our girls are brought back to us safely.' 

The families also used the statement to again lash out at authorities, suggesting the school, Met Police and the local authority 'failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information'.

They said: 'As parents, we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care.

'Had we been made aware of circumstances sooner, we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the UK.'  

The schoolgirls are understood to now be in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK last month. 

The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police Commissioner (pictured at the Home Affairs Select Committee) said that, with the benefit of hindsight, officers should have communicated directly with the families 

They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria. 

They are believed to be staying with Sharmeena Begum, the fellow pupil from their school who went missing in December.

Sharmeena Begum, the first of the schoolgirls to go to Syira, is thought to be in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa

The 15-year-old student, the first of the four to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, had not been identified by the authorities but was named this week. 

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has admitted that 'with the benefit of hindsight' officers should have communicated directly with the families.

But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology.

However, the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers' actions when they appeared before a committee of MPs earlier this month.

Instead, they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children's potential radicalisation.

They were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. 

The country's top police officer was later forced to apologise to the families over a misplaced letter relating to Sharmeena's disappearance, apologising that it 'didn't get through'. 

The  letter had been given to the three pupils instead of being sent directly to the parents, after the girl were spoken to by police as potential witnesses after she went missing. 

However, senior figures, led by David Cameron, have previously insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs.

'Everyone has a role to play,' said the Prime Minister.

Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond echoed the comments saying: 'Parents have responsibilities, schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators.'   

'We, the families of missing schoolgirls , pray for the immediate safe return of our beloved daughters. We feel our loss more acutely on Mothers-Day as we look over to their beds and see only the spaces left behind by them.

'As you can imagine, the last few weeks have been incredibly difficult. We would like to thank the public for their generosity of spirit and support in this most trying of times.

'With respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school, Met police and the local authority, all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other.

'As parents, we expect the safeguarding of our children to be the top priority of schools and the local authority whilst our children are in their care. Had we been made aware of circumstances sooner, we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the UK.

'We note and appreciate Tower Hamlets Council's very recent attempt to educate parents with respect to such dangers with a pamphlet on radicalisation and extremism. Likewise, we appreciate the police's apology with respect to their mishandling. We hope other families won't have to bear the same pain that we are enduring at the moment, and that lessons are learned from our experience.

'Looking to the future, we hope to work with the relevant authorities to rectify the situation, and we will continue to do everything we possibly can to ensure our girls are brought back to us safely.'
