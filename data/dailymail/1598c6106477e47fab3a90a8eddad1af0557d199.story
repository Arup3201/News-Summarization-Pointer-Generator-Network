Law enforcement in Los Angeles have been left stunned after they discovered photographs on social media showing young children holding AK-47's during a massive crackdown on the notorious Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips gang.

In one of the shocking images a young girl in Disney pajamas brandishes the iconic Russian assault rifle, pointing the barrel right at the camera - while in another, a little boy holds a hand gun towards the lens.

Recovered during a massive raid on Thursday across South LA, almost 1,000 members of the LAPD and the FBI took about three dozen members of the dangerous gang into custody as they attempt to stem crime across the city.

'It's a culture of violence,' said LAPD Commander, Bill Scott. 'When you grow up in a culture like that, violence becomes secondary. It becomes second nature. And that's the cycle we're trying to disrupt.'

The 30 or so gang members arrested on drug and conspiracy charges are the culmination of Operation Thumbs Down, which has been in the pipeline for 18 months and targeted the Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips leaders.

The investigation's name directly refers to the Rollin' 30s hand gesture - two thumbs pointed up, representing the 'H' in Harlem.

Notorious across the south of LA, the gang has around 1,000 members and is thought to be responsible for up to 29 murders over the course of the last five years according to the LAPD.

In addition, the gang is thought to have perpetrated around 1,100 robberies and over a thousand assaults in the 1.5 square-mile area that makes up the gang's area according to the LA Times.

'Among the Bloods and the Crips gangs, the Rollin' 30s are among the more sophisticated,' said Assistant U.S. Attorney, Christopher Pelham.

According to federal investigators, the Rollin' 30s has three distinct branches - 'The Avenues', 'Denker Park' and '39th Street'.

However, law enforcement authorities have said that they believe the gangs activity is spreading beyond South LA.

Weapons: A large amount of illegal firearms were also recovered during the raid - which took place on Thursday across South LA

Haul: Narcotics were also brought in by law enforcement as they cracked down on the Crips gang across the city

'We’ve traced them up into Simi Valley, up into Van Nuys, different parts of the city,' said FBI Special Agent in Charge Timothy Delaney.

'So they’re not only preying on their local community, they’re starting to spread out and preying on different areas of Los Angeles.'

And in addition to the federal and drug and gang conspiracy charges, the task force served 34 search warrants, seizing guns and drugs.

When asked about how much money this gang generated, federal authorities were not able to give an exact answer, but they believe this operation might be generating $1 million to $2 million a year.

City Attorney Mike Feuer said that his office will continue to take civil actions against gang-controlled locations in Los Angeles.

'These actions say to the owner of a property, 'We need you to take steps to get gang members out of your properties, we need you to take steps to ensure your properties are safe.'

If convicted, the 35 defendants will face mandatory to prison terms of 5-10 years and maximum penalties of 20 to 30 years in federal prisons.

The defendants were scheduled to make appearances in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday and Friday.

Among those arrested and federally charged were 34-year-old, Jovan Harris, aka 'Headache' and Moses Williams, 34, aka 'Termite'.

This case is the result of an investigation by members of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Task Force on Violent Gangs, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Los Angeles Police Department; the United States Attorney’s Office; and the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office.
