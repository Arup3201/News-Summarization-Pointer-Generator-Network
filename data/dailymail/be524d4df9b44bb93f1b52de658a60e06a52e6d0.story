These incredible pictures show a lightning storm above the city of Houston, Texas, from a very unusual perspective - the edge of space.

The stills are from a Vime - a short Twitter video - posted by Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman, 38, who is aboard the International Space Station in low earth orbit.

It shows the awesome power of a storm over the city from above and was posted on Friday. The rapid-fire flashes can be seen through the dense mass of clouds.

Earlier this month Wiseman, another U.S. astronaut Steve Swanson, and German astronaut Alexander Gerst, showed off their microgravity football skills by performing impressive bicycle kicks, spins and somersaults while kicking a ball.

Wiseman, from Baltimore, Maryland, has taken over the mantle of incredible ISS social media posts from Commander Chris Hadfield, who posted on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr to a large following of people around the world.

Hadfield, a keen musician, was even filmed performing David Bowie's Space Oddity in low gravity and performed a duet with Canadian band Barenaked Ladies via a video feed from space.

Reid Wiseman, of Baltimore, Maryland, arrived at the space station on May 28 as part of the Expedition 40/41 crew.

They are scheduled to spend the next several months living and working in space until they return to Earth in November 2014.

Before takeoff, Wiseman's wife Carroll and their two daughters bid him an emotional goodbye, knowing they won't see him until November.

According to his profie on NASA's website, Wiseman graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1997 and reported to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training.

He was designated as a Naval Aviator in 1999 and transferred to Fighter Squadron 101 at the Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia.

While there he made two deployments to the Middle East, and was selected for the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School.

After graduating he was transferred to the Naval Air Station in Patuxent River, Maryland, where his earned his masters degree and worked various flight test programmes.

He was deployed to South America and then back to the Naval Air Station Oceana as a fighter pilot, before being selected for astronaut training.
