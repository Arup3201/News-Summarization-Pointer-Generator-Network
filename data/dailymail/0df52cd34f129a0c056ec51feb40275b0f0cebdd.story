The BBC lost £100million in a disastrous takeover of the Lonely Planet travel guide business, an internal report has revealed.

In a damning analysis, the corporation’s governing body accused its commercial arm BBC Worldwide of getting ‘carried away’ with ‘highly optimistic’ plans to buy the struggling brand six years ago.

It was forced to sell the business to US-based company NC2 Media at a huge loss earlier this year, prompting an internal inquiry.

Mistake: The BBC lost £100million in a disastrous takeover of the Lonely Planet travel guide business

Waste: The loss is £20million more than was previously thought because BBC Worldwide continued to inject funds into Lonely Planet despite the fact it failed to generate the expected profits

The full scale of the waste is £20million more than was previously thought because BBC Worldwide continued to inject funds into Lonely Planet despite the fact it failed to generate the expected profits.

The BBC Trust report criticised the Worldwide division for being ‘too aggressive’ in its forecasts, saying the potential for the travel guide to succeed as an online venture was ‘unproven’.

Review: Diane Coyle, vice-chairman of the BBC Trust, said: ¿Mistakes were made in the acquisition and handling of Lonely Planet'

It added: ‘[BBC Worldwide] seemed to get carried away with the deal momentum and there should have been an effective mechanism in place to ensure that it did not end up over-paying.

‘Not enough downside analysis was done of the potential impact of a faster decline in books and of not achieving the very optimistic online forecasts.’

Lonely Planet was acquired for £132million when John Smith was head of BBC Worldwide. He left to become chief operating officer of Burberry last year with an £800,000 payoff.

BBC Worldwide paid for the firm - set up in 1973 by English engineer Tony Wheeler and his wife Maureen - in two chunks in 2007 and 2011.

It invested a further £20million in the business before selling it this year for £52million.

Diane Coyle, vice-chairman of the BBC Trust, said: ‘Mistakes were made in the acquisition and handling of Lonely Planet.

'The important thing now is that the lessons highlighted by this review are implemented, alongside broader improvements to the strategy and oversight of the BBC’s commercial operations.

‘It is important to view the significant financial loss from Lonely Planet against the backdrop of a sustained strong performance from BBC Worldwide as a whole, which brings significant benefits to licence fee payers.’
