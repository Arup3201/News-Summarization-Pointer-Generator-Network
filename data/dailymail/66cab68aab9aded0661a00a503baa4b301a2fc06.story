Nevada has passed an 'historic' bill making it legal to play online poker within the state and with other players across the country.

The legislature, Bill AB114, was passed unanimously in both  the Assembly and Senate on Thursday before it was signed into law by Governor Brian Sandoval.

While the legislation ruled that interstate gambling is now allowed, players from across the country will only be able to play legally once Nevada makes agreements with individual states.

The federal Department of Justice has
previously cracked down on sites that let people illegally gamble across states, but Sandoval said he was 
confident Nevada was on firm legal footing.

'Historic day': Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, surrounded by state lawmakers in the state's Old Assembly Chambers, signs AB114 legalizing online gambling in Nevada on Thursday

On Thursday, he promised to communicate with the Department of Justice on the language of the agreements made between states.

Exactly how the federal government will react to the legislation following its major crackdowns on online gambling sites in the past is yet to be seen.

In April 2011, the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office shut down three of the biggest internet poker sites and charged the owners with fraud, money laundering and illegal gambling.

The poker companies - including big sites such as PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker - were all based overseas and argued they operate outside the reach of U.S. law, but 11 defendants were accused of the charges.

Should online poker be legalized in every state of America?

The Nevada bill had been declared an 
emergency measure and the process had been somewhat hurried as Nevada 
rushed to beat New Jersey Chris Christie, who could sign a similar 
legislation next week.

AB114 keeps Nevada at the front of the
gambling market, legalizing online gambling for the first time in the 
state and potentially netting it millions of dollars in licensing and 
other fees.

'This is an historic day for the great 
state of Nevada,' Sandoval said, flanked by state lawmakers. 'Today I sign into law the framework that will usher in the next 
frontier of gaming in Nevada.'

Sandoval, a former chairman of the 
Nevada Gaming Commission added, 'This bill is critical to our state's 
economy and ensures that we will continue to be the gold standard for 
gaming regulation.'

The
Wire Act had previously made gambling across state lines illegal, but 
in 2011 the Court of Appeals ruled this only applied to sports betting.

Law: The bill makes interstate online poker legal for the first time - once other states compact with Nevada

New frontier: The bill will change the landscape of gambling and some fear the impact on smaller casinos

The ruling put Nevada in position to legalize internet 
gambling if the federal government sanctioned it - but when those efforts
failed in Congress, Sandoval said Nevada would work toward agreements 
with other states.

For the bill to reach its potential, Nevada still has to convince other states to partner with it, but officials are reportedly confident that this will not be any issue.

Partnering with other states gives 
Nevada an expanded customer market and provides other states with 
Nevada's expertise in gambling regulation.

Pete Ernaut, a lobbyist representing the Nevada Resort Association, said expanding the customer base was key.

'It's imperative for the success of 
this that we compact with other states because we don't have a universe 
of players,' Ernaut said.

The benefit for other states, he said, is Nevada's 'most mature regulatory infrastructure'.

'We
have the most mature financial, auditing and collection capabilities, 
much greater than some of those states, and they have the players,' he 
said.

Beating him to it: The bill was rushed through in Nevada after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured, indicated he could sign a similar legislation next week

AG Burnett, chairman of the Nevada 
Gaming Control Board, said the state already has about 20 applications 
from operators, equipment and software vendors to be licensed for online
gambling.

One Assemblyman, Ira Hansen, voted for the bill but voiced his concern for smaller casinos in Reno, Sparks and Nevada's outback who could be hurt by the bill, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported.

'The smaller casinos in the state, 
especially in Northern Nevada, which are already hurting,' he said. 'I'm hoping 
this is actually going to be beneficial to them and pick up some new 
(business). I just wanted to get on the record that is my concern, for 
the little guy in this whole argument.'

But supporters of the bill 
argued that those casinos too will have the opportunity to enter into 
agreements with compacts in other states

The bill means Nevada beat 
New Jersey, its East Coast casino rival. Gov. Chris Christie had 
previously vetoed an online wagering bill but indicated he may sign an 
amended version next week.
