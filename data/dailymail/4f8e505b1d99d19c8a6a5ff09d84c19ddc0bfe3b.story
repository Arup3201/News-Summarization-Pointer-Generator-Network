Sam Burgess scored his first try in rugby union to help Bath academy beat London Irish A 44-5 in an A League game on Monday.

The 26-year-old crossed just before  half time  to put Bath 20-0 up by the break, and played 63 minutes in the comfortable win at the Rec.

Burgess, Sportsmail's new columnist, switched codes from rugby league in October and has made four first-team appearances for Bath, mainly at centre, with his debut against Harlequins last month.
