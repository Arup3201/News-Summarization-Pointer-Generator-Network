Family doctors are the most accident-prone drivers in Britain, a study has found. 

Health workers such as GPs, nurses and dentists make up eight of the top ten professions for car crashes.

Experts suggest the stressful nature of the jobs that make up most of the top accident prone professions could explain why health counsellors, nurses and dentists all feature on the list.

In the study, GPs claimed the number one spot - with almost a third (29 per cent) making at least one car insurance claim in the past five years.

The proportion of those with a claim was not only the highest of any occupation in the UK, but more than double the national average for all professions (13 per cent).

And it is not just GPs dishing out bad medicine on the roads.

The overwhelming majority of drivers with claims worked in the medical profession, holding eight of the top 10 spots and making up 75 per cent of the top 20.

While those working in health care are racking up claims, the safest occupation on the road was car dealers, with only three per cent of drivers in the profession making a claim in the past five years. 

Other occupations less likely to make a claim included bar staff, van drivers, painters, plasterers, tattoo artists and professional footballers. 

Professor Andrew Smith, an expert on occupational and health psychology from Cardiff University, said: 'Healthcare is typically considered a highly stressful occupation, which could explain why GPs and other health professionals seem to make more insurance claims than others.

1. GP - 29 per cent

2. Hospital consultant - 26 per cent

3. Clinical psychologist - 25 per cent

4. Drug addiction counsellor - 25 per cent

5. Probation officer - 24 per cent

6. Dentist - 24 per cent

7. Health visitor - 24 per cent

8. Community nurse - 24 per cent

9. Hospital manager - 23 per cent

10. Town planner - 23 per cent

'Stress can dramatically affect a person's health and cognitive functions. For instance, if you are having a particularly stressful day, you may find that you become absent minded when it comes to day to day activities and find it difficult to concentrate on tasks.

'You might even find that you become especially clumsy at times. This is due to the effect stress can have on the brain, and while this can be serious in any context, it is an especially bad combination while behind the wheel.

'Typically, the types of accidents that are attributed to stress tend to be relatively minor bumps, caused by lapses in concentration whilst driving.'

Lee Griffin, of online brokers Gocompare, said: 'It's interesting to see an apparent trend when it comes to occupations and accidents, with such a large proportion of drivers with claims working in the medical profession.

'It would appear that a stressful job is a common link between drivers with a high proportion of claims, and that these accidents are due to distraction or breaks in concentration while on the road rather than reckless driving. It's ironic that GPs having their mind on the patients while driving could result in them needing medical attention themselves.

'This study highlights the importance of being in the right state of mind while behind the wheel.

Driving when stressed or angry can lead to accidents, so if you find yourself particularly frustrated, it might be a good idea to take some time to calm down before driving, or find a safe place to pull over for a while until you are in the right frame of mind to continue your journey.'
