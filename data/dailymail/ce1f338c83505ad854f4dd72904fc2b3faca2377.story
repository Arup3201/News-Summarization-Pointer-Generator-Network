A lioness in Zimbabwe has broken the world record by giving birth to eight cubs in one litter, despite being on a contraceptive pill.

Named Pasha, she gave birth on 
November 4 at the Lion and Cheetah Park on the outskirts of Harare, Zimbabwe.

She had already given birth to two cubs earlier this 
year, and had been immediately put on the pill to control her breeding, so the arrival of eight cubs was a surprise to staff.

Extraordinary: Pasha, pictured, already gave birth to two cubs earlier this year and was given the contraceptive pill to control her breeding

Lionesses are known to give birth to two cubs at a time and occasionally four and vets are now wondering if the contraceptive administered backfired.

Now after giving birth to such a sizeable brood Pasha is now receiving 
some extra nutrition to boost her health, reported New Zimbabwe.

Parks officials only announced the extraordinary birth this week and the young cubs are being looked after by staff at the zoo.

One zoo worker said: 'We are suckling them from the bottle each time they wake up from sleep. They still need a lot of milk and warmth and we are keeping an eye on them every minute.'

Fragile load: Dr Hillary Madzikanda, the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority's head of scientific services, described the litter of eight as 'an achievement'

Dr Hillary Madzikanda, the Zimbabwe 
National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority's head of scientific 
services said: 'This has never happened in the history of lions, the 
world over. It is actually a world record.

'Normally, you get two cubs per 
litter and getting four is even very lucky. This one is a record. It is 
an achievement for this lioness.

It is not rare for wildlife sanctuaries to administer contraceptive pills or injections as a birth control method.

In July, a lioness at a zoo in northeast China gave birth to a litter of six cubs, in what was hailed as a national record.
