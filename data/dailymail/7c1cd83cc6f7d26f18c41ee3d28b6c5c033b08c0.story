Months after the five Lin family members were murdered in their Sydney home, their accused killer Robert Xie allegedly told his father-in-law: 'I hate you all to death'.

Grandfather Yang Fei Lin became heated at the Supreme Court on Wednesday as he recounted a series of conversations he had with his son-in-law Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie in the months after the murder of five family members in July 2009.

Speaking through an interpreter, Mr Lin stood up in the witness box and re-enacted the dispute, which he said took place in September 2009.

'Robert was really angry, jumped up and shouted "Why do you think there are two families now. I hate you all to death",' Mr Lin recalled.

Xie is accused of creeping into the home of his brother-in-law Min Lin and sister-in-law Lily Lin in North Epping in the early hours of July 18, 2009.

The crown says that, motivated by bitterness, Xie killed Min, Lily, the couple's two sons Henry, 12, and Terry, nine, and Lily's sister Irene, with a hammer-like weapon.

Mr Lin told the court that, by the end of 2009, a dispute had broken out about the guardianship of the surviving member of the family and assets of their dead son, newsagent Min Lin.

In this argument, Mr Lin said Xie 'got really angry' and questioned why he would not give any of the inheritance to his wife and Mr Lin's daughter Kathy.

At this point, Mr Lin said he and his wife Feng Qing Zhu reacted, saying: 'We are not dead yet. How can you fight over the assets with us'.

Mr Lin said he believed his son had assets totalling more than $2 million at the time of his death.

The court has previously heard Xie and Kathy had not worked steady jobs since moving to Sydney in 2005.

Mr Lin said he had told Xie prior to the murders that they weren't happy about that, to which he replied: 'Well everyone has their own different lifestyles'.

The court heard that in the year before Lily's death, Mr Lin found her diary that had a series of entries about a man called Rob.

'Having been trained by Rob these years, and lived with him 'together' made me a lot more familiar with him ... I hate to part with him,' she wrote in one entry.

Mr Lin said he confronted his daughter-in-law about it, saying 'my family does not have extra-marital affairs'.

He said Lily wouldn't tell him who Rob is, simply saying he was 'from the pyramid selling business'.

The court has previously heard that Lily suffered from a mild mental illness and would occasionally believe she was having affairs with men.

Xie has pleaded not guilty.

His trial continues.
