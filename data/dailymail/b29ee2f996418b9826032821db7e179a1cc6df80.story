Last week, Jose Mourinho claimed losing Nemanja Matic for Saturday's trip to Newcastle would be 'no problem'.

Unfortunately for the Chelsea faithful, their side fell to a 2-1 defeat at St James' Park without the suspended Serb, who had been one of seven ever-presents in the Premier League for the Blues so far this season.

Despite suffering their first loss of the season, Mourinho's side still sit three points clear at the top of the table, proving that consistent selection can be key with six players having started in each of Chelsea's 15 games so far.

Ronald Koeman's Southampton are the only other team to rival Chelsea's ever-present selection, with the Dutch boss also picking the same six players to start in each of his team's 14 outings. 

And it's no coincidence that these two teams sit first and fourth in the Premier League as we head into the busy Christmas period.

In his second spell as Blues boss, Mourinho looks intent on creating a solid spine, similar to the one that brought him so much success during his time in charge 10 years ago.

This time, rather than Petr Cech, John Terry, Claude Makelele, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba, it's Thibaut Courtois, Gary Cahill, Terry, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, whenever the Spain striker is available.

Chelsea would have also played the same backline in each game if it wasn't for Cesar Azpilicueta's red card against Crystal Palace which saw Filipe Luis deputise at Newcastle.

At Manchester United, Louis van Gaal would no doubt have loved to select the same set of players each week, but the Dutch boss has had to deal with a number of injuries to key players meaning only David de Gea has started each game.

Chelsea's Premier League title rivals Manchester City do not feature in the ever-present list as none of the squad have started in each of their 15 games.

The fact that Manuel Pellegrini's side still sit in second place, just three points behind leaders Chelsea, is testament to the strength in depth that City boss has at his disposal.

Arsenal also fail to feature in the list while Liverpool can only claim to have Simon Mignolet as their ever-present in goal.
