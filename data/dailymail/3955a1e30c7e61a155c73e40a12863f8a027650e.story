A U.S. Marine veteran jailed in Mexico on weapons charges for allegedly bringing guns across the border had his first court appearance on Wednesday after spending more than three months in a Mexican jail.

Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, 26, said he was headed to dinner in San Ysidro 
on March 31 when he mistakenly wound up at a border crossing point in 
Tijuana and accidentally traveled into Mexico.

At the time, Tahmooressi had firearms in his truck - the weapons were purchased legally in the U.S., but it is illegal to cross into Mexico with guns.

Mistake: Marine Andrew Tahmooressi says he mistakenly entered Mexico with guns in his car in March while trying to meet friends for dinner

Border: Tahmooressi says he accidentally entered the wrong lane at the border, and had no option other than to cross into Mexico and turn around

Jail: Tahmooressi has been jailed in Mexico since his March 31, arrest near Tijuana

Tahmooressi maintains that he never intended to leave the country but missed an exit when heading to meet friends in a border town.

'I was going to call them after I drove off the exit, but I never got 
off the exit, I blew right past it,' he told UTSanDiego.com in May during an 
interview from jail. 'I wasn't paying attention, thinking I had way 
farther to go. I ended up in Mexico with no way to turn around.'

Mexican authorities found three guns inside the truck he had recently 
driven from Florida to make a new start in San Diego. He was jailed, and has been held in a Mexican jail without bail ever since.

Wednesday's hearing will be Tahmooressi's first opportunity to tell his story to a judge. The delay has been caused by both Mexico's glacially paced judicial system and Tahmooressi's indecision in picking an attorney.

After firing two of his lawyers - one of whom reportedly instructed him to commit purjury - Tahmooressi has settled on Fernando Benitez, who tells Fox News that he plans to press the prosecution's witnesses until he gets honest answers.

Pressure: Senator Marco Rubio is one of several members of Congress to support Tahmooressi as critics fault the Obama administration for not doing more to get him released

'I hope they tell the truth, because if not, I'm gonna make them tell 
the truth and it's not gonna be pretty,' Benetiz told the network prior to the hearing.

Tahmooressi's case has garnered significant media attention, as critics have blamed the Obama Administration for not doing more to get him released over what he maintains was just an honest mistake.

In April, Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter wrote a letter asking Secretary of State John Kerry to secure Tahmooressi's release. State Department officials said they were aware of an arrest of a U.S. citizen in Mexico, but they do not comment on arrests of private individuals without the person's permission.

On Tuesday, Hunter and Nebraska Congressman Lee Terry sent a letter Mexican federal Judge Victor Octavio Luna Escobedo asking that he consider the fact that Tahmooressi's entry into Mexico was accidental.

'We believe the evidence supports Andrew's claim that he mistakenly 
entered into Mexico,' wrote the congressmen. 'One of the most compelling
 pieces of evidence is a 911 call Andrew made at the border checkpoint, 
where he stated he was unaware of his location.'

Prison: If convicted, Tahmooressi faces anywhere from six to 21 years in a Mexican prison

Similar cases have occurred before. In 2008, an active-duty Army soldier was jailed in Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, for driving into Mexico with guns, knives and ammunition.

In 1999, a Marine was detained in Tijuana for two weeks after driving into Mexico with guns.

If Tahmooressi is convicted, he faces six to 21 years in a Mexican prison, his lawyers said, adding that alternatively the case could be dropped if the Mexican attorney general's office in Mexico City requests dismissal.

Tahmooressi served four years in the Marines, including two tours in Afghanistan. He says he was honorably discharged in November 2012.

After he was jailed, Tahmooressi tried to escape by climbing over a gate and heading up onto a roof, and then onto another one. He gave up when a guard opened fire, but the incident earned him the nickname "Spider-Man."

Soldier: Tahmooressi served two tours in Afghanistan while a sergeant in the Marine Corps.

He later grabbed a light bulb and stabbed himself in the neck. He was taken to the hospital and given stiches.

He said he longs for his family and friends and has been receiving visits from an English-speaking Christian chaplain.

'I put my faith in God that he will take care of me,' he said. 'It was just a big mistake, and I hope that the people here will realize that and that the judge will realize that.'
