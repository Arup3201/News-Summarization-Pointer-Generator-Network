A lawyer for an Irish nanny charged in the death of a one-year-old Massachusetts girl has accused prosecutors of presenting 'false and deceptive' information to a grand jury.

Aisling Brady McCarthy, 34, of Quincy, is charged with murder and assault and battery on a child in the January death of Rehma Sabir, of Cambridge. She was hospitalized on her first birthday with severe head injuries and died two days later.

The defense attorney made the allegations against prosecutors today as she asked a judge to dismiss the charges.

The defense previously claimed prosecutors did not have enough evidence.

A prosecutor said the evidence was not misleading or false, and that authorities had to present a complete picture of the girl's injuries.

The judge did not immediately rule.

Last month, the nanny's lawyers also claimed Boston prosecutors acted unethically in the way they presented evidence to the grand jury that indicted her for the murder.

They were seeking the charges to be dismissed based on the alleged prosecutorial misconduct as well as a general lack of probable cause.

Plea: Irish nanny Aisling McCarthy Brady, 34, has pleaded not guilty to murdering an infant in her care last January

Her lawyers accuse Middlesex prosecutors of acting unethically in the way they presented evidence to the grand jury but there were no further details on how.

Questions have been raised about the length of time between when Brady was arrested, on January 21, and when indictments were obtained, some 80 days later.

The defense also contends the case is so weak that it does not meet the low legal threshold of probable cause.

Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement to The Boston Globe in August, her office is working on a response to the defense allegations, which they will soon file in court.

Brady was arraigned April 18 in Middlesex Superior Court, where she pleaded not guilty to all charges and was ordered held without bail.

The 34-year-old faces being deported 
to Ireland when the criminal case ends because she was living in Boston 
illegally, according to federal officials.

She
is accused of slamming little Rehma against a wall and changing table 
before pretending its lifeless body was sleeping to its relatives.

Defense
attorneys have claimed the baby was already 'sick' and 'not normal' 
while in her care before she was found bruised and unconscious in her 
family's Cambridge, Massachusetts home.

Rehma Sabir was 
hospitalized with severe head injuries on her first birthday, January 
14, before being declared brain dead two days later.

In April, prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said Brady violently shook 
Rehma, possibly bouncing the infant's skull off a changing table and a 
wall, as seen by plaster shattered from the wall.

Brady has been in the U.S. illegally for the past 13 years.

Nanny: The baby's parents, Nada Siddiqui and Sameer Sabir, told police McCarthy had been a nanny for their family for about six months

'The
wrong person has been charged with this crime,' her attorney Melinda 
Thompson said after her arraignment, according to the Boston Herald. 'This baby 
was not normal. This baby was sick'

Fitzgerald
said that the only 'sickness' Brady's defense was claiming was the 
baby experiencing separation anxiety after her mother recently started a
new job.

Fitzgerald said the infant's father, 
Sameer Sabir, and mother, Nada Siddiqui, were expecting family in from 
outside the country to celebrate their child's birthday when their child
never woke up.

Claims: McCarthy's defense claims that the infant was already sick and not normal before its death

When the baby's grandparents arrived 
at the home to see the child after Siddiqui had left for work, McCarthy 
told them Rehma was napping, according to Fitzgerald.

She presented them with a video baby monitor showing Rehma appearing to be sleeping as evidence.

Later when they returned that evening, around 4.30 p.m., McCarthy said Rehma was still sleeping.

The family went to wake the child, but were unsuccessful, prompting a call to 911.

According to Fitzgerald, damage was seen to the wall with chips of plaster found on the floor.

Blood was also found on the infant's pillow, a dish towel thrown in a trash can, and six baby wipes.

The blood was not publicly identified as belonging to Rehma.

Earlier in April, a Middlesex County grand jury also accused the nanny of assault and battery on a child causing bodily injury.

Brady had previously pleaded not guilty to assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury.

Prosecutors
said in the statement: 'The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner 
conducted an autopsy and ruled that the cause of death is blunt force 
head injuries, and the manner of death is homicide and not accidental.'

The
prosecutors also claim that investigators reached the conclusion that 
the nanny was alone with the baby when her fatal injuries occurred.

In February, a judge ruled in Brady's 
favor when her lawyer asked for the preservation of all records related 
to the baby's travel and people who were around her from June 2012 until
she died.

That included who traveled with the baby, where the baby stayed and whether medical personnel examined her.

The defense has claimed Rehma 
returned home malnourished after traveling overseas, including to 
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and London.

Authorities
also said a neighbor reported hearing the baby crying for nearly an 
hour on her birthday, followed by more intense crying, but knocks on the
family's door went unanswered.

The baby's parents, Nada Siddiqui and Sameer Sabir, told police Brady had been a nanny for their family for about six months.
