It’s been a torrid three years for most people since the world economy began to go into meltdown. But not everyone has suffered.

Investor Kyle Bass has already made millions from the credit crunch and he is set to increase 
his money by almost 650 times from a Greek default.

He founded hedge fund Hayman Capital in Dallas, Texas, in 2006 in his late 30s after saving $10million from selling bonds for Wall Street firms.

He made millions gambling against the 
sub-prime mortgage bond market - and now he’s betting on the collapse of
 whole countries in Europe.

Mr Bass’s story so far has been documented in Michael Lewis’s new book 'Boomerang: The Meltdown Tour' - serialised in The Sunday Times.

Mr Lewis charts how Mr Bass was one of only 15 people who placed ‘enormous bets that vast tracts of American finance would go up in flames’.

Mr Bass believed as the sub-prime market collapsed that the financial crisis was being hidden by rich western governments.

He
 said these nations had taken on ‘dodgy securities worth trillions’, as 
worldwide debts doubled over just a few years to $195trillion.

goal is not to be one of them'

A big issue he identified was large banks being treated as ‘extensions of their governments, sure to be bailed out in a crisis’.

Mr Bass spoke to Harvard economics 
expert Kenneth Rogoff about sovereign balance sheets and finally 
realised the scale of the problem when he presented him with some research.

Professor Rogoff told Mr Bass: 'I can hardly believe it is this bad' after he had looked at their figures.

Mr Bass replied: 'If you don’t know this, who does?’ and thought: 'Holy s**t, who is paying attention?'

‘The sub-prime mortgage crisis was more 
symptom than cause,’ Mr Lewis wrote. ‘Deeper social and economic 
problems that gave rise to it remained.’

'I thought: "Holy s**t, who is paying attention?"'

This made Mr Bass believe another bigger economic crisis was brewing - and he started to buy ‘credit default swaps’ on European countries, according to the book serialisation in The Sunday Times.

These let him bet against a bond’s price without owning it - like ‘default insurance on another person’s investments’.

He believes Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy and Spain are the countries least likely to be 
able to pay off their debts.

He bought Greek default insurance for 11 basis points - meaning insuring $1m of bonds would cost $1,100 dollars a year.

'We’ve bought a lot of this stuff'

A Greek default would make it pay down its debt by around 70 per cent, meaning every $1,100 bet would net him an astonishing $700,000, Mr Bass said.

He said his mother tells him to put his money in 'guns and gold'.

Mr Lewis recalled him pulling out a huge gold brick from his desk drawer and saying: 'We’ve bought a lot of this stuff.'

Mr Bass, who lives in a 40,000 sq ft house, has also bought 20 million nickels for $1million. He said the metal inside each coin is worth 6.8 cents.

‘It may not be the end of the world,’ Mr Bass added. ‘But a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money. Our goal is not to be one of them.'
