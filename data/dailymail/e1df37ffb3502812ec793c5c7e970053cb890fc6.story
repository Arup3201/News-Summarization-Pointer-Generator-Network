A man who accidentally killed three Australian children while speeding on a Danish road has told the parents he's not to blame and they should 'go on with their life'.

The O'Shea children - Saoirse, 9, Soren, 11, and Connor, 3 - were killed on impact when the car their mother was driving  was hit in Denmark.

Lasse Burholt, 40, was travelling at 125km/h in an 80km zone when he hit Maria O'Shea's car on July 16 last year.

The O'Shea children - Saoirse, 9, Connor, 3, and Soren, 11 - were killed on impact when the car their mother was driving was hit in Denmark last year

Ms O'Shea, who works in Pemberton, Western Australia, as a doctor with her husband Brian, was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter a day after the accident as she recovered in hospital with their surviving son, four-month-old Torben.

The O'Sheas started their own investigation to clear Maria's name and eventually had police prove that Burholt, a Danish father of three, had been speeding, Sunday Night reports.

Police initially claimed the mother of four had turned into the path of Burholt's oncoming car.

Mr O'Shea claims Burholt had been using his phone at time, which he says would explain why there were no brake marks on the road.

Burholt has denied using his mobile phone and that his actions were reckless, but he did admit to speeding.

'(Ms O'Shea) caused the accident,' he told the program. 'The fact is Maria made a turn that she wasn’t supposed to do.'

'You can’t tell if I hit her at 80 kilometres an hour you can’t say some kind of fatality wouldn’t have happened. If I had to spend all of my, all of my day thinking about what if what if and blah, blah, blah, then I don’t have time to think about all the other stuff.

'The O'Sheas need to go on with their life.'

The O'Sheas have since created a charity in honour of their children (Saoirse, Soren, and Connor) titled The Three Musketeers

Burholt was eventually found guilty in October of a low range dangerous driving charge and involuntary manslaughter.

He paid a fine of about $2,000 and maintained his license.

The O'Sheas have since created a charity and memorial Facebook page in honour of their children titled The Three Musketeers.

'I used to fear death. I don't any more, now the kids have gone before us. It's as if they're saying: "We've done it Dad, so you can do it too when the time comes for you",' Mr O'Shea told the Independent.

Nine-year-old Saoirse O'Shea was the only daughter of Maria and Brian, who lived in Pemberton in Western Australia

Maria O'Shea said her 11-year-old son Søren was a keen soccer player and would have been glued to the TV during the recent World Cup in Brazil

Connor O'Shea was just three-years-old when he died on impact on the Danish road

The O'Sheas said returning to their home in Australia after the crash was one of the biggest challenges they faced.

'I haven't been able to go into their bedrooms. I've looked into the boys' but haven't stepped into Saoirse's,' he said.

'Sometimes, when I'm on the computer working on their Facebook memorial page, I have to turn my eyes away from the photos. I can't bear to make a connection with them.'
