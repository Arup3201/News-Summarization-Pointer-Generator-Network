Some residents of one of Manhattan's wealthiest neighborhoods have voted to nix current plans for a handicap access path in order to preserve their views of the East River.

What's more, the new plan that Upper East Siders have approved will force some wheelchair-bound to traverse an additional block for access to the East River esplanade walkway, one that includes a dangerously busy parking garage.

The move preserves the panoramic river view  for residents of the apartment tower at 45 East River Avenue, where apartments can fetch up to $3 million, the New York Post reports.

Danger: The new proposal will force the wheelchair-bound to traverse an extra block that includes this dangerously busy parking garage

There currently exists just a crumbling set of stairs connecting a raised walkway and public park with the East River walkway down below.

In order to update those stairs and make them accessible for the handicapped, the city has proposed a new, fenced walkway that would stretch some 450 feet.

That most notably puts it directly in front of the posh 45 East End Avenue Co-Op, where one 30-year-old resident told the Post:

'I would look outside of my window and feel like a mouse in a laboratory...The view of the water would be ruined for a lot of people.' 

Improvements: Currently there is only this non-accessible bridge and set of decaying stairs

Regulations require that the walkway, which will extend above busy FDR Drive--a highway extending up the length of Manhattan's East Side--be lined by a fence to ensure nothing is thrown onto the roadway.

Resident of the local community board have suggested the chain-link be replaced with plexiglass.

However, city planners fear that, while preserving the view, a plastic barrier would be susceptible to vandalism and decay.

Groundbreaking is scheduled to take place on the ramp this spring, with a completion date projected for June 2016, according to A Walk in the Park. 

Pricey: Most affected by the view-obstructing bridge would have been residents of this building, where an apartment currently for sale has an asking price of $2.8 million

Along the East River in one of Manhattan's wealthiest neighborhoods, residents have voted to move the bridge a block north to 82nd Street

Between 81st and 82nd lies a dangerously busy parking garage that many wheelchair bound would have to brave to get the bridge access

The previous bridge would have placed a caged walkway between a building where apartments cost nearly $3M and the East River
