The 'biggest national security threat' to the U.S. at this juncture is not terrorists abroad, says former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, it's Congress.

'It's the total dysfunction in Washington. The fact that so little can be done by the Congress,' Panetta told CNN's Jim Acosta on Sunday during an appearance on State of the Union.

Earlier in the broadcast Panetta, the Pentagon chief from 2011 to 2013, said ISIS 'truly represents kind of a whole new face in the war on terrorism' because the extremist group is well-funded, well-armed and 'has a strong command and control.'

'And as a result of that, I think that they can conduct the kind of offensive operations that can be very effective,' he said, and therefore they must 'be met tooth and nail with everything we've got.'

The United States needs to bolster its strategy in confronting ISIS if it is going to achieve its mission of degrading and destroying the terror group, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said on Sunday

ISIS, Panetta told CNN's Jim Acosta, 'is a whole new chapter in terms of the terrorist threat to that area and to our country.' But the 'biggest' threat to U.S. national security is the dysfunction of Congress, he said

ISIS, he proclaimed, 'is a whole new chapter in terms of the terrorist threat to that area and to our country.'

Panetta said President Barack Obama has the 'right pieces in place to try to confront ISIS' and noted that the U.S. and its partners have 'made some important gains' in stopping the territorial expansion of militants in Iraq.

But even after prompting from fill-in host Acosta, Panetta would not say he agreed with Obama's claim last week that the United States' coalition 'is on the offensive' and ISIS 'is on the defensive.'

The president's 'strategy has to be bolstered in a strong way,' he asserted. 'We've got to be able to ensure that we are committed every day of the week towards making sure that this strategy works, that we disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat ISIS.'

Panetta acknowledged, as he did in his memoir, released in October of last year, that Obama and his administration bungled its response to the chaos in Syria and that the White House should have asked Congress for the authority to fight ISIS at least six months before it did.

The U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes on ISIS in Iraq since August, Syria since September, but it did not make a formal request to Congress for power to go to war with the terrorist group and its affiliates until last week.

The White House has been relying on a 9/11 era document for its authority to carry out military operations in the two countries. It last week asked Congress to tear up a 2001 Authorization of Military Force Agreement and replace it was an updated 'right-sized' resolution giving the president the ability to conduct an air and ground war against ISIS in any country it invades.

Despite its close work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to come up with a draft that satisfied both political parties, legislators are dissatisfied with the president's request for varying reasons. They have suggested they would not support the proposed AUMF in its current form.

The following day Ash Carter was confirmed by the Senate as Pentagon head, replacing Hagel

Panetta lashed out at Congress on Sunday for Members' unwillingness to put aside their differences to pass legislation addressing key problems.

They can't 'resolve the issue of homeland security. They can't deal with budgets. They can't deal with immigration reform. They can't deal with infrastructure. They can't deal with other issues,' he said, referencing a dispute over funding for Homeland Security that must end by Feb. 28 to avoid a partial shutdown of the department.

'If they wind up not being able to deal with this war authorization, that sends a terrible message to the world,' Panetta warned.

The former Defense head and CIA director stressed that ISIS 'is not an enemy that you can kind of stand aside and not confront.'

'If we stand aside, if we don't get involved, if we don't provide leadership, unfortunately, nobody else will,' he claimed. 

'That's why it's important for us to take a leadership position' in Iraq, Syria and 'elsewhere in confronting terrorism,' he said.

Panetta said he had 'tremendous confidence' in newly confirmed Secretary of Defense Ash Carter's skill set and ability to steer the president toward victory in the country's battle against ISIS.

'He's very bright,' Panetta said. Noting that Carter served as his No. 2 at the Pentagon, Panetta said the new military chief knows the Department of Defense inside out.

But 'in the end, it's the president who has to ultimately decide' whether to take the advice of his top military advisers, he said, or not.
