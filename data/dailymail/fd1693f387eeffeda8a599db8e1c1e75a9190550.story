Two RAF fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a passenger plane over fears it had been hijacked.

People on board the Scandinavian Airlines flight from Copenhagen to Birmingham watched Typhoons close in on their aircraft after air traffic controllers failed to make contact with the plane’s captain.

At a time of heightened anxiety following the Boston Bombings on April 15, fears were raised that the plane could be used in a terrorist attack as it entered British airspace over the North Sea.

Two Typhoons were scrambled from RAF Leuchars in Fife, Scotland, to intercept the plane carrying dozens of passengers before it closed in on populated areas, reported the Sunday Mirror.

A defence source told the Sunday Mirror that the RAF pilots flew ‘very, very close’ to the Scandinavian Airways plane so they could spot any suspected terrorist activity on board.

One Typhoon pilot was asked by RAF officials whether he thought he had been spotted by anyone on the plane, and he reportedly told them: ‘I think they have - they are taking photos of me.’

The flight’s crew eventually realised air traffic controllers were unable to contact them because their radio was tuned to the wrong frequency, reported Sunday Mirror.

The passenger plane was then escorted into Glasgow Prestwick Airport by the fighter pilots.

All departures from the airport in South Ayrshire were suspended while police arrived at the scene and questioned the plane’s crew about the incident, reported the Sunday Mirror.

But the flight was only grounded for an hour before it was allowed to continue onto Birmingham. The incident is believed to have cost the RAF almost £150,000.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed the Typhoon aircraft were launched on April 18 to intercept the aircraft. A Scandinavian Airlines spokesman said the company was investigating.
