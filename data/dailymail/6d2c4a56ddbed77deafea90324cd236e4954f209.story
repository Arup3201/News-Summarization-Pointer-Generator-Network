Boxing fans worldwide have picked an emerald green, diamond-encrusted belt to be strapped around the waist of either Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao at the conclusion of their $300million fight of the century in Las Vegas on May 2.

The WBC held a  public vote to choose between an onyx belt of unusual design or their more traditional green world champion belt, with the latter winning by a margin of just six per cent.

The cost of the belt is likely to be upwards of $1m.
