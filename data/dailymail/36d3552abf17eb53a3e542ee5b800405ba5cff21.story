These are the images that put you inside a reasonably-priced car taking part in the Top Gear celebrity challenge.

The popular feature has seen some of the biggest names in showbusiness try their hand at motor-racing - and made a star out of The Stig.

Top Gear fans can follow in the tyre tracks of The Stig after the BBC show's test track was added to Google Street View.

Green light: Revving your engine on the start line there is a clear stretch of straight tarmac to build up your speed as you get going

Out of the blocks: You should be hitting top speed by now, looking to get as quickly as possible to the first corner to make time

The Stig: The anonymous racing driver has been turned into a household name thanks to the Top Gear celebrity challenge

Willson: Usually the first turn seen on TV, and named after former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson. You must try not to let the bump on the way in unsettle the car and let it run wide on the way out

Foot down: After getting out of Willson you can get your speed up again as the road straightens out and hit top speed before you need to slow right down for Chicago.

The location at Dunsfold Aerodrome, 
Surrey, has been the venue for star guests such as Benedict Cumberbatch,
 Damian Lewis and Jamie Oliver to drive a lap for the programme.

Test
 driver The Stig - at the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Black - 
accompanied the Google car as it did a circuit of the 2.82km track.

Fans can find the track by typing Top Gear Test Track into Google Maps and drag the orange figure to the track.

Chicago: Designed by Lotus, and named after the Stig's favourite musical, this corner is hard on the brakes and the tyres

Count the revs: Another chance to hit top speed as you approach the notorious Hammerhead turn.

The commercial director for Top Gear 
at BBC Worldwide, Duncan Gray said: "From anywhere on the planet, Top 
Gear's millions of followers can now explore the official track from the
 show with some spectacular shots, thanks to Google Street View 
technology. We did have to tell The Stig to slow down a couple of times 
though."

Top Gear returns for a new series on February 2 on BBC2.

Hammerhead: Go in too fast and you will get terrible under-steer

Follow-through: You can really keep the foot down in this right-hand turn

Bentley: Named in honour of former Top Gear presenter and producer Jim Bentley, you have to be careful to mind the gap between the grass and the tyres as you hit the tight left-hand turn

Bacharach: You will need your brakes as you hit the tight left-hand turn named after another Stig favourite,  Burt Bacharach

Gambon: if you're brave you can let the car drift as you go round the last corner, named after Sir Michael Gambon who almost rolled his car here

The home straight: And you cross the finish line. How would you compare to a star in a reasonably priced car?
