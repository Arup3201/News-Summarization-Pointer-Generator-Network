An adulterous husband who underwent an exorcism to save his marriage attacked his wife when she accused him of still being possessed by Satan.

Anthony Berry 'snapped' after he was covered in holy water and threatened with a crucifix after he came home from a drinking session.

A court heard the 52-year-old sweet factory worker had for years endured his wife Claire’s belief that he was possessed after he admitted an affair and she joined an ultra-conservative Catholic sect.

But earlier this year Berry turned violent and grabbed his wife of 22 years by the neck.

Anthony Berry 'snapped' after he was covered in holy water and threatened with a crucifix by his wife after he came home from a drinking session

High Peak Magistrates in Buxton, Derbyshire heard that his wife screamed at him: ‘You’re not Tony' He replied: ‘No, I’m Satan, Prince of Darkness.'

Weeks later he lashed out again repeatedly punching her in the face in a 'brutal' assault that saw her flee their home.

Berry was convicted of two separate assaults following a trial last month, but he has been spared an immediate jail term after magistrates accepted he’d suffered 'a degree of provocation'.

The mother-of-two said the first attack took place at their home in New Mills, Derbyshire, on February 5 after Berry returned home from work just after 9.30pm.

After hours of arguing about him being with another woman he grabbed his 54-year-old wife by the throat and threw her across the room.

Prosecuting Jennifer Fitzgerald told High Peak Magistrates in Buxton, Derbys, Berry shouted: 'I’m going to kill you. I’m going to have your neck.'

The was said to have continued for four hours. Berry, who admitted having drunk up to eight pints, admitted grabbing her on three more occasions.

His wife then called for her sister who held rosary beads and threw holy water over Berry to subdue him while she thrust a crucifix in his face.

The court heard the second attack took place the following month after he returned home at 1am. He had been drinking and playing snooker with his brother. She too had been drinking.

Ms Fitzgerald said: 'An argument began. Mrs Berry holds some unusual beliefs. She believes he is possessed by demons and has a conviction that he may well be possessed by Satan himself.'

He went to bed, but she followed him upstairs to continue the row. He grabbed her by the neck and threw her onto the bed then held her down and repeatedly punched her on the side of her head.

He grabbed and twisted her ankle and when she managed to free herself Berry threw her onto the floor. She said she was 'too afraid' to stay in the house and slept in the garden under some carpets.

The next morning after he let her back into the house Mrs Berry telephoned her sister in Ireland who told her to call an ambulance which took her to hospital.

She suffered a swelling to the side of her face, bruising to her arms and legs, and damaged her back which caused her 'excruciating pain' for some time after and had to walk on crutches.

When questioned the battered wife told police she believed her husband’s violent behaviour was because he was Satan.

She said that in the past she had arranged for her husband to see an exorcist in France because 'he had signed a pact with the devil'.

At his trial Mrs Berry claimed her husband had been 'possessed' for more than two years. But under cross-examination she admitted his comments about Satan could have been 'ironical'.

Yesterday Ms Fitzgerald told the court Berry had received a caution for assaulting his wife in November 2010, but despite the latest violence she was still unsure if she wanted to save the marriage.

John Bunting, defending, told the court that to some degree Berry acted in self-defence after his wife had started the arguments. Not for the first time she brought up the affair her husband had back in 2011 and both had been drinking.

He spoke of the 'extraordinary provocation' his client, who up until recent events had no criminal record, had suffered over a number of years related to his wife’s 'unusual religious beliefs'.

Mr Bunting said the victim had acknowledged 'holding a crucifix in his face' and 'throwing holy water on him' during the first assault.

His wife claimed a blurred 'selfie' Berry had taken on a camera was photographic proof that he was possessed. She also claims he attracts evil spirits into the house and has seen a small dragon flying across the house when he’s there.

'Can you imagine living with someone who says you are possessed by Satan?' asked Mr Bunting. 'He even agreed to see an exorcist in France. This is not unusual behaviour, it’s extraordinary.'

But Chairman of the bench Bob Graham told Berry: 'Both of these assaults were prolonged and quite brutal and I have to say nasty. Drink was also involved and you also issued threats to kill.

'But we have taken into account there was a degree of provocation.'

Magistrates sentenced Berry to 16 weeks in jail, suspended for two years. They also ordered him to pay £620 costs and £80 victim surcharge.

Outside court Berry, who was raised in the Church of England, said he was 'sorry' for the violence and injuries inflicted on his wife, but said he had 'snapped'.

He said he had agreed to the exorcism last year in a bid to 'keep the peace' and save his marriage.

'But it has had it now,' he added. 'After all this it’s over.'
