He was stuck inside a scorching hot car engine for two hours after the driver set off for work.

But incredibly, this adorable kitten has survived - albeit, with severe burns to 25 per cent of his body.

The eight to ten-month-old feline, dubbed Mr Biscuits, is believed to have crawled into the engine in a bid to stay warm, as many strays tend to do at this time of year.

However, just hours later, the car's owner set off for work in East Falls, Philadelphia, and the kitten became trapped inside the increasingly hot machine.

Fighter: This kitten, dubbed Mr Biscuits, incredibly survived being stuck inside a hot car engine for two hours

Burned: The eight to ten-month-old feline is believed to have crawled into the engine in a bid to stay warm, as many strays tend to do at this time of year. He is suffered burns to 25 per cent of his body in the incident

During the rescue: The kitten became trapped in the car engine when the vehicle's owner set off for work 

The animal was only found when the motorist - who could not work out why the steering was not working properly - arrived at his office and looked under the car's hood, NBC reported.

After spotting his helpless passenger, the man contacted experts at The Grannie Project, a Chester County animal shelter, who took two hours to free Mr Biscuits from the dangerously hot engine.

The rescuers then rushed the kitten to Metropolitan Veterinary Associates, where an off-duty veterinarian experienced in treating burned animals turned up in her pajamas to help the animal.

The veterinarian found that Mr Biscuits had burns covering a quarter of his body, including a gaping hole in his back that suggested he may have caught fire during the drive.

'It was pretty significant - just the severe burn marks all over the back leg area and along his back, too.' Dr Steve Fernandez, of MVA, told myfoxphilly.com. 

The kitten is currently in a stable condition after undergoing surgery and a thorough cleansing of his wounds. However, he will need further care and additional operations in upcoming weeks.

Amanda Cox, founder of The Grannie Project,  said the feline was dubbed Mr Biscuits by rescuers after he started kneading - 'making biscuits with his paws' - during his treatment.

'It is amazing he survived this horrific journey.The engine was so hot it burnt right through his fur,' said Ms Cox, whose organization is paying for the kitten's care.

'Most cats that seek shelter in engines and are unfortunate enough to still be there when the car is turned on aren't as lucky as Mr Biscuits. Most of them are killed.' 

She added that, at this time of year, drivers should honk and knock on the hood of their cars before setting off to allow any hidden animals to escape.
