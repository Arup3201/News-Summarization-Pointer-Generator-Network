Wales Rugby League has unveiled a six-figure sponsorship that chairman Brian Juliff believes will help them realise their ambition of becoming one of the world's top four nations.

The record-breaking partnership, announced at a press conference on the eve of Wales' final European Championship fixture with Ireland in Wrexham, will see My Club Betting become the principal sponsor of the national team through to the 2017 World Cup.

Community and professional level clubs throughout the country will also benefit from the deal.

'We set out our vision two years ago to be a top-four nation rugby league nation, in terms of performance and governance,' said Juliff, a former professional with Wigan and Wakefield. 'We've no deadline on that because it's an ongoing process and we want to get there with Welsh players.

'I've not got anything against Australian players coming into the game to play for other nations, but in Wales the only way we'll build a supporter base is with Welsh boys playing for Wales.

'Of course, money is going to be key and I'm hoping the My Club Betting deal is going to add that income for us. It's a significant sum. The potential is huge because of the profits made in Wales we will get 20 per cent given back to the grassroots of the game. So it could run into millions of pounds.'
