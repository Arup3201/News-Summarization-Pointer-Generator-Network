A super-slim two-bedroom terraced house which is just 7ft wide has been put on the market for £235,000 – the same price as a four-bedroom detached home elsewhere in the country.

The skinny two-storey home, which is one of Britain's narrowest properties, boasts two bedrooms, a kitchen, reception room and a bathroom.

Situated in Haringey, north London, the property is due to be auctioned next month with a starting price of £235,000 which is the same cost of a property twice the size currently on offer in Burnley, Lancashire.

The slim London house was built in a driveway in 1996 by a keen entrepreneur who wanted to make some extra income. It has been owned by him ever since until it was put up for sale and snapped up by a property developer three months ago.

It has now once again been put on the market and will go up for auction in the capital on October 1.

The current owner said: 'My friends said I was mad to buy it. But I knew I had to. I'm confident there are quirky people who will want to buy it - as it's cheaper than many one-bedroom homes in this area.'

The narrowest house in London is believed to be a property on Goldhawk Road, Shepherds Bush, which stands just over 5ft wide.

Set over five levels - a lower ground, ground, first, second and third floor – it has just 1,000sq ft of space.

Another tiny property in the capital is a one-bedroom house in Denmark Hill, south-east London.

Put on the market for £450,000 earlier this year, the two-storey end of terrace house is just 8ft wide and has just 466 sq ft of space.

However, the narrowest property in the UK is a terraced home on the Isle of Cumbrae, off the Ayrshire coast in Scotland, which has a front facade measuring just 3ft wide.

However the building - known as The Wedge - does spread to 22ft wide as it moves back from the road, which has an average property value of £63,000.

One of Britain's smallest detached homes has been put up for rent near the town of Biggar in Scotland.

The Round House is a pint-sized dwelling described by estate agents as 'quaint and quirky'.

Set in the grounds of a private estate, the circular home has a small entrance hall, one bedroom, a living room/kitchen and shower room.

The unusual property in Symington, near Biggar in South Lanarkshire, has been put on the rental market for just £375 per calendar month.

This is around £450 per month less than the average monthly rent paid in the UK.

Shirley Kenyon, lettings co-ordinator at CKD Galbraith, in Galashiels, said: 'It has a tiny entrance hall and there is a living room, bedroom and en suite.

'I don't think we have had anything as small as this before.

'It a fun little place but it is only suitable for a single person. We have already had a lot of interest in it though.'
