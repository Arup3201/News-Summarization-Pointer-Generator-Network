NBC's boxing announcers have left the building.

The ‘disturbing’ behaviour by two NBC boxing commentators seated beside the ExCel centre ring during Friday’s fights prompted Olympic officials to ask the two men to move away, officials who oversee the matches have said.

Announcers Bob Papa and Teddy Atlas were offered a space with other media further back but chose to leave entirely, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) said.

'NBC commentators were offered a booth in the media tribune like other broadcasters because they were very disturbing for AIBA officials - even during bouts they were not broadcasting - being located at the edge of the Field of Play,' an AIBA spokesman said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

'They claimed that since no boxers from the USA were still in the running, they didn't want to stay anyway.'

NBC Sports spokesman Greg Hughes said there were two sides to every story and that the commentators left for other reasons that were not immediately disclosed.

'That is inaccurate and we will be calling the remaining bouts for the U.S. television audience, as planned,' an NBC spokesman said in an emailed statement, referring to AIBA quoting its commentary team as not wanting to stay anyway.

Offer: Officials with the International Boxing Association said they offered the commentators (Atlas, left; Papa, right) a place further away with the other broadcasters but they declined the offer and chose to leave

He said cameramen were continually recording the arena and from New York they would provide commentary.

Papa and Atlas have been critical of boxing judges and referees, saying that some decisions have been unfair and they don't like the way fights are judged.

Several defeated boxers have appealed decisions.

America's women boxers picked up two medals on Thursday, one a gold, but its men had their worst performance at an Olympic Games, failing to win a medal for the first time.
