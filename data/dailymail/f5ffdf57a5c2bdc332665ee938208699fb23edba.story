The grandmother of a five-year-old girl, who died after taking a mix of pills found at the home of one of her drug-addict mother's friends, has spoken of her heartbreak.

Ashton-Lynette Arnold had been raised by her grandmother, Stacy Molinelli, for the first two years of her life as her mother, Elizabeth Rydbom battle with drug addiction.

But, for the last three years of her all-too-short life, Ashton was in her mother's care while her devoted grandmother watched helplessly as the tragic steps to her death unfolded.

Tragic: Ashton-Lynette Arnold, who was known to child welfare agencies, died from a drug overdose

Ms Molinelli told the Miami Herald the Department of Children and Families said it would be futile for her to try to apply to be Ashton's legal guardian.

She had been caring for her grandchild after the girl's mother suddenly walked out on Ashton when she was just a few months old.

This meant the grandmother was left in a custody limbo, caring for the little girl whenever her mother decided to disappear.

'When
 Ashton was with me, she was taken care of. She was safe,' Ms Molinelli 
said. 'There were times I would see Elizabeth when she had the baby and 
she was so high she didn’t know the day of the week. And somehow DCF 
thought she was stable enough to care for a child.'

The department had investigated Ashton's welfare several times during her short life. Her mother had, according to a DCF report, a 'major problem' with meth and twice tested positive for narcotics.

Charges: Valerie Davenport, left, and Julianne Goldsmith, right, were also sent to prison over Ashton's death. The little girl had taken drugs found at the women's home, where police later found nearly 3,000 pills

Drug treatment was offered but the department never confirmed whether Rydbom took it.

'DCF has been in Ashton's life almost since she was born. They investigated, but they never followed up,' Ms Molinelli told the Miami Herald.

'Had they followed up, had they spent any time on this case, they would have seen that my daughter was a full-blown addict.'

Ms Molinelli described watching helplessly as her granddaughter was dragged from place to place in the last three years of her life.

Ultimately, it was while at the house of her mother's friends, that the little girl somehow took a fatal cocktail of pills.

Four people, including Rydnom and her partner Kimberly Alderman, were charged in connection with Ashton's death.

Cut short: Stacy Molinelli is heartbroken that her granddaughter never got the chance to see more of life

Her mother was accused of failing to raise the alarm as soon as she realized her child was seriously ill. The CPT reported a two-hour delay in seeking medical help for the child.

When police searched the house the girl had been staying at, they found nearly 3,000 pills.

Rydbom, Alderman, Valerie Davenport and Julianne Goldsmith, of Inglis near the Gulf Coast, were sentenced to two years in prison for child neglect. 

An autopsy showed Ashton had
diphenhydramine, morphine and amphetamine in her system. A team that investigates neglect cases also ruled that her death could have been prevented.

'The mother 
readily allowed her child to stay in her friend’s home several times a 
week, knowing the home was filthy and that pills were everywhere and 
readily accessible to the child,' the team said.

For Ms Molinelli, all she is left with are memories of the child she helped to raise, and a sense that more could have been done to save her.

'I
 think about all the things she is not going to be able to do. She is 
never going to have that first kiss. She is never going to graduate from
 high school,' she said.

'She is never going to dress up and go to the 
prom, have babies of her own, go to college and make something wonderful
 of herself.'
