Oscar voters ignored the Nelson Mandela biopic because 12 Years A Slave 'sucked up all the guilt about the black people', a British screenwriter has said. 

William Nicholson spent 15 years working on Nelson Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom which starred Idris Elba as the South African leader. 

However, he said he was devastated when the film didn't get the acclaim he was hoping for at the Academy Awards.

Speaking at the Hay Festival, Nicholson said: '12 Years A Slave came out in America and that sucked up all the guilt about slavery that was available. 

'They were so exhausted feeling guilty about slavery that I don't think there was much left over to be nice about our film. When it didn't become a winner it was devastating, actually, it was very distressing.'

Mandela died in December last year on the night that the film had its Royal premiere in London which was attended by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. 

Nicholson believes the leader's death also effected box office figures.

'We were deluged with Mandela stuff and after a week we all thought, please, take it away, we've heard enough about Mandela.' 

When the interviewer suggested that the Hay Festival should give out awards, Nicholson said 12 Years A Slave would always win. 

Nicholson wrote most of the speeches in the film because he said Mandela's speeches were often quite boring. He is also a novelist and writing books is his first love.

The writer is now working on a television series.

Idris Elba stars in Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom - a chronicle of Mandela's life journey from his childhood in a rural village through to his inauguration as the first democratically elected black president of South Africa. 

Mandela spent 27 years in an apartheid prison before becoming president and unifying his country with a message of reconciliation.

His efforts to heal his country after its long history of division made him one of the world's most loved leaders, viewed by millions as a secular saint.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge learnt of Mandela's death at the royal premiere.

Zindzi, Mandela's daughter was also present at the screening and when she heard the news, in a remarkable act of courage, she insisted the movie continue.

Speaking after the premiere, Elba said: 'Literally halfway through the film Mandela had passed and there was sort of a slight buzz around the auditorium.

'Interestingly, the Duchess, Kate, sort of turned to me and looked at me as she had her phone and I wondered what was wrong with her because she looked quite emotional, but the film's very emotional.

'And my girlfriend looked at me and handed the phone and I looked down and Mandela had passed and it was on a website.

'It was just the most surreal moment. I looked back at Kate and Prince William and they were just in tears with me. It was just odd. Very odd.

'There's a moment in the film and I play older Mandela and he says this one line and it is 'just open the gate and let me free' - and I kid you not, that that was that line when we heard the news that was on the screen.'

He and the film's producers decided he should make an announcement to guests who had gathered within the Odeon Leicester Square cinema in London.

Win: Director Steve McQueen, winner of Best Picture for 12 Years a Slave  poses with his Academy Award

Debut: Lupita Nyong'o, best supporting actress winner for her role in 12 Years a Slave picks up her award

'It only felt appropriate to say what had happened and honestly there was an audible gasp in the auditorium.

'Some people didn't know, they had their phones off. It was just surreal.

'It was very odd, after seeing the credits and I walk on stage. They were giving me a nice round of applause but it was just this moment where I had to say please sit down, and announcing the official speech from president Zuma of South Africa. It was just weird.'

Hollywood named the historical drama 12 Years a Slave starring Chiwetel Ejiofor best picture at the 86th annual Academy Awards.

Steve McQueen's slavery odyssey was based on Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir.

It was hailed as a landmark corrective to the movie industry's virtual blindness to slavery, instead creating whiter tales like 1940 best-picture winner 'Gone With the Wind.' 

12 Years a Slave is also the first best-picture winner directed by a black filmmaker.

Lupita Nyong'o won best supporting actress for her indelible impression as the tortured slave Patsey.

It was the feature film debut for the 31-year-old actress.
