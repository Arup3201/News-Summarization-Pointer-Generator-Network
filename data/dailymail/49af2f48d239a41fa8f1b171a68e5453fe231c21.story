Police officers have access to to the mainframe computers of three of four big mobile phone companies

At the headquarters of every police force in Britain is a small office called the 'Telecoms Intelligence Unit' (TIU). 

There, police officers can log in directly to the mainframe computers of three of four big mobile phone companies – Vodafone, Three and EE – as well as BT and internet service providers. 

EE comprises the former networks Orange and T-Mobile, whose police interface was called Plod – an acronym for Police Liaison On-screen Database.

Armed with the required usernames and passwords, in a few keystrokes the officers can retrieve confidential data from anyone's telephone or computer use within minutes.

Such swift access can save lives by finding an armed criminal on the run, or help track a terrorist before he strikes – but critics believe the ease with which police can access such information has led them to do so far more often than they should.

All it takes is a couple of senior officers within the force to sign off the request and any officer can have those details on his screen.

In theory, a safeguard system should stop spurious or illegal requests, but with more than 2,000 applications for data access under RIPA being processed each week across the UK, some wonder how effective that oversight can be.

When Parliament initially set up RIPA in 2000, it decreed that an investigating officer should first approach a 'SPOC' (or Single Point of Contact) colleague, who is independent of the investigation and trained to weigh up the request for 'necessity and proportionality'. 

If the SPOC considers it a valid request, he will take it to a designated senior officer, usually of superintendent rank or above, to be authorised.

The data is handed back through the SPOC by the TIU before being passed to the original officer.

Telecoms security expert Martin Hoskins, of Privacy Consulting, said: 'It's going on every hour of every day. As long as the police have the authorisation for the data, the door is always open for them.'

But he added: 'Quick access to communication data can be a matter of life or death if, for example, you're trying to trace a child carrying a mobile phone.'

Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to push through a new law stripping police of the power to secretly spy on journalists' phones
