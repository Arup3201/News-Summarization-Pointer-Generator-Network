A woman has been sentenced to five years’ probation after being found guilty of first sexually assaulting and then having intercourse with her best friend's teenage son over a two year period starting when he was just aged 13.

Karen Lee Carstens, 43, was convicted of sexual assault of a child by a jury in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday and was then sentenced on Thursday morning.

Police said she began sexual assaulting the teen in 2007 when he was 13 years old and eventually ended up having a sex with him on numerous occasion at her home.

‘I feel like she deserved everything that she got,’ the unnamed victim, now 19 years old, told KHOU.

The improper relations had begun when Carstens volunteered to help babysit the teen while her friend, the boy's mother, was hospitalized.

The boy described a couple of the encounters to investigators, particularly those which happened over a three-month period when his mother was in and out of the hospital due to a gallbladder infection.

He said on May 15, 2009, he and Carstens were lying on a sofa bed and watching television when they started to have sex.

The unnamed victim, now 19, told local TV news that he believed that Carstens had gotten what she deserved

According to court documents the boy 'cried believing he had impregnated [Carstens] but she assured him not to worry because her menstrual cycle was due soon.'

The boy told investigators that when the relationship began it involved just touching her breasts and genitals, but progressed to oral sex.

In the court documents, the boy described one encounter where he suggested anal sex as a way for them to avoid pregnancy. She at first refused but then allowed the teen to do it.

The affair ended shortly after when Carstens moved to Riva, Maryland.

Police say the victim said Carstens told him not to tell anyone about their sexual relationship because she could get into trouble.

Authorities investigated and found enough evidence to file charges against Carstens. Her bail was set at $30,000.
