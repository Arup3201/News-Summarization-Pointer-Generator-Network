Eric Abidal believes that Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain are a club with enough resources and ambition to lure Barcelona forward Lionel Messi away from the Nou Camp.

The former France defender, who played club football with Messi at the Catalan side  between 2007 and 2013, told Telefoot, 'As he has won everything at Barcelona, he would perhaps consider a new challenge in order to win new things

'It's possible. PSG has recently forged a group of players with determination and big objectives to reach. It may be a club that could please Messi.' 

Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has enjoyed huge success with the Catalan club

However, former France and Barcelona defender Eric Abidal feels Messi could do with a new challenge

Abidal suggested that Ligue 1 giants PSG could be a suitable destination for the 27-year-old 

Since making his debut for Barcelona in 2004, Messi has won 20 trophies with the club, including six league titles and the Champions League three times. 

Individually, he is also Barcelona's all time leading goalscorer and a four-time winner of FIFA's Ballon d'Or. 

In recent months, it has been speculated that Messi's relationship with Barca manager Luis Enrique has broken down, intensifying talk of a move. 

However, Abidal insists that if Messi were to leave Barcelona, it would be for purely footballing reasons and not because he is a disruptive figure in the dressing room. Rather, he has commended the forward's consistently dazzling performances that have helped to keep the club challenging for honours, even amid off-field politics and transfer controversy. 

'His influence on Barca is total. With his goals, he masks tensions, administrative or legal problems. He carries the team on his shoulders and allows it to live peacefully. He's part of a group of deciders,' Abidal said.  

Financed by foreign owners, PSG, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, are one of the growing powerhouses in Europe

During his time at Barcelona, Messi has won FIFA's prestigious Ballon d'Or award four times 

Messi has won 20 trophies with Barca, including three Champions League titles, the last coming in 2011

Abidal has dismissed reports of a fallout between Messi and Barcelona manager Luis Enrique

Messi has been in superb form for Barcelona so far this season, scoring 37 goals in 34 games

'I've never seen Leo ask for anything. Even regarding the team selection.' 

Of course, any club that does move for Messi will likely have to pay a world record transfer fee. 

The current record stands at £86million, set by Real Madrid's signing of Welsh winger Gareth Bale from Tottenham in 2013.  

Real Madrid broke the world record transfer fee in 2013, when they shelled out £86m to sign Gareth Bale
