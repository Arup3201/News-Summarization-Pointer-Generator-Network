We don't need analysts to tell us what we already know. The evidence is there on High Streets across the country for all to see: well-dressed, middle-class women armed with those familiar brown paper bags bulging with cut-price clothing.

And not a hint of shame in sight. Primark has become such a middle-class staple that it has even opened concessions in swanky Selfridges department stores.

A generation ago, these women were customers Marks & Spencer could confidently call its own. This month, however, poor old Marks announced its ninth successive fall in clothing sales - a trend that has been going on for two years, despite its slick £5 million advertising campaign by renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz, featuring 'leading ladies' Dame Helen Mirren, Darcey Bussell and Tracey Emin.

Primark, meanwhile - playing on low prices rather than swanky advertising - announced a record 44 per cent rise in profits in the same period.

So is this where the M&S shoppers have gone? And can Primark's budget clothing really match M&S's quality? ANNA PURSGLOVE took to the shops to see exactly how their winter wardrobes measure up.

PRIMARK: Embellished jumper,  £16, jeans, £7,  shoes, £12, Total: £35

M&S: Embellished jumper, £49.50, jeans, £35,  shoes, £29.50,  Total cost: £114

PRIMARK

Embellished jumper, £16, jeans, £7, shoes, £12, Total: £35

Fabric: The acrylic fabric of the jumper is too fluffy for the embellishments and I kept getting them caught on the sleeves.  Unless you keep your arms pinned to your sides, you'll have snags galore in no time.

Fit: The jumper is too bulky to be sexy but too rhinestoned to be practical for daily wear. And don't mention the shoes - agony. I think Primark may have forgotten that women have toes.

M&S

Embellished jumper, £49.50, jeans, £35, shoes, £29.50, Total cost: £114

Fabric: I love this sweater. The embellishments are beautifully detailed without being in your face and the fabric feels as soft as cashmere (although, in fact, it’s mostly man-made fibres with 8 per cent angora).

Fit: Beautiful - the plunging v-neckline sits in just the right place for a subtly, sexy look. You could easily dress this up a bit with a pencil skirt. And the shoes are far more comfortable than Primark's.

Verdict: Save money by buying your skinny jeans in Primark and get the rest from M&S. Do bear in mind that Primark sizes are significantly smaller - I was easily a 10 in Marks but a 12 in Primark.

PRIMARK: Coat, £25,  jeans, £7, shoes, £12 Total: £44

M&S: Coat, £139, jeans, £35, shoes, £25 Total: £199

PRIMARK

Coat, £25,  jeans, £7, shoes, £12 Total: £44

Fabric: The jeans are lovely and soft, as is the coat - despite being 100 per cent synthetic. I'm not a fan of the ultra-shiny buttons (cheap fastenings so often give budget clothing away), so I'd change these for something less obvious.

Fit: The short coat has a nice Sixties vibe, although Primark hasn't quite got the funnel neck right.It catches you just under the chin, which gets annoying quickly. Again the shoes are painfully unwearable - even though I only had them on for a short time.

M&S

Coat, £139, jeans, £35, shoes, £25 Total: £199

Fabric: Excellent on all counts. The coat - a polyester and wool blend - feels warm without being too bulky. The jeans are beautifully soft, yet nice and fitted, suggesting they won't bag dreadfully around the knees or bottom.

Fit: I'm only 5 ft 3 in so often get swamped by coats, with the result that I was particularly pleased with this one. And thank you to M&S for some very comfy leopard-print heels. These I could dance in.

Verdict: Again, save some money by buying your skinny jeans at Primark, then spend the difference on the M&S coat. This red number was one of my favourite finds and feels far more expensive than its £139 price tag.

PRIMARK: Blouse, £9, skirt, £14, shoes, £12 Total: £35

M&S: Blouse, £49.50, skirt, £149, shoes, £29.50 Total: £228

PRIMARK

Blouse, £9, skirt, £14, shoes, £12 Total: £35

Fabric: The skirt is nicely lined (I do hate the feel of a scratchy sequin against your skin) and surprisingly heavy given the price. But the shirt isn't particularly breathable, so I wouldn't advise any heavy lifting or vigorous dancing while you're wearing it. It could all get a bit sweaty.

Fit: Full marks for the cut of the shirt and skirt, which is an excellent budget buy. Not so many points for the metallic high heels.

M&S

Blouse, £49.50, skirt, £149, shoes, £29.50 Total: £228

Fabric: Believe it or not this skirt is 100 per cent leather, which is why it feels so lovely and breathable. The shirt fabric, although man-made, still feels airy and light.

Fit: The shirt is great (if a little too piratey around the sleeves for a short-armed woman like me). But the cut of the skirt is disappointing. Neither an  A-line silhouette nor a pencil, it's an indeterminate shape for such a bold fabric. The designers should be more courageous. The shoes pinch a little - not for dancing.

Verdict: I'd go with the M&S shirt (I particularly like the embellishment around the neckline), but save yourself some money and go to Primark for the rest of the look.

PRIMARK: Cardigan with chain detail, £14, dress, £12, shoes, £12, Total: £38

M&S: Boucle jacket, £59, dress, £69, shoes, £25 Total: £153

PRIMARK

Cardigan with chain detail, £14, dress, £12, shoes, £12, Total: £38

Fabric: The dress looks OK from a distance, but the lace layer was already beginning to tease itself out into very unattractive strings when I picked this up in the shop - not a good sign.

Fit: The lining of the dress was too long for the lacey overlay. All wrong. And, yet again, it's best not to mention the shoes. I like the cardigan, however. It's cut nicely and is a good compromise if you can't afford to splash at M&S.

M&S

Boucle jacket, £59, dress, £69, shoes, £25 Total: £153

Fabric: This lace dress is lovely and soft, and boucle jackets are a particular favourite of mine.You would expect to pay well over £200 for a jacket like this from a designer label, so this really is an absolute bargain.

Fit: The frock is so flattering - it really sucks you in at all the right places. The shoes with the bow detail were almost as comfortable as the leopard-print heels.

Verdict: The Primark dress looks and feels cheap and is cut very badly. I'd go for the Marks one every time. As good as the Primark cardigan is, I must say that the winning item in this section is that classy M&S jacket.

PRIMARK: Dress, £10, shoes, £12 Total: £22

M&S: Dress, £99, shoes, £29.50 Total: £128.50

PRIMARK

Dress, £10, shoes, £12 Total: £22

Fabric: I was definitely braced for scratchy lace considering that this skater-style dress cost only £10. But again, a pleasant surprise from Primark - how on earth do they manage it?

Fit: A shorter, flirtier  style, but every bit as good a fit as the M&S dress - for nearly a tenth of  the price. Just a shame once more about the excruciating shoes. So tight! When it comes to these outfits, Primark just can't match  the quality of Marks' wearable shoes.

M&S

Dress, £99, shoes, £29.50 Total: £128.50

Fabric: Not a hint of scratch to the lace here either, so well done M&S. The red shoes are reasonably comfortable but not quite as suitable for a night on the dancefloor as the leopard-print pair.

Fit: The lining of this  dress was a little too  flimsy for my liking, and really wasn't as supportive as the chic black  lace number. You want to feel really sucked in by a va-va-voom style like this and I didn’t. But the full-length sleeves are very flattering, especially for older arms.

Verdict: Sorry Marks, but I can’t see a reason to splash out nearly £100 on a red lace dress when you only need to spend a tenner. Primark wins this one hands down. Or should that be hem up?
