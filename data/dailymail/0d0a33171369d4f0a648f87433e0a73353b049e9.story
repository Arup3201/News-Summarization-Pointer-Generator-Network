As co-host of The Voice UK Emma Willis has been causing a stir recently with her sexy and sophisticated fashion choices.

Twitter went crazy for the Victoria Beckham design the presenter chose for this week's live quarter finals, as she showed off her fabulous figure in a pastel pencil dress.

And now the weekend TV star, 39, has ramped up the sex factor once again, posing in tiny shorts and a camisole as she is announced as celebrity ambassador for shaving brand Venus.

The Gillette brand chose the 39-year-old to front their 'Use Your And' campaign because they say she is a 'great example of a modern woman who has unleashed her potential'.

And as a TV presenter, radio host, model, mother and wife (the TV favourite has two children Isabelle and Ace with husband Matt Willis of McBusted fame) Emma certainly knows how to fit a lot into life.

Recently Emma stood down from her long-term presenting role on Celebrity Big Brother show Bit On The Side.

The Channel 5 show, which the mother-of-two co-hosted with Rylan Clarke, was thought to be her career highlight until she hit the ratings big time on BBC1 show The Voice. 

The 'Use Your And' campaign wants to inspire women and girls to use the word AND instead of OR in order to celebrate the many different qualities that make us all unique.

Emma said: 'I‘ve always believed that having many different interests, ambitions and ideas is what makes life interesting.

'Women today have the chance to try so many different things, develop their skills and of course define who they want to be more than ever.

'So I’m really surprised that according to a recent study into stereotyping and labelling by Venus, a whopping 70 per cent of British women still feel held back by one-dimensional labels placed on them

'I’m proud to partner with the brand on the new Use Your And campaign, which aims to inspire and encourage women everywhere to celebrate all the different brilliant qualities that make them unique'. 

Sharing her budget beauty tips with FEMAIL, Emma said: 'As a woman who is constantly on the move there is nothing more I love than a bargain beauty buy which I can pop in my handbag. I have always loved Paw Paw Ointment – it’s just one of those multi-tasking products you keep in your beauty bag which I can use on my lips, skin, even my eyelids for a little sheen. 

'I also love the new Venus Snap portable razor, so cute I can just pop in the handbag so whether I’m dashing to work or to the gym; I know I can always have instant smoothness on-the-go and a feeling of confidence.' 

While she has made brunette pixie crop her signature, Emma revealed she may be tempted to follow in newly blonde Kim's foosteps soon. She said: 'I adore Michelle Williams’ style, she is the reason I cut my hair short in the first place! I would also love to try being platinum blonde like her, a real change from my existing shade.' 

Emma's new campaign has the hashtag #UseYourAnd and Venus has made a video to launch it at www.youtube.com/gillettevenus.
