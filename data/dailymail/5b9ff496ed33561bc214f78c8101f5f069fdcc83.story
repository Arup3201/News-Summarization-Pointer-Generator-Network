Two o'clock in the morning and I'm sitting on the side of the bed, drenched in sweat. It's minus five outside, yet the skylight window is wide open and a fan is whirring by my side.

The damp bed is so uncomfortable that I have to change the sheets and pillowcases before I can go back to sleep - even though I need to be up in four hours' time.

When it's at its worst - at least once a month - I sleep in the spare bedroom. Peter, my other half, has been incredibly supportive, even though he's been as sleep-deprived as me over the years.

I'd love to pause the 'change' - my menopause is a 'waking nightmare', says Barbara Metcalfe

This waking nightmare is my menopause - my so-called 'change'.

It's four years since it started, I have no idea when it will end and it's causing my life to disintegrate around me. I hate and resent it, and cannot understand why any woman would relish it. But apparently some do.

Indeed, in last week's Femail, Jenni Murray, the esteemed broadcaster and journalist, offered the somewhat controversial view that the menopause 'ushers in the best years of a woman's life'.

She was writing in response to research which claims women will eventually evolve out of the menopause, as we continue to have children later and later.

I'm afraid I cannot meet it with 'courage and adventure' as Jenni suggests. Any sense of adventure I might have had has been long lost in the myriad of ailments and conditions I am grappling with.

Since the onset of  menopause I have not been able to wear shoes indoors, as my feet are so hot. Even on the coldest day I sit in meetings, colleagues in fur-lined boots staring bemused at my bare toes.

I wear thin linen clothing throughout the year and even then I find being in most buildings impossible.

A trip to the local supermarket is like an invitation to a sauna. You'll always find me in chilled foods.

There really is nothing like a hot flush. If you've never had one, you may think it's just like going red with embarrassment. But it's so much worse. It starts from within - like molten lava - and slowly takes you over.

Controversial: Jenni Murray believes that menopause 'ushers in the best years of a woman's life'

It stops me mid-task and I am overwhelmed by the heat. It makes my ears ring and I feel sick and forget what I am doing or what I am saying.

Sometimes the side-effects are so debilitating and distressing that it's tempting not to leave home.When I did make it to work - until last year I was a producer at the BBC - I would find myself erupting into huge rages over the office heating.

'If it's 25 degrees you should be on a beach in a bikini,' I would shout, and ram the thermostat down to 16c. I once actually snarled: 'I am the producer, I will decide what temperature to have.'

To get out of bed in the morning is a relief from the night sweats, but then begins a day marred by terrible tiredness, hot flushes and confusion. I constantly write lists so I don't forget things. On bad days I feel as if I'm losing my mind, just clinging on to reality. So much for a sense of adventure!

My menopause started when I was 50 and had a total hysterectomy.

Abnormal cells were found in my womb, which if left could have led to cancer, so I had  my womb and ovaries removed. With my ovaries went my supply of the female hormone oestrogen. Instead of having the slow dwindle of fertility that nature intends, I had what's called a surgical menopause, when everything happens at once.

I was still hooked up to a drip the day after surgery when the first sweats arrived.

There was very little discussion in hospital about what I was to expect, as if the surgery and the after-effects were completely unrelated. I left hospital with nothing more than the internet to guide me.

I found myself reading about all kinds of cures, from the conventional (hormone replacement therapy) to herbal remedies (black cohosh and red clover) and the utterly bizarre medication which is oestrogen extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.

I went down the conventional route, and, full of hope, began a course of HRT.

Within days, my breasts felt painful and engorged. I became depressed and confused and -worse - the sweats and flushes didn't even abate.

'Oh, did I mention the mood swings? I 
didn't just snarl about the air conditioning, one minute I was ranting 
at the poor dog for getting under my feet, the next I was in floods of 
tears when I'd accidentally broken a glass in the kitchen.'

I gave it some time for the tablets to kick in - during which my already huge bosom went up a full cupsize - but I only became more bloated, itchy and frankly miserable. So, about six months later I came off it. I tried red clover and other natural remedies but quickly realised nothing was going to work. So I took nothing.

I sometimes think I genuinely do have dementia, such is my lack of recall at times. My children laugh at me kindly, because I use the wrong words and forget key names and dates. I once told them an elderly neighbour had to be taken to prison, which had them flabbergasted. Eventually they discovered I meant hospital.

After my operation, my once impressive memory was shot to pieces. Suddenly I couldn't remember the names of colleagues I'd worked with for years. One reporter was called Hilary so often she started answering to it – even though she's really called Naomi.

I finally left my job at the BBC, which was in part down to the menopause. The building was incredibly hot and I found I was so exhausted when I got home.

Oh, did I mention the mood swings? I didn't just snarl about the air conditioning, one minute I was ranting at the poor dog for getting under my feet, the next I was in floods of tears when I'd accidentally broken a glass in the kitchen.

And if my mind was breaking down, my body felt like an alien being, too. The lack of oestrogen has left the skin on my arms and legs dehydrated and itchy, which drives me to despair. Sometimes I scratch until I bleed, even though there is no rash to be seen.

My hair is turning into a Brillo pad - I resemble Hagrid, the Robbie Coltrane character in Harry Potter.I feel as if I have taken the express route to old age.

The menopause is still thought of as something women just have to get on with, and this means, on top of all my symptoms, I feel like a failure because I struggle to cope.

When my grandmother was going through The Change, there was no discussion about it at all. Likewise my mum, a district nurse, had to get on her bike and visit her patients as if she hadn't a care in the world.

It's getting hot in here: For those with the menopause, hot flushes can be deeply debilitating

It was a personal battle women kept to themselves. My friend's mum would vacuum in her bra and skirt because of her hot flushes. Yet nothing was ever said, and no one ever questioned her.

That was 30 years ago and it appears nothing much has changed.

Like generations of women before me, I have to get on with it. I have two young daughters, a partner and a dog, and an exciting job as a freelance TV producer, writer and lecturer. The alarm goes off daily at 6am and there is no going back to bed.

Yet some of the effects of the menopause are illnesses in themselves. Just imagine a man or young woman waking repeatedly in the night, clothes soaked through and having to change the bed.

Would they just get up in the morning and go to work? More than likely they would ring in sick and get a sympathetic hearing.

But I wonder how many older women would do that. Ring in and talk menopause with their bosses? No thanks.

Recently, a friend had to take some time off work to recover from the fallout of her menopause. On her return, she was interviewed by two young male managers about her leave.

She tried to explain her  problems, but they stopped her mid-flow. Either they couldn't cope with 'women's problems' or they just didn't want to know.

Luckily for me, my doctor told me about clinical trials of specific anti-depressants, which had shown promising results controlling night sweats and flushes in menopausal women. So far they are helping me, but they're all I have.

Because there is just no cure for this force of nature. If there was, I am sure I would be first in a very long line of women wanting it.
