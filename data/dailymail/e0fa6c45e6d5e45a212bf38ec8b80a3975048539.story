Movie and TV streaming site Wuaki has launched in the UK looking to rival the likes of Netflix, Lovefilm and Blinkbox.

It claims to be the first site to offer monthly subscriptions with unlimited streaming as well as the ability to buy new film and TV releases in one place.

Subscriptions cost £2.99 a month and Wuaki - dubbed Spanish Netflix - has also partnered with major Hollywood and TV studios to offer newer releases for sale.

Movie and TV streaming site Wuaki has launched in the UK. It claims to be the first site to offer subscriptions, streaming and the ability to buy new film and TV releases in one place. The site has launched at £2.99 a month - cheaper than Netflix and Lovefilm

Spanish-based Wuaki.tv was founded in 
Barcelona in 2009 before being bought by Rakuten, the Japanese company 
that owns Play.com. 

It claims to be the first site in the 
UK to offer subscriptions, called Wuaki Plus, film and TV rentals as 
well as sell digital copies of new releases on the same site.

Netflix only offers streaming 
subscriptions, while Lovefilm offers streaming and postal DVD rentals, 
and sites such as the Tesco-owned Blinkbox cover just rentals and sales.

It takes around a year for new 
releases to be made available for streaming but sites that sell films 
and TV shows get given them by the studios much sooner. 

This means Wuaki has older, classic content on its Plus program but can also offer newer releases such as Disney's Oz The 
Great and Powerful and Lincoln through its paid-for and rental section.

Monthly subscription: Wuaki Plus costs £2.99 at launch (usually £5.99)

New movies: Start at £3.49 to 
rent and £10.99 to buy.

Older titles: Start at £2.49 to rent and £7.99 to buy.

Because the site has launched in beta, Wuaki.tv has a 
limited catalogue  - although the 
company has not released official figures.

This includes content from Warner Bros, Disney, Sony Pictures 
Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment as well as 
the BBC. 

'Streaming services have grown significantly in the UK, and we see a 
huge gap to offer a hybrid of the traditional subscription and a la 
carte models,' said Jacinto Roca, founder and CEO of Wuaki.tv.

'Our 
Wuaki Plus subscription offers a quality service at an attractive 
monthly rate.

'However, we know many people also want to rent or buy the 
very latest new releases, which are usually not available on 
subscription streaming services immediately, and others simply prefer to
have on-demand on an a la carte basis.

'With Wuaki users can have both, 
and pick-and-choose what they want, when they want.'

Individual new releases including Lincoln, starring Daniel Day Lewis, pictured, start at £3.49 to rent and £10.99 to buy. Older titles including Hitchcock's North by Northwest cost £2.49 to rent and £7.99 to buy

The Wuaki Plus subscription usually costs £5.99 - the same as Netflix
- yet is available at launch for £2.99 for a limited time.

Wuaki has not announced when this offer runs out but did add that 
anyone who signs up under the £2.99 deal will pay that price for the 
length of their subscription.

Rakuten's Play.com customers additionally get a 50 per cent off voucher for the first two films they buy.

Individual new releases including Hitchcock, starring Anthony Hopkins
and Helen Mirren, and Seth Rogen's The Guilt Trip start at £3.49 to 
rent and £10.99 to buy.

These prices are the same as Blinkbox.

Older titles, such as North by Northwest costs £2.49 to rent and £7.99 to buy.

This is more expensive than Blinkbox, which offers older films such as Season of the Witch starring Nicolas Cage and Space Dogs for just 99p to rent and £6.99 to buy.

TV series on Wuaki start at £5.99 for older shows such as The Office, and £9.99 for more recent shows including BBC's Luther, pictured. The beta site is only available online on PCs and laptops but will launch on more devices in the summer

TV series on Wuaki cost around £5.99 for older shows such as The Office, and £9.99 for more recent shows including BBC's Luther.

However, the beta site is only available online on PCs and laptops.

This means that if a customer buys a film, they can only watch it when they have a web connection and the films can't be watched offline.

It also means that films can't be streamed on phones, tablets or other web-connected mobile devices.

Wuaki said the service will remain in beta while more titles are added.

The company also plan to add support for smartTVs, tablets, and games consoles over the summer.
