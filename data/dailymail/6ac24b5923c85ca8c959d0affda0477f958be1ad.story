Chelsea travel to PSG in the Champions League last-16 first leg at Parc de Princes on Tuesday night knowing that the biggest threat to their progress is talismanic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

The Sweden international is no stranger to the extraordinary and his career - spanning 16 years and seven clubs, including spells at AC MIlan, Barcelona and Juventus - is littered with ridiculous and sublime goals.

Here, Sportsmail reminds you of ten of Ibrahimovic's best strikes.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic jumps for joy after scoring arguably his best goal against England at Wembley

The Sweden international has enjoyed huge success at a number of top clubs, including Inter Milan

AJAX vs NAC Breda, 2004-05

Ibrahimovic made a name for himself as a scorer of great goals during his three-year spell with Dutch giants Ajax, and they don't get much better than this.

The striker showed his power and skill in equal measure as he danced through the NAC backline embarrassing several defenders and the goalkeeper on his way to slotting home.

Roma vs JUVENTUS, 2005-06

Ibrahimovic's exploits at Ajax soon led to Europe's elite casting their eye on the unpredictable striker, who made a big-money move to Italian heavyweights Juventus.

In his first season at the club Ibrahimovic scored 16 league goals including this beauty against Roma. The striker produced a brilliant improvised flick before bullying the defender with brute strength and firing past the keeper with the outside of his boot. 

Benfica vs JUVENTUS, 2005-06

During the same season Ibrahimovic scored this absolute worldy against Benfica in the Champions League when he latched on to nothing more than a hopeful punt up field.

The forward out-muscles his opponent before spinning in behind and unleashing a ferocious volley from 25 yards with his, supposedly, weaker left foot that ends with both the ball and the keeper in the back of the net.

INTER vs Bologna, 2008-09 

After two successful seasons at Juventus the club were relegated to Serie B following the uncovering of the Calciopoli scandal and while several big-name players remained at the, the Italian second tier wasn't for Zlatan.

He moved to Inter and continued where he left off adding this wonderful near-post back heel volley to his burgeoning collection of stunning goals. 

INTER vs Atalanta, 2008-09

Ibrahimovic again turned to the unorthodox method of using the back of his foot as he scored the winner in a seven-goal thriller against Atalanta.

The chance appeared to be gone but as Ibrahimovic stumbled under the challenge of a defender, with his back to goal, he swung his heel back and stunned the goalkeeper, who remained rooted to the spot.

INTER vs Fiorentina, 2008-09 

Ibrahimovic has scored a number of brilliant free kicks during his career, but this one makes the selection for its sheer power and accuracy.

The striker placed the ball a full 40 yards from goal and struck it with such power that it was past the keeper in a heartbeat. The bend on the ball and the fact it cannoned in off the crossbar only add to the spectacle.

Lecce vs AC MILAN 2010-11 

Not too dissimilar to his earlier goal against Benfica for Juventus, the then AC Milan striker created a stunning goal out of absolutely nothing.

Ibrahimovic raced on to a clearance, bursting past one defender with great pace, before barging another out the way and finally sending a controlled lobbed volley over the goalkeeper, who was no more than three yards off his line.

SWEDEN vs France, 2012

During the 2012 European Championships Ibrahimovic scored another technically brilliant goal as Sweden beat France 2-0, and even helped England top Group D.

A hopeful cross from the Sweden right arrived to Ibrahimovic just inside the penalty area and the striker acrobatically connected with a flying volley that flew past Hugo Lloris.

England vs SWEDEN, 2012-13

Arguably Ibrahimovic's best goal came against England at Wembley. It may have only been a friendly but the Sweden international won the 2013 FIFA Puskas Award with this over-head kick from the best part of 35 yards.

Granted, he had a little help from Joe Hart, who rushed out of his area only to head the ball about 10 yards clear, but take nothing away from the finish as Ibrahimovic instinctively reacted by acrobatically sending it back towards the goal with a flying propeller kick.

Marseilles vs PSG, 2012-13

Finally, it's another one from Ibrahimovic's collection of unorthodox volleys, this time for current club PSG during a Ligue 1 clash against Marseilles.

A corner is swung into the box and Ibrahimovic holds off the defender and shows remarkable control to flick the ball past the keeper with an incredible amount of power and accuracy.
