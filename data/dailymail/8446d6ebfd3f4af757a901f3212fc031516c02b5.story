Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez has been using an anti-gravity treadmill in a bid to speed up his recovery from the foot injury that has kept him sidelined since the start of last month.

The Colombia ace broke the fifth metatarsal in his right foot during the Champions League winners' 2-1 La Liga win against Sevilla at the Bernabeu on February 4.

The 23-year-old was expected to be out for around eight weeks but appears on course to make an early return after already taking part in light training sessions with the squad.

An anti-gravity treadmill is used in rehabilitation to take pressure off the injured part of the body to allow players to train without the risk of aggravating the injury.

Now James has taken to Instagram to document the latest phase of his recovery as the £63million man shared a video of him running on an anti-gravity treadmill.

James' return will be welcomed by coach Carlo Ancelotti as Real Madrid continue to struggle in La Liga.

The Champions League winners have failed to win in their last three games having drawn with Villarreal before being beaten by Athletic Bilbao as Barcelona usurped Real at the top of the league.

Los Blancos hit a new low on Tuesday as they were beaten 4-3 at the Bernabeu by Schalke, only just scraping through to the Champions League quarter-finals thanks to their 2-0 win away in the first leg.

James returned to light training with Real Madrid last week and is expected to make a return soon
