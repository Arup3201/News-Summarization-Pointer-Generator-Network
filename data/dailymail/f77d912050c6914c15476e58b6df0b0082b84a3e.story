Lionel Messi and Barcelona turned on the style to dump Manchester City and their inspired goalkeeper Joe Hart out of the Champions League.

It was thanks to Hart's heroics that Barcelona could manage only a 1-0 win at the Nou Camp.

Ivan Rakitic scored the only goal of another one-sided encounter between the two sides, completing a 3-1 aggregate win to secure the Catalan giants' place in the quarter-finals.

Barcelona (4-3-3)

Ter Stegen 8

Excellent handling and produced an important save from Aguero’s penalty.

Alba 7.5

Looked solid at left back. Did his best to wind up Nasri — and it worked well.

Alves 7

The epitome of a winger playing full back — defending is the last thing on his mind.

Pique 7.5

Looked very classy at the centre of defence. Excellent passing and positioning.

Mathieu 7.5

Like Pique, he snuffed out City’s attacks by getting into position early.

Suarez 8

It takes a certain type of player to be comfortable working with Messi and Neymar.

Mascherano 7.5

Playing in his best position in front of the back four. Mopped up well.

Iniesta 7.5

Came good on his pre-match promise and made City suffer. Excellent close control.

Rakitic 7.5

A fresh face in midfield. Showed his importance by scoring the first goal.

Messi 9

He toys with his opponents like a matador with a bull. A true genius at work.

Neymar 8

Struck fear into City when he ran at them. Went past Sagna like he wasn’t there early on.

Has found a magic formula for the front three and solidified the defence.

Manchester City (4-4-1-1)

Hart 8.5

Must have felt like he was playing on his own at times. Kept City in the tie.

Kolarov 7

Put in a good shift. Did his best to get forward and tested Ter Stegen from distance.

Sagna 6.5

Embarrassed early on by Neymar but recovered well to put in a tidy shift.

Manchester City's Yaya Toure seemed overrun in midfield

Demichelis 7

No longer looks miles off Kompany. Was solid in the heart of CIty’s defence.

Kompany 6.5

Still not back to his best. Had a tough evening dealing with Messi and co.

Nasri 5

The Frenchman was lucky to stay on the pitch after an assassin-like tackle on Neymar.

City captain Vincent Kompany had a difficult night dealing with Barca's forward line

Fernandinho 6

Was helpless against Barcelona’s on-rushing attacking trident. Lunged too much.

Toure 6.5

Seemed overrun in midfield. Needed to get into the final third more.

Milner 6.5

Worked hard but was completely outclassed trying to contain Messi.

Silva 7

Feels like a luxury item when out of possession, but was still a threat on the ball.

Aguero 7

Looked sharp and bright, but isolated and smothered out of the game. Bad penalty.

Subs

Bony (for Toure 72, 6) Lampard (for Milner 87) Navas (for Nasri 46, 6.5) 

Not used: Caballero, Zabaleta, Fernando, Dzeko.

Manager

Pellegrini 7

Good decision to not play two strikers — his team stayed in the game until the end.
