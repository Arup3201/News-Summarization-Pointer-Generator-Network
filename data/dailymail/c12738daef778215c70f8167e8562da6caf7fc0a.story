To the lonely would-be agent preparing for a mission behind Nazi lines, the glamorous Frenchwoman with the confiding manner offered the enticing prospect of some friendly female company.

But the elegantly-dressed journalist who haunted the bars of upmarket hotels in wartime England was not all she seemed.

‘Marie Collard’ was an agent provocatrice employed by British spymasters to test out trainee agents before they were sent out to occupied Europe.

And, as her official file released today reveals, she all too often succeeded in getting them to ‘spill the beans’ and blow their cover stories.

Files: Marie Chilver in later life. She was an agent provocatrice employed by British spymasters to test out trainee agents before they were sent out to occupied Europe

After retiring from the service, Agent Fifi – as she was codenamed – lived quietly in the Forest of Dean, devoting her time to animal welfare and tending her garden. She died in 2007.

Now nearly 70 years after the war, her existence as a spy has been confirmed. Her file is among 3,300 intelligence and security documents from the Second World War being made available for the first time online by the National Archives in Kew.

Collard was not her real name, but part of an elaborate false identity created by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) – Britain’s Second World War sabotage organisation.

Born Marie Chilver – the daughter of an English father and a Latvian mother – she first came to the attention of the SOE in 1941 after escaping from a prison camp in France and helping a badly-injured RAF airman escape back to England.

She was given the job of testing trainees at SOE’s ‘finishing school’ at Beaulieu to see if they were capable of maintaining their cover stories.

A report from October 1942 noted that she was perfectly suited for targeting trainees in ‘expensive or flashy hotels and bars’ to see if she could get them to talk – and all too often succeeded.

One hapless agent, codenamed Parker, ‘never showed any signs of suspicion at all’, she reported.

‘Throughout the conversation he does not seem to have been aware that he was being questioned methodically and maliciously, although I tried to make it as obvious as possible.’

Fifi eventually began to feel sorry for those she had deceived with her ‘obvious and primitive trap’. ‘I am at times inclined to think the use of so malicious a ruse distasteful,’ she wrote.

But she insisted there was an ‘absolute fairness’ to her methods, arguing that it would help trainee spies to ‘outwit all the Fifis they are likely to meet in their future career’.

‘Compared to what is most likely to happen in the field, it is very mild and innocent. It would be a pity to have to give up this method, because it does give the students a good chance of using their brains (or just their low cunning),’ she wrote.

Trainees later got wise to her methods, and a report from September 1943 noted that many students ‘resist her blandishments’ and only open up when they realise the exercise is over.

When MP Hugh Dalton was given the role of heading up the Special Operations Executive, Winston Churchill told him to 'set Europe ablaze'

After France fell to the Germans in 1940, Churchill set up the Special Operations Executive (SOE), a new unit designed to operate with resistance movements behind enemy lines.

The SOE was charged with bringing chaos and death to Nazi armies across the continent. When Hugh Dalton was appointed head of the organisation, Churchill told him to 'set Europe ablaze'.

Operating out of two family properties on Baker Street, throughout late 1940 the SOE began recruiting new agents and purchasing properties across the UK to train them in.

While the senior staff was almost entirely made up of Oxbridge graduates, the agents themselves included a chef, an electrician,  and the daughter of a Brixton motor-car dealer.

Film-makers and makeup artists were installed at The Thatched Barn, a property in North London, to work on disguises, while at The Frythe, near Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire university graduates worked on ingenious weapons.

Between them, these two teams created the single shot cigarette pistol, hollowed out tree trunks used to store radios, a camel dung roadside bomb, and carborundum - a grease designed to lock up the wheels of trains.

By mid-1941, the SOE were operating inside France and their first real success came in June when they blew up the Pessac power station in Bordeaux, halting production at a German U-Boat factory and bringing the region's electric trains to a standstill.

However, other security services were hostile towards the SOE. The head of the Special Intelligence Service branded them 'amateur, dangerous, and bogus'.

Despite this mistrust, the SOE went on to prove vital to the war effort.

In 1942 agents assassinated Himmler's deputy, Reinhard Heydrich, using a grenade. The same year they also destroyed the Gorgopotamos rail bridge, cutting Rommel's desert army off from reinforcements.

The following year agents also destroyed the heavy water plant at Vemork, ending the Nazi atomic programme, and on D-Day in 1944 they used carborundum to halt trains bringing 2nd SS Panzer Division to the beaches.

In total their attacks delayed the crack division by 17 days, by which time the Allies had gained a firm foothold in France. 

After the war the SOE was left without a clear role. Facing internal hostility from other security services, and with their biggest champion Winston Churchill voted out of office in 1945, the unit was disbanded in 1946.
