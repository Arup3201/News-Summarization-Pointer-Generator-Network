Claims: Kate Bleasdale has accused her former chairman Alan Walker of touching her breast

A nurse turned entrepreneur is suing a
company she founded for £12million after alleging her former chairman 
groped her on a night out.

Kate Bleasdale, 51, who left nursing 
to build up a multi-million pound business empire, founded medical 
recruitment company Healthcare Locums in 2003, but was sacked over 
problems with the company’s finances.

The twice-named ‘Entrepreneur of the 
Year’ started the business with £2.2million compensation she was paid 
after winning a sex discrimination claim against Match Group, another of
her companies, in 2002. It went on to become Britain’s biggest medical 
recruitment firm.

But mother-of-four Miss Bleasdale is 
pursuing Healthcare Locums for sex discrimination, claiming her former 
chairman touched her breast twice and felt her leg during a meeting in a
London bar.

She is also claiming unfair dismissal 
after she says she was unfairly blamed for a financial crisis that 
engulfed the company, leading to £10million losses. She was executive 
vice chairman of Healthcare Locums.

In her evidence to a central London 
employment tribunal, Miss Bleasdale described how her former chairman 
became increasingly hostile towards her after behaving inappropriately 
at a meeting in a London bar.

She said in her witness statement to 
the tribunal: ‘Alan Walker was pretty drunk when he arrived. He sat on 
my right side, and touched my right breast twice during the meeting. He 
also touched my leg and grabbed my hand on a couple of occasions during 
the conversation.’

The hearing was told that she sent an 
email to a colleague the following day that read: ‘Was it me or was Alan
Walker being a bit frisky last night?’

The email was accidentally copied to 
Mr Walker, whose subsequent behaviour towards her became increasingly 
hostile, she said. ‘Following this, there was a notable change in Alan 
Walker towards me.

'He became hostile, dismissive, and 
critical of the investor relations... In effect he started the process 
of trying to take over my job.’

Miss Bleasdale was suspended and 
subsequently dismissed from the company in 2011 after ‘serious’ 
discrepancies with the firm’s accounts threatened its reputation.

But she laid the blame with the 
then-financial director Diane Jarvis. Miss Bleasdale claims she was 
sacked to protect the reputation of the other board members.

The hearing was also told that 
colleagues interviewed as part of Miss Bleasdale’s disciplinary 
procedure were asked whether she was an alcoholic and what she spent her
money on.

Under cross-examination, Miss 
Bleasdale admitted joking with board members about suing her colleagues 
for sex discrimination, months before launching her legal claim.

The businesswoman was also accused of 
using inappropriate language in accusing Mr Walker of being ‘frisky’, 
and it is alleged on a separate occasion she suggested two strip clubs 
as suitable places to take clients.

She told the hearing the use of the word ‘frisky’ in fact underplayed Mr Walker’s behaviour.

Miss Bleasdale has dropped her 
individual case against Alan Walker but her complaints about his 
behaviour remain part of her sex discrimination case against the 
company. She paid him £6,000 in legal costs.

The case continues.
