The controversy over the death of Boris Berezovsky took a bizarre new twist today as the president of Belarus appeared to claim the tycoon might still be alive.

Asked if he believed the Russian mogul, a prominent enemy of Vladimir Putin, was dead, Alexander Lukashenko replied: 'Absolutely not. Ab-so-lu-te-ly not'.

Exile Berezovsky's inquest in Berkshire last month found that he had died in March 2013 aged 67 after suffering a ligature wound to his neck in a bathroom at his ex-wife's luxury property in Ascot.

While evidence pointed towards suicide by hanging, the coroner Peter Bedford returned an open verdict arguing he could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the colourful former billionaire either took his own life or was unlawfully killed.

In a new interview with a Russian TV channel, Lukashenko - who personally knew Berezovsky - said: 'He so much loved to live, he loved life.

'And not only a good life - he was ready to live anywhere, in a cave, in a den, as long as he could live.'

He appeared to dismiss suggestions that 'someone' was involved in his death or that 'he hanged himself, as people say now'.

Told by interviewer Ksenia Sobchak - a family friend of Putin's - that 'a lot' of people do not believe in Berezovsky's death, Lukashenko said succintly: 'I am one of them.'

Revealing that Berezovsky had made secret visits to Belarus apparently with Russia's knowledge - despite Moscow seeking his extradition from his safe haven in London - the Belarus leader, dubbed Europe's 'last dictator' said: 'He could not commit suicide.'

He stressed: 'I am absolutely sure. No-one can change my mind about it, because I know it.

'I know this man, every cell of him. He was not the kind of man who could have done it.'

Intriguingly, the normally reclusive Lukashenko suggested he knew more but refused to give details on camera, though he discounted claims that Russian secret services were involved in Berezovsky's fate.

Speculation has swirled around suggestions that Berezovsky could have been murdered by a Russian hit squad, while the Moscow media has claimed MI6 could have made him disappear.

Lukashenko said that when they met he assured Berezovsky he would not hand him over to the Kremlin, though isolated Belarus is economically dependent on Russia.

'I will certainly not surrender a Jew who has come to our country,' said the president, who claimed the tycoon liked to travel to Belarus to 'embrace the white birch tree' he associated with his Russian homeland which he could no longer visit.

On one trip, believed to be in 2008, he said Berezovsky had come to Minsk with his British friend Lord Bell, former political confidante and PR guru to Margaret Thatcher.

Coroner Mr Bedford told the Windsor inquest: 'I am not saying Mr Berezovsky took his own life, I am not saying Mr Berezovsky was unlawfully killed.

'What I am saying is that the burden of proof sets such a high standard it is impossible for me to say.'

The tycoon was said to be a 'broken man' after losing a £3 billion London court battle with fellow Russian moneyman Roman Abramovich in 2012.

A key Kremlin insider under Boris Yeltsin, Berezovsky fled Russia after being a key player in Putin's rise to the presidency.

He inquest heard Berezovsky - who had survived two assassination attempts - fell into a deep depression after the court case.

The coroner said: 'It is clear to me and the witnesses I have heard that it had a significant effect not only on his finances but also on his mental health.'

Police did not find any evidence of foul play.

Forensics experts declared he died at his own hands but a professor called by the family to give evidence claimed his wounds meant he could have been strangled.
