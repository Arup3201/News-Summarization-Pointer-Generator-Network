Louis van Gaal refused to be drawn into a debate over whether Wayne Rooney has the right temperament to captain Manchester United after the England striker was sent off for a wild challenge at Old Trafford.

Click here for Matt Lawton's match report from Old Trafford.

Rooney received the sixth red card of his career for lashing out at Stewart Downing with a lunge that was almost waist-height and left his United colleagues to defend for a 2-1 win over West Ham with 10 men for more than half an hour.

But Van Gaal not only dismissed any suggestion he might have made a mistake making Rooney captain but argued, quite bizarrely, that he was guilty of nothing more than a professional foul.

A straight red for violent conduct will result in a three-match ban for Rooney, meaning he will miss the clash with Chelsea on October 26.

Asked why he saw it as a professional foul when Downing was deep in West Ham’s half, and if he shouldn’t have made Rooney captain, the Dutchman snapped: ‘For me, that is neither a good analysis by you and neither a good question.’

Asked then if he intended to answer the question, he said: ‘It is my right not to [answer].’

Phil Neville: ‘It’s a reckless tackle. There’s no reason even to make the foul because of the position the defenders are in.’

Ruud Gullit: ‘He could have just tripped him but he just lashes out. Sometimes he gets these moments in his career – like when he missed the first games with the national team (at Euro 2012).’ 

Rooney had opened the scoring with the 175th league goal of his career, moving him ahead of Thierry Henry into third place in Premier League scoring behind Alan Shearer and Andy Cole.

Van Gaal added: '(It was) the right card for Wayne. I could imagine why he did it.

'But I think you have to do it more friendly and that is the only thing that I can say. I call that a professional foul.

'Maybe you don't want to hear it but in professional football you make professional fouls.'

Opposite number Sam Allardyce gave a more balanced view. ‘It looks cynical,’ said Allardyce. 

‘Whether it’s a red card or not according to the rules, he just stopped him.’
