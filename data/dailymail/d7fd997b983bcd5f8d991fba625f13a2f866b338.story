Defence firms have been caught trying to charge the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds for Christmas parties, magicians and even ‘anticipated car accidents’.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has uncovered a string of startling claims submitted as part of multi-million-pound defence contracts.

He said firms had got away with billing the Ministry of Defence for ‘inappropriate activities’ because they did not have to provide a breakdown of what their charges were for.

Such profligacy, however, will be squeezed under a spending deal agreed between Mr Hammond and Chancellor George Osborne over the weekend.

A review ordered by Mr Hammond  has revealed extraordinary examples of ‘expenses’ which firms attempted to charge to the taxpayer, but have now been rejected.

They included £16,500 for ‘depreciation costs for executive flats’ and £25,000 for ‘cake, flowers and catering for a commissioning ceremony’.

Other examples included £9,500 for ‘staff team building’, £650 for ‘2 x magicians’, £24,000 for ‘mugs for a launch ceremony’, £200 for ‘attending Christmas party’, and £8,000 for non-specified ‘entertainment’.

Perhaps the most bizarre attempted charge under a defence contract was £50,000 for ‘anticipated car accidents (two a week at £500)’.  Defence sources said that it appeared many such claims were waved through without proper checks under the last government.

Meanwhile, the Chancellor said yesterday he had reached agreement with Mr Hammond over the MoD budget for 2015-16 as part of the Coalition’s spending review, to be unveiled on Wednesday.

There will be up to 2,000 further job losses among civilian personnel working for the ministry, but front-line servicemen will be protected from further cuts.

Mr Hammond is also proposing a new independent watchdog to ensure that the taxpayer receives value for money from lucrative defence contracts which are currently not put out to tender.

A system dating back more than four decades allows UK companies to bid for some military contracts without competition, on the grounds that they are sensitive to national security.

Mr Hammond said: ‘It’s vital that we get value for taxpayers’ money in times of increasing financial pressures  … Increased transparency on single-source contracts will help ensure tight resources are being spent properly while still allowing industry fair profits.’

Mr Osborne told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that he had now finalised a settlement with the MoD over its spending plans for 2015-16 after months of semi-public wrangling.

The deal will mean between 1,000 and 2,000 further job losses – but no further reductions in military manpower.

Furthermore, around £250million in fines from banks guilty of rate-rigging will be used over the next 25 years to support troops and veterans.
