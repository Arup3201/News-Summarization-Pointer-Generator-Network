The Boston Marathon bombing
trial jury on Thursday saw the remains of a pressure-cooker bomb
that prosecutors say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hurled at police during a
gunfight four days after the bombing.

Jurors also got a chance to see jihadist files
recovered from his laptop.

The bomb, described as similar to the twin bombs set off at
the race, was extracted from a Honda Civic in which it embedded
itself on a Watertown, Massachusetts street after Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, detonated it during
the gunfight.

The pressure cooker was the same type as was used in the
bombs that killed three people and injured 264 on April 15,
2013, said Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Brian
Corcoran, though the pieces found in Watertown were more intact
than those discovered at the race's finish line.

The Boston bombing jury was shown images of a pressure cooker bomb that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly threw at police during a shootout in the neighborhood on Watertown

The pressure cooker bomb in Watertown was lodged into a Honda and was more intact than the two found at the Boston Marathon finish line

The lid of the device landed two houses away, in a local child's hockey goal

Pieces of the bomb shrapnel were found on nearby roofs, lawns, and lodged in the siding of homes up to a block away

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if he is convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he and Tamerlan, 26, tried to flee Boston

'Those pieces were typically more fragmented, more cut up,'
Corcoran testified in U.S. District Court in Boston, looking at
both the main pot and its lid, which was found halfway down the
block from the blast site, in a child-sized soccer goal in a
home's side yard. 'This was a better representation of the
pressure cooker as a whole.'

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if he is
convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and
shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he
and Tamerlan, 26, tried to flee Boston.

The Watertown gunfight in the early hours of April 19, 2013
ended when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hopped into a black Mercedes and
attempted to run over three police officers who were trying to
arrest Tamerlan. The officers jumped out of the way but Dzhokhar
ran over his brother, who was briefly caught up in the vehicle's
wheels and dragged.

Tsarnaev's lawyers opened the trial early this month by
bluntly admitting he carried out the bombing and shooting. Their
goal is to convince the jury that the plot was driven by
Tamerlan, with Dzhokhar a junior partner in the scheme. Proving
that could persuade the jury to sentence the younger brother to
life in prison without possibility of parole, rather than death.

The jury was also shown images of a Samsung laptop, which was found in Watertown along with Tamerlan's high school diploma

Several jihadist materials were found on Dzhokhar's laptop and orange flash drive, including an article on how to make homemade bombs

Another FBI agent testified that investigators recovered
several apparently jihadist documents on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's
laptop, including at least three copies of Al Qaeda's 'Inspire'
magazine, one featuring a cover story headlined 'Make a Bomb in
the Kitchen of Your Mom,' and another brochure-type document
titled 'Jihad and the Effects of Intention Upon It.'

The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29,
graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean
Collier, 27, was shot dead three days later.

Separately on Thursday, Middlesex County District Attorney
Marian Ryan said her office would pursue murder charges against
Tsarnaev for the shooting of Collier, following his current
trial on bombing charges.

Ryan's office may also soon confirm whether a transit police
officer badly wounded during the gunfight was hit by friendly
fire. Local media have reported that the officer, Richard
Donohue, was wounded after Tamerlan Tsarnaev had run out of
bullets in the one working firearm the brothers had.

'The written investigatory report concerning the Laurel
Street incident is anticipated to be completed within two
months,' Ryan said in a statement. A spokeswoman said the report
would include 'ballistic information' but declined to confirm
whether it would address how Donohue was wounded.

The jury earlier in the trial heard testimony about how
Donohue nearly bled to death, though prosecutors asked no
specific questions about who had fired the bullet that wounded
him.
