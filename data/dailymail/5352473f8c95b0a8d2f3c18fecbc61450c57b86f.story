A man who had an affair with a 20-year-old woman when he was only 14-years-old learns he is a father eight years later and that he owes $15,000 in life support despite being a victim of statutory rape.

Nick Olivas, now 24, didn't know that statutory rape existed when he was a teenager and therefore he didn't press charges against the 20-year-old.

The Arizona Republic reports that Arizona State law says that sex with a child under the age of 15 is not consensual under any circumstance making Olivas a rape victim.

Victim: Even though Nick Olivas is a statutory rape victim because he had sex with a 20-year-old when he was 14-years-old he still owes money in child support

However, because Olivas did not press charges and the woman was not found guilty of sexual assault, Olivas is found viable for child support.

Two years ago, the state served Olivas with paperwork saying that he owed money to his six-year-old daughter.

'It was a shock,' he said.

'I was living my life and enjoying being young. To find out you have a 6-year-old? It's unexplainable. It freaked me out.'

At first, Olivas tried to ignore the legal documents and didn't take the paternity test required of him.

The State eventually found him and was able to take money from his bank account.

He owes about $15,000 in medical bills and child support from when the baby was born in addition to 10 per cent interest.

Forced to pay: Nick Olivas, who is now 24, is forced to pay child support because he never pressed charges when he was a teenager

Olivas has said that he wants to be involved in his daughter’s life but that doesn't want to be financially responsible.

Anything I do as an adult, I should be responsible for. But as a teenager? I don’t think so… I was living my life and enjoying being young. To find out you have a 6-year-old? It’s unexplainable. It freaked me out.

The director of the national Center for Men told the Arizona Republic that Nick Olivas is suffering because he is a man.

'The idea that a woman would have to send money to a man who raped her is absolutely off-the-charts ridiculous… It wouldn’t be tolerated, and it shouldn’t be tolerated.

We’re not going to hold him responsible for the sex act, so to then turn around and say we’re going to hold him responsible for the child that resulted from that act is off-the-charts ridiculous… It makes no sense,' he said.

Olivas wants to fight his case in court but unfortunately, he cannot pay for a lawyer.
