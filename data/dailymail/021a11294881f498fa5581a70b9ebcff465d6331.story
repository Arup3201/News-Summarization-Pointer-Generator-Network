Tragic: Alfred Wright, 28, pictured with one of his two young sons, was found half-naked and partially mutilated in the Texan outback

The FBI has launched an investigation into the death of a physiotherapist who vanished and was found dead in a desert three weeks later missing an ear, teeth and tongue.

Alfred Wright, 28, was last seen at a petrol station near his home in Texas on November 7 as he drove to visit a patient.

His disappearance sparked a large-scale manhunt, but police closed the case after two weeks.

Days later, the father-of-two's family found him half-naked and mutilated in the East Texas outback where police claimed to have looked.

Now, after two pathologists gave conflicting reports - one found the death to be an accident; another ruled Mr Wright suffered 'severe trauma' - the federal bureau has taken over the case, according to CNN.

The family has also issued an appeal for any information about what they believe is a 'suspicious murder' that was motivated by race.

They said married Mr Wright called his parents asking for a lift from CL&M Grocery in Jasper, Texas, because he had problems with his truck.

By the time they arrived at 6pm, he had vanished.

His watch and ID were found on a ranch the next day, which police searched and found nothing.

The sheriff is said to have ruled there was 'no foul play' and attributed the death to drugs.

Eventually, he was found wearing boxer shorts, tennis shoes and just one sock, with his phone tucked inside.

He was missing an ear, two front teeth, and his throat appeared to be cut.

His father, Dominic Wright, told CNN: 'He was neatly laid. His tennis shoes were very clean. Neat.

'This is the first thing I noticed: how smooth his forearms and his back was. No scratches at all.'

An autopsy found the mutilations were caused by animal and insect activity.

The coroner ruled the cause of death to be accidental caused by combined drug use after a toxicology report found his body to be filled with cocaine and methamphetamine.

Family members claim Mr Wright never did drugs.

Last night, US Rep for Texas Sheila Jackson announced the case has been handed to the Texas Rangers and the FBI for closer examination.
