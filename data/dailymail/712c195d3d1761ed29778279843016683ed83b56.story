Harry Kane is the closest thing England has to Alan Shearer, according to Newcastle head coach John Carver.

The Magpies boss knows Shearer better than most having been assistant to Ruud Gullit and Sir Bobby Robson at St James' Park and is close friends with the former Three Lions captain.

And Carver says Spurs hotshot Kane – the 21-year-old who has scored 22 goals already this season – reminds him of the Geordie legend.

Carver worked with Shearer at Newcastle during his time as assistant to Ruud Gullit and Sir Bobby Robson 

‘He’s probably the nearest thing that we’ve seen to an Alan Shearer in a long time,’ he said.

‘I think it’s great, first of all, to see a young lad come through the system. He’s an honest and hard-working, but talented, boy.

‘I think he’s got a level head. He speaks well in front of the camera, and I think he’s got a good personality.

‘His first priority is how hard he works in a game. The ability comes secondary. If he continues to develop, he’s got a bright future.’
