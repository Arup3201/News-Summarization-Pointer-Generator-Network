Prime Minister Tony Abbott obviously forgot to refer to the Socceroos' teamsheet on Saturday when he awkwardly referred to Australia's captain Mile Jedinak as 'Mike' in a cringeworthy World Cup video message.

The patriotic-looking PM, sporting a Socceroos scarf and standing before the Australian flag, delivered his stirring message of support to the Socceroos in a YouTube message on Saturday morning as they prepared to play in their first World Cup match.

But as if a 3-1 defeat to Chile wasn't bad enough, the PM only managed to make it to the three-second mark before butchering his well intended message by referring to team captain Jedinak, as 'Mike', instead of Mile.

Draped in Green and Gold and the Australian flag in the background, the stage was set for Mr Abbott who just needed to do bit more research before delivering his message

Thankfully he didn't also have a problem with the coach, Ange Postecoglou.

'Ange, MIKE and the Socceroos,' he said, 'in this World Cup you have the opportunity to make the world game our national game'.

He went on to say that the weight of a nation rests on the Socceroos' shoulders and that the side, no matter how well they perform on the world stage, will have the country's full support.

'Throughout this Cup we'll burn the midnight oil as you take the field in our name.'

'We stand with you as you wear our colours into the world's greatest team sporting event.

'We're behind you, we're willing you on to victory and we know you'll seize the moment.'

If only the PM had seized the moment to get the skipper's name right.

So close, yet so far: Tony Abbott was just one letter in the alphabet away from getting the socceroos captains name right
