They do say it's lonely at the top, so France's new president Francois Hollande must have been grateful for a helping hand from German chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday.

Mr Hollande was the guest of honour at a red-carpet ceremony in Berlin, but the French newcomer looked decidedly out of his element - understandably nervous as the world watched the first meeting between Europe's new power duo.

It was an ominous first day for Mr Hollande, having been soaked through by a torrential downpour during a parade in France, and then arriving late for his meeting with Mrs Merkel after his plane was struck by lightning and had to be diverted.

This way Francois: While French president Francois Hollande looks decidedly awkward - his arms rigidly by his side like a naughty schoolboy - German chancellor Angela Merkel shows him the way

No no, this way: Mr Hollande seems to be off in all directions outside the Federal Chancellory in Berlin, but Mrs Merkel patiently points him in the right direction or offers a helpful tap on the arm

On the ground, he stood on the wrong side of the red carpet and fidgeted constantly - with Mrs Merkel giving him a helpful push in the right direction.

Later, as Mrs Merkel spoke of her determination to keep up the Franco-German cooperation that flourished under Mr Hollande's conservative predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr Hollande fumbled in his pocket for pen and paper to take notes.

When it came to his turn at the microphone, Mr Hollande repeatedly used hands and arms to stress how reasonable his arguments were.

Shoulder charge: When hand signals would not do the trick, Mrs Merkel resorted to a good old-fashioned barge to get Mr Hollande moving in the right direction

We made it: By the time the two leaders had finally found their way to waiting reporters, it looked like Mr Hollande had relaxed a little bit - to the relief of Mrs Merkel

Off to a bad start: Mr Hollande's excessive hand gestures and talk of amending Mrs Merkel's European policies did not endear himself to the German chancellor

While the two leaders talk about wanting to continue the status quo between their two countries, a body language expert might have had more to say on Mr Hollande's intentiions.

At one point, Mr Hollande explained why he wanted to tamper with Mrs Merkel's fiscal pact, agreed by 25 European states, to make it more growth-oriented.

Mrs Merkel simply shrugged and smiled at reporters.

The German leader and Mr Sarkozy were so different in character that aides thought they would never get along.

Still chucking it down: Mr Hollande endured more outdoor ceremonies in the rain yesterday as he placed flowers at the monument to the Unknown soldier at the Arc de Triomphe

This never happened to the other guy: Mr Hollande looks like he might be regretting his decision to run as French leader after his inauguration

Mrs Merkel, a physicist from the former East Germany who guards an intensely private home life, seemed polar opposite to Mr Sarkozy - dubbed 'President Bling-Bling' because of his flashy tastes and marriage to self-promoting singer/model/actress Carla Bruni.

But the two conservatives saw eye-to-eye on the euro crisis to such an extent that media commentators lumped them together as a single entity - 'Merkozy'.

However, it might take some time before the world starts hearing of 'Merkollande'.

Mr Hollande's first day in office was not so much a baptism of fire as it was a baptism of water - and lightning. The man dubbed ‘Mr Normal’ by the French endured a first 24 hours in charge that were anything but normal.

The day started well enough, with the new leader exchanging pleasantries with outgoing president Mr Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace - and being sworn in as the seventh president of the Fifth Republic.

But it all went downhill from there. Poking through the sunroof of a small £25,000 hybrid Citroen DS5, and surrounded by guardsmen on horse-back, he was driven up the Champs Elysees waving to well-wishers.

But - in weather that could have only been choreographed by Mr Sarkozy himself - the heavens opened and rained heavily on Mr Hollande’s parade.

By the time he arrived at the Arc de Triomphe, he was a mess; his black suit and white shirt clinging to his body, and water dripping uncharismatically from from his spectacles.

If he thought things would improve when he boarded his plane to meet Mrs Merkel, he was wrong. His Falcon 7X was hit by lightning and he was forced to return to Paris, to board a second aircraft.
