Given that there are 41 independent coffee shops in the area, there is clearly an appetite for the occasional cappuccino.

But when Costa Coffee announced plans to open a branch in Totnes, it left a very bitter taste.

Residents feared the arrival of the chain would ruin the south Devon market town’s identity and turn it into a ‘clone’.

So determined were locals to keep 
Costa off their picturesque medieval streets that the town, which has a 
population of 8,336, produced a petition of almost 6,000 signatures and 
held protest marches and meetings.

And three months later, in a rare  
triumph of people power over big business, the ‘No to Costa’ campaign 
has scored a remarkable victory.

Yesterday the chain announced that 
fierce opposition from residents had forced it to abandon its plans for 
a 70-seat cafe in the town.

In a statement on their website, the campaigners said they were ‘absolutely delighted’ by the company’s decision to withdraw.

5,000 local people signed a petition to stop Costa building a coffee shop in the town as residents pride themselves on independent coffee shops, right

They continued: ‘We are impressed 
Costa has taken the time to understand our town, its economy and the 
5,700 people who signed the petition asking Costa to reconsider.

‘This is a major milestone for local communities and is a day when the value of localism comes into its own.’

Brasserie owner Tony Kershaw  said: ‘We’re happy with the decision Costa has made.

‘Totnes is pretty independent and different as a town, and we’re seeking to protect that.’

Costa’s climbdown was announced in a 
letter from the company which was also signed by Conservative MP Sarah 
Wollaston and Totnes mayor Pruw Boswell – who thanked the  coffee giant 
‘for being prepared to  listen to our concerns and showing that they 
care’.

Dr Wollaston said: ‘Costa have considered all the issues and decided that they will not come to Totnes.

Result: Brasserie owner Tony Kershaw said: ¿We¿re happy with the decision Costa has made. Totnes is pretty independent and different as a town, and we¿re seeking to protect that'

‘I welcome that decision and want to thank Costa for being prepared to listen to those concerns.’

The coffee shop had been given 
planning permission by South Hams District Council – but that decision 
was greeted by a 150-strong group of placard-wielding demonstrators who 
marched through the town’s streets.

The anti-Costa campaign was also 
supported by former resident and author Joan Brady, who once won a 
literary award from the Whitbread group which owns the coffee chain.

Of Costa’s 2,344 British stores, 19  are in Devon, where it employs nearly 200 people.

The chain recently reported its 42nd consecutive quarter of growth, with profits of £36.1million.

Earlier this month, the founder of 
Costa said it had too many branches. Italian-born Bruno Costa, 70, who 
created the company with his brother Sergio in the 1970s, likened the 
chain to supermarket monolith Tesco and said Costa had taken over in his
home town of Purley, Croydon, where a sixth branch is due to open.

Before the dramatic retreat, a 
spokesman for Costa had insisted the company would ‘aim to complement 
the local offering and support the local community’ in Totnes.

Against Costa: The town boasts 41 independent coffee outlets and is well-known in the South West for its 'alternative' image

But in yesterday’s letter, managing 
director Chris Rogers wrote: ‘In all communities in which we operate, we
seek to be a force for good, contributing to growth, creating jobs and 
supporting our local community.

‘In making this decision Costa has 
recognised the strength of feeling in Totnes against national brands and
taken into account the specific circumstances of Totnes.

‘Totnes is a town with a long and 
proud history of independent retailers. It has one of the lowest 
percentage of branded stores of any town of its size in the UK, very few
empty shop fronts, as well as a very high proportion of places selling 
coffee.’

Campaigner Martin Turner said he was ‘flabbergasted’ by the ‘good sense’ the firm had shown.

The manager and owner of Tangerine 
Tree Cafe said: ‘We are delighted. We are an independent town and we 
don’t want a clone high street.’

Ian Gregory, co-owner of Fat Lemons 
Cafe, said: ‘It’s surprising that they’ve made the decision after 
everything seemed to be set. I’ve never heard of a big company like 
Costa doing anything like this before.’
