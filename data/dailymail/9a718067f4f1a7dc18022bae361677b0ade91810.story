Making it rain: Serge Vorobyov, pictured, ended up getting arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after throwing $1,000 in dollar bills into the mall

A Minnesota man was only trying to spread the love when he threw $1,000 in dollar bills from the fourth floor of a mall this Black Friday.

But Serge Vorobyov ended up getting arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.

Vorobyov, who goes by the YouTube handle 'Serge the Car Hauler,' chucked the cash from the Mall of America rotunda in Bloomington as a choir performed 'Let it Snow' on the ground floor below.

He said he tossed out the cascade of bills because he'd had a rough year, including a messy divorce, and just wanted to help make others' dreams come true on the biggest shopping day of the year.

'People think it's an evil number, I thought it was supposed to be a lucky number,' he said on YouTube video explaining the event.

'I had a really tough year. My story is that I just threw out my last thousands dollars.

'I don't have enough money for a lot of things and I'm going through a horrible divorce she even took the cat and won't tell me where it is.

'I thought I'd just spread some holiday cheer, be positive, and kind of like pay it forward and make it snow money. I thought it'd be fun.'

But Bloomington police did not share his vision of yuletide cheer. They arrested him and charged him with disorderly conduct.

A Mall of America spokesman told CBS News Vorobyov's actions could have caused a major disturbance and ended in someone getting hurt.

He was, however, released when it was confirmed there were no injuries.

'I think all the people down there enjoyed it,' Vorobyov said. 'I know I enjoyed it, I thought it was fun.'
