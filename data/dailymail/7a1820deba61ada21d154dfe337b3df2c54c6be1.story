A bloody family street brawl in Melbourne's north has left six people hospitalised with injuries understood to have been received after they were hit with a pole.

Emergency services were called to Roxburgh Park at about 1am on Thursday, following reports from residents who were woken by angry men and screaming women who were covered in blood in the middle of the street, the Herald Sun reports.
