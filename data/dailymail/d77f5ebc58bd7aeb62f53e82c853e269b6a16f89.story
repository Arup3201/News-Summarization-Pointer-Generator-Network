Read his views on 'Big Cheese' Matt Prior 

I did NOT text South Africans ways to get Strauss out

Flower's regime led to cliques (and Trott telling Prior and Swann to 'f*** off') 

Flower was a 'f****** horrendous' 'Mood Hoover' 

Kevin Pietersen has denied that he was a villain for England, alleges that Andy Flower wanted to build a team of 'Boy Scouts' and brands former team-mate Matt Prior the 'Big Cheese'.

The former England batsman was sacked by the national team in January after the Ashes debacle Down Under and claims he was made a 'scapegoat'.

In KP: The Autobiography, Pietersen says that he was 'often naive and sometimes stupid. I was no villain, though.'

Pietersen has also accused former coach Andy Flower and ECB chief Giles Clarke of wanting the England team to be 'like Boy Scouts'.

He wrote that the England management wished to oversee a 'sweet bunch of eager Boy Scouts who never did anything wrong on or off the field. Keen young gentlemen. Always perpetrated. They wanted us to win in a certain way.'

While admitting he didn't always tread wisely, the 34-year-old insists he was picked on by former coach Flower, whom he labelled 'f***ing horrendous' and a 'Mood Hoover'.

Pietersen says he was made a 'scapegoat' as a distraction during England's travails.

His reasons for this were that he 'had a little history', was 'big, boisterous and annoying' and left 'colourful footprints on the pristine white carpets'.

Pietersen also insists that Flower distrusted individuals such as himself.  

'Individuality reflected badly on Flower's reputation as a leader', he added.

Despite this, England did pick some 'individuals', so Flower apparently decided he would have to 'come down hard on them' so he could 'retain some sort of power'. 

A lot of Pietersen's ire is reserved for wicketkeeper Matt Prior, whom he dubs 'the Big Cheese'.

In a chapter entitled Le Grand Fromage, the former batsman says he gave his erstwhile team-mate that moniker as he was 'a Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie'.

Pietersen says Prior's reign as vice-captain of England was one of terror and double standards.

He also says the former keeper would scream at fielders for shelling catches, with Pietersen also accusing him of 'schoolyard bitching'.

The pre-Ashes training camp was described as a shambles, while Prior was ridiculed for taking his own bike on a tour of New Zealand and 'grassing on a younger player for having a few drinks in India.' 

Pietersen also mocked Prior's cycling kit, saying he'd get into his Team Sky uniform 'looking like Clark Kent'.

He wasn't the only South African-born batsman to have problems with Prior, apparently.

The normally mild-mannered Jonathan Trott snapped at Prior and Graeme Swann after the bowler and keeper had given the batsman a rollicking for misfielding in Bangladesh in 2010.

Trott blasted: 'Will you f*** off? Who the f*** do you think you are?' 

This was a regular occurrence in the 'clique-ridden' England dressing room under Flower, says Pietersen. 

However, he strenuously denies that he sent South African friends tactical information on how to get Andrew Strauss out in the Textgate storm which engulfed English cricket in 2012.

The scandal started KP's downfall as an England player and, he says, was a direct consequence of Strauss 'obnoxiously' ignoring him after scoring a century.

Pietersen alleges his former captain didn’t acknowledge him after he hit 149 during the second Test in South Africa two years ago.

That led to a friend in the South African side BlackBerry Messaging the batsman asking what his captain’s problem was.

However, Pietersen stresses he did not text anyone in the Proteas team but refused to come out in public and say it.

‘It suited the ECB to use the messages as evidence of my open rebellion against Straussy,' he says. 

Pietersen also moves to set the record straight on the term ‘doos’ – thought to be Afrikaans for ‘c***’. 

He wrote that the friend called Strauss a ‘doos’, meaning a ‘d***’ or ‘idiot’, sentiments the 34-year-old agreed with.
