A teenager whose girlfriend died next to him in a hotel bed after her prom night allegedly choked the girl during rough sex the night of her death.

Eddie M Herrera, 18, reportedly told police 'I put my hands around her neck and squeezed' in a drunken passion, then passed, only to find Jacqueline Gomez, 17, unresponsive when he woke.

Herrera, who allegedly told detectives about the act, and stressed the choking was consensual, and also said the two had been popping hydrocodone, a narcotic pain pill, in the Hyatt Hotel in North Houston, Texas, last summer.

Caused her death? An autopsy was unclear as to whether choking or an overdose of alcohol and pills were to blame. Herrera has been charged with aggravated assault

An autopsy was unable to determine whether the choking or an overdose killed Jacqueline. According to the Houston Chronicle, she had deep hemorrhaging all the way around her neck.

Herrera has been arrested charged with aggravated assault because of the severity of the apparent wounds, and appeared in a court today.

He remains in jail over the death, on May 17 last year, and had bail set at $50,000.

Jacqueline was reported missing by her parents the morning after the MacArthur High School prom, which was also in the Hyatt hotel, as they had expected their daughter to come home that night.

Prosecutors said that Herrara first called his mother - who helped book the hotel - when he realized Jacqueline was unconscious.

She allegedly later came to the hotel, dressed Jacqueline then asked hotel staff for a doctor. They then allegedly called 911. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Herrera, who was arrested Wednesday, faces life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors are deciding whether to charge his mother as well.
