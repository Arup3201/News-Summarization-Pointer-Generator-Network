Confession: Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke has admitted the firm  failed to change fast enough to help customers during the economic downturn

Tesco has admitted it failed to help customers during the economic downturn as it announced it will cut prices on everyday food essentials by some £200million.

It is also introducing a ‘Fuel Save’ scheme to cut living costs where holders of its Clubcard will be able to earn savings of 2p-20p a litre on petrol based on spending.

Britain’s biggest supermarket has also pledged to improve quality and bring forward a refurbishment of hundreds of its ‘big box’ stores.

It will spend millions developing its website which is now generating food sales of £2.5billion a year and a trading profit of £127million.

This will involve opening hundreds of new ‘click and collect’ points for food and other web purchases in stations and other locations.

The moves come as the company tries to turn around a slump in sales and market share with shoppers deserting to cheaper budget rivals – Aldi and Lidl – as well as Waitrose.

Chief executive Philip Clarke told investors that the company had failed to change fast enough to help the ‘squeezed middle’ and low income households during the financial crisis.

‘It has been tough for consumers and it’s been tough for the company. Our headline results are not where we want them to be,’ he said.

‘I have not seen such a level and sustained pressure on consumers in my 40 years. The squeeze continues. There are signs of confidence in the UK economy but consumers are not yet seeing that being translated into spending power.

‘The least affluent customers and middle income families are being forced to make choices.’ 

He added: ‘Businesses which don’t change with the times don’t succeed and we did not change enough, not enough for our customers. But now we have changed.’

Cuts: It comes as Tesco has announced it will cut prices on everyday food essentials by some £200million

Mr Clarke said the giant, which takes around 30p in the £1 of all spending on groceries, had wrongly become locked into a mindset that ‘big is best’.

He said the firm’s bosses now accept this is not automatically the case. In fact, sales through its big stores were down by 3.1per cent in the crucial Christmas period.

As a result, it has decided to dramatically cut back on building new stores and will, instead, divert cash into major refurbishments.

The success of the price cuts initiative will depend on whether customers trust the store to deliver

This will include installing coffee shops, family restaurants and bakery shops into many of its biggest large stores, using the brands, Harris & Hoole, Giraffe and Euphorium.

Prototype stores in Watford, Purley and Coventry, which also have Tesco F+F fashion boutiques, pharmacies and opticians, will be used as the templates for the new look interiors.

The company opened some 2.5million square feet of new floor space in this country in 2012-13, however that will come down to just 700,000 in 2014/15. Most of this new space will be in convenience stores as people switch away from one big weekly shop to making several trips.

Mr Clarke said the company will do away with ‘frivolous’ price promotions to a regime of permanent lower prices on food essentials bought every week.

He said: ‘Prices must get better and must be more stable. Frivolous promotions must end and trusted ones should be in place and that will start now.’ 

The success of the price cut initiative will depend on whether customers trust the store to deliver.

The firm promised reductions of £500m in the ‘Big Price Drop’ in 2011, however subsequent surveys found many of the reductions were not what they seemed.

Mr Clarke said he had he regretted the way that promotion was implemented, saying: ‘It was not executed well.’ 

He insisted the company has now undergone a fundamental change in philosophy, adding: ‘People will not be fooled and we are going to deliver what we have said.’

Competition: Shoppers are increasingly deserting Tesco in favour of budget rivals Aldi (pictured) and Lidl

The UK managing director, Chris Bush, said price cuts on everyday essential foods have been brought forward specifically to match the low figures at firms like Aldi and Lidl.

The national Fuel Save scheme, which will be a permanent money-saving measure, has proved popular during trials in Wales and Norwich. 

Customers who spend £20 earn a discount of 1p a litre on fuel at Tesco petrol stations. Drivers can choose to save up their discount over several shops to the point that they might earn a saving of as much as 20p a litre.
