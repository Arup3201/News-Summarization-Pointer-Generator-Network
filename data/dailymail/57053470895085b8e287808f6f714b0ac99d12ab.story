Three weeks after he was forced out, the founder of American Apparel has come to an agreement with the company and has been rehired as a ‘strategic consultant’.

Dov Charney, 45, was sacked last month from the company he founded when he was 20 with
 the board citing his alleged misuse of company funds and role in 
disseminating nude photos of an ex-employee who filed a case against him
 in 2011.

‘Mr. Charney will serve as strategic consultant until the end of the investigation. Based on the findings of the investigation, the committee will determine if it is appropriate for Mr. Charney to serve as CEO or an officer or employee of American Apparel,’ American Apparel officials said in a statement.

Dov Charney will keep his large salary of $832,000 during the investigation into his alleged behaviour

The deal also stated five of the seven board members, including Mr Charney, will step down voluntarily. Only Allan Mayer and David Danziger, the current co-chairmen, will remain on a new board. The company said there is an ongoing investigation into the founder’s alleged misconduct, which is overseen by an independent board committee.

Mr Charney has described the allegations as false and insisted he is still the 'best man for this job'.

As part of the deal the Los Angeles Times reports that Mr Chaney is forbidden from accessing the company's computer systems. He will keep his salary - $832,000 a year - during the investigation.

Dov Charney has accused the board of American Apparel of conducting a 'hateful campaign' against him

In an interview he gave after being fired, Mr Charney told the Financial Times: 'I think it's highly unusual that a board - any board - would indulge in such a hateful PR campaign against its founder.'

American Apparel most recently said that they decided to sack Mr Charney based on information that he allowed an employee to impersonate and post naked photos online of a former worker who sued Mr Charney in 2011 for $260million after she claimed that he forced her to be his 'sex slave'.

The case was dismissed in 2012 but the former employer was subject to an online campaign to discredit her, and Mr Charney is now facing claims he failed to stop it.

The New York Post
 has reported that Canadian Mr Charney was expected to say that he did not know about the 
blog before it was published online and therefore isn't responsible for 
the 'liabilities' cited by American Apparel.

Mr Charney's
 lawyers have pointed out that the board renewed his employment in April
 2012; more than a year after the blog was published.

Irene Morales, 21, said that Charney allegedly made her his sex slave and new information states Charney may have allowed an employee to impersonate her online

In the letter to the board lawyer Patricia Glaser said the company had failed to give Mr Charney 21 days' notice of his severance package as required by law, making his dismissal 'not only unconscionable but illegal.'

A link to the letter, whose receipt the source familiar with the matter confirmed, was provided in an article on the Wall Street Journal's website.

The letter threatened legal action should Mr Charney not regain his executive positions.

The management shakeup followed years of stagnation, as the company amassed more than $250million of debt.

The
 company's co-chairman, meanwhile, has also said that the company 
was not for sale and that the search for a new chief executive had 
generated 'enormous interest'.

Allan Mayer also told Reuters that American Apparel did not need immediate capital.

He said: 'We are certainly not looking to sell the company.

'If
 someone came and said they want to buy American Apparel for $10 per 
share, we'd be crazy to not listen ... but by no means looking to sell 
now.'
