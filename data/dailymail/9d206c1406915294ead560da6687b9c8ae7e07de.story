'There are barbershops, people selling goods, chefs cooking food and kids running around - all within inches of the tracks.

‘The locals know when the train is coming so they all move out of the way - it is a part of their routine. Old men will sit on the tracks all day.

‘Then, as it approaches four or six o'clock, they get up, move their chairs a metre away from the track and continue talking while the train goes past.

‘When the track is clear they move back into the middle.’

More safety measures required: Railway-related accidents account for 2 per cent of all deaths annually in Vietnam

Cutting through: Many deaths occur at illegally-built crossings with no barriers or warning signs. There are an estimated 5,000 illegal railroad crossings in Vietnam

Knowing when to move: The photographer said that people sitting on the track move away when the time approaches four or six o'clock

Knowing the timetable: When the track is clear after a train has passed, local residents move back into the middle of the line
