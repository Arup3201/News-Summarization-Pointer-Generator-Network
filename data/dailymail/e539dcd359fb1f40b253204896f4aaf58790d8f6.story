Brendan Rodgers has hailed Philippe Coutinho as the 'brain of Liverpool's team' after impressing in their pre-season friendlies to date.

Rodgers has been delighted with the Brazilian's form in their opening fixtures against Brondby, Preston and Roma adding that the 22-year-old is the focal point for the Reds.

All smiles: Rodgers has been delighted with the Brazilian's form in their three pre-season matches so far

Coutinho has contributed eight goals and 15 assists in 50 appearances for the Anfield outfit in all competitions, but it's his overall ability that has impressed his manager.

'Coutinho is the brain in our team, the continuity player. He might not score many goals, but he's a wonderful reference for the team,' Rodgers told the club's official site. 

'He is the one that gets the team ticking, gets the movement in front of the ball. He goes and gets on the ball. He's a fantastic talent for such a young player and he's still gaining his fitness.

'He makes the crowd get off their seat. For someone so small, he's very tough and robust. He's a wonderful technician that has a great idea, tactically, of the game.'

Coutinho, who has a further four years left on his present deal with Liverpool, will be looking to further stake his claim in Rodgers' first-team plans on their pre-season tour of America before their opening Premier League match against Southampton on August 17.
