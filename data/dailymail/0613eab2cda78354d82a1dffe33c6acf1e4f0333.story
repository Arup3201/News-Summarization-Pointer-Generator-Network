Rising Labour star Chuka Umunna has claimed Parliament is 'quite a sexist place' – and complained about the number of people who cannot say his name properly.

The shadow business secretary, tipped as a future Labour leader, revealed that he had heard female MPs being mocked about low cut tops and their appearance in the House of Commons chamber.

He added that if he had taken people mispronouncing his name personally he would have gone 'insane a long time ago'.

Mr Umunna dismissed claims he is preparing to throw his hat in the ring to take over from Ed Miliband should Labour lose the election – insisting he was 'dying' to win the election in May

Mr Umunna made the remarks after being mocked for referring to 'Worcester' in the West Midlands as 'Wichata' – a city in Kansas, 4,000 miles away in the US.

Explaining the gaffe, the Labour MP said: 'I thought, my gosh, if I went as mad as everybody has gone about me mispronouncing Worcester when people mispronounce my name, I would have gone insane a long time ago.'

The Labour MP for Streatham, south London, has previously said his name should be pronounced: 'Chook-ah. Uh-mun-a. Think 'snooker'.'

Mr Umunna dismissed claims he is preparing to throw his hat in the ring to take over from Ed Miliband should Labour lose the election – insisting he was 'dying' to win the election in May.

In an interview with Red Magazine, he said: 'It is quite a sexist place. You don't hear it on the TV, but some of the comments made in the chamber when some of the women get up and speak …

'And sometimes there have been instances when – I think it's happened to female colleagues – they have been sitting behind the front bench and wearing a slightly low-cut top, and the whole of Westminster has gone mad about it, which is quite insulting.'

Mr Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said he had overheard female MPs being harassed about their low-cut tops

The frontbencher, who was only elected to Parliament in 2010, dismissed criticism that he was too 'smooth'.

He said: 'When I was growing up my father said, 'When you go out, dress properly and look the part because, before you open your mouth, how you present yourself is important'.

'And so, I don't understand all this 'smooth,' 'charming,' all this business, because it's like ... 'Should I be badly dressed and rude to people?'

The frontbencher, speaking to the Women's magazine Red, also dismissed criticism that he was too 'smooth'

Asked about his ambitions to be party leader, the shadow business secretary said: 'I don't really think about it. I'm just dying for us to win the general election.'

Mr Umanna's father was a Nigerian immigrant who married a British solicitor after moving to the UK to start a business.

But he was killed in a car crash in Nigeria when Mr Umunna - the MP for Streatham – was 13.

Speaking about his father's death, he said: 'I've known fear in my life. I've lost a parent so I have a strong sense of my mortality.

'It was hard. And it happened when I was 13, so you have to grow up quickly. You've got to get on with life. The last thing he would have wanted us all to do is to crumble.

'He was a larger-than-life character, determined and focused. And I think that's where I get my drive from.

'He drilled it into me that if you want to succeed – if you want to do what I've done and come from nothing to be something and be successful – you've got to work damn hard.'

Mr Umunna has also gone further than most Labour MPs attacking Ukip.

He said: 'The things candidates for UKIP have said about people of colour and eastern Europeans, a lot of it is quite racist in my view.'

The full interview appears in the March issue of Red, on sale 29th January. Also available in digital edition on Apple Newsstand.

Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has demanded an end to the 'sniping' about Ed Miliband.

Lord Kinnock said attacks from the Tories were not as damaging as criticism from Labour allies.

The intervention comes after two former Cabinet ministers Alan Milburn and John Hutton attacked Mr Miliband for running a campaign in Labour's 'comfort zone'.

They warned it could lead the party to an election defeat like in 1992 when John Major defeated Kinnock's Labour.

But Lord Kinnock said the Blairite attacks on Mr Miliband's election strategy had been 'so great that it requires a response'.

He said he had received messages from Labour figures about Mr Milburn's attack 'to the effect of asking, "doesn't he know we've got an election on?" — in much the same spirit as people used to say, "don't they know there's a war on"?'

The peer added: 'The problem is never really the assaults from opponents. Certainly, it's not a problem by comparison with sniping from behind. That's a distraction.'
