Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair faces being called to give evidence in Parliament about the letters to on-the-run IRA suspects

Tony Blair faces being called to Parliament over a secret deal with Sinn Fein which allowed suspected IRA bombers to avoid prosecution.

The former Prime Minister is set to be summoned by the Northern Ireland select committee to explain the controversial 'comfort letters' sent to on-the-run suspects telling them they were not being sought by the police.

MPs are warning that if he fails to appear there will be 'bad publicity'. 

The policy led to the collapse of the trial of suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downing in March.

The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Mr Blair's Labour government saw around 200 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities.

The letters did not rule out future prosecutions if new evidence emerged.

The Northern Ireland committee is investigating the deal after the collapse of the case against Downey, who was accused of the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombing which killed four soldiers.

In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young.

Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace.

But the case against Mr Downey collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK.

The committee has taken evidence from senior police officers in Northern Ireland, and Labour politicians who served as Northern Ireland Secretary in the Labour government.

Mr Blair is understood to have provided written evidence to the committee, but could be called to appear in person to answer questions direct from MPs.

Committee chairman Laurence Robertson told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘Mr Blair has not found a date in his diary.

‘We are going to have to press him. Technically we can compel him to attend.

‘I don’t want to have to get to that point yet but others on the committee will want to do that.

‘There is going to be bad publicity … if he doesn’t come because people will draw their own conclusion.

‘I take the view Mr Blair has a duty to come and explain it. He is right at the thick of it.’

Mr Blair’s office has previously suggested the sticking point has been finding a suitable date to fit in with his role as a Middle East peace envoy and when the committee is sitting.

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: 'Tony Blair has already given evidence in person to the Hallett Review and has said he is happy to also give evidence to the Committee, we are in discussions about the best way to do that given the current demands of his Middle East role.'

The spokesman said they did not know anything suggestions Mr Blair could appear via video link. 

On Thursday the results of another inquiry into the affair, led by Lady Justice Heather Hallett, will be published.

Lady Justice Hallett's report is expected to address secret negotiations between Mr Blair and Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, on how to deal with "on-the-run" suspects.

Because they had not been convicted, they did not fall within the scope of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which saw jailed paramilitaries released early. 

For
 more than 30 years, John Downey had the IRA bombing in Hyde Park 
hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice.

extradition largely based on fingerprint evidence on parking tickets.

November 21, 1989
 - The then attorney general Sir Patrick Mayhew considers Downey's case 
and decides the finger print evidence is not compelling enough to seek 
extradition.

June 1991 - a review by Scotland Yard backs up the decision not to seek extradition.

1993
 - Scotland Yard decide: ‘The subject is not extraditable but is 
obviously arrestable should he be detained within the UK 
jurisdiction...’

From July 1998
 - as part of the extended negotiations between the British government, 
Sinn Fein, and the Northern Ireland government, the names of 187 On The 
Runs (OTRs) - including Downey - can be submitted by Sinn Fein for 
checks whether they are wanted by authorities in Northern Ireland or in 
the UK.

@highlight

July 20, 2007
 - Downey, 62, of County Donegal, receives a ‘letter of assurance’ that 
he is not wanted in Northern Ireland or the UK when in fact there is an 
outstanding warrant against him in the UK. The letter is sent by the 
Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) on behalf of the secretary of 
state for Northern Ireland and the attorney general. The letter 
reassures Downey that he can visit his son and grandchild in Canada. He 
also travels several times to the UK and Northern Ireland.

@highlight

2008 -
 a chain of emails between two PSNI officers indicates that the PSNI 
knew that Downey was wanted over the Hyde Park bombing by the 
Metropolitan Police and that this was not mentioned in the 2007 letter. In
 the summer, before travelling with his wife to Canada, Downey contacts 
the Canadian authorities for a temporary residence permit. He says: ‘The
 reason for the above application is that I served a term of 
imprisonment in Portlaoise prison in the Irish Republic in 1974...I was 
named in some British newspapers as being responsible for the Hyde Park 
& Regents Park bombings in 1982, which I strenuously deny. No 
warrant was ever issued by the British authorities to have me extradited
 and I understand from contacts which have taken place between British 
and Sinn Fein that they, the British, have no further interest in me. I 
have strongly supported the peace process from the very beginning of the
 talks and I believe that the only way forward for all people on the 
island of Ireland north and south is in peaceful co-operation and mutual
 respect and understanding for each other...’ The application is 
granted.

2009 -
 Downey visits Londonderry and Belfast in his role to promote greater 
understanding between Republican and Loyalist ex prisoners.

May 19, 2013
 - Downey is arrested at Gatwick Airport en route to Greece. He 
allegedly told police: ‘I am surprised that this had come up as I have 
travelled in and out of the UK on a number of occasions to see family 
and I have travelled to Canada from Dublin. When I went to Canada I 
contact the UK government to check it would be OK as I didn't want any 
problems. They said that would be fine.’ He is subsequently charged over
 the murder of four British soldiers and causing an explosion.

January 2014
 - a trial date is listed at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Sweeney. 
Instead, Downey's defence team launch an 11th hour bid for the case to 
be thrown out due to an ‘abuse of process’.

@highlight

February 2014 -
 Trial judge Mr Justice Sweeney throws out the case because of the PSNI 
error in sending the letter and not correcting the false impression it 
gives Downey. The final ruling was handed down on Friday February 21 but
 could not be reported until the prosecution had decided in discussion 
with the Attorney General not to appeal.
