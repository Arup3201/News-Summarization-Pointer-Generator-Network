A 27-bedroom Gothic mansion transformed into an exclusive retreat at a cost of more than £2million is up for rent - costing £10,000 for a weekend getaway.

Businessmen Chris Badham and Damian Llambias bought Huntsham Court near Tiverton, Devon, for £1.83 million in January and have spent a further £400,000 on refurbishments.

Now holidaymakers or wedding planners can book two nights at the impressive 19th century home, costing up to £10,900 for 27 of its luxurious bedrooms.

Mr Llambias balanced work in the arts with a career in property development in London while Mr Badham was a high-flying barrister.

They realised there was a gap in the market for a venue like Huntsham Court when they tried to track one down for their civil ceremony.

Mr Badham said: 'There have been times when you write cheques for £10,000 and you don’t know if you’ll manage to get events in.

'You think ‘I hope it’s not a one-way street.'

Huntsham Court, which was completed in 1869, was designed by the architect William Burges for the Ackland Troyte family.

Costly: So far the new owners have spent £400,000 on the property as part of their ten-year refurbishment plan for the estate

In more recent years, author Douglas Adams worked on his book ‘So Long and Thanks for all the Fish’, part of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series, while at Huntsham.

The house has five main receptions rooms with period features as well as a butler’s pantry and a vaulted octagonal kitchen.

It has a Great Hall with original Jacobean Oak panelling, a working library, and drawing room.

Mr Badham and Mr Llambias  are part-way through a ten-year refurbishment plan for the house and grounds.

They have 58 weddings booked for next year and seven for 2014.
