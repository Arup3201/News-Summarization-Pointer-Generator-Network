Luiz Felipe Scolari appeared to criticise the performance of Howard Webb last night, after the English referee controversially disallowed a Brazilian goal by Hulk for handball and refused to give the host nation a penalty in the first half.

The pre-match confrontation between Chile and Brazil had been dominated by the choice of Webb, with the Chileans fearing he would feel pressurised to favour the home nation and the Brazilans worried that the feeling they were being protected by FIFA would lead referees to be reluctant to give them decisions.

Unhappy: Brazil coach Scolari argues with Webb and the fourth official Felix Brych after the decision

Handball: Webb indicates why he disallowed Hulk's strike which looked to have given Brazil the lead

Good call: Although on first viewing the goal looked legitimate, Webb rightly spotted Hulk's handball

Webb made two major calls - both correct - refusing to give Brazil a penalty on 13 minutes when Mauricio Isla challenged Hulk and disallowing a goal scored by Hulk on 54 minutes for handball.

And Scolari said: 'If you don't want us to be champions, OK. But it must be the same for everyone.

'If it's a penalty, it's a penalty. It's a foul, it's a foul. If it's a goal, it's a goal. And thing are starting to get weird here.

'My players are a little tense with everything that is going on. Everyone has been saying - coaches, players - that it's always Brazil that's wrong.

Protest: The Brazilian forward was convinced his goal should have been allowed to stand

Outrage: Hulk complains to assistant referee Michael Mullarkey but the English officials got it right

'That's not true. Some errors and doubts and controversial issue regarding penalties and hand balls, everybody is mentioning that. It's not always for Brazil, right?'

Brazil have been dogged by the accusation that they are favoured by FIFA as the home nation ever since they were awarded a soft penalty by Japanese referee Yuchi Nishimura in the opening game.
