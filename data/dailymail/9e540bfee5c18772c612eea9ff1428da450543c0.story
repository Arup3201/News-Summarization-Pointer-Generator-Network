A rabbit hunter died after being shot in the head when his shotgun trigger snagged on the zip of his boot, an inquest has heard.

Father-of-two Carl Rubisch, 30, died of a single gunshot wound after the gun fired as he got out of a Land Rover to shoot a rabbit.

He and friend Stuart Forrest, 30, were on an organised night-time shooting trip on farmland near Brockton, Shropshire, when the tragedy happened.

Father-of-two Carl Rubisch, pictured with wife Fay, died from a single gunshot wound during a rabbit hunt

Mr Forrest told the inquest he turned the lights off on his Land Rover before using a powerful torch after spotting a rabbit 80 yards away.

He said: 'I stepped out of the vehicle and Carl went to get out.

'I
then heard a shot and looked around and realised something was wrong. 
Carl was standing by the Land Rover door, he turned to look at me and 
let out a groaning sound.

'Carl
then slipped and was lying on his back. I asked him where he had been 
hit but he did not respond, so I put him in the recovery position and 
went to get help.'

Tribute: These flowers were left on farmland in Brockton where Mr Rubisch is believed to have accidentally shot himself during the hunt

Desperate: Mr Rubisch's friend ran to a nearby house to call the emergency services but paramedics could not save him

After the gun went off Mr Forrest ran to a nearby house and the homeowner dialled 999 but paramedics were unable to save Mr Rubisch, who died at the scene

Shooting expert Robert Griffiths told the hearing that Mr Rubisch probably accidentally killed himself during the incident on April 5.

He said: 'I fired the firearm a 
number of times during testing and found the trigger pull was lighter 
than expected, at 500g, but not necessarily dangerous.

'I
was called to examine Mr Rubisch’s Wellington boot that had a zipper, 
which was near the top, more or less done up and sticking out at 90 
degrees.

'I carried out a series of tests, 
rubbing the rifle up against the boot, and found it was possible for the
zip to engage with the handle and fire the gun.

Sad: Neighbours near the family home in Lichfield, Staffordshire where the couple lived with their two children, said they had been married for under a year and Mrs Rubisch was 'inconsolable' at losing her 'soul mate'

'I
have come across similar incidents with police or the soldier equipment
where triggers have been caught, but I have not come across this 
before.'

Recording a verdict of accident death, John Ellery, coroner for mid and north Shropshire, said: 'Mr Rubisch was clearly an experienced sportsman and rifle shot, who was safety conscious.

'He had no worries or problems and had simply gone out hunting with his friend.

'The accident happened within moments of him getting out of the Land Rover to take a shot.

'What I am left with following the reconstruction is the trigger was accidentally activated by the zip.

Liked: Friends said Mr Rubisch was a 'happy go lucky guy'

'That explains the entry point and the 
path of the bullet. It’s plausible and fits the evidence. The path of 
the bullet also followed the tragic set of circumstances.'

Shooting enthusiast Carl leaves behind a widow, Fay, 29, and two young children, Callum and Phoebe.

The couple only got married in June last year.

Mr Rubisch was a keen shooting fan and was a member of the British Falconers Club which was set up to preserve ancient field sports of hunting with trained birds of prey.

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Fay,
who married Mr Rubisch in June last year, was described as being 
inconsolable after losing her 'best friend and soul mate'.

One
resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Carl loved his shooting -
just like his father who is a member of the British Falconers Club.

'I couldn't believe it when I heard what had happened. He is a sensible lad so I can't imagine they were messing around.

'I've seen Fay and she seems absolutely inconsolable. She has lost her best friend and soul mate - they only married last year.

'They were looking forward to enjoying the rest of their lives together. It's an absolute tragedy.'

Following his death, friends also took to social networking sites to pay emotional tributes.

One
friend, called Pugs Ley posted on Facebook: 'I just like to say to Carl
Rubisch and his family my thoughts and prayers are with you fay and the
family.

'I always remember Carl as a happy go lucky kind of guy. And I always like that about him. We always had fun together.

'My heart goes out to Fay And the family
and if there is anything I can do please don't hesitate to ask I love 
you. And my thoughts are with you always.'

Another family friend Alex Brown wrote: 'Not the greatest of sleeps last night, so gutted for Fay Rubisch and her kids as well as the family and close friends of Carl, RIP fella always a good person.'
