Taken from reels of never seen before home movie footage, it offers a rare glimpse of the Queen and her family in relaxed ‘off duty’ mode.

From a gangly Prince Philip racing his son, Prince Charles, on a children’s tricycle, to a young Princess Elizabeth dancing a sailor’s reel with her mother, the ageing cine film is a charming record of happy days gone by.

Now it is among the highlights of a 
new exhibition at Buckingham Palace – Royal Childhood – which opens to 
the public tomorrow.

In one clip of the never before seen royal footage, the Duke of Edinburgh can be seen on a child's tricycle leading Prince Charles around on toy tractor while playing.

In another clip, Her Majesty The Queen poses for a photograph while a very young Princess Anne appears distracted with the object in her right hand

The footage also reveals a very young Prince Charles, dressed in shorts and a t-shirt, proudly showing sticks to the camera as he plays in front of Buckingham Palace

The treasured family film, much of which was shot by the Queen and Prince Philip themselves and comes from their personal collection, is incredibly touching.

Although the Windsors have suffered more than their fair share of family heartache and fractured relationships in recent decades, the footage shows the Queen and her husband were once hands-on parents – as much as their busy official schedule allowed, anyway.

A hilarious Prince Philip, wearing a suit and dark sunglasses, can be seen borrowing Princess Anne’s red and white tricycle, in a clip that is believed to date back to 1953.

Pedalling furiously along one of the palace terraces, the Queen’s husband is followed in hot pursuit by Prince Charles on a three-wheel tractor given to him by toy manufacturer Tri-ang that was known to the family as ‘Major’.

Determined Anne, dressed in a white summer dress, then takes her treasured tricycle back off her father to show off her own skills on the lawn. 

In the ageing cine film, a young Princess Elizabeth (left) can be seen dancing a sailor¿s reel with her mother (second from left) and a young Princess Margaret (right)

The foursome can be seen putting their best foot forward as they dance in pairs for the camera. The clip has been released as part of the Royal Childhood exhibition

A young Princess Margaret and Princess Elizabeth were also filmed dancing together without the adults, in the adorable home footage

This is the rocking horse President Obama sent Prince George to mark his birth last year.

The hand-made toy sports a presidential seal on its saddle and a polo mallet with a head made from the branch of an oak tree that once stood on the south lawn of the White House.

The Obamas also sent the baby prince a blue alpaca wool security blanket.

The gifts are on display at the Palace as part of the 'Royal Childhood' exhibit.

Other clips show the Queen affectionately offering a toy xylophone to her then toddler son, Charles, and playing peek-a-boo with a handkerchief. She also films a beaming young Princess Anne, sitting on a garden chair, with just two bottom teeth popping through.

One piece of footage is particularly poignant and shows the Queen’s adored, but frail, father, King George V1, sitting on a sun lounger and fondly placing his arms around his grandson, Prince Charles’s waist.

The future Prince of Wales, dressed in smart red trousers and a matching jumper, leans in affectionately and plays a toy drum hung around the neck.

The film was almost certainly shot just months before the King’s death in February 1952.

Footage of the Queen from infanthood to new mother herself, also features heavily in the exhibition.

As a carefree young girl she can be seen playing on a see-saw with her younger sister, Princess Margaret, throwing her head back in laughter as they go higher and higher, each trying to unseat the other.

The two 
sisters are also shown singing and dancing, surrounded by the family 
corgis, helping their mother to weed in the garden at Windsor and 
learning to ride.

One
 of the most charming segments, however, sees the two princesses, aged 
around ten and six, on board a royal yacht, possibly Britannia, showing 
off their new-found dancing skills for the camera.

They are subsequently joined by their mother – then Queen Elizabeth - and governess, Marion ‘Crawfie’ Crawford.

The young Elizabeth affectionately links arms with her smartly dressed ‘mama’ and shows her how to do the reel.

A young Queen Elizabeth mounts a horse in one segment of footage which will go on display together with more than 150 treasured toys, outfits and nursery items belonging to nine generations of children who have called the grand royal residence home

Princess Anne, who features as a toddler in much of the footage, appears happy and content as she plays with a toy in the treasured family video

The footage is on display together 
with more than 150 treasured toys, outfits and nursery items belonging 
to nine generations of children who have called the grand royal 
residence home.

Among them 
is a fully-operational, James Bond-style miniature Aston Martin DB5 – 
complete with smoke bombs and a pop-up bullet-proof windshield – given 
to six-year-old Prince Andrew and a rocking horse with a mallet carved 
from an ancient oak tree which once stood on the lawn of the White 
House, a gift to young Prince George from President Obama.

Queen
 Victoria’s ‘behaviour book’ records her as being ‘rather impertinent’ 
and sometimes ‘very horribly naughty’ and stands alongside the rather 
adorable soldier dressing gown worn by Prince Harry when he went into 
hospital at the age of three.

Other clips of footage - which will go on display as part of the exhibition - show the Queen affectionately offering a toy xylophone to her then toddler son, Prince Charles

After thinking about it for a few seconds, the very young Prince Charles picks up instrument and begins playing the xylophone while Her Majesty lovingly looks on

Anna Reynolds, a curator at The Royal Collection Trust, said at a preview of the exhibition yesterday: ‘It’s easy to forget that Buckingham Palace, now one of the most famous buildings in the world, was purchased as a family home [in 1762], and has remained so for over 250 years.

‘This exhibition gives visitors a very personal insight into life as a young member of the royal family over nine generations, through the toys the children have played with and loved, and through the clothes they have worn.

‘The cine footage comes from the Queen’s private collection and brings even more vividly to life the family aspect of a very public home.’

Royal Childhood can be seen as part of the annual Summer Opening of the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace from July 26 to September 28. For further details see wwwroyalcollection.org.uk
