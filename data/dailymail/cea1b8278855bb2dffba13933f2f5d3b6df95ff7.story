Cecil Parkinson’s love child may have cost him a chance to try for the Tory leadership, newly released files from the Margaret Thatcher archives have revealed.

The documents, which include his resignation letter, record the downfall of the man who the Prime Minister was widely thought to have considered her heir.

They reveal that Mrs Thatcher was secretly planning to appoint Mr Parkinson as Foreign Secretary, a move that would have kickstarted his rise to the top.

Instead, he informed her on the day of the 1983 election that he was having an affair with his former secretary, Sara Keays, and that she had become pregnant with his child.

Heart-felt: Cecil Parkinson's previously-unpublished resignation note and Mrs Thatcher's reply

The 30-year-old files have been released from the archives at Churchill College, Cambridge. They reveal the chaos that ruined Mrs Thatcher’s reshuffle plans.

Her notes from the time show that she intended to make Mr Parkinson Foreign Secretary, though her staff’s reshuffle documents suggest that they did not know about the idea.

Chris Collins from the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, the only historian to have studied the files, said she had essentially anointed him as her successor.

He said: ‘It’s only speculative that she considered him to be her successor but it would appear that she was very serious about him indeed.

Scandal: Sara Keays, former secretary and mistress of Cecil Parkinson. News of their affair and her pregnancy forced Parkinson to resign in October 1983

‘He had risen very fast and she knew that by promoting him in this way, she would create an atmosphere around him.’

The former party chairman told Mrs Thatcher about his 12-year affair on June 9, 1983, the day of the election.

How Diana stole the limelight

He wrote to her: ‘It seems strange that after over eight years on the front bench as part of your team, I am now to be a spectator of events rather than a participant in them.’

Mrs Thatcher later received a letter from Miss Keays’s father Colonel Keays, but she is believed to have burned the note in a fireplace at Chequers.

As a result of the news, she decided to delay the reshuffle by a day – and made Mr Parkinson secretary for trade and industry instead.

At the time, she wrote to Judge Alan King-Hamilton saying: ‘It has been a most difficult week – and such a sad ending for everyone.

‘These days it is not permitted to suffer one’s wounds in private. There has been no peace for Cecil and Ann [his wife].’

Mr Parkinson was forced to resign a few months later on October 14 after Miss Keays decided to publish a statement to ‘put the record straight’ regarding the nature of their relationship.

She wrote: ‘My baby was conceived in a long-standing, loving relationship which I allowed to continue because I believed in our eventual marriage.’

Flora Keays was born on New Year’s Eve 1983, although an injunction prevented her identity from being known or publicly reported until she turned 18.

She was diagnosed with learning disabilities and Asperger syndrome – and needed surgery to remove a brain tumour when she was four.

Mr Parkinson’s resignation letter and Mrs Thatcher’s reply were never published, possibly because they could have prolonged the embarrassing scandal.

However along with other documents they have now been made available to the public, and can be accessed online at www.margaret thatcher.org.

The files reveal that she replied to Mr Parkinson’s letter saying: ‘I am saddened beyond words both by the loss of your contribution as a member of the Government and by the tragic circumstances in which that loss has come about.’

But Mrs Thatcher also made it clear that she expected him to remain with his wife. Journalists at the time were suspicious that it had been Mrs Thatcher who prevented the couple from splitting up.

Mr Parkinson remained in his marriage – and returned to the government in 1987.

Douglas Wass, who was the first permanent secretary of the Treasury, told the Prime Minister in his leaving speech: ‘The Treasury has a splendid collection of Georgian silver.

‘When you heard this, your ears pricked up. I gave instructions that during your visit it was to be kept out of sight.

‘I now know what the monks must have felt when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries!’

Letter: John Nott praised the former PM's looks

John Nott wrote a letter paying tribute to Margaret Thatcher and her ‘good looks’ when he resigned as defence secretary.

He wrote: ‘It is inexcusable to say so nowadays, but I actually admire you as a woman – your good looks, charm and bearing have always attracted me, as a man.

'I’m sorry, but what is wrong with that!

‘I think your emotional, instinctive and unpragmatic approach to most issues – so very unmasculine – is the secret of your success in the male-dominated world of politics.’

Mr Nott did not receive a reply and although Mrs Thatcher marked, underlined and scrawled on almost every document she ever read, his letter was left blank.

He left the government in 1983 and was replaced by Michael Heseltine after being criticised over the 1981 defence white paper.

In his letter he wrote: ‘Your greatest triumph as a PM, if I may say so, is that your colleagues actually like you. Some of them even love you, just a little!’

He signed off the rather personal letter with: ‘Love – John.’

Margaret Thatcher may have been aware that Alan Clark was having an affair when she appointed him as a minister.

In a previously secret note to Mrs Thatcher, her principal private secretary Ian Gow urged her not to allow his dalliance with ‘this absurd girl’ to prevent the appointment.

The note does not spell  out who the girl is, but Mr Clark’s many affairs have been documented by  his biographer, who has had access to his personal papers.

Mrs Thatcher did not reply to the note, but Mr Clark received his first ministerial posting as a parliamentary under-secretary at the Department of Employment in 1983.

The serial womaniser  once described Mrs Thatcher as ‘very attractive,’ praising her ‘eyes, wrists and ankles’.
