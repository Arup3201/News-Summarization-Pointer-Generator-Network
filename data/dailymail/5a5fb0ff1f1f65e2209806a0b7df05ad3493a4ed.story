You know what you’re getting with the US Open: knee-high rough, putting greens like glass and the toughest test in all of golf. Hit it straight or you’re dead meat, right? Well, maybe not this year at Pinehurst.

Rather startlingly for the US Open there will be no rough. That’s right – none. Instead, Pinehurst’s fabled No 2 course has widened fairways, which bleed into waste areas featuring all sorts of funky hazards: sand, gnarled tree roots and hollows.  

Punters can usually feel safe backing steady, straight hitters at the US Open – think Justin Rose (28-1) or Graeme McDowell (50-1), two champions from the last four years – but the 114th edition of America’s national championship poses some different and difficult questions.

Repeat performance? Justin Rose is looking to defend his US Open title after victory at Merion last year

Challenging: The No 2 course at Pinehurst has no rough but large waste areas instead

Experience: Graeme McDowell, pictured playing out of the sand during a practice round at Pinehurst on Tuesday, won the 2010 US Open

The odd fairway hazards are not the only puzzle. Whereas US Opens usually feature thick rough surrounding the greens, at Pinehurst there will be nasty run-off areas with grass cut short to gobble up any approach shots even slightly off target. A centimetre here or there could be the difference between a birdie putt or a desperately tough up-and-down for par.

This will place extra stress on the players’ short games and makes wizards with the wedge such as Phil Mickelson (16-1) or Luke Donald (40-1) extremely tempting bets.

The greens will play as usual for a US Open – like greased lightning. A good week with the flat stick is essential for any winner of the year’s second major. Just ask Webb Simpson (40-1) or Jim Furyk (40-1), both past champions.

But if the key to this US Open is hitting the right spot on the greens then those who can bomb the ball a mile off the tee, hit more than their share of fairways and hit shorter into the greens could be the men to watch. Pinehurst No 2 is a par-70 of some 7,562 yards – that’s long. So step forward Rory McIlroy (11-1), Adam Scott (12-1), Bubba Watson (16-1) and Henrik Stenson (28-1). 

Magician: Phil Mickelson's short game could prove key at the 114th US Open this week

Precision: Luke Donald's natural ability on the greens should help him conquer Pinehurst

Bet NOW with Coral!

But the point about this US Open is that it seems not to favour one particular suit: Pinehurst promises to put each facet of every player’s game through the wringer. The last two champions, Michael Campbell (2005) and Payne Stewart (1999) won with 72-hole scores of even par and one under, so no-one is going to burn up these fairways.

The player who will get his hands on the trophy will need to shine from tee to green, possess the short game to bail him out of trouble when needed, have a proven ability to putt on superfast greens and have the x-factor to deal with the quirks of this classic course.

All of which points to Phil Mickelson (16-1). Lefty finished second at Merion last year, the sixth time he has done so. The 43-year-old Californian is without a top 10 on the PGA Tour all year but an 11th place at the St Jude Classic last week suggests he is peaking at the right time. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned from Mickelson it’s to expect the unexpected.

How much pressure the FBI’s investigation into his financial affairs has piled on his shoulders is impossible to know, but the Open champion is chasing a career grand slam and craves victory in this event more than any other. His time will surely come, and he looks a good bet to do it this week.

But if you’re looking for someone a bit more dependable, look no further than Stenson. The Swede has a poor record at the US Open but no-one hits the ball farther and straighter while not needing to take the risk with a driver. The world No 2 could barely miss a fairway or green while winning the money list titles on both sides of the Atlantic last season and has a dead-eyed putting stroke from six feet or so, crucial to saving pars. Stenson also has four top 10s in his last seven starts worldwide and is final edging back towards the form that made him nearly unstoppable in the second half of 2013.

So close: Mickelson has finished second at the US Open six times but has never won the tournament

Big hitter: Henrik Stenson (centre), who is available at 28-1, will be looking to use his distance off the tee

Finding his form: Rory McIlroy goes into the US Open as the 11-1 favourite

Another reliable, straight hitter worth a punt is Jason Dufner, whose US PGA triumph came on another Donald Ross-designed course at Oak Hill (although Pinehurst No 2 has undergone restoration by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw for this tournament). Dufner’s wedge and short iron play were also inch-perfect last August - exactly what is needed here – and a recent playoff defeat to Scott in Texas proves his top form is not far off.

At 40-1, Dufner is a better bet than Rose, who is unlikely to repeat his victory at Merion. While Rose is a wonderful player and in good touch, only Curtis Strange and Ben Hogan have pulled off back-to-back US Open victories in the modern era.

McIlroy is the favourite to win with good reason. His victory at Wentworth last month proved he can now win on courses where course management is crucial, as it will be at Pinehurst. The Northern Irishman won this event three years ago. And the world No 6 is absolutely striping the ball right now. At 11-1, however, his price might be just too short for any man not called Tiger.

Among the other favourites, Scott is in top form and will surely feature, but question marks hang over the world No 1’s putting stroke and short game after a relatively disappointing Masters defence. Watson won at Augusta, should benefit from the widened fairways here, and has been the best player in the world this year. But again his short game might be found just wanting. Jordan Spieth (25-1), the 20-year-old wunderkind Watson saw off for the green jacket, is likely to again fall just short at this early stage of his career.

In the frame: Australian Adam Scott, pictured during a practice round at Pinehurst, should be in contention come Sunday

New blood: Jordan Spieth is aiming to win his first major at Pinehurst after just falling short at the Masters

Finally, it might just be worth a cheeky wager on one of the short-game whizzes in the field at big prices. Victor Dubuisson (80-1) worked miracles at the WGC-Match Play Championship and Jonas Blixt (80-1) has wowed galleries in big events since his US PGA breakthrough last year and Simpson (40-1) is both a former champion and grew up playing Pinehurst.

But one man who quietly fancies his chances is Donald (40-1). The Englishman has been undergoing swing changes but should benefit more than most from the widened fairways. His irons and wedges are laser-guided, his putting almost unsurpassed and if he misses the green he is a genius from sand and short grass alike. Three of the last four US Opens have been won by Europeans, and if Donald drives the ball well he could be this week’s surprise package.
