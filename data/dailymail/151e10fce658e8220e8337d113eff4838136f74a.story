Veteran Today show presenter Willard Scott, 80, has tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend.

The TV star and Paris Keena were wed on Tuesday in Fort Myers, Florida. They have been together for about 11 years, Today host Matt Lauer said on Wednesday's show.

The jovial Scott, billed as the program's weather reporter and centenarian, has been a part of the Today line-up since 1980.

Today show colleagues posted this picture on Wednesday to congratulate Willard Scott, 80, and his new wife Paris on their wedding this week

Scott met his wife, who is believed to be 57, for the first time in 1977 when they both worked for TV station WRC in Washington.

They
 stayed in touch for years but got together 11 years ago. The couple 
split their time between Florida, Virginia and Connecticut.Â 

As for honeymoon plans, the new Mrs Scott told Today: 'Our whole life has been a honeymoon.'

Mr
 Scott, who turned 80 on March 7, was married to Mary Dwyer Scott from 
1959 until her death in 2002. He has two daughters Mary and Sally and 
two grandchildren, John and Sally.

Lauer framed the announcement as 'another surprise wedding' in the Today family.

Last
 month, co-anchor Savannah Guthrie made an on-the-air announcement of 
her marriage to communications strategist Mike Feldman two days earlier 
in her native Arizona.

She also told viewers she was four months pregnant.
