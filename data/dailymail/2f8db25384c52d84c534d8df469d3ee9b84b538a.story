Investigators have found the bodies of two unidentified people in the charred remains of an Annapolis-area mansion that burned to the ground earlier this week.

Anne Arundel Fire Department spokesman Capt. Russ Davies said cadaver dogs and searchers found the bodies. He said four people remain unaccounted for.

Tech tycoon Don Pyle, 56, lived in the 16,000sq ft home with his wife Sandra. Authorities are yet to confirm the deaths but a local headteacher sent out a letter to staff and students on Tuesday confirming the family had been killed and naming the grandchildren as Lexi Boone, Katie Boone, Charlotte Boone and Wes Boone.

Owner: Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren, according to a local headteacher. Authorities are yet to confirm all six died

'I never knew that I could hurt this badly,' Stacey Boone, mother to two daughters Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday.

'It’s unreal. All one big nightmare that I can’t wake up from.'

It is believed the other two children are the Pyles' grandchildren through another son.  

The bodies have been taken to the medical examiner's office in Baltimore for identification. Davies said he did not know how long it would take to identify the victims and determine their cause of death. He would not say whether the bodies were of adults or children.

The Pyles and their four grandchildren have been missing since crews were called early on Monday to the scene of the blaze, which reduced a 16,000-square-foot waterfront castle to ruins.

Investigators began excavating the ruins on Wednesday.

Davies was accompanied at the Wednesday news conference by several other officials, including Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Wes Adams, County Executive Steve Schuh, local police and fire officials and an agent from the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The fire was reported about 3:30 a.m. on Monday by an alarm-monitoring company and a neighbor who spotted flames. Officials said it is unclear whether an alarm sounded inside the home, which might have alerted anyone inside.

Some 85 firefighters from several jurisdictions fought the fire. Davies said because there was no hydrant in the area, firefighters shuttled tankers to the site and stationed a fire boat at a pier nearby.

Davies said hot spots took about 10 hours to extinguish on Monday. One area flared up on Tuesday, and Davies said crews were monitoring it and extinguishing it as needed.

Special Agent David Cheplak, a spokesman for the ATF's Baltimore field office, said earlier this week there were no immediate signs of foul play.

Sources at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives toldCNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning.

The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. 

Special Agent William McMullan said that specialists from across the country were headed to Annapolis, and would send in trained dogs to sniff out any traces of accelerant chemicals, which would help determine whether the blaze could have been a deliberate attack.

However, Capt. Robert Howarth, commander of the county fire department's fire and explosives investigation unit, said on Tuesday that investigators were treating the site as a crime scene.

Howarth said that is a common practice when there are no eyewitnesses, and it means only that anything recovered in the investigation would be admissible in court.

On Monday, all authorities would say is that six individuals including four children were unaccounted. They could not confirm whether they had died in the blaze, and continue to investigate. Relatives, employers, investigators and reporters have all so far failed to reach either of the Pyles.

Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people.'

In a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, firefighting officials said they are still looking for the six people. 

They would not speculate on whether the fire was deliberate - but also refused to describe it as an accident. He did, however, reveal that the gate to the property was left open at all times, and that the house had no sprinkler system installed.

Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies.

In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia.

He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted.

His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value.

Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty.

Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement.

Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture.

Though most of the fire appeared to have been extinguished by late Monday morning, some firefighters were still reportedly pouring water on the ruins at midday - almost nine hours after the fire started. Fire chiefs said they were not able to search the house during the blaze, and that it is unlikely they will be able to confirm whether there are any victims until later today.

ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic.

'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.'
