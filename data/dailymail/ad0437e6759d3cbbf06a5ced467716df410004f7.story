An England fan had his ear bitten off in a vicious attack by another supporter after the national side's World Cup loss to Uruguay.

The victim, believed to be England fan Robert Farquharson, was left with blood pouring down his neck after having half of his left ear lobe ripped off by a racist thug in the Arena Corinthians stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

The savage attack happened a week before Uruguay and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was banned from the competition for biting an Italian player - but details of the attack have only just emerged.

The attack happened after England fans, pictured, had watched Uruguay beat Roy Hodgson's men

A video which appeared on the Sunday People website shows the victim's neck covered in blood after he was set upon by a fellow England fan following the team's 2-1 defeat to Uruguay.

With his left ear horrifically injured, he turns and tells the camera: 'He bit my ear off and called me a black ****.'

Footage shows a scuffle unfolding in front of shocked supporters in the upper tier block 614 of the stadium.

Before long the argument descends into a fierce fight as stewards desperately try to intervene.

A man wrapped in England-themed fancy dress clothing tries to move out of the way as the brawl escalates next to him.

The frightened victim, who was wearing a white England top and red backpack, was held by one attacker while another appears to repeatedly punch him.

Seconds later a man can bee seen sinking his teeth in to the victim's ear as he desperately tries to wriggle free.

The video then shows onlookers and stewards trying to push the attackers away.

A voice 
can be heard behind the camera saying: 'He's an idiot, take him out' in 
reference to the man who carried out the assault.

Amongst the confusion, the cameraman then approaches the victim and asks: 'What happened, what happened?'

Asking
 the victim to display his blood-soaked ear, the cameraman then says: 
'Come here, turn around. That's what he's done to you, man.'

Bizarrely,
 and despite his injuries, the victim manages a smile as he explains 
how his ear was brutally bitten off just seconds earlier.

The Sunday People reports that north London-based fan Billy Grant filmed the incident and quote him as saying: 'Everyone who witnessed what happened to the kid was absolutely disgusted.

'The guy who attacked him was an idiot.

'He attacked another England fan, racially abused him and then bit his ear off. It was appalling.'

Former
 Liverpool striker Stan Collymore tweeted that he had seen footage of 
the fan attack and claimed it would be 'the biggest story in the UK, 
especially who did it'.

Six British police officers travelled to Brazil for the tournament to offer support and advice to local police.

Chief
 Superintendent Rachel Barber said: 'We were made aware during the 
England vs Uruguay match in Sao Paulo that an incident had taken place 
which resulted in an England fan having a portion of his ear bitten off 
by another England fan.

The attack happened in the stands after England had been beaten by Uruguay in the crucial World Cup group stage fixture. Pictured, Luis Suarez, right, consoles England captain Steven Gerrard, left, after the final whistle blows

'In the immediate aftermath, we managed to make contact with the victim and offered advice and support.

'The day after the attack, the victim chose to make a formal complaint to the local police, and they opened an investigation.

'During the course of our pursuit of the assailant, we located and interviewed several witnesses.'

No arrests have been made yet but interviews with witnesses gave police a name for the alleged attacker, Ms Barber said.

Police went to England's final match against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte in case the assailant travelled to the match but did not find him there.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident in Sao Paulo on June 19 involving a British national and we provided consular assistance.'Â
