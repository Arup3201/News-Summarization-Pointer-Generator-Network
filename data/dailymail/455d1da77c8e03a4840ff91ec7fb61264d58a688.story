A former Afghanistan Marine who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder  has found refuge in rowing the length of the Mississippi river.

The trip to the mouth of the river at the Gulf of Mexico took Joshua Ploetz, 69 days, about 50 of them spent paddling.

But Ploetz said he needed every inch of the more than 2,500-mile river to paddle away the demons of the war, or at least calm them a bit. 

Ploetz, 30, from Winona, Minnesota, returned from the war eight years ago after being injured by a roadside bomb, suffering a minor stroke and watching his friends die. 

But adapting to civilian life proved difficult. Relationships failed, employment was hard to come by and, Ploetz said, he had an overwhelming feeling of being 'lost.'

The idea of the river journey was set in motion years ago by a chance encounter in a bar with Matthew Mohlke, author of 'Floating Down the Country,' who told Ploetz about his book describing his solo canoe journey paddling the Mississippi in 1999.

The seed was planted, Ploetz said, for his own 'river experience.'

Ploetz created a Facebook page, called 'Paddle Off The War,' to mark his trip and raise awareness of PTSD.

He made friends along the way, including Aleks Nelson, a kayaker from Duluth, Minnesota, who joined Ploetz about 10 days into the trip and paddled alongside him to the end.

He said he knows his own battle with post-traumatic stress isn't over, and may never be, but the river taught him how to cope.

'You're going to have your troubles on the river, but just keep paddling,' he said.

'You'll make it through it.'

His last morning on the river, he read scripture beneath a rainbow that peeked through puffy white clouds overhead. 

As he paddled his way into the Gulf of Mexico on July 28, he lifted his baton in triumph.

The finish, he said, was bittersweet: 'I want to be done, but I want more river to paddle.'
