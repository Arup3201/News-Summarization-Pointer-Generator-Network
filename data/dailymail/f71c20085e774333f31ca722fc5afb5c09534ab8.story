Austfonna, one of the largest ice caps in the world, is moving much faster than expected.

This is according to the recent satellite images which reveal what scientists describe as ‘extraordinary’ changes in the region.

The ice cap, which had been relatively stable for years, is located on Norway's Svalbard region and covers just over 3,000 square miles (8,000 sq km).

Launch: 3 April 2014 at Kourou, French Guiana

Life: Minimum of seven years

Mass: 2300 kg (5070 lbs)

Instrument: C-band synthetic aperture radar

Dimensions: 9.2ft (2.8m) long, 8.2ft (2.5m) wide, 13ft (4m) high

Mission: Monitoring sea ice, oil spills, winds and waves, land-use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquake

A combination of measurements by Esa’s Sentinel-1A last and Germany’s Terrasar-X satellite recently revealed a dramatic acceleration in ice motion.

The movement is in the south eastern section, which is now flowing at least 10 times faster than previously measured, claim scientists.

Researchers had believed the Arctic's Austfonna Ice Cap was losing substantial amounts of ice through its major glacier at Cap Mohn. These images confirm that theory.

‘We've observed Austfonna with various satellite radar datasets over the past 20 years, and it hasn't done very much,’ Professor Andy Shepherd from Leeds University told the BBC.

‘But we've now looked at it again with the new Sentienl-1a spacecraft, and it's clear it has speeded up quite considerably in the last two or three years.’

Together, the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets contain more than 99 per cent of the freshwater ice on Earth.

Ice sheets are constantly moving, slowly flowing downhill under their own weight. But long as an ice sheet accumulates the same mass of snow as it loses to the sea, it remains stable.

Sentinel-1A's ability to 'see' through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring sea ice

Images from its advanced radar can be used to distinguish clearly between the thinner more navigable first-year ice and the hazardous, much thicker multi-year ice.

A detailed report on Austfonna and the possible causes of the speed-up is now being prepared for publication in a science journal.

'It remains to be seen whether the abrupt speed-up reflects natural variability in the ice cap motion, or whether it is a symptom of regional climate change,' said Esa.
