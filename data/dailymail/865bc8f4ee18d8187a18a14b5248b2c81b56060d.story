President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron declared on Thursday that their nations would 'not be cowed' by extremists from the Islamic State group who have claimed responsibility for beheading two American journalists.

'If terrorists think we will weaken in the face of their threats they could not be more wrong,' Obama and Cameron wrote in a joint op-ed in the Times of London on the eve of a NATO summit in Wales.

Cameron and Obama 
called the murders 'utterly despicable' and said they are the 'latest 
evidence of a brutal and poisonous extremism that murders 
indiscriminately and risks exporting terrorism abroad.'

The op-ed follows a claim by Obama on Wednesday that the U.S. could make ISIS a more 'manageable problem' if it were flanked by an international coalition.

But U.S. lawmakers say they want fewer words and more action from the Commander in Chief. Members of Congress on both sides of political divide are pressuring Obama to act, and they plan to propose legislation next week that would give the president the authority to continue airstrikes on ISIS - possibly beyond Iraq in Syria, too.

NATO 
leaders grappled on Thursday with whether the alliance has a role in 
containing a mounting militant threat in the Middle East, as heads of 
state converged in Wales for a high-stakes summit also focused on the 
crisis in Ukraine and next steps in Afghanistan.

Obama, Cameron and dozens of other NATO leaders met on a golf resort in Wales for the two-day summit.

The U.S. president and British prime minister were expected to pressure their allies to work together to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and present a united front against Russia over its annexation of eastern Ukraine.

'With more than 60 countries represented at the summit, we can build this proud alliance of transatlantic nations into a more effective security network that fosters stability around the world,' the heads of state said on Thursday.

Both the 
U.S. and Britain are deeply concerned about the potential threat to 
their homelands that could come from the foreign fighters who have 
joined the violent Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.

Earlier
 this week Cameron proposed new laws that would give police the power to
 seize the passports of Britons suspected of having traveled abroad to 
fight with terrorist groups.

The
 U.S. began launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq 
last month, and both the U.S. and Britain have been making humanitarian 
aid drops to besieged minority groups there.

Cameron
 said that he hadn't ruled out joining the U.S. in airstrikes, but added
 that the priority was to support those already fighting the militants 
on the ground.

'We
 need to show real resolve and determination, we need to use every power
 and everything in our armory with our allies — with those on the ground
 — to make sure we do everything we can to squeeze this dreadful 
organization out of existence,' Cameron told the British network ITV.

Cameron and Obama also visited a class learning about NATO at Mount Pleasant Primary School on Thursday

Also facing Obama is a decision about whether to expand U.S. military action against the extremists to Syria. While Obama has said he's considering that step, he has suggested in recent days that it's not imminent.

Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson said on Tuesday that he would file a bill next week that that would give Obama the power to carry out airstrikes in Syria.

'Let
 there be no doubt, we must go after ISIS right away because the U.S. is
 the only one that can put together a coalition to stop this group 
that’s intent on barbaric cruelty,' the Florida politician said in a statement.

Republican Representative Frank Wolf plans to introduce legislation of his own that would give Obama broad authority to take military action against all terrorist groups, regardless of their location.

Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973 the president must receive congressional approval if he plans to engage a country militarily for more than 60 days.

If Obama wants to continue airstrikes in Iraq, Congress must give him the green light before October 7.

Obama could begin strikes in Syria without the permission of the legislative body, but U.S. officials say Obama is reluctant to delve into country's quagmire on his own.

Lawmakers have pressed the president to provide a concrete plan for how he plans to confront the crisis in Syria after he confessed last week that 'we don't have a strategy yet' for that.

'I am of support of going in and not sitting back, but creating a strategy of where we go,' House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday in an interview on the Hugh Hewitt Show.

'And if the president won’t act, I think we have to take some action to move forward,' the Republican lawmaker said, according to the Hill.

House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers said on the same show that he would support legislation giving White House officials the authority 'to go after ISIS where they find them.'

'They don’t sense borders,' he said. 'We ought not to sense those borders.

'We shouldn’t handcuff ourselves in an effort to degrade and disable their ability to conduct operations,' Rogers added.

Obama is expected use some of his discussions in Wales to try to build a coalition that could join him in confronting the Islamic State through a combination of military might, diplomatic pressure and economic penalties.

The president 'wants to build an international coalition,' State 
Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Wednesday.

'That's not 
going to be overnight. We need capabilities from many countries.'

Obama administration 
officials maintain that the U.S. will not launch a ground war against 
the Islamic State militants.

Psaki stopped short on Wednesday of ruling out 
airstrikes against the group in its safe haven in Syria, as the U.S. has
 resisted for years, however.

Obama 
has 'been clear that we're not going to be limited by geography,' she said. 

The State Department spokeswoman described a range of actions 
being considered against the Islamic State, and noted that decisions and
 discussions were ongoing.

Over
 the past day, Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration 
officials have reached out to leaders from Australia, the United Arab Emrites, Jordan, 
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Italy and Israel to discuss how to combat the 
Islamic State.

Psaki said the discussions focused on what each country 
might contribute — including weapons, humanitarian aid and other 
resources — and noted that some nations already have.

'Countries that don’t have a lot in common and countries that don’t always cooperate with us are starting to stand up,' White House Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said on Thursday, adding that those countries were 'starting to see' that ISIS is the 'wolf at their door.'

Blinken confirmed to MSNBC that Saudi Arabia may joining forces with the U.S.

Obama and Cameron visited a local school Thursday morning, where they greeted students learning about NATO before sitting down for a private meeting.

Later, the two met with their counterparts from France, Germany and Italy to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. In a show of Western solidarity, new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also joined the discussion.

Ukraine and Russia have been locked in a standoff for months, with pro-Moscow forces stirring instability in eastern Ukrainian cities.

On Wednesday NATO Russia and Ukraine said they were working on a deal to halt the fighting, but Western leaders expressed skepticism — noting it wasn't the first attempt to end the deadly conflict.

A centerpiece of the NATO summit was to be the announcement of the rapid response force. Officials said the alliance could position at least 4,000 forces and military equipment in the Baltics and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.

'Russia has ripped up the rulebook with its illegal, self-declared annexation of Crimea and its troops on Ukrainian soil threatening a sovereign nation state,' Obama and Cameron wrote.

'We must use our military to ensure a persistent presence in Eastern Europe, making clear to Russia that we will always uphold our Article 5 commitments to collective self-defense,' they said.

Under Article 5 of the NATO charter, an attack on one member state is viewed on an attack on the whole alliance.

Obama and Cameron said on Thursday that members of NATO 'who want to adopt an isolationist approach misunderstand the nature of security in the 21st century.

'Developments in other parts of the world, particularly in Iraq and Syria, threaten our security at home,' they stated.

Arriving
 at the summit site on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh 
Rasmussen said he believes the broader international community 'has an 
obligation to stop the Islamic State from advancing further,' but noted 
that the alliance hasn't received any request for help.

'I'm
 sure that if the Iraqi government were to forward a request for NATO 
assistance, that would be considered seriously by NATO allies,' 
Rasmussen said.
