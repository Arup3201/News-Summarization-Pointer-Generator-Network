West Ham manager Sam Allardyce admits he has been surprised how quickly striker Diafra Sakho has found his feet in England.

Sakho, a summer signing from French side Metz, now has five goals in as many games after finding the target in the 2-0 defeat of QPR.

Nedum Onuoha's own goal had given West Ham the lead at Upton Park, setting them on the way to a win which means they head into the international break in good shape.

Allardyce said: 'I would have seen Sakho as being a player, coming from the French second division, playing maybe 10 to 15 games for us and finding out about the Premier League.

'But he is so desperate to do well and his runs are so good at the opposition's defences and he seems to have the knack - and that's the hardest knack of all - of turning up in the right place at the right time.

'So that's fantastic for him and absolutely outstanding business for us at West Ham.'

In contrast, Harry Redknapp has little to smile about with his QPR team bottom of the Barclays Premier League.

The west London side made a number of high-profile signings in the summer but the team's big names have failed to deliver results so far this season.

Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville described the visitors' attitude as 'diabolical' after the game but Redknapp refused to criticise his players' commitment.

The 67-year-old said: 'We need to get them fitter. I've put a lot of faith into Sandro. Unfortunately he's had an injury and we need to get him fit.

'When he's fit he's a fantastic player - I had him at Tottenham, he's an excellent player - but at the moment he's short of fitness.

'The doctor came to me at half-time and told me he can only play another 15 minutes - I need players who can play 90 minutes.

'They've had injuries and missed training - we need to get everyone fit and ready to go.'

Redknapp's side face a tough run of fixtures after the international break with Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City to come in the next four games.

When asked if the players were letting him down with their disappointing displays, Redknapp said: 'I don't think so. We're short - we're short of goals, we're short up front.

'It's been difficult, we lost Loic Remy on the deadline and couldn't get a replacement. We've had a tough start but there's an awful long way to go.

'We're not going to give up are we? It's early days. We have to find a way of playing that suits everybody and get the best out of what we've got.'
