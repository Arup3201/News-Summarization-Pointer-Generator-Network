A middle-aged woman went on a drunken rampage after downing six Budweisers and stripping to her underwear, police said today.

Marianne Porcaro, 51, knocked on a string of doors at the Holiday Inn, in Port St Lucie, South Florida, in the early hours of the morning.

Police found her in the hotel's swimming pool. When challenged, she claimed she was pregnant and that the baby had prompted her behaviour.

Porcaro now faces a disorderly intoxication charge after she was arrested on November 15, according to the report seen by NBC Miami.

Police officers were called to the 
hotel at 12.30am and were told that the she had been running around in 
her bra and panties and knocking on doors of other guests, the report said.

The fire alarm had also been pulled and the manager told the officer he believed Porcaro was behind that too.

Porcaro was found in the pool after apparently jumping over the fence because it was closed.

The officer told her to get out of the pool and asked what was behind the bizarre series of events.

The report stated: 'When asked why she was running around the hotel in her bra and panties and knocking on the other guest doors waking them up, she said she was pregnant.'

Porcaro said she 'had drank approximately a six pack of Budweiser and that was why she was acting the way she was', according to the the report.

It added that Porcaro appeared intoxicated, was having a difficulty walking and was slurring when she spoke.

A guest told the officer he had seen Porcaro pull the fire alarm, which caused several hotel guests to evacuate their rooms.

Porcaro was arrested for disorderly intoxication and had to be medically cleared before she was booked into jail because she had said she was pregnant, the report said.

She was later released on $375 bond, records showed. She could still face additional charges for the allegation that she pulled the fire alarm.
