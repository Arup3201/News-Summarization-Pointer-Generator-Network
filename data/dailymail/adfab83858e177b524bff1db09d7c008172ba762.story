Swansea face a major striker crisis after Bafetimbi Gomis cast uncertainty over his future and indicated that promises of playing time have been broken.

The 29-year-old is unhappy about the lack of starts he was given following his arrival on a Bosman transfer from Lyon in the summer.

That situation has changed in the wake of Wilfried Bony’s £25m move to Manchester City, but the striker has surprised and angered Swansea staff by speaking out on Sunday about his frustrations.

The comments come just days after Gomis’s agent claimed Arsenal, Newcastle and Crystal Palace are interested in the France international. Garry Monk has previously insisted he has no doubts about Gomis’s commitment to the club, though the striker appears increasingly receptive to the idea of a quick move on from the Liberty Stadium.

Gomis is quoted in France as saying: 'I have been approached by clubs. When Bony was here, it was also planned that I should play a certain number of games... that wasn't the case.

‘Today, I ask myself many questions. I need time to think. It's very difficult to accept to spend my time on the bench.

‘I don’t know what will happen. Me leaving? It is possible.’

Monk now faces a huge dilemma, with his only other senior striking option being Nelson Oliveira, who is currently on loan from Benfica.

The Swansea manager went to significant lengths last week in talking down previous comments from Gomis that indicated he was unsettled.

But the issue has resurfaced with curious timing, considering Bony’s departure and the fact he has started Swansea’s past four games.

Gomis only started two Premier League games in the first six weeks of the season following his move from France.
