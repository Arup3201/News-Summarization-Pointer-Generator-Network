Tragedy: Lauren Walker, 13, died last October of a fatal gastric haemorrhage, which may have been preventable

A 13-year-old schoolgirl who died in her sleep could have been saved if she had undergone a routine brain scan, an inquest has heard.

Lauren Walker, of Richmond, Sheffield, was rushed to hospital with severe headache and slurred speech, but her condition was treated as a migraine.

Just weeks after the teenager had visited A&E at Sheffield Children’s Hospital, her parents found her dead in her bed last October.

An inquest into her death heard that Lauren, a pupil at Sheffield’s City School, actually had hydrocephalus - a build-up of fluid on the brain - after being born with an undiagnosed defect which meant it was unable to drain away.

A condition which could have been picked up with a CT or MRI scan and treated with surgery, pathologist Luiz Peres, who carried out a post-mortem examination, said.

A Sheffield inquest heard that Lauren suffered a fatal gastric haemorrhage, possibly caused by a combination of painkillers to relieve her headaches and her brain condition, which caused some ulceration of her stomach lining.

‘We are all devastated by Lauren’s death, and would like to know if Lauren would still be here today if she’d had a brain scan. It makes it more difficult to deal with,’ Lauren’s father, Mark Walker, said in a statement.

Lauren had complained about a headache on the night of her death, and her mother, Theresa Flint, had remained at her side until she fell asleep.

Ms Flint told the inquest that when she checked on her daughter the following morning, she found her unresponsive.

Mr Walker made several attempts to revive his daughter but it was too late.

Three weeks earlier, Lauren complained of a headache and slurred speech, and an ambulance was called.

Mr Walker told the inquest that he had spoken to Lauren’s mother, saying their daughter ‘needed a scan’.

Avoidable: Lauren Walker's condition could have been picked up with a CT or MRI scan, but despite several medical professionals discussing the idea at Sheffield Children's Hospital, none was carried out

In addition, a trainee doctor and a consultant at Sheffield Children’s Hospital’s A&E that admitted the teenager both told the inquest they agreed a scan could have helped with diagnosis.

Dr Katharine Nunn and Mr Chris Fitzsimmons, who worked in A&E on September 25, said they decided to admit her and referred her to the inpatient paediatric team.

Both Dr Nunn and Mr Fitzsimmons said although they discussed the possibility of a scan, neither told the paediatric team of their thoughts.

Mr Fitzsimmons, a consultant in paediatric emergency medicine, said: ‘My expectation was they probably would scan Lauren, but it was not my place to tell them to.’

He said he felt ‘comfortable they were doing the right thing’ referring the case on.

Dr Nunn said she had considered a number of possible reasons for Lauren’s illness, including migraines, a brain tumour and trauma.

Following a second episode of illness the inquest heard Lauren went to see her GP, Dr Ngozi Anumba, at Woodhouse Health Centre, on October 8.

Dr Anumba said she was told by Lauren and her mum that the teen had been diagnosed with migraine, so prescribed migraine prevention medication.

‘My impression was it was a firm diagnosis,’ said the doctor. ‘Her mum told me Lauren had had all the tests, and they told me it was migraine.

‘I thought Lauren had had a scan - I didn’t know she had not had one. I didn’t get the impression there was any uncertainty about the diagnosis.’

Lauren’s mum, who sobbed as she described her daughter, said she was a member of a dance school and an athletics club, and ‘perfect’.

She said: ‘She was doing well at school, she was athletic, she did lots of sports. She was a very kind, giving girl. She was just so kind, she had lots of friends.’

The inquest continues.
