One 72-year old is the oldest graduate of his college in Colorado and proved that it's never too late to follow your dream.

Van McKellar dropped out of high school in the tenth grade in 1956 and never thought he'd be able to attend university.

The Huffington Post reports that McKellar began home schooling with his daughter years later and once he brushed up his math skills he was accepted to Metropoliton State College of Denver. He said he was always good at science and English but still needed to catch up for lost schooling before attending college.

Before McKellar was a college student he was a mechanic who was able to make enough money to support his family. However, he told Huffington Post he felt like 'something was missing' and that he always wanted to have the college learning experience.

McKellar graduated Cum Laude in 2012 with a major in African American studies and a minor in history.

Mckellar spoke with HuffPost Live and told them what it's like to go to school with a bunch of 20-somethings.

'During the five years that I was in college, I began to feel like I was one of them,' McKellar said. 'Of course, my arthritis and other things that come to you when you're 70 let me know that I was not. But I felt like a college student.'

McKellar told Huffington Post that he enjoys college staples like facebook because it helps him to stay in touch with his friends and family.

He also said he has a message for his family which is, 'Hey if Dad can go to college then I can go to college.' He encourages young people to achieve their dreams despite obstacles they may face.

Coincidentally there is an American film about another Van called Van Wilder about a college student who takes seven years to graduate. Unlike Van Wilder however, Van McKellar graduated with honors and didn't goof his way through school.
