Crystal Palace left back Zeki Fryers has agreed to join Rotherham on a one month loan deal after failing to hold down a first team spot at Selhurst Park.

Fryers, who joined the south London outfit from Tottenham in the summer, has made just two appearances so far this season.

Championship outfit Rotherham have moved quickly to conclude a deal for Fryers as full back Reece James has been recalled by Manchester United.

Alan Pardew is keen on signing a new left back during the January transfer window as Martin Kelly and Joel Ward have both been forced into playing out of position during the course of the season.

Eagles boss Pardew launched a £3.5million bid for Swansea defender Neil Taylor on Thursday evening, however the Welsh side have rejected Palace's offer.

Fryers' imminent loan exit suggests Pardew remains confident of luring a natural left-sided defender to the club before February 2.
