He has suffered from chronic foot pain since birth, but now 13-year-old Kaleo Niko will move with ease after making the brave choice to have both legs amputated.

The Colorado teenager was born with Arthrogryposis, a rare muscular disorder that made running and walking unbearable.

When the pain grew worse after four surgeries, the eighth-grader consulted doctors and even amputee Olympic climber Craig Demartino before deciding to remove his legs below the knee and get prosthetics. 

Brave: Kaleo Niko, 13, chose to have his legs amputated rather than continue to deal with the chronic pain caused by his rare muscle disease, Arthrogryposis

Heartbreaking: Kaleo Niko, 13, said he was initially really scared at first, but feels good after the operation

Kaleo
had the amputation surgery on September 3 at Shriners Hospital for Children in
Salt Lake City, Utah.

The 
hospital will cover the cost of the surgery and first set of 
prosthetics, which will be fitted on October 21 - just days before 
Kaleo's 14th birthday.

'Every time I walked, it hurt my ankles and feet. If I
walked a lot, I'd get stabbing pains in my legs,' the Walt Clark Middle School student told Reporter-Herald.

'When the doctor first brought up amputation, I didn't want to even hear about it.'

'I was really scared at first. And when I woke up I was good,' he told RTV6.

Supportive: Kaleo Niko is surrounded by family Shriner¿s Hospital for Children, which is covering the cost of the surgery and the first set of prosthetics

Phantom limbs: Kaleo Niko had both legs amputated below the knee and said he feels like he can still 'wriggle his toes' even though he no longer has them

Devoted: Kaleo Niko's mother, Helen Niko, said doctors detected her son's disease before he was born and gave her the option to have an abortion

Influential: Kaleo reportedly consulted amputee Olympic climber Craig DeMartino on whether he should proceed with amputation

Kaleo said he was at peace with the difficult decision because it meant he would finally be able to keep up with friends.

Even though he enjoyed swimming, 
golfing, basketball, and bowling, Kaleo said he couldn’t do any of them 
for more than a few minutes at a time.

'I couldn’t keep up with my friends. Sometimes, I just had to sit out and watch them,' he said.

Kaleo's supportive mother Helen Niko said doctors had diagnosed her son's condition while she was pregnant and gave her the option to have an abortion.

'I just can’t imagine not 
having him here,' she said. 'There were a lot of tests thrown at us and 
whatnot. They wanted us to be fully aware of what we were getting into, 
in case we wanted to abort. We just refused.'

She said she was worried about 
amputation, but  also knew this sort of pain was something a
mother’s hug could not fix.

'As a parent you want to be able to take that pain, but there are some that you can’t,' she told ksn.com.

'I remember one night, he looked at me, 
crying, and he said ‘I’m done'.

'It was just time. He was ready. He wanted to see what life was like with two working feet.'

Kaleo underwent his first surgery at 
13 months for bilateral clubfoot correction, which he had every four 
years again at ages four, eight and 12.

Over time, his heel would lift, causing him to walk on his toes and requiring another surgery.

Now, with both legs removed and new prosthetics, Kaleo will be able to get back to being a kid without the chronic pain.

'It feels really weird because I can wiggle my toes, but I don’t have any toes,' he said.
