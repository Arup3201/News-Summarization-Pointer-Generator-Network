The former Ku Klux Klan leader who is charged with killing three people at Jewish community sites in Kansas City has previously been arrested for soliciting a male prostitute who was black.

The new revelation about Frazier Glenn Cross' past shows how the anti-Semitic gunman had a criminal history that runs against the hate-filled speech that he has spewed for decades.

ABC reports that Frazier Glenn Cross was originally named Frazier Glenn Miller, rising through the ranks of the anti-Semitic and racist groups, founding the Carolina Knights of the KKK and the paramilitary White Patriot Party.

Facing his actions: Frazier Glenn Cross, who is accused of killing three in an anti-Semitic shooting spree, was in and Olathe, Kansas courtroom on Thursday for a scheduling session

Past connections: Cross, pictured today, was given a new identity in 1990 but new reports have unveiled a history of having sex with male prostitutes and ratting on his friends in exchange for leniency

His name changed after he struck a deal with authorities by becoming a paid informant and got a lessened jail sentence for a separate slew of charges.

Investigators only later realized that Miller had an earlier arrest involving a male prostitute.

'It was pretty shocking, because of his personal stances that he had taken and what he was now accused (of) engaging in,' J. Douglas McCullough told ABC.

Mr McCullough is now a judge on the North Carolina state court of appeals but in 1987 when investigators were looking into Miller, he was a federal prosecutor.

No public record of the 1986 arrest could be found by ABC but the situation was confirmed by Miller-who now goes by Cross- during a recorded call with the Southern Poverty Law Center- though he explained the arrest as his own effort to catch the prostitute gone-wrong.

History of violence: Cross originally went by the name Frazier Glenn Miller (pictured in 1985) and created two racist and anti-Semitic groups and was once caught with a black prostitute who was a man masquerading as a woman

Miller said that he purposefully 'lured' the male prostitute who was dressed as a woman to the spot where they were caught because he planned on attacking the prostitute. The situation did not fit that description when police arrived, however.

Mr McCullough said that the details of
 the arrest are 'rather salacious. I think the facts speak for 
themselves and people can draw their own conclusions about how 
incongruous that is.'

The 
prostitution case was folded into the host of other charges lined up 
against Miller who became the subject of a nation-wide manhunt after he 
started sending out racist and anarchist literature, calling for an 
uprising.

Arrests: Miller was first arrested in 1987 and was in jail until 1990 before being arrested again this month (pictured) following the shootings

'I realize fully that I will be caught quickly... but I will die with contempt on my lips and with sword in my hand. My fate will either be assassination or the death penalty,' he wrote in the letter, which he titled 'Declaration of War'.

Miller fled from North Carolina and was caught by the Marshalls and the FBI in a early morning raid on a cabin in Ozark, Missouri on April 20, 1987.

The sentiment behind the written bravado quickly dissepated after he was put behind bars and faced the prospect of more than 20 years in prison for his accumulation of charges.

'He stated that it was "all a bluff that got out of hand,”' and FBI agent wrote in the case file obtained by ABC News.

'Having spent eight days in jail and having the opportunity to dry out from excessive alcohol consumption, he has learned to develop tolerance. He stated emphatically that he would never hurt anybody.'

Taking that claim and his value as an informant who could move easily within the KKK community and report on his friends' activity, Miller was released from jail in 1990 and given a new name and social security number.

'I joined the family in Sioux City, Iowa... I enrolled in truck driving school…and I’ve been trucking ever since. And I love it. After prison, the freedom of the open road is gloriously exhilarating,' he wrote in a self-published autobiography.

Being held: Frazier Glenn Cross (pictured on April 15) was arrested for the shooting deaths of three people in Kansas City but it has since been revealed that he was given that name after becoming an FBI informant and had a criminal past

Hate crime: The 73-year-old who goes by his new name of Frazier Glenn Miller now faces three first-degree murder charges and is expected to have hate crimes added to it

So far, the 73-year-old has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder but hate crimes charges are expected to come soon.

Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at an interfaith service following the shooting and indicated that the prosecution will be taking the case very seriously.

'Every alleged hate crime, no matter who the intended target, is an affront to who we are... both as a country and as people. These acts cannot be ignored,' Holder said at the April 17 service.
