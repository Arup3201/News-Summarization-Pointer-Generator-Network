A female passenger smuggled a dog onto a London-bound British Airways flight.

She managed to get the tiny Yorkshire Terrier past security at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport in Israel.

The Airbus A321 had taxied as far as the runway last night when a passenger alerted cabin and crew that there was a dog on board and the plane turned back to the stand.

The passenger had heard a squeaking noise from under a seat.

BA staff question the woman, believed to be American, then after some discussion removed her, the dog and her luggage from the plane.

One passenger said: 'People are concerned about the security implications. How on earth did she manage to get a dog through security at Ben Gurion?'

The dog owner was occupying a window seat. The passenger next but one to her raised the alarm.

The BA flight 166 from Tel Aviv to Heathrow had already been delayed from its original take-off time of 7.00pm (local Israeli time) but was on time for its re-scheduled slot at 8.40pm.

Cabin crew had already given passengers their safety briefing when the dog was discovered.

The captain announced that the woman had been removed after a dog was found in her bag.

Dogs are relatively common sight at the airport and are allowed to travel on some other airlines, but not in the main cabin of BA flights.

'A British Airways spokesman said the passenger would have passed through all the relevant security and immigration points at Tel Aviv.

She said: 'We did not allow a female customer to travel on board our service from Tel Aviv to Heathrow today after it was discovered, shortly after boarding, that she was carrying a small dog in her handbag.

We apologise to our customers who experienced a delay to the departure of their flight as a result of this incident.'
