The RSVP has been sent, the hotel booked and transport arranged, so the only thing left is — whisper it — the outfit.

With July upon us, the month that sees more weddings than any other, chances are there’s still some what-do-I-wear panic among the less organised of us — especially as ceremonies are getting ever more elaborate, and held in increasingly unusual locations. Here, Femail fashion editor Eliza Scarborough shows you how to dress, whatever the occasion.

Dress for the elements at a beach wedding — sun, sea and sand don’t suit super-high heels and feathered fascinators. So, pair kitten heels with a floppy hat. A short jacket will protect you from gusty conditions and these jolly stripes give a nice nod to nautical.

A chic dress with sparkly accessories 
gives understated glamour. The embellised Alice band is a relaxed 
alternative to a hat or fascinator.

Here's quintessential British style — a classic hat and dress.

As the least formal type of wedding, you can get away with a strappy dress and bare shoulders. You don’t have to have a hat, but it could be useful to shield you from the sun.

Try something modern for a service in 
the city, like this tailored jumpsuit. You’ll need to look smart, so 
wear a statement hat and a jacket.

Say goodbye to stiletto heels for this 
relaxed affair: a pair of metallic flats add just the right amount of 
glamour to a pretty mesh dress.

EVENING EVENT

A black tie evening wedding is usually dressy. This calls for a sleek silhouette and glittering accessories. Don’t choose a hemline that stops above the knee,  because this is the occasion for a floor-skimming gown. Hats or fascinators should be avoided — a statement necklace or glittery hair slide works better instead.
