Aston Massey, 23, finally has the figure she has dreamed of for 20 years with her fourth boob job - after her first fake breast exploded

A woman disfigured by childhood burns finally has the figure she has dreamed of for 20 years with her fourth boob job - after her first fake breast exploded.

Aston Massey, 23, from Carshalton, Surrey, was badly scarred when she poured boiling water over herself at the age of three and a build-up of scar tissue meant she was left with lopsided breasts.

She had a mastectomy at the age of 21 in June 2012 and her first right breast implant was successfully fitted in October 2012.

But when she had further surgery to fit a new nipple five months later she contracted a blood infection and the implant travelled up her chest and pressed on her collar bone before bursting one night as she slept. 

More than a pint of pus leaked from a gaping hole in her boob and Ms Massey had to be rushed to hospital.

'My whole boob was like one giant spot just waiting to be popped and part of me wanted it to,' said Ms Massey.

'There was so much pressure I thought it might burst at any moment. My breast had swollen so much that even a sneeze could have caused it to explode.

'I remember shouting to my sister: 'My boob's exploded!' It sounds quite funny now, but at the time I was really panicking.'

The support worker for disabled people rejected two further NHS implants in August 2013 and February 2014, but she finally underwent a successful operation in September this year.

After years of struggling to fit an A-cup bra Ms Massey is now a C-size and plans to have a nipple tattooed on her new boob to complete the transformation.

'I never imagined I'd have to go through so much, but I don't regret a minute of it,' she said.

'I've been dreaming about having a normal pair of boobs for as long as I can remember, and no matter how much surgery I have to go through, I'll do it to achieve my dream.'

She was scarred for life after climbing over a baby gate at home and pulling a pot of boiling potatoes on top of her. 

After her first breast implant surgery 18 years later her boob exploded when she caught an infection brought on by capsular contracture.

This is a common complication in breast augmentation surgery where the body forms a hard capsule of scar tissue around the implant and it has to be removed. 

In August 2013 she had reconstructive surgery for a second time but a few weeks after the implant was put back in she caught another infection.

She had a mastectomy as soon as she turned 21 (right) and her first right breast implant in June 2012 to correct the imbalance, but her new breast swelled to four times its normal size and burst (right)

Just six months later she had another implant fitted but was left devastated when it was again rejected by her body.

She had her final operation in September this year to fit a new implant as scar tissue caused by the blood infection had caused it to be pushed up her chest.

'I'm absolutely delighted that I have got over all of these issues,' she said.

'Because it went so well at first I didn't really think that anything bad might happen, especially because I was so young.

'I am just happy that I have finally got over that hill and can start to look forward.' 

Infection and bleeding are relatively rare after breast implant surgery. 

But if you are having an implant fitted for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy (breast removal), you may have a greater risk of infection and bleeding.

Most infections can be treated using antibiotics. But if your breast becomes severely infected, you may need to have the implant removed to prevent further complications developing. 

You should be able to have the implant reinserted after the infection has cleared up. 

Some research suggests the risk of infection and bleeding may be increased if you smoke because your wounds will take longer to heal. 

Surgeons may recommend not smoking before your operation to reduce the risk of developing complications.

Some of the problems that can occur as a result of having breast implants fitted include:

 

Within four weeks of her first operation operation she contracted a blood infection and the implant travelled up her chest and pressed on her collar bone before bursting one night as she slept
