Residents of several upper Midwest states are expected to awaken to a new layer of snow, while northern New England could find a world frozen over in more than a half-inch of ice brought by a sloppy storm that already has claimed at least two lives.

A storm system that dished a bit of everything Saturday on an area of about 2,000 miles stretching from Texas to eastern Canada was expected to bring rain Sunday to areas back East that enjoyed spring-like temperatures the day before.

Travelers likely avoided the worst if they left or arrived in the Midwest by midday Saturday. But by afternoon, roads in many areas became slick and flight cancellations and delays started mounting.

By midnight eastern time Saturday, nearly 500 flights into or out of U.S. airports had been cancelled and some 7,000 had been delayed, aviation tracking website FlightAware.com reported.

A line of thunderstorms stretching from southern Louisiana to Indiana began wreaking havoc, causing rivers and creeks to swell, flooding roads and spawning winds strong enough to force cars and trucks off of highways.

At least two suspected tornadoes touched down in Arkansas, injuring a total of five people and damaging nearly two-dozen homes in or near the towns of Dermott and Hughes.

And the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) reported at least two deaths, one of them in Coahoma County, in the northwestern part of the state, and Jasper County in the central part of the state.

The Coahoma County coroner identified the victim as James Sanders, 43, who was killed when gusty winds blew over his mobile home, pinning him against a tree, MS News Now reported.

‘This is a particularly strong storm with very warm, near record-breaking temperatures in the East and very cold air in the Midwest, and that contrast is the sort of conditions that are favorable for not only winter weather but also tornadoes,’ said National Weather Service meteorologist Ed Danaher in College Park, Maryland.

The worst of Winter Storm Gemini wasn't supposed to hit Chicago until late Saturday or early Sunday, giving those traveling to, from or through the Windy City a window at the start of the holiday rush.

As of midnight, most of the air travel disruptions were affecting flights in and out of airports that serve as major hubs, including Chicago's O'Hare, Houston's Bush International, Dallas/Fort Worth and Denver International.

Given the potential problems with flying and driving, some travelers opted for rail.

Darren Hall, 45, of Raymore, Mo., normally drives to St. Louis for the holiday, but decided not to risk it because of the freezing rain hitting the area and the promise of worse to come. Instead, he was waiting for a train at Kansas City's Union Station.

‘You don't have to deal with all the roads. It's safer, less hassle,’ Hall said.

Freezing rain coated parts of northern New England Saturday night, as officials warned people to stay off the roads and utilities prepared for the possibility of widespread power outages.

Burlington, Vermont, had received a quarter-inch of ice by late Saturday, and the city's airport was forced to rely briefly on generators after losing power briefly.

‘We've lined up hundreds of additional out-of-state line workers and tree trimmers in addition to all the GMP employees who will be working until all power is restored,’ Vermont Green Mountain Power spokeswoman Dorothy Schnure said.

Many Midwest cities that spent Saturday dealing with rain and ice were expected to get significant snowfall overnight, with up to 6 inches forecast for the Kansas City area and up to 8 inches for southern Wisconsin, eastern Iowa and northwest Illinois.

Forecasters said roads that are passable one minute could become treacherous the next as a cold blast on the back end of the storm turns rain to ice and snow.

Whiteout? Freezing rain on Friday morning snarled traffic and forced some school closures in Michigan and Wisconsin. The states were bracing for significant snow, sleet and ice

Making it harder for forecasters to 
stay a step ahead, the system, dubbed 'Gemini,' was a weird swirl of wintry and 
spring-like weather as it passed over areas in the Midwest with freezing
 temperatures and places like Nashville, where it could surpass 70 
degrees.

Temperatures in New York City are also expected to approach the 70-degree mark Sunday, but by tomorrow night, the storm systems 
will be hammering the East Coast. 

CNN reported that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a winter ice emergency and activated
 the state's emergency operations center. The National Weather Service 
in Buffalo issued a winter storm watch for five counties in upstate New 
York and winter storm warnings for two others.

It's bad timing for the estimated 94.5million Americans planning to travel by road or air during this holiday season, which runs from Saturday through January 1, and those hitting the roads for some last-minute shopping.

The storm had several bands of strikingly different weather.

In the Upper Midwest, forecasters expected 6-8 inches of snow north and west of Chicago and into Wisconsin.

It
 was already bringing significant ice accumulations to Oklahoma, 
southern Missouri and northern Arkansas, splitting trees and snapping 
power lines. That was expected to change over to snow by Saturday night.

Parts
 of Maine could get more than a half-inch coating of ice, which would 
make roads treacherous and cause widespread power outages.

‘The
 best advice for everyone is just to really pay attention. With every 
few hours, we're going to get better information,’ Maine Emergency 
Management Agency spokeswoman Lynnette Miller said Friday.

With
 falling temperatures, some of that could be freezing rain by Saturday 
night in the St. Louis area, weather service meteorologist Jon Carney 
said.

In Indiana, the 
National Weather Service posted flood warnings along southern and 
central Indiana streams and predicted the highest flood crests along the
 East Fork of the White River since April 2011.

While
 the Midwest and Plains were preparing for ice and snow, residents down 
South were concerned about tornadoes, which forecasters said were 
possible this weekend even though they are uncommon this time of year - 
but not unheard of.

A tornado outbreak on Christmas Day 2012 reached from northeastern Texas through central Alabama - one twister hit Mobile, Ala.

A tornado on December 16, 2000, killed 11 people in Tuscaloosa, Ala.

The area most threatened stretched from central and northeastern Texas through Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and southeast Missouri, where 80 mph wind gusts and flash flooding were possible.

Rain and ice in Oklahoma were blamed for two fatal traffic accidents and thousands of power outages. A 16-year-old boy died early Saturday after his car crashed and overturned on U.S. 64 near Tulsa, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.

And Oklahoma City police said a woman was killed Friday night in a collision on a slick roadway.

Forecasters said up to a half-inch of ice could accumulate across the middle of the state.

A woman sleeping in a hotel in Holland in western Michigan was injured when a motorist lost control of his car on an icy street early Friday and slammed into the wall outside her room, MLive.com reported.

The weather wasn't the only headache maker. A baggage-equipment breakdown lasted for hours at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, creating a backed-up line of travelers that stretched onto the sidewalk outside one of the terminals.

If there is a silver lining, it's that Christmas happens mid-week this year, AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter said.

‘When a holiday falls on a Wednesday it gives travelers more flexibility of either leaving the weekend before, or traveling right before the holiday and extending the trip through the following weekend,’ Hunter said.
