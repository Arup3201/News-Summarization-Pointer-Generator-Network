She is famous for piling slabs of butter and glugs of cream into any - and every - recipe possible.

But now Paula Deen has revealed that such a rich diet does not come without consequence - as she has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.

The chef, 64, was diagnosed with the condition three years ago, but kept it quiet as she did not want to 'let diabetes stand in the way of enjoying my life', she told the Today Show.

Queen of Southern cuisine: Chef Paula Deen, whose signature dishes 
include a bacon-doughnut-egg burger, has revealed she has Type 2 
diabetes

The condition, linked to obesity, is a result of genetic factors and lifestyle choices. It is a result of the body not producing enough insulin or failing to use it efficiently, allowing excess sugar to build up in the blood.

It can be managed by making lifestyle changes, such as exercising more and lowering blood sugars by altering the diet.

It might come as little surprise that the condition has affected a chef whose signature dishes include bacon, egg and a burger between a doughnut.

And in an interview with the Today Show last year, the mother-of-two revealed she could never live without butter or her deep-fat fryer.

But speaking about her diagnosis, the 'Queen of Southern cuisine' said people should take her recipes with a pinch of salt.

'I've always encouraged moderation,' 
she said. 'People see me cooking all these wonderful, Southern, 
fattening recipes... it's for entertainment. People have to be 
responsible.'

Love of food: Deen has said the one food she could not live without is butter

Speaking with Al Roker, Deen revealed how she told Oprah Winfrey to exercise the same sort of responsibility.

'Like I told Oprah, "Honey, I'm your cook, not your doctor,"' she said. 'You have to be responsible.'

Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too much glucose, a type of sugar, in the blood. It is often associated with obesity.

In those with the condition, the body is unable to break down glucose into energy as there is either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or because the insulin that is there does not work properly.

The symptoms, such as tiredness and weight loss, can be controlled by eating a healthy diet and monitoring the blood glucose level.

Insulin medication, usually in the form of tablets, also controls the condition.

Around 25 million in the United States have diabetes, with around 90 per cent having Type 2.

When asked if her high-fat recipes can lead to diabetes, she said: 'That is part of the puzzle.'

She added that there are other factors, including genetics, lifestyle, stress and age.

To deal with the condition, she is 'making lifestyle adjustments, including lightened-up versions of her favorite recipes'.

The Food Network chef is also taking Victoza, a once-daily, non-insulin injection.

'I am here today to let the world know that it is not a death sentence,' she added.

Although it was rumoured Deen had the condition in April 2010, this is the first time she has confirmed it.

In 2010, Deen earned just under $10 million from her television shows, recipe books, endorsements, retail sales and speaking fees, based on figures by New York Magazine. It suggests she could have earned around $30 million in the time since she was diagnosed.

Type 2 diabetes is an ever-growing problem in the U.S., with around 20 million people suffering from the condition.

Some of Deen's peers have questioned her judgement in keeping her own diagnosis quiet.

Signature dish: One of Deen's recipes is a Lady's Brunch Burger that features doughnuts in place of buns, bacon, a beef burger and a fried egg

Fellow chef Anthony Bourdain told Eater.com: 'When your signature dish is hamburger 
in between a doughnut, and you've been cheerfully selling this stuff 
knowing all along that you've got type 2 diabetes, it's bad 
taste if nothing else.'

According to the People magazine, Paula is said to be under doctor's orders to steer clear of high-calorie foods.

Leading endocrinologist Dr Daniel Lorber
said: 'Diabetes can be deadly because it increases your risk of heart 
disease, kidney failure and stroke.

'And Type 2 diabetes can be directly related to obesity, which is reaching epidemic proportions in this country.'

A family friend told the Enquirer: 'When Paula was diagnosed with diabetes I think she was worried that if her secret got out, it would make her look like a hypocrite.

'Ironically, the very thing that made her rich and famous turned her into a poster child for what could happen if you follow in her footsteps.'
