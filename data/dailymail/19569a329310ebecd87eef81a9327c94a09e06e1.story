A series of photos from Mark Zuckerberg’s private Facebook page were made public today after a web expert managed to gain access thanks to a glitch in the social networking site.

The bug in the website’s photo reporting tool - which Facebook says was only temporary and has now been fixed - meant that users could access others’ pictures even if they were private.

Users were able to look at the private photos by ‘reporting’ a profile picture as ‘inappropriate’, which then saw other photos displayed, such as those of Facebook CEO Mr Zuckerberg.

A Facebook spokesman told CNET the 
glitch happened because of ‘one of our most recent code pushes’ but it 
was only live for a short time and ‘not all content was accessible’.

The reporting system was disabled and 
will be brought back to normal once the bug has been fixed by the 
website’s developers, the spokesman added, restating the site’s 
commitment to data privacy.

The glitch and resulting private 
photos of Mr Zuckerberg went viral when software engineer Mike Rundle, 
of Raleigh, North Carolina, posted a link to them on photo-sharing 
website Imgur.

But Mr Rundle said he first saw the photos linked from a discussion on the online forum Hacker News.

Trick of treat: He kneels with his girlfriend who holds a bowl of Snickers and other chocolate bars on Halloween

Members of a body-building forum first
 picked up on an alleged security flaw which allows users to access 
personal photos when they try to report ‘inappropriate’ profile 
pictures, reported CNET.

Mr Zuckerberg’s long-time girlfriend 
Priscilla Chan is pictured in most of the photos. Some of them can be 
viewed publically on his public Facebook profile, but others are said to
 be private.

The 27-year-old, of Palo Alto, 
California, has a staggering fortune of $17.5billion and treated himself
 to a $7million five-bedroom, five bathroom home earlier this year in 
May.

The 1903 home with its outdoor walls 
and trees offers far more privacy than his former 3,800 sq ft rented 
house. It has an entertainment pavilion with an outdoor fireplace and 
built-in barbeque.

The New York dentist’s son has lived 
in Palo Alto almost continuously since he moved Facebook to Silicon 
Valley straight from his Harvard dormitory room in 2004.

The technology genius, originally from
 Dobbs Ferry in New York, inspired the 2010 film The Social Network, in 
which he is played by Jesse Eisenberg.

Mr Zuckerberg has vowed to embark on a
 mission to eat only what he killed and has reportedly been learning how
 to hunt with the aim of killing a bison which he will devour once it is
 dead.

The young tycoon, whose girlfriend is 
Priscilla Chan, has been studying how to fire a gun powerful enough to 
bring down one of the 2,000lb beasts and even got a licence to hunt, 
reports said.

He has killed chickens, lobsters, a 
pig and a goat as part of his crusade for responsible eating - and says 
he only wants to eat meat if he knows exactly where it came from and had
 a hand in its demise.
