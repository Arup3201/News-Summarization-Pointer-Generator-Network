Authorities have announced two more deaths caused when a FedEx tractor-trailer truck crossed a median and slammed into a bus packed with students this week.

Best friends Ismeal Jimenez and Denise Gomez have been identified as among the 10 people dead in a fiery wreck that investigators now say happened after the FedEx truck failed to brake in an effort to avoid the horrific accident.

Jimenez and Gomez were both seniors at Amino Inglewood Charter School, in Inglewood, according to NBC Southern California. Family members confirmed their deaths to the station.

He was an honors student who wanted to be an artist, she wanted to be a lawyer or a teacher, the station reported. Those dreams will be left unfulfilled.

'Heâ€™s in a much better place than this world that we live in,' said Jimenez's sister.

'She loved her family very much, and we all love her very much,' Gomez's aunt lamented.

Both were expecting to graduate high school this year.

The revelations came as National Transportation Safety Board investigators announced during a Saturday press conference that evidence points to the truck driver making no effort to avoid the crash.

'There are no tire marks anywhere,' an official told the media, according to KRCR.

The bus driver scrambled to avoid the collision, said the NTSB. Almost 150 feet of brake marks were found on the pavement at an angle that indicated the driver turned away from the truck.

Both drivers died in the accident.

Investigators plan to examine the truck's transmission to see what gear it was in at impact in an attempt to determine how fast it was traveling.

Claims it was on fire prior to the accident have not been able to be corroborated by the NTSB.

The truck clipped a car occupied by a couple before it slammed into the bus on Thursday evening, killing 10 people - five high school students, three chaperones and the drivers of both vehicles.

More than 30 people, mostly teenagers, were taken to local hospitals.

Their rental car was clipped and sent them hurtling into a ditch, just moments before the truck hit the bus head-on

'Somehow we survived,' she said.

Mrs Duran told the network she is sure the truck was on fire as it crossed the median strip toward them.

The crash occurred on Interstate 5 in Orland, which cuts through the heart of California's farming country about 90 miles north of Sacramento.

The students were traveling in three buses from the Los Angeles area to take part in a program at Humboldt State University - which allows prospective attendees to visit the campus - and represented 21 southern California high schools.

The two other buses in the caravan made it to the university.

Among those killed were an LA man and the woman he proposed to in December.

A 17-year-old twin was also among the confirmed dead, while her twin sister was in one of the other buses, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Another student, Adrian Castro, 18, has also been identified among those that perished.

He was a senior at El Monte High School who played on the school's fottball team

Michael Myvett, 29, and his fiancee Mattison Haywood were serving as chaperones on the bus.

Marisa Serrato, 17, was also confirmed among the dead.

Her twin, Marisol Serrato, was on a different bus that wasn't involved in the crash and made it safely to the school on Friday.

Marisol was accepted to Humboldt State
 University, while Marisa was waitlisted there. The two Norte Vista High
 School seniors decided to check out the campus.

'My
 sisters are real religious, smart, A students,' Miguel Serrato said. 
'They were going to get their high school diploma; they were looking 
toward the future.'

Myvett had given Haywood her engagement ring outside the Louvre art museum in Paris on Christmas Day, said his employers at the Center for Autism and Other Disorders in Torrance.

He had provided therapy for autistic children for the last two years.

He was 'able to connect with our kids on a level few others could, and he contributed to their wellbeing in such a positive and profound way,' the center's operations manager Kyle Farris said in a statement.

'Adrian Castro will be missed as a student and football player,' El Monte football coach Joel Sanchez told the Press-Telegram. 'He was a good young man with a bright future. He will always be remembered by the El Monte family.'

Although Castro was not a star football player, Raul Castro said his son always pushed himself.

'He was stubborn,' Mr. Castro said. 'When he wanted to do something, he applied himself until he finished it.'

Sergio Parra, 16, places a memorial message remembering the victims of a fiery crash between a tour bus and a FedEx truck in Orland, California

Workers clear the charred remains of a charter bus that collided with a FedEx tractor trailer on Interstate 5 in Orland, Calif. on Thursday, April 10. Ten people were killed in the crash and dozens more were injured

In Humboldt, Marisol had been trying to find her sister, calling around to hospitals for information, Serrato said.

'She
 says she believes that it's her fault because it was her idea to go 
check out that university,' Serrato said. 'She's devastated right now. I
 told her to keep her head up and have faith in God.'

A third chaperone killed in the crash, 
Humboldt State recruiter Arthur Arzola, was identified earlier Friday. 
The drivers of the bus and tractor-trailer and seven other students also died, 
but their names have not been released.
