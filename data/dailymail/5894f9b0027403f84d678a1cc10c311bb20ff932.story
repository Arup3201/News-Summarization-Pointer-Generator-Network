Aid minister Alan Duncan has urged David Cameron to avoid the ‘tokenistic’ promotion of women at the forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle.

He claimed that it would be wrong to give women top departmental jobs at the expense of more talented or experienced men.

Mr Duncan, Parliament’s first openly gay MP, said: ‘I never wanted to be a token gay and now things have progressed so there is no need for it. Nobody should want to be a token woman.’

The Prime Minister is expected to shake his top team up in the autumn, with Tories such as Amber Rudd, Nicky Morgan and Karen Bradley tipped for jobs.

Some male Conservative MPs are concerned that the drive to promote women means they will be overlooked.

Talented: Mr Duncan's boss Justine Greening

Mr Duncan, a junior minister at the Department for International Development, said his own boss Justine Greening was proof that talented women could advance to the front row on their own.

He told the Financial Times: ‘When I look around DfID... there’s enormous scope for women and no bar to their success.

‘There are moments when I think they run the place.’

Miss Greening was moved against her will at the last reshuffle in September 2012. She was previously Transport Secretary.

Mr Duncan said she had settled into her new aid job.

‘She’s thrown herself into it and earned respect very quickly, is absolutely on top of things, and she delegates very well.’

He added: ‘We started with three grey-haired Oxbridge men and now I’m the last man standing.’
