The world spewed far more carbon pollution into the air last year than ever before, with emissions spurred largely by China, the United States and India.

This is according to a recent report that estimated the world pumped 39.8 billion tons (36.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air last year by burning coal, oil and gas.

That is 778 million tons (706 metric tons) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year, despite increasingly urgent warnings over the need to curb greenhouse gases.

The world pumped 39.8 billion tons (36.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air last year by burning coal, oil and gas. That is 778 million tons (706 metric tons) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year, despite increasingly urgent warnings over the need to curb greenhouse gases

The report also said that China's per capita emissions had surpassed those of Europe for the first time, between 2013 and 2014.

Experts said at current rates the 'quota' for the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere without pushing the world beyond 2°C of warming could be used up within 30 years.

The report claims that the world is becoming committed to 'dangerous climate change' if it continues this trend.

In order to keep temperatures from rising by more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt, more than half the world's fossil fuel reserves may need to be left in the ground, they said.

Emissions, which are primarily caused by burning fossil fuels, will have to decline by more than 5 per cent a year to give the world a 50/50 chance of keeping temperature rises below the 2°C threshold.

The world pumped 39.8 billion tons (36.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide last year.

That is 778 million tons (706 metric tons) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year.

China's per capita emissions had surpassed those of Europe for the first time.

The quota for the total amount of CO2 released  without pushing the 
world beyond 2°C of warming could be used up within 30 years.

To prevent this, more than half the world's fossil fuel reserves may need 
to be left in the ground, report said.

Emissions will have to 
decline by more than five per cent a year to give the world a 50/50 chance 
of keeping temperature rises below the 2°C threshold.

This
 year's increase to 40 billion tonnes puts current global annual 
emissions two-thirds above 1990 levels.

China, the US, the European Union and 
India are the world's largest emitters.

Between them, they account for 58 
per cent of global carbon emissions and four-fifths of the growth in 
carbon output in 2013.

The UK's emissions were down 2.6 per cent, but over the longer term it 'exports' a third of its emissions.

This is by consuming goods and services which are produced elsewhere and once these are taken into account its carbon output has merely stabilised.

More than half of proven fossil fuel reserves may have to stay in the ground if governments are serious about a promise made in 2010 to limit a rise in average temperatures to 2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial times, the Global Carbon Project report by leading research institutes said.

The stark warning that time is running out to tackle spiralling greenhouse gas emissions comes ahead of a UN summit in New York this week to drive action in the run-up to talks in Paris next year, where it is hoped a global climate deal can be secured.

'A break in current emission trends is urgently needed,' according to the report by experts in Britain, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands.

Emissions by China alone, which overtook the United States as the number one carbon emitter in 2006 amid fast industrial growth, have soared to eclipse those of the United States and the European Union combined, it said.

Professor Corinne Le Quere, director of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: 'The human influence on climate change is clear.

'We need substantial and sustained reductions in CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels if we are to limit global climate change.

'We are nowhere near the commitments necessary to stay below 2C of climate change, a level that will already be challenging to manage for most countries around the world, even for rich nations.

'Politicians meeting in New York need to think very carefully about their diminishing choices exposed by climate science.'

Professor Le Quere is one of an international team of scientists from the Global Carbon Project, which has published the 'global carbon budget' analysis with a prediction for emissions in 2014 as well as an assessment for carbon dioxide output in 2013.

This year's increase to 40 billion tonnes puts current global annual emissions two-thirds above 1990 levels, the year against which attempts to cut greenhouse gases are commonly measured.

Historic and future carbon dioxide emissions must remain below a total of 3,200 billion tonnes to make it likely temperature rises do not exceed 2°C, the experts said, but 2,000 billion tonnes of the quota had already been used up.

The report comes just a day after huge number protest for greater action against climate change during the People's Climate March on September 21, 2014 in New York City

At current rates the quota for the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere without pushing the world beyond 2°C of warming could be used up within 30 years

On current rates the rest of the budget could be used up in 30 years, they said.

China, the US, the European Union and India are the world's largest emitters and between them account for 58 per cent of global carbon emissions and four-fifths of the growth in carbon output in 2013, the annual analysis said.

Last year China's emissions grew by 4.2 per cent, the US's carbon output was up 2.9 per cent, India's emissions grew 5.1 per cent, but the EU's emissions fell 1.8 per cent.

The UK's emissions were down 2.6 per cent, but over the longer term it 'exports' a third of its emissions by consuming goods and services which are produced elsewhere and once these are taken into account its carbon output has merely stabilised.

Emissions per person in China outstripped the EU for the first time, with emissions of two tonnes per person, compared to Europe's 1.9 tonnes, although the EU, like the UK, exports around a third of its emissions to places such as China.

Projected temperature change from 2081-2100. For the first time, the report connects hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers. Top scientists are saying that climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees

Globally emissions are expected to increase at a higher rate in 2014 than they did in 2013, when carbon dioxide output rose 2.3 per cent.

Professor Pierre Friedlingstein from the University of Exeter said: 'We have already used two-thirds of the total amount of carbon we can burn, in order to keep warming below the crucial 2°C level.

'If we carry on at the current rate, we will reach our limit in as little as 30 years' time - and that is without any continued growth in emission levels.

'The implication of no immediate action is worrying clear - either we take a collective responsibility to make a difference, and soon, or it will be too late.'

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will host a summit on September 23 of more than 120 world leaders, hoping for 'bold pledges' as part of work on a U.N. deal due to be agreed in Paris at the end of 2015 to limit global warming.
