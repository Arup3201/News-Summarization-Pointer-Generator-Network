It is being called the hardest rock climb on earth and for a while Kevin Jorgeson's attempt to scale the sheer face of Yosemite Park's El Capitan was hanging from the fingertips - literally.

But despite his torn and bleeding hands, Jorgeson cleared one of the 3,000 ft ascents most difficult stretches, after days of failed attempts and waiting.

Crowds of onlookers at the foot of the Dawn Wall at El Capitak broke into tears and cheers as Jorgeson, 30, finally grasped a razor sharp hold that had eluded him for days, clipped an anchor to secure himself and then screamed out in triumph, according to those who witnessed the dramatic climb.

"Pure joy," Jorgeson wrote afterward on his Facebook page, next to a photograph showing his bloody, bandaged hands.

Waiting: Tommy Caldwell is waiting for his colleague and climbing partner, Kevin Jorgeson to join him for the final ascent of the arduous El Capitan climb in California

Hands torn and bleeding, the second of two men attempting a grueling climb up a half-mile of sheer granite in California's Yosemite National Park cleared one of the ascent's most difficult stretches after days of failed attempts and waiting

Friday's climb keeps Jorgeson in the effort, after Caldwell moved several segments ahead of him. Caldwell is now 2,000 feet up, about 1,000 feet from finishing. Support crews have said they hope the two men will reach the top by mid-next week

Jorgeson, 30, of Santa Rosa, California, and Tommy Caldwell, 36, of Colorado are two weeks into what is billed as the first free climb of the vertical Dawn Wall to reach the 3,000-foot summit of El Capitan. Free climb means the men are climbing without the aid of pegs, ropes or other gear to help them ascend, although they are using safety gear to guard against what could be deadly falls.

Friday's climb keeps Jorgeson in the effort, after Caldwell moved several segments ahead of him. Caldwell is now 2,000 feet up, about 1,000 feet from finishing. Support crews have said they hope the two men will reach the top by mid-next week.

Indeed, Caldwell is only 1,000 feet from finishing the groundbreaking climb.

Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell are attempting to become the first men to free-climb - using only hands and feet - the Dawn Wall of the park's towering El Capitan rock formation.

On Thursday, Caldwell climbed to a ledge 2,000 feet up, says Tom Evans, a photographer and climber who has been chronicling the journey.

His partner, however, is hundreds of feet below.

Stuck: Kevin Jorgensen is still nursing the split skin on his fingers as he struggles at a lower-down point

Jorgeson, 30, is struggling to recover from splitting open the skin on the fingertips of his index and middle fingers of his right hand. 

This has severely hampered his efforts to keep up with his partner, and led to the pair taking three ‘rest days’ in the hope the skin will heal.

This weekend, after a short break, Jorgeson plans to try surpassing the particularly difficult section lower down once more. 

Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson are relying completely on their physical strength and dexterity to make their way up the Dawn Wall, a vertical face on one side of El Capitan. 

Caldwell could become the first to accomplish the feat. 

Progress: Caldwell makes his way up the rock face last Sunday. If all goes well, he could do it this weekend

The men have been climbing toward the 3,000-foot summit for two weeks. 

Speaking from the foot of the Dawn Wall at the start, Tom Evans, a fellow climber and photographer in contact with the pair, told the Daily Mail their spirits are still high.

‘They remain determined to complete the climb,’ he says. 

‘They are definitely going for the top. They say they are not coming down until they’ve got there. The human body is not designed to take the kind of abuse they are enduring up there.

‘The granite flakes when you grip it, creating tiny razor-sharp edges which cut the skin deep. Kevin has taped up his fingers to protect them, but underneath, the skin is dry like toast.’ 

While many people have climbed the Dawn Wall — renowned for its smooth surface — using ropes and metal pins, no one has ever free-climbed it in a single attempt. 

Although the pair are clipped to ropes, they must not use them to help in the ascent. Instead, the ropes are to stop them falling if they misjudge a move or lose a grip with their fingers or feet.

The men, who started the expedition on December 27, begin their climbing day shortly after 3pm, just two hours before sunset. December and January were picked for the climb in the hope it would be cold — sunlight and warmth cause fingers to sweat and so lose grip.

Climbing shoes are also nowhere near as effective at clinging to the rock if the rubber gets warm because it becomes softer.

But Yosemite National Park has been unusually warm this winter, so they are forced to do most of their climbing during the chill of night, using head torches.

Precarious: The climbers have been living in a vertical world for weeks 

Logistics: Aside from the actual climbing, the climbers have a great deal of work to do managing their ropes on the long climb

At the dead of night, temperatures can plummet to well below freezing, as ice-cold winds sweep across the face of the rock.

At midnight, after nine hours of climbing, they clamber into their ‘portaledges’ — 4ft by 6ft tents that hang from ropes fixed to the cliff face. Each has a stove to cook dried pasta, chilli and vegetables, brought by a six-strong support network of porters who haul food along with 12 gallons of water in huge sacks up the ropes to their precarious camp.

On occasion, the pair have even celebrated the completion of a particularly demanding section with a swig or two of whisky — ‘to take off the edge’, Caldwell says.

Before bed, they treat their cuts, grazes and bruises. Writing from his tent via social media, Caldwell says: ‘It’s the most chapping environment in the world up here. Windy. Cold. Super dry. [It feels like] we’re grabbing razor blades. I wake up twice a night and reapply lotion to my hands.’

Bizarrely, they are not alone — a photographic team and film crew, charting their ascent, camps alongside them. ‘We have three double “portaledges” set up. It’s like a five-star hotel up here!’ Caldwell says. In truth, few hotel guests face the prospect of falling rocks and ice hitting them as they sleep.

They wake at 10am and have breakfast. By then the sun is out and they use solar-powered devices to charge their smart phones, and report back via social media to base camp, as well as family, friends and supporters.

Tom Evans believes Jorgeson and Caldwell — who have trained for six years — could complete the challenge by early next week.

The greatest threat would be a turn for the worse in the weather, or an acute injury to the hands. But even that might not stop this remarkable pair from conquering what is surely one of nature’s greatest challenges.
