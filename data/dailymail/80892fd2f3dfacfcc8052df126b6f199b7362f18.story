Millions of ordinary investors will be given the chance to snap up free shares in Lloyds spin-off TSB.

Lloyds has confirmed plans to start floating the new challenger bank on the stock market next month. 

TSB is still remembered by many for its 1980’s slogan ‘the bank that likes to say yes’.

But it was re-launched in September almost twenty years after disappearing from the UK High Street.

It is made up of 631 branches Lloyds was forced to sell off by the European Commission as a condition of its £20billion bail out by taxpayers during the financial crisis.

A quarter of the shares will be sold initially, with the offer open to ordinary retail investors as well as institutional investors such as pension funds. 

To entice retail investors they will be offered one free ‘loyalty’ share for every 20 they buy, as long as they hang on to them for at least a year.    

Lloyds wants to prevent savers from trying to make a quick profit by cashing in their shares early- as happened with the float of Royal Mail last October.

But investors will have to wait until 2017 before TSB is in a position to hand out dividends.

Retail investors will only be allowed to buy a fifth of the shares on offer, with the remainder allocated to institutional investors.

Lloyds will also foot the bill for any mis-selling that occurred under its watch, including payment protection insurance which has cost the bank almost £10billion so far.

The announcement comes just days after over-50s cruise and finance firm Saga launched a £2.1billion float on the stockmarket.

Half of the shares were bought by retail investors, but the float was considered a flop as the shares were sold on the cheap.

Chief executive Paul Pester (above) said TSB would be different from other scandal-hit lenders on the High Street

Yesterday chief executive Paul Pester launched an appeal to customers and potential investors, promising that TSB would be different from the other scandal-hit lenders on the High Street.

‘We are building a very straightforward simple bank where every penny invested by savers is only used to support mortgages and loans to other TSB customers.’

He added: ‘You can never say never. But I’m doing everything in my power to minimise the likelihood that there will be a new mis-selling scandal at TSB.’

Offloading the branches has proved a major headache for Lloyds, with the Co-op pulling out of a £750million deal to buy the branches last April.

Lloyds has run up a £1.6billion bill to create a separate lender, which it called TSB – resurrecting a brand which disappeared when Lloyds merged with TSB in 1995.

Launched in September, TSB has 4.5million customers  - most of whom were transferred from Lloyds TSB and Cheltenham & Gloucester.

TSB is the seventh biggest bank on the High Street, but is planning to boost its share of the market and expand its network of branches.

Lloyds has to sell off the rest of TSB by the EC deadline which falls at the end of next year.

The first sell off next month will also clear the way for the Government to sell off a third tranche of taxpayers’ stake in Lloyds in the Autumn.

It is expected to finally open up the offer to retail investors, having raised £7.4billion from selling two tranches of shares to institutional investors.

This has reduced taxpayers’ stake from 39pc to 25pc.
