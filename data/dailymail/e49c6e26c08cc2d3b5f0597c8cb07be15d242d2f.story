Abasteceme - which translates as 'Supply Me' - is a free Android loo paper-finding app for Venezuelans

Thousands of desperate Venezuelans have downloaded a smartphone app which helps them to find toilet paper.

Loo roll has been in short supply in the South American country in recent months, with economists blaming price controls imposed by the government.

The new programme, launched last week, uses crowdsourcing technology - based on Google Maps and geolocation - to enable users to let each other know which supermarkets still have stocks of the tissue.

Called Abasteceme - which translates as 'Supply Me' - the free Android app has already been downloaded more than 12,000 times.

Creator Jose Augusto Montiel said most downloads have been made by residents from the capital Caracas.

The 21-year-old chemical engineering student said: 'Lots of things are in short supply, but what people are most worried about is finding toilet paper.

'People never knew how much they needed it until it started running out.'

Venezuelan
 president Nicolas Maduro claims anti-government forces are deliberately
 buying up basics like toilet paper to destabilise the country.

He recently promised to import 50million extra rolls to boost supplies.

Other basic items in short supply across the country include wheat flour, soap and butter.

'From what I've seen so far, it's mostly toilet paper, followed by flour,' Montiel said about what gets posted most.

He
 said most of Abasteceme's users were in Caracas when he first made the 
app available on the Google Play website on May 29 - but it has now 
spread all over the nation.

Montiel said he has no help beyond his sister, who assists with the programme's aesthetics.

'I'm also working to develop it for the BlackBerry as a lot of people have them in Venezuela,' he added.

Commerce Minister Alejandro Fleming blamed the shortage of toilet tissue on 'excessive demand' built up as a result of 'a media campaign that has been generated to disrupt the country'.

'The revolution will bring the country the equivalent of 50million rolls of toilet paper,' he said last month.

'We are going to saturate the market so that our people calm down.'

Finance Minister Nelson Merentes said the government was also addressing the lack of foreign currency, which has resulted in the suspension of foreign supplies of raw materials, equipment and spare parts to Venezuelan companies, disrupting their production.

'We are making progress ... we have to work very hard,' he said.

Fleming said monthly consumption of toilet paper was normally 125million rolls, but that current demand 'leads us to think that 40 million more are required.'
