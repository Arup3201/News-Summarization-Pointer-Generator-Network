Anne Hathaway has expressed her 'deep regret' at disappointment she caused after switching her Oscars gown at the last minute.

The Les Miserables star, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar on Sunday night, had planned to wear a gown by her good friend Valentino Garavani, but at the last minute elected to wear a pale pink Prada creation instead.

In a statement issued to People, she explained: 'It came to my attention late Saturday 
night that there would be a dress worn to the Oscars that is remarkably 
similar to the Valentino I had intended to wear, and so I decided it was
best for all involved to change my plans.'

Given the cold shoulder: Anne Hathaway decided last-minute to wear Prada to the Oscars, despite being expected to wear a custom-made gown by her long-time favorite designer and friend, Valentino

She insisted that the trade was not 
intended as a snub to Valentino, who designed the wedding gown she wore 
to marry husband Adam Shulman last September.

'Though I love the dress I did wear, it 
was a difficult last minute decision as I had so looked forward to 
wearing Valentino in honor of the deep and meaningful relationship I 
have enjoyed with the house and with Valentino himself,' she continued.

'I deeply regret any disappointment caused.'

Too similar? Ms Hathaway's decision was prompted when she saw Amanda Seyfried's Alexander McQueen gown, which was apparently very similar to the Valentino number she had been set to wear

Ms Hathaway made reference to the gown switch when interviewed by Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet on Sunday.

'I didn't know what I was wearing until about three hours ago,' she told him. 'This was the one that spoke to me in the end.'

Her
dress choice undoubtedly came as a surprise to Valentino, whose fashion
house sent out a press release just before the awards show stating that
it would be dressing Anne Hathaway, Sally Field and Jennifer Aniston.

According to Fashionista, the actress's impulse decision was prompted when she saw Amanda Seyfried's Alexander McQueen lace gown, which was apparently very similar to the Valentino number she was slated to wear.

Memorable fashion moment: Valentino designed the romantic pale pink gown and headpiece that Ms Hathaway wore to marry Adam Shulman last September

Close friends: Valentino (pictured with Ms Hathaway in one of his designs at the 2011 Oscars) has said that the actress is 'like my daughter'

Wanting to stand out from her Les Miserables co-star, Ms Hathaway reportedly 'freaked out,' 
requiring her stylist Rachel Zoe to call in several different dresses 
just before the event.

Whatever
the reason for her outfit choice, the 30-year-old certainly caused a 
stir in her backless pink satin Prada gown - complete with a very perky 
bust line - which she accessorized with a sparkling Tiffany necklace.

Ms Hathaway has a long history of friendship with 80-year-old Valentino, who has said of the actress: 'She's a very good friend of mine. She's like my daughter.'

She has worn a number of his 
creations to awards ceremonies - including the bold red strapless number she 
wore to host the Oscars in 2011.
