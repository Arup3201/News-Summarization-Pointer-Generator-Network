A father is footing $18,000 in fines because his son constantly drove across a toll bridge thinking he could just pay later. 

Tom Rose from Poulsbo, Washington, says his son crossed the 520 bridge in Seattle every day to get to work - generating a huge bill. 

He forgot to open an account with the company who runs the bridge, Good To Go, thinking he could save up instead. 

Enormous fines: Tom Rose from Poulsbo, Washington, says his son crossed the 520 bridge in Seattle every day to get to work - generating a $18,000 bill (file picture)

Each time the vehicle crosses a bridge, a computer-generated system automatically charges the driver.  

Mr Rose insists he never received a bill and only discovered the staggering fee when he tried to sell his car.

According to KING 5 the bill included $1,360 in tolls and more than $16,000 in penalties.

When the pair raised the issue with the company, they were told to contact an administrative judge, but were warned they would probably not be successful in their appeal.

'They need to pay their tolls. We all need to do our part,' Mr Rose told the station. 'But to not have a proper recourse, and not have the administrative process correct, is really an affront. It's almost an abuse.

'We would welcome any type of remediation in this. A second look, that would be great.'

After Mr Rose contacted the company they found out the bills had been returned because they did not have the correct address. 

They have agreed to work with Mr Rose and find out the best way to pay - but he is still responsible for the total. 

The billing system has been criticized by motorists. A group of attorneys have even come together and have filed a class action lawsuit against the Washington Department of Transport
