George Osborne is preparing to face down demands to increase the 40p tax rate which has hit an extra 1million workers since the coalition was formed.

The Chancellor is under growing pressure to stop dragging more middle-class earners into the tax bracket which was once targeted at the wealthy. Workers now get hit with the 40p rate when they earn £41,450 a year.

But with a rise to £44,000 costing the Treasury £1.5billion, Mr Osborne is expected to instead to turn focus his focus on lower earners in next week's Budget.

By freezing or lowering the 40p tax rate, the number of earners caught in the bracket has risen to 4.4million under the coalition

The flagship Lib Dem tax policy has been to increase the amount workers can earn before paying income tax at all, and will reach £10,000 in April this year.

But to help pay for it, Mr Osborne has frozen or lowered the point at which workers start paying the 40p rate.

In 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate.

But this year the threshold has fallen to £41,450, which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate.  In 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate.

Critics say the higher rate is no longer 
faced only by the ‘highly paid few’ but hitting middle earners like 
teachers, nurses and small businesses.

The national minimum wage is to increase by 19p an hour to £6.50 later this year, giving more than a million workers a pay rise.

The rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will go up by 10p to £5.13 an hour - a 2 per cent increase.

For 16 and 17-year-olds the statutory rate will rise by 7p to GBP3.79, also 2 per cent.

The minimum wage for apprentices will go up by 5p to £2.73 an hour, with all the new rates coming into force in October.

The Government said it had accepted recommendations from the low Pay Commission, including plans for bigger increases in future than in recent years.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'The recommendations I have accepted today mean that low-paid workers will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take home pay since 2008.

'This will benefit over one million workers on national minimum wage and marks the start of a welcome new phase in minimum wage policy.'

With the Lib Dem policy implemented in full, and another £500 rise in the income tax threshold to £10,500 expected in next week’s Budget, Tory pressure has mounted for action to help middle earners.

Conservatives say the time has come for Mr Osborne to do something for the ‘squeezed middle’ earning between £40,000 and £60,000

Nick de Bois said: ‘Paying 40 pence to the government of every pound earned over the present threshold of £41,450 is at best demoralising. At worst, it can kill ambition and undermine aspiration.

‘The number of workers paying the higher 40p tax rate is expected to rise from 4.4 million this year to more than 6 million in 2015 because the threshold rate will not increase in line with inflation.’

John Redwood told The Times: ‘It is affecting not just those at the threshold limit, who find that a payrise disappears, but people further down the income scale with aspirations. We need lower taxes across the board.’

However, the Treasury insists that anyone earning less than £100,000 has benefited at least in part from the increase in the income tax threshold to £10,000, although basic rate payers have saved most – worth £700-a-year.

A spokesman said: 'The government believes the most effective way to support those on low and middle incomes, and to help them to be more financially secure, is to enable them to keep more of the money they earn.

'That is why we have taken significant steps to increase the personal allowance – the amount an individual can earn before paying income tax.

'Although these increases have been targeted at low and middle income earners, higher rate taxpayers have also benefited.

'As a result, a typical higher rate taxpayer will be around £56 better of this year than under inherited plans.'

Increases in the threshold at which workers start paying tax mean the number of basic rate taxpayers has fallen by almost 3million since 2010

Senior Tories say they have been told Mr Osborne will not act on the 40p rate because of the huge costs involved.

Meanwhile, Mr Osborne is facing calls to use any spare cash to offer a £5.4 billion National Insurance break for businesses.

Right-leaning think-tank Policy Exchange argues the move would provide an incentive to boost jobs, pay and productivity and save firms £250 for each worker they employ.

It urged the Chancellor to focus on increasing the 2015/16 employer NI threshold to £192 per week, the equivalent of £10,000 per year, instead of changes to income tax.
