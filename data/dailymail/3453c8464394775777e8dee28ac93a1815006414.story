Facing a jail sentence: Sebastian Crump yesterday

A former Cabinet Office digital expert is facing jail after being caught with a huge stash of nearly 400 child porn images.

Sebastian Crump amassed depraved images of child abuse while working as digital communications manager advising the Government on its own website.

Now questions are being asked about why it took six months to emerge that a government official had been arrested over child pornography allegations.

Police discovered indecent images were being streamed from Mr Crump’s home computer IP address in April last year.

But incredibly last November – while he was still being investigated – he received a promotion at the Cabinet Office, where he had previously worked in internal communications.

When Crump, 39, was arrested in January this year Scotland Yard did not publicise the arrest. He was only named when he was charged last month, but even then the Metropolitan Police did not reveal his role at the Cabinet Office.

Details can only now be revealed after he pleaded guilty to four charges of making and distributing indecent images of children.

Yesterday Crump – who has spent a decade working in technology and communications for Government offices, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Central Office of Information – insisted: ‘I’m not a paedophile.’

The case has reignited a row over secret arrests by police involving government officials accused of child porn offences.

Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘When they sat on the case for such a long time and then hid the fact that he is a senior civil servant, it causes great concern.

‘It does raise serious questions and alarm bells are ringing loudly.’ The Cabinet Secretary has already been asked to investigate the handling of a separate arrest of one of David Cameron’s closest aides.

Patrick Rock, deputy director of the No 10 policy unit, was arrested on suspicion of hoarding images of naked children in February.

The National Crime Agency refused to confirm or deny Mr Rock had been held or the existence of any inquiry, which was finally revealed by this newspaper.

Mr Rock was brought in to Downing Street as deputy head of policy in 2011, and was involved in drawing up Government policy on tackling online child abuse images.

Although Sebastian Crump’s work did not involve any child protection issues, the Mail can reveal he landed a government job after working as a children’s charity website manager.

The IT expert worked for Action for Children, which helps support vulnerable and neglected children, between 1998 and 1999.

Last year while he was under investigation, he shared a picture on his Facebook page urging 11-year-old children to be safe on the internet.

City of Westminster Magistrates Court heard that Crump hoarded nearly 400 indecent images of children, 82 of which were classed as the most extreme.

At his £800,000 terraced home in Wandsworth, South London, police found 375 images and video files involving child and animal abuse.

The court heard that Crump’s marriage had collapsed following his arrest. He pleaded guilty on Thursday to three counts of making an indecent image of a child and one count of distributing an indecent photograph of a child.

But yesterday Crump insisted he was not a paedophile.

Dressed in purple trousers, with dark glasses and a straw cowboy hat covering his frizzy ginger hair, the keen musician, who is part of the British Humanists Association Choir, emerged from his home in Southfields, South London.

He insisted ‘I’m not a paedophile’, before sprinting off.

Crump is on bail ahead of sentencing at Southwark Crown Court on August 28. A Cabinet Office spokesman said Crump was suspended in January and quit in March.
