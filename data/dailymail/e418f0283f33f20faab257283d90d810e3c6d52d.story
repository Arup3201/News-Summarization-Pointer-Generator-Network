CCTV has been released of the shocking moments when a gang terrorised post office staff with a gun and a knife in a daylight raid on the £20,000 contents of a security van.

The footage shows two masked robbers armed with a gun and a knife entering a post office in Halton, West Yorkshire just after a security van arrives to replenish the cash machine.

The members of the gang who took the cash box from the post office worker have now been jailed for a total of 40 years.

The members of the gang who carried out the terrifying daylight raid were all eventually caught thanks to CCTV footage and the safeguards of the cash box they stole

Throughout the whole ordeal, the terrified guard and post office staff are crammed into a corner as the masked men point the knife and handgun at them.

The they appear to lead the helmet-wearing post office worker who was delivering the cash box outside, before heading back to their car.

A short clip at the end of the footage, taken from the secure van, shows the men calmly get back into a silver Vauxhall with fake number plates and and speed away with the cash box.

The large man wielding the knife in the footage is Ryan Patterson, 29, one of three men who was sentenced to jail at Leeds Crown Court, alongside Matthew Richardson, 29, and Gavin Ross, 28.

The post office worker calmly leaves his secure van to replenish the cash inside the cash machine, unaware that his arrival was being watched

The court heard the three men were part of a gang that committed two 'callous' crimes.

First was the post office robbery, then afterwards came an unsuccessful attempt to attach a cashpoint in a shop to the back of a Honda and drive it away.

Footage shows the thieves burst into the store, manhandle the staff, and then wreck parts of the store to make way for a cable that they attach to the ATM.

However, when the cable breaks, the thieves have to make a run for it empty handed, simply driving away in their car.

Ryan Patterson, jailed for 11 years and 3 months

Gavin Ross, who was jailed for 18 years

Matthew Richardson, jailed for 11 years

As with the post office crime, the robbers were armed, but this time they were brandishing machetes.

Leeds Crown Court, heard the raid on the post office left staff so traumatised they now have trouble sleeping and feel stresed and anxious every time cash is now delivered or picked up from the premises.

His Honour Judge Tom Bayliss QC said: 'This I make clear is the human costs of crimes such as this.

'Post offices provide a valuable service to the whole community. Communities rely on post offices.

'Those who work in them and deliver to them are vulnerable.

The members of the gang then lead the helmet-wearing post office worker out of the store, forcing him to walk in front of them

'These were very well planned robberies, each participant played an important, valid and, no doubt pre-determined role.'

David Gordon, prosecuting, told the court, that two of the robbers entered the post office, where there was also the post master, a member of staff and an elderly customer.

Mr Gordon said: 'Both masked men, one of a distinctive tall and large build, were armed, one with a handgun and the other with a knife.

'Patterson was the large man. He had the knife.

'The security guard was threatened with the gun.'

The guard was unable to open the box so the gang took it, they tried to get cash from the van, but didn’t suceed, before 'making good' their getaway.

Not long after police were alerted to the Vauxhall, which had been dumped nearby.

Mr Gordon said: 'By the time police arrived in Whitkirk the security box had been damaged and the money taken from inside.'

He told the court that a security device in the box had been activated when they opened it and had stained the banknotes with blue dye.

Members of the gang also faced charges for a failed raid on Osmondthorpe post office after they successfully robbed a post office

They then drag the cable into the store from the car, looking for the shops cashpoint

They run through the store brandishing machetes (or large knives) and threatening the staff inside

It was when cops investigated the car and its purchase that they made a connection to Ross through phone records.

When they went to his home they found several bills stained with dye.

They same dye appeared on a shirt of Patterson’s when he was arrested just days after the robbery.Mr Gordon said:

'Patterson was also seen in Asda stores in the days following the robbery apparently at cash tills at which subsequently a significant number of blue bank notes were uncovered.'

By the time of the attempted ATM robbery, 6 January 2013, Patterson, of Leeds, was in custody.

They tip over one of the store's racks of produce to make room for the cable that is attached to their car

While one member is trashing the store to make way for a cable, the other decides he is going to manhandle the employee, pulling the employee's top over his head

The thieves attach the cable to the ATM before running it back through to their car

Following the failed robbery Ross was linked to the purchase of the car by phone records and Richardson took delivery of the vehicle.

The court heard that Richardson told a sales assistant if anyone asked who bought the car she should say a 'black lad' did.

All three men were arrested after their respective crimes and later charged with conspiracy to commit robbery.

While Patterson and Richardson pleaded guilty to the charge, Ross was found guilty at trial.

Ross was also sentenced for producing cannabis whilst on a suspended sentence for supplying cannabis.

Richardson was also sentenced for his involvment in yet another masked robbery, this time at a dairy warehouse.

Ross was jailed for a total of 18 years, Richardson for a total of 11 years and four months and Patterson for 11 years and three months.

All three men have extensive criminal records.

Detective Inspector Richard Holmes from West Yorkshire police said: 'These were very serious offences committed by offenders who thought nothing of threatening innocent people with weapons including a gun and knives.

'They were terrifying ordeals for the victims and witnesses involved who, despite the trauma they suffered, co-operated fully with the investigation that brought these men to justice.

'The significant sentences they have received reflect the seriousness with which the courts treat offences of this nature.

'This case should serve to remind people that the police will leave no stone unturned when it comes to tracking down and convicting offenders such as these.'
