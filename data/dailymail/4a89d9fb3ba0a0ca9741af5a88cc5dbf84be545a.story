For months celebrity women wanting to shine on the red carpet have been flashing a sliver of bosom.

But the side boob's days could be numbered as more and more A-listers switch to another revealing trend: the 'bum slip'.

Unlike the classic builder's bum, a bum slip occurs when a pair of too-short shorts or a micro skirt is worn, with the result that the lower part of the derriere is on show.

Once a sartorial no-no, the bum slip is swiftly overtaking the side boob as the red carpet flash of choice, with everyone from Rihanna to Miley Cyrus getting in on the act.

Ever the early adopter, Kate Moss was one of the first to be seen flashing her rear in public when she attended Carine Roitfeld's party at the Hotel Shangri-La during Paris Fashion Week.

The 39-year-old mother of one arrived at the soir√©e sporting a bizarre black net catsuit and tuxedo jacket combo by Saint Laurent, which covered her top half but left her backside exposed.

Her catwalk colleagues have also given the revealing look their seal of approval with Marc Jacobs sending Cara Delevingne down the catwalk at Louis Vuitton wearing a skimpy pair of pink silk shorts - with just a coat to spare her blushes.

In Los Angeles, Miley Cyrus was spotted running errands in a pair of Daisy Dukes that left absolutely nothing to the imagination, while Eva Longoria appeared on the red carpet in a dress with a gargantuan bow in place of a skirt that barely covered her behind.

Although the bum slip hasn't been doing the red carpet round for long, it has made more regular appearances on stage.

Madonna, Rihanna and Lady Gaga all have form on the derriere flashing front, with Rihanna's micro shorts and Gaga's carnivalesque costumes leaving little covered up.

Both have been known to tackle the trend offstage, as has Britney Spears, whose passion for teeny tiny denim shorts has left her rear on show on more than one occasion.

Even Rihanna's friend Rita Ora has tapped into the trend, although on some occasions - most noticeably at the BRIT Awards - she's come slightly too close for comfort to the traditional builder's bum.

While pregnancy has curtailed Kim Kardashian's more risque fashion choices, the star hasn't given up on flashing the flesh, although in her case, it was more inadvertent than intentional.

Photographed heading to the gym in a pair of too-tight leggings, Kim's version of the bum slip was more full moon than sexy glimpse.
