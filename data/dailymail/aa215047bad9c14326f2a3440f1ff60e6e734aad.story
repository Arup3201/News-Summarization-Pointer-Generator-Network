A student posed as an online buyer to lure the owners of Rolex and Cartier watches into armed robberies, a court heard yesterday.

Well-spoken Lauren Lafayette-Ede made appointments to view the watches after spotting them on auction websites eBay and Gumtree.

But she was merely acting as a front for a pair of robbers armed with Uzi sub-machine guns and Tasers.

Lauren Lafayette-Ede, 20, targeted people trying
to sell their valuables online. She would visit their home and leave 
the door open for the gang. One man was attacked at gunpoint in Kensal 
Rise, north-west London after offering to sell his Hublot Big Bang watch
for £5,500 (left); another for his £8,800 Rolex Daytona (right)

When it malfunctioned, giving him only a ‘light tickling sensation’, the others threatened Javed Ali’s family at gunpoint.

On another occasion, Christopher Mills was threatened with a gun at his home in Kensal Rise, north London, after offering to sell his Hublot Bing Bang watch for £5,500.

A week later, the robbers held an Uzi to the head of doctor Dominque Wong-Ahkye at his home and demanded his £8,800 Rolex Daytona watch.

Lafayette-Ede, who was 19 at the time of the robberies, was yesterday described in court as the ‘acceptable face’ of the plot.

Her lawyer told Snaresbrook Crown Court in north-east London, that she became involved because of the ‘unhealthy relationship she had with Mr Gregg-Ball’.

Sentencing her to four years in a young offenders’ institution, Judge John Lafferty said: ‘Before these offences took place you were doing all that society asked of you.

You were a hard-working, decent, honest young woman, well on your way to the kind of future that would have made your parents proud and given you a rich and rewarding life.

‘But you fell under the influence of Mr Gregg-Ball, and that is where this criminality springs from.‘I don’t accept that you were placed under any real pressure, other than the pressure you placed on yourself to keep your boyfriend happy.’

Lafayette-Ede, with boyfriend Rhys Gregg-Ball 20, found the jewellery sellers on eBay and Gumtree

The robbery spree ended when the 17-year-old accomplice tried to rob Hannah Hatt, 33, of her £1,900 diamond ring which she had advertised on Gumtree. During the raid, Miss Hatt, a project manager, and her boyfriend James Smith, 31, managed to overpower the robber and held him until the police arrived.

Judge Lafferty awarded Miss Hatt and Mr Smith £500 each for stopping ‘a highly organised and dangerous conspiracy to rob people’.

Gregg-Ball, of Sydenham, south London; Lafayette-Ede, of Ramsgate, Kent; and the 17-year-old youth, of Lewisham, south London, all admitted conspiracy to rob.

Gregg-Ball was earlier jailed for eight years and the 17-year-old was sent to a young offenders’ institution for five years.

David Kitson, defending Lafayette-Ede, said: ‘She did these things because of her need to remain involved in the unhealthy relationship she had with Mr Gregg-Ball. She does deeply regret becoming involved.’
