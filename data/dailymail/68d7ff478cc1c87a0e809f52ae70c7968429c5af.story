Spain's King and Queen will not be celebrating their Golden Wedding anniversary in any fashion, the country's royal court has confirmed.

King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia's announcement that they will hold neither a public nor private party on May 14 has fuelled speculation they are actually 'estranged'.

In recent months they have rarely been seen out in public, and rumours have abounded of the King's 'roving eye' - with some suggesting he has bedded more than 1,500 women.

But others claim the move is designed to appease Spaniards still angry with their monarch for going on a lavish £27,000 elephant hunting safari in Botswana last month.

The extravagant trip, which only came to light when the 74-year-old returned to Spain after breaking his hip, came as the number of jobless in the country soared to almost one in four.

His sheepish and unprecedented act of royal contrition, said as he stood outside the Madrid hospital where he was operated, went some way to healing his relationship with the public.

A lack of a party, observers say, will again show the King is in some way getting back in touch with his subjects and willing to undergo the same austerity.

The decision is in stark contrast to 
their 1987 silver wedding anniversary, when couples from all over Spain 
who wed on the same 1962 day attended a party at the Zarzuela palace.

And it comes during a tricky time for the King, who is facing his first bout of criticism from the Spanish press.

They
have often been reluctant to criticise the man who relinquished power 
to ensure a successful transition to democracy following the death of 
dictator Francisco Franco in the late 1970s.

But
the mood has changed since the controversial African elephant hunt, 
with some even making calls for him to abdicate and hand over power to 
his son Prince Felipe.

The 
rumours of his alleged infidelities are also increasing, even in the 
Spanish press, with claims surfacing in several books that he is a 
real-life Don Juan.

Just three months ago an explosive 
book, by Barcelona-based author Pilar Eyre, claimed he was a 'serial 
womaniser' who had bedded more than 1,500 women.

The
Solitude of the Queen labelled him a 'professional seducer' who once 
tried to seduce Princess Diana and who has had numerous affairs.

It
said that he has not shared a bed with his wife Queen Sofia for the 
past 35 years and claimed she stumbled upon her husband with one of his 
alleged  lovers, the Spanish film star Sara Montiel, at a friend’s 
country house in Toledo in 1976.

Following the ill-fated hunting trip, reports also said Queen Sofia only visited him at his bedside for 26 minutes.

It
prompted royal commentator and former director of ABC newspaper, Jose 
Antonio Zarzalejos, to say: 'The failure of his marriage to Queen Sofia,
from whom he is practically separated, is public knowledge.'

There are also claims he has been in a
'relationship' with a woman 28 years his junior for six years. She was 
alleged to have been on the Botswana trip with him.

It has not been a good time for the once much-loved royal family.

The
King's son-in-law Inaki Urdangarin is a suspect in a corruption case, 
accused of using his position to embezzle several million euros in 
public contracts through a not-for-profit foundation.

The King has sought to distance himself from the case in recent months.

But
this week he was dragged into the thick of it after reports emerged of 
emails allegedly implicating him in the business dealings.

Then,
over Easter, the king's 13-year-old grandson shot himself in the foot 
with a shotgun, even though by law in Spain you must be 14 to handle a 
gun.

Polls this month revealed Juan Carlos' popularity is at its lowest since he came to the throne in 1975.

The Catalan town of Berga last week even took the radical step of voting him a 'persona non grata'.

His
recovery from hip replacement surgery also means he will miss Queen 
Elizabeth II's official Diamond Jubilee celebration lunch at Windsor 
Castle on May 18.
