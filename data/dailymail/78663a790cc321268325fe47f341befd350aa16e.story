A disturbing report has revealed some of the disgusting conditions visitors experience in Australian hotels, with faecal matter discovered on kitchen utensils.

An investigation into the Broadbeach Savannah Resort on the Gold Coast in Queensland has uncovered severely unhygienic conditions, despite the fact the hotel is accredited as a ‘four star hotel’.

The ‘hotel from hell’ was inspected by A Current Affair after teams of negative reviews and concerning photographs were posted online from disturbed guests.

Biotech scientists took swabs of the rooms and were revolted by what they discovered.

The most concerning were faecal particles on the kitchen’s chopping board.

‘Mould on the taps, on the wall fittings, the mirror wasn’t cleaned properly, it’s just really grubby,’ former hotel guest Michael (pictured) explained

‘The fact that we found faecal choloforms means that they’re not cleaning it properly at the end when people move out,’ biotech scientist Glen Pinna told A Current Affair.

Swabs of glasses and mugs from the kitchen found bacteria levels that are twenty times the acceptable standard.

‘They should have less than six bacteria per square centimetre. We found it had in excess of 120 bacteria,’ said Dr Pinna.

The presence of such a high level of bacteria could have catastrophic effects on the health of guests, meaning contracting a sickness during their holiday is highly likely.

"We're now looking at a situation where you could actually get sick by using some of these facilities," Mr Pinna said.

‘If someone’s had food poisoning, were getting over it and they’ve used that glass, there’s every chance (the germ) is going to be on it and it’s then going to be passed onto the next people that stay in the room.’

Discoloured and hole-ridden curtains were a shock discovery from guests expecting four star accommodation. However, despite the awful exterior, the unseen bacteria and faecal matter should be holiday makers biggest concern

Last week, a Perth family who stayed in the hotel were horrified when their two-year-old daughter suffered flea bites from playing on the carpet in the hotel, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin.

Despite being charged $2500 for their week-long stay, the Fergusons found ‘the bathroom was mouldy, the carpets filthy, there were only three chairs and the louvres were broken.

They were offered another room but claim it was ‘just in the same condition.’

Manager Shawwal Khalil told the Bulletin that their four-star rating was legitimate as it had been awarded by Star Rating Australia.

He also claimed Star Rating Australia gave the hotel 90 per cent for cleanliness.

After A Current Affair’s investigation, Mr Khalil also claimed that the reason so many people complain is because they have deliberately damaged property in the room.

He says people are ‘clever cheats’ who ‘go to extreme to find fault to get discount especially when our prices are at peak high prices.’

Manager Shawwal Khalil denies all accusations and insists his hotel is deserves its four star accreditation 

Dr Glen Pinna studied swabs taken from one of the hotel room and was disgusted to find faecal matter and intense concentrations of bacteria

Mr Khalil was also adamant that the hotel was not guilty of false advertising.

‘I argue that the words magnificent and luxurious or any other terms are open to broad interpretation,’ he said in a statement to Channel Nine.

‘Savannah holds high priority in all areas of cleanliness, Room services and general amenities,’ he said.

‘Issues do happen and they get fixed in any business.’

However, during a hidden camera investigation the reality of the rooms’ revolting conditions were unveiled.

‘Mould on the taps, on the wall fittings, the mirror wasn’t cleaned properly, it’s just really grubby,’ former hotel guest Michael told A Current Affair, after he and his family were revolted when they arrived for a recent holiday.

He was bewildered as to how the hotel could possibly be rated four stars, remarking ‘I couldn’t put a star to it.’

A for effort: At least the hotel tried to repair this bin, albeit a little haphazardly with sticky tape. However, maybe replacing the cheap plastic item would have been preferable

The hotel claims it rarely receives complaints and rooms are cleaned thoroughly.

However, the Savannah Broadbeach Resort has been bombarded with scathing reviews online.

‘We entered the smelly walkway which wreaked of garbage to the room, uhh ohh we thought,’ wrote Bianca.

‘The room was dark, dirty, dusty, mouldy and housed a disgusting foul odour.’

Eleni was horrified when her partner cut himself in the pool and the blood was left by cleaners for an extensive period of time.

‘My partner and I went for a swim in the pool where he stepped on something sharp at the bottom and cut open his toe.

‘He got out of the pool and there was plenty of blood all over the floor. When I went to tell the man at reception he didnt seem to care much.. nor did they clean the blood for over an hour!’ wrote Eleni.

Janine and Shane both separately called the hotel the worst and the dirtiest motel rooms they have ever had the displeasure of staying in.

‘Dirty and old room. In the hallway, there were empty beer bottles left for the 3 days which we stayed. Was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in,’ wrote Janine.

‘The dirtiest motel room I have ever been in. There was mould on the curtains, in the bathroom and under the surface saver on the kitchen bench tops,’ Shane wrote.

‘There were sweat stains on the lounge chairs, stains on the pillows and the carpet was disgusting.’

However, the manager insists that guests have a lovely time when they stay at the Savannah.

‘Savannah value its guests and provide best and efficient services to all it's (sic) guests to make it comfortable and enjoyable in all circumstances during their stay,’ he wrote.

‘Our staff's (sic) go out of their way to make sure their demands are fulfilled.’

However, when asked if former guest Michael would recommend staying at the hotel, he responded, ‘just don’t do it. Please, please don’t do it.’
