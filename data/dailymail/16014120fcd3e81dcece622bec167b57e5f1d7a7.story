A five-bedroom palatial pad once home to Australian recruitment queen Julia Ross has sold on Sydney's most expensive street for more than  $37 million. 

The Mediterranean-inspired home in Point Piper, in the city's east, is Sydney's highest selling home this year surpassing four other properties on the same suburb which have cracked the $30 million mark.

Listing agents Bill Malouf of LJ Hooker Double Bay and Ken Jacobs of Christies International Real listed the Wolseley Road property on Millionaire's Row for a cool $40 million last month but would not speculate whether it reached that mark. 

The Mediterranean-style home was sold bought $21 million eight years ago but sold for almost twice the price last month

The price set a nationwide record for a non waterfront home and was the highest priced sale recorded so far in 2014

Both remain  tight-lipped over the sale of the Ville del Mare, on Wolseley Road, which boasts 270 degree views of the best harbour in Australia on possibly the nation's most desirable street.

Ms Ross, who founded her own recruiting business Julia Ross recruitment in 1988 sold the ornate limestone Palazzo for close to double the $21.5 million price tag she paid for it back in 2005.

The price was the second highest paid for a house in Australia at the time, beaten only by the $28 million sale of the Altona which is also situated at Point Piper. It sold  for $52 million last year and remains Sydney's second most expensive sale.

The city's record house remains the nearby $53 million Villa Veneto  pad paid for Sydney dentist and medical innovator David Penn. 

As it stands today, the Ville de Mare captures  sweeping harbour views and keeps impeccable gardens on the grounds of the luxurious 1500 square metre property that also has five oversized ensuite bedrooms.

The three-storey home also has its own self-contained apartment on the lower level.

The estimated $37 million sale is a record for a non-waterfront sale in Australia  and follows the sale of four other properties all above $30 million this year which are all located in the same salubrious suburb.

Decked out with chandeliers, cherubs and Corinthian columns it is undoubtedly one of Sydney's most prestigious properties.

Extensive formal and informal living and dining spaces encompass a bar room and a magnificent entertainer's kitchen, while there is the very best in automated smart home technology. 

The focal point is an infinity edge pool from which you can soak up the view, with concealed outdoor speakers and professional garden lighting. 

It is the latest of five properties above $30 million to change hands in Point Piper this year including another non-waterfront home in Wentworth St in July, and the home formerly owned by Property developer and Ville de Mare neighbour Ron Medich.

He pocketed about $30 million earlier in June for his 783 square metre Piper Point property. Last week, a home belonging to former hotelier Salvatore Paino sold for more than $30 million.

Ms Ross was named at number 25 on the BRW rich list in 2013 with an estimated wealth of  $65 million. She sold half of her business in 2000 and the remaining stock in  2011.

The trophy sale sets a new record for non-waterfront real estate in Australia, eclipsing the $32.4 million paid in 2008 for the nearby mansion Craig-y-Mor

Ken Jacobs, of Christie's International, and Bill Malouf, of LJ Hooker Double Bay, confirmed the property had sold but would not disclose the price

A sales campaign for the three-storey property began in August with hopes of $40 million but it is not known how close this home got to that mark

Sydney's record house house sale remains the $53 million paid for the nearby waterfront Villa Veneto, and second highest was set last March when Altona sold for $52 million.
