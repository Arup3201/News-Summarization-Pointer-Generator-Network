The estranged wife in Britain's biggest ever divorce case has said she will not appeal after being awarded £200 million less than she wanted.

Sir Chris Hohn, son of a Jamaican motor mechanic, was ordered by a High Court Judge to hand over about a third of a £1 billion fortune to Jamie Cooper-Hohn, earlier this month.

The 49-year-old had wanted half of the money, but Judge Mrs Justice Roberts awarded her 36 per cent - £337 million - following a trial in the Family Division of the High Court in London.

Today Mrs Cooper-Hohn said she had considered appealing the ruling but decided against it.

Jamie Cooper-Hohn, 49, (pictured left) has said she does not plan to appeal the High Court decision to award her £200m less than she wanted in her divorce from Sir Chris Hohn, 48, (pictured right).

'I have chosen not to appeal this judgment, and instead focus on my passions: transforming children's lives in the developing world and raising my own children.

'I firmly believe, however, that the so-called 'special contribution' doctrine used in this case is outdated and unjust in disproportionately valuing the generation of wealth. 

'It dismisses the important contributions that those who take on the responsibility to raise children and work in less lucrative sectors make to our society. 

The award is thought to be the biggest of its kind made by a judge in England.

Legal experts say it is 'certainly' one of the biggest payouts to be pocketed by an estranged wife.

She and Sir Chris married in 1995, had four children and had been married for more than 15 years, Mrs Justice Roberts was told.

Mrs Cooper-Hohn had said the wealth had been created as a result of their 'partnership'.

But the judge concluded that Sir Chris - who was educated at a state school and studied business and accounting at Southampton University - was a 'financial genius' who had made a 'special contribution' to the creation of the couple's fortune.

Mrs Cooper-Hohn said instead of appealing the judgement she is going to return her focus to 'helping children in need across the world and raising my three daughters and son'

Mrs Cooper-Hohn had told the judge that she worked long hours on behalf of their charitable foundation - and travelled.

She said they had met when studying in the United States, at Harvard near Boston. She said both had wanted to 'make the world a better place'.

And she added today: 'Our family had three pillars at its core: work, philanthropy, and the care and nurturing of our children.

'I was primarily responsible for two of those—raising four children and, as CEO and Founder, creating one of the world's largest and most impactful foundations. 

'I saw our marriage as an equal partnership with mutual interests. That our legal system failed to acknowledge our marriage in that light and saw the woman's role as less 'special' than the husband's contribution sends the wrong message to those who choose a life of service. 

'I truly hope our legal system will evolve to have more respect for a modern definition of marital partnership.'

Sir Chris had told the judge: 'Over the long term I am an unbelievable money-maker.'

He said he was a billionaire and in the 'top 10' career investors.

But he had also told the judge that he did not 'really care about money' and said money did not bring happiness.

Sir Chris had said he had visited the Philippines aged 20, seen poor children and vowed that if he ever had enough money to help poor children he would.

He said by his mid-30s he had been in a position where he could retire and raise money for charity.
