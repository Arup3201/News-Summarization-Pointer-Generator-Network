A heartbroken father whose daughter was diagnosed with schizophrenia after trying to jump out of a second-story window at age six has described his despair in a new book.

In his memoirs 'January First,' Michael Schofield chronicles his family's experience with the devastating mental illness, which usually presents itself at least a decade later - between the ages of 18 and 22.

The Santa Clarita, California, man and his wife, Susan, were forced to hospitalise their daughter, January, on multiple occasions, fearing for their and their baby son Bohdi's lives.

The girl, who is now 10, was formally diagnosed after she tried to choke herself and jump out of her second-story bedroom window.

Schofield knew something was wrong when Jani, as they call her, was just a baby, as she rarely slept and the parents had to visually stimulate her at all times to stop her screaming.

But Jani's behaviour became increasingly disturbing as she grew older, with her even trying to harm herself and her newborn brother.

'One minute she'd be sweet and loving and then it was like a switch was flipped, and she was trying to attack Bohdi, or Susan, or me,' Schofield told Fox News.

'And then, as fast as it came, it would 
turn off again. She would act like nothing happened – there was no 
pouting, and there were times she was fine with Bodhi.'

Jani, who was also incredibly bright, with an IQ of 146, wouldn't interact with kids her own age.

She instead lived between reality and an imaginary island she called Calalini, where her 'friends' included animals and people she named after numbers.

The family visited scores of doctors who failed to diagose her, instead throwing around conditions such as autism or bipolar.

She was prescribed several medications but nothing calmed her.

It wasn't until she was in UCLA that Dr Mark DeAntonio, clinical professor and director of inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric services at Resnick Neurospsychiatric Hospital, gave Jani's illness a name.

'She was not unique, but for a child that age to have such floored psychotic symptoms with visual and auditory hallucinations – you don’t normally see that in a six-year-old,' he told Fox.

'We do have children that age in the hospital, but not for those reasons.'

Schofield said he had a mixed reaction to finally hearing his daughter's diagnosis.

'There was a brief second of happiness – finally we have a name to it – and then the reality of what it meant hit me,' he said.

'Her life expectancy is shorter, and I might outlive her – and I couldn’t deal with that.'

Now 10 years old, Jani is on a cocktail of clozapine, Thorazine and lithium, and attends almost daily therapy sessions to keep her symptoms at bay, although her hallucinations and the voices she hears will never completely disappear.

'We’ve helped educate her as to when her experiences are psychotic symptoms, how she can get her needs met, and getting her to work better with her peers,' Schofield told Fox.

'I don’t remember who I was before all 
of this, and there’s no going back. But, there are a lot of kids out 
there like Jani and no support system.'

According to the National Institute of Mental Health, schizophrenia affects about 1 per cent of Americans and is thought to be hereditary.

It’s a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder that causes people to hear voices and have hallucinations, believe other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts or plotting to harm them.

But the illness is usually diagnosed in the late teens or early 20s.

'It’s unusual to see it present itself below 12 years of age,' DeAntonio said.

Childhood schizophrenia, also known as childhood-onset schizophrenia or early-onset schizophrenia is basically the same as schizophrenia in adults, but it sets in earlier in life.

The condition is rare in children and difficult to recognise during its early phases.

Early-onset schizophrenia starts when the child is aged between 13 and 18 years, although very early-onset schizophrenia starts when the child is aged 12 years or less, as in January's case.

The psychiatric illness can have a massive impact on the child's ability to function properly.

A child with schizophrenia may have hallucinations, delusions, irrational thinking, bizarre behavior and difficulties performing everyday tasks, such as washing.

He or she may have gradual changes in behavior, for example a child who once enjoyed relationships with others may begin to become withdrawn and shy, and appear to be in a world of their own.

The child may start talking about unusual ideas and fears. They may become clingy with their parents and say things that do not make any sense.

Experts are not sure what the causes of schizophrenia are. Recent studies suggest a combination of factors, including brain changes, as well as biochemical, environmental and genetic factors may play a part.

Schizophrenia cannot be cured with modern medicine and therapies. However, it can be controlled.
