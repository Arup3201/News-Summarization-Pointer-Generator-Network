Victoria Beckham expands her fashion empire even further today, as she opens her first online shop.

Previously just a digital lookbook for her collections, VictoriaBeckham.com has been transformed into a transactable online boutique featuring her signature fashion and accessory lines as well as a bevvy of behind the scenes pictures, videos, notes and inspirational images that will delight fans of her label.

To celebrate the launch of her online shop, Victoria - who often tops the world's best-dressed lists and counts Eva Longoria, Elle MacPherson, Blake Lively and Kim Kardashian as fans of her designs - has opened up on the style rules that she lives by.

Victoria Beckham launched her first transactable website - VictoriaBeckham.com - today

The site features the new ready to wear Icon collection, with prices starting at £1050

Talking to Grazia magazine Victoria said: 'I love fashion, and I love changing my style, my hair, my make-up, and everything I have done in the past has made me what I am now.'

38-year-old Victoria has created a signature style heavy on heels, oversized accessories and sharp separates.

And while she is keen to point out that sunglasses and the right accessories can make or break an outfit, surprisingly the petite star claims that heels aren't always the only footwear to be seen in and that flats can be just as chic.

Always accessorise is another of Victoria's style mantras and she advocates dressing appropriately for the occasion .. a red carpet outfit is not practical if you are running around with the children

She also advises women to match their outfit to the occasion and ditch the bodycon when running around after the children: 'Dress appropriately - not too tight, with room to move around when carrying the kids.'

Talking about her perfect dress the mother-of-four lists hidden corsetry a demure length and a bandeau neckline as the factors in a 'love forever' dress - all which of course feature in the new Icon collection she has created for the launch of the site.

The website has been three years in 
the making, with Victoria telling Elle UK earlier this year that making it user-friendly 
enough to satisfy her was the main challenge: 'It
was so important that the concept, tone and look of it were true to me 
and my aesthetic and that the shopping experience was the very best that
it could be for my customer.

She added: 'The site will be ever evolving featuring never seen before insights into my world through the medium of film.

'I'm incredibly excited with what I have created and the unique access to the brand I am now able to offer.'

The site offers visitors the opportunity to 'Shop' or 'Look'.

The 'Look' landing page is an online scrap book featuring images and videos from the brand's latest catwalk collections as well as Victoria's own Instagram pictures from the shows and shoots.

In the 'Shop' section customers can find accessories - including the £1995 'Victoria' handbag in various colours - eyewear, denim and the diffusion Victoria Victoria Beckham line.

The new ready to wear 'Icon' dress collection is also available to buy, with prices starting at £1050 and sizes available in 6 to 14.

Victoria told Marie Claire: ‘I have been an online shopper for quite a 
long time. Since I travel so often, e-commerce can be with me wherever I
go, they can ship to wherever I'll be, so for me it's very convenient.’

She added: ‘With victoriabeckham.com I am to offer the upmost experience
in online shopping. I think people expect the best from me, and I want 
to deliver them the best. I wanted to offer a sophisticated, cool yet 
easy shopping experience for my customer.'

Beckham made her debut as a designer with a limited edition VB Rocks collection for US denim label, Rock and Republic, in 2004.

Her own brand effort first appeared 
on the catwalk four years later at New York Fashion Week and much to the
consternation of critics, was an instant success.

Since the Victoria Beckham fashion 
label, which began life as a dresses only affair, has diversified, with 
Beckham adding cheaper diffusion line, Victoria, Victoria Beckham to her
repertoire.

1. ALWAYS ACCESSORISE ... they are key.  The right bag can make any outfit

2. DRESS APPROPRIATELY ... you'll need a roomier outfit when out with the kids

3. NEVER FORGET SUNGLASSES ... a pair of shades completes any look

4. INVEST IN JEANS ... skinny, indigo denim works for day or night

5. YOU DON'T ALWAYS NEED HEELS ... flats can be just as chic
