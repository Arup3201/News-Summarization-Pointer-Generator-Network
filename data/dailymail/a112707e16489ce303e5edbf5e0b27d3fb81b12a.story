She claimed to be a Saudi princess whose pocket money of £100,000 a week arrived in London in suitcases.

So when ‘Princess’ Sara Al Amoudi, 30, befriended property developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton, they were keen for her to invest in their business.

After she said she had millions in Dubai bank accounts poised to spend on a property venture, they transferred the ownership of six luxury London flats, now worth £14million, into her name.

Yet the pair told the High Court in 
London yesterday that Miss Al Amoudi’s investment never materialised and
 that far from being a wealthy princess, she was a fraudster.

She is also alleged to have swindled banks including the HSBC.

Miss Clutterbuck and Mr Paton are 
demanding she pay them £14million for the flats and say the entire case 
hinges on whether there is any  evidence that she is who she says she 
is.

Covered in a head to toe burka, she 
arrived at court in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce with an ‘HRH’ number 
plate, accompanied by three burly minders, one of whom carried her 
handbag.

Miss Al Amoudi – once nicknamed ‘the 
vamp in the veil’ – had a previous brush with the law three years ago 
when her Swedish ex-boyfriend Patrick Ribbsaeter went on trial for 
assaulting her chauffeur after a weekend-long drink and drugs binge.

Giving evidence in Southwark Crown Court then, she also wore a full-face
 Islamic veil. In her real life, said Ribbsaeter, who was eventually 
cleared, she wore tight jeans and basques, and drank until she could 
barely walk.

According to the latest case, she 
first convinced banks that she was Saudi royalty, the daughter of 
billionaire sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi, in order to obtain huge 
loans.

Wrangle: Property tycoon Amanda Clutterbuck, pictured, and her partner Ian Paton say they transferred six properties worth millions of pounds to Sarah Al Amoudi, 30, for a nominal fee

She is then accused of using the cash
 to create the impression of fabulous wealth when she was introduced to 
Miss Clutterbuck and Mr Paton by a mutual friend.

They entered into a number of 
property deals with her without problems before they were persuaded to 
transfer six luxury properties into her name, said their counsel, Stuart
 Cakebread.

The properties included flats in Knightsbridge and Belgravia.

Mr Cakebread told judge Mrs Justice Asplin: ‘The identity of Miss Al Amoudi is a key issue in this action.

‘Her claim to be a Saudi princess and
 the daughter of Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi was a key factor 
which induced the claimants to trust her.’

However Miss Al Amoudi’s barrister, 
Jonathan Seitler, yesterday claimed that property developer Mr Paton 
kept secret from his partner Miss Clutterbuck his dealings with the 
alleged princess because he was having an affair with her.

Mr Paton replied: ‘That’s absolutely false, that’s absolute nonsense.’

The case continues.
