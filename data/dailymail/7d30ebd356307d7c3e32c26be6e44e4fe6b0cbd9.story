A middle school student armed with two butcher knives and a creepy clown mask had to be subdued by a resource officer after he stormed into his school's cafeteria.

The incident took place at West Rowan Middle School in Salisbury, North Carolina  on Tuesday morning.

Police said the student started waving one of the 12 inch butcher knives 'wildly in the air' while wearing a clown mask in the  school's cafeteria. 

Frightening: The incident took place at West Rowan Middle School in Salisbury, North Carolina

Weapon: A middle school student was armed with two butcher knifes and had one more in his book bag

School: West Rowan Middle School in Salisbury, North Carolina did not go on lock down during the incident

Other students began screaming and running away, leaving the student, who has not been named, standing with both knives in the air.

School resource officer Deputy Danny Lindley said he rushed in to subdue the 14-year-old student.

He told WBTV: 'I approached the cafeteria [where] a lot of the children were running out.

'When I first got into the cafeteria I saw a subject standing there wearing a clown mask and holding a butcher knife in his hand.

'He was not moving, he was just standing there with the knife straight out in front of me, so I went for my asp baton, which is a metal pipe.

'I decided that since he wasn't making any aggressive moves toward me that I would try and just disarm him and get him to lay the knife down, go with that approach first. 

The deputy asked the student to drop the weapon but he continued to hold it in his right hand. He then asked him two more times  to drop the knife but he did not. 

Deputy Lindley said he hit the student with a baton in his forearm three times altogether. He then placed the boy in handcuffs.

During the incident, the teenager  made 'several statements', but officials have not released information on what those statements were.

After he was hit on the arm, he fell silent and stood still while Lindley  put him against the wall and patted him down for additional weapons.

Police: Sheriff Kevin Auten was pleased that the resource officer was there and resolved it peacefully

Strange: The eighth grade student is described as a white male, and will be evaluated by mental health doctors 

Sheriff Kevin Auten said the deputy found another butcher knife in the student's book bag.

Deputy Lindley added: '[If] a person has a knife, we're basically trained that we can use up to and including deadly force.'

'I felt that since there were no other children around him and no one was in immediate danger that I would start at the lower end of the use of force continuum which would be the asp baton.

The school did not go on lock down because the threat was quickly eliminated. 

No other students or staff members were injured during the incident.

The eighth grade student involved is described as a white male. 

He was taken to the local medical center to be treated for his arm injury. He will also be evaluated by mental health professionals.

Officers said the investigation will continue once medical officials determine the type of treatment the student may require.  

Deputy Lindley added: ‘I'm glad that it turned out the way it did, no one got hurt. A lot of people got scared, but no one was physically hurt. 

'It could have been a lot worse and in the back of my mind I think, you know, I could have shot the kid, but I'm glad I didn't.'
