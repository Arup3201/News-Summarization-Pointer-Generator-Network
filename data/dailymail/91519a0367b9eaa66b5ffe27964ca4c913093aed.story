Winston Churchill was hit by a series of personal tragedies during the First World War, new research revealed today.

The future prime minister lost four close members of his family during the first few months of the 1914-1918 conflict, and a fifth near the end.

Three more cousins were badly wounded during the war, in which he served as First Lord of the Admiralty before resigning after the Gallipoli campaign.

Some of Mr Churchill’s closest friends were also killed in the Great War - including Valentine Fleming, the father of James Bond creator Ian Fleming.

Several workers from his ancestral home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, also failed to return after joining the Queen’s Own Oxfordshire Hussars.

Death:

the first family member killed on October 19, 1914 The Eton-educated 
officer served in the 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade and while on a 
reconnaissance patrol at a railway embankment near Lille he was picked 
off by a German sniper

Killed: Mr Churchill’s cousin, Captain Coulson Fellowes (left), died in October 1915 of the effects of exposure, ten months after being injured in the trenches. And Mr Churchill’s uncle Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Wilson (right) was shot in the head while leading his troops at Zillebeke near Ypres on November 6, 1914

The true scale of the losses relating to him has been uncovered for an exhibition at Blenheim Palace, called ‘A Great Estate at War - Land, Sea and Air’.

Blenheim’s education officer Karen Wiseman said: ‘When I started doing the research we did not know an awful lot about the extent of the heavy losses that befell Winston Churchill’s close family and friends during World War One.

‘But it became clear that he suffered greatly in the war. He was very close to his cousins as well as friends who worked in the estate.

‘He must have had such great resolve to go on and do the things he did.’

Mr Churchill’s maternal cousin, Captain Norman Leslie, was the first family member killed on October 19, 1914.

The Eton-educated officer served in 
the 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade and while on a reconnaissance patrol at a
 railway embankment near Lille he was picked off by a German sniper.

The
 next relation killed was Churchill’s uncle Gordon Wilson, a Lieutenant 
Colonel in the Royal Horse Guards, who was shot in the head while 
leading his troops at Zillebeke near Ypres on November 6, 1914.

Badly wounded: Henry John Innes-Ker (left), the 8th Duke of Roxburghe, was shot in the groin area, while Oscar Guest (right), who served in the Royal Flying Corps, had a spectacular escape from death in December 1915. He fell unconscious at 2,000ft after being hit in the back, the ear and in the elbow by a bullets from a German plane

His ancestral home: Several workers from his ancestral home, Blenheim Palace also failed to return after being called up to the Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars

Another
 cousin, Captain Coulson Fellowes, died in October 1915 of the effects 
of exposure, ten months after being injured in the trenches.

Winston Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911 and held this position as the First World War began.

He pushed the idea of attacking Gallipoli in 1915, which turned out to be one of Britain's most disastrous military campaigns.

It had been intended to clear a relief route to Russia by securing a route from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.

But fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster.

The campaign cost the lives of 36,000 Commonwealth servicemen - and Churchill became a scapegoat for it, later resigning.

He then returned to the Army and was appointed Lieutenant Colonel, commanding the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. He led by example, often venturing into No Man’s Land on night patrol.

During a visit to the frontline with his first cousin Charles Spencer-Churchill, the 9th Duke of Marlborough, he had his own lucky escape.

A large piece of shrapnel fell between the two men. They were unharmed in the blast and each took a shell fragment to remind them of their lucky escape.

Mr Churchill's stint in the trenches came to an end shortly after when, because of high casualties, his battalion was merged with another and he was told to return to Britain and resume his work in the Commons.

Also
 in October 1915, Lieutenant Wilfred Sheridan, the husband of Mr
Churchill’s cousin Clare Sheridan, was killed while leading his men at 
the Battle of Loos.

The fifth loss relating to Mr Churchill was Lady Alexandra Phyllis Hamilton, a second cousin of Churchill.

On
 October 11, 1918, she was on the Irish Steamer RMS Leinster when it was
 hit by a German UB-128 submarine, when sailing out of Dublin Bay and 
drowned.

Three more of Mr Churchill’s cousins were badly wounded in the Great War.

Henry
 John Innes-Ker, the 8th Duke of Roxburghe, and his brother Captain Lord
 Alistair Innes-Ker, were shot in the groin area and head respectively.

The
 third was the colourful Oscar Guest, who served in the Royal Flying 
Corps, and had a spectacular escape from death in December 1915.

Mr Guest’s never-before-seen war diaries make up part of the exhibition.

The
 so-called ‘flying cousin’ fell unconscious at 2,000ft after being hit 
in the back, the ear and in the elbow by a bullets from a German Fokker 
plane.

He wrote: ‘After a while I felt like fainting so throttled down and went to sleep.

‘Bell-Irving (co-pilot) did the same and the machine wobbled down and crashed in a ploughed field cutting our heads a bit.’

The men came to and managed to find their way back to friendly lines. Mr Guest added: ‘Altogether a most wonderful escape.’

Aerial
 warfare was a new concept in the First World War. Bi-planes were used 
at first for reconnaissance purposes, until it was found they could also
 drop bombs on the enemy.

Mr Guest wrote of his dislike of bombing raids which he thought were dishonourable.

Mrs
 Wiseman said: ‘Reading the diary it is clear the airmen started off 
being quite friendly towards the German pilots and they would wave at 
each other.

‘When big guns 
were fitted to the back and sides of the planes that’s when it started 
getting bloody and the men began to harden.

‘By the end of the war all the men were ready to shoot to kill.’

Part of the exhibition at Blenheim focuses on the estate workers who served in the Queen's Own Oxford Hussars, who were sent to war by Mr Churchill.

Mrs Wiseman said: ‘They were cavalry and the expectation that the army would break through and the war would be over within weeks.

‘But the hussars were used to plug the gaps along the frontline and were at all the major hotspots of the war like the Somme and Ypres. They saw a lot of action.

‘As well as losing members of his family, Churchill also lost some great friends who were in the hussars.’

The exhibition at Blenheim Palace, located in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, runs until July 1.
