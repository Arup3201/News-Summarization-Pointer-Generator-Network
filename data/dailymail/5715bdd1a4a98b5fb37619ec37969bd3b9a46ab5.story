Angela Merkel flatly rejected calls yesterday to write off any more Greek debts amid mounting tensions within Europe over the country's multi-billion euro bailout programme.

The German Chancellor's comments dealt a blow to the new Greek government, which is pushing for a compromise on the tough austerity conditions with which it must comply.

She told the Hamburger Abendblatt: 'I do not envisage fresh debt cancellation. There has already been voluntary debt forgiveness by private creditors, banks have already slashed billions from Greece's debt.'

However, commentators said her tough stance is aimed at German taxpayers worried about European insatiability, and that Greece will ultimately be allowed to repay the debt over a longer period.

Vicky Pryce, chief economic advisor for consultancy firm CEBR, said other countries including Spain, where thousands protested against austerity yesterday, could win similar concessions.

Greece's new government has begun to roll back some of the conditions demanded by the EU and International Monetary Fund in return for a 240 billion euro bailout in 2010. 

The country says it will negotiate to halve the debt. It owes more than 315 billion euros, an EU record.
