Famous graffiti artist Banksy has become so popular in New York that many locals are flocking to get tattoos inspired by his work as the artist's residency in the Big Apple comes to an end. 

Tattooist Miykey Kwasnik, 39, from New York Hardcore Tattoo, Manhattan, said he has been swamped with Banksy requests during the artist's month-long residency.

The illusive graffiti artist, originally from Bristol, has been posting photos of his New York City works every day for the last month.

Popular requests include the robot spray painting a barcode which featured on a Coney Island wall, and an image of a cleaner wiping away quote ‘What we do in life echoes in Eternity’ from the movie Gladiator, which has appeared in Queens.

The most popular are the timeless Banksy images of a girl floating away on balloon and a soldier throwing flowers.

During his New York residency, several of his pieces have been quickly defaced by other taggers or business owners.

Mr Kwasnik, who has worked as a tattooist for the past five years, said: ‘I've been doing Banksy tattoos for over a year now.

‘Most people really enjoy the positive message behind the imagery. 

‘People
 also mention how it's like an eye-opener for the general public to 
start admiring all the available art around them and to treat it the 
same as what you find in galleries. Art is everywhere.

‘I have been following Banksy for 
quite some time now. I'm a big admirer of street art and have been since
 I grew up around trains covered in graffiti.

Keeping it true: Kwasnik has found that most people who request a Banksy-inspired tattoo want to keep it true to the artist's original work

‘Quite
 a few of my clients and friends are street artists from all over the 
world. Generally those who get tattoos of street artists, like Banksy, 
keep their dedication true to the artists' piece.

‘I'm a big fan of Banksy's work and message -- he is a true visionary and I'd shake his hand if I ever have the honour of meeting this person. 

‘I hear a lot of negativity and 
jealously projected at the Banksy project, but they all understand it's 
making a difference. Never thought I'd see the day that what was once 
considered vandalism is now admired as art and categorised as “street 
art”. Get out and enjoy it.’

Banksy finished his self-imposed stay with a massive charity donation.

The elusive artist took a painting from a charity shop and added a seated Nazi officer before returning it to the same shop and allowing them to auction it off for a six-figure sum. 

HousingWorks, a New York-based charity that helps the homeless and those living with HIV/Aids, sold the painting through an online auction house and after two days of open bidding, the final price came to $615,000.

'It’s such a great gesture, what he did today is really special. He may be controversial, but there is no controversy in the fact that it goes to something good,' the charity's spokeswoman Rebecca Edmondson said at the time.

Meanwhile, two would-be thieves were arrested after they were caught trying to steal balloons in the shape of the artist’s name attached to a seemingly abandoned building in Queens.

By the time that fans had gathered by the seemingly abandoned building in Queens where Banksy attached an inflatable balloon in the shape of his name, there were two men who had gotten a ladder and were in the process of cutting it down.
