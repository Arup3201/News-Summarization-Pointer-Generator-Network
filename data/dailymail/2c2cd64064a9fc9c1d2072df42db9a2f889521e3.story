George Osborne has found an unlikely ally in his party’s plans to reform the welfare system.

Deirdre Kelly, who found fame as White Dee in the Channel 4 series Benefits Street, yesterday agreed the amount given in state handouts needs to ‘tighten up’.

The single mother-of-two admitted she used to receive £212 a week to live on – and had more money in her pocket than some of her friends with full-time jobs.

Deirdre Kelly, who found fame as White Dee in the Channel 4 series Benefits Street, yesterday agreed the amount given in state handouts needs to ‘tighten up’ after revealing she used to receive £212 a week

Miss Kelly, 43, who has not claimed benefits since May, was convicted of stealing more than £13,000 of taxpayers’ money meant for vulnerable residents while working at a local council.

Since appearing on the documentary, she has gone on to star in reality TV shows and has been conducting numerous interviews about the welfare system while at the Conservative Party conference.

When asked during an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday about the problem of people on welfare who found it was not worth their while to work, she said: ‘When I was part of the benefit system it worked out that I would have at the end of a week £212 – yeah, that’s cash.

‘I don’t know any of my friends who work 40-plus hours a week who have £212 in their pocket to spare. But obviously that’s not my fault. It’s the Government who decides how much the individual has to live on. So it does need tightening up.’

Asked what she thought of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and the Coalition’s reforms so far, she replied: ‘I don’t make much of it. He’s trying to get the taxpayers on side.’ 

Despite previously declaring herself a Labour supporter, she said of the party’s welfare policies: ‘I’ve not heard Labour say anything actually.’

Miss Kelly angered taxpayers earlier this year after saying she would continue claiming until the Government stopped her.

The Department for Work and Pensions met with her ‘showbiz agent’ in May after David Cameron warned she could lose her benefits if it was found she was earning a lot from her promotional work.

She received more than £200 a week from a combination of employment and support allowance – formerly known as incapacity benefit – child tax credit and child benefit, plus £500 a month in housing benefit.

A court heard she had worked as an administration assistant for her local authority in Birmingham for seven years but began stealing cash and cheques from a safe, while manipulating paperwork in an attempt to cover her tracks. She was caught after an internal audit.

Miss Kelly claimed in court she had used the cash to feed her partner’s crack cocaine habit and pay household bills.

The judge spared her a jail sentence only because she had no previous convictions and to ensure her children were not put in care.

She received a suspended sentence and was ordered to carry out 220 hours of unpaid work.

At the conference, Miss Kelly told a fringe event she was considering voting Ukip in next year’s election. She added: ‘[Nigel] Farage doesn’t seem to be doing a bad job.’

When it was pointed out that Ukip leader Mr Farage had not set out a full set of welfare policies, she said: ‘He’s been clever then hasn’t he? He’s leaving it to everyone else to dig a big hole for themselves and then he’ll swoop in and take over.’

Miss Kelly said it had been a ‘privilege’ to speak at the event on Monday night, but accused one audience member of being ‘downright rude’ after he asked her: ‘Why should people like you get fags and booze on the State?’
