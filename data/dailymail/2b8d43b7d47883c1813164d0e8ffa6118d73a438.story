A man who found a giant Hula Hoop while snacking on a bag of crisps and put the snack on eBay has sold it for £712.

Musician Stuart Hampton, 31, from Darnhill in Greater Manchester decided to sell the three-inch salt and vinegar flavoured crisp on eBay, believing it to be the longest in the world.

He said: “It blew my mind when I found it, it was in perfect condition. 

The three-inch salt and vinegar flavoured Hula Hoop attracted an impressive 32 bids on eBay - selling for £712

 “I didn’t eat it because I thought it would be more fun showing it to the world.”

He put it on the website last week and described it as 'the world's longest hula hoop'.

Bids began at just £1 and then shot to £140 overnight, with the final bid, from Heywood, in Greater Manchester, coming in just before the online auction ended.

In total there were 32 bids on the snack before bidding ended.

Under item condition, Mr Hampton honestly put 'used' and said in the item description: 'Well, it's out of the packet, but I will put it in a sealed plastic bag for you.'

Stuart Hampton was delighted when it sold and has said he will use the money to help found a commune

Another item for sale on Mr Hampton's eBay page is 'Love' - with proceeds going towards his dream, Freeriver

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Mr Hampton said: 'I can't be sure whether it's a genuine bid or not.

'Legally the bidder has to pay up.

'If he or she doesn't pay within the next few days I will get in touch with the other people and sell it to one of them.'

In response to the recent discovery of an even longer five-inch find by four-year-old Vincent Green from Edinburgh, Stuart said: 'I've heard that the owner of that one has eaten it, which makes mine definitely the biggest.

'It is all just a bit of a laugh though to be honest.

'I was walking down the street just cracking up laughing about it but if I do get the money it is definitely going towards my commune.' 

Mr Hampton has even set up a website to help fund his lifelong ambition, which he has already named the Freeriver Community.

The website states: 'Freeriver is a space that will hold a spiritual and peaceful intention. It will be very free in nature with no set ideas,

'Instead people will be free to find their own way and cultivate a way of being that feels right for them. 

'All practices will be possible and explored. Things such as Yoga, Meditation, healthy eating with a vegan diet, singing, dancing, being creative, having fun, exploring philosophies and texts, discussions, time in nature, making music and daydreaming will all be welcome.'

Other items for sale on Mr Hampton's eBay account include 'Love' for £5, in which he promises he will 'sit quietly somewhere and send you "good vibes" and love'. 

The lucky bidder will also receive a Love heart email.
