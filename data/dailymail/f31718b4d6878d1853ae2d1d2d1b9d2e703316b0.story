He is familiar to viewers of Watchdog as one half of the motorbike-riding team of investigators who chase down unscrupulous tradesmen and bring them to justice.

But Dan Penteado, who co-hosts the Rogue Traders part of the programme with presenter Matt Allwright, ended up as a wanted man himself this week.

The 40-year-old has been accused of pocketing more than £24,000 in benefits that he wasn’t entitled to while he worked for the BBC.

Hoewever, he denies and wrongdoing and says they whole thing is a 'misunderstanding'.

Penteado, from Bournemouth, failed to respond to letters of inquiry sent to him by Bournemouth Council.

As a result he was sent a court 
summons to appear before magistrates on Wednesday to answer several 
charges of fraud – but he failed to show up and a warrant was issued for his arrest.

Yesterday, however, police said the warrant was no longer outstanding.

It is understood Penteado got in contact with officers and he has been bailed to appear in court at a later date.

He told The Mirror: 'It’s all a misunderstanding that’s causing a lot of grief for my family.

'There is no arrest warrant. I’ve been to the police station and I’ve not been arrested.'

Penteado was understood to be facing 10 charges of benefit fraud from 2008 to 2012 but has not yet been formally charged.

The offences relate to Penteado allegedly failing to disclose a bank account his wages were paid into and failing to declare a change of circumstances after being hired by the BBC.

Dorset Police said they were not involved in the case and that it was a matter for Bournemouth Borough Council. A spokeswoman for the council would not comment.

Portuguese-born Penteado started working with Mr Allwright in 2001.

In the last series of Watchdog, the pair confronted eight business owners who they felt were ripping off the public.
