A nautical-themed, luxury hotel featuring a vast copper hull sweeping through the centre of the building has been opened on London’s South Bank.

The Mondrian London has been created at the iconic Sea Containers House, a former office block building.

The hotel, which sits between the Oxo Tower and Blackfriars bridge, has 359 guestrooms and suites and opened its doors to the public on Tuesday.

Sea Containers House was originally designed as a hotel by the celebrated American architect and designer Warren Platner in the 1970s. However, a world recession meant the idea was shelved and it became an office block instead. It has now been transformed into a hotel by the US-based Morgans Hotel Group

Designed by interior designer Tom Dixon, the Mondrian London features a rooftop bar, an expansive restaurant with private dining rooms, a maritime inspired 56-seat cinema and an a spa.

There will also be a cocktail bar, called the Dandelyan, which has been made from green marble, and which offers views out over the Thames.

The hotel claims: ‘Dandelyan will serve both innovative cocktails and refined interpretations of the classics, taking inspiration from the botanical wilds of the British countryside and around the world.’

Almost all of the hotel’s rooms offer river views or panoramic city views.

The mini bars in each room will also offer bespoke, pre-packaged Dandelyan cocktails.

At weekends the Curzon cinema chain will take over the hotel’s screen room to show films for both hotel guests and the public.

The hotel will also feature meeting rooms and event spaces with state-of-the-art audio, video and telecommunications technology.

The ground floor of the Mondrian London also has an exclusive art gallery, which will host book launches and exhibitions.

Mr Dixon said of the hotel: ‘Our proposal was really about trying to find the best of America and the best of Britain and applying them in one space.

‘The more we developed that narrative, the more fun we had, and it justified the idea of an American hotel in London.

‘Our challenge was to find a way of giving it a broad appeal while also creating a boutique hotel.

Designer Tom Dixon said the hotel 'was really about trying to find the best of America and the best of Britain and applying them in one space'

‘In American hotels you don’t spend so much time in your room – the important thing is the lobby, the restaurant, the lounge and rooftop bar. 

'It’s about having informal meetings and then living it up until late at night, which is what this hotel will be like.

‘British hotels traditionally have had a very calm existence in the lobby, with afternoon tea and butler service. But here huge amounts of effort are going into getting those communal spaces right.

‘The building is a bit like ship. We’ve emphasised this by mucking about with the top line of the building to make it more like a cruise liner. It feels like a transatlantic liner that’s just docked.’
