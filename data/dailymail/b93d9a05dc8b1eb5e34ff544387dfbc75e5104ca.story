Parents of soldiers killed in Afghanistan are 'furious' that they have been excluded from a memorial service - while politicians and VIPs are expected to pack the event.

The service, set to be held at St Paul's Cathedral two days before Mothering Sunday, will remember the 453 servicemen killed and thousands injured during the 13-year conflict.

But just 906 tickets have been dished out and only the spouses of fallen soldiers have been invited along with a 'plus one' leaving hundreds of grieving parents disappointed.

Jacquie McDonald, 53, from Edinburgh, who lost her son Sean, 26, in 2010 after he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED), said she feels as though parents have been 'cast aside'.

Sean had been married for 18 months, but Mrs McDonald has never had a close relationship with his wife.

'It's so insensitive. My son made the ultimate sacrifice and I should be able to honour his memory,' said Mrs McDonald.

'People can have several partners, but they will only ever have one mother.

'We are the ones who walked the floor with them for hours when they cried and wiped their knees when they fell.

'It's as if the parents have been cast aside.'

Sean had selflessly gone back to help a comrade when the device exploded, killing him instantly.

Sergeant Simon Valentine's mother Carol, 56, (pictured together) said she is 'astonished' by the decision as the service falls just before Mother's Day

'As a parent nothing can prepare you for your child dying before you - and nothing can prepare you for being denied an invitation when there is an opportunity to remember them,' said his mother.

'His wife may receive an invitation, but as we haven't seen each other in years, it's highly unlikely she'll ask me to be her plus one.'

Mrs McDonald has been in contact with other bereaved parents who have found themselves in the same situation since the service was announced by David Cameron on Wednesday.

They are now calling on the Ministry of Justice to remember mothers and fathers.

Janette Binnie, from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, whose son Sean was killed in Helmand Province in 2009, said she feels as though parents are being 'alienated'.

'It's not right – I think it should be the wife or husband and parents who attend,' she said.

'It's humiliating and degrading not being given the chance to pay tribute to your own son.

'I don't mean to sound selfish, but Sean was my only child. I carried him for nine months, brought him up and nurtured him. This is alienating parents.'

Acting Sergeant Sean Binnie's legal next of kin is wife Amanda, who married the soldier just six months before he was killed in action with 3 Scots, the Black Watch.

As Sean, 22, was married, it is Amanda who will be invited to the 2,000-capacity commemoration.

But his parents Janette, 47, and Allan, 45, who no longer have a close relationship with their son's widow, won't be issued with tickets.

Sean was killed during a firefight with insurgents near Musa Qala, where he was serving as part of the Battle Group mentoring the Afghan National Army.

He was buried near his family's home in Northern Ireland, making it difficult for his Scottish family to visit the grave.

Last week, Mrs Binnie penned a letter to the Prime Minister, calling for parents to be added to the memorial service guest list.

She is being supported by Caroline Whitaker, whose son, Sergeant Gareth Thursby, was shot by a rogue Afghan policeman just two years ago.

Gareth, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, had been married for seven years, but Mrs Whitaker's relationship with her son's wife is not as strong as it used to be.

'It's not an issue with the partners. It's the MOD's lack of compassion for parents who have lost their children,' said Mrs Whitaker.

'What annoys me more than anything else is that there will be 453 next of kin and one other, the rest will be dignitaries who never met our children.

'Ex-partners can move on, but parents can't. I have had a hole in my heart ever since he died.'

Gareth, who was 29 when he died, joined the Army aged just 16.

He served with the Yorkshire Regiment, who have been very inclusive of Caroline so far.

'It's bizarre that a local regiment could be so supportive, but as soon as there's a national event, I'm left out. I effectively gave my son to the forces,' said his mother.

'I don't want anybody to forget my son - or where he came from. That's why it's so important for parents, especially mums, to be able to attend these types of events.'

Diane Bell, 61 from Manchester, whose son Corporal Ivano Violino, 29 was killed in a convoy, which hit an IED in September 2007, feels the same way,

'It is disgusting, the way we have been treated. He had only been married for 12 weeks.

'He had twins from a previous relationship and she can't attend either. I have no relationship with his current partner, so there is no way I could get a ticket from her.

'I feel it is rubbing salt in the wounds and I am willing to stand outside the service and make my feelings known. We wouldn't have the best army in the world without us mothers, David Cameron is a disgrace.'

Sergeant Simon Valentine's mother Carol, 56, said she is 'astonished' by the decision as the service falls just before Mother's Day.

'It was the same situation when the list of names of soldiers was unveiled at the Arboretum in Staffordshire,' she said.

'I wasn't issued with an invite, I had to fight for one.

'But it shouldn't be this way. The fact that the memorial service next month falls just days before Mother's Day and mothers are being denied access astonishes me.'

Simon, of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, married just a few years before he stepped on an IED while on patrol in 2009.

The Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, senior politicians, military chiefs and veterans of the campaign have all been handed tickets.

Representatives of the Afghan nation will also be present, together with leaders of world faiths.

Mothers who have not been granted entry into the service are expected to demonstrate outside St Paul's Cathedral during the ceremony.

A spoksperson for the Ministry of Defence said: 'This service is intended to honour the contribution of all those who served in Afghanistan from 2001, whether the 100,000 military personnel or the civilians that worked there.

'Unavoidably, limited capacity at St Paul's means we are unable to include everyone who would wish to attend but by reserving half of the congregation places we are ensuring that two people with close ties to anyone who lost their life in Afghanistan can attend.

'The rest of the congregation will be made up of Armed Forces personnel and civilians who served in Afghanistan, veterans, international partners and supporting organisations.'
