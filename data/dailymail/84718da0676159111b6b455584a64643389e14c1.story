A stay-at-home mother-of-two has told how she is able to raise her family on an income of $14,000.

Danielle Wagasky, 28, from Las Vegas, Nevada, was forced to cut back when her husband took a break from the Army to go back to school.

With just his living allowance to survive on, she set about mastering the art of frugal living, teaching herself how to cook, learning how to sew and avoiding impulse shopping sprees.

Thanks to her efforts and some very savvy saving, the couple now own a home with no mortgage after paying $28,000 cash for a house without a kitchen. They own and operate two cars and have no credit card debt.

'I had to learn to change the way I was 
spending, in order for my family to save money and live a healthier 
life,' Mrs Wagasky explains on her blog Blissful and Domestic, which is 
packed full of money-saving tips.

One of the first things that she did was go to a thrift store and buy a $7 bread maker. 'It’s so good and it saves a lot of money,' she told Business Insider.

And every cent counts because the 
Wagaskys get by on a $400 a month grocery budget. They are members of a food co-op, and they pay cash in grocery stores to ensure that they don't go over their allowance.

'Once that $400 is gone, it is gone. There are no extra shopping trips made because there is no more money,' she writes.

As well as her breadmaker Mrs Wagasky's freezer is also her best friend.

She freezes baked goods, vegetables and fruits along with dairy products such as cheese, butter and yogurt.

'I am able to freeze about 8 gallons of 
milk each month.They sit at the bottom of my freezer and we thaw them 
out when we need them,' she explains.

Her kitchen is stuffed full of cookbooks which allow her to rustle up meals from scratch.

Their most impressive saving, though, was the bargain price they paid for their home. Determined not to have a mortgage, they saved $30,000 with a plan to buy a cheap foreclosure.

They were in luck when they found a 
home for just $28,000, and spent the remaining $2,000 installing wood 
flooring and a kitchen that the property had been lacking.

But before her husband, Jason, 31, left the Army, Mrs Wagasky had already started cutting back.

In 2008 when he served his second 
deployment in Iraq. she was left in charge of the family finances and 
she became determined to save $30,000 to put down a downpayment on their
home by the time he returned.

'I never paid anything growing up - I 
was kind of spoiled. And then, all of a sudden, I had to do all the 
bills. It was tough,' she said.

But everything changed when her husband 
told her to read America's Cheapest Family Gets You Right on the Money: 
Your Guide to Living Better, Spending Less, and Cashing in on Your 
Dreams.

The book is an account by Steve and Annette Economides, who feed their family of seven on just $350 a month.

It was the first time Mrs Wagasky had 
ever heard of once-a-month grocery shopping, which changed her approach 
to buying food for her family of four.

'I changed the way I was grocery shopping and started working my way up,'she recalled.

She also gained insight into how much money is wasted when things aren't budgeted.

'Everything must be budgeted. From 
family outings, to toiletries to clothes purchases. It must be 
budgeted,' Mrs Wagasky wrote last June.

She cancelled cable TV and signed up to 
Netflix, so her two children aged six and eight had some form of  
entertainment. The family also uses a simple antennae to pick up basic 
cable channels.

Everything in the home is either handmade or second-hand and she swears by a home-made laundry detergent recipe.

Today they have have barely any credit card debt, no car loan payments and no mortgage.

They do have a credit card, but only use it for emergencies, paying back the balance fast by working repayments into their monthly budget.

'We recently had some medical bills we had to pay, and we were able to take our savings and pay those down as fast as we could,' Mrs Wagasky told Business Insider.

Another means of cutting back was fuel for their two cars (both paid for in cash, like their home). The couple only fill the tanks once a month by carefully planning each outing to make the most of the gas used.

'We don't go just for an hour, we stay and visit and even run errands that may be close to where we have family,' Mrs Wagasky said.

'We try to remember that when the gas is gone... it is gone.'
