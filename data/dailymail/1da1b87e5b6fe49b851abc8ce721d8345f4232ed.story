It’s that time of year again when companies try to dupe the public with their April Fools gags.

And MailOnline has scoured the web to round up the best pranks in the world of technology so you don't have to.

This year has seen the likes of Samsung offering pigeon-powered Wi-Fi, Microsoft’s smart paperclip, Ocado's 42-inch tablet, and wearable tech pants among other gems.

Google's AutoAwesome April Fool's involved David Hasselhoff, pictured, automatically photobombing people's images on Google+. The firm promised users the Hoff would make an appearance when a photo was uploaded, if there was enough space for him, and the Knight Rider star had made 100 poses for the project

Virgin Active got involved with its 
own range of wearables, called Smarty Pants, that count how many bum 
clenches the wearer performs. 

Bathstore claimed it was launching the
 first ‘dedicated selfie mirror’, called the Mirrorgram, complete with a
 flash, time delay setting, Wi-Fi connectivity and Instagram-style 
filters.

Morphsuits unveiled the HollowMan suit that promised to make the wearer invisble.

And Wuaki.tv 
promised users of its Wuakicast device they could take over any screen, 
including the adverts in Piccadilly Circus, and 
videos would ‘follow’ users from screen to screen.

Google released a host of April Fools, including a Pokemon version of maps and an Emoji translate tool, but the top one was an update to its AutoAwesome feature on Google+.

AutoAwesome photobombing claimed to add images of celebrities to photos automatically when they were uploaded to the social network.

AutoAwesome is a real feature that automatically turns photos into GIFs and videos, but the new, fake tool gave users a photobomb option.

The tech giant said it had teamed up with David Hasselhoff and when users uploaded a new self-portrait, or a group photo with friends, the Hoff would make a surprise appearance.

In a tongue-in-cheek interview with the MailOnline, the Hoff said: ‘I’ve always wanted the opportunity to please the fans that write to me every day and Google gave me a solution. This is a great opportunity to hit the world all at once.

In a tongue-in-cheek interview with the MailOnline, the Hoff said: 'I've always wanted the opportunity to please the fans that write to me every day. I get stopped every 10 seconds for a photo. This is my opportunity to take a photo with everybody in the entire world'

Tesco got involved with April Fools' Day with an advert for its Cudl tablet, dubbed 'world's first tablet made-for-two,' pictured. It featured two seven-inch tablets connected together with a 'coupling tether'. Tesco claimed its Cudl was the best thing for relationships 'since the Finest Dinner-for-Two deal'

‘I get stopped every 10 seconds for a photo and I always want photos with my fans because I know how much it means to them. It means a lot to me too!

‘This is my opportunity to take a photo with everybody in the entire world.’

The Hoff added he had made at least a hundred poses for the project, and thought his Knight Rider pose was the funniest.

Microsoft announced the SmartClippy - a smart paperclip inspired by the Clippy help tool on Windows XP, pictured

When asked why he thinks people love him so much, Hasselhoff admitted: ‘Obviously because of my chest hair! Live the life you love, love the life you live. KITT, pick me up buddy. See you on Google+!’

Microsoft announced the SmartClippy - a smart paperclip inspired by the Clippy help tool on Windows XP – which the firm said ‘comes in a range of sizes and colours and easy to integrate into existing accessories'.

It even included a quote from the paperclip: ‘Microsoft announced the date for the end of Windows XP support back in 2007, so I’ve had a lot of time to plan my next move.

'And now I’m excited to finally announce the next chapter in my life. I’m going back to basics and doing what paper clips like me are born to do: Attach things to other things.’

Meanwhile Samsung announced the start of a pilot scheme in central London to improve internet access in public squares and parks.

In a 'revolutionary move', the company claimed it was ‘harnessing the power of pigeons to create temporary, mobile Wi-Fi cover. ‘

Dubbed ‘Fli-Fy’, the technology would see micro-router packs attached to London pigeons and in ‘tests’ where more than 50 birds had gathered together, the firm said it would provide a signal strength exceeding 4G. 

Tesco got involved with April Fools' Day with an advert for its Cudl tablet, dubbed ‘world's first tablet made-for-two.’

Elsewhere, online supermarket Ocado announced it was launching a 42-inch tablet called the sLablet, pictured, complete with an hour's battery life, after 19 hours of charge, and a strap mount system that let users wear it around their neck

The Cudl, a parody successor to its Hudl tablet, is based on the idea couples are spending up to a third more time on their devices than with each other.

It featured two seven-inch tablets connected together with a ‘coupling tether’, which used ‘springback technology’ to force couples to spend more time together.

Tesco claimed its Cudl is the best thing for relationships ‘since the Finest Dinner-for-Two deal’.

Elsewhere, online supermarket Ocado announced it was launching a 42-inch tablet called the sLablet complete with an hour's battery life, after 19 hours of charge, and a strap mount system that let users wear it around their neck.

Ryan Lipowitz, Head of Technological Innovational-Innovations at Ocado Technology said: ‘We found that 80 per cent of the time, 40 per cent of people needed a device that had 120 per cent the power of desktop, 12 per cent of the time.

Once you hold one in your arms you will understand what an incredible advancement this is, delivering all-lunch battery life in the biggest full-sized tablet in the world.’
