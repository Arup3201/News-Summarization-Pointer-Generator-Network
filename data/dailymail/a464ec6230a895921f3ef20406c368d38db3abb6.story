Gordon Higinbotham, 42, says he let escorts work from his Hull council house and took a share of the proceeds in exchange for protecting them

An unemployed father-of-four has admitted helping run an escort agency from his taxpayer-funded house.

Tattooed Gordon Higinbotham, 42, who appeared in the controversial TV show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole, says he would provide protection for escort girls as they entertained clients at his council house in Hull, East Yorkshire.

Humberside police are now investigating claims he took a quarter of the women's profits in exchange for letting them meet clients at his three-bedroom home while he sat in an adjoining room.

Mr Higinbotham, who has a foot-long tattoo of Adolf Hitler on his back and a picture of the Ku Klux Klan on his stomach, told a journalist he housed escorts at his house over a period of several years, despite claiming benefits for most of his adult life. 

He said: 'The girls used to see clients in my house and I sat next door to make sure they didn't get hurt.

'I did it on and off for a few years and I did the advertising just to help out.  My aim wasn't to make money off it, I wanted to protect the girls. 

'If they earned £40, I would receive £10 of that for my protection.'

Mr Higinbotham placed advertisements for the escort agency, called Kaz For Others, in his local paper, boasting of services including 'Feet and Secret Fantasies', 'Bi Couple, male and female' and 'Mark, male escort'.

The Hull Daily Mail said its records showed an account in his name had placed more than 100 advertisements costing nearly £400 in the paper since August 2011.

Mr Higinbotham, who is a grandfather, said he began doing it after he met some escort girls in his local supermarket and they told him they were having problems with clients.

He said: 'They were extremely upset - their clients were hurting them - so I decided to let them use my house.

'It just a little bit of money - nothing major.'

But he insisted he was no longer involved, and later said he had had 'nothing to do with' the business beyond taking out adverts and providing his house for the escort service to take place in.

Mr Higinbotham became notorious after he appeared in the Channel 5 Benefits Britain documentary earlier this month, saying: 'I like anyone as long as they're English.'

He was also filmed telling his daughter and her husband he would pay them if they voted for UKIP in May’s European elections.

After the show was broadcast he claimed he and his family had been wrongly portrayed as 'racist morons'  - though Channel 5 said Mr Higinbotham's views had been 'faithfully reported' - and said they had received death threats, leaving them frightened to leave the house.

In January 2009 the skinhead was given a two-year antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) for distributing material that could incite racial hatred, and he was also banned from showing off his 15 racist tattoos in public.

A year earlier, he was caught on CCTV sticking far-right messages on shop windows, blocks of flats and public places.

Today, spokesmen for both Hull City Council and Humberside Police said they were investigating allegations Mr Higinbotham had allowed escort services to operate in his home. 

A spokesman for the police said: 'Humberside Police have been made aware of the issue and will be looking into this.'

Phil Webster, cabinet member at Hull City Council, said: 'We will now investigate Gordon Higinbotham and the benefits he has claimed.

'If he is found to have breached his contract with a council-owned house, he could be evicted.'
