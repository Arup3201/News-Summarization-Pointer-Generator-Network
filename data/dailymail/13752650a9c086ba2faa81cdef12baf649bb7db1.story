The Third World conditions experienced by passengers at Gatwick airport last Christmas were foreseeable and should be a ‘wake-up call’ to other airports, a report warns today.

The report paints a shocking picture of the chaos at Gatwick - with just one functioning but ‘disgusting’ toilet shared by thousands and a lack of food and water for stranded passengers.

More than 11,000 travellers were hit by delays and 72 flight cancellations - with easyJet worst affected - on December 24 after flooding caused a power failure at the West Sussex airport.

In a scathing report, the watchdog said airport bosses needed to ¿get a grip¿ to ensure more passengers are never again failed by poor and inadequate contingency planning.

The failure also knocked out flight-information, baggage check-in and retrieval system - which meant that even those who wanted to leave could not get their bags back in order to do so.

The flooding fiasco should be ‘a wake-up call for airports across the UK’ in tackling foreseeable disruption’, the MPs said.

More effort should also be made to ensure passengers know and receive reimbursement and compensation in line with their consumer rights.

A Gatwick spokesman apologised at the time to passengers saying anti-flood work was in hand but the weather conditions had been extreme

Passengers gave evidence to MPs of the shocking conditions in which they were left for up to 12 hours without heating, hot food or drink and with access to just one functioning but ‘putrid’ toilet.

One said: ‘Many toilets, which were reliant on electronic flushing mechanisms, were out of action,’Sussex police had to step in to keep order amid the chaos and lack of loudspeaker announcements.

British Airways passengers Neil and Jennifer Smith are quoted by MPs in the report saying: ‘As a result of BA staff’s unwavering refusal to speak to customers or provide any information in the terminal, we received no food or drink vouchers at any stage during our 11 hours at Gatwick.’

Had BA informed them that their luggage was unlikely to be on the plane, ‘we would have bought some essentials from the airport to relieve the stress and discomfort,’ they said.

Dr Sylvia Baron said: ‘All this time no food was provided at any point by easyJet (13 hours total).’

Daniel Salt says: ‘eastJet failed at every stage to notify the public of what was happening.’ 

And Malina Majithia said they received no food or water: ‘More shockingly, the washroom facilities were appalling. The toilets were a disgrace. They did not flush and the putrid stench was overpowering.’ 

Even Labour peer Lord Triesman, caught up in the chaos spoke of ‘distressed and crying and shouting children’ and the ‘massive queue to the only functioning loo.’

Passengers were left for up to 12 hours without heating, hot food or drink and just one toilet to access

Janet Coombs tells MPs: ‘19 hours without food or fluid; 15 hours standing; 15 hours without access to toilets; 2 days lost holiday; 2 nights lost sleep.’

Many phoned relatives outside the airport to find out from news reports what was happening.

Anna Powell spoke of lost luggage, distress, and the ‘joy of securing the last chicken’ in Sainsburys but noted: ‘As far as we were concerned our Christmas was cancelled.’ 

Today the House of Commons Transport Committee thanked those passengers who wrote with their testimony. 

They said the main problems had been poor and often inconsistent provision of information about what was happening, lack of clarity about who was in charge, and a lack of basic facilities, such as toilets and drinking water.

Christmas plans were badly affected for thousands of people after storms across the UK resulted in flooding and caused havoc at Gatwick Airport

The committee welcomed a key conclusion from Gatwick¿s own review of the events on Christmas Eve which found the airport should appoint passenger champions at each of its terminals

The chaos at Gatwick was compounded when airport bosses sought to switch passengers from the blighted North Terminal to the still-working South Terminal in a move that ‘was not well tested.’ 

MPs were particularly concerned the ‘that contingency planning had not involved major airlines.’ 

Launching the report today, the committee’s chairman Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside said: ‘Passengers need accurate and consistent information, must be able to identify who is in charge during periods of disruption, and should have ready access to toilets and drinking water.

‘If our largest airports cannot demonstrate they can look after passengers’ interests in this way then the CAA must act.’ 

She added: ‘Passengers must also be promptly reimbursed for the extra costs they face as a consequence of disruption.'

Mrs Ellman said: ‘It was clear from evidence to this inquiry that there is considerable scope for airlines to ensure passengers are far better informed about their rights when flights are delayed or cancelled and how to enforce these rights.’

The flood caused a power failure which severely disrupted flights at the airport¿s North Terminal

The committee welcomed a key conclusion from Gatwick’s own review of the events on Christmas Eve which found the airport should appoint passenger champions at each of its terminals, to focus on passenger welfare.

The committee suggested that similar arrangements should also be put in place at other major UK airports.

Gatwick’s own report into the chaos concluded in February that passengers were failed because airport bosses ‘overreached themselves’ and communications to passengers were ‘disappointingly poor’.

The flood caused a power failure which severely disrupted flights at the airport’s North Terminal. But rather than cancel flights straight away managers tried to get as many people away as possible - by switching them to the unaffected South Terminal. However, this merely added to the chaos.

Gatwick non-executive director David McMillan said in own February report: ‘On this occasion, the airport community overreached itself in seeking to maintain a close-to-normal flying programme on the day.

MPs demanded to know why the country¿s second-biggest airport had been unable to cope with flooding

‘In doing so, while the majority of airport passengers flew that day, a very significant number of passengers endured poor levels of service and information before seeing their flights either substantially delayed or, ultimately, cancelled.’ 

MPs had earlier accused country’s second-biggest airport -owned by an American private equity Global Infrastructure Partners of failing to invest at Gatwick while making bumper profits.

Transport committee chairman Louise Ellman said the sorts of problems encountered by Gatwick should not have been unforeseen, unexpected or unprepared for: ‘The problems that unfolded were not new and the whole event should be a wake-up call for airports across the UK to improve their operational resilience.’

This was the scene at Gatwick Airport Station on Christmas Eve amid chaos around the airport

The report itself concludes: ‘None of the issues discussed in our report is new. Contingency planning, communications and passenger welfare were all covered in the Begg report into disruption at Heathrow due to snow in December 2011., themes we then picked up in our 2011 report on the disruption to transport caused by snow and ice.’ 

It added: ‘The CAA recently told us that it had already given the industry some guidance about what is expected in relation to oversight of operational resilience.’ 

MPs said the CAA had told them: ‘If the plans produced by airports over the Spring and Summer do not include all appropriate elements, we will use our licence powers to requite this to be remedied.’
