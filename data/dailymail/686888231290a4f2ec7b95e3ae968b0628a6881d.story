Chinese state media has warned readers not to call themselves Dumbledore when choosing an English name.

Chinese people who come to the West to study, work or do business often choose and English sounding name. But it's a process fraught with pitfalls and can result in unintentional hilarity. 

An article published by CCTV News warns readers against using the names of fictional characters or figures from religions or mythology.

Dumbledore: Chinese state media told its readers to avoid fictional characters when choosing a Western name

'As with "famous people" names, these only work if the name is common anyway. Choosing Harry, from Harry Potter is ok. Hercules, Satan, Dumbledore or Jesus, is a different story,' it says.

'Unique names like these aren’t just very amusing to English speakers, it also suggests you have some connection to that name.'

CCTV warns readers to be wary about the connotations of English names, which 'can come with a "feeling" or idea about what sort of person you are.'

When choosing a Western name, Chinese people often merely find a word they have a particular affinity with, then choose its English translation. 

For example a woman born in Autumn might simply call herself after the season. But this method can also have risks.

Choosing a food stuff as a name is particularly popular, yet very risky,warns CCTV. 

'One of the issues here is that food names can be "very" suggestive.

'To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as "non-smart girl" names, or "stripper" names.'

To make matters worse, Dong and Wang, both popular and common family names in China, are in the West colloquial terms for male genitalia.

'So avoid anything like "Bunny Wang" at all times,' CCTV warns.
