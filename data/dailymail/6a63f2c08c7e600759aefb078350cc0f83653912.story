The parents of a 21-year-old Australian jihadi bride who ran off to Syria to marry a playboy turned extremist claim she has been ‘brainwashed’.

Zehra Duman, from Melbourne, reportedly married Mahmoud Abdullatif on December 11 with the pair announcing their marriage on social media with the hashtag #TheIslamicState, the Herald Sun reports.

‘She’s been brainwashed, she wasn’t like this three or four months ago,’ her father Davut Duman told the paper.

Zehra Duman, from Melbourne, was reportedly just a 'normal' Turkish girl from Melbourne four months ago

The pair sickeningly showed of a gun as part of their mahr (dowry) for the bride and Duman is now believed to be living in the murderous Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa.

Abdullatif fled Australia five months ago, turning his back on the nightclubs, flash cars and motorbikes that he and his friends used to enjoy.

Just four months ago, Duman is said to have been a ‘normal Turkish Melbourne girl’ but she’s now reportedly spouting hate against non-Muslims on Twitter and Facebook, the Herald Sun reports.

Her parents are working with authorities to try and bring her home.

Her new husband, Abdullatif, has continued to use social media from Syria, since leaving his old lifestyle behind in Melbourne and regularly posts smiling selfies on Facebook.

The jihadist’s page also features his name spelled out in bullets, a photo of a dead child’s hand and a message encouraging people to burn their passports and join IS.

One bloody image accuses the US and Israel of being ‘child killers’.

In August, his friend posted on old photo of them together as children, dressed up for a family wedding.

‘Remember this pic makes me laugh everytime. Hope ur safe and hope to see u soon inshallah. (""Wait for me at da gates"") love u kuzzii [sic],’ he wrote.

Another friend commented: ‘Missing you Mahmoud Abdullatif xox.’

Back in February, when he is still believed to have been living in the Melbourne suburb of Coburg, Abdullatif commented on a photo of his friends dressed in suits for a wedding.

As the men stood by a white Maserati sports car, Abdullatif wrote: ‘Thanks sis, I need a wife! Lol [sic].’

Abdullatif has only recently changed his name on Facebook and limited who can see his profile.

It's believed Abdullatif and Duman met via social media before she ran away to Syria to be with him

Before he freely posted under his real name to his 1,042 friends on the site. Even now, despite being in Syria, he is still adding new friends.

He belongs to trance night clubbing groups on Facebook and a group called ‘i wonder if i've ever aten a Mcdonalds burger that has been spat in [sic]’.

His ‘likes’ include a page about Swedish girls and one that says ‘Turkish girls are gorgeous’, a page called ‘Trying to convince all 46 b**ches you talk to that you're not a player’ and ‘If She Roll A Good Blunt, Wife That B**tch.’

He’s also a fan of the sexist page ‘High heels were invented so women could put away dishes on the top shelf’.

At some point this year, Abdullatif’s thoughts turned from women and partying in nightclubs to joining the murderous Islamic State group in Syria.

The former playboy continues to post smiling selfies on social media 

A friend told the Herald Sun that they believe he was indoctrinated via social media and that the family didn’t know about his extremist views until he got to Syria.

One post on his Facebook page shows the type of social media propaganda that he has been influenced by.

Taking aim at the 'Kuffar', the Arabic word for 'nonbelievers', one of his profile picture says: 'When you're against a group of Muslims and the Kuffar are against them too, then know that you've aligned yourself with the Kuffar against your own brothers.

'And know that if that's the case, there is definitely something wrong with your view..

'If you want to see where the most righteous of Muslims are, then look at where the arrows of the Kuffar are pointing.'

His family and friends have reportedly tried to persuade him to come back but they don’t believe he is actually fighting in Syria yet.

In one of his posts his name is spelt out in bullets next to a gun 

‘He is always with little kids there. If you were fighting there would not be little kids, maybe the gun is a protection thing but everybody has guns over there,’ the friend said.

Abdullatif’s Lebanese family reportedly live near the Syrian border and have witnessed the country’s brutal civil war.

Meanwhile, his uncle by marriage is a former Operation Pendennis terror suspect who attempted to sue the Victorian Government because of the way he was allegedly treated while he was held in a maximum security jail.

Hany Taha was acquitted of a plot to blow up the MCG stadium and the Crown Casino in Melbourne after being charged with being a member of a terrorist group and attempting to make funds available to it.

He was held on remand from November 2005 to September 2008.
