Recognised today as the pioneer of 
colour photography and the personal documentary style, Eggleston has 
been producing cutting-edge work for over fifty years.  Since first 
picking up a camera in 1957, Eggleston’s work is said to find ‘beauty in
the everyday’. 

His images capture the ordinary world
around him, creating interest through sharp observation, dynamic 
composition and great wit.

His ground-breaking 1976 show at the 
Museum of Modern Art, New York moved colour photography from the field 
of advertising to being recognised as an artform unto itself.

of Martin Parr, Sofia Coppola, Andreas Gurksy and Juergen Teller.

Talking about the award Eggleston 
comments: 'The world is in color. To paraphrase my friend John 
Szarkowski, my attempt has been to see simultaneously, both the blue and
the sky as one thing.'

Astrid Merget, Creative Director of 
the World Photography Organisation comments: 'William Eggleston is a 
without a doubt, one of the great pioneers of our time.  His influence 
on colour photography and subsequently on many of today's most revered 
working photographers, is one to be admired, respected and awarded.
