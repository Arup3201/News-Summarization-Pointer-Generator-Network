A mother-of-nine who claimed £38,000 in benefits and demanded a bigger council house has had twins, adding an extra £1,400 to her taxpayer-funded income.

Cheryl Prudham, 32, gave birth to Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose seven weeks ago, and was given a £200,000 five-bed council house to make room for her 10th and 11th children.

Mrs Prudham now has five children with her husband, Robert, and six more from previous relationships.

Mrs Prudham has previously admitted that her huge brood were not especially planned because she and her husband do not like using contraception

One of the 
family's neighbours in Gravesend, Kent, said: 'It's disgraceful how they
 keep having children and expect taxpayers to foot the bill.

'Hard-working families struggle and only have a couple of kids because they can't afford any more.

'No doubt their new house will be too small now,' they told the Sun.

Speaking
 when she was pregnant with the twins, Mrs Prudham said she would 'not 
be made to feel guilty' for having children as she and her husband both 
work part-time.

They claimed £38,000 in benefits last year, but the extra child benefit will take the figure much nearer to £40,000. 

She also admitted her huge brood were not especially planned because she and her husband do not like using contraception.

Mrs Prudham's nine older children are: George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, Madison, five, Leon, four, Lenny, two, and Lainey, one

Before the twins were born, the Prudhams had Leon, four, Lenny, two, and Lainey, one.

Mrs Prudham also has George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, and Madison, five, from former boyfriends.

Speaking after her bid for a new house last year, she said: 'In the past I have been on contraception but I got pregnant with the coil and the pill just doesn't settle well with me.

'We don't use condoms and me and Rob have never talked about it.

'I did rely on benefits before but I am motivated to be more than a mother.'

And she admitted: 'I was surprised by the cost of our kids in the end.' 

The couple both started working 20 hours per week a week as carers before the baby is born. Neither pays any income tax because their earnings fall below the minimum threshold - earning them just under £1,400 a month.

They then receive £400 child tax credits, topped up by £70 working tax credits, and their £123 a week rent is footed by the council.

They already reportedly receive £7,326 a year in child benefit. 

Andy Silvester, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'There has to be a point where the state stops paying for people's children.'

Last night the Prudhams refused to comment.
