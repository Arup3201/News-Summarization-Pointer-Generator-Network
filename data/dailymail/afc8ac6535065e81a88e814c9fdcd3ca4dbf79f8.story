Standing at 6ft 7in, Stoke striker Peter Crouch often has to peer down at those who are in his company.

But rarely would he ever have to look quite as far down as he did when he stopped for a picture with jockey Nathan Alison, who is 5ft.

Crouch, in Dubai with the Stoke squad who are enjoying a team break in the sunshine, went along to the Dubai Racing Club, where he bumped into the diminutive figure of Alison.

Crouch later tweeted a picture of the image with the above caption 

And the duo posed for a picture together, appearing to laugh at the 1ft 7in difference in height between  them.

Alison, who is competing on Friday, could have ended up being a team-mate of Crouch's had things turned out differently for him when he was younger.

He had trials with Chelsea and Charlton Athletic, but his size meant they eventually turned him away. 

For two years, striker Crouch played for Tottenham, the team that Alison supports

'I wanted to be a footballer, but with my size and height that wasn't going to work out,' Alison said in an interview with GG.com in 2009.

Instead, Tottenham fan Alison would have been looking up to Crouch in more ways than one  when the forward played at White Hart Lane from 2009-11, before moving to Stoke.
