Sir Jimmy Savile could be awarded a posthumous knighthood – so he can then be stripped of it.

The bizarre plan is being considered by the Honours Forfeiture Committee because knighthoods cannot be removed from people who have died.

Those given a knighthood are awarded lifetime membership to a ‘living order’ and the title no longer exists when the holder dies.

A constitutional bar preventing the dead from having their knighthoods removed means the government's forfeiture committee cannot strip Savile of the accolade

A Whitehall source told The Sunday Times: 'The forfeiture committee is certainly looking at the issue.' 

The TV host, who died last year aged 84, was knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award which followed the OBE he was given for services to charity and broadcasting in 1971.

The Queen has the power to remove honours after they have been recommended by the forfeiture committee.

Last year Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, was stripped of his knighthood.

A report published this week by Scotland 
Yard and NSPCC said he DJ spent ‘every waking minute’ thinking about 
abusing children and used his celebrity status to that end. Eighteen 
girls and ten boys aged under ten were abused – the youngest being a boy
of eight targeted at his school.

Allegations of sexual assault have been made by 450 individuals, aged up to 47, and some have yet to be interviewed.

The 214 confirmed offences included 34 rapes and stretch across 28 police force areas. The most recent was in 2009 but they date back as far as 1955.

Lawyers for the victims have already instigated compensation claims against the BBC, NHS and education authorities for failing to stop the serial predator. The payouts could run into millions of pounds.

Victims said it was shocking it had taken so long to expose the DJ’s predatory behaviour.

They said senior managers who missed opportunities to stop him should be named and shamed.
