Return: Gay businessman Ivan Massow, who quit the Tories over their attitude to homosexuality, is hoping to become an MP for the party

A gay businessman who quit the Tories over their attitude to homosexuality is hoping to become an MP for the party.

Ivan Massow has applied to contest the battleground seat of Somerton and Frome in Somerset at the next election.

But hours before he put in his bid last Thursday, the local party chairman resigned from the party in protest at David Cameron’s support for gay marriage.

Edmund Costelloe, whose treasurer also resigned over the issue, accused the Prime Minister of having lost touch with grassroots supporters.

In his resignation speech, the 66-year-old retired surveyor said the party leadership had mounted an ‘undebated and ill thought-out attack on marriage between a man and a woman for the procreation of children’.

Mr Massow, 45, who has made millions in the insurance business, said the Frome seat, which is held by the Lib Dems, was a natural fit for him, with its ‘progressive and liberal-thinking voters’.

He defected to Labour in 2000 saying the Tories, then led by William Hague, had become ‘intolerant and just plain nasty’. He returned a few years later.

Mr Massow, 45, who will be interviewed by local Tories if shortlisted, was unaware of the row when he applied last Thursday. Yesterday he claimed chairman Edmund Costelloe’s views were out of step with locals who are ‘liberal and progressive’.

But Mr Costelloe, whose treasurer also resigned over the issue, accused the Prime Minister of having ‘utterly lost touch’ with grassroots supporters, and said ‘virtually everyone’ he had spoken to disagreed with the plans.

He feared a decision to allow gay weddings- with an exemption for the Church of England and other religions - would stop the party winning the seat, currently held by Liberal Democrat farming minister David Heath, and said many local members had expressed an intention not to renew their memberships this month.

In his resignation speech to the Somerton and Frome Conservative Association, the 66-year-old retired surveyor said: ‘I have always been a Conservative through and through and this still stands.

‘What has changed is the leadership’s undebated and ill-thought-out attack on marriage between a man and a woman for the procreation of children.

‘David Cameron and a group of colleagues have utterly lost touch with the grassroots of the Conservative Party, the majority of whom are outraged by this attack on natural and historic family values.’

Mr Massow told the Mail he had ‘lived in and loved’ the Somerset constituency all his life. Joining the Conservative’s youth wing as teenager, his life story is a rags to riches tale, spending years in the care system and leaving school with one O Level, he made millions in his early 20s by setting up the first insurance firm tailored to gay clients.

‘When it came up I saw myself as a natural for it’, he said. ‘It’s a liberal held seat and all the ultra-Conservative candidates they have had in the past have failed in some respect to appeal to these more progressive and liberal thinking voters.

‘A candidate with more inclusive values would be a bonus in the constituency. I think I could do a good job there for that exact reason.’

Mr Massow said he could bring life experience to the role and that he was ‘jaded’ with career politicians. He defected to Labour in 2000 saying the party, then lead by William Hague had become ‘intolerant and just plain nasty’, but returned some years later.

He said: ‘I’ve always wanted to be an MP, but not for the sake of being an MP. Having grown up in the care system, learned from my successes and failures in business and done charity work I genuinely, genuinely think I’ve got something to give back’

While he disagreed with critics of gay marriage, he said he would ‘agree to disagree’ with voters on the issue and conceded many of his friends agreed with Mr Costelloe. ‘I’ve got lots of close friends who seem so open minded and right on who agree with him’, he said.

‘I know it comes from a place of goodness and know they genuinely believe in something, but I don’t have any time for the view itself. David Cameron has to be strong like Tony Blair had to be strong when he nipped that tendency in the bud.’

The West Country seat is held by Mr Heath with a majority of 1,819. Mr Costelloe said: ‘When you have a majority of 20,000 the local party can go hang, but this is a marginal seat and David Cameron has to win it if he wants to form a government and that means a lot of work by local activists before election day.

‘You need old ladies stuffing envelopes, people canvassing, and all those things are about keeping your membership as high as possible. In the shires the majority of people are against it and it’s a matter of astonishment to me that something making people leave the party is even being considered. It has been pushed over everyone’s heads, and there is a form of self-censorship at the top of the party about it.’
