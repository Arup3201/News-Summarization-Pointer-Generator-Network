Not again. Not now. As news of Daniel Sturridge’s latest injury setback emerged, those four words will have swirled around Brendan Rodgers’ mind.

Liverpool’s manager has become accustomed to picking teams that do not contain Sturridge — he went from August 31 to January 31 without him, remember — but, as the campaign reaches its defining moment, this is not something he will relish.

It was bad enough to lose his captain Steven Gerrard to a three-match suspension last Sunday, and the FA’s decision to give Martin Skrtel, Liverpool’s best defender, the same ban for stamping on David de Gea exacerbated the problem.

The new setback is another blow in a season that has been ruined by injury for the Liverpool striker

Immediately after the international break is over, no team in the Barclays Premier League has more at stake than Liverpool, who have a lunchtime trip to Arsenal next Saturday followed by an FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn four days later.

Gerrard and Skrtel would have had big contributions to make to those fixtures and, without them, there is absolutely no doubt Liverpool’s chances of success have been compromised. Taking Sturridge away has an even greater impact.

Lose at the Emirates Stadium and Ewood Park and the campaign that Liverpool have fought hard to resurrect since Rodgers changed his system to 3-4-3 will effectively be over. That is what is on the line. That is why Rodgers needs Sturridge fit.

At this point, it should be noted Sturridge has not set the world alight since he returned as a substitute against West Ham at the end of January. There have been some flashes of star quality but, in a lot of games, his performances could kindly be described as ‘enigmatic’.

The thing with Sturridge, however, is that he scores. ‘He is an absolute nightmare for a defender when he is on it,’ Gerrard once observed.

Even when he is playing poorly — like last Sunday against Manchester United — you cannot discount him for a moment. He has poise and awareness in the penalty area and it is why Rodgers believe he can become one of Europe’s top strikers.

Note the words ‘can become’: something is holding Sturridge back from fulfilling his potential. Can his body stand up to the rigours of football at the highest level? Or is it more psychological than physical?

‘If Daniel had Wayne Rooney’s mentality, he’d be almost unstoppable,’ Jamie Carragher wrote in these pages during the World Cup last summer. ‘Wayne will play through the pain barrier and won’t let a niggle keep him out of the action.

‘Luis Suarez is another who stays away from the treatment room at all costs. With Daniel, however, there was a feeling that everything had to be right for him to train or play. If a knock was playing on his mind, he would want it assessed to be sure he could play at the weekend.’

Sturridge’s latest ailment concerns his hip. He damaged it against United and, after a scan at St George’s Park following a recovery session on Monday, it was left to England manager Roy Hodgson to report that he has suffered ‘a small tear’ to his flexor muscles.

Given all that has happened this season, with his initial calf problem being sustained on September 5, it left the 25-year-old ‘absolutely devastated’ that he could not figure in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

The question now, however, concerns how quickly he will be able to recover. It has been mooted that he could be out for up to a month and while that prognosis may seem overly pessimistic, history has shown it is not prudent to give definitive timescales when Sturridge is being treated.

You would think, then, given what is at stake, he will now be redoubling his efforts to be ready for the trip to Arsenal. Rodgers will certainly hope so as Mario Balotelli is the only other recognised striker to score for Liverpool since January 31.

‘Winning games and scoring goals is the motto,’ Sturridge posted on Instagram last October. ‘Don’t think people realise how hard it is mentally being injured. I’ve had a lot of time to reflect. Can’t wait to be back!! Best feeling is to be playing football and I take it for granted when you’re fit.’

Much to his dismay, Sturridge has had a lot of time to think this season. His manager will be hoping he gets a lot of time to score. A Champions League place and the FA Cup are at stake.
