A man who went on television to tell of his 'neighbours from hell' has had his house ransacked and the word 'dead' scrawled on his living room wall.

Robert Crowley appeared on Channel 5's 'Extreme Nightmare Neighbours Next Door' last year and told of a series of clashes with a fellow resident of Bow, Devon.

Mr Crowley has now gone to police after he found his home doused in a flammable liquid and red paint daubed on his walls.

Robert Cowley came home this weekend to find his house ransacked and soaked in flammable liquid

The 61-year-old came home earlier this month to find his cottage had been broken into and a thick liquid had been poured over his carpets and floors of his kitchen and living room.

The word 'dead' has been painted over the father-of-one's living room wall, leaving Mr Crowley in fear for his life.

After a previous break in, Mr Crowley had installed CCTV at his home, but the devices' wires had been cut, meaning he did not have footage of the incident.

He said: 'All of my kit has been ruined and I don't have contents insurance. I've been down on my finances, so I cancelled it in December to save money.'

But the former electrician, who has battled cancer, has said he has already 'stared death in the face' and so is trying to remain positive.

He added: 'The fact they didn't burn the house down shows they must have some degree of what is right and what is wrong.' 

The word 'dead' had been scrawled on Mr Crowley's living room wall in red lettering during the break-in

Mr Crowley has suffered numerous attacks since moving to the village in 2010.

Arrests were made following a previous campaign of abuse which later resulted in several convictions for criminal damage.

Mr Crowley had to fit security bars to his windows and install security cameras just to feel safe in his own home.

'I feel other neighbours have shunned me,' he said, 'but I will never be forced from my home.'

Detective Sergeant Gus Cottey said: 'We will always act on information passed to us to support the community and the area where we live.'

'To all members of the public I would appeal for people to come forward if you have lived in Bow and have had any harassment, report it to the police.'

Devon and Cornwall Police arrested three people between the ages of 23 and 65 in connection with the incident on Tuesday morning.

He was forced to clean-up the black flammable liquid which was in his carpet and over his kitchen floor
