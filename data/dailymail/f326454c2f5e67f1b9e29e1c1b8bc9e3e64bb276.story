Lionel Messi set tongues wagging about a possible move to Chelsea on Monday.

A day after being left out of Barcelona’s starting team to face Real Sociedad, Messi fuelled rumours that he wants to leave the Nou Camp.

The 27-year-old missed an open training session attended by thousands of children on Monday and later started following Chelsea on Instagram.

He also started following Blues stars Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luis on the picture sharing website.

However, Chelsea should also note that the four-time player of the year also follows Manchester City, Newell’s Old Boys, Argentina and Barcelona on Instagram.

Mourinho refuted claims in November suggesting Chelsea were keen on signing Messi. 

He said: 'My reaction is that your world changed so much that our world also changed so much. And I think, in this moment, it's so easy, so easy to have non-truths circulating.

'It's so easy that some people put news without confirming or speaks about rumours. Obviously it's not true. Obviously it's not true.'

Fabregas said last month that he would be keen on linking back up with his former Barcelona team-mate. 

When asked if he thinks Messi should join Chelsea, Fabregas replied: 'I wish! Why not? I'd love that to happen. I'd be all for it.

'As a Barca man, I believe that Messi deserves to retire there for all that he has given the club. 

'He is a legend that has changed Barca's history. But, as his team-mate and friend, without doubt I'd love to have Leo by my side.

'This season Barca are Messi and 10 others. Messi has saved his team on many occasions.' 

Speculation linking Messi with a move to the Premier League comes as Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and Carles Puyol departed the La Liga outfit.
