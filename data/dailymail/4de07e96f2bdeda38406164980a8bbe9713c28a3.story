From Beach Haus to the beach.

Mitchell Pearce has used a rare day off from Roosters training to dive beneath the waves - and away from the controversy surrounding his infamous Kings Cross nightclub incident - on Sydney's northern beaches.

And while the halfback enjoyed the sand and surf at Dee Why, MailOnline can reveal the woman he allegedly approached on the nightclub dance floor was holed up at work at a phone shop in the inner west.

Yellow fever: The woman at the centre of the Mitchell Pearce nightclub controversy Melissa Arroja used a brief work break on Thursday to go shopping. True to form, she was wearing lots of bright yellow

And Melissa Arroja, who made a complaint to uniformed police patrolling the Beach Haus club after Mitchell Pearce appeared to grab her in the early morning hours of May 11, really likes her yellow.

As these exclusive photographs reveal, the woman famous for boasting about her bright yellow dress and its ability to attract footballers can't get enough of the colour. 

She was spotted wearing an incredibly bright yellow necklace and yellow nail polish during a brief trip to the shops on Thursday.

She declined to talk to MailOnline, however her boss said she has been 'in tears' in the days since the incident.

Feeling the heat: Arroja was in no mood to talk to MailOnline on Thursday

Happier times: Arroja chose to out herself as the mystery woman on social media

'I was looking after her all last week when she was in tears,' he said.

'She's been really good about it...she wants it all to go away. She's been advised not to talk about it.'

Her identity was first revealed when she posted photos of herself from her 'melzbubblebutt' Instagram account along with the caption '#girlintheyellowdress'.

She also wrote on Facebook 'Who would have thought a Sat night at Beach Haus in the cross wearing a yellow dress would cause such a drama!! Never thought I would make the headlines WTF'.

Soon after her name went public she went to ground and deleted her social media accounts, which were sprawling with revealing photos of Ms Arroja in racy outfits. Her bright yellow dress featured in a number of snaps.

Charges were never laid against Mitchell Pearce after Ms Arroja decided not to pursue the matter with police.

However the drunken incident cost the NRL star his likely spot in the NSW Origin side and $20,000 by way of a fine from the Sydney Roosters. He was also stood down for one game by the club.

On the morning of the incident he was led away in handcuffs and fined $500 for refusing to leave a licensed premises. CCTV footage from inside the club was featured on news bulletins across the country.

Melissa Arroja's father Antonio told MailOnline he was proud of his daughter and that she acted as any young woman should.

'She's not a child. She's done nothing wrong...if she was in trouble with police then I'd be worried,' he said.

Repentant Rooster: Pearce has since apologised for his behaviour and vowed to give up the booze

Between the flags: Pearce flexed his muscles at Dee Why on Thursday afternoon and enjoyed a brief swim

Ms Arroja remains visibly stressed about the incident and has refused all media requests. 

Mitchell Pearce spent his Thursday afternoon at the beach mingling with fans, sun baking and talking on his phone. Another beach-goer said the Roosters play maker enjoyed a brief swim and was seen flexing his muscles.

Last week the star play maker vowed to give up alcohol for the rest of the season and apologised to Ms Arroja, his parents and his girlfriend Phoebe Carpenter for his actions.

'Firstly I want to say sorry for my parents, who are my biggest supporters. I let them down, embarrassed them and they’ve had to wear the brunt the last couple of days, which has been hard for them,' he told reporters.
