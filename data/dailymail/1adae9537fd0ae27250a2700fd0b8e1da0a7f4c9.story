Chocolat author Joanne Harris blasted the app, saying what starts out with blanking out a few words ends with 'burning libraries'

As one person bluntly put, it is ‘f****** horrifying’.

An app that blanks out swear words in e-books has prompted outrage among writers including Chocolat author Joanne Harris, who have accused it of censoring their work without permission.

Last night Mrs Harris, 50, took to her blog to write a scathing critique of the Clean Reader application which has been designed to help parents protect their children from explicit content.

It operates on a sliding scale from ‘clean’, which removes only the worst swear words, to ‘squeaky clean’ which even takes out ‘damn’.

Condemning the app on her blog, in a post titled ‘why I’m saying “f*** you” to Clean Reader’, Mrs Harris, whose book was turned into a Hollywood film starring Juliette Binoche, 51, and Johnny Depp, 51, likened the programme to examples of suppression from history.

She said: 'Anyone who works with words understands their power. Words, if used correctly, can achieve almost anything. 

'To tamper with what is written – however much we may dislike certain words and phrases – is to embrace censorship.

‘We’ve been down this road before. We should know where it leads by now. It starts with blanking out a few words. It goes on to drape table legs and stick fig leaves onto statues. 

'It progresses to denouncing gay or Jewish artists as “degenerate”. It ends with burning libraries and erasing whole civilizations from history.’

She added: ‘Apps like Clean Reader change the text without the author’s permission. 

'They take the author’s words and replace them – sometimes very clumsily – on the basis of some perceived idea of “bad words” versus “good words”. 

'No permission is sought, or granted. There is no opt-out clause for authors or publishers.’

Mrs Harris was not the only writer to take offence to the app, which is downloadable on Apple and Android devices and is free.

Laurie Penny, a journalist and author, said: ‘There’s now an app for taking the swearwords out of books. I find this f****** horrifying’.

Charlie Stross, a science fiction writer wrote on Twitter: ‘This - from an author’s point of view - is an obscenity: algorithmic censorship of ebooks.’

The app has three settings, clean, cleaner and squeaky clean (left) that will blank out offensive words on a table reader. The 'squeaky clean' setting will even cross out 'damn' and 'darn' (right)

Linda Acaster, a novelist from Yorkshire, argued: ‘The first act of a dictatorship is to censor books. The second is to ban them. The third is to burn them.’

And last night members of the public waded into the row, with one posting on Twitter: ‘A horrifying slippery slope’

Another wrote: ‘Really bad news. And damn stupid. See what I did there Clean Reader!’

In an attempt to placate the anger, messages were posted by the Clean Reader Twitter account, including one which read: I’m sure the F-word isn’t the only thing that makes your books great!’

But it only appeared to add fire to the row, with one writer posting ‘you should have a very serious think about your app. It’s censorship, plain and simple.’

Clean Reader was designed by American couple Jared and Kirsten Maughan amid concern about a book their daughter had read.

Publicity material for the app, states: ‘We told her that there was probably an app for this type of thing that would replace profanity with less offensive words and perhaps we should get her a tablet that she could use to read books with.

‘To our surprise there wasn’t an app like this. The more we thought about this idea the more we wanted it to be a reality. 

'Eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring Clean Reader to the world.’
