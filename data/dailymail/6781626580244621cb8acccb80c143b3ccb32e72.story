Hacker groups believed to be behind a breach of the systems of Sony and CIA have vowed to unite against world governments.

LulzSec enlisted the help of the group known as Anonymous in their cybercampaign dubbed 'Operation Anti-Security'.

The groups announced their intentions on their official Twitter feeds at the weekend saying they would target anyone who got in their way - and that could include the British Government.

One of the messages put up by the group LulzSec as it sets about on its cyber-attack against world governments

World governments, including the UK's, are at risk of being targeted by LulzSec and Anonymous

They said: 'Welcome to Operation Anti-Security. We encourage any vessel, large or small, to open fire on any government or agency that crosses their path. We fully endorse the flaunting of the word 'AntiSec' on any government website defacement or physical graffiti art.'

LulzSec is believed to be behind the idea and also hinted at joining forces with other 'hacking groups' saying 'To increase efforts, we are now teaming up with the Anonymous collective and all affiliated battleships.'

Among their goals, the groups declared 'immediate and unremitting war on the freedom-snatching moderators of 2011' in defiance at internet regulations.

And it's not just governments that are potential victims 'Prime targets are banks and other high-ranking establishments', the groups said.

One of the main aims is to steal and then leak any  classified information including emails and documents.

Sega's 'Free Pass' system recently came under attack from cyber-anarchists

It is believed their attacks are a retaliation to proposed increase in sentence for cyberterrorists in the U.S that would see people who break into the U.S. government's systems facing 20 years in prison.

LulzSec says it doesn't hack for profit but 'to have fun by causing mayhem.'

It was recently revealed that Sega became the latest computer game giant to fall prey to hackers.

The company sent an email to users of the Sega Pass system yesterday, warning that email addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords had been obtained.

However it said that no financial information was at risk.

The Sega Pass system was taken offline on Thursday and all users' passwords have been reset.

This comes after attacks on Sony and another games company, Codemasters.

In April Sony had data stolen from the 77 million users of the PlayStation network, one of the worst security breaches of its kind.

There was then a second attack when another 24.6 million computer game users might have had their personal details stolen.

Personal information and passwords were taken in the hack on Codemasters earlier this month, but not financial details.

The hackers who claimed responsibility for the Sony attack, LulzSec, have apparently denied the Sega intrusion.
