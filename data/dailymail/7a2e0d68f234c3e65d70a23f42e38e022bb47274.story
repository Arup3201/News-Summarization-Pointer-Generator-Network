An army major has been charged with murdering his wife following her death at the couple's country home in Wallan, Victoria.

David Whitelegg was arrested shortly after police attended the home, 50km north of Melbourne, when his wife Anne was found dead at about 11.30am on Sunday.

Mr Whitelegg has reportedly served in both the Australian and British armed forced, Nine News reports.

Some neighbours of Cavallo Crescent said they were shocked to hear of the suspected murder as the couple had shown no signs of trouble.

However one neighbour, who did not want to be named, claimed Mr Whitelegg 'was unpleasant, difficult', the Herald Sun reports.

It is believed the 53-year-old left the British Army five years ago.

Anne Whitelegg, in her 50s, had been a nurse at LaTrobe Private Hospital until it closed last month.

Mr Whitelegg appeared at an out of sessions hearing on Tuesday morning and was remanded in custody.

He is expected to face the Melbourne Magistrates Court later on in the day.
