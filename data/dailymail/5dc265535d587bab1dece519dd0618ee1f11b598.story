A couple have won £1million after an absent-minded friend bought them a EuroMillions ticket instead of the scratchcard they asked for.

Claire McManus and her partner Scott Connah, both 30, had asked their friend to pick them up a scratchcard at their local corner shop in North Wales, but she came back with a lottery ticket instead.

But the newly-wealthy couple aren't complaining about the mix-up after the ticket won them £1million.

Mix-up: Claire McManus and Scott Connah have scooped £1million after their friend bought them a lottery ticket instead of the scratch card they asked for

'This is the best misunderstanding I've ever had,' said mum-of-three Ms McManus, who said she has barely slept since she learned of the windfall on New Year's Day.

'It is simply amazing. We buy the odd scratchcard but don't normally play the lottery.

'We asked our friend to get us a scratchcard but she came back with a EuroMillions ticket instead.

'The news is still sinking in.'

The full-time mother said she had been 
nervous about the possibility of impending bad luck after taking down 
her Christmas decorations early this year.

A
friend had told her doing so was bad luck, but Ms McManus' fears turned
out to be unfounded when stunned Mr Connah called her downstairs on New
Year's Day to double-check their winning ticket.

'I checked it, and checked it again, and then asked Scott to check it, and then we got my parents to check it,' said Ms McManus.

'We just couldn't believe it was real.

'When
we had the ticket confirmed as a winning raffle number the lady from 
Camelot said to me: "Congratulations, you're a millionairess".

'I just sat on the floor and laughed and cried. I haven't slept since we won.

'The
funny thing is, we took our Christmas decorations down that day which a
friend told me was bad luck, but I think I'll do it again next year.'

The lucky couple are planning to enjoy a family holiday and to fulfill their ambition of buying their own home thanks to their lottery win.

They also said they planned to make sure their close friends and family were 'properly looked after' following the happy accident.

'Best misunderstanding ever': The couple became millionaires overnight thanks to the mix-up
