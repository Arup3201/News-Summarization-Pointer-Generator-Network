A mother risked her own health for that of her unborn son when she delayed having chemotherapy until he was born.

Justine Colbeck, 36, was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was just 31 weeks pregnant.

She decided to delay chemotherapy treatment to give her baby boy the best chance of being born healthy.

Sebastian, now nine months old, was born on Christmas Eve last year and Mrs Colbeck started her treatment for breast cancer just ten days later.

Mrs Colbeck was able to breast feed Sebastian for ten days before starting chemotherapy treatment

After undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a mastectomy, she is now on the road to recovery.

Mrs Colbeck, from Garstang, Lancashire, said she does not regret delaying her treatment.

She said: 'It wasn't a difficult decision - our baby had to come first.

'The cancer could have spread because we'd delayed the treatment. Sitting in the waiting room to find out with my ten day old baby was the most terrifying moment of my life.

'If I'd had treatment during my pregnancy then every time Sebastian got sick I would be questioning if it was my fault.

'I couldn't have lived with that.'

Mrs Colbeck and husband Logan, 35, found out they were expecting a baby in June last year.

They had always wanted a little brother or sister for their six-year-old son Zachary, but after five years, the pregnancy came as a surprise.

Mrs Colbeck, a dentist, said: 'Sebastian was a very wanted baby, but I was working full time and having another baby had just gone to the back of my mind.

'We were delighted when we found out.

'My boobs got a lot bigger and both were lumpy during my pregnancies - it was the way I knew I was pregnant in the first place - but as I got further into this one I realised one of them was getting smaller.

'I knew something wasn't right, so I made an appointment with the midwife.

'I was very lucky she took me seriously. I have since heard stories of other women my age being fobbed off because they are "too young for breast cancer". 

Sebastian was born on Christmas eve, and his parents were delighted that Zachary, six, had a little brother

Breast cancer during pregnancy is very rare, occurring in about 1 in 3,000 pregnancies.

Most women are between 32 and 38 years old when they are diagnosed.

During pregnancy, a woman's breasts change in readiness for breastfeeding, with the breast tissue becoming more dense.

This can make it more difficult to find changes in the breast that are due to cancer, such as a lump.  

In fact, research shows that during pregnancy, there is often a delay in diagnosis in women who get breast symptoms.  

Of those women diagnosed with cancer, most are able to carry on with their pregnancy.

Rarely, some may need to think about whether to end the pregnancy (termination). 

But usually this is only necessary if chemotherapy is needed and the woman is less than 14 weeks pregnant. 

Usually it is possible to delay chemotherapy treatment until after  the 14 week stage.

Following an examination by her midwife and her GP, Mrs Colbeck was urgently referred to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary.

Further tests over the next two weeks confirmed her worst fears - that she had breast cancer.

She said: 'It didn't come as a shock to me because of my medical background. 

By the time I was seen by the breast unit, the nipple was already being pulled to one side and the skin under my nipple was puckered due to the spreading cancer.

'I hadn't told Logan at that point because I didn't want to worry him when I had no proof, but when I did he was incredible.

'He came straight to the next appointment with me, where we were told about treatment.'

Mr and Mrs Colbeck then faced the agonising decision of whether to start her chemotherapy straight away or delay it until after Sebastian was born, risking that the cancer would spread further.

Mrs Colbeck said: 'There was an option for me to start chemotherapy straight away, with a reduced-strength drug, given weekly instead of once every three weeks.

'But I was already 33 weeks pregnant and it wasn't certain that I would see out the course before giving birth.

'There was also little evidence of what the drugs could do to my baby in the long term and it would have meant I couldn't breastfeed him when he was born.

'I had breastfed my first son until he was nine months old. I loved it and felt it gave the best of starts for the baby.

'Logan and I discussed it and we decided we needed to put him first.' 

In the end, Mrs Colbeck was induced three weeks early and Sebastian was born on Christmas Eve, weighing 5lb 8oz.

She she said she tried to keep Christmas as normal as possible for Zachary and opened presents in the hospital as a family.

Mrs Colbeck is now at home enjoying time with her two boys Zachary, six and Sebastian, nine months old at their family home in Garstang, Lancashire

She was then able to breastfeed Sebastian for 10 days before she started chemotherapy on January 3 this year.

She said: 'I was worrying about making the switch, but because it was just 10 days, Sebastian did it no problem.

'With all the "breast is best" publicity I was worried about him, but I needn't have. He has grown into a perfectly healthy little baby.'

She endured six rounds of chemotherapy at full strength, but then developed an infection which delayed her mastectomy until June.

Seven weeks after the surgery she started radiotherapy, which finished three weeks ago.

She now must have a chemotherapy injection every three weeks until March, and after that will take tablets for the next 10 years to help prevent the cancer coming back.

Mrs Colbeck said: 'I don't regret the decision for a second.

'I could never have forgiven myself if I'd had the treatment while pregnant and something had happened to Sebastian.'

Mrs Colbeck and husband Logan, 35, a strategic manger were 'delighted' when they discovered she was pregnant with her second child as it came as a surprise

Her husband, a strategic manager, has now carried out a charity swim for Cancer Care and they are hoping to raise money for the oncology unit at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary.

He said: 'I never thought that I would be 34 years old and being told my wife has cancer.

'My main worry was the boys. To not have their mum around from an early age would have been devastating.

'We worked through the problem together and decided to get the baby here first.

'Spending Christmas in hospital was different, but we made it work.

'We couldn't have asked for more from Justine's treatment.

'[The local charity] Cancer Care were also there for us the whole time. They had chats with the whole family to make sure everyone was okay.

'The swim raised around £1,300 and we are now looking to do something for the oncology unit.'
