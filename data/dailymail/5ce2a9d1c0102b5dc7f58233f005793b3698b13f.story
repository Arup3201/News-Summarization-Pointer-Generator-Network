Mizanur Rahman, who was jailed for six years in 2007 after calling for British soldiers killed in Iraq, manages the Siddeeq Academy in Tower Hamlets

An Islamic tuition centre in East London was raided by police as part of a counter-terrorism investigation after it was linked to a convicted extremist.

Mizanur Rahman, who was jailed for six years in 2007 after calling for British soldiers to be brought back from Iraq in bodybags, manages the Siddeeq Academy in Tower Hamlets.

The 'Islamic education and tuition centre' was among a number of residential and business adresses raided in an operation targeting leadership of the proscribed group once known as Al-Muhajiroun.

Police moved against the organisation, banned under anti-terror laws, on the eve of the first British airstrikes against Islamic State militants waging war in Iraq and Syria.

Rahman was arrested alongside prominent radical Islamists including Anjem Choudary, Trevor Brooks - who goes by the Arabic name Abu Izzadeen - and Abdul Muhid.

Brooks was charged with two counts of breaching his notification requirement and the rest were released on police bail.

The private Siddeeq academy, one of around 18 premises searched, provides courses in Arabic, the Koran and Islamic law, as well as national curriculum subjects including English, maths and science.

Its website promises 'an Islamic environment for your child', boasting: 'With quality, professional tutors, resources, equipment and small sizes, you can include us in your child`s education programme with confidence.'

Rahman took to Twitter to complain about his treatment by police after he was released on bail. 'The entire arrest was only an excuse to distrupt our lives, steal £10,000s property & restrict us from speaking against their foreign policy,' he tweeted.

He also claimed police snatched a LeapPad child's tablet computer today from his four-year-old daughter, joking bitterly: 'Dangerous terrorist equipment apparently.'

The Sunday Times claims that the children of at least two convicted terrorists attend classes at the academy. MailOnline has tried to contact Rahman for comment but received no reply by the time of publication.

Earlier this year, Rahman was investigated by police after a video showed him praising the Boko Haram militants who kidnapped more than 300 Nigerian schoolgirls.

He said in the video: ‘People want to make it out as though history began on the day these girls were taken from - sorry I should say these women - were taken from this high school in Nigeria.

‘They didn’t do to these girls what the Nigerian government had been doing to the Muslims all these years. ‘They didn’t rape anybody. They didn’t torture. They didn’t murder any of these girls.’

Rahman was jailed between 2007 and 2010 for calling for the killing of UK troops in Iraq.

He told a crowd of around 300 near the Danish Embassy in central London in February last year that British and American troops should return in body bags.

The Old Bailey saw film of Rahman in which he said: 'We want to see them coming home in body bags.

'We want to see their blood running in the streets of Baghdad.'

He added: 'We want to see the Mujahideen shoot down their planes the way we shoot down birds, we want to see their tanks burn in the way we burn their flags.'

Rahman also had placards calling for the annihilation and beheading of those who insulted Islam.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said: 'He incited or encouraged others to murder in the name of religion.'
