A northwestern Indiana police officer has died after being shot in an apparent ambush by a man who subsequently killed himself.

Merrillville police Officer Nickolaus Schultz had been on the police force for about a year when he was shot in the head Friday night.

Police spokesman Robert Byrd says the 24-year-old Schultz died Sunday.

A vigil was held for Schultz, who died while responding to a call about a 33-year-old man moving back into a condo he'd been evicted from

CBS Chicago reports Schultz was one of several officers who responded to a complaint at a condo at 8219 Lincoln Circle when it was discovered an evicted man had moved back in.

The man, 33-year-old Michael Hernciar, was wearing body armor when police arrived shot Schultz in the head.

A SWAT team was called in to retrieve Schultz, who may have been pulled into the condo by Hernciar.

Hernciar was found dead on the scene, though it's still uncertain whether he took his own life or was killed by police gunfire.

The bomb squad was also called in as it's believed Hernciar had some type of explosive hidden.

Residents were evacuated while the police secured the area.

Schultz was taken to Christ Hospital in critical condition and was pronounced dead Sunday.

Schultz graduated last year from central Indiana's Franklin College, where he was a football captain

Neighbor Derrick Blakley told reporters he think Hernciar broke under the pressure after a series of traumatic events.

'He lost his job not too long ago,' Blakley said. 'I think it's just a spiraling effect. Lost his job, lost his home.'

Schultz graduated last year from central Indiana's Franklin College, where he was a football captain. Dozens of Franklin students attended a vigil for Schultz on Sunday.
