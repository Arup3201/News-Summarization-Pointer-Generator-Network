Passengers on board the stricken Costa Allegra will not make landfall until at least Thursday, more than 72 hours after the ship first lost power in the Indian Ocean.

The 1,049 passengers and crew have been forced to stay up on the deck of the ship to keep cool after a fire in the engine room, left the vessel without power, lights and air-conditioning.

Fresh food is said to have run out and is being airlifted in by helicopters as a French fishing trawler, called Trevignon, tows Allegra from the pirate-infested waters to safety.

It was initially heading towards the island of Desroches, where it was expected to dock this afternoon.

But Costa Cruises has now revealed it will proceed to the Seychelles capital of Mahe, because of 'safety and security issues', where it should arrive in two days.

A statement said: 'The disembarkation in Desroches does not assure the necessary and adequate security conditions for mooring the ship and guests’ disembarkation. 

'In addition, logistics and hotels on the island are not enough. Thus the ship will be towed to Mahe also with the assistance of two tugs that are approaching the ship and that would allow to increase the speed.'

Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into how the fire started in the crippled liner's engine room.

Chief prosecutor Michele Di Lecce, 
who is based in Genoa, where Costa has its HQ, said: 'From the 
information we have we know there was a fire onboard and we need to 
investigate how it started and what caused it. The fire started in 
international waters so the jurisdiction is down to us as the ship is 
Italian.

Thirty one British passengers are 
among holidaymakers onboard and to combat the heat as air conditioning 
is not working, they have all been gathered on the outer decks of the 
ship.

In a statement Genoa based Costa Cruises
said they were 'all served a cold breakfast' while the Allegra's 
captain Nicolo Alba was in constant touch with the Trevignon and 
maritime authorities.

Italian
coastguard officials in Rome who are co-ordinating the rescue have said
the Allegra is in no immediate danger and she is 'upright and 
floating', adding that weather in the area was calm with the odd shower 
passing through.

Onboard the
Allegra, which was a week into a month long cruise of the Indian Ocean,
Red Sea and the Mediterranean, are nine Italian marines from the elite 
San Marco regiment, who are armed with Hecker and Koch submachine guns 
and who ready to defend the ship from possible pirate attacks.

The area off the east African coast has been targeted by Somali pirates in the past and the marines are there as a deterrent.

The
ship had been due to make its way north through the Indian Ocean with 
stops in Mauritius, Madagascar and the Seychelles before heading to 
Oman, Jordan, Egypt and finally ending in the Italian port of Savona on 
March 17.

Costa sources said the most likely cause of the fire was an 'electrical fault' and that it would be thoroughly investigated.

The
incident is another blow to Carnival-owned Costa Cruises, which is 
still investigating the Costa Concordia tragedy, which occurred in 
January, when the vessel hit rocks off the coast of Italy, killing 25, 
with seven still missing and presumed dead.

The captain of the Concordia, 
Francesco Schettino, is also under investigation after he allegedly 
changed course so the ship could carry out a sail by salute of the 
Italian island of Giglio but it struck rocks tearing a 70 m gash in its 
hull and is now lying partly submerged on its side on rocks.

Schettino
is facing accusations of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, 
abandoning ship with passengers still onboard and failing to communicate
properly with maritime authorities.

Costa officials were last night locked in discussions over the compensation package that  would be offered to passengers.

Last month it offered payouts of £9,319 to more than 3,000 passengers on the Costa Concordia.

The total bill is expected to top more than £30million.
