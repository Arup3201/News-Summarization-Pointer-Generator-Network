Under Sharia law, which ISIS partially adheres to, women are prevented from fighting.

Jihadists are believed to be terrified of being killed by a female because they think it will stop them getting their 72 virgins in heaven.

But men - and even boys as young as 13 - have been given powerful machine guns and are expected to join the cause.

The photographs were revealed just five days after it emerged three men from the region  were accused of homosexuality  and publicly beheaded by a sword-wielding ISIS executioner.

Iraqi troops and militia are battling to push ISIS back from the area with support from a US-led coalition and Iran.

But retaking Nineveh and Mosul poses a major challenge for Baghdad's forces, as the militants have had more than nine months to dig in.

Iraqi forces launched a huge operation last week aimed at retaking the city of Tikrit that, if successful, would serve as a stepping stone towards Mosul.
