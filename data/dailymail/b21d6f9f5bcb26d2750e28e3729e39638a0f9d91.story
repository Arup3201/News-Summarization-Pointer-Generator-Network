Two of Everton's most promising young stars helped to give something back to the community on Tuesday, when they met up with Children in Need mascot Pudsey Bear.

England midfielder Ross Barkley and Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku took time away from training to play football with the iconic bear.

Barkley and Lukaku showed off their ball-juggling skills and helped Pudsey improve his heading technique at Everton's Finch Farm training ground.

The stars were also joined by Everton mascot Changy the Elephant, and the unlikely foursome looked to be having a great time.

Children in Need have helped to support Everton's disability programme, and the players recognised the importance of the work the charity does.

Lukaku said: 'It's great to welcome Pudsey down to the training ground and for the Club to show our support for such an incredible charity.'
