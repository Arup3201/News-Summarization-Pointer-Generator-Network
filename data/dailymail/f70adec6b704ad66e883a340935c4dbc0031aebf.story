A driver had a lucky escape after his car smashed through a fence and plunged down a steep bank into an unsuspecting homeowner's back garden.

Neighbours looked on in shock as the blue Ford Fiesta came to halt just yards from a glass conservatory in a quiet residential road in Barepot, Cumbria.

Despite the dramatic crash, the driver was able to crawl out of his vehicle unhurt - with a cup of strong, sugary tea on offer from a friendly neighbour to help him deal with the shock.

Escape: As the car landed on its roof and was badly damaged, neighbours were amazed to see the driver climbing out one of the vehicle's doors only seconds later

The accident happened when the driver lost control of his vehicle while travelling along Workington Road on the main road between Seaton and Northside on the west Cumbrian coast.

As he approached a junction, the man's car careered off the road, smashed into a fence, plunged down an embankment and came to a rest in the back garden of a property in Yearl Rise - a quiet residential street in the tiny village of Barepot.

As the car landed on its roof and was badly damaged, neighbours were amazed to see the driver climbing out one of the vehicle's doors only seconds later.

Although he is not thought to have suffered any injuries, the man was taken to hospital for treatment.

Margaret Short lives next door to the house the driver landed in and was the first person on the scene.

'It was an almighty bang - I have never heard anything like it. He managed to crawl out by himself,' she said.

'I couldn't believe it when I saw the car upside down on the lawn. He was really shaken up so I made him a cup of tea with lots of sugar.'
