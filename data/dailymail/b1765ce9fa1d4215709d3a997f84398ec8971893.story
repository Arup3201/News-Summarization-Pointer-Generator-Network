Have you embraced the newest super-berry on the block? The Scandinavian lingonberry — a dark red soft fruit.

Research shows drinking the juice can dramatically lower your blood pressure. Long a feature of Nordic diets, you can find lingonberry products in Ikea, Lidl and health food stores.

But when it comes to a health boost, all berries pack a powerful punch — and have some rather surprising benefits . . .

Berry nice! From strawberries to Scandinavian lingonberry - a dark red soft fruit that's the latest on the block- berries are super health foods

BLUEBERRIES FOR STRONG BONESBlueberries have one of the highest antioxidant contents of  any fruit so they’re great for protecting against heart disease and cancer.

But one lesser known benefit is that they strengthen the skeleton.

A study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research found that a blueberry-rich diet could help develop bone mass. 

The researchers concluded that compounds called polyphenols (the pigments that give blueberries their colour) appear to stimulate bone cell growth.

A second study suggests blueberries could even help prevent loss in bone mass after the menopause.

STRAWBERRIES FOR YOUR BOWELMake the most of that bowl of strawberries and cream this summer. Not only do strawberries contain more vitamin C than oranges, they are also one of the best cures for constipation.

The high fibre content of the fruit is known to help  improve our bowel function.

And unlike prunes, which can have the opposite effect if you’re not properly hydrated, strawberries are 92 per cent water.

The seeds (around 200 in every berry) sweep through the gut undigested, helping to clean the gut wall and promote colorectal health.

BLACKBERRIES FOR YOUR MEMORYThis berry doesn’t just liven up apple pie — it can stimulate brain cells, too. An animal study found blackberry extracts improved balance, co-ordination and memory.

The researchers concluded this may be down to the fruit’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Research by the U.S. Human Nutrition Research Center on Ageing even suggests the polyphenols in dark berries improve cognitive function by helping to remove the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain, perhaps protecting against Alzheimer’s.

REDCURRANTS FOR BLOOD PRESSUREA CUP of redcurrants contains 308mg of the recommended 2,000mg of potassium you need each day. Potassium is vital to regulate blood pressure and is important for muscles and bones. A deficiency could result in muscle cramps, weakness and an irregular heartbeat.

GOJIS FOR ENERGYThis Himalayan berry, available at larger supermarkets and health food shops, contains more beta- carotene than carrots (making it excellent for eye health).

Its iron  content (7.6mg per 100g) also far outweighs that of steak (3.7mg) and spinach (2.7mg) combined.

Iron is needed to form haemaglobin, the red pigment in blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen round the body, so a lack of iron  can  lead to low energy levels and anaemia.

The figures from the Department of Health show a third of women eat so little iron that it is affecting their health — sprinkle goji on your muesli and you won’t be one of them.

From gojis being great for boosting energy to strawberries being packed with Vitamin C, berries really do pack a punch

ACAI BERRIES FOR YOUR LOOKSCONTAINING double the antioxidants of blueberries, it’s hardly surprising ‘the beauty berry’, as it has been  dubbed in its native Brazil, is renowned for its anti-ageing benefits.

One study by Emory University School of Medicine in the U.S. found fruit flies lived three times longer if they were given acai supplements compared with a control group.

It’s likely this is down to anthocyanins in the fruit — these help protect cells from damage by cancer-causing free radical molecules that occur naturally in the body.

British blueberry production has grown by 482 per cent since 2008

The berry is also rich in amino acids and omega fatty acids, which boost hair, skin and nails.

RASPBERRIES FOR HEALTHY JOINTSAlmost as potent as blueberries when it comes to their antioxidant content, raspberries are also known to have powerful anti-inflammatory properties. It is thought these stem from anthocyanins, the pigments that give the berries their vivid colour.

In animal studies, raspberry extract was found to reduce inflammation, cartilage damage and bone loss, making it a promising treatment for arthritis.

CRANBERRIES FOR  A HAPPY TUMThese sharp-tasting berries have long been known to promote a healthy bladder, thanks to compounds called proanthocyanidins, which stop E.coli bacteria from attaching to the bladder wall.

New research indicates, however, that the trusty cystitis buster could also help fight off H.pylori, a bacteria associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.

In one study of women being treated for H.pylori infection, those who were given cranberry juice alongside the usual medication were more likely to be free from the infection at the end of the study.
