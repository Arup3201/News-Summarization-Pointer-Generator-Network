Passengers on a late-night train service were treated to an impromptu concert when a man stood up and started a sing-song. 

The unidentified man attracted awkward stares from passengers travelling on the 12.07am service from London Victoria towards Ashford International, Kent, on Friday night when he stepped into the aisle.

But within minutes the group of around 50 people in the carriage were joining in chorus.

At first he began singing a collection of random words, getting his fellow passengers to repeat after him.

He then found a conductor's hat and began a rendition of Side by Side, a standard written by Gus Kahn and Harry M Woods in 1927.

Even when the man got off the train, the passengers were in such good spirits they began their own rendition of Oasis’ Wonderwall to pass the remaining minutes of their journey.

Passenger George Haswell, 24, filmed the whole episode on the 12.07am service.

The quantity surveyor, who was heading home to Maidstone after a work night out, said: 'It was so funny and entertaining. He was so amazing.

Attire: After the first song, he then found a hat and began a rendition of Side by Side

Dance: His first song was a collection of random words which he got passengers on the Southeastern Train service to repeat

'He was loving it. He put the whole carriage in such a good mood.

'After
 he got off there were still around 50 people in great spirits. One 
person started singing Wonderwall and everyone joined in.

'We were singing along for the rest of the journey.'

A Southeastern spokeswoman said: 'What a fantastic video! It’s great to see our passengers having so much fun during their late night journey and really getting into the spirit of the sing-a-long led by their fellow passenger.

'We applaud him for his enthusiasm and think he deserves a big pat on the back for his efforts. Clearly there’s some top singing talent among our customers.'

Side by Side has become a popular standard which has been performed by a number or artists.

The most notable was in 1953 when pop and jazz singer Kay Starr released a version.

It was also sung by Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello on the movie soundtrack for Hudson Hawk.

Chorus line: At points, the man grabbed people from their seats and got them to join him in the aisle

Movements: Unidentified singer made gestures with his hands to keep the crowd entertained

Put your hands together: Passenger George Haswell, 24, who was heading home to Maidstone after a work night out, filmed the whole episode
