Wayne Rooney is now fighting for his place as England head coach Roy Hodgson prepares to play him on the left wing against Ecuador.

Rooney played in his preferred position off the main striker in Friday’s 3-0 victory over Peru at Wembley, but Hodgson is preparing another experiment in Miami’s Sun Life Stadium.

Rooney, who missed the final three games of the season with Manchester United, is determined to prove he is one of the best players in the world in Brazil this month.

Hodgson said: ‘I’m not saying if he’s exceptional or not. I have picked him because he is a very good player.

‘I
 am only prepared to talk about Wayne Rooney as one member of my squad 
and a player who I hope will help us have a good World Cup.

‘If
 I say yes he is exceptional or no I don’t think he is exceptional then 
I’m wrong either way. There is a real obsession with Wayne which I don’t
 necessarily share. You always relate back to World Cups in the past, 
but Wayne is one of my 23 players.

‘I’m very happy to have him here. I don’t share the obsession that he has to play this or has to play that.

‘As
 far as I’m concerned I look at the players at my disposal and decide 
what they need and what we need. Then I expect them do it.’

Rooney
 is desperate to figure among the stars at this World Cup after failing 
to make an impact in 2006 in Germany and 2010 in South Africa.

The
 England forward has yet to score at the tournament and has been working
 hard on his fitness to make sure he is in peak condition by the time 
the team face Italy on June 14.

Hodgson
 appeared increasingly perturbed over finding a role for him in the side
 and he is the only starter from Friday’s 3-0 victory against Peru at 
Wembley selected here.
