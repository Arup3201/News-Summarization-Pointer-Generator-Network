A senior judge has issued a stark warning to lesbians about the dangers of fathering children using donated sperm.

Mr Justice Peter Jackson became the latest senior legal figure to express fears over unregulated artificial conception after ruling in a bitter battle between a separated couple over access to their six-month-old baby.

The High Court judge said the case was ‘one more example of the painful legal confusion’ that arises when lesbians have children without considering all the consequences.

Landmark ruling: A woman, who cannot be named, has been ruled the 'psychological parent' of the baby she and her partner conceived using sperm from a donor they met online

He spoke out after hearing a case involving two women, one English and one Irish, who had been in a relationship for about 18 months.

They had decided to have a baby together and the English woman had used a syringe to inseminate her partner with sperm from a donor they found on the internet.

The Irish woman, who is in her mid-30s, gave birth in October and the couple lived together in England and jointly looked after the girl, with the English woman even breastfeeding her when her natural mother fell ill.

But the couple’s relationship was ‘fraught with difficulties’ and they separated.

The judge said that in January, when their daughter was two months old, the Irish woman had taken  the child from the arms of her ‘protesting’ partner and moved back  to her native country.

He said the ‘extremely distressed’ English woman, who is in her mid-40s, was fighting for contact with the child, but as she was not the biological parent she had limited legal rights.

In his ruling, delivered after a private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, Sir Peter concluded that the baby’s ‘removal’ to Ireland was lawful and an English court did not have jurisdiction.

Legal rights: Same-sex couples who conceive at home rather than a clinic are not both legally granted parental status. The non-birth mother must file for adoption (file image)

But he also said that at the time  the girl was taken to Ireland, ‘family life’, as defined in the European Convention on Human Rights, had existed between the baby and the English woman.

He also quoted Mrs Justice Eleanor King describing a similar case as ‘a valuable cautionary tale of the serious legal and practical difficulties that can arise where men or women, desperate for a child of their own, enter into informal arrangements.’

Experts said such cases were likely to increase as the nature of families in Britain changed.

Solicitor Hannah Cornish, a family law expert at Slater and Gordon, said: ‘The couple needed to make an application to the court to protect the parental rights of the woman who was not the biological mother as soon as the child was born.

‘But they just didn’t address it, and unfortunately, when everything is going well, people don’t automatically think about the legal implications. I think these sorts of scenarios are going to increase as the nature of the family changes.’
