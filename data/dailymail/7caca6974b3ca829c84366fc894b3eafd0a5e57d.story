An old Etonian who spent more than £11.5million on a seaside village revealed today that he bought the 728-acre estate after feeling a sense of ‘freedom and an independence’ there.

Nicholas Johnston - a friend of Prime Minister David Cameron - managed to convince his wife Linda that he should buy Bantham in Devon after she initially thought it was a ‘hare-brained mad scheme’.

He fought off a rival bid from the National Trust to buy the estate - which features a golf course, shop, beach and about 20 homes - and hopes his children will one day take it on as a lifelong project.

Mr Johnston, 42, who is father to a nine-year-old daughter and twin boys aged seven, said the village is ‘blissful’ - and hopes his children can be part of it ‘for potentially the rest of their lives as well’.

He told Sunday Telegraph journalist Edward Malnick: ‘I think there’s a freedom of being able to run around, a freedom of self-expression, a freedom of being in the water, which is wonderful for them.’

Mr Johnston believes he is a good fit for a new owner, adding: ‘I think that the public here, the tenants here, the employees here will benefit from having direct access to a specific owner.

‘The danger of the National Trust, or any other body like them, is that it does just become a museum curator’s situation and it is the man from Bristol with a clipboard.’

Mr Johnston, whose family already control the Great Tew Estate in Oxfordshire, said that his winning bid was ‘well in excess’ of the £11.5million guide price.

He had originally visited it in May while his children were away with his wife, after spotting that it was on sale. She was originally sceptical, but changed her mind when seeing it for herself, he said.

Mr Johnston hosts the annual Cornbury music festival at the Great Tew Estate, regularly attended by Mr Cameron and nicknamed 'Poshstock' for its moneyed attendees.

Until last month the identity of the Bantham estate's new owner had been shrouded in secrecy, with the sellers only speaking to deny rumours the buyer was a Russian oligarch or an investment firm.

The previous owner was Evans Estates, a 
family-owned company formed by the descendants of Lieutenant Commander 
Charles Evans who began buying up Bantham in 1918.
