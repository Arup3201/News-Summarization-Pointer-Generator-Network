A husband was today charged with killing his 20-year-old bride who was riding pillion passenger in a motorbike crash.

Aspiring novelist Ashley Fairley had been seated behind her husband 27-year-old Kristof when he allegedly lost control of the motorbike and it collided with a car.

Paramedics had tried to save Mrs Fairley but the young writer, who had only been married for five months, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Newlywed: Ashley Fairely, 20, died in a crash while riding pillion on a motorbike with her husband Kristof, 27 in Portsmouth, Hampshire

Her husband was arrested at the scene of the crash on a coastal road junction in Portsmouth, Hampshire and was later bailed.

Police today announced the prosecutors had decided to charge him with causing death 
by dangerous driving whilst unlicensed, disqualified and uninsured.

He is due to appear before magistrates in Portsmouth on Friday, April 4.

The couple, who lived in Portsmouth, were only married in August last year, just months before Mrs Fairley died on January 21 in the crash involving the green Kawasaki bike and a Ford Focus car.

Mrs Fairley, who had studied psychology at college, had her own online blog and was a keen writer, photographer and animal-lover, with an interest in paganism.

Her blog stated: 'I’m 20 years old and at the moment I’m on the verge of starting my own business, selling handmade wiccan items and supplies.

'I love books. I love to read and write and imagine.

'I’ve currently got a series of three completed novels under my belt that remain unpublished.'

One of her novels, called The Chosen Warrior, had been viewed many times online.

'Police have charged a man following a fatal road traffic collision in Portsmouth in January,' said a police spokesman.

'Kristof Martin Fairley, 27, of Portsmouth has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving.

'He was also charged with causing death by dangerous driving whilst unlicensed/disqualified/uninsured.

'Ashley Fairley, aged 20 years, died after the motorbike she was a pillion passenger on crashed.'

The spokesman added: 'Kristof Fairley was bailed to appear at Portsmouth magistrates court on April 4.'
