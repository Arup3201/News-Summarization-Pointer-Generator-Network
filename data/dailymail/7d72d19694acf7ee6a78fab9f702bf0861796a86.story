Sam Allardyce was mournful in tone after watching Andy Carroll hit the heights for the Hammers.

The West Ham boss said: ‘The technical ability of heading is lost in the game somewhat today. People don’t talk about the technical ability of meeting a ball at the right time to get it in the back of the net.’

His side have scored 12 headers this season — six more than Everton, who have the next highest tally.

Sakho back in the picture

Diafra Sakho was superb after coming off the bench to complete his return from a mysterious back injury suffered on international duty with Senegal. 

After scoring West Ham’s third — his eighth in all competitions this season — he lifted his shirt to reveal a tribute reading: ‘RIP Happy!’ It relates to his niece Amy, who died last week.

It says plenty about West Ham’s wonderful season that Swansea striker Wilfried Bony’s opening goal after 19 minutes yesterday was the first time the Hammers have trailed in a fixture at Upton Park since losing 3-1 against Southampton on August 30.

In that five-game run before facing the Welsh outfit they hosted Liverpool, Queens Park Rangers, Manchester City, Aston Villa and Newcastle.

Many Hammers make light work

They certainly share the wealth at West Ham — they can boast 12 different scorers in the Premier League this season.

That’s a marked difference to yesterday’s opponents Swansea, who have only had seven, led by Ivorian striker Wilfried Bony.

Bony or summer signing Gylfi Sigurdsson have either scored or created more than three-quarters of Swansea’s league goals this season (16 of 20).
