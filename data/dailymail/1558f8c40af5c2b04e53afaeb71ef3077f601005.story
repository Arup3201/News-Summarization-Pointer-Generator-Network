A San Antonio man has been arrested after he secretly filmed his co-workers using the restroom.

Ray De la Cruz, 44, accidentally caught himself on tape as he installed a video camera in a female bathroom at his workplace, police say.

In the video, he is seen wearing his name tag as he secured the iPod to a wall overlooking the toilet.

De la Cruz was arrested Monday night and released from the Bexar County Jail on Christmas Eve after he posted $10,000 bond.

According to an arrest affidavit, De la Cruz was confronted and fired by his boss after an employee found an iPod taped to a wall in a storage locker in front of a toilet on December 16.

The female coworker discovered the device after hearing it beep, the affidavit states.

Police say De la Cruz was identified in the footage by his name tag.

Two women that used that stall can also be seen on the video, according to the arrest affidavit.

The affidavit says the man initially denied the accusations.

De la Cruz was fired on the spot.

He has been charged with one count of improper photography.

If convicted he could face a sentence of up to two years in prison.

The name of De la Cruz's workplace is not known.
