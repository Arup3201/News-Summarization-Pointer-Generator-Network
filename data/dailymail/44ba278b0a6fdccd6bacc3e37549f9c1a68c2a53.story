Two women and a man were shot and killed in broad daylight Monday in what California investigators are calling a murder-suicide.

Officers in Selma, southeast of Fresno, responded to reports of shots fired at around 2.15pm Monday, only to discover a woman lying mortally wounded in the street.

Another fatally shot woman was found inside a home located near the intersection of Jasper and Peach streets. Both women died at the scene.

First victim: Witnesses said Jessica Cervantes, pictured here with her husband, was gunned down in the street after getting into an argument with Johana Loza's boyfriend 

Selma Police Chief Greg Garner says the suspected gunman was also found in the house with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was taken to Community Regional Medical Center, where he died a short time later.

Garner says a motive hasn't been determined, but there may have been a conversation about money.

The chief says there were a number of witnesses at the scene and half a dozen people in the house at the time of the shooting, among them children. 

While police have not officially named the two victims and the gunman, Felipe Loza told the Fresno Bee that his 36-year-old sister, Johana Loza, was shot dead by her boyfriend of 19 years, Eduardo Escobar, who also killed the woman's cousin, Jessica Cervantes.

Motive: Police say there may have been a conversation about money between one of the victims and the shooter before gunfire erupted 

Mr Loza said his sister, a mother of seven originally from Michoacán, Mexico, had left Escobar about a week ago and went to live with her parents and grandparents in Selma.

An eyewitness described how just after 2pm, a Cadillac Escalade pulled up in front to the Loza family's home and Eduardo Escobar emerged from the vehicle.

Jessica Cervantes, who happened to be outside at the time, confronted Escobar and had a heated exchange with him, prompting the man to open fire on her, leaving the woman dead in the middle of the street.

Escobar then allegedly entered the house and shot his estranged girlfriend before turning the murder weapon on himself. 

The neighbor who witnessed the shooting and called 911 peered inside the Escalade and found Escobar and Loza's young child, who was unharmed.

Escobar and Loza’s teenage daughter took to Facebook Monday night to mourn her mother, expressing her love for the matriarch and promising the deceased woman to help take care of her siblings, including a baby brother.

In an earlier post, the girl confirmed that her mother did not make it, adding, 'I hope my dad doesn't make it either.'

According to her Facebook page, Jessica Cervantes is survived by her husband and their young daughter.
