Whatever feint hopes Nottingham Forest might have held of a late charge on the play-off spots were dealt a hammer blow, as The Reds were crushed 3-1 by Norwich City, who themselves could yet secure automatic promotion.  

Goals from Jonny Howson, Cameron Jerome and Wes Hoolahan gave Norwich a 3-0 lead within the hour, before winger Chris Burke grabbed a consolation for Forest on 76 minutes.  

Meanwhile, an own goal from Blackburn Rovers' Matthew Kilgallon gifted Brighton a 1-0 win at Ewood Park, as Chris Hughton's men moved one step further away from relegation.

Elsewhere, Charlton edged Reading 3-2 in a thrilling encounter at The Valley. Pavel Pogrebnyak had opened the scoring for the visitors but saw his effort canceled out by a Yoni Buyens brace and a goal from Simon Church. Pogrebnyak then grabbed another goal for The Royals, but it proved too late to salvage even a point. 

It was a nightmare for Huddersfield Town at the John Smith's stadium as Nahki Wells missed two penalties for the home side against Fulham. A goal on two minutes from Alex Kacaniklic put the Cottagers ahead early on before the the three points were confirmed by a 90th minute strike from Seko Fofana. The result sees Fulham move up to 20th in the league table, eight points clear of the drop zone. 

Bottom of the table Blackpool drew with Leeds United following a tumultuous week for the club that had seen public protests from supporters. Gary Madine put the hosts in front with a diving header before Mirco Antenucci equalised for Leeds.

In Wales, Cardiff City claimed a first home win since January as two second-half goals from Kevin Doyle and Peter Whittingham saw off a poor Birmingham City side. 

Wigan kept their hopes of survival alive with a dramatic 1-1 draw against Bolton. Substitute Martyn Waghorn grabbed the equaliser with a stunning overhead kick after teenager Tom Walker had given Wanderers the lead. 

Finally, Rotherham United suffered a 3-2 loss at home to Sheffield Wednesday. Goals from Ben Pringle and Jordan Bowery had canceled out Caolan Lavery's 86th minute strike for The Owls and United were 2-1 up. But a late flurry from the visitors saw them score twice in injury time through Atdhe Nuhiu and Kieran Lee.
