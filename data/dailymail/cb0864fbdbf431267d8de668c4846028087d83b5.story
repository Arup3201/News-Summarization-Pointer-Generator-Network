High street stores are set to enjoy bumper sales today as shoppers try to grab a festive bargain and avoid the chaos of online order deliveries.

Around £40billion of sales are expected in the run-up to Christmas – and today is predicted to be one of the busiest days, on what some have dubbed White Saturday.

The continuing discounts are thought to be a key factor, while the delivery problems for online orders mean many shoppers are likely to brave the cold and pick up presents the old-fashioned way to make sure they have them in time for Christmas.

In fact, industry experts said the weather itself could well be a factor in the sales surge, despite the Met Office issuing an ice warning to many areas. 

Matthew Hopkinson, of retail analysts the Local Data Company, said people shop on the high street for the ‘experience’, adding: ‘The colder weather makes people feel more festive.’ 

Today’s so-called White Saturday follows the trend of certain days being marked out for high retail sales – such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

An estimated £810million was spent online on Black Friday a fortnight ago – which was 50 per cent higher than expected and put a vast strain on delivery systems.

Retail analyst Patrick O’Brien from Verdict said the problem with online deliveries had been ‘very damaging’.

He added: ‘The amount of publicity you are seeing due to this problem will definitely cause concern, in terms of people not wanting to take the risk online.’

The Christmas period is crucial for the high street, with retail sales totalling £41billion last December. 

The British Retail Consortium predicts that Christmas food sales are likely to peak just three days before Christmas, on Monday December 22.
