Sir John Major yesterday warned Tory rebels not to commit ‘regicide’ by getting rid of David Cameron.The former prime minister said it was ‘inevitable’ that Mr Cameron would have critics in the party after more than two years in power.

But he told disgruntled Tory backbenchers that in-fighting would cost the party votes at the next general election.

Disaffected MPs from across the party are said to be plotting to oust the Prime Minister. Up to 14 have reportedly written letters demanding his resignation and are canvassing colleagues to do the same.

They are furious that faithful ministers and whips were sacked without explanation in the recent reshuffle.

Former Army colonel Patrick Mercer was yesterday named as one of the rebels who have written to Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee.

A leadership contest would be triggered if more than 46 MPs followed his example.

One MP said: ‘A lot of people feel we have reached the crucial tipping point. I think the plot is credible.’

But Sir John said: ‘I would have 
thought that if the Conservative Party has learned anything in the last 
20 years, it’s that regicide is not a good idea.

‘My message to them is: Look at history. Disunity costs votes, unity helps a government achieve the changes in our economy that we wish to see – that’s good for the nation, good for the economy, good for them, and good for the next election.’

Sir John took over the Tory leadership in 1990 after Margaret Thatcher was challenged by Michael Heseltine.

When the PM pulled out of the contest, Mr Heseltine failed to get enough votes and Mr Major won on the second ballot.

In 1995, he was nearly a victim of the Tory Right when he resigned the leadership to stage a ‘back me or sack me’ contest. Former Tory leader William Hague once remarked that the Conservative Party operated like an ‘absolute monarchy, moderated by regicide’.

Some rebels are said to want London Mayor Boris Johnson as PM. Sir John praised him as an ‘attractive’ politician, but added: ‘Boris isn’t in Parliament. Boris hasn’t said he wishes to become prime minister – quite the reverse.

‘The belief that suddenly everything is going to change – you’re going to have a leadership challenge and you’re going to have a replacement of the prime minister – I think isn’t in the real world.’

Former defence secretary Liam Fox urged the party to ‘fall behind’ Mr Cameron, quashing reports that he was plotting against the PM.

Dr Fox, who is popular with the party Right, said: ‘We have a very good Prime Minister, we have a very good leadership in the party – we need to fall behind it.

We need a robust debate, but having a robust debate is not the same as undermining the leadership.’

It emerged yesterday that US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was mocked by Mr Cameron for suggesting the London Olympics would be a failure.

Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein said Mr Cameron derided gaffe-prone Mr Romney, adding: ‘I witnessed David Cameron saying Mitt Romney had that unique distinction of uniting all of England against him.’
