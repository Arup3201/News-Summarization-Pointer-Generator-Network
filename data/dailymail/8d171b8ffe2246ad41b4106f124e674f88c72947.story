Tempestuous relationship: Ashley and Rob Morrison seen here in 2008 in New York City are still together - despite Mr. Morrison's guilty plea for domestic assault, which he was cleared of today in a Connecticut court when the charges were dropped

Rob Morrison, the former New York City CBS anchorman forced to quit his $300,000 a year job after he was arrested for choking his wife walked away from court on Thursday with all charges dropped.

Morrison, who is still married to former CBS MoneyWatch anchor Ashley Morrison was allowed to withdraw his previous guilty plea for the assault after completing a domestic violence program.

Appearing in a Connecticut court after completing the 26-week program following the February 2013 incident, Morrison said that, 'I feel like it's a clean start.'

Morrison was joined in court briefly by his wife of 11-years, who left him last year after he was accused of strangling her in a drunken argument in the early hours of the morning.

Outside the courtroom Morrison said, 'I am obviously very happy this day has finally come. In the 14 months since this happened I have experienced an amazing amount of personal growth. For something that started out quite negatively, it transformed into something quite positive.'

Morrison confirmed he was still with his wife, with whom he has an eight-year-old son and said that he is glad is family is 'intact' and that he felt positive for the future.

He admitted that he acted badly the night police arrived at his Connecticut home and apologized for his actions.

'My behavior was reprehensible,' he said according to the Stamford Advocate.

Police were called to the Morrison's $1.26 million Darien home at 1.30 am on February 17, 2013 after a phone called from Rob Morrison's mother-in-law that reported an incident of domestic violence at the house.

According to Darien police, Morrison had acted violently towards his wife that evening and ended up choking her with both hands.

Officers called to the house said that they witnessed red marks on Ashley Morrison's neck.

Arresting officer, Patrick Clohessy said that Morrison, 'threatened that if he was released from police custody, he would kill his wife,' according to note taken down after the arrest and filed in court as evidence.

A source who spoke to the Stamford Advocate said that the dispute began after they got into a fight over Facebook picture updates.

The source claimed that Morrison said he wife hit him and that he sent pictures of his wounds to her parents to show them and to get them to calm down his wife.

Ashley Morrison was not arrested nor charged with any crime after the disturbance.

However, Morrison's mugshot released by the Darien Police Department did show a cut and blood on his nose bridge and a bruise on his jaw.

However, following his initial guilty plea, Morrison began spending time with his family at Greenwich Water Club, Connecticut.

According to the NY Post, one member of the club reported seeing the ex-Marine help a child in the pool who had got a bloody nose.
