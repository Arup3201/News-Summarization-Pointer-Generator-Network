It is an astonishing view of Manhattan, showing Central Park and its surrounding skyscrapers from a unique perspective.

The astonishing image, which has just won a prestigious photography award, was created from a 360-degree panorama that lets you tour one of the world's most impressive cities and zoom into tiny detail - all from the comfort of your computer.

The breathtaking image and its accompanying panorama was created by Sergey Semenov of Russia.

Birds-eye view: The front page of the interactive tour, stitched together using thousands of images, shows Manhattan from the sky and allows you to zoom in to almost any part of the island

It was made using thousands of photographs of the city stitched together from helicopter tours during summer 2011.

This was then electronically 'flattened' to create the 2D image that won Semenov the best amateur award from the International Pano Awards, a contest for panoramic photographers.

'I shoot landscapes, spheres from helicopter, gig-pixel panoramas as well as manipulate Photoshop and prepare the photos to be printed in a huge size and organize photo-exhibitions,' Semonov wrote of his work at AirPano, a panoramic picture site, which led to the image.

‘My first conscious 
acquaintance with photography happened in 2003 when a 1.3 Mp digital 
simple hand-held camera appeared in my hands,' Sergey said.

'I was highly impressed by the ability to view the results on the screen!

'After that I became a fan of photography and gave it all my free time.

'Although I graduated from University with an honors degree in the sphere of International Economy and I am still working at that sphere as a consultant, photography took my heart forever.’

Craig Heckenberg, Business Unit Manager at Epson Australia, who organise the contest, said: ‘It’s great to see such incredibly creative photography and the truly outstanding images that are entered each year in the EPSON International Pano Awards.

The overall winner of the Open Competition was Craig Bill of the USA with his stunning image of an intense storm over the Texas-New Mexico border, called ¿Tempest¿

Mr Bill said: 'I set up my camera with the lens manually at infinite focus, and zoomed all the way to the horizon.

'If the storm had been any further away, my zoom would have given out. 

'I
 noticed the lightning bursts were every ten to twenty seconds.  I used 
the 'Bulb' setting for manual shutter release and remotely began 
opening, counting to around twenty and then closing the shutter. 

Any lightning caught in that time frame signaled me to stop the exposure and start another. 

The awards have produced a series of stunning images.

The overall winner of the Open Competition was Craig Bill of the USA with his stunning image of an intense storm over the Texas-New Mexico border, called ‘Tempest’.

The image was taken over a two hours time span - although most of the image, the storm and lightning, took only fifteen to twenty minutes to catch.

‘Every once in a while, I get away for a night by camping at one of my favorite quick getaway spots,' said Mr Bill.

'This night I decided to drive an hour to camp at a little group of sand dunes on the New Mexico - Texas border. 

'As I was driving, I did notice some small local thunderstorms forming in the distance.

'This storm was not all that big, but it made up for it in intense electrical energy and light that was just incredible.’

‘I set up my camera but did not think that much would come of the images because most lightning photos in the past just lacked timing, shape, composition, and drama. 

'I was in luck, as this storm was highly concentrated so that the lightning was not all over the sky, but in a very specific area. 

After about an hour, the storm lost its gusto and disintegrated while others in the distance gained strength.’

Peter Blakeman of Australia was the runner-up in the Open competition, with his clever use of movement in a panorama with his image of the 2010 World Cup Track Cycling in Melbourne, Australia.

Peter recalls, ‘After being told my accreditation did not include the Velodrome trackside because I was not with the Top Agency, I had no choice to search for a better image.

'I am never too impressed when I am excluded from areas even though I am accredited media.

'This image came about by standing in a position once again unavailable to media however I managed to get a few shots before being requested to move on. 

'In my imagery I try to combine action, plus art to create a sport image like no other.’

Anita Erdmann of Canada was the runner-up in the Amateur competition, with her beautiful and gentle image of Yellowstone National Park covered in snow

Anita Erdmann of Canada was the runner-up in the Amateur competition, with her beautiful and gentle image of Yellowstone National Park covered in snow.

Anita said:’ The image of, ‘The Lone Tree, Yellowstone’, was taken on a cold, wintery, March morning at Canyon Junction in Yellowstone National Park.   This was our first morning in Yellowstone National Park, our small group of photographers were the only people in that part of the park that morning.

'Yellowstone is so isolated and untouched during the winter months that it can feel like you are completely alone. 

'We were surrounded by pristine, untouched snow and in the distance was a solitary tree on the hillside, surviving another harsh winter. 

'I was inspired to photograph this lone tree, for it is just one example of how resilient and beautiful our untouched natural places can be.

Eric
 says, ‘‘The Chase’ was born out of a desire to create something that 
would not only push the boundaries of the type and quality of 360/VR 
work being done, but also challenge my own photographic and retouching 
skill sets.'
