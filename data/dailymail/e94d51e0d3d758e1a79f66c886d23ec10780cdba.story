Helicopter gunships have opened fire on civilians in Syria, activists claimed, as the brutal crackdown on Homs rebels continued for a 25th day.

The aircraft have flown over the beseiged Baba Amro region of Homs for the last two days - but it was the first time they attacked today.

The rebel stronghold also faced heavy shelling as elite government troops tried to recapture it.

Helicopters opening fire have raised fears that there could be a full ground invasion, CNN reported.

There were at least 23 deaths today, 
including 11 in Homs, as the UN said over 7,500 people have been killed 
in the Syrian uprisings.

In Homs the Farouq Brigade of the Free 
Syrian Army was trying to hold off the assault led by units of the 
armoured Fourth Division, commanded by Maher Assad, the hardline brother
of President Bashar.

Russia have upgraded a surveillance station based in Syria so that they will know if Israel attempts to attack Iran.

The Russians are allies of Syria and recently used their United Nations veto to block a resolution condemning the crackdown on violence.

The upgraded base - which now has new technology and extra staff- will now be able to monitor air traffic across the whole of Israel, the Washington Times reported.

Previously it was only able to detect military movements in the north of Israel, as far south as Tel-Aviv.

Now the radar also extends across Jordan and northern Saudi Arabia.

Russia have based the radar system on top of a hill in southern Damascus.

Ahmed, an activist who said he had just left Baba Amro, said the rebels in Homs will fight until the last man.

'We call on all Syrians in other 
cities to move and do something to lift the pressure off Baba Amro and 
Homs. They should act quickly,' he added.

He also revealed that Homs, a symbol of opposition to Assad in a nearly year-long revolt, was without power or telephone links.

The UN said almost 6,000 civilians and 1,500 army 
defectors have paid the price for trying to oust President Bashar Assad 
from power - with 2,000 of them killed in just the last eight weeks.

Troops
earlier today advanced on a key rebel-held area in the central city of 
Homs, where three Western journalists are still trapped by a government 
assault that has raged for weeks.

The forces appeared to be starting a ground operation to retake the area that has become a symbol of the uprising to oust the ruling regime.

Government forces have been heavily shelling Homs, and particularly the rebel-controlled Baba Amr neighbourhood, for more than three weeks with tanks, artillery and rockets.

The announcement by a Syrian official of the new troop advance indicated a ground assault was beginning to recapture Baba Amr. A Syrian official vowed Baba Amr would be 'cleaned' within hours.

Four
Western journalists - two of them wounded - had been trapped in Baba 
Amr since last week, when two other foreign reporters were killed there 
by a government attack.

Yesterday,Â 
Syrian rebels smuggled out Paul Conroy, one of the four journalists, 
and whisked him safely across the border into Lebanon.

Activists said 13 Syrians involved in the rescue operation were killed during it. The French government confirmed today that two French reporters remained trapped in Baba Amr, Edith Bouvier of Le Figaro and William Daniels.

Bouvier and Conroy were wounded last week in the same attack that killed American journalist Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik.

The French Foreign Ministry demanded 
that the Syrian regime ensure conditions that allow for the 'sure and 
rapid evacuation' of the two French journalists, 'notably through an 
immediate cease-fire in Baba Amr.'

'France
is mobilised to accomplish the priority evacuation of its two citizens 
blocked in Homs, in liaison with Syrian authorities,' as well as the Red
Cross and Red Crescent, ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said. He said
the government would not comment further for security reasons.

Spanish reporter Javier Espinosa, who works for the major Spanish daily El Mundo, also remained trapped in Baba Amr, El Mundo said today.

The paper said it had spoken briefly to him last night and he said he was 'ok'. The paper said it did not think Espinosa is injured and did not know where he is staying.

Troops also entered the central town of Halfaya in the province of Hama, near Homs, after five days of intense shelling, activists said.

They said the rebel-held town of Rastan, just north of Homs, was subjected to shelling and casualties were reported.

Also today, China urged world powers to provide humanitarian assistance to Syria, as Beijing tries to bolster diplomacy while continuing to oppose any armed outside intervention in the conflict.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi broached the idea of assistance in telephone conversations this week with the head of the Arab League and the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Algeria.

China defied Western powers and the 
Arab League by joining Russia to veto a U.N. resolution that outlined 
plans to end the conflict and condemned Assad's crackdown on 
anti-government forces.

China
was concerned the resolution would pave the way for the West to 
intervene and unseat an authoritarian government as it had in Libya.
