Nivin El Gamal arriving at the High Court, where it was accepted that an Islamic ceremony had taken place at the sheikh's Knightsbridge flat in January 2007 before an imam and witnesses

It's the stuff of little girls’ dreams. Fall madly in love with a rich prince, marry them and live happily ever after.

Unfortunately for former model Nivin El Gamal, real life didn’t follow the fairy-tale.

Yesterday at London’s High Court the acrimonious breakdown of her relationship with a member of Dubai’s ruling family was laid bare in excruciating detail.

She claimed that she secretly married Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum, one of the Middle East’s richest men with a £19billion fortune, in an Islamic ceremony in London four years ago.

He lavished gifts on her such as a Bulgari diamond-encrusted watch and large sums of money, and she went on to become pregnant with their child.

But when he had an official marriage with his royal cousin in 2008, she was unceremoniously dumped and Sheikh Ahmed denied they were ever in a relationship – calling her an ‘occasional sexual partner’.

Moreover he denied there was ever any ceremony and that the woman who claimed to be his ‘wife’ was no more than a ‘courtesan’ who attached herself to rich men to buy her things.

He even refused to recognise the 
paternity of their son, now three, until he took a DNA test under the 
pseudonym Robert Smith which confirmed he was his father.

Much to Miss El Gamal’s distress Sheikh Ahmed, 53, has never met his son, Saeed, nor officially recognised him as such.

Yesterday, in a ruling on their 
‘marriage’, Mr Justice Bodey accepted that the Islamic ceremony had 
taken place at the sheikh’s Knightsbridge flat in January 2007 before an
imam and two of the sheikh’s staff as witnesses.

But he ruled it could not be recognised in English law, therefore denying her the opportunity to seek any maintenance.

The judge also made it clear he was 
unhappy with the sheikh’s failure to attend court on Monday, as 
scheduled, because he was called to the Gulf Co-operation Council in 
Riyadh instead.

Egyptian
born Miss El Gamal, 35, had met Sheikh Ahmed, chairman of Emirates 
airline and sponsor of Arsenal Football Club, on a holiday to Dubai in 
2003.

As the uncle of 
Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Sheikh Ahmed is the
public face of ‘Dubai Inc’, the web of companies behind the state’s 
prosperity.

Miss El 
Gamal had said the pair took part in an urfi marriage – a traditional 
form of Islamic marriage that does not require an official contract – at
Sheikh Ahmed’s flat and that she had worn an Armani outfit as he had asked her to dress simply.

During such ceremonies the couple repeat the words ‘we got married’ and pledge their commitment before God.

Her lawyer Richard Todd QC had 
previously told the court that she was given a £30,000 dowry by Sheikh 
Ahmed and a further £3,000 to buy a wedding ring with 17 diamonds.

Miss
El Gamal had told Sheikh Ahmed: ‘I have no one in the world but you’, 
and had excitedly told friends that she was marrying the man she loved.

In
contrast his lawyers branded her a liar who invented the ‘marriage’ in 
an attempt to get £1million a year maintenance from him.

In
what her counsel Richard Todd QC described as ‘the case of the prince 
and the pauper’ she sought a declaration that her ‘marriage’ to the 
sheikh be declared null and void.

But
the sheikh’s counsel Martin Pointer QC claimed she was only an 
‘irregular’ sexual partner of the sheikh, a ‘courtesan’ who ‘had a 
fantasy that he would marry you’.

After
his paternity was established the sheikh agreed to pay substantial 
maintenance to Miss El Gamal and their son, who now live in a £3million 
property in central London.

Outside
court Miss El Gamal, who comes from a prominent family in Egyptian 
society, said: ‘I embarked on this nullity petition to get recognition 
of the fact that I went through a ceremony of marriage, a ceremony 
recognised as valid in Islam and thereby became his first wife.

‘I am delighted Mr Justice Bodey has rejected the hurtful assertion by the sheikh that there was no such marriage.

'I
recognise and have always recognised that although our marriage was 
valid as far as we were concerned, it was not capable of founding a 
petition for divorce in England; hence my petition for nullity.

‘I hope now that HRH Sheikh Al Maktoum will formally recognise his son as legitimate according to Islam.’
