A five-year-old boy has undergone extensive plastic surgery after his ear was bitten off when his neighbour's dog viciously mauled him a day before his birthday.

Kellen Cormie's ear was bitten off in the attack outside his Gold Coast home on Saturday and he suffered puncture wounds to his shoulder and abdomen where the dog latched on.

The large blue staffy that savaged the little boy  was put down on Monday afternoon after its owners surrendered it to Gold Coast City Council.

Kellen, who has been left traumatised by the incident, spent his birthday recovering in hospital with his twin brother Jake by his side. 

His mother Kay was getting the car ready to take the twins to pick up their birthday cake when Kellen ran next door to thank the neighbour for mowing their lawn.

'When my wife turned around Kellen's hand was already on the door. The dog barrelled the door open and came over the top of him,' his father, Scott, told Daily Mail Australia.

'He had him around the rib cage and the shoulder. The neighbour came out and just tried to get the dog off him by opening his jaw but (the dog) came back again.

'It wasn't just one bite, it was a full blown attack. He wanted to kill my son.'

Half of Kellen's ear was on the floor when the dog was eventually pulled away and the five-year-old was rushed to hospital for surgery.

'On the scale of dog attacks, the head surgeon said this was on the higher scale. The reality is there is no doubt he is going to lose part of his ear. He will have some disfigurement,' Mr Cormie said.

'Everyone is extremely traumatised. My son has to go back to the hospital on Thursday and he is bawling his eyes out already. He is having nightmares and he is very restless.'

The family now have to wait three weeks to learn if the operation to reattach his ear was successful. 

'We have to go back on Thursday and we're just preparing ourselves for what we'll see when they take the dressing off,' Mr Cormie said.

'Nothing can prepare us for it, we don't know what is going to be under there.'

Kellen and his twin Jake had been warned by their father about dangerous dogs before he was injured

Kellen and his twin Jake had been warned about dangerous dogs before, according to Mr Cormie.

'We have a dog ourselves, but that is the problem I think. The dog we have is gentle. You could step on him and he wouldn't bite you,' he said.

'My kids see this and think this is what dogs are like. I knew that dog was bad and I repeatedly told them to stay away from it.

'Even when Kellen came home from the hospital, he went straight over to our dog and started patting him saying he missed him.'

Kellen will start counselling on Tuesday to help with the trauma he experienced. 

'The dog being put down isn't going to save our son's ear, but at least we can come and go from our home without concern now. Kellen is not at risk any more,' Mr Cormie said.

Kellen's parents hope their son's accident can raise awareness about dangerous dogs. 

'If you have an aggressive dog, train it professionally,' Mr Cormie said.

'If that doesn't work, then tough decisions need to be made because they are a lethal weapon.'
