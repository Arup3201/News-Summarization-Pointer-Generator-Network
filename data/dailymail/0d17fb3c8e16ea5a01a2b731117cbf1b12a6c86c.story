Every new car could be connected to the internet by next year as billions of pounds are invested in creating the vehicles of the future, experts predict.

'Connected cars' will allow motorists to access the internet as they drive using only voice commands. 

Using similar technology to smart phones, it is believed cars could have internet screens displayed on dashboards by 2014.

Experts say the 'connected car' technology could actually make driving safer by stopping people using their phones in the car but allowing them information without needing to touch a button

It would mean people could find free parking spaces, access restaurant reviews of even be given a countdown of when traffic lights will change - without needing to touch a button.

Jack Bergquist, from information company IHS, told BBC: 'By the end of 2014, for some of the bigger brands, every vehicle they sell will offer some sort of connectivity.'

He said over half of drivers would be attracted to a car that had internet capability.

It could be especially popular as driving with hand-held phones was made illegal in the UK in 2003.

Mr Bergquist told the MailOnline that some brands such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes were already looking at offering full internet connections in their cars.

He cited Facebook as an example of how the technology could be used.

Facebook statuses or tweets on Twitter could be read out and then changed by the driver using a voice command.

He said that major brands are already spending as much as one third of their budget on in-car entertainment and technology.

Intel,
which has invested £64million over the next five years in the 'connected cars' say it is among the fastest growing technologies.

Self-driving and self-parking technology is already being used by many car brands

Only phones and tablets are growing faster, according to the BBC.

New advances in self-driving are regularly revealed.

Last month, Audi announced that its self driving technology could be commonplace within a decade.

The firm believes the cars could be capable of picking owners up from a shopping trip and then parking itself.

However, some people are concerned the more control that is taken away from the driver, the higher the safety risk.

According to the National Safety Council about 25 per cent of all crashes in the United States are caused by mobile phone use.

John Ellis, global technologist for connected services and solutions at Ford, was quoted in the BBC as saying: 'The danger is safety. You could get caught up your experience and forget that you're driving.'

He said people want safety to remain a priority of manufacturers.

But Mr Bergquist said this technology could actually reduce the number of crashes.

He said: 'I think it is actually a good thing. People are already using Facebook or crazy things like that [while driving]. The legislation does not stop 95 per cent of people using phones.

'You can't stop people from doing this but car manufacturers are able to create a system that is a million times safer than people updating Facebook on a phone in their laps.'
