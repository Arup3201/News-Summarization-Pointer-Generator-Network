Of all the great lines, in all the films, it all had to come down to a plastic spaceman.

According to a new poll, the greatest line in movie history is Buzz Lightyear’s catchphrase: ‘To infinity…and beyond!’

The public vote saw the line said by a toy astronaut in Disney’s 1995 film Toy Story come out top by just one vote.

'To infinity... and beyond!' Buzz Lightyear's famous quote has been voted the greatest line in movie histroy

This narrow margin gave it victory over Michael Caine’s line, ‘You’re only supposed to blow the bloody doors off’ from 1969’s The Italian Job. 

Third place went to ‘Say hello to my little friend’, screamed by Al Pacino in 1983’s Scarface.

The Radio Times vote is sure to split opinion, with only ten quotes chosen from an original shortlist of 50 and many favourites not included in the process at all.

Quotes that were chosen by the magazine to go to the public vote, but failed to attract enough support to make it into the final ten, include: ‘May the Force be with you’ from Star Wars and ‘Here’s looking at you, kid’ from Casablanca.

'I love the smell of napalm in the morning’ from Apocalypse Now, ‘Love means never having to say you’re sorry’ from Love Story and ‘The stuff that dreams are made of’ from The Maltese Falcon, were not even up for consideration.

'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy': The Life Of Brian quip, spoken by Brian's mother - played by Terry Jones - came in fourth in the top ten greatest movie quotes

Not even considered: Robert Duvall uttered the immortal line 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning,' in the Vietnam war classic Apocalypse Now, which didn't even feature in the Radio Times poll

Last out of the 50 was the famous line from Hitchcock’s thriller Psycho: ‘A boy’s best friend is his mother’, which picked up just one vote from the 2,500 cast in total.

The other famous lines in the top ten were ‘He’s not the Messiah. He’s a very naughty boy’ from Monty Python’s The Life of Brian which came in fourth. It was spoken by Brian’s mother, played by Terry Jones, and is one of a series of jokes in which Brian is mistaken for Jesus.

Next came ‘You’re going to need a bigger boat’ from Steven Spielberg’s Jaws and Gone with the Wind’s ‘Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn’.

Carry On Cleo’s: ‘Infamy, infamy, they’ve all got it in for me’ came in seventh, beating Blade Runner’s ‘All those moments will be lost in time… like tears in rain’.

‘Nobody’s perfect’ from Some Like It Hot and ‘We want the finest wines available to humanity. And we want them here, and we want them now’ from Withnail & I came ninth and tenth respectively. Just missing out was ‘Bond. James Bond’, first uttered in 1962’s Dr No by Sean Connery. 

Film critic Barry Norman, who worked with the magazine on the poll, revealed his favourite quote to be ‘Daddy! My Daddy!’ from the end of The Railway Children, claiming it ‘always brings a tear to my eye’.

However, even this didn’t make it onto the final list.

Mr Norman, who hosted the BBC’s The Film Programme from 1972 until 1998, said: ‘For me the power of words in films is just as great as that of visual images and helps to stamp the movie in my memory. 

'And certain lines have a potent effect on me, however many times I hear them. For instance, I have to confess that Jenny Agutter’s “Daddy! My Daddy!” at the end of The Railway Children always brings a tear to my eyes.’

He said the success of the Toy Story line suggests many younger cinemagoers voted and, ‘reflects the continuing popularity of films as emotional and intellectual entertainment’.

He added: ‘Therein, perhaps, lies a message for television programmers: the audience – or at least the thinking part of it, which I believe is greater than most programmers seem to acknowledge – is just as interested in the content and quality of the films themselves as they are in interviews with the stars’.
