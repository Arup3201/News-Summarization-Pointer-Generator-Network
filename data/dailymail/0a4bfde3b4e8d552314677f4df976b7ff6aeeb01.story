Pundits across the country are lambasting those who have treated the Trayvon Martin case as a means to exploiting other issues – especially the far right.

Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s Morning Joe was outraged that some extreme conservatives are treating the teen’s death as a means to pushing their own agendas.

‘This has nothing to do with gun rights. This has nothing to do with the Second Amendment,’ he said on Morning Joe today.

‘This has nothing to do with Stand Your Ground Laws…This has everything to do with a guy that’s trying to play security cop who was unhinged, who chased down and shot a 17-year-old kid, armed with Skittles and iced tea.’

Carpet-bagging: On Morning Joe, host Joe Scarborough said it's 'disgusting' that the right is using the Trayvon Martin case as a political platform

Blame game: William Bennett, who worked under George H.W. Bush, said people are trying to profit personally and politically from Martin's death

Scarborough condemned those on the right who, as he said, were using the case of Trayvon Martin to get ahead politically.

He said: ‘Some of these guys on the right are jumping in with both feet on the far right…they are trashing Trayvon Martin. It’s disgusting.’

But in a case where everyone from Spike Lee to President Obama have commented, it’s a difficult issue to navigate.

‘It’s innocuous at best,’ Scarborough said on the MSNBC show, labeling those trying to make Trayvon Martin’s death a political issue are ‘fools.’

Solidarity: Civilians and celebrities alike have jumped upon wearing hoodies to support Trayvon

Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly took the opposite stance, saying on The O’Reilly factor Thursday that pundits shouldn’t be so quick to pass judgment.

Arlene Holt Baker, who is the Executive Vice President for the American Federation of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organisations, said that ‘conservative, right-wing policies’ are to blame for Martin’s death.

Ms Baker told The Daily Caller that 
conservative think tank ALEC – the American Legislative Exchange Council
 – is to blame for Florida’s ‘Stand Your Ground’ law.

William Bennett cited the hysteria surrounding the case as a worrying symptom.

In a CNN editorial, the former George H.W. Bush staffer wrote that many seem eager to jump to conclusions.

Mr Bennett wrote: ‘Many people are not on an impartial hunt for justice, but are exploiting this crisis for personal or political gain and claiming that it is representative of larger societal problems.’

As the Christian Science Monitor noted, details of the case are being released slowly, and often in a point-counterpoint fashion.

Jumping to conclusions: Bill Bennett said that some people are using this case to add fuel to the fire, carpet-bagging any number of causes or issues

First, the funeral director who handled Trayvon’s body said there were no injuries that would suggest a fight. 

Next, Zimmerman’s brother Robert Zimmerman Jr. said he’s a stand-out man, and a ‘neighbour everyone would want to have.’

Mr Bennett said: ‘The people raising the most noise are trying to make this less about the horrible death of a young man and more about claims of racial resentment that may or may not exist.’

He pointed out that while Zimmerman may or may not be guilty, many are jumping to conclusions and carpet-bagging on a tragic incident.
