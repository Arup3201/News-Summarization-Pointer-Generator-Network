Explosive court papers reveal how Farrah Fawcett had an 11-year relationship with her college sweetheart behind the back of Ryan O’Neal up until her death.

A court battle over the ownership of an Andy Warhol portrait of the Charlie's Angel star have led to the revelation of intimate stories about the relationship that Fawcett was having with her college boyfriend while she was still seen in public with her longtime partner, Ryan O'Neal.

Former college football star Greg Lott was called to give a deposition in the lawsuit, saying that he was having a sexual relationship with the famous actress- who he called his 'girlfriend'- until she died from cancer in 2009.

Lott, a former football player, detailed their 'committed relationship' in the lengthy deposition, saying that they were 'exclusive' in spite of reports that she was romantically involved with the O'Neal at that time.

Secret lovers: Greg Lott claims that he was 'with' Farrah Fawcett in the last 11 years of her life and they were exclusive in their romantic relationship and now he has detailed their time in a deposition

Together: Fawcett's former boyfriend said that the Charlie's Angel star was no longer romantically linked to Ryan O'Neal after they formally broke up in 1997 (seen together at a party in 2004), but they clearly remained close until her death in 2009

Fawcett and O'Neal never married but dated from 1979 until 1997, and during that time they raised their son Redmond together.

Though they broke up more than a decade before her battle with cancer, O'Neal was a constant presence in Fawcett's life and has been heading up the dispute over the ownership of a Warhol portrait of Fawcett ever since.

Lott said that he and Fawcett had 'a sexual relationship' during the last decade of her life, and he was the only man in that capacity at that time.

'She saw no one else and I saw no one else but her,' Lott said in the deposition, according to Radar Online.

He went on to say that Fawcett rarely spoke with O'Neal while she was with Lott, with one point of exception.

'Yes, except for (their contact regarding) a dysfunctional son… He’s a drug addict,' Lott said of Redmond O'Neal.

His side: Lott says that Fawcett stayed close to O'Neal because of their son but he was the one having a relationship with her at the time of her death in 2009

Proof: Lott has offered this 2007-dated letter from Farrah as evidence of their relationship

Redmond has struggled with substance abuse and was temporarily released from jail in 2009 to visit his mother in shackles at the hospital and also was permitted to attend Farrah's funeral after she died of cancer at age 62.

'My understanding is he (Ryan O'Neal) claims that he was with her for 30 years. That discounts my 11-year relationship with her,' Lott said in the deposition.

Lott said that while O'Neal and Fawcett were photographed together as they 'would pick up her son at the gym or drop him off at the gym', Lott and Fawcett kept their public appearances to a minimum when they were together.

He said that they went to the movies a handful of times but other than that they wanted to avoid the glare of the public eye.

Lott explained the reasons saying: 'One was her child and the rest of it was because I didn’t want to be Mr. Fawcett in the media. We were famous together in college. We did not want to go through that again.'

Family unit: Ryan and Farrah were a couple from 1979 until 1997 and they raised their son Redmond together, but they remained close as all three are pictured at a premiere in 2003

Better times: Fawcett and O'Neal were seen as an unusual Hollywood couple in that they lasted for nearly two decades but never married

This isn't the first time that Lott has spoken publicly about his relationship with the star of Charlie's Angels.

Lott previously told The Mail On Sunday that he first met Farrah in the Sixties when she was, he says, ‘like a frisky palomino – all legs, teeth and spirit’.

The truth, he says, is that for the last 11 years of her life, Farrah was involved in a very private romance with him. ‘We were blind, crazy, in love,’ he says. ‘Farrah was my best friend and my inspiration.

'We fell in love with each other all those years ago and we never really stopped loving each other. Our lives took us in very different directions but, in the end, her heart always came home to me and Texas.’

In a series of startling revelations made to our newspaper, Lott claims that O’Neal froze him out of Farrah’s life against her will and that she referred to O’Neal as the ‘Fat F*** from the beach’.

Men left standing: Redmond (seen left with his father earlier this month) has been sober ever since leaving prison following a drug arrest. He was allowed to attend his mother's funeral in 2009 mid-sentence

Perhaps predictably, his claims have been greeted with anger by Ryan O’Neal, whose spokesman says they are ‘categorically false’.

Causing a stir: The deposition was given in relation to a lawsuit over an Andy Warhol silk screen of Fawcett that O'Neal is trying to take ownership of. This is a polaroid Warhol did in connection to that project

However, Ryan’s son Griffin from a 
different relationship says: ‘I have to thank Greg Lott for one thing: 
For loving Farrah the way she deserved to be loved. Ryan was just there 
for the acclaim.’

Lott says: ‘I last spoke to Farrah late on the night of April 9 – two-and-a-half months

before she died. She was preparing to come home from a bout of treatment at St John’s Hospital in Santa Monica.

She told me: “I’m coming home tomorrow. I love you and I will call you.”’

But Greg never heard from her again.

In desperation, he flew to California, to her home in LA, but, he claims, O’Neal refused him entry. He says: ‘I never got to say goodbye to Farrah. Ryan shut me out of her life.’

Now O’Neal is trying to make sure he gets control of one last piece of Fawcett, and this time it comes in the form of a painting.

Andy Warhol made two silk screens of Fawcett in 1980 and one of the originals was bequeathed to her alma mater of the University of Texas but O’Neal claims that it belongs to him. The trial is continues.
