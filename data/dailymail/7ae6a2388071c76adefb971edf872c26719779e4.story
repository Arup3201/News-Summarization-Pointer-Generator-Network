German soldiers march through central Paris, a World War II warzone scarred by Nazi occupation.

Although in these incredible images the streets are also full of modern day cars and tourists.

By pinpointing the exact locations of original photographs, Sergey Larenkov, is able to open a window into the past, revealing how troops and tanks once occupied the French capital.

Using a mixture of photography and computer editing skills, the Russian photographer is able to intertwine war era locations with modern day photographs, creating an eerie but fascinating effect.

Sergey said: 'I am always searching for the places pictured in the old postcards and photos any chance I get.

'The hardest part of my photography is locating the exact point and angle from which the original picture had been taken.

'By stitching the two images together I feel it has the ability to transport someone from a peaceful, modern life to the hardest times of the war period."

'The hardest part of my photography is locating the exact point and angle from which the original picture had been taken, it can be very difficult locating the place, getting to this place, making shot and then processing it.

'I can spend months perfecting one shot, but other times it only takes me about 30 minutes.

'My grandfather's fought the Nazis defending Leningrad and now they are gone, I feel like I must tell my own children what their ancestors had to overcome, the theme of these photographs are very personal to me.'
