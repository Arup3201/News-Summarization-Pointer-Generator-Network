President Barack Obama, who has struggled to live up to his rock star status of 2008, brought in some extra glamor to Las Vegas this time around in the form of singer Katy Perry, resplendent in a latex dress decorated with a ballot paper.

At a rally and concert that attracted 13,000 people, there were screams and squeals as the pop star opened with a rendition of Al Green's soul hit - and Obama favorite - 'Let's Stay Together' and performed five songs, including 'Teenage Dream' before finishing up with her hit 'Firework.'

On the screen behind her, images of Obama and his slogan 'Forward' were juxtaposed with pictures of Obama rallies, volunteers and supporters.

Perry urged the crowd to take heed of a large sign imploring: 'Vote Early.'

She said: 'Don't wait. Go tomorrow. How many of you are 18 here? It's going to be your first time, right?'

The dress, which was revealed when a male dancer pulled another outfit of her after the first song, had 'President of the United States' across her chest with a square box on her right hip filled in next to the names of Obama and Joe Biden.

Mitt Romney was on her left thigh and an empty box on her right.

There were long lines for the event and metal barriers gave way at one point as the crowd crushed against them.

The crowd eclipsed the 5,000 or so who turned up to see Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan in Las Vegas earlier this week.

Obama joked that Perry's elderly grandmother had nearly caused problems in his marriage.

'I've got to know Katy and she's a wonderful young lady,' he said. 'And I can tell that part of it is because of her outstanding grandma Anne, a 50-year resident of Nevada.

'The only thing I have to say is Anne got some lipstick on me when she kissed me. Fortunately somebody wiped it off before Michelle saw it.'

He laughed, adding: 'I'm telling you, you're going to get me in trouble.'

Obama sounded hoarse at times as he pleaded for people to vote. 'I believe in you. I need you to keep believing in me.' If they did, he said: 'We'll win Nevada again. We'll win this election. We'll finish what we started.’

Sensation: Perry performed five songs as well as a rendition of Al Green's soul hit - and Obama favorite - 'Let¿s Stay Together'

He said: 'I've come to Nevada to ask you for your vote. I've come to ask you to keep America moving forward.'

Obama blasted Romney for shifting positions, leading to the condition the Obama campaign has termed ‘Romnesia’. Obama said: 'There's a cure in Nevada. All you got to do is vote.'

He suggested that Romney could not be trusted. 'Trust matters,' he said. 'Who's going to look out for you? Nevada, you know me by now. You know I say what I mean and I mean what I say.'

There were cheers as he said: 'We are pulling an all-nighter. No sleep. And if you’re not going to sleep, you might as well be in Vegas.'

En route to the airport afterwards, he made a surprise visit to the Bellagio hotel and casino, where he greeted hundreds of workers crowded inside.

'Everyone here knows what it means to work hard,' he told them. 'You're what makes Las Vegas run. You’re what makes the strip run. I need you guys to go out and vote now. Don’t wait to vote. You're going to go cash in your chips now.’

Nevada was the third stop on a five-state, two-day tour which has taken Obama to Iowa and Colorado and will see him go through Florida and finally Virginia on Thursday.

Obama has been polling a few points 
ahead of Romney in Nevada, which he won comfortably in 2008, and has a 
slighter lead in Colorado.

Romney holds a slight edge in Florida, Virginia is even and Obama has a slim advantage in all-important Ohio.

The Republican challenger has held large rallies in Nevada, Iowa and Ohio.
