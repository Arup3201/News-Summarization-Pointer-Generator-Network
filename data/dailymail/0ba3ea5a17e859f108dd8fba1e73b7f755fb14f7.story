A Los Angeles police department patrol car struck and killed a man who was lying on his back in the street naked Sunday night.

Authorities believe the man was the same person the officers in the patrol car were searching for following a police report that someone was running nude in and out of traffic.

The collision took place in the Jefferson Park area southwest of downtown LA around 10:20 p.m., according to the LAPD.

The patrol car had its sirens blaring as the officers searched for the man, who hasn't been identified.

However, they had turned off the alert after they failed to locate him. 

About three blocks away from where witnesses reported him running in the street, he was struck by the patrol car.

He was lying flat on his back in the middle of the road, authorities said.

'Unfortunately before the officers could stop they ended up running over him and he was killed at the scene,' Detective Scott Walton said.

The man was white and aged between 50 and 60 years old, police said.

'We're trying to figure out why he was laying down in the road,' LAPD Officer Liliana Preciado said, according to the LA Times. She said his head was facing west and his feet were facing east in the road.

'The officers immediately stopped and rendered aid,' Preciado added.

Lt. Andy Neiman, a department spokesman, told Fox 11 authorities are trying to determine whether the man was mentally ill, on drugs or intoxicated.

The two officers inside the patrol car at the time of the crash will be given psychological counseling due to the accident.

Streets were blocked off in the area as police investigated the crash.
