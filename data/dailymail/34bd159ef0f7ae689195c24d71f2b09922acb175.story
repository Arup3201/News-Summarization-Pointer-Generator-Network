Joleon Lescott is undergoing a medical at West Bromwich Albion.

The former England defender returned from holiday and headed straight for the club's training ground to complete a series of fitness tests.

Albion are in pole position to sign the 31-year-old amid interest from Hull and Stoke, while Crystal Palace are also believed to have registered late interest.

Victor: Lescott won two Premier League titles during his time at Manchester City

New West Brom head coach Alan Irvine knows Lescott from their time together at Everton but admitted wage demands by the centre-back, available of a free after leaving Manchester City, could prove prohibitive.

Yet it is understood Lescott would be willing to reduce his salary from the Â£90,000-per-week he received at the Etihad to around Â£40-45,000 per week.

Negotiations still need to be completed but West Brom plan to offer Lescott what he wants.
