Princess Michael of Kent has written a series of novels about sexual intrigue and murder at a royal court based on the exploits of some of her ancestors.

The Princess, who married the Queen’s cousin Prince Michael of Kent in 1978, will lay bare the darkest secrets of her family in the ‘Anjou’ series of novels.

They chart the lives and loves of French kings, queens and aristocrats in the first half of the 15th Century.

She has spent the past seven years researching her family tree and the books will be published over the course of the next three years.

Princess Michael, 68, is already a published non-fiction author but was encouraged to try her hand  at historical fiction by her friend Philippa Gregory.

Gregory's bestselling novels The White Queen and The Other Boleyn Girl have been adapted for television and cinema.

The Princess’s publishers boast that she 
will use her ‘insider’s perspective’ of court life to enrich the story 
of arranged marriages, illicit affairs and warring princes.

The Queen Of Four Kingdoms, due out on 
October 17, charts the lives and loves of Yolande, the daughter of the 
King of Aragon, and her husband, Duke Louis II of Anjou –  the 
sixteen-times great-grandparents of the Princess.
