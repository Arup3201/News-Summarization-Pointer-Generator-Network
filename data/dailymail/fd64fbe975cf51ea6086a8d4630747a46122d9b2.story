Cast your mind back to June 27, 2010, the day England’s last World Cup adventure ended with that horribly familiar sense of crashing disappointment.

There had been little excitement in three group games against the United States, Algeria and Slovenia before the last 16 match ended up being memorable for two things – Frank Lampard being ludicrously denied a goal and Germany inflicting England’s heaviest defeat at a World Cup finals.

When England suffer a major setback, like that 4-1 dismantling in Bloemfontein, it impacts on the mood of the country. I was a member of Fabio Capello’s squad and we flew home from South Africa knowing, once again, the England team had let the nation down.

Crashing disappointment: Wayne Rooney reflects after the humiliating defeat by Germany

What a letdown: Jamie Carragher (right) was part of that England squad and admits they were poor

Big tournaments are a feast for football fanatics yet they also attract viewers who don’t tend to follow the national sport from week to week but are desperate for England to do well. Top class sport brings people together – success makes you feel good and lifts the atmosphere.

Think about it: we have been frequently treated during the past four years and, in the future, we may well look back at this period as being the best, most successful we have known in British sport. Just consider all the achievements.

Andy Murray has won Wimbledon and the US Open. Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome have each won the Tour de France. The British & Irish Lions were magical when winning in Australia 12 months ago, England’s cricketers, among other things, won the Ashes and the World Twenty20.

Carl Froch has put himself up with the finest boxers we have produced. Golfers Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose have won the US Open – one of them could repeat the feat this Sunday – and all three played their part in Europe’s extraordinary Ryder Cup victory in 2012.

All smiles: there is much more positivity around Rooney and the England camp this time around

That is without mentioning the wonderful show we put on for the world with the London Olympics, with the high point being that famous Saturday night when we all sat around our televisions screaming Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford on to gold medals.

I wouldn’t say for a moment that I tune into the above sports all the time. I don’t. I wouldn’t have a great interest in rugby union, for instance, but I was intoxicated by the Lions and I can’t wait for the World Cup next year. I love the drama of the big events and seeing British sportsmen succeeding.

So now the onus falls on the footballers to get the country bouncing. England may have travelled to Brazil with expectations being talked down but come Saturday night in Manaus, when the first ball is kicked and Group D gets underway, millions will be allowing themselves to dream.

After all, it has been too long since there was a buzz about England in a major tournament. You could argue there was when Wayne Rooney emerged at Euro 2004 or when Michael Owen exploded during France 1998 but I’d say Euro 96 was the last time the country came alive because of football.

Carrying the hopes: George North's memorable tackle on Israel Folau epitomised the detemination of the successful British & Irish Lions Down Under last year

We have underperformed for too long when you consider the amount of top class players who have been available. I’m not singling anyone out but we all – myself included – could have done better in tournaments in Japan, Portugal, Germany and South Africa.

But there was negativity about the England squad before a ball had even been kicked at the last two World Cups. In 2006, there was the furore of Sven Goran Eriksson of selecting Theo Walcott, then an uncapped 17-year-old who had not made his Arsenal debut, and headlines about WAGs.

Great Britons: Rooney and Co should take inspiration from the likes of Carl Froch (L) and Greg Rutherford (R)

Happy days: Alastair Cook and Graeme Swann brought joy to the nation when they celebrated Ashes glory over Australia in 2009

Silver lining: Justin Rose became the first Englishman in 43 years to win the US Open when he triumphed at Merion last year

Four years ago, things had gone the other way with Capello being criticised for getting too many thirty-somethings in at the last minute – I was one, Paul Scholes might have been another. There was also scepticism about the ‘military’ set up that had been chosen for our base in Sun City.

Using that as a reason for why England failed, however, is just an excuse. Quite simply, we were not good enough.

Halcyon days: Euro 96, which included this famous Paul Gascoigne goal celebration, was the last time England cam alive because of football

Will England be good enough to go all the way in Brazil? I don’t expect them to. Privately, I’m sure Roy Hodgson, his staff and players will feel the same but the World Cup can still be a success even if England do not contest the final next month.

The biggest thing Roy and the team can do is excite us; to get us hugging strangers in the pub and dancing around our living rooms because England have played with style and won the contests that matter. Hodgson’s reputation is not for being bold but as a nation we are willing him to be brave.

Let this be a tournament that features England moments we remember for the right reasons, like the 3-0 win over Poland in 1986 when Gary Lineker scored, David Platt’s volley against Belgium at Italia 90 and the thumping, Paul Gascoigne-inspired 2-0 win over Scotland at Euro 96. 

Thrill them: England need to get fans like the Rogers family from Leicester dancing around their living rooms

There is genuine hope with the squad Hodgson has selected England won’t end up dead on their feet in the knockout stages, hanging on for a draw and losing on penalties as was the case against Italy in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012.

Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson, Ross Barkley, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are all young players with technique but they can also run and their legs will be vital. Hopefully one or two of them – maybe Sterling and Barkley – will make a difference and get England off to a flying start in Manaus.

Should the worst happen and England fail to get out of their group, there will be more inquests and more negativity but youth gives hope for the future. If they take their chance, who knows where they will be in two years. The first objective, though, is to get the nation believing again.
