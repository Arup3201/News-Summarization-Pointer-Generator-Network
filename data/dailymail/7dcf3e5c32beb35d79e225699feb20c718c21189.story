BlackBerry customers using their new handset to share music and videos could end up revealing much more than they intended.

A setting on the new Q10 alerts your BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) contacts to which tracks you are enjoying - but will also inform them if you've been secretly using your smartphone to watch porn online.

BlackBerry Z10 customers flagged up the issue with the 'Show What I'm Listening To' feature, which is also built in to the newest Q10 model.

Over-sharing: A feature on the BlackBerry Q10, which was launched by actress and model Lily Cole today, has a feature that could alert your BBM contacts if you use it to watch porn

Black or white? The Q10 handset, which goes on sale in the UK next week and the US next month, will be available in two colours, and has both a physical keyboard and a small touchscreen

One customer posted a screenshot on the CrackBerry blog revealing how he was alerted to a friend viewing an adult site.

'Be very careful! LOL,' he added.

Another - who said 'that has happened
a lot of times to my contacts' - added that he'd had to tell his uncle 
what was happening because he was 'having "me time"', a report in The 
Sun said.

BlackBerry users can watch videos on the device's Media Player - the same platform it uses to play music.

Not so secret habit: Z10 users flagged up the issue with the feature, which is also built into the new Q10 handset, on the CrackBerry web forum

As a result, customers who choose to share what music they listen to with their contacts, will also share the videos they watch.

Should a customer decide to watch adult content on their Q10, their BBM contacts will know exactly which site they visited, and when.

BlackBerry has said the feature has 
to be switched on by the individual user, but some customers said it was
activated when they got their smartphone and that they had had disable the feature themselves.

The
Q10 will be available in the UK next week for £579, although is 
expected to be subsidised by major operators, and in the US next month.

Many
say the handset is Blackberry's last chance after the touchscreen 
version of the phone, called the Z10, failed to sell as well as the firm
hoped.

Blackberry has unveiled the phone it

competition - a QWERTY keyboard.

A delay in selling the new BlackBerry has derailed the firm's efforts to hang on to customers considering switching to the iPhone or a Google handset.

Although the BlackBerry has fallen behind rivals, many 'power' users have stayed loyal because they prefer a physical keyboard over the touch screen on the iPhone and most Android devices.

However, the initial reviews of the handset are not encouraging.

'Anyone who doesn't need a physical keyboard should skip it,' said Cnet, while Ars Technica said ' For most buyers, though, it's going to feel like a throwback, and we don't mean that in a good way.'

In the UK, Selfridges will exclusively launch the new and highly anticipated BlackBerry Q10 in all its stores and online on Friday 26th April.

In a European exclusive, Selfridges and Selfridges.com will be the only place in Europe to purchase the BlackBerry Q10, for £579.99, in store and online until Monday 29th, when it will then be available nationwide.

Julian Slim, Head of Home and Lifestyle at Selfridges said: 'Following the very successful Z10 launch we are thrilled to be hosting the European Exclusive of the highly anticipated BlackBerry Q10.

'This is the product all core BlackBerry users have been waiting for. We pride ourselves in being the destination for all the latest gadgets and technology and BlackBerry is no exception'.

Blackberry is bullish about the handset's chances.

'Built with precision and offering premium performance in a timeless design, the BlackBerry Q10 smartphone combines BlackBerry’s best physical keyboard and a touch screen with the power of the BlackBerry 10 platform,' it says.

BlackBerry chief executive Thorsten Heins believes the handsets will beat the iPhone, which makes up 38% of the installed base of smartphones in the US, against 5.9% for BlackBerry, Heins told the Associated Press agency that Apple lacked innovation and that the phone could not multitask:

'It's still the same,' Heins said of the iPhone.

'It is a sequential way to work and that's not what people want today anymore. They want multitasking.'

The Blackberry Q10, the handset experts hope will save the firm as it battles Apple and Google
