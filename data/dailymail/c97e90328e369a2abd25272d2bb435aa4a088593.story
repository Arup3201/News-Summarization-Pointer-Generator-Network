A video of an inspirational young woman with an uncontrollable urge to pull out her hair has attracted more than 5 million views.

Rebecca Brown, 21, from Chelmsford, Essex, blogs about life with trichotillomania and published a six-and-a-half year time-lapse video on her YouTube channel last year.

Extensive news coverage caused the views to soar by around 3 million in just a couple of weeks, and the comments section flood with fan mail.

Rebecca Brown, 21, from Chelmsford, Essex, blogs about life with trichotillomania

Whenever Rebecca was stressed or upset when she was growing up she would play with her hair for comfort.

By the time she was 16 her habit had escalated into a full-blown psychological disorder - which left her almost completely bald.

Doctors
 failed to diagnose the condition for five years, simply telling her to 
stop being a fidget. Meanwhile at school she endured cruel taunts and 
nasty looks from her classmates.  

Feeling lost and alone, she started 
taking a photograph of herself every day, chronicling her experiences on
 the internet in a blog and in YouTube videos with brutal honesty.

In her most-viewed clip she chronicles six-and-a-half years of her life with 2,100 selfies.

The four-minute video shows Rebecca in the depths of depression with 
sullen eyes and picking at her skin, and in the highs of health with a 
glowing complexion and a wide smile.

To
 her utter surprise the response was overwhelming - and to her delight 
it was supportive.

As a result of her videos, Rebecca, pictured in 2012, has a large group of fans and supporters

Her honestly and bravery is clearly inspiring, with comments such as this posted from a 
supporter: 'Wow I just watched this and it really touched me. Well 
done! You're an inspiration :) I hope you keep pushing forward and I 
wish you all the best!﻿'

For
 others, the video touched their lives in a much more personal way. A 
father whose daughter has the condition wrote: 'That's lovely, Becky! I 
just showed this to my 13 year old to let her see what kinds of changes 
are in store for her in the next seven years.' A fellow sufferer 
added: 'I have been suffering from the same nervous disorder for almost 
twenty years now. Words cannot express how I feel finding your video.  
Maybe that I am less alone.  Thank you for speaking out! <3'﻿

Rebecca has become a heroine to thousands of other sufferers of 
trichotillomania, a disorder characterised by the uncontrollable urge to
 pluck out the hair, usually from the scalp but also sometimes eyebrows 
and eyelashes.

And it must be taking up most of her time getting back to all these people. Back in November Rebecca confessed she receives so much fan mail 
online it takes her three hours a week to reply to it all - and that she was even 
mobbed by fans when she attended a conference on the condition in the 
US.

She said: ‘I get a lot of post from people who confide in me about their 
trichotillomania, yet they haven’t told their family or friends. I feel 
very blessed that people trust me like that.’

Rebecca played with hair obsessively as a child and began pulling out 
clumps when she was a teenager.

She said: ‘I started going to the doctor
 about it when I was 13 but they didn’t diagnose it until 18. Before I 
was diagnosed, doctors advised me to do all sorts of silly things. One 
doctor told me to stop fidgeting and another told me to sit on my hands.

Rebecca believes that posting the videos on the internet has aided her recovery

‘Some
 people say trichotillomania is a result of childhood trauma but for me,
 pulling my hair has been a comfort thing. I do it a lot when I am 
stressed or upset.

‘A lot 
of people at school and college didn’t understand why I was going bald. 
Lots of people mockingly called me "baldie". But it was the horrible 
looks that I got from other kids that was the worst thing.’

At one point
 she had so little hair she shaved her head to make herself feel better;
 at other times she wore wigs.

By
 the time she was 14 she decided to find out for herself what was 
happening to her. She did an internet search for ‘hair pulling’ and 
discovered what trichotillomania was.

Rebecca said: ‘All that came up in the search 
results were three not-so-brilliant videos on the disorder.

‘I
 decided to upload my own, no-holds-barred video.'

In some photos, she 
wrote the name of her disorder on her forehead in marker pen with an 
arrow pointing to her last remaining bristles as she attempted to 
explain the condition to the outside world.

Rebecca believes that
 posting the videos on the internet has aided her recovery.

'I have 
found it hard to speak to councillors but it has always felt easy to 
talk to a webcam,' she said.

A
 spokesman for Trichotillomania Support said: ‘It is important that 
sufferers know they are not alone and they should not be ashamed of 
asking for support.’
