A football player has spoken out about  his agonizing recovery seven months after a near fatal beating outside a bar.

Isaac Kolstad, a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, suffered a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury in a bar fight that happened last May near his school.

After months of therapy Kolstad learned to speak again and giving an interview on his 25th birthday this week, he told the Star Tribune in halted speech: 'My story is somewhat crazy because I have been through a lot.'

Isaac Kolstad, a football player who suffered a near fatal beating outside a bar is making a slow, but steady recovering in re-learning how to speak

Isaac Kolstad and his wife Molly. After months of therapy Kolstad began to speak again and giving an interview on his 25th birthday this week,  he said: 'My story is somewhat crazy because I have been through a lot'

'I can feel myself getting better through therapy. That is my favorite part.' 

His wife Molly said she has been encouraged by his progress since being told when he was in ICU that her husband had a three percent change of recovery.

Molly says then when the father-of-two started to speak this summer, he hoped he was going to keep playing football and it wasn't until later he realized his football players days were over.

The couple have two daughters - Malia was born while her father was in rehab

She wrote on Kolstad's CaringBridge page: 'Isaac is traveling three days a week to the cities up and back for his continued outpatient therapy at Courage Kenny. He will continue speech, occupation, and physical therapy sessions there at least until late spring. 

'We were hoping that he would be able to reach the limit of 8mph on the treadmill and we are happy to report that he did!!! Isaac maxed out the treadmill and is the first of their knowledge to do so. 

'But in doing that, we wore the poor thing out and they ended up needing a new one! 

'Hopefully the new one that is being installed hopefully this week will be able to handle the speed and power of Mr. Isaac Kolstad!'

In September, Kolstad, who graduated in 2013, made an emotional return to the playing field with some of his former teammates, walking out before kickoff during the opening game of their season.

He also became a father for the second time when his baby daughter Malia was born in June, less than a month after he was injured.

Kolstand and his wife have another daughter, Haidyn. 

Rutgers University quarterback Philip Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault for the incident.

Arrests: Trevor Shelley (left) and Philip Nelson (right) have been arrested in connection with the incident

Trevor Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts. 

Kolstad, described by a friend as 'a quiet, young man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in the South Street Saloon just before closing time on the night of the fight.

According to newly released witness statements taken by the Mankato police, Nelson was angry beacause his girlfrend had been kissed by a bouncer on the same night.

Kolstad congratulated Nelson on his football career and wished him luck when the pair bumped into each other outside a bar. 

But it seems that Nelson mistakenly thought Kolstad was the bouncer who kissed his girlfriend and the pair got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, according to a police officer, the complaint says.

Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that the attacker came 'out of nowhere'.

'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.'

He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance.

Kolstad suffered bleeding of the brain, skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint.
