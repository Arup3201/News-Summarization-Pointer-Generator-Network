Kim, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian have only a limited amount of time in the UK, and their fans are well aware of this.

With that in mind, Westfield London Shopping Centre was overrun with crazed Kardashian fans eager to meet and greet their idols on Saturday morning.

Police and security guards struggled to control crowds of teenagers surging through the gates to see the sisters who were attempting to launch their Kardashian Kollection.

Three queens: Kourtney, Kim and Khloe all looked immaculate as they took to the stage at Westfield London, where their fans had been waiting

Approach with caution: Westfield was completely full of Kardashian fans waiting for their idols

Simply boot-iful: Khloe stood out from the group with her towering height and knee-high footwear

Kim, 32, was wrapped warm for the promotional activity as she emerged from her hotel in the morning wearing a thick fur cape.

The reality TV star is used to being the centre of attention but even she would have been surprised at the response of her cross Atlantic followers.

Khloe, 28, had only arrived in the capital on Friday but got straight into the thick of things by joining her two sisters for the launch.

Thanking you: Khloe, who arrived in London on Friday showed her affection for the crowd by throwing up a heart symbol

At ease: Police and security guards struggled to keep the crowds of mostly teenagers calm

Hardcore: Thousands of teenagers slept overnight in the car park to make sure they were at the front of the queue

The X Factor USA host was concerned, however, about the huge amount of people that had turned up and especially the large number people who had camped over night.

Khloe said: 'We’ve already had such an amazing response to our signing at Westfield London today and are so excited to see everyone! 

'We can’t believe how many incredible fans are waiting outside (several thousand!) In order to keep everyone safe, Westfield had to action a contingency plan for those who stood in line overnight and allowed those people to stay in the car park.'

Get out of the way: Some girls screamed loudly as they sprinted through Westfield London to get a good position

Cease and desist: Police tried in vain to slow people down but the power of the Kardashians took over

Welcome to London: Extra security had been drafted in especially to take on the huge numbers of people

She continued: 'Anyone not already there is of course still welcome to come out today, but I wanted to send a personal message to make sure everyone stays safe!'

Khloe was right to be cautious as many fans were at risk of being crushed against the barriers. Police and security were seen pulling girls out of the crowd for their own safety.

Several women passed out and had to be given medical attention before Philip Green and a police officer spoke to the audience in a bid to calm things down.

Watch the throne: The three sisters sat up on the stage as their fans began to make their way up to see them

Super fan: Kourtney was overjoyed to meet one of her many admirers at the event

Full house: A fan is pulled from the crowd by security at Westfield London after getting squeezed too tight

Help wanted: One unlucky fan needed to be given water by staff after feeling very faint

Raise me up: It was pandemonium at the shopping centre as security worked extra hard to keep people safe

Once the girls took to the stage promptly at 12.30pm the shopping centre erupted with cheers and screams as the crowds went wild.

While Kim wore a predictably tight black dress with a gold belt, it was Khloe who looked the most fashionable.

We have arrived: Kourtney led the way in a polka dot jacket with Kim and Khloe trailing behind

Style queen: Kim wore a tight fit black dress with a gold belt and peep toe boots as she took to the stage

Moment of truth: The crowd went crazy when the Kardashians finally arrived on stage

The youngest Kardashian teamed a pair of over the knee leather boots with a long sleeve black and white dress.

Kourtney covered her post baby figure in a loose fit polka dot blazer which she wore with a black top and a pair of baggy black trousers.

There was no sign of Kanye West after the rapper had joined his girlfriend Kim on Friday night at popular London haunt Movida.

The king pin: Topshop boss Sir Philip Green took Kourtney by the hand and walked her into the shopping centre

Dressed to kill: Kim again wore one of her own dresses as she stepped out looking picture perfect

Next top model: Khloe was showing off her own fine taste in fashion as she stepped out with a pair of black leather boots

The celebrity couple arrived at the club in two Rolls Royce Ghost Phantoms and partied with other VIPs for over an hour.

Kim even bought a round of Midori shots for her newly acquainted friends and gave them some Ace of Spades champagne.

To top the night off, she showed that she is Kanye's biggest fan by dancing away to some of his many chart topping tracks.

Party night: Kim and boyfriend Kanye West hit the town in style as they enjoyed an evening at Movida, on Friday
