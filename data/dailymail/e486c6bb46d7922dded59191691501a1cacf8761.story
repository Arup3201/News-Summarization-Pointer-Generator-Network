David Cameron was last night forced to deny he was panicking over Europe as he unveiled the question that will be posed in a referendum on Britain’s future membership of the EU.

The Conservatives published draft legislation pledging a straightforward vote on the question: ‘Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?’

It said the referendum would take place by December 31, 2017 – by which point Mr Cameron says he will have attempted to negotiate a looser, trade-based relationship with Brussels if he remains in Downing Street.

The Prime Minister, on a visit to the US, said only the Conservatives wanted to give people a say and blamed the Liberal Democrats for blocking an immediate government bill. Instead, the draft legislation will be introduced as a Private Member’s Bill by a Tory backbencher.

Mr Cameron’s attempt to draw a line under days of Tory bickering over Europe won the support of arch Eurosceptics, including MPs Douglas Carswell and Zac Goldsmith and Euro MP Daniel Hannan.

But others rejected Mr Cameron’s olive branch, saying a Private Member’s Bill supported by the party leadership was ‘second best’ to a government Bill with time set aside in the Commons.

Former Cabinet minister John Redwood, meanwhile, demanded an immediate ‘mandate referendum’, giving the Prime Minister more authority to go to Brussels and demand the repatriation of key powers, before the in/out one.

Tory MPs are still expected to press 
ahead with a vote tonight expressing regret that last week’s Queen’s 
Speech, setting out the Government’s legislative programme for the year 
ahead, did not include an EU referendum Bill.

Mr
Cameron insisted he was ‘profoundly relaxed’ about how Conservative MPs
voted on the amendment, saying anything that underlined the commitment 
he made to a referendum earlier this year was welcome.

Asked in Boston whether he had panicked in the face of pressure from his MPs, he said: ‘Not at all. If this was a Conservative-only government, we would just get on and legislate. We can’t do that because we are in coalition. But I have always said that anything we can do to strengthen, add credibility to the pledge... we should do.’

Mr Cameron insisted he was leading the debate on Europe rather than being dragged along by his party. ‘The whole reason we are now having this debate is because of the act of leadership I gave,’ he said.

‘When the dust has settled people will
be able to see that there is one party, the Conservative Party, 
offering that in/out referendum and two other mainstream parties, the 
Liberal Democrats and Labour, who oppose an in/out referendum.

‘It is in the national interest to change Europe and change the relationship with Europe.’

He conceded that some Tories wanted to have a referendum immediately, but added: ‘That’s not my view.’

Senior Tory sources said an initial 
assessment of the numbers suggested it was ‘feasible’ that a backbench 
Bill on the issue could win a vote in the Commons, depending on the 
number of Labour rebels.

The six-clause Bill was drawn up by solicitor general Oliver Heald, with input from Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, one of the staunchest Eurosceptics in the Cabinet.

Pro-Europe Tory Kenneth Clarke said it would be a political and economic 'catastrophe' to leave the EU

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said that the publication of the draft Bill would force other parties to tell voters whether they will offer a referendum.

Tory MP Mr Carswell said: ‘I feel I can now say “Yes, thanks, Prime Minister. On matters Europe, that’s what I wanted”.’ MEP Mr Hannan said: ‘David Cameron has done what Eurosceptics wanted.’

Kenneth Clarke, one of the few pro-Europeans in the Cabinet, said: ‘I think we should move on now. The important thing is to make sure we get the right result from any referendum which is held to avoid the catastrophe for the country’s economy and our political standing in the world if we were to be so very, very reckless as to leave the European Union.’
