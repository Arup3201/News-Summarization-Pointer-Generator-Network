The leader of a body-snatching ring responsible for stealing the bones of veteran broadcaster Alistair Cooke is dying of bone cancer, his lawyer has been revealed.

Michael Mastromarino, who made millions 
of dollars by illicitly harvesting skin and bones from corpses, was 
given his last rites two weeks ago in a New York state prison.

Bone cancer has spread through the 49-year-old former dentist's entire body.

'I thought it was ironic, and I told him that,' said lawyer Mario Gallucci, adding that the twist of fate was not lost on the man who cheated the dead, but ultimately could not cheat death.

He is being held in Alden at the state's Wende Correctional Facility, a prison for infirm inmates, a state Correction Department spokeswoman said.

Mastromarino's ring dismembered more than 1,000 cadavers in unsanitary conditions in New York state, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and sold parts to doctors who transplanted them into patients.

Mastromarino had pleaded guilty to body stealing, reckless endangerment and enterprise corruption.

As part of the scheme, a team of so-called cutters removed bones, skin and tendons in an unsanitary embalming room, prosecutors said.

Cooke, the former newspaper foreign correspondent and the BBC's Letter from America, died in 2004 at the age of 95 in New York.Â

Vito Bruno, whose father, Michael, died of kidney cancer in 2003 and after which his organs were sold by Mastromarino told the New York Daily News of the irony.

The record producer from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who is suing Mastromarino said: 'You don't want to wish anything bad on anyone, but karma's a son of a b***h.

'He committed a horrendous crime against a lot of people. There are tens of thousands of people affected.'

Mastromarino, who was sentenced to 18 to 54 years in prison, is suffering from bone cancer, his lawyer says

The bodies were looted and the parts sold to medical companies to be used in dental implants, knee replacements and other procedures.

'Irony has its way,' Susan Cooke Kittridge, Cooke's daughter, told the New York Daily News. 'My father had lung cancer that metastasized to his bones.

'Of course you wonder about cosmic irony. But at this time, I feel so deeply for his family and his children. What a complicated time for them.'

Cooke Kittridge said that when she told her family Mastromarino was on his deathbed - and what he was dying of - 'everyone is kind of speechless'.

'What he did was horrible, but it's not for me to pass judgment on this man,' she said. 'Yes, he hurt me. He hurt thousands of people, but I don't feel any satisfaction that he is suffering, or that he is dying.

'It does make you wonder though.'

A relative told the New York Daily News that Mastromarino's ex-wife, Barbara, and their two children visited him last week. Mastromarino is down to 125 pounds and can't hold a cup.

Mastromarino has been serving an 18 to 54-year sentence for body stealing, forgery, grand larceny and enterprise corruption.

Lawyer Sanford Rubenstein, who represents more than 20 of Mastromarino's victims, has little sympathy for the dying man.

'It doesn't change the fact that what he did when he was alive horribly affected the lives of many families, victims and individuals who now fear illness for the rest of their lives,' said Rubenstein.
