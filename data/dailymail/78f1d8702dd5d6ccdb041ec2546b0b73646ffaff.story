A Tory MP has resigned from a key post over claims that he asked a Brazilian rent boy to supply him with drugs.

Rising star Mark Menzies, 42, left his role as a minister’s aide shortly after being asked about his relationship with 19-year-old Rogerio dos Santos Pinto – who told reporters that the MP had been paying him for sex.

The Brazilian said they met on a gay escort website and claimed the politician had given him a tour of the Houses of Parliament before allegedly offering to pay him £250 for a two-hour session.

And he insisted that Mr Menzies, who has been involved in debates about the Government’s drug policy, asked him to supply him with methedrone – nicknamed ‘poor man’s cocaine’.

Possession of the Class B drug became a criminal offence in 2010 and if a complaint is made to police then it could result in charges.

Mr Menzies resigned from his post as aide to International Development Minister Alan Duncan on Saturday night after Santos, who has now returned to Sao Paulo in Brazil, got in touch with the Press.

He claimed: ‘I have been having sex with a Conservative MP for money. Mark also asked me to buy methedrone. I have messages of him talking to me about drugs.

‘We met very regularly over the last 18 months. He took me to the Houses of Parliament. Recently, he has been asking me to buy drugs. I have SMS messages and photographic evidence.’

He added that he was in Britain illegally after overstaying a student visa, although it is understood that Mr Menzies was unaware of the rent boy’s immigration status.

Santos is also reported to have a photograph of Mr Menzies next to a plate of mystery white powder.

Discussing the picture Santos said: ‘There is a plate of methedrone.

'He asked me if I could buy methedrone. He had many drugs, a lot of drugs.’ He also claimed that he had received a text from Mr Menzies in which the MP asked ‘What underwear you have?’, and another in which he told the rent boy to meet him in south London and ‘Bring sexy underwear’.

Mr Menzies has yet to discuss the claims in detail but said in a statement on Saturday: ‘I have decided to resign as a Parliamentary Private Secretary after a series of allegations were made against me.

'A number of these allegations are not true and I look forward to setting the record straight in due course.’

Last night spokesmen for the Prime Minister and Conservative central office refused to comment.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that no formal allegations had been made against the MP.
