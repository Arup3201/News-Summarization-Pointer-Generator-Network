A former girlfriend of Australian businessman Geoffrey Edelsten has told of the lavish lifestyle she lived out as the 'arm candy' of the 71-year-old.

Shirley Moore, from Chicago, started a relationship with Mr Edelsten when she was a 21-year-old waitress after meeting him on a sugar daddy website.

She claims during their relationship, the Australian - who was then three times her age - gifted her with a $40,000 BMW, treated her to high-end restaurants, put her up at the Crown Melbourne hotel and gave her bundles of cash.

Shirley Moore, from Chicago, has spoken out about her time as the 'arm candy' of Geoffrey Edelsten

She was 21 years old when she first met Geoffrey Edelsten and started a relationship with him  

Ms Moore first met Mr Edelsten - then in 60s - when she flew to Melbourne after only seeing an old photo of him in his 40s.

When an older than expected man greeted her at the airport and she thought he was his driver.

But when the man gave her a hug and a kiss, she realised her mistake.

'I gave him my bags as if he was the driver...it was kind of awkward,' Ms Moore said.

Ms Moore told Channel Nine's A Current Affair she had a 'verbal agreement' with Mr Edelsten about the nature of their relationship, which she says was 'purely business' and that she did not love him.

She said the longer they were involved the more money she was afforded, starting at $8,000 a month or $96,000.

After six months, Ms Moore's allowance grew to $150,000 and then after a year it would be $250,000.

It was at the one-year mark that Ms Moore said that she and Mr Edelsten discussed marriage.

She said she would never had married him unless he gave her a lot of money, but even then her boyfriend would have to be allowed to live with them.

'I mean I would have to be fulfilled in some department,' Ms Moore said.

But the talk of wedding bells halted when Ms Moore claims she discovered email exchanges between the Australian and other women.

Ms Moore said she had not been faithful to Mr Edelsten during the relationship but she had not mislead him by saying she would be unlike the 71-year-old.

'I was mad at the fact that I didn't know because he kept saying about us being monogamous,' she told A Current Affair.

She said she had threatened to go public with their arrangement when she found the emails, but days later she had new wheels.

When asked if she thought Mr Edelsten had ever cheated on her, Ms Moore replied: 'Yeah of course. That's how I got my BMW.'

She said he also set her up in a penthouse apartment in Chicago to buy her silence.

But the relationship hit another stumbling block, Ms Moore's reluctance to go public with Mr Edelsten.

Instead of joining her lover on the red carpet for the Brownlows, Ms Moore did laps around Chicago in her new set of wheels.

And Mr Edelsten, she claims, was not happy.

Ms Moore said he sent her abusive emails that said: 'You effin messed up my life' and how much embarrassment her no-show had caused him.

It was after this incident that she was outed for another 'sugarbaby' - Brynne Gordon also known as Brynne Edelsten - who Ms Moore claims he met online and offered a $50 million proposal, including an engagement ring worth at least $250,000.

Ms Edelsten has previously denied meeting her ex-husband - who is now dating New York model Gabi Grecko - online.

Ms Moore contacted Ms Grecko soon after her relationship with the businessman began when he claimed they were just friends and exchanged words.

'I emailed her: "Who are you to Geoffrey?",' she said.

'The first email that she sent me was: "Go away you dumb b****. He's mine, we're getting engaged.'

Ms Moore said she emailed Ms Grecko because she and Mr Edelsten had been in contact with each other and they had planned to meet up.

And her parting message to Ms Grecko is: 'We're all disposable. We're all replaceable. What he can't live without is the fame, the photos, the glamour, the luxury.'

But her lesson to Mr Edelsten is ever clearer: 'Karma's a bitch. She just happens to be black this time.'
