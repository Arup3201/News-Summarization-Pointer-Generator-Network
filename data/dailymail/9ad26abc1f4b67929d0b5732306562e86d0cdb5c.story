It is easy to get stuck in the rat race - and even this rodent has managed it.

The animal was filmed trying to get off an escalator in Civic Center Bart Station on the San Francisco subway.

Jonathan Beilin filmed the helpless creature and uploaded the video to YouTube which has been viewed nearly 50,000 times.

The question most people want to know is - did the little guy ever manage to get off?

It is not the first time this particular station has made the news.

Last year it was reported that a high volume of human excrement was jamming up the gears which was stopping the escalators from working.

When the station closes, the bottom of BART station stairwells in downtown San Francisco are often a prime location for homeless people to camp for the night or find a private place to relieve themselves.
