SIX more Africans in London for the Olympics were said to have gone missing last night after the end of the 2012 Games.

Three from Guinea and three from the Ivory Coast have disappeared as their teammates returned home, prompting speculation they will remain here and try to claim political asylum.

It brings the total number of athletes and delegates attending the Games who have vanished from their team camps, failed to return home or claimed asylum to 21.

All are here legally because the visas allowing them to stay do not expire until November.

Yesterday officials in the Ivory Coast said the unnamed three – two swimmers and a wrestling coach – had failed to return to the Olympic village.

Reports also claimed three Guinean athletes had vanished. They were named as swimmer Dede Camara, judo competitor Facinet Keita and runner Aicha Toure, and were said to have been missing since Saturday, the day before the closing ceremony.

‘Three members of the delegation have not returned to the Olympic village,’ said Adama Doumbia, of the ministry of sports and leisure in Ivory Coast.

Officials are already looking for four members of the Congo Olympic team. In addition, five members of the Cameroon team, all boxers, have asked to be allowed to stay in Britain rather than return home.

They say have been threatened in their home country, and complain that promised Olympic bonuses have been halved.

Authorities in Cameroon, which is regarded as one of the more stable countries in Africa, have accused the boxers of wanting to be economic migrants and say they should have returned home with other athletes.

Two members of the Sudanese team and one Ethiopian are reported to have sought asylum in the UK.

Another Sudanese is missing, and two other members of the Cameroon team – a swimmer and a female footballer – have also disappeared while their compatriots returned home.

The London Olympic organising committee said it had notified British police about the missing Cameroonians but added that the athletes would not be infringing immigration laws until their visas expired in November.

Congolese judoka Cedric Mandembo disappeared after the closing ceremony and officials have been unable to contact him. He lost his match after 49 seconds and is said to have left the Olympic village without saying where he was going. His compatriot, judo coach Ibula Masengo, boxing trainer Blaise Bekwa, and national technical director of athletics Guy Nkita have also gone missing after walking out of the Olympic village with their luggage.

Immigration officials fear that up to 2 per cent of the Olympic visitors from some continents may claim refuge in the UK in the months after the Games, potentially hundreds of individuals.

Even those from some countries regarded as safe will have to be processed and removed, putting further pressure on the asylum system.

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games more than 20 members of one West African country sought asylum in Britain.

Before the 2008 Olympics seven members of the Cuban soccer team sought asylum after a qualifying game in the US, and the entire Eritrean national soccer team fled during a 2009 competition in Kenya.

Last night the Home Office declined to comment.
