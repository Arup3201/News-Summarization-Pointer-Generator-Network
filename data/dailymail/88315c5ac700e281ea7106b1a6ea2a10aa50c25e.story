The devastating secret is
 finally out: your partner has been having an affair. You had no idea it
 was going on and your emotions are in turmoil.

But what if you could have stopped it from happening? While we can't look into the future of our relationships, one author thinks he can help women spot a love rat before it's too late.

Psychologist and author Martyn Stewart has set about helping women worldwide with his new book, Why Men Really Cheat.

Is he having an affair? A new book by a psychologist sets about helping women identify the classic cheating types

Using brain analysis, anonymous case studies and maths, he has calculated the personality types most likely to cheat, and assesses and explains the reasoning behind their actions.

'Our society is built on ease. It aims to satiate selfish needs,' he writes.

Stewart, who has over 15 years of experience in the field of psychology - focusing especially on human relationships and cognitive psychology - cites men's top reasons for cheating as: fear of missing out, seeking recognition that they are a certain 'somebody', and seeking gratification via compulsive drives.

So, which five types of men should you avoid to save having your heart broken?

Tricks of the trade: Martyn uses brain analysis, anonymous case studies and maths to calculate the personality types most likely to cheat and assesses and explains their reasoning

First up is The Lad's Lad, the type of man who loves getting drunk and is easily influenced by his friends in the pub: he is the most likely to do the dirty on you.

There's also The Manipulator - who's calculating, secretive and rather sneaky: to watch out for.

Then there's The Stupid Mistake, the man who acts first and thinks later, as well as The Opportunist, whose carefree attitude means he will take the chance to cheat as and when it comes along.

Finally, there's The Disdainer - one of the worst kinds. He is a classic misogynist, lacking any form of empathy with his girlfriend but will happily sympathise with the other girl he's texting.

Stewart spoke to 547 men from all walks of life in their natural habitat - whether that was in a pub or the gym changing room - for the book.

There are 27 types in total, and each one has been calculated according to their brain type, thought process and environment (a complex formula called BET).

The book's synopsis reads: 'For the first time, discover the traits and characteristics of every type of man you have ever met. No matter what your opinion of men is, you will never look at them the same way again! 

'Addressing the number one relationship killer that has tormented women for centuries. It has even baffled some men about their own behaviour.'

Stewart's book, Â£8.99, has been such a hit he's now looking into why women really cheat (by popular demand, apparently).
