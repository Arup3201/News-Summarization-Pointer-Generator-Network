Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has asked his players not to play as many backpasses to goalkeeper David de Gea as he faces mounting criticism over his side's unadventurous performances this season.

Despite travelling to Newcastle United on Wednesday in a Champions League spot, United fans booed their team during Saturday's 2-0 win against Sunderland, most notably when an attacking corner was played all the way back to their Spanish 'keeper.

Though Van Gaal is keen for supporters to lay off his players, he does admit sharing their frustration at De Gea being over-used as a springboard for attacks.

Louis van Gaal said he agreed with the fans that sometimes it was frustrating watching Manchester United 

Van Gaal felt that sometimes his team passed the ball back to David de Gea unnecessarily 

'I agree with the fans that we don't have to use the goalkeeper so much,' he said. 'I have seen moments when we could play with a higher tempo without interfering with the goalkeeper.

'Sometimes the players may not see another solution. But I have to support them. Also, a fan has to see that.

'Of course, to attack is more or less the English style of playing a match. But I think the supporters have also enjoyed Manchester United playing in a possession game so it is always a mix of playing both. I think we can still improve in not losing the ball unnecessarily.'

United's run of two defeats in 21 matches has failed to paper over some other cracks.

Their supporters brought up in the successful Sir Alex Ferguson era chanted 'Attack, attack, attack' in the first half of their victory at Old Trafford at the weekend.

Probable line-up: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Evans, Rojo; Januzaj, Blind, Herrera, Di Maria; Rooney, Falcao. 

And record signing Angel di Maria was brought off after half-time with the £59.7million Argentine looking uncomfortable with Van Gaal's desire to win matches through controlling possession.

Van Gaal admits the raft of players he signed in the summer including Di Maria are struggling to come to terms with English football and said it may take 12 months for United fans to see the best of them.

'The first season is always difficult. You can see it with every player we bought – Shaw, Blind, Herrera, Falcao and also Di Maria.

'How long it takes depends on so many different aspects of the game, the match and also the culture of the country. You can not give a general answer – but the general answer is one year!

Van Gaal also felt that United's new players needed up to a year to settle in at the club 

United's season rests on the next six weeks when they face Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea in the league and Arsenal in an FA Cup semi-final.

Although it is a daunting schedule, Van Gaal is taking heart at their run at the end of last year when they rose from 13th to third after a run that included back-to-back away wins at Arsenal and Southampton followed by a thumping 3-0 win against Liverpool.'

Robin van Persie is ruled out of the game at St James' Park with an ankle injury while Michael Carrick is only likely to be on the bench having not played since January 23 because of a ruptured muscle.

Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera is available despite reports saying he was due in court in Spain on Thursday as part of an ongoing match-fixing investigation. The case, which involves 42 different football figures, has been put back until the summer.
