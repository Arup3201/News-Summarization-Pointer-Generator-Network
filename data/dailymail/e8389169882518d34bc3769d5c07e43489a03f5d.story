Manchester City remain confident of securing the £32million transfer of Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala.

The 23-year-old Frenchman visited Manchester last month to ratify the deal and the video footage of his trip was embarrassingly leaked on the club's website.

The hold-up is understood to be down to City and Porto ironing out the third party ownership involved with the player which is not allowed in this country.

Protracted: City have been chasing the defender all summer but appear to be close to landing their man

The video clip on the Manchester City website appeared to show Mangala undergoing a medical, and described him as 'City's newest signing'.

The club later said that their system had been hacked and that the video was not intended to be released.

Ferran Soriano last week said that Mangala would be City's last transfer business of the summer after they had finalised the loan deal of Frank Lampard from New York City.

City could yet sell another player with Javi Garcia and Matija Nastasic wanted by Napoli and Arsenal respectively.
