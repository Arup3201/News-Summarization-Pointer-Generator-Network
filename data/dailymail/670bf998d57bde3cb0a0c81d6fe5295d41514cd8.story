The Obama administration today dismissed a threat by North Korea and warned that U.S. is 'fully capable' of defending itself from a ballistic missile attack by the communist regime.

White House spokesman Jay Carney was responding to the North's vow to launch a nuclear strike against America.

North Korea state media warned of a 'thermonuclear war' as an unidentified spokesman for 
Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry said the North will exercise its right for 
'pre-emptive nuclear strikes on the headquarters of the aggressors.'

Show of strength: A mass rally of citizens and soldiers was held in the North 
Korean capital Pyongyang today after the regime threatened a 
'pre-emptive' nuclear strike against the U.S.

That threat came in retaliation for tough new U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang following its recent nuclear test.

Carney says the sanctions further isolate North Korea and show its leaders what will happen if they defy the international community.

He said the breadth and severity of the sanctions show the world takes seriously the threat of North Korea's nuclear program.

North Korea boasts of nuclear bombs but isn't thought to have the ability to produce a warhead that could be used on a missile capable of reaching the U.S.

In response to North Korea's third nuclear test on February 3, the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten financial restrictions on Pyongyang and crack down on its attempts to ship and receive banned cargo.

The U.S.-drafted resolution, which 
was approved unanimously by the 15-nation council, was the product of 
three weeks of negotiations between the U.S. and China after North 
Korea's nuclear test on February 12.

U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a former South Korean foreign minister, 
said the resolution 'sent an unequivocal message to [North Korea] that 
the international community will not tolerate its pursuit of nuclear 
weapons.'

In response to the threat of a nuclear strike two days ago, the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy, Glyn Davies, said America will take necessary steps to defend itself and its allies.

Referring to threats from Pyongyang made in 'recent hours and days', he
called on the North not to miscalculate and said the U.S. was working 
with South Korea to ensure it's ready for any threats that arise.

Democrat
panel chairman Robert Menendez said the North's 'absurd' threat of a 
nuclear strike on the U.S. would be tantamount to suicide.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice said: 'North Korea will achieve nothing by 
continued threats and provocations.

'These will only further isolate the 
country and its people and undermine international efforts to promote 
peace and stability in northeast Asia'.

The latest U.N. resolution specifies 
certain luxury items that North Korea's elite will not be allowed to 
import, such as yachts, racing cars, luxury automobiles and certain 
types of jewelry.

This is to close a loophole that previously allowed countries to decide for themselves what constitutes a luxury good.

Ambassador
Rice said: 'The strength, breadth and severity of these sanctions will 
raise the cost to North Korea of its illicit nuclear program and further
constrain its ability to finance and source materials and technology 
for its ballistic missile, conventional and nuclear weapons program.

'When
North Korea tries to move money to pay for its nuclear and ballistic 
missile programs, countries must now block those transfers even if the 
money is being carried in suitcases full of bulk cash.'

China's
Ambassador Li Baodong reiterated Beijing's calls for a resumption of 
the stalled six-party aid-for-disarmament talks between the two Koreas, 
United States, China, Russia and Japan.

'We
want to see full implementation of the resolution,' China's U.N. 
Ambassador Li Baodong told reporters. 'The top priority now is to defuse
the tension, bring down heat, focus on the diplomatic track.'

Council
diplomats say the point of the new measures is to bring the North Korea
sanctions regime more in line with the tough U.N. measures in place 
against Iran.

They say the 
U.N. sanctions regime against Iran over its nuclear program, which 
Western powers and their allies say is intended for making weapons but 
Tehran claims is peaceful, has been more effective than the restrictions 
on Pyongyang.

North Koreans rally in support of the threat by the Supreme Command vowing to cancel the 1953 cease-fire that ended the Korean War

Pyongyang was hit with U.N. sanctions for its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests, measures that were subsequently tightened and expanded after several rocket launches. In addition to the luxury goods ban, there is an arms embargo on North Korea, and it is forbidden from trading in nuclear and missile technology.

It imposes an obligation on the United Nations' 193 member states to block any financial services or monetary transfers that 'could contribute to the DPRK's nuclear or ballistic missile programs.'

It also adds a binding obligation on countries to 'not provide public financial support for trade with the DPRK' if it could in any way support North Korea's nuclear or missile work.

After Tuesday's announcement over the end of the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War, the North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun, said: 'With the armistice nullified, it would be no surprise if a global thermonuclear war breaks out.'

Although
North Korea boasts of nuclear bombs and pre-emptive strikes, it is not 
thought to have mastered the ability to produce a warhead small enough 
to put on a missile capable of reaching the U.S. It is believed to have 
enough nuclear fuel, however, for a handful of crude nuclear devices.
