It is now seven years since Ron Dennis was asked what he considered the biggest difference between managing the rivalry of Senna and Prost in the late 1980s and the then current enmity of Hamilton and Alonso. 

‘The internet,’ he said.

It struck me as an extraordinarily insignificant development for the boss of McLaren to be worrying about amid a multi-million-pound budget, a World Championship fight and Spygate.

Tension? Leiws Hamilton tweeted (below) that he and Nico Rosberg are 'still friends' and had ups and downs

But I now feel he was on to something relevant that has advanced at speed in the intervening years.

Social media, most pertinently Twitter, has taken off, for the most part widening rather than deepening the debate (or so I would contend as a hopeless reactionary). Everyone is an instant expert, even from his armchair. 

Whether social media is good or bad, how an organisation, for our purposes an F1 team, delivers its news, controls its message and engages with its fans has changed irrevocably.

We saw this when Lewis Hamilton tweeted that he had ‘no problem’ with his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, having publicly fallen out with him at Monaco last weekend over qualifying.

‘We’ve been friends a long time,’ said Hamilton. ‘As friends we have our ups and downs. Today we spoke and we’re cool. Still friends.’

As I wrote in a separate news piece about this on Friday, the timing of the announcement was odd.

I shall elaborate on my understanding of what happened in the hours leading to Hamilton’s tweet. I spoke to Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, Friday morning. He said: ‘I have to tell you that everything is fully under control. Everything is back in order.

‘I spoke to Lewis he said he would speak to Nico. From my point of view there are no negatives.’

Those quotes, and others from Lauda, were going to form the main item in this column.

To check a couple of points, I phoned a Mercedes spokesman. I specifically asked whether the two drivers had yet talked to each other. The spokesman said he did not know and thought it unlikely he could find out because Hamilton, he thought, was travelling across the Atlantic ahead of next weekend’s race in Canada.

Odd timing: Hamilton's Tweet came at an odd juncture - after Niki Lauda had announced the pair had spoken

Just over an hour later, Sky issued a tweet encouraging viewers to contribute to a debate, on the F1 Show, tackling the fractious relationship between Hamilton and Rosberg. 

Eleven minutes after Sky’s tweet, came Hamilton’s tweet.

So, were any of the events connected? Did Mercedes’ corporate types want to take control of the agenda, rather than let Lauda, who I suspect they think is too prone to go freelance with his views, set it?

Did they wish to steer Sky’s treatment of the subject towards a discussion of a rapprochement?

Mercedes deny it, of course. The same spokesman told me that Lewis tweeted independently of them, purely to reflect the updated situation. The spokesman’s revised estimate of Lewis’ itinerary was that he was ‘probably’ travelling to Canada this weekend.

Under control: Mercedes chairman Niki Lauda claimed everything was fine between the pair

I don’t know whether my suspicions that Mercedes had a hand in the tweet are right – and who can blame them if they did? It is someone’s job to have the acumen to do so.

A legitimate complaint from a journalist would be if the spokesman reacted to my call – in which I let him into the fact that Lauda had spoken to me – by feeding a tweet to every rival and so ruining the exclusivity of my story, such as it was. 

A final thought. Did Hamilton send his tweet – and choose the perfect picture of himself and Rosberg on unicycles as boys to illustrate a long and fun association – all on his own?

Did he not run it by anyone at the office of Simon Fuller, his manager? Or anyone at Mercedes?

I find it difficult to believe that he neglected to do so given the sensitivity of the last few days. That is the way communications work these days. We should at least be aware of this. We can then evaluate sensibly what is said, by whom, and how and when.

Denial: The German team deny there was anything untoward about the timing of Hamilton's tweet

It is interesting to conjecture what the reaction would have been had Hamilton prevented Rosberg’s flying lap rather than the other way around.

I suspect some fans would be split along tribal lines, just as they are now; that the stewards would have approached the incident as neutrally as they could; and that commentators, among them ex-drivers, would still try to be honest in their reading of it.

But if Hamilton were judged less sympathetically would that entirely be the fault of us observers? For he has been attracted to controversy like a baby to milk throughout his Formula One career; Rosberg has been squeaky-clean.

Not that there are not upsides to Hamilton’s headline-grabbing deeds, good and bad. Only last week he was named the world’s most marketable sportsman. His story in the round makes him what the American’s call ‘box office’.

Squeaky clean: Rosberg has a clean record in comparison to Hamilton, who has attracted controversy

In his spare days between defending himself against bribery charges in a Munich court, Bernie Ecclestone has been trying to sell shares belonging to the sport’s largest shareholders, CVC.

But I can reveal that talks with Canadian fashion tycoon Lawrence Stroll, whose interest in buying into F1 was first reported by Sky, have broken down.

With F1’s other investors nervous about Ecclestone’s future, the sport’s future remains in flux.

Derek Warwick, the driver steward in Monaco, explained to Sportsmail how the panel came to their decision not to penalise Rosberg.

I have read that offering this explanation in print and online compromised his independence. No, that is a non-sequitur.

I am more inclined to thank him for his transparency.

I liked Graeme Lowdon’s line after his driver Jules Bianchi’s ninth place for Marussia last weekend.

‘Trust us to score our first points in Monaco – we can’t afford to celebrate,’ he said, hinting humorously at his team’s belief that they do not receive an equitable share of the sport’s profits.

But am I alone in detecting an irony in what Lowdon – who is grandiloquently called Marussia’s president – said? Running Formula One cars in the plutocrats’ playground of Monaco is hardly the breadline.

Niki Lauda told me the Hamilton and Rosberg had spoken

But that was at odds with a Mercedes spokesman telling me that the British driver was likely on a plane to Canada

@highlight

The pair have been feuding all season

But has the team made sure, publicly at least, that everything is fine?
