High roller Floyd Mayweather very much lived up to his 'Team Money' reputation when he visited a Las Vegas casino.

The undefeated boxer posted the picture on his 'Shots' page as he appeared to enjoy his downtime away from the ring.

Mayweather has been keen to promote the Manny Pacquiao fight as the 'biggest in history' and the two fighters will go to war on May 2 in Las Vegas.

He told Fight Hype: 'Training camp has gone tremendously thus far, all I can do is just wait. This is not just a big fight, this is the biggest fight in boxing history.

'It is always being at your best, pushing yourself to the limit and just being sharp and smart.

'This fight will be a part of history. When you look back at Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns, Roberto Duran, Larry Holmes, Mike Tyson, Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Robinson, Wilfred Benitez, the Spinks brothers, Pernell Whitaker, James Toney, Cornelius Edwards and the list goes on and on. I just come in and take my hat off to the guys who paved the way for me to be where I am at today.'
