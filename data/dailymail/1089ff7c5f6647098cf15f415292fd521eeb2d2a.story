In tears: It appeared that Amy Senser had been crying before she went into the court room for her sentencing hearing in Minnesota on Monday

The wife of an ex-Minnesota Vikings football player told the family of the man who she killed in a hit and run accident that she was so remorseful that she tattooed the victim’s name on her wrist and said that she waits for the day she can meet him.

Amy Senser, the wife of former NFL player Joe Senser, tearfully apologized to the family of Anousone Phanthavong on Monday, moments before a judge rejected her request for probation and sentenced her to nearly 3-and-a-half years in prison.

Hennepin County Judge Daniel Mabley said Senser's remorse rang true, but he wasn't satisfied with her account of what happened last August 23, when she struck and killed Phanthavong, 38, on a freeway exit ramp.

Judge Mabley said Senser avoided taking responsibility, even after the panic immediately following the crash had subsided.

'This
avoidance of responsibility was not out of panic or confusion. It was 
orchestrated,' he told an overflowing courtroom in Minneapolis.

'A certain momentum develops around these denials.'

The
judge said the prison sentence was important to deter what he called an
'epidemic' of hit-and-run deaths in the state, though he gave her the 
minimum possible sentence of 41 months in jail.

Senser, 45, was convicted in May of leaving the scene of an accident and failure to promptly report an accident, both felonies.

Phanthavong's car had run out of gas and he was filling the tank on the side of the exit ramp near the Thai restaurant where he worked when he was struck and killed.

Parts of a Mercedes were found at the scene, and authorities appealed to the public for help in finding the driver.

Emotional: During the hearing, Amy Senser (seen here with her lawyer Eric Nelson) sobbed repeatedly and spoke directly to the victim's family saying that she took full responsibility for the accident

Forgiving: The victim's parents, Phoxay (right) and Keo Ptanthavong (left) said that they felt justice had been served and accepted Senser's tearful apology

Nearly 24 hours later, Mrs Senser’s defense attorney Eric Nelson called authorities to tell them they could pick up the vehicle involved at the Sensers'.

Victim: Anousone Phanthavong was killed in August of last year by Amy Senser in a hit-and-run accident

But the Sensers didn't talk to police, fueling speculation about who was driving and whether alcohol was involved. It was more than a week later that Amy Senser admitted she was driving.

During the emotional sentencing hearing, Phanthavong's mother and other relatives cried as his niece and brother relative read victim impact statements.

Senser sobbed, her shoulders shaking, and at one point she cried out, 'I'm sorry! I'm sorry!'

Khonevichith Phanthavong, the victim's brother, said they had started talking about opening a restaurant together after taking years to get close.

'Now we no longer have an opportunity to make our dreams come true,' he said. 'All because of one night.'

'There isn't a day when I don't think about it and miss him so much,' said Sayaphome Phouthavongsay, the victim’s niece.

Support: Amy's husband Joe Senser (left) was not present at Monday's sentencing hearing, though he is seen here at an earlier court appearance. He opted instead to stay at home with the couple's daughters

Deliberation: The jury found Amy Senser guilty of two of the three counts after she fatally hit Anousone Phanthavong on August 23 last year and left the scene of the accident

Senser cried later as she apologized to members of Phanthavong's family, some of whom wore T-shirts bearing his picture.

'I've
waited a long time to say I'm sorry. I hope you can believe me that I 
never saw your son that night and if I had I would have stopped to help 
him,' Senser said, turning in her seat to face Phanthavong's relatives 
in the courtroom.

'I take full responsibility for his death. It was my fault.'

She added: 'I just hope someday you can forgive me for taking Anousone from you.'

Mabley's sentence was on the low end of the range of 41 to 57 months called for in sentencing guidelines.

Prosecutors had asked for the maximum prison term, saying Senser had shown no remorse and made only excuses for the crash.

Moving forward: In a May court appearance, members of victim Anousone Phanthavong's family embraced Amy Senser after she was deemed guilty

Brittani Senser, left, testified that she was 
'furious' that her stepmother, Amy Senser, pictured right, had not come 
forward about driving the SUV that struck and killed a man as everyone then thought it was her

Senser's
criminal trial has been one of Minnesota's most closely watched in 
years, particularly due to the suggestion of a cover-up and the 
defendant's marriage to a well-known figure in the state.

Joe
Senser was a tight end for the Vikings in the early 1980s and has 
remained visible as a game commentator and as owner of a string of 
restaurants in his name.

Joe Senser did not attend the sentencing hearing. Their lawyer said he was with the couple's daughters.

At trial, her stepdaughter Brittani 
testified that Amy Senser only came forward only after Brittani — angry 
that some people had speculated she was the driver — threatened to go to
authorities.

Amy Senser testified that the night 
of the crash, she went to meet her daughters and their friends at a Katy
Perry concert at St Paul's Xcel Energy Center, and had part of a glass 
of wine at a nearby restaurant before going inside.

After about 90 minutes, suffering from a headache, she left, intending to have her husband pick up the girls.

Popular: The trial was closely followed in Minnesota because Joe Senser was a star tight end for the Vikings football team in the 1990s and now owns a chain of restaurants

Drive: On the night of August 23, 2011, Amy Senser was behind the wheel of the Mercedes-Benz SUV that struck and killed 38-year-old Anousone Phanthavong but drove off after she hit him

As she was driving home, she changed 
her mind and decided to return to St Paul. Shortly after turning onto a 
freeway exit ramp in a construction area in Minneapolis, Senser said she
felt a jolt at the front of her Mercedes-Benz SUV.

She said she was looking to the left at the time, and thought she had hit an orange construction barrel or a pothole.

She said she didn't realize a man had been hit until seeing news reports the next day.

But
prosecutors said Senser had to have known she hit someone, and 
highlighted numerous texts that were deleted from Senser's cellphone the
night of the crash and the next day.

The Sensers settled a civil lawsuit filed by the Phanthavong family shortly after the criminal trial ended.

Mr Nelson said Amy Senser got the tattoo of Phanthavong's name after the guilty verdict 'as a reminder to carry him with her.'

'She's not a monster,' Mr Nelson said. 'She would have never knowingly left someone to die. It's just not in her.'

After
the sentencing, attorney Jim Schwebel said the Phanthavong family 
accepted Senser's remorse and felt that the sentence was fair.

'What we got was justice today,' said Khonevichith Phanthavong. 'We forgive her.'
