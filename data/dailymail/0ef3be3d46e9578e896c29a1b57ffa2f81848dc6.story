One Boy Scout won't be earning his merit badge in Law. 

A Florida man  arrested for resisting an officer without violence made for an interesting mugshot in his costume.

Eric Fagan, 24, was found 'slumped over' in a convertible that was parked facing the wrong way on the street around 3:30am the Saturday morning after Halloween, reports the Orlando Sentinel. 

Be prepared: Eric Fagan, 24, was arrested in his Boy Scout costume after being found in his convertible 'slumped over'

When police asked him about his parking job, he denied he was even facing the wrong way.

He continued to be uncooperative, not providing his driver's license to police. He later took out the license to show officers but did not hand it over. 

'I explained that I could not read to from where I was standing and that I would not come any closer for officer safety reasons,' the arresting officer wrote in the police report.

After eventually handing over the license, he refused to exit the car and had to be 'removed' before officers arrested him.

Officers reported that Fagan smelled like alcohol and that his eyes appeared glassy and bloodshot. 

Police said that a DUI investigation was not conducted on Fagan during the stop due to his 'uncooperative nature.'

Fagan was taken in and photographed in his scout's uniform before being held in Orange County Jail.
