She's one of the most recognisable women in Britain, so if you are a bank cashier and she approached you probably wouldn't even need to ask for identification.

But apparently Katie Price's hair extensions, glamour model bust and trout pout aren't familiar to everyone.

When a female fraudster - without even a passing resemblance to the famous pin-up - walked into a branch of HSBC, she somehow managed to pass herself off as Jordan.

Now the fan who stalked the star, whose real name is Katie Price, is facing jail after admitting to stealing £2,500 from the celebrity using identity theft.

Kerry Marshall, 18, who has 36E surgically-enhanced breasts, withdrew £14,000 from the star's bank account

Kerry Marshall, 18, who is currently 
undergoing a sex change to become a woman, managed to con a series of 
bank tellers into believing she was the television star.

The teenager obtained details of Price's
 bank account seven months earlier after tricking her way the model's 
Sussex home by posing as a member of security staff.

Then Marshall, wearing a blonde wig, went on to withdraw £1,000 from the star's bank account in September and six days later took out a further £1,500 at an HSBC branch.

Marshall also bought a Mazda MX5 sports car using mother-of-three Price's bank details.

She also bought a Pandora Bracelet and purchased hundreds of pounds worth of goods on the internet using a Pay Pal account.

Marshall of Eastgate, Sleaford, pleaded guilty to five charges of fraud between 27 September and October 3.

Marshall, formerly known as Tyler Meadows, was charged under her new female name after being arrested in her home town during the early hours of the morning of October 7.

The investigation was launched after CCTV appeared to show a blonde woman wearing sunglasses withdrawing money at an HSBC branch in Lincolnshire.

Katie Price rang her bank HSBC and was told a woman claiming to be her had reported her credit cards lost or stolen 24 hours earlier

Price became aware of the alleged fraud when three of her credit cards were declined while she was shopping in Brighton.

Judge Sean Morris adjourned sentence until the New Year to allow for the preparation of a psychological report.

He remanded Marshall into custody and told her 'These are very serious offences. All options are open.'

The former Page 3 girl, 32, spent Christmas with her  large extended family and hosted a party at her Surrey mansion.

Having split from Argentine model Leandro Penna in September, Price is embracing life as a single woman.

She
 was pictured out on the town at the Mayfair Hotel in London starting 
her festivities early as she celebrated a child-free Christmas.

Her ex-husband Peter Andre is looking after their two children, Princess, four, and Junior, six, as well as Harvey,
 nine - Katie's son with ex-footballer Dwight Yorke - over both Christmas and New Year.

Earlier this month Price made an appearance at London's Olympia to promote her business interests.

The keen horse rider unveiled her new collection for KP equestrian range at The London International Horse Show.

Price first became interested in horses when she worked as a stable girl many years ago.

Now she combines her passion for fashion with her hobby and makes equestrian clothing.
