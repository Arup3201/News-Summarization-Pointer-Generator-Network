A pair of animal-loving police officers have returned a missing dog to her owner after a cheeky post on social media helped reunite them.

Constable Emily Atkinson, and First Class Constable Nick Morgan were on duty in Narrogin, about 200 kilometres south-east of Perth on Sunday when they got a call about the canine.

'We were on patrol and the stepdaughter of my colleague phoned us up and said there was a dog hanging around,' Constable Morgan told Daily Mail Australia.

Narrogin Police posted this adorable photo of Sophia on Sunday, who was allegedly in trouble for 'ruff conduct', in an attempt to find her owner

After picking up the dog from outside the local bakery and trying the ranger - who had the day off being Sunday - the pair thought they'd try their luck online.

'Both of us being dog lovers we thought we’d try and do the right thing and find the owner,' Constable Morgan said. 

They posted a photograph of Sophia Jenks, complete with a sign around her neck alleging the dog had been involved in 'ruff conduct' and was facing 25 to life. 

'Today on patrol a lost dog was handed to us. Sophia has now made bail and been collected by her owner,' Narrogin Police posted on Twitter.

Constable Morgan said they were 'lucky' it was a quiet day around town, and they had been encouraged to have a bit of fun with social media to help get messages across.

When asked where the dogs owner was, he said he believed Sophia's owner had been away overnight when the dog made the escape.

'I think he (the owner) was away for the night and came back to realise his dog had done a runner.' Constable Morgan said.

'It’s not the first time that we've had to return a dog, being a small town we like to go above and beyond and being dog lovers that’s the second time we've actually found a dog’s owner,' he added.

Luckily for all involved, Sophia was bailed and returned to her owner within a few hours, after a relative saw the post online.
