Seedy: The Rev Flowers poses in a photograph he posted on his Facebook page

Disgraced former Co-op Bank boss Rev Paul Flowers has resumed his depraved lifestyle of drugs and rent boys, despite facing fresh scrutiny by police and City regulators.

Although he promised to seek help, the Methodist minister is still using the horse tranquilliser drug ketamine and booking male prostitutes.

The new revelations come two months after The Mail on Sunday first exposed the former Co-op Bank chairman apparently buying cocaine and crystal meth. He was filmed counting out banknotes, allegedly to buy the drugs. 

Yet as he faces new probes into his 
behaviour, little has changed in the sex- and drug-fuelled world of the 
63-year-old Methodist minister.

Flowers
 is due to be reinterviewed by detectives this week, as two City 
regulators plan separate investigations into his professional conduct at
 the time the Co-op Bank was brought to its knees.

Yet
 despite the renewed scrutiny. Only last Wednesday he asked a rent boy 
to visit and promised in a taped telephone call: ‘I will have K 
[ketamine] but that’s all. You get what you want.’

Rev Flowers had told friends that he spent four weeks in rehab before returning to his home on Christmas Eve.

But
 it wasn’t long before he was back to his old ways. On New Year’s Day, 
he emailed an escort with the words: ‘Hi – happy new year!! You ok? Meet
 sometime? Paul xxx’

The escort was a £400-a-night rent boy 40 years his junior who Flowers had met only once before, during an all-night drug-fuelled orgy at his Church-owned house in Bradford last October. When the younger man jokingly called him ‘Gramps’, Flowers replied: ‘Gramps!!! I’ll f*** you so hard for that!!!!!’.

And as they try to arrange a time and place to meet, the former bank boss’s holiday diary proved packed: ‘Today [Thursday January 2] I am seeing Hairy Chris. Tomorrow I have to meet a friend at 11pm who’s coming back from London – to bring him over here for a couple of days.’

The ‘friend’ who Flowers took back to his house last weekend is a known ketamine user and the same man with whom he spoke of spending ‘12 hours in a ket hole’ in a text message on November 13.

Back to his old tricks: Flowers at the drug user's house

Slinking off: The Methodist minister drives off after visiting his 'friend' in Manchester late on January 3

The Mail on Sunday watched as the shamed minister arrived at the man’s house in the run-down Ancoats area of Manchester just before 11pm on Friday January 3 and drove him back to his Bradford home.

The following Monday, he headed to Manchester again, this time to go house-hunting. And on Tuesday, he aborted a plan to see the escort he had been emailing but rang him in the early hours of Wednesday to make new arrangements.

‘Maybe you could come over tomorrow night later in the evening,’ he asked. At one point in the conversation, Flowers shows a distinct lack of concern when he hears the 23-year-old had overdosed on date-rape drug GHB [‘G’]. The rent-boy tells him ‘ I had a bit to much G last night. [A friend] had to ring an ambulance. Getting that blood gas thing is the worst ever.’

Flowers asks: ‘How long were you in?’ and after being told about five and a half hours, shows no surprise or alarm and goes on to discuss how he got some ‘good press’ that day over a Commons Select Committee hearing.

When the escort told him he wanted to bring a friend along, Flowers grumpily replied: ‘How much have I got to pay for that, for God’s sake?’

Told it would be the ‘same as last time’, Flowers’ admitted he couldn’t remember what he paid before. He then attempted to negotiate down from £800, muttering: ‘That’s a lot of money’ before being told: ‘If that price is too high, we’ll sort something out.’

Later Flowers emailed over his concern that he didn’t want the other escort to be ‘off his trolley like last time’.

Flowers was told: ‘Yeah, that’s fine, he won’t have ket,’ but three hours later, as they made their final preparations for the night, Flowers said: ‘I will have K but that’s all. You get what you want.’

On Tuesday, Flowers is due to answer police bail in Leeds over alleged conspiracy to supply class A drugs. Then he may discover whether he will face criminal charges.

And last week the financial industry’s two main watchdogs announced they would be holding their own inquiries into goings on at the bank.

The Prudential Regulatory Authority, 
an arm of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority will 
both hold investigations into whether there was any failure or 
wrongdoing at Co-op Bank.

A
 City source said it was ‘unthinkable’ that Flowers would not be called 
to testify, although neither regulator would comment on their inquiries.

In
 November, Chancellor George Osborne announced a broad independent 
inquiry into the whole Co-op Bank affair. But that investigation will 
now have to wait until the two City watchdogs have completed their own 
probes, which are set to take several months.

Labour
 leader Ed Miliband was drawn into the affair as he had held a private 
meeting with Flowers in March 2013, a month before his bank lent Labour 
£1.2 million. Flowers and Miliband had two other informal dinners and 
three other meetings.

Shadow
 Chancellor Ed Balls’ office was also given a £50,000 donation from the 
Co-op Group, but Mr Balls insisted he had never had any direct contact 
with Flowers.

Last week, the
 Treasury Select Committee heard about the events leading up to the 
Co-op Banks’s collapse. At that session, Clive Adamson, the man who 
appointed Flowers as chairman in 2010, stood by his decision in the face
 of outrage and incredulity from MPs.

Mr Adamsons’s intransigence before the MPs delighted Flowers.

‘I’m
 fine,’ he said in a phone call to the escort the next day, which the 
MoS has heard. ‘Coping all right at the moment. I actually had some good
 press today so it was all right for a change. Some people were saying 
nice things about me in newspapers and on the BBC.’

However,
 committee chairman Andrew Tyrie branded Flowers a ‘financial 
illiterate’ following his embarrassing appearance before them last 
October when he put the Co-op’s assets at £3 billion when the correct 
answer was £47 billion.

Crystal meth shame: How the Mail On Sunday broke the original story in November

The news of Flowers’ on-going depravity is sure to disappoint those who have tried to help him conquer his apparent addiction to hard drugs. When our story broke last November he issued a contrite apology admitting: ‘I did things that were stupid and wrong. I am sorry for this and I am seeking professional help.’

The following week, as his Methodist Church employers offered their support while also suspending him from his parish duties, he was caught telling a drug dealer to, ‘bring the boy Charlie’ as he arranged a rendezvous.

A spokeswoman for the Church said she had no knowledge of the Church paying for Rev. Flowers to go into drugs rehab. She added: ‘He is still an office holder in the church and we will investigate thoroughly once any criminal processes have finished.’

The Co-op Bank almost collapsed last year due to a £1.5 billion shortfall in its capital reserves.

Flowers’ solicitor Andy Hollas did not respond to The Mail on Sunday’s request for comments on the new developments last night.
