Its glitzy charm meant it thrashed the X Factor in last year’s TV ratings.

And Strictly Come Dancing is just as big a hit with overseas viewers, the latest figures reveal.

The BBC show earned the corporation tens of millions of pounds in licensing fees last year as it topped the list of the most successful exports.

The format – known internationally as Dancing With The Stars – is now sold to 43 countries through the corporation’s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide.

The most recent nation to succumb to the dance competition’s penchant for sequins and salsa was Thailand, which finished screening its first series this week after buying the right to the format last autumn.

Dancing With The Stars now attracts a global audience of more than 250million people worldwide.

The US version is judged by Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli, who also sit on the British panel.

But while a peak of 14million viewers saw Louis Smith take the Strictly trophy in last year’s UK final, US ratings have peaked at 27.5million.

In India, where the show is known as Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, competitors put on exuberant Bollywood-themed routines.

The most recent BBC Worldwide figures show the top-selling formats for the part financial year since last April.

Hit cookery show The Great British Bake Off came second in the list for the second year running.

The BBC2 programme, hosted in the UK by Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, has now been commissioned in 11 countries, including the US, Australia and France.

It was originally licensed to Belgium, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark in 2011/12.

The show is tweaked for each country to take into account delicacies and local ingredients.

In Belgium, for example, the amateur cooks are challenged to make everything from pizzas to the nation’s ‘miserable cakes’ an almond sponge cake with buttercream filling.

In third place, makeover show What Not To Wear continues to earn money for the BBC despite being scrapped in the UK in 2007.

The programme, which offers sartorial advice to women, was originally presented by Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, and has been among the top-five international sellers for the past three years.

As well as licensing show formats for producers to remake overseas, BBC Worldwide also sells British shows ready-made.

Although the division will not say how much each programme has made ‘for commercial reasons’ the licencing of formats brought in £135.5million in 2011/12 while finished programmes made £292.7million.

In the last financial year, Sir David Attenborough’s hit natural history series Planet Earth easily topped the list of ready-made sales, with Natural World coming second.

Jeremy Clarkson’s motoring show Top Gear was third, proving popular in Canada, Japan, Bahrain and Belgium.

MI5 spy series Spooks came fourth, boosted by its popularity in Serbia and Iran, while Doctor Who sold well in Brazil, Israel, Spain and Turkey.

On Sunday (24), BBC Worldwide will host its annual showcase event in Liverpool, with 700 international buyers invited to bid for the latest BBC programmes.

The event is the world’s largest international television market hosted by a single distributor.

Elin Thomas from BBC Worldwide, said: ‘Dancing with the Stars is one of the world’s most successful formats. 

She added ‘Selling formats to international broadcasters is very different from licensing a readymade TV programme such as The Paradise or Africa. ‘When a foreign channel licenses a format, this means they produce their own version of the show with their own local cast and will usually film it in their own country. 

Sometimes the format will be adapted slightly, in consultation with us, so that it is really local in flavour and relevant to that audience.’
