The wife of Cameroon's vice prime minister has been kidnapped and at least three people were killed in an attack by the Islamic militant group Boko Haram.

The kidnapping took place early yesterday morning in the town of Kolofata, in the far north region of Cameroon, according to the communications minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary.

He said heavily armed fighters targeted the home of vice prime minister Amadou Ali as well as a local spiritual leader called Seini Boukar Lamine, who is also the town's mayor.

Boko Haram, the Nigerian Islamist 
militant group, has stepped up cross-border attacks into Cameroon in 
recent weeks because the country has deployed troops to the region, 
joining international efforts to combat the militants.

Some people were killed during the attack but it is not yet known exactly how many.

However, the minister confirmed Mr Ali's wife was among those kidnapped.

Cameroon's
 government has become increasingly involved in regional efforts to 
combat Boko Haram, despite warnings from the armed group to stay out of 
its fight with the Nigerian military or risk further attacks.

Yesterday's assault is the third Boko Haram attack into Cameroon since Friday.

Meanwhile, some 22 suspected Boko 
Haram militants, who have been held in Maroua since March, were on 
Friday sentenced to prison sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years.

Boko Haram have killed hundreds of people this year, mostly in northeastern Nigeria.

The Nigerian Association of Witches and Wizards have now also declared war against the terror group.

Spokesman for the group said it has held an emergency meeting to discuss a way forward.

'Witches and Wizards in Nigeria are deeply worried by what is going on in the country especially Boko Haram insurgency.

'As stakeholders in the Nigerian project, we can no longer afford to fold our hands while the nation burns. Enough is enough.' Dr Okhue Iboi said at the meeting.

He made is clear that the days of the terrorist group were numbered and told parents of the missing school girls will be rescued.

Earlier this month kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls who managed to escape from their Islamic extremist captors were reunited with the country's president.

President Goodluck Jonathan heard tales from some of the 57 who escaped after their abduction on April 15 before assuring them of his determination that those still in captivity ‘are brought out alive’.

Around 57 students managed to flee shortly after they were captured, but a committee investigating their disappearance said 219 of the girls are still missing.

According to a mediator working with Boko Haram two of the girls have died of snake bites while around 20 have fallen ill.

Boko Haram is demanding a swap for detained fighters in exchange for the girls.

Most of the schoolgirls are still believed to be held in the Sambisa Forest — a wildlife reserve that includes a mixture of thick jungle and open savannah.

The forest borders on sand dunes marking the edge of the Sahara Desert.

Sightings of the girls and their captors have been reported in neighboring Cameroon and Chad. 

Chibok and nearby villages are targets because they are enclaves of staunch Christians in predominantly Muslim north Nigeria.
