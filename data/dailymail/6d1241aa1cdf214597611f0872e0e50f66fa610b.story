The local news anchor who spoke out after a viewer criticised her for being overweight has now leapt to the defence of her attacker.

Jennifer Livingston sprang to national fame after she denounced Kenneth Krause for saying that her weight meant she was not a 'suitable example' for her younger viewers.

He apologised for the attack last week after Ms Livingston received a flood of supporting her brave stand against the bullying behaviour.

But she now seems to have accepted his apology - and even said, 'I hope people leave him alone.'

Weighty issue: Reporter Jennifer 
Livingston responded to a viewer email that chided her over her weight

The anchor for WKBT in Wisconsin told TMZ she had 'no hard feelings' towards Mr Krause despite his unprovoked attack on her.

'I hope people kinda leave him behind and leave him alone,' she continued.

Ms Livingston said she was pleased to have started a national debate about bullying, adding: 'I just think it's a discussion that needs to happen across the country.'

Mr Krause on Friday told ABC News of his regret at criticising the anchor's weight, saying: 'I'm in no position to bully her.'

He continued: 'She's a big media personality - I'm just a working stiff. If Jennifer's offended then I truly apologise to Jennifer, that's the last thing I wanted to do.'

No offence: Kenneth Krause apologised for the attack which provoked a nationwide response

In his initial email to Ms Livingston, first published by her husband and fellow anchor Mike Thompson, the security guard wrote: 'Surely you don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young people, girls in particular.'

An ABC reporter asked Mr Krause: 'She says she has a thyroid problem - did you consider any of that before writing the email?'

'Of course, I was obese as a child - I've been fighting with that all my life,' he said. 'Boy I can sure empathise with that.'

Speaking about Mr Krause and his letter on the Today show,
Ms Livingston said she was more insulted by being called a
bad role model to young girls than by being called fat.

'The person called me obese and I can deal with that and being called fat,
but it was calling me a bad role model that really rubbed me the wrong way,' she said.

'Not
only for our community but in particular for young girls, I am a mother
of three young girls and I felt that was an unfair judgement of someone
who didn't know me.

'I have a pretty thick skin, I'm a tough gal and can handle this type of thing, but what I was 
thinking instead was that I'm having conversations with my 10-year-old daughter right now about bullying.

'I'm trying to inspire her and teach her that if she sees bullying - the importance of taking a stand.

'But
what kind of message am I teaching her if my husband and I are talking 
about this mean email I've received and I'm not taking a stand for 
myself?'

The letter that Mr Krause wrote to Ms Livingston states that he was 'surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition hasn't improved for many years.

'Surely you 
don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young 
people, girls in particular.'

After the issue became national news, Mr Krause was asked to explain why he made his comments.

Though he refused to go on air, he released a statement saying: 'Given this country's present epidemic
of obesity and the many truly horrible diseases related thereto, and 
considering Jennifer Livingston's fortuitous position in the community, I
hope she'll finally take advantage of a rare and golden opportunity to 
influence the health and psychological well-being of Coulee region 
children by transforming herself for all of her viewers to see over the 
next year.

'And to that end I would be absolutely pleased to offer her any
advice or support she would be willing to accept.'

His harsh words drew much criticism and caused a major debate across the U.S.

Ms Livingston said on the Today show that though Mr Krause made a valid point about the dangers of obesity, she blasted his approach for being 'totally inappropriate'.

'I have never gone in public saying I am the shining example of what your health should be', she said. 'I've never said girls should aspire to have a body like mine, I've never told anyone to eat the way I do or exercise as much as I do.

'If someone wants to talk to me about the story I've covered then I am all about that. My job is to go out and report the news. But when you attack someone on a personal level it's not fair at all, I don't care if I'm in the public eye or not.'

Admission: The anchor said, 'The truth is, I am overweight. You can call me fat'

Hi Jennifer,

It's unusual that I see your morning show, but I did so for a very short
time today. I was surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition hasn't improved for many years.

Surely you 
don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young 
people, girls in particular.

Obesity is one of the worst choices a 
person can make and one of the most dangerous habits to maintain.

I 
leave you this note hoping that you'll reconsider your responsibility as
a local public personality to present and promote a healthy lifestyle.

In a special four-minute broadcast that aired before the news Ms Livingston spoke directly to her critic.

She said she tried to laugh off the comment as she was so used to criticism from being in the public eye, but was encouraged by hundreds of supporters to speak out.

She acknowledged: 'The truth is, I am overweight. You can call me fat - and yes, even obese on a doctor's chart.

'But to the person who wrote me that 
letter, do you think I don't know that? That your cruel words are 
pointing out something that I don't see?

'You don't know me. You are not a 
friend of mine. You are not a part of my family, and you have admitted 
you don't watch this show.

'You know nothing about me but what you see on
the outside, and I am much more than a number on a scale.'

And perhaps to address the writer's comment that she was not a good role model for young people, she used the opportunity to focus on bullying, pointing out that October is anti-bullying month.

Ms Livingston said: 'That man’s words mean 
nothing to me, but really angers me about this is is there are children 
who don’t know better - who get emails as critical as the one I 
received, or in many cases even worse, each and every day.

'The internet has become a weapon and is passed down from people like that man to those who don't know any better.

'If
you are at home and you are talking about the fat news lady, guess 
what? Your children are probably going to go to school and call someone 
fat.'

She then thanked the hundreds of messages of support and courage she received from those in the community and further, saying it was 'overwhelming' and 'inspiring'.

She finished the broadcast with a strong and powerful message: 'To all of the children out there who feel lost, who are struggling with your weight, with the color of your skin, your sexual preference, your disability, even the acne on your face, listen to me right now.

'Do not let your self-worth be defined by bullies. Learn from my experience - that the cruel words of one are nothing compared to the shouts of many.'
