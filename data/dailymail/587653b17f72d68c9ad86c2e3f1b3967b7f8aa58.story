Her creations became a hit with 
A-listers, including Victoria Beckham and Princess Diana, and in 1998 a 
pair made their way into the script of Sex And The City - turning Jimmy 
Choo into a household name overnight.

However, it was Mr Choo who went on to gain global recognition for the A-list favourite footwear label, not his business partner Tamara Mellon.

But after leaving the luxury label that she founded and managed between 1996 and 2011 - she sold her shares for £82.5 million - Ms Mellon has unveiled her very own collection of totes, ready-to-wear and, of course, shoes.

Debut shoe: Tamara Mellon, who left Jimmy Choo in 2011, has unveiled her £1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named Sweet Revenge

The legging boots are being sold on high-end fashion site, Net-a-porter

The star of her range is undoubtedly the 
£1,595 leather legging boots - appropriately named Sweet Revenge - which are a far cry from a dainty pair of Choos.

Mellon describes her leather creation as 'a thigh boot that pulls right up into a legging. You can wear a sweater over it or a big man's shirt and there's no gap.'

Net-a-porter, who are selling the shoe, write: 'Designed for a flawless, all-in-one silhouette, each size of this unique style is constructed with either a XS/S or M/L pant - wear yours with a fitted tunic for the slickest take.'

The capsule collection also includes a £725 leather tote, £550 stretch-wool piqué straight-leg pants and £830 fringed wrap-effect leather skirt.

Her debut range comes soon after Mellon told how her business 
partner did not design a single shoe for the multi-million 
dollar brand named after him.

During an interview this morning on the Today
 show, the 46-year-old revealed that she never received a sketch from 
him during the years they worked together; 'Not one', she clarified. 

Unaware
 of Mr Choo's lack of design nous when they joined forces, she said that
 she had to quickly hone her skills and use experience from her fashion 
writing days as accessories editor at Vogue to guide her.

Noting her increasing bitterness about the situation, she writes in her memoirs: 'By the end of 2000, Jimmy Choo was turning a profit of around £3 million a year.

'We had our own London boutique and were represented at 450 more stores, including Harrods and Selfridges.

'To top it off, we'd won a British Fashion Council Award, which Jimmy insisted on accepting on our behalf, even though his design contribution had been nil'

Not a design man: Ms Mellon said that Mr Choo, seen with a fashion student, was a skilled cobbler but lacked creative spark

Design process: Ms Mellon said that she would 
come up with ideas and Mr Choo's niece, Ms Choi would sketch them out 
and the two of them would go to vintage stores to look for inspiration

Ms Mellon said from 
there her relationship with Mr Choo deteriorated to the point that any  
conversation was 'out of the question'.

In my shoes: Ms Mellon offers a glimpse into her eventful life in her new memoir

Eventually, after much confrontation, Mr Choo sold his share in the company in 2001. 

Ms
 Mellon, who remained with the firm until 2011, said the years that 
followed were tough as she dealt with the death of her father in 2004 
and a divorce from her 'playboy' husband in 2005.

While
 it might have been more sensible for Ms Mellon to have gone into 
business alone, she admits that she met Mr Choo after going through a 
rough period in her life.

'One glass of wine for me turned into 6 o’clock in the morning and calling the coke dealer and then realizing, "Oh my God, I've got to be at work in three hours,'" she recalled.

After losing her job at Vogue at the age 27, Ms Mellon entered rehab. The experience marked a turning point for her. She emerged determined to pursue her dream of starting her own shoe business.

That’s when she reached out to Mr Choo, a cobbler from London’s East End whom she knew from her Vogue days.

Today, armed with a wealth of business experience, she has finally unveiled her own namesake label.

She concluded on the Today show: 'If I have a bit of equanimity now, and I'm better at standing my ground, it's only because I've fought my way through the rites of passage.

'I can't believe that it's actually happened...I had the dream and the vision. And now it's a reality.'

In her memoir, she attributes her success and determination to a childhood that revolved around a difficult relationship with her mother and unwavering support from her father.
