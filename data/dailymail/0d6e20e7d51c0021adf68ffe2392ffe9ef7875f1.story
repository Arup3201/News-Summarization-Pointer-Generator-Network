A Florida teen has had a lucky escape after accidentally swallowing two buckminsterfullerenes or 'Buckyballs' - rare-earth magnets that are incredibly strong and can perforate the stomach and even kill if swallowed.

Christin Rivas, 14, was given six of the magnets by a church friend just before Thanksgiving, and took them to her school in Melbourne to 'freak out' her friends with tricks such as pulling a pen up a wall from a neighboring classroom.

But the fun ended when Christin Rivas accidentally swallowed the magnets and had to have them surgically removed along with a portion of her colon and her appendix.

Life-saving surgery: Doctors removed rare-earth magnets from Christin Rivas' small intestine after she accidentally swallowed two Buckyballs

Buckyballs come in a set of 216 magnets that can be manipulated into sculptures and chain jewelry.

Christin Rivas says swallowing the tiny, spherical magnets was 'one of those stupid moments.'

'I was going to the bathroom and I put them in my mouth because I didn't want to put them on the floor. I wasn't quite thinking. The kid on the other side said something that made me laugh and swallow them,' she told ABC News.

'I started to try to make myself throw up because I read they were really dangerous and got really worried,' she said. 'I told my teacher, and she sent me to the clinic and they called my mom.'

Christin Rivas' mother, Barbara Rivas, did some research on the internet and realized that her daughter's condition was life-threatening.

She rushed her to the emergency room where doctors told her to go home and wait until her daughter passed the magnets.

Not content with this solution, Barbara Rivas sought a second opinion and christin was sent to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children.

'She came in overnight feeling fine, and in the morning when we repeated her X-ray we saw what looked like two round magnets and they had passed into the stomach,' Dr Tejas Mehta, her gastroenterologist, told ABC News.

Irresistible: The tiny magnets have proven tempting for children and kids swallowing them or putting them up their noses has resulted in a huge increase in magnet-related injuries

'We thought we could do an upper endoscopy and be done with it.'

Mehta was wrong.

By the third day, the magnets had become stuck at the end of Christin's small intestine, risking perforation and infection of the tissue.Â 

The buckyballs Rivas swallowed were made of neodymium, a material that begins to chip and erode in stomach acid.

The
 risk becomes even more extreme if more than one magnet is swallowed, 
because if they become separated they can twist parts of the intestine 
and stomach between them, cutting off blood supply.

After five days in hospital, Christin was finally released and her mother says she is 'doing well.'

Barbara
 and Christin Rivas are hoping to draw attention ot the dangers of the 
tiny magnets - particularly if swallowed by a small child who can't 
communicate the information to parents.

'They are very dangerous unless they are used for the right things,' Christin told ABC News.

'I wanted to make people more aware of this before Christmas when younger children can get ahold of the stuff. There is a 60 per cent morbidity. A little kid wouldn't survive.'

Rare-earth magnets pose 'unique health hazards to children,' according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Since 2003, one death and 19 injuries, often requiring gastrointestinal surgery, have been reported and between 2002 and 2011, magnet-related emergency room visits among people under 21 incerased five fold - a total of 22,500 cases.

Barbara Rivas would like to see the tiny magnets completely banned.

In 2012, the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) started a product recall proceeding against the former CEO of Maxfield & Oberton, the company that makes Buckyballs, linking them to 1,700 emergency room visits from 2009 to 2011.

According to Bloomburg Business Week, in February this year the CPSC invoked a little-used legal doctrine to attempt to force Craig Zucker, the former CEO of Maxfield and Oberton, to pay an estimated $57 million in costs related to the recall.

Last month, Zucker filed a lawsuit asking the U.S. District Court of Maryland to block the CPSC from seeking damages against him personally.
