An off-duty Florida sheriffâ€™s deputy shot a 49-year-old man he caught having sex with a woman in the pool of his West Boca apartment complex Saturday.

The cop confronted Tony Ribeiro and a woman he claims were engaged in a sex act just before 12.30am and told them to leave the pool area.

The angry man then returned to the scene in a threatening manner and was shot by the off duty officer who lives in the building, authorities said.

The deputy identified himself as a law enforcement official and asked the man and woman, who did not live in the housing complex, to leave the Reflections at Boca Del Mar complex's private pool, according to WPTV.

Crime scene: Gunfire erupted poolside at this Boca Raton, Florida, apartment complex where an off-duty sheriff's deputy shot a man whom he caught having sex with a woman in the water

The incident took place at Reflections of Boca Del Mar, where the Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy is a resident

The couple reluctantly complied, but a short time later the boyfriend returned and approached the deputy in a threatening manner as he was sitting in a lounge chair by the pool, according to a report by the Palm Beach County's Sheriff's Office cited by the station.

The two men got into a dispute, which escalated when the suspect allegedly tried to hit the officer with a wine glass or a champagne bottle, officials said.

That is when the off-duty cop pulled out his gun and fired, striking Ribeiro.

The amorous man was taken to Delray Medical Center in critical condition.

The unidentified deputy has been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation.

Shocked residents were interviewed by the taped off pool on Sunday.

Phylicia Dashoff, 23, told the Sun Sentinel: 'I assumed that someone maybe drowned in the lake or the pool, because I couldn't imagine why the pool would be taped off.'

It was really scary to see a ton of cops outside our neighborhood."There's always people at the pool,' she said.

Earlier reports mistakenly said the man was 65.
