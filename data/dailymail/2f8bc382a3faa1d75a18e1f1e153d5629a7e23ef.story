Lived to see her daughter survive: Pictured left after her daughter's miraculous recovery from a deadly brain-eating amoebic infection, Traci Hardi passed away Saturday after a nine year battle with breast cancer

Hardig had been fighting the disease for nine years, even braving it while her daughter was at death's door.

Kali Hardig was diagnosed with the form of parasitic meningitis in July of 2013 as her mother was in the middle of her own health battle, and although it is often fatal l she recovered after being treated at Arkansas Children's Hospital.

'There are no hard feelings,' Traci Hardig said at the time about the water park where her daughter contracted the rare illness. 'They (the water park owners) are just a family, just like us.'

Kali is the third person in the US to survive the parasite.

'I feel like I got a miracle': While her family will no doubt feel the loss for the rest of their days, Traci died having already experienced the miracle of a lifetime--even as she battled through cancer

The family of Traci Hardig released the following statement to KTHV in the wake of the brave mother's death:

The family of Traci Hardig would like to express our sincere gratitude for the overwhelming outpouring of sympathy and love for our family during the loss of our precious Traci.

As the public got to know Traci during Kali's fight for her life last summer, we all got to witness the tireless energy and boundless optimism with which Traci lived her life. She was a loving wife, mother, sister and a true friend to all. We appreciate all the prayers, words of encouragement and acts of love shown to us not only during Kali's illness, but now too during our time of grief.

We view this not as Traci losing her battle with cancer. Instead, we know that Traci has won this battle, as she is now completely healed, in no pain, and in the presence of our Heavenly Father.

The Family of Traci Hardig

Health officials say there were 128 reported infections like Kali's in the United States between 1962 and 2012. 

Before Kali, doctors could only point to one known survivor in the U.S. and another in Mexico. 

'I was real sick, momma wouldn't leave the hospital at all. Momma was scared to leave me, she told me', Kali said following her recovery.

While her family will no doubt feel the loss for the rest of their days, Traci died having already experienced the miracle of a lifetime.

'I had a lot of faith in this,' Traci Hardig said in October 2013 after her daughter's recovery. 'I feel like I got a miracle.' 

Before Kali, doctors could only point to one known survivor of her disease in the U.S. and another in Mexico. She must now brave the grief of losing a parent at just 13

Histopathology of amoebic meningoencephalitis due to Naegleria fowleri

Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific.

It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their noses.

The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees.

The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans.

Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years.

Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico

Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by keeping their heads above water; using nose clips or holding the nose shut when the head is submerged; avoid stirring up sediment in shallow areas.
