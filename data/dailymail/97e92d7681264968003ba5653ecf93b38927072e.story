A school project centered around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy has unearthed a previously unseen video - a re-enactment of one of America's most historic moments.

Seventh-grader Alyssa Leverton immersed herself in all things JFK for a school project about his death and the conspiracy theories that followed.

The report was so well done that it was featured at a state competition, a feather in the cap of Miss Leverton's principal Mike Merrell, who boasted about the comprehensive assignment to anyone who would listen.

Reconstruction: The video shows an agent posing as John F. Kennedy, with markings showing where the president had been shot

Catalyst: The discovery stemmed from a school project by seventh-grader Alyssa Leverton, who had immersed herself in all things Kennedy for the report

Scene of the crime: Bobby Lemons' camera was rolling as he captured a federal investigation of the JFK assassination in Dallas - months after it happened

One of a kind: The Lemons' footage is the only known color video of the reconstruction

Bobby and Jan Lemons were no different, but they had something to add to the conversation - the only full-color video of a subsequent investigation into Kennedy's death.

KTAB News reported that the video had been sitting in a kitchen cupboard in the Lemons' Big Country, Texas, home for decades.

They said that they were a young couple when they visited Dallas in 1964 - months after Kennedy's death.

As they arrived at the fateful roadway in Dealey Plaza, they found federal officials conducting a reconstruction of the murder.

Mr Lemons took out his camera and 
began filming as they witnessed an agent posing as Kennedy, with 
markings showing where the president had been shot.

It's the only known color video of the investigation.

They didn't know what they had: The video sat in Jan and Bobby Lemons' kitchen cupboard for nearly 50 years. They were a young couple when they caught the re-enactment in 1964

Until they showed the video to Mr Merrell, the couple believed that what they had was of little significance. They have since donated the video to the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas, which is located in the book depository from which Lee Harvey Oswald fired the fatal shots on Kennedy.

Earlier this week, the city of Dallas announced that it will mark the 50th anniversary of the 
Kennedy assassination next year with a ceremony 
featuring the tolling of church bells, a moment of silence and readings 
by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough from the 
president's speeches.

'I think what we want to do is focus on the life and legacy and 
leadership of President Kennedy,' Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said 
on Tuesday.

Mayor Rawlings added: 'The tone is going to be serious, simple, respectful, and it's 
going to be about his life.'

The commemoration on November 22, 2013, will take place in Dealey 
Plaza, where Kennedy's motorcade through downtown Dallas was passing as 
shots rang out.

The ceremony will begin at 12:25pm with the tolling 
of church bells across the city, followed by a moment of silence at 
12:30pm, the time of the shooting.

The Warren Commission that investigated the president's death 
concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald fired at Kennedy's motorcade from the 
sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and acted alone.

Rawlings convened a committee of more than two dozen Dallas civic 
leaders to decide how to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
assassination.

He said the committee decided the commemoration should be
 a tribute to Kennedy's life.

He added that students throughout the city
 will be learning about Kennedy and talking about ways they can fulfill 
his charge to think about what they can do for their country.

The ceremony, expected to last about 45 minutes, also will feature a 
performance by the U.S. Naval Academy Men's Glee Club in honor of 
Kennedy, who was a U.S. Navy veteran. Religious leaders will offer 
prayers and a benediction, and there will be a military flyover.

'This is an important day in a lot of people's lives â€“ this is true for people throughout the world,'; Rawlings said.

McCullough has written acclaimed biographies of Presidents Harry S. 
Truman and John Adams. He's won two Pulitzer Prizes as well as many 
other awards.

The memorial will be free and open to the public.
