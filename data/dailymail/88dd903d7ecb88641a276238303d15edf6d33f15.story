A Church of England charity has described England as one of the most unequal countries in the western world.

Church Urban Fund published research of the vast differences between the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in England.

All ten communities at the bottom of the list are in the north, with five of them in Liverpool. All but one are situated in the North West of England with the 10th in Middlesbrough in the North East.

Poorest in the country: Boarded up shops in Toxteth, Liverpool, the most deprived area in England according to research

Stark contrast: A cricket match at affluent Alderley Edge in Cheshire which made number two on the top ten richest communities list

The worst ranked community is Toxteth in Liverpool where 62 per cent of children and 52 per cent of pensioners live in poverty.

Ninth worst is South Shore, Blackpool where the life expectancy for men is 66 years – the overall in Britain is 78.4.

The figures are in stark contrast to the most affluent area, Camberley Heatherside in Surrey where only six per cent of children and three per cent of pensioners live in poverty.

Only two of top 10 least-deprived communities were in the north of England - in Wheldrake, York and Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

The Church Urban Fund’s research also show how in some cases the difference between a child growing up in a top ten or a bottom ten community can be a matter of miles.

Harpenden, Hertfordshire, ranks as the seventh most affluent in the country but is situated only six miles from bottom ten performer Farley Hill in Luton.

The findings were calculated at Church of England parishes by comparing life expectancy and poverty rates among children, pensioners and those of working age.

Paul Hackwood, chairman of the CUF trustees, said: ‘We live in one of the most unequal countries in the western world, where babies born within a few miles of one another can have widely differing life expectancies - of 10 years or more.

‘We urge people to go online and try out the tool and find out where their local community ranks in terms of poverty indicators.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg delivered his speech on social mobility, at the Royal Society, in central London today

‘We hope it will create a much greater awareness of poverty in England and bring people from affluent and less affluent areas together to think about what could be done to support those that are living in poverty.'

The figures and Mr Hackwood’s statement ties in neatly with an announcement by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

New figures on social mobility in Britain will be published annually to expose stark gaps in life chances.

The studies will chart progress in making society fairer by revealing children’s development.

The Deputy Prime minister said: ‘We must create a more dynamic society. One where what matters most is the person you become, not the person you were born.’

‘These are challenging times but that doesn’t mean we can give up on making society fairer and helping people get on in life.’

Mr Clegg, who appeared on ITV's Daybreak said that the figures published by the Cabinet Office today will be lifting a lid on an ‘absolute scandal’.

'In our country more than many other countries, where you are born and certainly what your background is seems to determine your subsequent life.

‘We are measuring that in lots of different ways.’
