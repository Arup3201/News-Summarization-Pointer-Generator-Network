A fully-functional plastic gun has been made from a 3-D printer and fired succesfully.

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said Sunday that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban these weapons, which would be  undetectable from metal detectors.

'We’re facing a situation where anyone -- a felon, a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage and the weapons they make will be undetectable. It’s stomach-churning,' he said.

Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a way of creating a 3D solid object from a digital model.

It is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of a chosen material.

The layers are then joined together to create the final shape.

It takes blueprints from computer aided design and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing.

The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace.

It can be used to create almost any shape.

'Guns are made out of plastic, so they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or sporting event,' Schumer said, according WCBS 880.

'Only metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to be detected by metal detectors, for instance, when you go through an airport.

'A terrorist, someone who’s mentally ill, a spousal abuser, a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage.'

Schumer wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new bill would add a ban on plastic high-capacity magazines.

'People have made silencers, stocks, triggers and lots of other gun parts. They can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone with one of these printers – and the printers cost about $1,000 – can make one,' Schumer said.

Easy to make: Schumer says a plastic, 3-D gun can be made for as little as $1,000 and can be accessed by any terrorist, convict or mentally ill person

The plastic handgun is made when the user inputs a digital blueprint of the weapon and it is then printed with molded plastic.

The technology is not new, it has been around for more than a decade, but only recently have people thought to use for weapons manufacturing, Schumer said.

While there is current law banning all-plastic weaponry, the weapons have just one metal piece, which is too small to be reliably detected by metal detectors and can easily be swapped out for a plastic piece.

Defense Distributed, the firm behind the gun, has put plans for it online so anyone can download them.

Founder Cody Wilson has worked for over a year on the project, and the gun is made from 15 parts, which the only non-plastic part a common nail, which acts as the firing pin.

Wilson says the design is based on the one-shot pistols that were designed to be air-dropped over France during World War II as inspiration - and also called the Liberator.
