Malaysia Airlines has slashed its prices for long-haul routes and is giving away flights as it struggles to hold onto customers and crew following two air tragedies that killed hundreds of people.

The beleaguered airline is offering a sale from London Heathrow Airport to Kuala Lumpur and nine other destinations in Malaysia, with return economy class flights selling for as little as £570 on select dates.

It is also offering cut-price deals to customers in Australia and New Zealand, and is reportedly giving away 12 return flights to Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, as part of a competition called ‘My Ultimate Bucket List’.

Struggling: Malaysia Airlines is giving away flights in a competition called 'My Ultimate Bucket List'

Malaysia Airlines is cutting its prices amid reports that its passenger numbers have dropped and nearly 200 cabin crew have resigned, causing crew shortages, in the wake of this year’s disasters.

Customers appear to be deserting the airline as photos posted on social media show nearly empty cabins. 

In July, 298 passengers and crew were killed when Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine – in an area controlled by pro-Russia separatists – while it was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam.

And 239 passengers and crew are missing and presumed dead after Flight MH370, travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, veered far off course and disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March. No wreckage has been found.

The Australian and Malaysian governments have agreed to share the £28m price tag for the new phase of the search for Flight MH370, which is thought to have crashed 1,100 miles off Australia's west coast.

Meanwhile, the state-owned airline is set for a shakeup, with analysts predicting that it will slash jobs, drop money-losing routes to Europe and China and replace top management in an announcement that is expected tomorrow.

It was already struggling when the twin disasters occurred, losing nearly £1bn since 2011. Malaysia Airlines regional senior vice president Lee Poh Kait told news.com.au that the sale aimed to help rebuild trust.

He said: ‘We would like to thank our passengers for their support during what has been a difficult period.

‘We are committed to regaining the confidence of our customers and sending them on memorable holiday experiences as a trusted five-star carrier.

‘With unbelievable savings these deals are a very competitive offering as we build a stronger Malaysia Airlines.’
