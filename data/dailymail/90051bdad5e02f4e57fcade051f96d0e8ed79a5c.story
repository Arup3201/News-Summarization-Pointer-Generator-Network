Killing spree: Maksim Gelman, smiled as he was sentenced for slashing Joseph Lozito in the face at the end of his murderous rampage

A man who was convicted of killing four people in New York last February, has been sentenced to an additional 25 years for slashing a passenger aboard a packed train.

Maksim Gelman, who is already serving 200 years in prison for the 28-hour crime spree, smiled as he was sentenced for slashing Joseph Lozito in the face at the end of his murderous rampage.

Mr Lozito, was on his way to work at Lincoln Center last February when he was attacked by Gelman and was one of his few surviving victims.

The 41-year-old father of two who helped stop the killer by tripping him up and subduing him until the police arrived started off an exchange of insults in court.

'When you attacked me, you went down real easy,' Mr Lozito said as he stood in court with

'You didn’t take me down, you jerk,' Gelman roared back.

'What you have, ladies and gentlemen, the funniest Russian since Yakov Smirnoff,'  Lozito shot back in response to Gelman’s outburst.

'F---ing moron! Jerk---!' Gelman yelled at Lozito.

Maksim Gelman, born in Ukraine, pleaded 
guilty in November in Brooklyn to murder and other charges in the spree 
in February 2011, which included stabbing his stepfather and two others 
to death, fatally running down a pedestrian, stealing a car and 
attacking a subway passenger.

Mr Lozito, who has scars on his head from the knife attack, named each of Gelman’s victims, telling 
the madman to 'just think about the lives that you changed.'

'They’ll never get to walk the face of the Earth because you’re a 
spoiled little boy,' Lozito said. 'Instead of taking your ball and going
home, you threw a tantrum.

'I hope you rot in your cell,' he continued. 'You have hell to look forward to, so enjoy it.'

When given a chance to speak to the court, by Justice Richard Carruthers, Gelman said:

'The only thing I have to say is, Kim Kardashian, will you marry me?' he said. 'I’ll make it last more than 72 days.'

Last month Gelman was sentenced to the 
maximum sentence for each of 13 counts; some of the sentences will run 
consecutively, resulting in the 200-year term, plus the 25 years he received this week

Last month Gelman was sentenced to the maximum sentence for each of 13 counts; some of the sentences will run consecutively, resulting in the 200-year term.

'You are a violent predator and sociopath,' Judge Vincent Del Giudice said at the sentencing.

Gelman's deadly spree on February 11 started with a family argument over whether he could use his mother's car.

He stabbed his stepfather to death in their Brooklyn home, then took off in the car and drove to the home of an acquaintance, Yelena Bulchenko. Bulchenko's friends have said he was obsessed with the 20-year-old woman and imagined a romantic relationship with her.

She wasn't home, but Gelman stabbed her 56-year-old mother to death, then waited nearly nine hours with the body for the daughter to return. When she walked in, he stabbed her 11 times, killing her, authorities said.

During his January trial Gelman interrupted Bulchenko's boyfriend, Gerard Honig, telling him he had fallen in love 'with a heroin addict,' to which Honig responded, 'You can burn in hell.'

Gelman was then removed from the courtroom for a short time.

After stabbing Bulchenko, Gelman left the home, rear-ended a car and wildly stabbed at the driver, authorities said. The driver survived.

Stealing the wounded man's car, Gelman drove off and ploughed into 62-year-old Stephen Tanenbaum, who died from his injuries.

After abandoning the car, he later hailed a livery cab and attacked its driver, then approached another car, attacked a man inside and seized the car, police said. Both men survived.

All those attacks happened in Brooklyn. As authorities hunted him, Gelman was next spotted hours later on a subway train in Manhattan, where passengers recognised him from newspaper photographs and notified police.

When asked by police why the four victims had to die, Gelman said, 'Because I said so,' according to the documents.
