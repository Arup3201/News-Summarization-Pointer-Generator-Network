A terror alert was sparked at Strangeways jail after prisoners built a DIY bomb from an empty orange juice bottle and caused a 'petrifying' explosion.

The Manchester prison was put into lockdown after inmates let off the device - made from everyday household products - and ran out of the cell in D-wing, which holds long-term prisoners.

The offenders allegedly boasted they made the bomb from a plastic bottle purchased in the canteen to show how easy it was, but reportedly had no idea how big the explosion would be.

Prisoners at Strangeways jail in Manchester sparked a terror alert after causing an explosion with a DIY bomb

A former inmate who witnessed it told The Sun: 'It's terrifying. One of the prisoners was boasting about how easy it was — and showed people how to do it. He was using everyday items you can get in a prison really easily.

'The boom shook the whole wing. The lads who did it were petrified — they didn't realise how big the explosion would be.'

They told the paper that the culprits, who included drug dealers and a rapist, lit the homemade bomb before running out of the cell.

Terrorism police were then called in.

Eight inmates at HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways, have reportedly been accused of endangering staff and other inmates.

However, a prison service spokesperson confirmed that the incident, which happened earlier year, was not part of an Islamist plot.

They said: 'On 15 July, an incident led to a very small amount of damage being caused to a cell. There were no injuries caused to staff or prisoners during this incident.

'We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously. The police were informed immediately and an internal investigation was carried out.'

HMP Manchester is home to some of Britain's most notorious criminals including one-eyed police murderer Dale Cregan, who is serving a life sentence.
