A 22-year-old woman has been sentenced to three years in prison after admitting to her involvement in an upscale Orlando prostitution ring.

Jennifer Helen Richmond, who reportedly told investigators she had earned so much cash - $500,000 - she had to find places to hide it, pleaded guilty to racketeering on Friday.

Her sentence followed a years-long investigation into escort agencies operating in Central Florida and throughout the East Coast, with serious charges only recently being filed.

The ring was allegedly run by Abdullah Hamid under company names such as Platinum Companions and Ashley's Playmates, according to The Orlando Sentinel.

Jailed: Jennifer Richmond, 22, who told police she averaged $20,00 to $40,000 a month as a high-class escort, has been sentenced to three years in prison

Guilty: Jennifer Richmond admitted to working as an escort and plead guilty to racketeering

However Hamid has not been charged as part of the investigation.

Investigators said 15 to 20 women worked for Hamid during the past five to eight years, said Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation Director Larry Zwieg.

Advertisements appeared on dozens of adult websites and even Facebook, offering 'high class private incall and outcall service'.

One hour with an escort ranged from $300 to $400.

A dinner date for up to five hours ranged from $1,500 to $1,800.

WFTV reports they would often work out of the Westgate Palace in Orlando, a major family-oriented resorts just down the road from Wet N' Wild.

The MBI alleged that Richmond, Hamid and an accomplice, Christina Lynn Davis, had so much money they would hide it in the air vents of their apartment at the Lofts at SoDo in downtown Orlando

They stashed more of it in storage units, it was alleged.

Davis, who told agents she made up to $80,000 a month as an escort herself, has not been charged.

The 22-year-old said the group would stash cash in the air vents and under carpet at their apartment at the Lofts at SoDo in downtown Orlando

Cashed up: Richmond allegedly told police she would not tell them where she had hid the money she earned

Hiring: This document, which is dated June 4, 2012, is an advertisement for one of the escort agencies looking for women to employ

Her and Hamid have since moved away from the Orlando area.

Richmond admitted to police she made $20,000 to $40,000 a month and admitted she hid about $500,000.

However most of the money has not been seized.

According to the MBI report, an agent who questioned Richmond after she was arrested asked where the money was hidden.

'I won't tell you,' Richmond said.

'I don't have to answer that.'
