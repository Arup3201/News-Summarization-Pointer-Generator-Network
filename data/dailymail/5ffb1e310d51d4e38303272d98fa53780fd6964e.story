Labour’s favourite think-tank has declared a new war on the motorist with draconian Big Brother pay-as-you-drive tax plans to force middle class drivers to pay more per mile to drive their cars than poorer ones.

Spy-in-the-cab black box technology would be used to track each car’s mileage by GPS satellite and to calculate the tax charge every time the driver fills up at the garage to encourage ‘behaviour change.’

It says the Government’s Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency (DVLA) should be linked to HM Revenue and Customs records so that drivers could be charged automatically according to their income level – with wealthier motorists paying more.

Under the IPPR plan, information on the tax affairs of drivers could be used to charge the better off more to use the roads

Drivers should also be charged a higher rate of tax for making ‘unecessary’ short journeys that they could have made on foot or by bicycle, says the report by the left-of centre Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).

The pay-as-you-drive tax rate should even be increased in summer when more daylight and warmer weather meant there was more incentive for people to leave the car behind and walk or cycle, it adds.

Gas-guzzling cars that create more air pollution - such as most of those powered by diesel - should be charged at a higher rate.

To avoid opposition, schemes should be brought local by stealth and without referenda votes which might scupper them, it said.

But motoring groups condemned the Big Brother plans as ‘beyond Orwellian’.

Under the plans each driver’s journeys would be monitored ‘using GPS tracking technology linked either to an in-vehicle unit or to a smartphone’. 

The travel data would then be transmitted from the vehicle to the petrol station each time the driver filled up. Payments could be collected through mobile phone bills or by the driver’s insurer. 

The IPPR argues that the existing systems of taxing motoring – fuel duty and road tax (VED)- are unfair and ‘blunt tools’. 

This is because many poor people are priced off the roads by high rates of fuel duty and the higher rates of vehicle excise duty on older, less efficient cars, which they are more likely to drive, it argues. 

It also notes that as cars become increasingly fuel efficient, tax revenue to the Treasury is set to fall.

The IPPR is close to leading Labour politicians and inspired some of Ed Miliband’s policies to give tenants more rights in the private rented sector. 

"A poor person driving a certain car a certain distance, in a particular area and at a particular time, should be charged less than a rich person making the same journey"

The report was written by IPPR Fellow Mark Rowney, a Labour candidate standing in Battersea, south London, in coming local elections. 

n his preface and acknowledgements, Mr Rowney author thanks Labour political rising star Will Straw, son of former Labour Cabinet minister Jack Straw, noting: ’Special gratitude is reserved for Will Straw for his support, guidance and comments throughout the research and writing process.’

The 62-page IPPR report is called ‘The Long Road to Ruin – why the UK needs to reform motoring taxes.’

It says: ‘The unfairness, unsustainability and unhealthiness of current motoring taxation mean that reform is urgently needed to transform it into a progressive system that is based upon road useage.’

It notes how the technology exists to allow ‘wireless transmission of mileage data to fuel stations’ and ‘GPS tracking using ‘satnavs’ or mobile phones’ and the black boxes used ion ‘pay-as-you-go-insurance.’

It says: ’These can be utilised to create taxation structures that encourage behaviour change.’

The report says the technology would allow ‘seasonal pricing to encourage active travel in summer; charging comparatively more for shorter journeys; charging polluting vehicles more than less polluting vehicles.’

Significantly it raises the spectre of ‘linking tax levels to personal information held by HM Revenue and Customes to make motor tax progressive.’

It adds: ’It is theoretically possible to create a system that targets individual unnecessary journeys and make allowances for peoples incomes.’

Spelling out the detail it says: ‘A poor person driving a certain car a certain distance, in a particular area and at a particular time, should be charged less than a rich person making the same journey.

It adds: ‘A replacement motoring tax in the UK could be progressive by linking information on vehicle ownership held by the DVLA to information on income held by HMRC. It would thereby be possible to create a system that targets individual unnecessary journeys but which makes allowances for people’s incomes.’

The report raises the spectre of ‘linking tax levels to personal information held by HM Revenue and Customs to make motor tax progressive.’

The report says the shift to electric cars and greater fuel efficiency will result in a fall in tax revenues under the present system, forcing the Treasury to consider reforms to keep up the £38billion tax collected annually.

The IPPR accepts that changes to motoring taxes are ‘politically toxic’ – especially since the last Labour government’s failed attempt to introduce nationwide pay-as-you-drive congestion charging.

But it is convinced the public could be won over gradually.

The IPPR concludes: ‘It will require a great deal of political courage. Those who might oppose reform can validly be accused of wilful fiscal irresponsibility, ignoring the plight of the squeezed middle and the poor.’

The report says the car-charging schemes should be introduced locally but – mindful of voters in Manchester and Edinburgh throwing out such ideas in the past - without a local vote: ’Referendums should be avoided if possible.’

When the Coalition took power in 2010, then Transport Secretary Phillip Hammond pledged to ‘end the war on the motorist’ after more than a decade of labour’s anti-motorist policies, including pay-as-yu drive road charging.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘This proposal is beyond Orwellian — monitoring people’s movements, telling them when they can and can’t drive. Who would want to live in a society like that?’

He questioned the IPPR conclusion that motoring taxes penalised the poor noting: ‘We have 30 million cars on the road. It’s not like the 1950s or 1960s when arguably motoring really was for the rich.’
