A bizarre new technology allows swimmers to listen to music while underwater, by conducting sound through the bones in the human skull.

The Neptune headphones send sound waves to the inner ears through swimmer's cheekbones, resulting in them being able to hear music in their heads.

The device mimics the way dolphins and whales communicate in the water by transmitting sound vibrations.

The device has been popular among recreational swimmers who can listen to up to 1,000 songs on the mp3 player which rests on their goggles

A waterproof mp3 player streams the 
music which resonates through the bones and into the highly sensitive 
cochlea part of the ear.

The headphones take inspiration from a 1970s product which transmitted music through the collarbone in the same way. 

Dave Seiler, from US 
manufacturers Finis, said: 'Back in the 70s there was a product called 
the Bone Fone, a floppy tube that was worn round the neck and 
transferred sound into users' collarbones.

'The product wasn't very successful and so the technology lay dormant until recently when we revived it.

'We have come along way since those times and have now launched a truly unique product in the Neptune.

'Bone conduction is perfect for using under water because there is no air for sound to travel though.

'The speakers of the Neptune sit on the cheek just in front of the ear.

'These speakers then send vibrations through the cheek bones to the inner ear.

'The result is an incredible audio experience that makes you feel like the music is playing inside your head.'It is the same way that whales and dolphins listen to one another.

'Having the music just appear in your head is quite surreal but once swimmers get used to it they love it.

'Neptune
has been a real hit with recreational swimmers, and it can store 1,000 
songs so the user will run out of energy long before they run out of 
music.'

The Neptune, which holds holds 1,000 songs, costs  £100 and can be bought at finisinc.com.
