Betting companies have been accused of encouraging young people and women to gamble by taking bets on the outcome of reality television shows.

Major bookmakers such as Coral, Ladbrokes, William Hill and Paddy Power allow punters to place bets on shows such as The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing.

And, with the rise of online betting, people no longer need to travel to dedicated shops to place bets, being able to gamble on their phone or computer from the comfort of their own home.

Politicians and academics said yesterday that companies should act more responsibly to ensure that young people don’t become addicted to gambling.

They also called for adverts promoting gambling to be taken off air before the watershed or even for betting to be banned on shows broadcast before the 9pm cut-off point.

Liberal Democrat MP Tessa Munt said bookmakers should not be encouraging young people to gamble by accepting bets on these shows.

She said: ‘I’m a liberal, so I tend to think people should take responsibility for themselves but the problem is that the audience for these [reality television] shows – and you only have to look at the crowd that attends these events – is young people.

‘It’s not safe to guide people up this path and teach them it’s okay to bet on everything. Gambling is something that adults should be allowed to choose to do but it is not something that should be touted and advertised at younger people.

‘It is a new market because I’m sure there will be very little overlap between those who watch reality television and those who sit in front of the horse racing. 

'We need to ask the companies to act more responsibly and to take the right steps to protect people.

Critics accused the businesses of trying to lure in younger customers by offering odds on the shows 

‘People need to know that you don’t get something for nothing and the betting shop always wins’.

Viewers can get odds of 13/8 for Jake Wood to win on Strictly and of 6/4 for Andrea Faustini to win X Factor, they can even place bets on whether any of the judges on the ITV talent show will swap seats on this weekend’s programmes.

The audience for these shows is predominantly young and female.

For Strictly Come Dancing, 63 percent of the audience is female and 52 percent under 16.

Similarly with The X Factor, the figures are 62 percent and 53 percent.

According to official figures collected by the Gambling Commission, more young people are starting to gamble.

The number of 18-24 year olds admitting to having placed a bet in the last four weeks has risen from 38.8 percent in 2010 to 50 percent so far this year.

Dr Carolyn Downs, a lecturer and Lancaster University Management School an expert on the gambling sector, said these groups are being specifically targeted by bookmakers.

She said: ‘There has definitely been a move towards targeting women and young people. [Betting companies] need to get more people to gamble because otherwise, how can they grow the market?’

And she added that not enough is being done to stop people from gambling under the age of 18.

‘We do actually know that young people are more vulnerable to gambling. Young people are not allowed to go and bet in a betting shop but it’s much more difficult to regulate that in an online environment. 

'They can use a parent’s credit or debit card, we know that happens, and it’s difficult to police, especially as they have access to the internet 24/7’.

Professor Mark Griffiths, of Nottingham Trent University, agreed that it is a conscious shift in direction being taken by the gambling industry.

He said: ‘Traditionally betting, particularly in bookmakers, has been a male domain. 

'Now, that’s not say that females aren’t interested in sport but in all honesty they don’t tend to bet on it but they are interested on who’s going to leave the Big Brother house, who’s going to win X Factor, those kind of things.

'I personally think it’s bookmakers wanting to increase their clientele and getting more people betting.

‘Then of course, we’ve also got a young youth culture coming through and I would not be surprised if you have young men as well at 18 and 19 betting on X Factor or Big Brother like they would on sporting events.’

Critics fear the availability of online gambling is dangerous for young consumers 

There have also been calls for betting companies to show greater responsibility in who they encourage to gamble, with some suggesting that having adverts for betting companies airing before the watershed send the wrong message to young people.

Professor Griffiths said: ‘I don’t have an anti-gambling bone in my body but I personally don’t want to see gambling adverts before the watershed at nine o’clock, that might sound a bit draconian but my kids are lucky that they have a father who can explain the ins and outs of gambling and why, in the long run, people don’t win.’

Miss Munt went even further, calling for bookmakers to stop accepting bets on television programmes aired before the watershed.

She said: ‘The watershed is the watershed and this shouldn’t be happening before that time. This is an adult activity and you have to take responsibility for losing your own money. 

'If these programmes are on before the watershed then they shouldn’t be involved in any sort of gaming.’ 

A spokesman for the Association of British Bookmakers said: ‘In independent age verification testing, the latest figures show an 87 per cent success rate on challenging young people for ID who attempted to place a bet.

‘Since 2009, all the major operators have funded independent age verification testing in all of their shops. A high compliance rate was found from the very start, with the industry now regularly scoring far higher than other age restricted retail sectors.

‘Last month, for example, William Hill received the highest score for any age related retailer for successfully keeping underage teens from their shops.

‘And all operators enforce a rigid ‘Think 21’ policy as part of the ABB Code for Responsible Gambling.’
