Jailed: Man City youth team player Courtney Meppen Walter wept in court as he was jailed for 16 months for killing a brother and sister while speeding in his Mercedes

A Manchester City footballer who killed a brother and sister 
whilst 'showboating' in a Mercedes cried in court today after he was jailed for 16 months.

Courtney Meppen-Walter, 18, was at the wheel of the 'high powered' Mercedes C220 saloon and doing nearly double the 30mph speed limit when he hit a Nissan Micra emerging from a side street.

The Nissan driver, Kulwant Singh, 32, from Salford, and his sister, front-seat passenger Ravel Kaur, 37, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, were both killed.

Moments earlier, the defendant had been 'jockeying' and 'playing games' with a friend in a VW Golf along a nearby dual carriageway.

Following the crash, Meppen-Walter got out of his car and tried to help the injured, waving his arms and saying: 'What have I done?'

The defendant, who is also the captain of the England Under-18 side and played 17 times for his country, will serve half his sentence - eight months - in custody but may be released earlier on an electronic tag.

He was also ordered to sell his 
luxury car so the money could go to Mrs Kaur's two 
orphaned children.

Mr Singh's widow sat in the public gallery, with an interpreter relaying the proceedings, and wiped away tears during the hearing.

The crash victims came to the UK in 2001 to start a new life after fleeing persecution by the Taliban, the court heard.

Ms Kaur's two sons, aged 16 and 17, both back-seat passengers, were injured in the crash, which happened in central Manchester at about 10.15pm on September 1 last year. They are now orphans after their father was killed in Afghanistan.

Meppen-Walter had one previous conviction for speeding - again doing 56mph in a 30mph zone.

Dressed in a dark suit and overcoat, Meppen-Walter was in tears as he went into the dock, before the judge entered the room, and wept throughout the proceedings and as he was jailed.

Meppen-Walter, of Blackley, Manchester, admitted two counts of causing death by careless driving at the city’s magistrates’ court earlier this month.

Mark Kellet, prosecuting, told the court earlier on that Saturday night the defendant met a group of friends, Aaron Whitehorne, James Conroy and Shay Facey at a restaurant in Rusholme, then went to a Sheesha Bar before they agreed to go home, get changed and go to a nightclub later.

Meppen-Walter got into his car and Mr Conroy drove off in his Golf with Mr Whitehorne as passenger.

As the cars got to Trinity Way in central Manchester another driver Saleem Mirza, saw them 'jockeying', the court heard, with the cars accelerating hard then slowing down.

'They were constantly accelerating and slowing, with the rear of the Mercedes dipping down and smoke coming from the exhaust as diesels do,' Mr Mirza told police.

'They were playing games, not racing and were not excessively fast.'

Lisa Woodrow, a passenger in Mr Mirza’s car, saw the Mercedes swerve before it hit the Micra.

Mr Kellet said: 'Her response to the collision was, "That’s what happens when you mess around on roads.”’

Meppen-Walter got out of his car and tried to help the injured, waving his arms saying, "What have I done!"

Mr Singh and his sister Ms Kaur were pronounced dead at the scene.

Her son Amjit Singh, was unconscious but her other son Harveen was conscious, crying and asking for his mother, the court heard.

Police initially investigated whether Meppen-Walter from Blackley, Manchester was racing a friend in a VW Golf as both cars appeared to be accelerating and slowing down apparently to avoid speed cameras.

But they later ruled out the racing line of inquiry and freed the other driver without charge.

Today the £1,000 a week defender who has been at City since 2003 and has represented England at under-17 level broke and wept as was given 16 months jail and banned from driving for three years.

After the case Sgt Danny Byrne, from Greater Manchester Police said:

'What this case tragically highlights is that every time someone gets behind the wheel of a car, the driver has to have 100 percent concentration, they must adhere to the speed limits and respect the laws of the road.

'There can be absolutely no room for risks or "showboating". A car can be a lethal weapon and sadly that has been borne out and taken Kulwant and Ravel away from their loving family forever.

'No family should have to suffer such a devastating loss in these circumstances. I can only hope now the case has concluded that they can try and move forward with their lives.'

At the time Mr Singh's was driving his sister and her children home from a Sikh temple and was due to return to collect his wife and their two children, aged one and three.

His lawyer Gwyn Lewis said in 
mitigation: 'It has to be said that this type of case should always be 
called tragic. Tragic for the family that lost their loved ones and also
tragic for the defendant.

'He
became involved in a matter that only took a few seconds but it will 
remain with him for the rest of his life. He is truly sorry for his 
actions. He was sorry when he was at the scene and he said 'what have I 
done?' staying at the scene for over an hour trying to help anyway he 
could.

'We heard about him jostling for position. It was childish behaviour but it wasn't dangerous. It was being carried out because the defendant's mobile phone lost charge and he was giving directions to the other driver, shouting instructions of where to go.

'But even though it was that childish behaviour there was a period of time - 10-15 seconds at most - where he moved from being a child to being adult quickly.

'He assisted at the scene. He has shown personal remorse - it is genuine. He is a young man who certainly had a promising football career.

"He played for the under 18s international matches and he had played for England 17 times. He was captain for the under 18s side. He had a promising future at Manchester City.

'He is a young man that wishes he could have those 10 seconds back but he can't. He's faced up to the matter by accepting his responsibilities.'

Passing sentence Judge Martin Steiger QC said: 'There are a number of aggravating factors - two deaths and serious injuries to the children and the defendant was speeding earlier.

'He had been seen jockeying and that activity in my judgement says that the speeding was not an isolated act.'

Outside court Kushwant Kaur, Kulwant's wife, said: 'The driver has taken away my loving husband and father to my two children. Our life has been destroyed.

'Kulwant was more than anything I have ever loved in my life, nothing can replace him. I am pleased that justice has been done and I hope that this will teach him so no family has to go through what myself and my family have been through this past few months, and will continue to go through for the rest of our lives.'

Gawa Singh, brother to both Kulwant and Ravel, also said: 'Not only has this incident taken away two loved members of our family- it has also affected in such a big way the people left behind.

'Our lives had begun to improve and we were looking forward to a brighter future, now all that has been taken from us. Nothing will bring back our brother and sister and any sentence given by the courts will make our lives any better.

'People who kill on the roads should be banned from driving forever so that they can never do this again to another person.

'We are reminded daily about the loss of our brother and sister, he should be reminded every day too by not having the luxury of having the use of a car.'
