Australia 108 will be the tallest tower to roofline in the southern hemisphere when it is completed in 2019

Melbourne architects have received the green-light to build a 100-storey skyscraper, which will be the tallest apartment block in the southern hemisphere.

At 319 metres high the tower, Australia 108, will be the highest residential tower in the southern hemisphere, when it is completed in 2019, beating out Melbourne's Eureka tower by 22 metres.

The Q1 Gold Coast building beats the Australia 108 because of a spire which reaches 323 metres, but the Melbourne building will have the tallest roof line.

It will also be the tallest habitable building in the country, with apartments up to the 100th level, whereas the Q1 only has 71 habitable levels.

Australia 108 received Victorian State Government approval today and construction should commence in mid-2015 and be completed in 2019, costing an estimated $900 million to build.

The building had to undergo a dramatic re-design last year when the original 388 metre-high design was found to breach air safety regulations.

The building, designed by Fender Katsalidis Architects, will contain 1,105 luxury apartments, as well as retail tenancies, a multi-level carpark and communal facilities for residents, including pool, gym, sauna, steam room and private theatre.

The building features 'golden starbursts' at levels 70 and 71, which are meant to complement the 'golden crown' of the nearby Eureka Building, also designed by Fender Katsalidis.

The 'starbursts' house luxury services accessible to residents, including infinity pools that overlook Melbourne form a height of 210 metres.

The tower will be built on the south bank of Melbourne on a site bought in December 2013 by Aspial's World Class Land, a Singapore based developer.
