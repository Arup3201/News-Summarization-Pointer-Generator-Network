Red Bull’s design guru Adrian Newey has been accused of lying by the boss of the team’s engine suppliers, Renault.

The relationship between the two sides of the partnership that took Sebastian Vettel to his four world titles has disintegrated in recent weeks with Newey and Red Bull team principal Christian Horner both expressing their frustration at Renault’s slow development rate.

Newey, 56, told the Mail on Sunday that there was ‘no light at the end of the tunnel’ for the team and accused Renault of failing to engage with them to find a solution.

Renault managing director Cyril Abiteboul mischievously posted a picture of boxing gloves on Wednesday 

Those comments have angered Renault managing director Cyril Abiteboul, who told French motorsport magazine Auto Hebdo: ‘It’s difficult to have a partner who lies. Adrian is a charming man and an engineer without parallel, but he’s spent his life criticising engine partners. He’s too old to change his ways.’

Abiteboul later tweeted a picture of a pair of boxing gloves and boots. 'Packing up to Malaysia. Race (round?) 2', he mischievously posted. 

Horner claimed after the opening race in Melbourne, when his cars were considerably off the pace all weekend, that the Renault engine was 100bhp short of Mercedes. He also ruled out a victory this season.

Daniel Ricciardo finished a lowly sixth at the season opener, one lap behind race winner Lewis Hamilton 

But in a statement from Renault ahead of this weekend’s Malaysian Grand Prix, Abiteboul shared the blame around, saying: ‘We need to work together to understand our issues, both within the power unit and the chassis. Our figures have shown that the lap time deficit between Red Bull and Mercedes in Melbourne was equally split between driveability issues, engine performance and chassis performance.

‘It’s therefore the overall package that needs some help and we have been working with the team to move forward.

‘We’ve been particularly aggressive in development and we should see the results a lot more clearly in Malaysia. Work is still ongoing but even now we are in a completely different place from where we finished Melbourne.’

Mischievously, the FIA have called Horner and Abiteboul to appear together at the official press conference in the Kuala Lumpur paddock on Friday.
