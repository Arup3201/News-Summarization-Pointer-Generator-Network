Sukhdeo was unable to react in time as the piece of rubber bounced along at high-speed.

Recalling the incident, he told CP24 News: 'I saw the tire just as it bounced for the first time and I was trying to calculate where it was going to come down.

'But everything was just happening so quickly that there was just no time to react or think. I just kind of ducked.'
