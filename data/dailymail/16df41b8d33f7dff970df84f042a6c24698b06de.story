Michael Owen's horse Brown Panther withdrew at the last minute from the Canadian International after the former Liverpool legend had made the 3,400 mile journey see the race. 

It was set to be a whistle-stop tour for Owen who only planned to be in Canada for a matter of hours due his commitments working as a co-commentator.

'I'm commentating on Manchester City vs Tottenham on Saturday, fly straight out to Canada, get there about lunchtime on Sunday, watch the race and then fly back out that evening and get back for the Monday night match which I'm also working on,' Owen told Racing UK.

Brown Partner, owned and bred by Owen, secured his first Group 1 when winning the Irish St Leger last month and was looking for another top-level victory in Canada before his withdrawal. 

Owen could not contain his excitement at seeing the Tom Dascombe-trained six-year-old in action tweeting earlier in the week: 'Canada here I come', but Owen's long-haul trip proved for nothing as his horse was forced out of action minutes before the off. 

The ex-England striker took to Twitter to voice his disappointment stating: 'Long way to come for nothing!' 

Owen was full of excitement before making the mammoth journey to see his horse race in Canada 

But Owen's joy quickly turned to disappointment after Brown Panther pulled out moments before the race
