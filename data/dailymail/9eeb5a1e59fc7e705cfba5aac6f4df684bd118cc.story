A formerly obese man has transformed his life after being inspired to get fit by boxer Ricky Hatton.

Simon Huyton, 38, a computer programmer from Leigh, Greater Manchester, has lost 10st in just 10 months.

At his heaviest, Simon weighed over 25st and struggled to do basic things like walk up the stairs.

Changed his ways: Simon dropped from 25st 2lb (left) to 15st (right) by totally revamping his diet and embarking on a fitness regime

He feared for his health as his father had died from an obesity-related illness. 

Simon explained: 'When I was 14 years old, my father sadly passed away from a heart condition which was related to his weight.

'I could see myself slowly heading in the same direction and I knew something needed to be done.'

Simon found inspiration for his weight loss from an unusual place.  

'I started following Ricky Hatton on Twitter, who would often post inspirational tweets about his training in preparation for a fight coming up,' he said. 

'He was overweight at the time and trying to lose weight. He kept posting funny things like images from the film Run Fat Boy Run and it made me giggle. I started thinking I could do that, I can lose weight.' 

Due to his size, Simon was too embarrassed to go to the gym so he purchased a press trainer and a monkey gym which he kept in his garage at home. 

Inspiration: Ricky Hatton gave Simon the push he needed to get in shape after he followed him on Twitter

Fat to fit: Simon has gone from struggling to climb the stairs to an exercise fanatic in under a year 

'I just locked myself away for 10 months really. I gave up drinking and all my unhealthy snacks.

'I used to be a champion at lying still. I work from home and I used to get my shops delivered and sometimes would barely leave the house for weeks.

'Everyday stuff was hard. Even just climbing the stairs I would get sweaty and out of breath.  

'I wasn't happy with the way I looked but I wouldn't really admit that to anyone.'

Simon decided to drastically change his diet, ditching the highly processed foods he was living off, such as pies, cereal, sandwiches and frozen chips, in favour of more wholesome foods.

He now eats a high protein diet with lots of chicken, rice, sweet potatoes and fresh vegetables. 

As the weight dropped off Simon gained enough confidence to join his local gym and began to gradually increase his exercise. 

Then and now: Simon says he is the fittest he has ever been, right

Simon now works out most days, only taking a day off when he feels the need to. 

An average day will see him working out at least twice, doing a variety of different exercises such as swimming in the morning, a weights session at lunch and exercise classes at the gym in the evening.

He explains: 'I try and mix up my exercise. I've fallen in love with running outdoors so I do a lot of that. I'm fitter than I've ever been before in my life. '

After losing over 10st, he signed up for the urban obstacle assault course, Men's Health Survival of the Fittest, run by company Rat Race, to help keep him motivated and to give him a target to work towards.

Simon said: 'The Survival of the Fittest course was gruelling but great fun and I am very proud to say that I completed it in 1 hour and 23 minutes - so all my hard work and training certainly paid off. 

Breakfast: Cereal or eggs and bacon, with lots of toast 

Lunch: A pie or sandwich or trip to chip shop

Dinner: Frozen meals such as chicken and chips 

Snacks: Sweets and several packs of crisps a  day. Lots of fizzy drinks 

Breakfast: A protein shake with flax and chia seeds or porridge with a banana

Lunch: Chicken, mashed sweet potato and vegetables 

Dinner: An omelette made with chicken and salad 

Snacks: Fresh fruit 

'Having an event like this to work towards provided me with the motivation I needed to keep training and it in turn helped me to maintain my weight loss. 

'I'm much happier with my body now. I don't think I'll ever be totally happy with myself though, even though a few people say I should be now. 

'I spend so long being ridiculously self conscious and I just got used to people looking down on my because I was so over weight. 

'I still have work to do on my body but I do realise it will take time and there is no quick fix.

'I really hope that by telling my story I can now inspire others who are in a similar situation to what I was to lead a healthier lifestyle as it is the best thing I ever did'. 

The next Survival of the Fittest is set to take place in London on the 22nd November which will see Wembley Park transformed into a colossal 10km urban assault course.
