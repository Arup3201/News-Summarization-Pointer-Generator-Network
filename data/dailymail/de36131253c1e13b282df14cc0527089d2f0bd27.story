An art gallery has a new star attraction after an artist claimed to have hidden an £8,000 cheque among its exhibits.

Artist Tomas Georgeson has hidden the blank cheque in one of Milton Keynes Gallery's public spaces in the hope it will attract more visitors.

Mr Georgeson, who previously worked as a volunteer at the gallery, hopes the potential windfall will boost interest in local art and break down a 'disconnect' between the attraction and the public.

Treasure hunt: Olly Hemans searches for the blank cheque that has been hidden at Milton Keynes Gallery by one of its artists

Star attraction: Lewis Bennett, 19, tries to discover the hiding place of the cheque which has been made out for £8,000 with the name left blank

Lucky day: Whoever discovers the cheque at Milton Keynes Gallery can write it out to themselves

He told The Daily Telegraph: 'It won’t bounce if somebody finds the cheque and cashes it.

'I’m prepared to live with the consequences of that happening, and I could only be prepared if I thought it would really do some good.'

The Buckinghamshire-based artist is planning to collect the cheque on March 1 if it has not been found.

He has placed an advert in the local 
newspaper, The Milton Keynes Citizen, which reads: 'A blank cheque for 
£8,000 has been hidden somewhere in the public spaces of Milton Keynes 
Gallery. It will be collected on 1 March 2013 if unclaimed.'

Well hidden: The cheque has been hidden within the public spaces of the gallery so visitors have no reason to touch the exhibits

Deadline: Visitors only have one month to find the cheque as the artist plans to remove it on March 1

Be careful: The gallery has urged visitors not to touch the exhibits while searching for the cheque

Milton Keynes Gallery’s communications director, Katharine Sorensen, was only made aware of the artist’s claims when she was contacted by a reporter yesterday.

Ms Sorensen said: 'I put the phone down and went and had a look (around the gallery) with colleagues and couldn’t see anything.

'It’s not something we know about and we can’t confirm or deny whether it’s a hoax or not.'

Ms Sorensen said the director of the gallery had made contact with Mr Georgeson after news of his offer broke.

'He (Mr Georgeson) says he has placed something in the gallery, but that it is not underneath or on any artwork so there is no need for anyone to touch the actual exhibits,' Ms Sorensen added.

Publicity stunt: Tomas Georgeson said he hopes the cheque will hope attract more visitors to Milton Keynes Gallery in Buckinghamshire

In the press: Mr Georgeson placed an advertisement in a local newspaper to raise awareness of the cheque

Secret: The gallery's communication manager Katherine Sorensen was unaware of the cheque until an advertisement in the local newspaper

Looking for clues: The cheque hasn't been hidden underneath any artwork
