A worried neighbour of two toddlers, allegedly murdered by their mother in an exorcism ritual, called police the night before they were killed to report a child had been left in a car for 45 minutes.

One-year-old Norell Harris and his two-year-old sister, Zyana, were found dead in their beds at their home in Germantown, Maryland on Friday morning.

Their mother, Zakieya Avery, 28 and another woman Monifa Sanford, 21, who had been staying with the family, have been charged with their murder and the attempted murder of their older brother and sister.

Yesterday Montgomery County police 
released recordings of two 911 calls made by concerned neighbours, one 
on Thursday night and the second on Friday morning.

In
 the first call, made on Thursday at around 10.15pm, the neighbour
 is heard saying: 'I have a baby in the car that's been here for 45 
minutes.'

He then tells the receptionist that two women were coming after him.

He is then heard saying: 'Back up off me, ma'am. That is my business, a kid in the car for an hour that is my business.'

The caller later claims that the woman was 'talking to herself'.

Police
 said they did respond to that first call, but when they arrived at the 
address the women and the children were already inside, and they did not
 persue the matter.

They said they had reported the incident to Child Protective Services who were due to call round on Friday morning.

Infanticide: Zakieya Latrice Averyhas been charged with murder in the deaths of two of her children, a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old

Concerns: A neighbour of the family called 911 to report a child left inside a car outside the home for 45 minutes the night before it is believed they were killed in an exorcism ritual

The
 second 911 call was received at 9.23am on Friday. A different neighbour
 reported hearing noises the previous night and then finding a knife 
with blood on it inside a parked car.

The
 caller says: 'In the car outside there is a knife with blood. The car 
has the door open, the house has windows open up there.

'I
 heard loud noises in the night, I just woke up. I heard, like, jumping.
 I didn't know, they have 4 children, so I don't know if the kids are 
just doing that every day.'

'So
 I didn't know. I just didn't think anything. I took my kids to school 
and I saw the knife with blood outside, I see the car with the door 
open, I see the windows open. I don't know if something happened there. 
The knife is still there.'

Tragically
 later that morning police discovered the two youngsters dead and their 
five-year-old and eight-year-old siblings suffering from stab wounds.

Their mother, Zakieya Avery, 28, faces two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.

According to Montgomery County police captain Marcus Jones, Avery told detectives she 'thought the devil was in the kids.'

'That's
 sort of the thing she centered it around as to why she had to conduct 
an exorcism,' he said. 'She just thought that there were evil spirits 
within the kids.'

Avery was arrested when authorities say she tried to flee from a 
townhouse near the vehicle. Police found the two children dead inside 
the home, and their siblings and Sanford were taken to the hospital with
 injuries.

Police said Sanford was arrested Saturday after being released from the hospital.

Arrest: Zakieya Avery is being held without bond charged with the murder and the attempted murder of her children

The
 tragedy unfolded at around 9.30 a.m. Friday when police officers 
responded to a home in the 1900 block of Cherry Bend Drive, where they 
came upon a 'very bloody scene' involving six people, four of them 
children under the age of 10. 

The two youngest children were pronounced dead at the scene.

Yesterday the children's grandmother Ida Johnson, 90, told of her shock, describing the two young victims as the 'sweetest things'.She said: 'I
 will cherish those memories forever,' she told MailOnline. 'Their lives
 were cut short and they had no say so whatsoever. It doesn't make 
sense.'

Mrs Johnson said the children's father, her grandson, Martin Luther Harris Jr. has traveled to 
the Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. to be with his
 surviving son and daughter who were both listed in stable condition 
Sunday.

Johnson said she didn't know if Avery had a history of violence or when the woman's relationship with Harris deteriorated.

'I don't know what was going on between the family, all I know is they were sweet kids,' she said.

The
 great-grandmother added: 'It's heartbreaking. Something should be done 
about who did it. But at the same time, it's not going to bring the 
children back. I just hope they get (what they deserve).'

Avery's stepgrandmother, Sylvia Wade, told The Washington Post that Avery was 'humble and meek' and said she loved her children.

'I
 don't know what triggered it,' she said. 'She wasn't herself. When a 
person is not of themselves, they are not responsible for what they are 
doing. They are in another zone.'

Startling change: Police arrested Monifa Denise Sanford, 21 (pictured at her arrest at right and earlier at left) Saturday following her release from a hospital and charged her with two counts of first degree murder and two counts of attempted first degree murder

The other woman charged in the killings, Monifa Denise Sanford, 21, made similar 
statements about evil spirits during questioning, police said. The two 
women had been living together at the house in recent months.

Jones said the women are believed to have met each other at a church, which he identified as Exousia Ministries in Germantown.

The
 pastor of that congregation, Darryl Jones, declined to discuss the case
 after services at an elementary school Sunday or even confirm that the 
women worshipped there.

'This
 is a tragic situation. We're keeping the family in (our) prayers and we
 are respecting the privacy of the family,' he said.

Both
 women were being held without bond on charges of first-degree murder 
and attempted first-degree murder and are not expected to appear in 
court until Tuesday afternoon. Court records do not list lawyers for the
 women.

Sinister ritual: Norell Harris, a 1-year-old boy (second left), and Zyana Harris, a 2-year-old girl (third left), were found dead in Germantown, Maryland, Friday, while their older siblings (pictured) suffered multiple stab wounds during what was described as an exorcism

Unthinkable: The tragedy unfolded at around 9.30am Friday when police officers responded to a home in the 1900 block of Cherry Bend Drive, where they came upon a 'very bloody scene' involving six people (Sanford among them), four of them children under the age of 10

Grisly sight: Police who went into a home in Germantown on Friday morning encountered a 'very bloody scene' and discovered two children dead, and two other children and a woman injured

Martin Luther
 Harris Jr. relocated to Los Angeles after he separated from Avery.

His mother, Alonda Lord, changed her Facebook profile to a picture of the four children Saturday.

Horrific detail: According to reports, the children may have been sleeping in their rooms when they were stabbed

'Cases like this are heartbreaking' said Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger. 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims along with the 911 operators, police officers, evidence technicians, and fire and EMS personnel that responded,' according to the station WUSA9.

According to her Facebook page, Avery lives with her family in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and works as a pharmacy technician.  

Most recently, she wished happy New Year to her family on January 2. In mid-November, the 28-year-old indicated that she was in a new relationship.
