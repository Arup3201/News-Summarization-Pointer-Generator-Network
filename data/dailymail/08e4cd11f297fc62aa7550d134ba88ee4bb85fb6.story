For years, it was the one that got away. 

But this 150-year-old halibut’s luck is finally over after it was caught off the coast of Norway, weighing a whopping 31 stone.

The giant fish is 20 times the average weight for the species and could feed more than 500 people.

The huge creature has been shipped to Hull, Yorkshire, where anglers have used its mammoth weight to estimate its age.

Fish merchant Dean Roberts, who has landed the giant catch, said: ‘It’s a bit of a monster.

‘This one has got to be about 150 years old. It’s about a kilo for every year of growth and it weighs 27 stone, or 169kg, without its head.

‘It’s got away with not being caught for a very long time.’

Mr Roberts has already had a lot of interest from restaurants desperate for a fillet of the record-breaking fish and he is hoping to fetch more than £1,500 for the huge halibut.

He said: ‘Halibut is a much sought-after fish. It’s mainly a restaurant commodity. A lot of big restaurants in London sell it.’

After it is processed and filleted by his buyer, a fish merchant in Fleetwood, it could fetch as much as £3,000.

Mr Roberts, who co-owns fish merchant 
Norstar, said: ‘All the fish we sell come from a sustainable source. 
This was caught on a hook and a line.

'The hooks are baited, they put 
them over the side and a few hours later they bring them back in.

'It’s a
lot better for the environment and a better way of fishing.’

But despite its size, the huge fish is not quite as large as the largest halibut ever caught.

In July, German Marco Liebenow caught a 37-stone whopper.

It took 90 minutes to reel the 9ft long fish towards the surface, as it was too big to haul on to his small boat in Norway.

The previous largest halibut was caught in 2010 by veteran German angler Günther Hansel, 70, who reeled in a 34-stone (220kg) monster, which was sold for £2,000.
