One morning single mother Lucy Rocca awoke in a hospital bed with no recollection of how she'd got there.

The shocking truth was the then 35 year old had collapsed on her doorstep the night before while smoking a cigarette after downing three bottles of wine.

She was rushed to A&E thanks to a friend who happened to be passing her house in Sheffield and spotted her slumped body.

Beat the booze: Lucy Rocca says she's happier now she no longer drinks and wants to help other people beat alcohol addiction

The fact that she had drunk so much on a night at home alone was not unusual. Lucy told the MailOnline she had become accustomed to drinking two to two-and-half bottles of wine on an evening at home or when out with friends.

But her trip to hospital was the wake up call she needed to change her ways.

She said: 'I grew up with the Nineties ladette culture. Going out and getting drunk was the norm in my twenties and continued into my thirties. I could never have just one or two drinks.

'As I got older and had a daughter and then divorced, drinking became a coping mechanism for stress release. Some nights I would drink more than two bottles of wine.

'Waking up in hospital was the wake up call I needed. I couldn't carry on the way I was'

Lucy realised she had become too dependent on alcohol and sought help for her addiction. However, aside from Alcoholics Anonymous, which she didn't want to join, she found there was little support for women like her.

She said: 'The AA works for some people but you have to commit to attending meetings and as a single mum, I couldn't do that. It wasn't right for me, especially as I didn't feel I had a hardcore addiction.'

With the support of a friend, who also gave up alcohol at the same time and a new partner, Lucy was able to beat her addiction.

She said: 'I found other activities to fill my time. I stopped going to the pub and I took up running which became my stress release. I broke the habits I had formed around drinking.'

Lucy found the more she avoided alcohol the better she felt about herself and she became a better parent to her daughter, now aged 14.

She said: 'It wasn't a case of her 
being neglected. She rarely saw me drunk as it was always in the 
evenings but it still had an insidious effect. I was always hungover so I
 was grumpy and had no energy to do things like help her with her 
homework or take her swimming. I was always muddling through with a 
hangover. I'm a much better parent now.'

Problem: Some users seeking help from the website Soberistas, many of whom are mothers, are consuming two to three bottles of wine a night

But Lucy, now 37, still found the process 
of battling the bottle could sometimes be a lonely experience. She began
 to write a blog in April 2011 sharing her feelings and then the idea 
was born to launch a website where people like her could come together 
and support one another.

She launched Soberistas last November as a place for 'people who 
are trying to resolve their problematic drinking patterns, and people 
who have successfully kicked the booze'.

A
 forum, blog and articles offering advice and support are all available 
to members - many of whom are middle-aged, middle class mothers.

More
 than 1,500 members have already signed up and Lucy 
believes 90 per cent of them are mothers aged 30-50 who are in a similar
 place to where she once was.

As
 well as increasing their risk of a drunken accident that could result 
in them waking up in hospital like Lucy did two years ago, these women 
are also in 
danger of ruining their long-term health with alcohol abuse raising 
their chance of getting a serious illness like liver disease.

Support: The website aims to help people via their forum, blog and articles

The
 Soberistas forum is also rife with the experiences of those who have 
lost their jobs or damaged their relationships with friends and family 
due to their alcohol dependency.

The NHS recommend that women should 
not regularly drink more than 2 to 3 units of alcohol a day. But many 
are exceeding these guidelines on nights out or when drinking alone at 
home.

Soberistas aims to 
help these people by giving them a place where they can 'talk, write, 
offload, and share' their experiences with like-minded people.

Lucy, who no longer drinks any 
alcohol, hopes the website can help people create a better life for 
themselves like she has done.

She said: 'You can't stay that way, you have to have an open mind to change and open yourself up to new experiences.

'I enjoy not drinking now, I have 
grown as a person and discovered there is much more to life than getting
 drunk. I don't miss drinking at all.'
