The U.S. Navy's newest ship has been unveiled as a floating tribute to the passengers who lost their lives when Flight 93 has hijacked by terrorists on September 11 2001.

The USS Somerset is filled with reminders of that tragic day including a quilt bearing the names of the 40 passengers and crew on Flight 93 who stormed the cockpit of the hijacked airliner, forcing it to crash in a Southwestern Pennsylvania field but thwarting an attack on Washington D.C.

The ship takes its name from Somerset County where the plane crashed killing everybody aboard while the ship's mess has been named 'Heroes Hall'.

But the warship also bears a physical link with the tragic event after which it was named, 22 tons of steel from a large crane near the crash site was melted down and used to build the sternhold.

Captain Thomas Dearborn, the ship's commanding officer, said: 'Had it not been for their heroic actions, the terrorists would have reached their intended targets, and for sure, countless more lives would've been lost and perhaps even changed the outcome of history as we know it.'

Sailors 
who were in their teens or even younger during the 2001 terror attack said it's a 
great honor to serve aboard the diesel-powered, 684-foot Somerset, an 
amphibious transport dock designed to carry troops and equipment and 
launch helicopters, tilt-rotor aircraft and assault watercraft.

Petty Officer Patricia Steele, 27, of Oak Harbor, Washington, was in her ninth-grade science class when two passenger planes slammed into the World Trade Center. She remembers watching the towers fall on TV.

'We sat rigid in our seats, couldn't move, couldn't believe what was going on,' she recalled.

Steele said she's honored to serve on the Somerset because the Flight 93 passengers were 'the first crew that fought back against terrorism.

'They fought back to preserve and protect innocent lives.'

Sailors were getting the Somerset ready Thursday in advance of the commissioning ceremony, swabbing an already spotless upper deck in front of the bridge as a bitter wind howled.

The Navy showed off the Somerset's capabilities, having an Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and a SuperCobra attack helicopter land on the flight deck in the shadow of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.

Saturday's ceremony will feature the ship's sponsor giving the traditional order to 'man our ship and bring her to life'. The Somerset will then sail to San Diego, its home port.

It's the third ship to be named in honor of 9/11 victims and first responders. The others are the USS New York and USS Arlington.

Among other references to Flight 93, a plaque on the Somerset says: 'The sailors and Marines of this warship will never forget', the mess is called 'Heroes Hall', a patch sewn into a tablecloth bears the legend 'Let's roll,' the famous rallying cry of Flight 93 passenger Todd Beamer.

Hamilton Peterson, of Bethesda, Maryland, the son of Donald Peterson and Jean Peterson, who died aboard Flight 93, plans to attend the commissioning ceremony with his two sons.

The Somerset 'represents that ethos of not lying down, of fighting back,' said Peterson, the former chairman of the Families of Flight 93 group.

The vessel was christened in July 2012 at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Avondale, a New Orleans suburb.
