Rory McIlroy perused social media and the television sports bulletins on Wednesday night and was aghast at what he found.

There,
 he was described as having said Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods were 
washed up, and their day had come and gone. Which was, quite frankly, a 
travesty.

Asked
 a straightforward question about the absence of the two superstars from
 the Tour Championship for the first time since 1992, he gave a 
typically straightforward answer. ‘They’re just getting older,’ he 
responded. ‘Phil is 43 or whatever he is (he is 44) and Tiger is nearly 
40. So they’re getting into the sort of last few holes of their 
careers.’

Rory McIlroy defended comments he made about Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson

Given Mickelson has been a pro for 23 years and Tiger for 19, it seemed a statement of the obvious, albeit a candid one. But do we want all  players just to speak in stock cliches and say nothing? Thank goodness McIlroy did not feel the need to backtrack on Twitter. He was just  anxious to clear up any misconceptions.

‘Got a question today about Tiger and Phil,’ he tweeted. ‘Gave an honest answer, was very complimentary about the 2 best golfers of this generation….golfers on average have a 20-25 year career, both into the back 9 of their careers….don’t think there is anything wrong with saying that.’

There is not. But the resultant palaver was hardly the ideal preparation before beginning his mission to win the Tour Championship, the FedEx Cup, and their bountiful joint rewards of $11.44million.
