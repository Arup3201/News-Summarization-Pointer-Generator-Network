The 'one millionth Chevrolet Corvette', which was sucked into a sinkhole that opened up beneath Kentucky's National Corvette Museum earlier this year, is gearing up for restoration.

As many as 25 workers will restore the vehicle over the next six months or 'however long it takes to make sure it's done right', said David Bolognino, director of GM Design Fabrication at the Warren, Michigan facility where the car was displayed on Wednesday.

The white vehicle, which was constructed in 1992, was the one millionth Corvette to roll off the assembly line and is worth more than $750,000, according to Car and Driver.

It was one of eight luxury cars that plunged into a massive 30-foot sinkhole that opened beneath the museum in Bowling Green in February. Of those, just three can be restored.

On Wednesday, General Motors and Chevrolet showed off the car at the special facility in Warren ahead of its restoration, which experts hope they can complete by next June.

But it won't be an easy task - the 1992 car is just old enough that it will be hard to find or create replacement parts, CNN reported. 

It is estimated that the car suffered around $30,000 in damage. General Motors will cover the cost of restoring the vehicle.

Expert restorers will also be forced to preserve as much as they can of the salvaged car so that it remains as true to its original form as possible to 'preserve as much authenticity as possible'.

'The parts we have a choice on, we will always err on repairing them,' Bolognino said, the Detroit News reported.

The car, which is still covered in dirt and gravel, suffered heavy damage to its rear suspension and its front fender and the windshield was completely smashed.

It also suffered a broken taillight on the rear of the car and the whole vehicle is covered in scratches. Still, it went relatively unscathed compared to other vehicles that were reduced to metal skeletons.

The car is also the most valuable of the three cars that can be saved. Another, a 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil, was recently finished.

A third vehicle that can be fixed, a 1962 black Corvette, is too old for General Motors to handle and will handpick a team of specialists to put it back together.

Five further cars were completely destroyed and cannot be saved: a 1984 PPG pace car, a 1993 ruby red 40th anniversary Corvette, a 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 Corvette, the 2009 white '1.5 millionth Corvette' and a 1993 ZR-1 Spyder. 

Unbelievable: Of the eight cars that fell into the sinkhole at the Kentucky museum, just three can be salvaged

Massive task: The sinkhole is now being filled and should be completed by July. Since the freak accident, it has become somewhat of a tourist attraction, with the number of visitors rocketing since February

Of those that plunged into the hole, only the 1 Millionth Corvette, the 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil and the 1962 Black Corvette could be saved.

As well as the restorations, a team is also working to fill the sinkhole in a $3.2 million project which is set to be completed by July.

The hole opened up when the museum was closed, and no one was injured. 

And despite losing valuable cars, the museum has turned the freak accident into a money maker after a video of the incident was shared on YouTube and viewed millions of times.

The sinkhole became a popular attraction. People gawking at the hole revved up attendance and revenue at the museum, an hour north of Nashville, Tennessee.

The museum cashed in by selling sinkhole-themed T-shirts, videos, postcards, and jars filled with sinkhole dirt and tiny pieces of car parts. 

The hole will be filled completely with rock, then workers will drill into it to install steel casings, museum officials said.

Crews will pour grout into the casings, creating a steel and concrete pillar to provide additional support under the floor.

The museum now plans to memorialize the sinkhole in exhibits. 

Glory days: The car was the one millionth Corvette to roll of the assembly line and was donated to the National Corvette Museum by General Motors. It has been valued at more than $750,000
