A mother has been handed with a 12-month ban from the roads after she was caught drink-driving on the afternoon school run.

Shamed Christine Green was caught more than two and half times the legal limit after quaffing wine with her lunch.

The 43-year-old had been on the way to pick up her children from school when she was pulled over by police on May 2, this year.

Shamed: Christine Green, 43, representing herself in court, apologised and vowed: 'I'm never going to do it again'

Officers found she had 88 microgrammes of alcohol in her breath - more than twice the drink-drive limit of 35 microgrammes.

Green was arrested in Verwood, Dorset, less than half a mile from her house.

Representing herself in court, she apologised and vowed: 'I'm never going to do it again.

'I had a drink the night before and stupidly had a couple of glasses of wine with my lunch.

'I didn't realise I was going to push myself so far over the limit. I'm really sorry.'

The court heard how Green had already three points on her licence following a speeding offence last year.

As well as being disqualified from driving, Green was fined £250 and ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs.

She was offered the chance to pay to take part in a drink-driving rehabilitation course which would reduce her ban by three months.

Dorset police traffic inspector Matt Butler said: 'Drink driving is extremely dangerous and entirely unacceptable. This case shows that offenders will be caught.

'Drink driving is one of the "fatal four" factors in road traffic collisions, alongside speed, driver distractions and not wearing a seat belt.'
