A record surge in employment means in one town almost no-one is on the dole.

In the Staffordshire market town of Uttoxeter just 34 people are claiming Jobseekers Allowance, it emerged today.

And with a Waitrose supermarket about to open, with 180 new jobs, it means unemployment could disappear altogether.

The small town of Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, which dates back to the Domesday Book, has just 34 people claiming Jobseekers Allowance

National figures released yesterday showed nearly one million people got a job over the past year, the biggest annual increase in employment since records began in 1971.

Ministers hailed ‘an important milestone’ in the country’s economic recovery, with more people working in Britain than ever before.

The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance fell by 36,300 in June to 1.04 million, the 20th consecutive monthly fall and the lowest total since 2008.

But in Uttoxeter, which dates back to the Domesday Book and is home to the famous racecourse, there is now just three dozen people claiming the out-of-work benefits.

The town, which has a population of more than 12,000, is famous for its racecourse

Local Tory MP Andrew Griffiths was given the figure by the Department for Work and Pensions to check the figures.

He told the Uttoxeter News: 'These are astounding figures, and only go to demonstrate that the government's long term economic plan is paying huge defends in Uttoxeter.

'Overall, unemployment in my constituency has almost halved in the last four years this Government has been in power, but it is fantastic to discover that it has fallen to such a low level in Uttoxeter.’

Waitrose plans to open a new superstore on the site of a former JCB factory, creating 180 new jobs.

JCB and biscuit makers Fox's in nearby Cheadle are major employers in the area, while the Alton Towers theme park also employs many local people.

Nationally, the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.5 per cent.

Chris Plant, director of Burton and District Chamber of Commerce, which covers Uttoxeter, said: "The labour market is continuing to strengthen, with employment rising, unemployment declining and the number of inactive people also falling.

"These figures demonstrate the resilience and flexibility of the Uttoxeter jobs market and points to continued strong positive growth in the second quarter of this year.

"To build upon these figures, it is important that we see measures to increase productivity and firmer action on youth and long term unemployment.’

David Cameron yesterday hailed the latest employment figures as proof ‘more people have the security of a job than ever before’.

He added: ‘Of course we need to do more to help people by continuing to bring down the cost of government and people's taxes.

‘That's what we have done and what we must continue to do as part of our long-term economic plan.'
