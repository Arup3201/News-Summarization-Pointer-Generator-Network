Liverpool are confident Steven Gerrard will sign a new deal at Anfield even though their captain is free to talk to other clubs from New Year's Day.

Gerrard entered the final six months of his contract at midnight, and the 34-year-old can now negotiate with foreign teams over a move in the summer.

Toronto FC and New York Red Bulls have both expressed a strong interest in taking Gerrard to the MLS. He has also been linked with Inter Milan.

Gerrard, who returns to the starting line-up at home to Leicester City today after he was an unused substitute in Monday’s win over Swansea, is expected to weigh up his options between now and the end of the season, when he will also be able to talk to Premier League clubs.

Asked if he was comfortable with the new situation, manager Brendan Rodgers said: ‘I think he’s earned that respect if he does (talk to other clubs).

‘I’ve got a great relationship and communication with Steven. He’s a wonderful player, a wonderful servant to this football club, and in my time here he’s been brilliant for me.

‘When I came in here two-and-a-half years ago, everyone asked if he could play my type of football or if his legs had gone. You’ve seen him over the last couple of years. He could have been player of the year last season.

‘I’m managing his game time. He understands my situation of picking the best team and making it fresh as often as we can.’

Meanwhile, Rodgers has backed Raheem Sterling to keep his cool in future after the England forward escaped punishment for slapping Swansea defender Federico Fernandez in retaliation on Monday night.

Referee Andre Marriner took no action at the time and the FA were unable to follow up the incident because it had been seen by the match officials.

Rodgers believes the 20-year-old’s ability to ‘make defenders look silly’ will mark him out as a potential target.

‘I’ve been so impressed with Raheem’s ability to deal with pressure,’ added the Liverpool boss. ‘He was 17 years of age when he broke into the team. Of course, there will be moments in the game when the red mist can come across you. I’ve got no qualms about how he can deal with those moments.

‘Teams and players may want to do that but it’s important that you maintain self-control and concentrate on your performance.

Rodgers backed Sterling despite his spat with the Swansea defender on Monday night 

‘It was just an unfortunate incident. They’d been niggling at each other all game. Fernandez is a good defender and when there’s a boy of 20 years of age running away from you all the time, it’s never going to be easy. Raheem can make defenders look really silly, not just with his pace but with his strength.’

Rodgers revealed Liverpool are unlikely to spend in the transfer window although it is believed a loan signing is a possibility.

In an end-of-year message to supporters, chairman Tom Werner said the club’s owners understand their team’s disappointing start to the season following the departure of Luis Suarez and influx of new signings in the summer.

‘As you would expect losing a footballer as capable as Luis Suarez and making a number of new signings, our season has gotten off to a slower start than we would have wanted,’ wrote Lerner. ‘However, in the past few weeks we are pleased to see positive signs as new players start to settle into life at Anfield.’
