A woman with ties to accused killer Aaron Hernandez has died, less than six months after surviving a car crash that killed her partner who was also a member of the ex-footballer’s social circle in his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut.

Tabitha Perry, 27, had previously been interviewed by local law enforcement investigating the June 17 shooting death of Odin Lloyd.

Hernandez, 24, is currently awaiting trial in the 
slaying of 27-year-old Lloyd, an acquaintance whose body was found a
 mile from his home in June. He is
 being held without bail, after pleading not guilty to 
first-degree murder and five-related weapons charges in September.

Tabitha Perry, a member of Aaron Hernandez's social circle in Bristol, Connecticut, died on Monday and had previously been interviewed by cops in connection with the death of Odin Lloyd in June

Authorities responding to a 911 call 
on Monday found Perry, who was visiting a friend in Southampton, 
unconscious and not breathing, reports The Courant.

Her
 death isn’t considered suspicious, but police and the state medical 
examiner's office are awaiting the results of toxicology testing before 
ruling on her cause of death. 

Perry has an extensive criminal record with 22 separate criminal
filings. In 2006 she was found guilty of offenses including possession
and selling drugs and was sentenced to 110 days for operating a motor vehicle while
under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

Numerous other traffic offenses illegally operating a motor
vehicle under influence of alcohol and drugs, driving without insurance,
driving on wrong side of the road, driving while suspended.

Other offenses over the years included breach of the peace, larceny, possession of
liquor by a minor, assault, and resisting arrest.

She was sentenced to an additional nine months in jail in 20122 for violating her probation. In January 2013 she got 120 days for driving while her
license was suspended for DWI.

Perry was injured in the car accident that killed Thaddeus Singleton III, who lost control of his car which crashed into the Farmington Country Club in Connecticut on 28 June.

Perry
 was injured in the car accident that killed Thaddeus Singleton III, who
 lost control of his car which crashed into the Farmington Country Club 
in Connecticut on 28 June.

Singleton
 had a child with Perry, but was married to Tanya Singleton, a cousin of
 Hernandez who is currently in jail after refusing to testify against 
the ex-footballer in August. She faces an accessory charge in Lloyd's death.

Police have described Singleton as the ‘nexus’ of Hernandez's Bristol network, and said that he is the man who connected the former Patriot tight end with his two alleged accomplices, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz.

Wallace and Ortiz, both charged in Lloyd's death, used to stay with Thaddeus and Tanya Singleton at 114 Lake Ave., a Bristol home owned by Hernandez's uncle that has been searched multiple times this summer.

Perry is the third person connected to Hernandez to die since his imprisonment.

Following the death of Thaddeus Singleton III in June, the former New England Patriots star’s uncle Michael J. Valentine, 49, died in August after losing control of his moped and crashing into a curb in Bristol.

The divorced father-of-three was not wearing a helmet when the accident occurred at the intersection of Central Street and Church Avenue and sustained serious head injuries. Valentine was the brother of Hernandez's mother, Terri Hernandez.

Last week it was revealed that the 
former New England Patriots star is enjoying a stress-free existence 
inside the Bristol County House of Corrections, Massachusetts.

‘I’m
 way less stressed in jail than when I was out of jail,’ wrote Hernandez
 in the two-page letter which is dated November 17. ‘I’m just anxious to
 go to trial to see what’s up and prove my innocence.’

Despite
 a note pleading with the recipient - an old friend - to keep his 
correspondence private, the note has found its way into the hands of TMZ.

In
 the letter Hernandez tells his so-called friend that his corrections 
officer ‘hasn’t seen me in a bad mood yet and I really enjoy my days. 
It’s not that bad, honestly.

‘I’m just hoping I am out within these next few years, to get a chance to ball again.’

The former football player claims to have read 25 books since he was incarcerated during the summer

Hernandez also wrote that he’s 
spending his time reading - he claims to have read 25 books since he’s 
being incarcerated - and is 'using this time to become strong, wiser and 
trying to come out, when I come home, way more intelligent, which I 
will.'

Hernandez also admits to some regrets. including that he 'could have made better choices with my 
selected few (friends) but it’s life, you live and learn!'

The
 ex-Patriots star even includes a drawing, the outline of a nude woman 
besides which he wrote ‘Dats a bad b****!!!’ together with a smiley face.

Hernandez
 remains housed in the prison's special management area where 
socializing isn’t allowed.

Prisoners in the area are not allowed to 
have direct contact with each other and only get outside for three hours a
 day.

Sacked: Hernandez had his contract cancelled by the New England Patriots after he was arrested

Four others, including Hernandez's girlfriend and cousin, face charges in the case.

Lloyd,
 a semi-professional player, was found dead less than a mile from his 
home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts on June 17.

Hernandez
 is also being investigated by a grand jury over the deaths of Danny 
Abreu and Safiro Furtado in July 2012, soon after they left a nightclub 
in Boston.
