Telemarketers have found an ingenious way around caller ID, and are using fake identities to get those on the other line to pick up.

The service, which people can use to screen unwanted calls, is backfiring as ‘caller ID spoofing’ is becoming spreads throughout the country.

Telemarketers route a call through the Internet and back to public telephone networks, erasing the call's origin. Likewise, they use software and other inexpensive services to make fake names pop up on caller IDs.

Stop calling: Caller ID spoofing tricks people into picking up their phones by using local numbers and even businesses

Government officials have banned 
telemarketers from hiding their identity, but now the Federal 
Communications Commission may look into new rules to keep up with 
technology.

Sandy Chalmers, a division manager for the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection in Wisconsin issued a warning to those reaching to answer the phone.

‘Do not trust your caller ID,’ she told The New York Times.

‘And if you pick up the phone and someone asks for your personal information, hang up.’

One debt collection agency showed up on a Chicago woman’s caller ID as a string of zeros, a nameless local number, and even ‘Humane Soc.’

‘They want you to pick up that phone 
because you think it’s somebody else or an important call that you’re 
expecting,’ 46-year-old Chicago homemaker Julia Schultz told the Times.

She was called no less than 30 times a week by the agency, cloaked as other organisations.

So how exactly do telemarketers spoof unknowing people into taking their calls?

Officials say technology makes it easier than ever to mask a call’s origin by routing a call through the Internet and then back through public telephone networks.

The Mobile Information Act of 2011, sponsored by U.S. Rep Lee Terry, would effectively revoke a 1991 consumer protection act that prohibits telemarketer calls to cell phones.

It would allow companies to robocall any of the 83 per cent of Americans who now use cell phones. New York Senator Chuck Schumer said he’d do everything in his power to block the proposed bill in the senate.

Companies argue the bill would allow businesses to call customers for ‘informational purposes.’

It would also revoke the FCC’s National Do-Not-Call List.

While many companies use that method to legitimately identify themselves, the technology makes it ripe for telemarketers to create aliases.

Robocalls – where an automated computer allows a telemarketer place thousands of pre-recorded calls a second – has also been on the rise.

The Federal Trade Commission reported they received 140,000 complaints of robocalls in September, up from 61,000 the previous year.

And the technology just keeps getting more sophisticated.

Sometimes, a number will pop up from a legitimate local business, but when the consumer picks up, a telemarketer goes off with a sales pitch.

Consumers have also complained of automated recordings offering to put them on a ‘do not call’ list – but only if they enter their phone number first.

Privacy, please: Sen Chuck Schumer (right) is against the Mobile Information Call Act, which would allow bill collectors and telemarketers to call cell phones

Marguerite Sweeney, who is the head of telephone privacy for the Indiana attorney general, said a scheme like that was probably meant to collect numbers for future telemarketing calls.

Proposed legislation could bring robocalls and spoofing to more and more cell phones, consumer advocates worry, though for now, the problem mostly exists with landlines.

New legislation would open the floodgates to mobile phone robocalls, New York Senator Chuck Schumer warned Sunday.

He said that the Mobile Information Call Act would allow bill collectors and telemarketers to ‘call you on your cell phone during breakfast, lunch, dinner, no matter if you’re at home, at school, at the office.’

Currently, there are laws banning telemarketers from calling cell phones unless the customer gave prior consent.
