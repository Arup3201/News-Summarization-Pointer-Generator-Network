Denmark may be known for its gritty television exports like The Killing, but it is a show with a far more genteel and  quintessentially English feel that is top of the ratings at home.

According to TV bosses in Denmark, the home of the dark and brooding 'Nordic Noir' genre, Danes can't get enough of ITV's quaint 'feelgood' crime drama Midsomer Murders.

Set among the picturesque villages and sedate cricket pitches of Middle England, the series is the best performing 'acquired programme' in Denmark, the chief of the country's biggest channel DR1 has said.

Station chief Kaare Schmidt said, unlike after watching The Killing, audiences are left with a 'good feeling' after watching the genteel English show that proceeds at leisurely pace.

Mr Schmidt told the Radio Times the  long-running series Midsomer, which stars John Nettles and Neil Dudgeon, 'beat everything the competition can come up with' for more than a decade.

As a result, his channel always 'won' the Saturday night ratings battle in Denmark.

'Midsomer Murders is the best performing 
acquired programme of all – that goes for Scandinavia in general but 
especially on Danish television,' he added.

The show is now said to have between 30 and 40 per cent of audience share, being the 'number one big hit' on the corporation's main channel DR1.

Denmark is well-known for its gritty television exports. As well as The Killing, which was so popular it spawned a U.S. remake, Swedish co-production The Bridge also proving popular.

But it is Midsomer that pulls in the ratings.

Mr Schmidt, an acquisitions executive, added that Waking the Dead had also achieved great success, with the British 'especially good' at making crime dramas.

'Midsomer Murders is the best performing acquired programme of all – that goes for Scandinavia in general but especially on Danish television,' he told the Radio Times.

'We have it in the biggest slot for us, which is Saturday night at around 9pm, and it beats everything the competition can come up with, and has been doing so for 12 or 13 years - as long as it's been around.

'We always win Saturday night because of that. And it gets a share of the audience that otherwise only Danish-produced shows can get – between 30 and 40 per cent. It's the number one big hit on our main channel DR1.'

Whodunit: The eight part drama series Broadchurch by Kudos Film and Television for ITV was this year's crime hit

The Danes have not seen this year's big hit, the nail-biting ITV whodunit Broadchurch, starring 
David Tennant and Olivia Colman.

The show became the most 
talked-about crime mystery for more than a decade and fans were left 
racking their brains to identify who killed schoolboy Danny Latimer.

Midsomer, that has a body count of an average 2.6 murders per episode, is based on the books by Caroline Graham and first aired in the UK in 1997.

It is set among fictional villages including Great Pelfe, Midsomer Vertue and Luxton Deeping with the county town of Causton, where Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby lives with his wife and where the Criminal Investigation Department is located.

Many of the villages and small towns of the county have the word Midsomer in their name, which is inspired in part by the real county of Somerset, and specifically the town of Midsomer Norton.

In 2009 John Nettles announced he would retire after the 13th 
series of ten episodes, at the end of 2010.

Neil Dudgeon replaced him in
the 14th series, playing Tom Barnaby's cousin DCI John Barnaby.

The Killing, which was screened in the UK on BBC4, tells the story of dogged 
detective Sarah Lund (Sarah Linden in the remake), investigating a 
murder. Each hour-long episode represents a day of the inquiry.

Audiences were gripped from episode one to 20, and the series went on to win numerous awards including a Bafta.
Even David Cameron gave it the Prime Ministerial seal of approval, 
revealing that he and wife Samantha often watched the series in bed.
