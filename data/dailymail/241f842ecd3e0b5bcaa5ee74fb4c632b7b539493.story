The couple who allegedly had sex in a public pool in front of shocked parents have turned themselves into police.

Myron Helms, 33, and Victoria Cross, 40, of Indiana, made love in Roberts Park Family Pool in Connersville, Indiana, last Sunday, police said.

Helms is a reserve police officer with a neighbouring department. He allegedly had sex with Cross for around 30 minutes in the community pool.

The couple have been charged with 
public indecency after going to the Fayette County Sheriff’s Department,
reported The Smoking Gun.

They were watched by dozens of onlookers at the swimming pool, including several children and their parents.

One concerned adult stood nearby the 
couple ‘to make sure her children didn’t get too close to the subjects,’
a police report said.

After multiple complaints, pool manager Cindy Schwab approached the couple and asked them to stop the alleged act.

According to the Connersville Police 
Department report, Cross then moved away from Helms, which was when 'she
could see the male’s penis'.

Authorities were called and issued Helms and Cross no-trespass orders at the scene.

Cleared: A local sports and activities spokesman said the pool was cleared, workers recycled the whole water system and fresh chemicals were put in

Daryl Drew of Connersville Sports and Activities said the pool was cleared, workers recycled the water system and fresh chemicals were put in.

Helms has been a part-time officer at Laurel Police Department for several years, but has been suspended 
without pay pending the investigation.

Police noted in a report obtained by The Smoking Gun: ‘All the witnesses were visibly disturbed by the incident.’
