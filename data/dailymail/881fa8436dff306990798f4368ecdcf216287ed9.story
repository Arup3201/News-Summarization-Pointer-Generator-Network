A new comic book has launched in India that features a female gang-rape survivor ‘super hero’ who conquers her attackers on the back of a tiger – and its creators hope it will help reduce the number of gender crimes in the country.

Called Priya’s Shakti, its heroine, Priya, battles sexual violence in India with the help of Goddess Parvati.

Creator Ram Devineni wanted to focus the nation’s attention on the difficulty rape victims in India have in bringing their attackers to justice.

Ninety-three women are raped every day in India, according to official statistics 

The co-creator of the comic was spurred on by the brutal fatal rape of a 23-year-old on a bus in Delhi

Very often it’s they, and not the rapists, who become hated by society with many people blaming them for what’s happened.

Mr Devineni told the BBC: ‘I spoke to some gang-rape survivors and they said they were discouraged by their families and communities to seek justice, they were also threatened by the rapists and their families. Even the police didn't take them seriously.’

Such attitudes have led to horrific levels of sexual violence in the country, with 93 women raped every day, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

One of the most shocking recent cases was the brutal gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012.

It was this that spurred Mr Devineni on to help create the comic.

He said: ‘I was in Delhi at the time when the protests broke out and I was involved in some of them. I was talking to a police officer when he said something that I found very surprising. He said “no good girl walks alone at night”.

‘That's where the idea began. I realised that rape and sexual violence in India was a cultural issue, and that it was backed by patriarchy, misogyny and people's perceptions.’

In the comic, which will be free to download at www.priyashakti.com, Priya eventually rides back into her home town, from which she was banished by her parents, on the back of a tiger and conquers her attackers.

To help publicize the project Mr Devineni commissioned Bollywood poster painters and street artists to paint Priya’s Shakti-themed murals in a Mumbai slum. 

The launch of the comic follows the news that New Delhi has banned the ride-sharing service Uber from the city after a woman was allegedly raped by one of its drivers.

Police said they were considering legal action against Uber for failing to run background checks after it emerged the suspect, Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, was arrested for raping a woman three years ago but was later acquitted.

The comic is premiering at the Mumbai Film and Comics Convention from December 19 to 21.
