A 91-year-old World War 2 vet is fighting to prevent his own daughter from evicting him from his home in Zaleski, Ohio.

When John Potter was battling serious illness in 2004 he handed his general power of attorney rights to his daughter Janice Cottrill.

Unbeknownst to Potter, she used that power to convey the deed to the one-story home he built 56 years ago to herself.

When Potter learned of the deed transfer in 2010 he switched power of attorney to his granddaughter, Jaclyn Fraley, now 35.

She hasn’t spoken to her mother and stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to sell her grandfather's home and place him in a nursing home.

Potter has already attempted to sue to get his home back, arguing that his daughter had transferred the deed to herself illegally.

He initially won a county court ruling, but last year an appeals court ruled that because the statute of limitations of four years had passed on the accusation of fraud the deed could not be handed back to Potter.

Early this year Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction notice, saying she they had terminated his 'existing lease'

Early this year, Janice Cottrill and her husband Dean sent her father an eviction notice, saying she they had terminated his ‘existing lease.’

Fraley said her grandfather and her mom argued over visitation rights for Potter's autistic son Joe, who Cottrill took over custody for in 2008.

‘I laid awake at night trying to figure out what in the world I could have done to these people to make them so angry at me,’ he told WCMH.

With an eviction hearing due to take place on June 12, time is running out for the aging vet who fought against the Japanese in the Pacific and also worked as a train dispatcher for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.

Potter turns 92 later this month and his grand-daughter says she would love to be able to give him back the rights to his home for his birthday

In a bid to try and raise the money to buy Potter his home back, granddaughter Fraley has launched a campaign on GoFundMe.com, the crowd-fundraising site.

She has set a goal of raising $125,000 and so far just over $40,000 has been raised in 29 days.

'John Potter just wants to live what remaining life he has left in the home he built with his wife, in which he raised his family, and has lived for the last 56 years,' Fraley wrote on the site.

Potter turns 92 on May 23, and Fraley said she homes she can give his home to him for his birthday so he can stay there for the rest of his life.
