'Is mummy going to come back to life?' 

In what must be a living nightmare, this was the heart-wrenching question asked by Chris Walden's five-year-old son, Cooper, after his mother was tragically killed in a car accident.  

The NewsMail reported how Mr Walden had to tell his son the devastating news that his mother had died in a car crash on Saturday evening, and he wouldn't ever see her again.

Cooper is the youngest of five children Amanda "Mandy" Roberts, 36, leaves behind after she was killed in a horrific car accident near Childers on Saturday evening. Cooper's siblings Brittany, 15, Callum, 14 Riley, 11, and Maddy, 9, were also left grieving the loss of their mother.

Ms Roberts, who lived in Rubyanna, called Mr Cooper earlier that afternoon saying she was going to pick up Cooper from his house - they shared custody of the five-year-old.

'She wanted to pick him up and I had him, and I said 'He's better off just staying with me', which I'm so glad I did,' he said.

'I'm so glad that I kept him now.

'I said 'Just ring him up', so she did and she had a chat with him.'

Just three hours later she was dead. Ms Roberts also leaves behind five siblings, Peter, 32, Jason, 34, Dannielle, 26, Dana, 13, and Sarah, 16.

The crash happened in North Gregory at around 6.45pm when a vehicle travelling on Goodwood Road crossed the road and collided with another vehicle.  

Initial police investigations said a blue 2005 Mitsubishi 380 sedan, being driven by Ms Roberts south along Goodwood Road north of Childers, crossed the road and collided with another vehicle travelling north.

The Mitsubishi then also collided with another north-bound vehicle. Ms Roberts was pronounced dead at the scene.

The drivers of the two other vehicles received minor injuries and were transported to Bundaberg Hospital. The Queensland forensic crash unit are now investigating the tragic incident.

It is a tragedy that has rocked Ms Roberts' family and the local community, with Mandy's mum and dad, Brenda and Ron, left struggling to come to terms with their loss. 

'They're not doing very well at the moment," she told NewsMail.

Ms Tasker said she asked Brenda how she wanted her daughter to be remembered.

'She said: 'She was just happy and she lit up the room when she walked in', she said.

Mandy's sister Sarah agreed and said she would remember her sister by how funny, beautiful and kind-hearted she was.

Ms Tasker said Ms Roberts's four eldest children would now live with their grandparents, while Cooper will live his father.
