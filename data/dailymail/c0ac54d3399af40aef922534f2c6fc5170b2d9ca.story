Oscar Pistorius was facing disciplinary action last night over his extraordinary outburst after  his defeat by a fellow blade runner.

In one of the biggest upsets of London 2012, Pistorius, who had not been beaten over 200m for seven years, was defeated in a thrilling finish by Brazilian Alan Oliveira.

Oliveira’s time was 21.25 seconds – slower than the world record Pistorius had set in the heats 24 hours earlier.

Bitter: Oscar Pistorius claimed opponents used longer 'blades' for unfair advantage

But after the race, the 25-year-old 
South African launched a tirade against his rival, accusing him of using
blades that gave him an unfair advantage.

Pistorius, the most famous 
Paralympian in the world, declared: ‘We are not running in a fair race 
here, absolutely ridiculous. The guy’s legs are unbelievably long.

‘Not taking away from Alan’s 
performance, he’s a great athlete, but these guys are a lot taller and 
you can’t compete (with the) stride length.’

Pistorius has twice previously 
complained about the rules on running blades to the International 
Paralympic Committee, (IPC) the governing body.

Officials said they 
would sit down with Pistorius in the next few days in a ‘non emotional 
environment’ to discuss his concerns and admitted the rules over the use
of blades would be reviewed as technology progresses.

Yesterday Pistorius, who could face a 
£5,000 fine for his outburst, attempted to calm the outcry by 
apologising for the timing of his comments, both in writing and 
personally to the 20-year-old.

He also applauded the Brazilian as the
pair received their medals in front of 80,000 spectators in the Olympic
Stadium, before giving each other a hug. But despite the mounting 
criticism, Pistorius did not change his sentiments.

‘That was Alan’s moment and I would 
like to put on record the respect I have for him,’ he said. ‘I want to 
apologise for the timing of my comments.’

He added: ‘I do believe that there is 
an issue here and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it with the IPC 
but I accept that raising these concerns immediately as I stepped off 
the track was wrong.

‘I am a proud Paralympian and believe in the fairness of sport. I am happy to work with the IPC who obviously share these aims.’

Ironically, Pistorius had faced 
similar opposition from those who claimed he should not be allowed to 
compete against able-bodied athletes as he did last month in the 
Olympics – because his blades could give him an advantage.

Experts are still divided on whether 
blades provide an advantage for runners and there are rules governing 
the length of the blades that athletes can wear in proportion to their 
height.

The IPC’s Craig Spence said that the 
length of the blades used by all eight athletes on Sunday night had been
measured and fully complied with the rules.

Mr Spence revealed that Pistorius had 
telephoned him personally to express concerns over the length of a rival
athlete’s blades six weeks ago although the athlete in question was not
Oliveira.

Handshake: Pistorius congratulated Alan Oliveira on his gold-winning performance, but claimed that athletes with longer blades had an unfair advantage

The restrictions on blade lengths are 
worked out by taking two measurements from an athlete’s body and then 
putting them into a formula that illustrates what that person’s height 
would be if they were not disabled.

What had so amazed Pistorius was that 
Oliveira was losing by eight metres in the home straight but was able to
run him down.

Stunned by the weight of criticism, Oliveira said he was 
sad because Pistorius was his ‘idol’ and he said he believed he had 
known his blades passed all the accepted tests.

‘He is not a bad loser,’ Oliveira 
insisted. ‘He is a great athlete. I am just sad with the interview where
he said my blades were too big.

'He was bothered by my time in the 
semi-finals and he wanted to get me with his polemic but it did not 
work. For me he is a really great idol and to hear that from a great 
idol is difficult.’
