Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be formally sentenced to death on June 24 at a hearing that will offer survivors of the 2013 attack and family members of the three people who died an opportunity to confront him.

The same federal jury that found Tsarnaev, 21, guilty of killing three people and injuring 264 in one of the highest-profile attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001, last month voted to sentence him to death.

On Thursday U.S. District Judge George O'Toole announced that he will formally hand down the sentence on June 24.

Prosecutors say at least 20 victims of the explosions have asked to speak at the sentencing hearing.

Tsarnaev, who did not testify in his own defense during the guilt or sentencing phases of his trial, will also have the right to speak, though he is under no obligation to do so.

Tsarnaev's trial evoked memories of the darkest days in recent memory in Boston as victims testified of being hurled through the air by the twin pressure-cooker bombs, struggling to save the lives of those who had lost limbs amid screams of pain and fears that additional explosions would follow.

Martin Richard, 8, 23-year-old Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu and 29-year-old restaurant manager Krystle Campbell were killed in the attack.

Tsarnaev was also convicted in the slaying of Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26. His family will also get an opportunity to speak at the sentencing.

Killed: Chinese student Lingzi Lu, 23, (left) also died in the bombing, while Somerville police officer Sean A Collier (right) was killed in a firefight with the Tsarnaevs days later

Defense attorneys, who are expected to appeal the death sentence and conviction, argued that Tsarnaev was the junior partner in a scheme hatched and driven forward by his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, who died four days after the bombing following a gunfight with police that ended when Dzhokhar inadvertently ran his brother over with a stolen car.

O'Toole has given Tsarnaev's lawyers until August 17 to file any post-trial motions along with all supporting material.

Just three of the 74 people sentenced to death in the United States for federal crimes since 1988 have been executed. The first was Timothy McVeigh, put to death in June 2001 for killing 168 people in his 1995 attack on the federal government office building in Oklahoma City.

No federal prisoners have been put to death since 2003.

Several court cases related to the bombing are due to draw to a close over the next month. Three college friends of Tsarnaev who were found guilty of impeding the investigation into the attack are due to be sentenced next week.

Tsarnaev may not be executed for his crimes for another 18 years, experts have claimed.

At 21, he is the youngest inmate on Death Row. But he could be 40 by the time he put to death by lethal injection.

This is due to the appeals process, which will likely take years for Tsarnaev's legal team to exhaust. Indeed, the bomber's defense attorney has already indicated she wants to take full advantage of it.

Judith Clarke has argued it was prejudicial to her client to hold the trial in Boston, Massachusetts, and that her team was given 'insufficient time' to prepare their arguments against the death penalty.

Legal expert Jim Fedalen said of Tsarnaev's time on Death Row: [He] may be the youngest inmate on death row at 21 but he could be pushing 40 by the time they march him to the death chamber.

‘We are looking at 18 years, possibly longer, before his appeals process is exhausted. By then, who even knows what the legal landscape on federal executions will look like?’

Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), added: 'Because there is a death verdict, there will be a thorough appeals process.

'If he had gotten a life sentence, this would be over with.' 

The jury's decision does not mean that Tsarnaev's death is imminent.

U.S. District Judge George O'Toole, who presided over the trial, will formally sentence Tsarnaev to death at a yet-to-be-scheduled hearing sometime in the next few months.

Defense attorneys are likely to appeal the decision, which will trigger more legal wrangling before any sentence can be delivered.

The death penalty remains highly controversial in Massachusetts, which has not put anyone to death in almost 70 years and abolished capital punishment for state crimes in 1984.

Tsarnaev was tried under federal law, which allows for lethal injection as a punishment.

Polls had shown that many Boston residents opposed executing Tsarnaev.

Opponents included family members of victims Martin Richard and Sean Collier.

Just three of the 74 people sentenced to death in the United States for federal crimes since 1988 have been executed. 

The same jury which today sentenced Tsarnaev to death found him guilty last month of all 30 federal charges brought against him - 17 of which were eligible for capital punishment.

They are listed below. Those highlighted in bold were those on which the jury delivered the death penalty:
