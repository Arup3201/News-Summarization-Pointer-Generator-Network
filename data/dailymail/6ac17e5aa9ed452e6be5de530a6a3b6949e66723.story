Wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has been pictured leaving hospital with her new baby daughter wearing a vest emblazoned with the slogan: 'The best things in life are free'.

The mother-of-three, who shot to notoriety when she had a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, sold tickets to the birth of her child, and threatened to abort her unborn child to go on a reality TV programme, gave birth last night.

Josie smiled and waved at photographers as she left St James's Hospital in Leeds, West Yorkshire, carrying her daughter, who was covered with a pink blanket, to a waiting taxi.

This morning she posted a black-and-white photograph of her as yet unnamed baby's fingers clutching hers on her Twitter account, accompanied by three kisses, and tweeted throughout this morning in response to a number of well wishers.

But the new mother - who already has two sons - was also pelted with online abuse after news of the birth broke.

The mother-of-three, who shot to notoriety when she had a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, was taken to hospital on Sunday

The mother has previously claimed to have sold tickets to the birth of her child, and openly smoked during pregnancy

After tweeting the picture, a number of users hurled abuse at her.

It comes after Josie said she would set up a trust fund to pay for her unborn daughter's boob job - with money she had set aside to reimburse the NHS for her own surgery.

But her most widely-reported outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Big Brother.

A source close to the 24-year-old told The Sun she was thinking about naming the girl after Katie Price's daughter Bunny.

It's a girl! Josie Cunningham, pictured in hospital with her agent Rob Cooper, gave birth to her child last night

Her agent Rob Cooper posted a cheery photo on Twitter yesterday from her bed on a labour ward, saying: 'Not long till baby's here.......#Eeeeeek!'

The birth came after Josie revealed she had been duped into thinking the child's father was Hull City captain Curtis Davies.

Despite friends warning her the man might not be Hull's £2.2million central defender, she fell for the trick even after searching for pictures of the real footballer on Google.

Josie said the father, who she began sleeping with after meeting him at a Leicester hotel in April last year, was 'IDENTICAL to the real Curtis - but turns out he is just a lookalike.'

Girl power: The 24-year-old said this month she would set up a trust fund for her own daughter's boob job

Posting four pages about the situation on Twitter, she wrote: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer.

'I feel physically fooled by him and had sex with someone who claimed to be someone he wasn't.

'I let a conman put his hands on me, kiss me with his lips and fill my head with lies.'

She added: 'We wasn't in a full blown relationship, so I didn't see him too much, that's how he managed to keep the lie going. I know I'm not that clever.' 

Mr Davies, 29, who signed for the club last year, lives with his girlfriend Laura Dearn, 25.

There is no suggestion he has been involved with Josie, and Hull City declined to comment.

Mr Davies tweeted that he would not be responding to the 'non-story', and added that he was 'disappointed'.

He said: 'My life goes on as normal'

The episode is the latest in  an ongoing series of unusual dramas since Josie revealed she was pregnant.

Fooled: The mother-of-three, who met the baby's father last year, said on Twitter that she felt 'physically sick'

She reassured followers she had Googled Curtis Davies, but was still tricked into believing the man was him

Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.

Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job.

Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery.

But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. 

The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy.

She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'.

Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child.

Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.
