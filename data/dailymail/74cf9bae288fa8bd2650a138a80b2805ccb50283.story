A farmer was stunned to find that a portaloo which had been abandoned at the bottom of her field was transformed overnight into a Doctor Who Tardis.

Louise Possegger, 52, has no idea who enacted the transformation, which saw the convenience mocked up to resemble an old-fashioned police box.

The anonymous pranksters added fake windows and painted the sides the distinctive police blue – even adding a sign which reads 'police box – public call'.

Mystery: Louise Possegger, pictured, found that a portaloo dumped in her farm had transformed into a Tardis

The toilet, now nicknamed ‘Doctor Loo’ appeared in Mrs Possegger’s farm in Lewes, East Sussex, in July.

It had been dumped there after a Mumford and Sons concert in Lewes on 21-22 July, but had lain undisturbed until being given a sci-fi makeover last week.

Mrs Possegger said: ‘It started when a road traffic management company came down from Devon to control the cars at the Mumford concert.

‘They never took it back and I have asked
them three times. Now, someone has randomly turned it into a Doctor Who
phone box and we have no idea who.’

Farm worker Andreas Long said: 'I pass it every day on my day to work and earlier this week it had been completely decorated. I don't know why but it is funny.

'It is on the farm owner’s land but not a field we use. As far as I know no one is still using it is a toilet.'
