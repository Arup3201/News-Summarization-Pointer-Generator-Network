A woman captured by surveillance cameras trying to jump to her death from an overpass in China was pulled back to safety by a number of bystanders

The woman, who is dressed in black tights and a pink puffer jacket casually walks up to the railing and quickly surveys what is underneath before climbing up onto the ledge with some degree of difficulty.

But the act catches the attention of another woman, who is holding a white umbrella, who runs over to help.

Desperate: Surveillance footage shows a Chinese woman climbing onto the railing to try and commit suicide while no one is around

Help: A woman rushes to help after spotting the woman attempting to jump, but can't pull her to safety because she is still holding her umbrella

The woman planning to jump turns around and catches a glimpse of the bystander upon hearing her running over and quickly tries to get over the ledge.

But the woman hesitates as her legs begin to drop, throwing her arms around a concrete pillar and holding on to stay alive.

The Good Samaritan is able to extend one of her arms to assist, but is unable to pull the woman to safety because she is still holding her umbrella.

A man walking past 50 metres away notices what is happening and sprints over to lend a hand, but the two of them are unable to pull the slight woman, who appears to be middle-aged, back over the railing.

Another three people run in to assist – two of them also refusing to drop their umbrellas as they reach in to lend some muscle.

A woman walking past stops to see what is going on, before she appears to scream frantically and plead for more people to run in and offer assistance.

Rescue: Several more people rush in to help a woman to safety while still holding their umbrellas

Success: The team of 16 manage to pull the Chinese woman to safety after she was dangling dangerously over the edge for more than one minute

The woman has been dangling over the edge for 30 seconds before someone in the crowd throws away the umbrellas.

More people then rush in to help, with a total of 16 strangers now working to pull the small woman back up onto the road – a feat they achieve after 66 frightening seconds.

The video is a refreshing act of kindness from the group of rescuers, most of whom grew up in an era where self-preservation was ranked as more important than assisting others.

It follows another kind-hearted gesture in August last year, where Chinese woman Wang Lan took an elderly woman to hospital after spotting her writhing on the ground in pain.

The elderly woman then claimed Ms Wang, who also helped to cover 200 yuan in medical expenses, was the person responsible for her injury and demanded to be compensated 40,000 yuan in damages.

Ms Wang was taken to court but her name was cleared after surveillance footage revealed she had not caused the injury to the elderly woman.
