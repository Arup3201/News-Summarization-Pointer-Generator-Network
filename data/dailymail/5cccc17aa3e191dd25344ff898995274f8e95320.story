A single mother working as a waitress in Virginia got the Christmas gift of a lifetime on Thursday when a customer tipped her $1,200 on a $128 tab.

Server Megan Asadi at The Virginia Kitchen in Herndon, Virginia received a 946 per cent cash tip from kind diners who wished to remain anonymous.

The Good Samaritans who left the generous tip have a website called tipbombs.com and they leave a momentous tip to an unsuspecting server annually and post the story on their site.

Big tip: Customers who call themselves 'tip bombers' tipped Megan Asadi $1,200 on a $128 tab on Thursday

 Asadi was going to take Thursday off but luckily she didn't and was able to walk out $1,200 richer.

'I wanted to get off today, but....' she told FOX laughing in disbelief about her good fortune.

 The single mother of two teenagers moved from Iran to America five years ago. She says she plans on spending her money on her daughters for holiday gifts.

'I'm going to surprise them,' she told Fox.

'Take them to the mall and tell them, "Buy everything you want."'

This isn't the first time the tip bombers have surprised a lucky server. Last year they left a waiter with just a bit more than $1,400.

Local spot: Server Megan Asadi at The Virginia Kitchen in Herndon, Virginia is a single mom with two teenage daughters who she plans to take shopping with her big tip 

Surprise: The anonymous tip bombers gave $1,400 to a waiter last year and give a surprise tip annually
