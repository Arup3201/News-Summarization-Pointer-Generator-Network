A former Tory has been arrested after allegedly biting the founder of Fathers 4 Justice and his landlord while trying to serve him with legal papers.

Adrian Yalland, 44, was held on suspicion of assault after apparently biting Matt O'Connor, 46, and his landlord in Stockbridge, Hampshire.

Mr Yalland claims he was trying to serve the Fathers 4 Justice campaign director with a libel claim when the incident happened.

Row: Adrian Yalland claimed that he was trying to serve Matt O'Connor with legal papers when they became involved in a confrontation. Mr O'Connor said he had called the police and Mr Yalland is shown as he replied "Good, good!".

The Westminster lobbyist is the former 
executive vice-president of political PR company Chelgate and the 
director of pro-life campaign group Right To Know.

Mr O'Connor, who lives with his wife Nadine and four children, claimed that the former prospective Conservative candidate forced the electric gates outside his home when he went to deliver the legal papers.

Once Mr Yalland had left the property he attempted to take a photograph of it as proof that he had served his legal papers.

He then became involved in an apparent scrap with Mr O'Connor and his landlord.

Mr O'Connor claimed that he was 'punched' by the former Tory before both he and the landlord were bitten.

Mr Yalland said the two men tried to snatch his mobile phone and said he only reacted proportionately in self-defence after being 'punched' and 'pinned down'. 

He also claims Mr O'Connor was constantly advancing towards him throughout the encounter.

This is the injury Mr Yalland admitted causing Mr O'Connor's landlord in self-defense. Mr Yalland was not subsequently charged.

Police arrived at the scene and arrested the 44-year-old who is understood to have been in a long-running dispute with Mr O'Connor.

Officers are examining video footage of the incident recorded by the O'Connors.

Mrs O’Connor said: 'He took pictures of our home and eight year-old son and tried to speak to him before he was removed from the premises.

'At this point the police were called.

Mr Yalland said 'there are two sides to every story - especially this one'. He claimed that the two men had attempted to steal his mobile phone.

The incident unfolded in the small town of Stockbridge in Hampshire

In a statement issued to the media, he added: 'After having been pushed to the floor, I was punched in the back of the head by a second individual, and had a hand forced over my face, whilst I believe a second attempt was made to steal my phone.

'Whilst pinned down, and fearing further attack, I acted proportionately, in self defence, and only to allow me to escape – which I did immediately. The only person punched was me.

'I am pleased a witness came forward to confirm my version of events, and I therefore look forward to the police concluding their investigations with interest.'

A spokesman for Hampshire Police confirmed that a 44-year-old man was arrested.

'Police were called at 4.10pm on Thursday February 20 following a report of a dispute outside an address in Stockbridge,' he said.

'A 56-year-old man and a 46-year-old man both from Stockbridge suffered minor injuries.

'A 44-year-old man from Marchwood was arrested on suspicion of assault. He has been bailed pending further enquiries until March 27.'
