What may have seemed like a funny prank to a group Australian guys on holiday in Canada - could get the larrikins in hot water with authorities.

After two days of partying, three of the lads decided to pull a stunt on a mate who had passed out on the sofa at the two-storey house they were staying in while on their overseas jaunt.

The video footage of the unconscious man being thrown from a balcony has sparked so much outrage over the wreckless antic that the footage has been taken down from Facebook and YouTube.

After two days of partying, three of the lads decided to pull a stunt on a mate who had passed out on the sofa at the two-storey house they were staying in while on their Canadian break

After getting him out on the balcony, the guys have a bit of trouble lifting his limp body over the railing with one saying 'I can't lift his leg though its f*****g heavy'

The Live Leak website reports that rumours are circulating that the police are investigating the contentious gag.  

'Our mate Snowy passed out half naked on the couch after a 2 day bender,' LiveLeak reported a friend as saying. 

'He needed a wake up, so we threw him off the second story balcony of our house into the snow.'

The footage shows the camera man coaxing some of the guys to join in on the stunt by gesturing with has hand before saying to one of them: 'come give us a hand son.' 

One bloke decides to follow them saying 'that's such a good idea' as they make their way over to the couch where their oblivious mate, dressed only in shorts, is passed out sitting upright.

One guy grabs both of his legs while two others grab an arm each and start to drag him from the lounge room to the balcony door as the cameraman follows them while incessantly giggles.

But they manage to pull him up when one of the guys says 'three, two, go' before throwing from the two -story height into the snow

The guy doesn't move at first but then slowly pulls himself up onto his elbows and rolls a little bit down the hill much to the delight of his mates watching from above
