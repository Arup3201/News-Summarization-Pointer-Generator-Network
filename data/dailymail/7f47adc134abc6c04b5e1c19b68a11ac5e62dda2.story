The furious mother of a four-year-old boy shot in the face has hit out after the teenage gunman was slapped with a fine instead of a prison sentence.

Hayley Horton said she had been left 'angry, disappointed and upset' at the sentence after the 17-year-old admitted shooting her son Zak Horton as he was walking home from school.

The mother-of-three said: 'He should have had a custodial sentence. He shot a four-year-old boy'.

'Disappointed': Jack and Hayley Horton with their son Zak who's scar is clearly visible on his chin after being shot with an airgun in the chin while he was walking home from school in June

She added: 'I’m angry, disappointed and upset - it’s no punishment. It’s sending out the message that you can do something like this and get away with it.'

The boy, who cannot be named, was fined £500 and referred to a youth offending team.

Upset: Zak's mother Hayley said her son is still very scared about what happened and can't be on his own

Zak was running along an alleyway with twin brother Charlie when he was hit on the chin by a potentially deadly air gun pellet.

He had been on his way home from 
Studley’s Community Infants School in Warwickshire on Tuesday, June 19, 
when he was shot in front of his mother.

It happened at around 3.25pm, less than 100 metres from Zak’s school.

He
 was rushed to Redditch’s Alexandra Hospital where medics operated to 
remove the pellet, but he has been left with a half-inch scar.

Hayley
 and father Jack, a 27-year-old Land Rover engineer in Solihull’s Lode 
Lane factory, maintained a bedside vigil while their boy was sedated.

Meanwhile,
 Warwickshire Police had arrested the culprit and bailed him until 
earlier this month, when he was charged with assault causing actual 
bodily harm - a section 47 assault.

The Studley teenager appeared at Leamington and Rugby Youth Court in Leamington, where he pleaded guilty to the charge.

He
 was told to pay £85 costs and £500 compensation to Zak on top of six 
months with a youth offending team which will monitor his progress and 
try to stop him committing more crimes.

'We’ve not told Zak about it. He would be frightened to know this ‘naughty boy’ isn’t with the police,' added Ms Horton, 28.

'He’s still very scared about what happened and can’t be on his own.

Hospital: Since he recovered Zak (pictured in hospital) is still very scared and doesn't like being on his own

Worrying: Jack and Hayley kept a bedside vigil while their son Zak was sedated. The 17-year-old culprit was charged with assault causing actual bodily harm but has been spared a jail sentence

'And so far we’ve avoided the area he got shot, but we’ll have to go there when the new school term starts.

'But what’s made it worse is that we weren’t allowed to go to court, so we don’t know what this teenager looks like.

'Whenever I see a teenage boy in the street now I think: ‘Was that him?’ If I knew what he looked like then I could make sure we avoided him.'

The court ordered the teenager's airgun be destroyed.
