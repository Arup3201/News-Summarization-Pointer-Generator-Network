Coronation Street star Barbara Knox's daughter has been banned from the roads for two years after she was arrested for drink driving

The daughter of Coronation Street actress Barbara Knox - who plays Rita Tanner - has been banned from the roads for two years after she was arrested for drink driving.

Maxine Ashcroft, 56, was stopped by police while driving home a relative - believed to be Ms Knox - from a family gathering in Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

The veteran ITV star, 80, later arrived at the police station and was arrested herself on suspicion of drink driving.

She has been bailed pending further inquiries.

Ashcroft was arrested after a member of the public following the Jaguar reported to police they thought the driver was under the influence of alcohol, Macclesfield magistrates heard.

Shortly after, police stopped Ashcroft in Knutsford, Cheshire on the evening of March 10.

She was said to have smelt of 'intoxicants' and a roadside test was returned positive.

The defendant was taken to Middlewich police station and gave a breathalyser reading of 97 microgrammes (mg) of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath - three times the legal limit of 35mg.

Today Ashcroft, of Kencot, Lechlade, Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty to drink driving.

Representing her, Nick 'Mr Loophole' Freeman, told the court: 'She is thoroughly contrite and ashamed.

'She has let herself down and her family down. She accepts full responsibility for her actions. She is the author of her own misfortune.

'She made a terrible error of judgment which is going to have terrible consequences for her. This was a classic case of alcohol anaesthatising good sense.'

Mr Freeman appealed to the magistrates to
 lessen the length of the ban due to the circumstances of his client. 
The divorcee had recently moved from Cheshire to a rural location where 
the nearest shop was six miles away.

Mr Freeman said: 'I don't like to use the word recluse but literally her driving licence is her lifeblood.

'She does not have anyone to drive for her.

'She has no friends there. She literally would not have a life.'

The court heard she had 'close family ties' with her parents who she saw on a regular basis who 'she cares for as a daughter and is trying to look after them as much as possible'.

Sentencing her, chairman of the bench Graham Hall told her: 'Miss Ashcroft, I do not think you need me to tell you how serious this is and how foolish and dangerous this act was.'

He said the bench had considered a community sentence to go alongside the ban but imposed a fine instead after they took into account her remorse, her personal circumstances and her good character.

Ashcroft was fined £960 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a victim surcharge of £96. Knox was not present at court.
