A married couple have been found dead in their home after a husband allegedly murdered his wife who had recently returned home from hospital having suffered a stroke.

The bodies of Douglas Morton, 61, and his 73-year-old wife Carol French were found at their terrace house in Wandsworth, south-west London, in an apparent murder-suicide

Scotland Yard said officers were called to the house on Stormont Road near Clapham Common after concerns were raised for the welfare of the occupants.

When they got in, they found the body of a woman in a first-floor bedroom and the body of a man in a first-floor bathroom.

Post-mortem examinations are due to take place, but the force said Mrs French's death is being treated as suspicious, while that of Mr Morton is being treated as non-suspicious.

A murder investigation has been launched by detectives from the Homicide and Major Crime Command but officers are not looking for anyone else.

Today neighbours on the leafy street said they were ‘shocked’ at the death of the ‘lovely couple’.

One, who declined to be named, said: ‘She had a stroke, she had been in hospital for it and had got out and been in rehab. They are both retired, they seemed like a nice, normal couple.

'They were a lovely couple. I didn't notice any arguments or anything, they seemed very nice'

‘He was nice, he used to help his neighbours out and dropped a newspaper around to his next door neighbour's house. He wasn't in bad health, he seemed fine. Obviously we are all really shocked, it is just so sad. We hadn't noticed them rowing.’

Another neighbour, who also did not wish to be identified, said: ‘They were a lovely couple. I didn't notice any arguments or anything, they seemed very nice.

‘I think they were retired, I haven't noticed any family go and visit them, I don't think they had any family. I know she had recently got out of hospital. It is such a shock, very sad. They seemed lovely.’
