When it came down to choosing one of the best names in football, Max Power’s parents had two choices. Their son was to be named either after his mother or the family’s pet labrador.

‘Thankfully, the labrador won,’ says Power. ‘My mum’s name is Maxine, so I’m glad I didn’t get that.’

There is more to the Tranmere Rovers midfielder than just his name but it has certainly helped to get him noticed.

‘The worst was thinking that I’d been named after Homer’s alter ego character in The Simpsons,’ he says, ‘but when I looked it up I was relieved to see that episode didn’t come out until I was six.

‘I got asked to do a piece for the Max Power car magazine once, although I did keep my clothes on for the pictures,’ he jokes. ‘..and I get a double-take from lads when I introduce myself from time to time but I’ve got used to it. I’ve even called my baby son Max Jr.’

Fortunately, Power has a football talent that is also attracting attention. The 21-year-old is expected to become the latest product of Tranmere’s academy to step up into the big time with even this weekend’s FA Cup opponents Swansea City among his admirers.

Celtic, Rangers, Burnley and Derby have also charted his progress this season; one that has brought nine goals amid Tranmere’s struggle to escape the clutches of a second successive relegation, this time from League Two.

As a local boy, it has been a difficult fall for Power to endure.

‘Getting relegated last season was the worst experience of my career,’ says Power. ‘We needed to beat Bradford to have a chance but we had a man sent off and the game fell away from us. I was taken off and I remember the Bradford fans singing ‘’Going down, going down’’ as other results filtered through. I was crying on the bench.

‘I was sick for weeks afterwards, embarrassed to go out. It was very hard to take.

‘My dad and a lot of my friends are big Tranmere fans and they tried to lift me but the only time you get it out of your system is when you get back playing again.’

The plan was to bounce back quickly but new manager Rob Edwards was sacked after just two wins in 14 games and, with Tranmere staring the Conference in the face, Micky Adams was brought in to start the salvage operation.

‘I think I’ve had six managers since I turned professional,’ says Power. ‘John Barnes, Les Parry, who gave me my debut, Ronnie Moore, John McMahon as caretaker, Rob and now the boss. Each of them are different characters. Micky Adams came with a reputation for being strict and he is but it works for me. He’s helped me a lot and I’m playing with confidence now. Every time I go on the pitch I believe I’m going to score.’

Power has scored two goals already in this season’s FA Cup, scoring the winner in the first round against Bristol Rovers and deciding the second round replay against Oxford United. He is quick to point out his first ever Tranmere goal was also in the FA Cup against Braintree. It seems ominous for Swansea.

‘I hope so,’ says Power. ‘I’ve always had an affection for the FA Cup. My earliest memory was watching Liverpool beat Tranmere 4-2 at Prenton Park in 2001 with my mum, who’s a big Liverpool fan, and I saw "the Gerrard Final" when Steven was out on his feet but inspired Liverpool to beat West Ham at Cardiff. It’s always exciting, it’s a great competition especially for clubs in our position.

‘We’re under no illusions it will be a tough game. There are Premier League sides that struggle to get the ball off Swansea so we’ll do well to get a result but history shows anything is possible.’

An eye-catching performance could help propel Power to the level he is destined for. Educated at Wirral Grammar School, where former Prime Minister Harold Wilson attended, Power is ambitious but remains grounded. You would expect little else from a young man who turned down the chance to join Liverpool at the age of eight to stay with Tranmere.

‘Like everyone I’d like to play at the best level but Tranmere have always looked after me,’ he says. ‘Steve Heighway gave me the chance to stay with Liverpool when I was young but I enjoyed myself more at Tranmere. I’ve never regretted it.

‘You see players who stay with big clubs chasing a dream but the reality is it is often better to step back or sideways to sustain a career.

‘Playing at this level is hard but it’s a great experience. We’ve just played five games in 13 days. I played against Cambridge the other night and it was like swimming in treacle, my legs felt that heavy.

‘We had Kristoffer Peterson from Liverpool on loan here and he couldn’t believe how hard it was. Playing for U21 development teams, players have ability but the games are not as competitive. You could leave a club like Liverpool after years and have no experience of playing league football. At Tranmere I’ve played nearly 100 games at 21, that can only stand me in good stead.’

For now, the Power is with Tranmere.
