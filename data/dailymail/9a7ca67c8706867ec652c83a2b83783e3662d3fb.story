A man has told how a botched operation to remove his 'moobs' caused him to lose his nipple and his job.

Mark Jones, 39, had been bullied since childhood because of the large collection of fat in his chest which resembled breasts.

The common condition, also known as gynaecomastia, affects around 15 per cent of adult men in the UK.

Mark Jones, 39, was left with only one nipple and no job after botched surgery to remove his 'moobs'

Mr Jones, from Bebington, Wirral, spent £7,500 having a procedure to remove the excess tissue, otherwise known as a male breast reduction, in May 2011.

Sadly, the operation went wrong and after losing his nipple and his job Mr Jones says he is left ‘feeling like a freak’.

He said: ‘I was always active growing up but for some reason fat collected in that area.

‘No matter how much exercise I did the area wouldn’t firm up and the fat on my chest wouldn’t go away.’

Like many men affected by “man boobs”, Mr Jones was subjected to a lifetime of bullying and name calling, which started at school but stretched into the workplace.

He said: ‘As a child the kids I played football with used to chant, “get your boobs out for the lads” in the changing room.

Mr Jones was bullied for years - at school and then at work - because of his "man boobs". As a result, he had very low self-esteem and went through his teens and 20s without ever being in a relationship

Mr Jones, from the Wirral, spent £7,500 on surgery to have the excess fat on his chest removed, but it went wrong and he was left with only one nipple (pictured)

‘The teasing carried on at school, they would make jokes about me needing a bra. There was just no let up and I became obsessed with trying to cover my chest at all times.

‘I wouldn’t wear t-shirts, preferring to cover up in baggy clothes. Even in summer I would layer on hoodies and jumpers so people couldn’t see my breasts.’

Mr Jones was left with cripplingly low self-esteem and, despite being a semi-professional footballer, he found it impossible to speak to girls.

He said: ‘I thought if I tried to chat a girl up she would just laugh, or, take the mickey out of me. So, I just didn’t try, I thought it was safer to be on my own so never had a relationship.’

Mr Jones' nipple had to be removed after the operation as its blood supply was lost so it turned black. He had more surgery as medics attempted to build him a new one but these procedures were unsuccessful

Sadly, this meant Mr Jones spent most of his 20s watching his friends date from the side lines.

He said: ‘Mates would talk about girls they had met, the physical side of their relationships and girlfriends they had, all I could do was listen.

‘I was envious but I knew that no girl would want to see what it looked like under my top. I felt like I was less of a man.’

Mr Jones spent his spare time avoiding any situation that would mean he had to take his top off.

He said: “Holidays, trips to the seaside, swimming pools, sunbathing, I went to extreme lengths to avoid them.’

Mr Jones had to have so much time off work for surgery he lost his job and unemployment left him depressed

After injuring his arm playing football in 2003, Mr Jones stopped exercising and put on weight, only making his issue worse.

He said: ‘My weight reached 19.5st and the extra fat collected around my chest making them look even more like breasts.

‘I knew I had to do something or I would end up being alone for the rest of my life.’

Mr Jones lost weight in 2008 by going on a TV programme called ‘Diet On The Dancefloor’, where contestants competed to lose the most weight.

Dropping 2.5st in eight weeks Mr Jones had a boost to his confidence that pushed him to try and get rid of the issue that had plagued his life.

Mr Jones said: 'I wouldn't wear t-shirts, preferring to cover up in baggy clothes. Even in summer I would layer on hoodies and jumpers so people couldn't see my breasts'

He said: ‘I had some savings set aside and after reading about a man who had a breast reduction I decided to look into it myself.

‘I did my research, found a practice in London and paid the £7,500 fee. It was a lot of money but I knew it was going to change my life.’

Sadly, Mr Jones was right, the operation did change his life, but not for the better.

He said: ‘I woke with heavy bruising and a loss of blood flow to one breast. I thought it was normal and the surgeon said the operation had been a success.’

Gynaecomastia is a common condition which causes men's breasts to swell.

It can appear as a small amount of extra tissue, or, as prominent breasts.

It’s also referred to as ‘man boobs’ and can be caused by a hormone imbalance where the male affected produces too much oestrogen.

Losing weight or exercise will not affect the condition as it’s not caused by being overweight.

Tthe main treatment is surgery to remove the excess breast tissue.

But as Mr Jones lay in bed, imaging the new life he would have, the bruising worsened.

He said: ‘They changed the dressing one day and one of my nipples had gone black, there was no blood going to it all.

‘The surgeon explained they had to remove it but would be able to construct another nipple using a skin graft.’

For Mr Jones, who thought the operation would mean meeting a woman and finally losing his insecurities, it was a bitter blow.

‘I had been so excited about having the operation I didn’t think about what could have gone wrong. I just assumed it would be straightforward and I would have the body I had always dreamed of.’

Once he had recovered from the operation, Mr Jones returned for a skin graft where skin was taken from his leg to make a new nipple.

He said: ‘They left the new nipple to heal but when I went in to have the dressing removed the nipple came off with it, it hadn’t attached properly to my skin.

‘I looked down and the pink circular lump of fat and felt sick, once again I felt like a complete freak.’

Doctors quickly arranged to do the process again, which meant two more operations but sadly for Mr Jones, neither worked and he was left with no nipple.

Mr Jones (pictured after his original nipple was removed, but before the failed reconstruction surgery) has now found a new job and a partner, Dawn, but he still hopes to find a way of improving the look of his chest

He said: ‘To make matters worse, with all the time off I had my work grew impatient and had to let me go.

‘The hospital gave me a prosthetic nipple to wear underneath clothes, so it didn’t look odd.

‘It felt stupid having to walk around with something stuck to my chest just to make me look like a normal man.

‘While a lot of the fatty tissue had been removed my pecs still looked saggy.’

To make matters worse, Mr Jones started to feel depressed about his lack of work too.

Mr Jones (pictured after his failed reconstruction surgery) said: 'I had been so excited about having the operation I didn't think about what could have gone wrong. I just assumed it would be straightforward and I would have the body I had always dreamed of'

He said: ‘My confidence hit rock bottom, while I had always had issues about my body I was a grafter, I had always had my job to take my mind off things.

‘With no work on top of everything else I didn’t feel like a real man, I felt useless.’

But thankfully for Mr Jones, amongst all the bad luck, one thing had gone his way.

He said: ‘I met Dawn, through a friend and we became a couple, she’s been my rock through everything.

‘It’s ironic that I had the operation so I could have a relationship one day but I’ve met Dawn despite it all going wrong.

‘It just seems unfair that after spending all that money, I’m still not happy with the way I look.

‘My chest looks saggy and I still wouldn’t take my top off in front of a stranger. Swimming or sunbathing in public is out of the question.’

Yet, despite everything he has been through, Mr Jones still stands by his decision to have the surgery.

He said: ‘Like most people who have cosmetic surgery, I felt l had no other choice but to go under the knife, things had got that bad.

Mr Jones said: 'My chest looks better than it used to and, although I've lost a nipple, I've found happiness'

‘My moobs had ruined my teen and adult years so I would have done anything to be rid of them. Sadly, it didn’t work out for me.’

After a long period of difficulty Mr Jones has also found a new job as a sales manager and is trying to move forward with his life.

He said: ‘My chest looks better than it used to and although I’ve lost a nipple I’ve found happiness with Dawn.

‘I still hope something might be able to be done in the future to improve the way I look.’
