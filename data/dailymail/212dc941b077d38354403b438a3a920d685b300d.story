Earlier this month she was sunning herself with Michelle Rodriguez, yesterday she was indulging in some retail therapy with Taylor Swift and today she's smooching her own reflection as the star of YSL's new beauty campaign; just your average April in the crazy world of Cara Delevingne.

The 21-year-old model and muse has been unveiled as the face of YSL's latest lip innovation, Rouge Pur Couture Vernis à Lèvres, and stars in a sultry new short film to celebrate.

Cara, who looks glamorous in an all-black outfit, can been seen applying the shiny red lipgloss in the mirror before a male version of herself steps out and attempts to seduce her.

In the 'From Lips to Love' mini movie, Cara indulges in a flirty exchange with the male version of herself before leaning into the mirror, saying 'anything could happen', and smooching her reflection.

Last week, Cara was seen seductively puckering up with workmate Ondria Hardin as part of another glamourous YSL beauty campaign.

The pair look super slick, with simple, combed back loose hair and bold YSL colours adorning both their eyes and lips.

The sizzling images were released as part of the Baby Doll Kiss and Blush campaign and 
are a follow-up to the recent Baby Doll Mascara and Touche Eclat line, 
where Cara posed alongside model Jourdan Dunn.

Her work for YSL is just a fraction of what's been keeping Cara and her famous eyebrows busy of late.

As
 well as starring in an array of campaigns including Burberry, Chanel, 
DKNY and walking for designers Karl Lagerfeld and Giles Deacon at 
Fashion Week, Britain's busiest model is also a prolific poster on 
Instagram - sharing images of her day to day life.

While she was recently holidaying in Mexico with girlfriend Michelle, busy work schedules meant that they're apart from each 
other again, even though they are both in the US.

Cara was spotted talking mournfully into her phone in West Hollywood after lunching with friends today.

It's likely Cara will join the rest of the Britpack at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio this weekend.

Cara’s
sister Poppy is hosting a pool party at Superdry’s Coachella residence 
on Saturday - which the two are thought to be on the guest list for.
