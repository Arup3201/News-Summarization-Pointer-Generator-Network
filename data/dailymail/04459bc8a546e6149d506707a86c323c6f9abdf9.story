William Hague has said there was 'not a remote possibility' of UN-backed military action against Syria despite the violence that has left up to 140 protesters dead.

President Bashar al-Assad’s tanks yesterday battered the city of Hama  as the country’s government waged ‘full armed warfare’ on its own people to crush demonstrations.

The attacks came in response to protests that have raged for several months against his rule, pleading for political reform.

But the Foreign Secretary ruled out confronting the regime, saying there was no international appetite for military action.

Forces began their brutal co-ordinated assault on Hama at dawn yesterday, having besieged it for the past four weeks.

Security forces backed by tanks and 
snipers yesterday launched a ferocious assault on defiant cities and 
towns, leaving scores dead.

Utilities were cut off and main exit routes were closed before the troops moved in.

Reports said forces were 
firing in unarmed residential districts where inhabitants put up 
makeshift roadblocks to stop them.

The government troops then encountered armed resistance from rebel militias.

Estimates of the death toll, which were impossible to verify, ranged from around 75 people to nearly 140 on a day when the attacks began before dawn.

Medical staff said hospitals were 
overrun by the wounded, suggesting the death toll could rise sharply, witnesses said. Bodies lay uncollected in the streets last night
after the tanks pulled out, having failed to take control of the city 
centre.

The shelling prompted condemnation around the world.

US President Barack Obama called the reports "horrifying" and said Assad was "completely incapable and unwilling" to respond to the legitimate grievances of the Syrian people.

But Mr Hague has said he simply wants 'additional sanctions' to ratchet up the pressure on President Assad's regime.

'We want to see stronger international pressure all round,' said Mr Hague. 'To be effective that can't just be 
pressure from Western nations - that includes from Arab nations, it 
includes from Turkey, which has been very active in trying to persuade 
President Assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling 
actions.'

He added: 'I would also like to see a
United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn this violence, to
call for the release of political prisoners and call for legitimate 
grievances to be responded to.'

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Mr Hague admitted that 
agreeing a resolution would be 'quite difficult', saying: 'There are 
nations on the Security Council opposed to any resolution - or they have
certainly been in recent weeks. We will revisit this in the coming hours and days.'

Mr Hague said UN-backed military 
action against Syria was 'not a remote possibility', describing the 
situation as different from Libya when the UN passed a resolution 
endorsing armed intervention.

'It is a very frustrating situation. The levers we have are very limiting,' he added.

Italian Foreign Minister Franco 
Frattini has appealed to the Syrian government 'to immediately cease the
violence against civilians,' calling it 'a horrible act of violent 
repression against protesters who have been demonstrating for days in a 
peaceful manner'.

UN 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for an end to the violence and 
reminded Syrian authorities that 'they are accountable under 
international human rights law for all acts of violence perpetrated by 
them against the civilian population'.

President Assad’s father, President 
Hafez al-Assad, sent in troops to Hama to smash an Islamist-led uprising
in 1982, killing up to 30,000 Syrians. The operation was led by the president's brother, Rifaat.

Current
President Bashar Assad has turned to his own brother, Maher, who 
commands the army's elite Fourth Division, to deal with the unrest.

Activists said killings and attacks 
took place in other parts of Syria yesterday, although the uprising has 
yet to engulf the two main cities of Damascus and Aleppo.

A resident said bodies were lying uncollected in the streets and so the death toll would rise.

Army snipers had climbed onto the roofs of the state-owned electricity company and the main prison, he said.

It
has been reported that electricity and water supplies had been cut in a
tactic regularly used by the army when storming towns to crush 
demonstrations.

Residents
of northern Hama told Reuters that tank shells were falling at the rate
of four a minute there. They also confirmed deaths in the area.

In southern Syria, rights campaigners 
said security forces killed three civilians when they stormed houses in 
the town of al-Hirak, 20 miles northeast of the city of Deraa.

The 
government has blamed armed terrorist gangs for most killings during the
revolt but reports suggest the protests have been largely peaceful, 
with only isolated cases of people arming themselves against the 
military assault.

Most foreign media have been banned from the area, making it difficult to verify reports of the fighting.

A Western diplomat who said he saw several tanks enter the suburb said: 'The regime thinks it can scare people before Ramadan and make them stay home.

'But especially the people of Hama have shown themselves to be resilient,' he said, referring to the Muslim holy month, which starts in Syria today.

An estimated 1,600 civilians 
have died in the crackdown on the largely peaceful protests against 
President Bashar Assad's regime since the uprising began more than four 
months ago.

Assad is trying to end an uprising against
his 11-year rule that broke out in March, inspired by the Arab Spring
revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and which has spread across the
country.

Most of the dead were killed in shootings by security forces on anti-government rallies.

In early June, security forces shot 
dead 65 people there, and since then it has fallen out of government 
control, with protesters holding the streets and government forces 
ringing the city and mounting overnight raids.

One person is disappearing in Syria every hour, according to online campaign group Avaaz.org.

The website states that 3,000 people have been
arrested by regime forces and 'disappeared' into secret jails since the
start of the uprising against President Bashar Assad more than four 
months ago.

More than 1,600 people have been reported killed, most of them unarmed protesters.

Although the uprising began in mid-March with calls for reform, the steadily climbing death toll and slow pace of reform has enraged the protest movement now calling for Assad's removal.

It appeared the regime was making an example of Hama, a religiously conservative city about 130 miles north of the capital, Damascus. The city, with a population of 800,000, has largely fallen out of government control since June as residents turned on the regime and blockaded the streets against encroaching tanks.

The United States and France enraged the government earlier this month when their ambassadors travelled to Hama in a trip designed to demonstrate solidarity with demonstrators. And yesterday's deadly siege only ignited more calls for defiance among protesters.

The Local Coordination Committees, which helps organise anti-government protests, urged people to take to the streets and start a general strike to protest the killings.

An escalation in violence during Ramadan, a time of heightened religious fervour for devout Muslims, would bring a new dimension to the unrest in Syria, which has reached a stalemate in recent weeks.

There have been credible reports of army defections, although it is difficult to gauge how widespread they are. Assad, and his father before him, stacked key military posts with members of their minority Alawite sect, melding the fate of the army and the regime.

The army has a clear interest in protecting the regime because they fear revenge attacks and persecution should the country's Sunni majority gain the upper hand.

The Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said there must not be 'another Hama', meaning another massacre.
