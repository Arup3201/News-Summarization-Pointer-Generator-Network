A veterinary nurse has received a suspended jail sentence after abandoning her starving dog on a Birmingham street, before it was later put down.

A court heard Ann Marie Nash’s emaciated five-year-old bulldog, Martha, had suffered for a 'prolonged' period.

Nash, 38, from Erdington, Birmingham was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment, suspended for a year, after previously admitting animal cruelty.

She was also ordered to do 100 hours unpaid work, pay £200 costs and was banned from keeping any animal for five years.

Julia Kettle, prosecuting for Birmingham City Council, said the bulldog was found collapsed in St Thomas Road, Erdington, on July 10 last year by a dog warden, who had been called out by a concerned member of the public.

She was found to be extremely emaciated and had a swollen stomach and ingrowing nails.

The dog was later examined by a veterinary surgeon who discovered a 'football size' lump in its stomach, which was believed to be a tumour.

Miss Kettle said a medical examination indicated the animal had been suffering for about two weeks.

After the dog was put down, a post mortem examination revealed it had a blockage of bones in its stomach.

Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard that Nash could no longer afford to care for Martha after losing her job and had to rely on food banks to feed herself

Attempts to find the owner led to a rescue centre and then to Nash.

When quizzed the defendant claimed she had given Martha away two weeks previously.

Joanne Outhwaite, defending, said Nash, who had completed her veterinary nurse training 14 years ago, was extremely remorseful for what had happened.

She said she started to suffer from depression seven years ago following the death of her father, had lost her job and found it difficult to cope.

Under stress Nash had taken out the rubbish, Martha had followed her and she had then shut the door on the dog.

She had hoped someone would take her in, her solicitor claimed.

Investigators from Birmingham City Council were able to track down Nash as Martha had been micro-chipped. 

Ms Outhwaite told Birmingham Magistrates' Court that her client had been caring for the dog in an appropriate manner until she had lost her job.

'Miss Nash is extremely remorseful and will remember what has happened for a long time to come.

'She took the dog on because of her position fostering animals. Things started to come to a head when she lost her job and she started suffering from depression.

'She was forced to rely on food banks, was facing eviction and was struggling to maintain her own health.

'She accepts that she should have sought assistance and she sincerely regrets that she was not in a right frame of mind to do so.

Jacqui Kennedy, director of regulation and enforcement for Birmingham City Council, said: 'This sad case highlights how important it is for people to look after their pets and they owe them a duty of care.

'While many pet owners love their animals and take good care of them, ensuring they are well fed and maintained, there are some who do not understand their responsibility, and unfortunately our dog wardens are seeing more of these kinds of cases.

'This is why it’s so important to highlight what can happen to the owner, as well as their pet, if they are neglected or disowned, and the judge was very clear that Miss Nash will go to prison if she breaks the terms of her sentence.'
