An elderly man whose wife of more than 40 years was killed in the Washington mudslide on Saturday has spoken out about his devastating loss.

Gary McPherson, 78, and his wife Linda were sitting beside each other in their recliners at their Snohomish County home on Saturday morning when the mile-long mudslide tore through.

After being thrown through the mud and debris, McPherson's first thought was for his wife.

'I keep trying to talk to Linda, but they tell me she must have been gone by then,' McPherson, who did not break a single bone, told KIRO-TV as he sobbed.

Devastated: Gary McPherson, 78, wipes away tears as he recounts being dug out of mudslide debris as he called out desperately for his wife of 40 years, who did not survive

Ordeal: He was sitting on his recliner chair beside his wife on Saturday when the ground pulled them in

Yelling for his wife to dig, he grabbed a wooden stick from a broken chair, pushed it upwards and moved it from side to side until he could see a small hole of light.

'I kept yelling at Linda to dig,' he told KOMO.

'I was all balled up, but this one hand was free and I had a stick so I just kept digging and digging and digging with this stick until I could see a light and shoved that sucker up through there. And started waving it back and forth.'

He continued to wave the stick until he was found by emergency crews. He kept asking for his wife, but they told him to relax - perhaps a sign they already knew she was dead, he said through tears.

His heartbreaking account comes as officials said on Thursday that they expect the number of fatalities to rise 'substantially'.

Sixteen bodies have been recovered, and by Wednesday night, nine more had been found. On Thursday, the family of a four-month-old baby, Sanoah Huestis, said her body had been found.

The McPhersons daughter, Kate, said she is struggling to grasp that her mother is dead and says that she keeps texting her 'that I miss her, that I want her to be here. And it's not fair that she's gone'.

Her
 parents met as they carried out oceanography research on a ship 
departing Nome, Alaska and had been married for more than 40 years. Mrs 
McPherson was the Darrington librarian.

Victim: 69-year-old Linda, the town librarian, was likely already dead when her husband yelled out to her

Idyllic: The McPhersons lived on the family farm, which had been in their family for five generations

Wreckage: The entire farm - including this home shared by Linda's sister's family - was destroyed

'We were just two people that meshed,' her husband remembered. 'She was gentle, but persuasive. She was a planner.'

Hope of a miracle discovery of a 
survivor has faded as the search entered its sixth day Thursday, 
replaced by acknowledgement that some families may not be able to bury a
 body.

Authorities have been able to 
eliminate 140 people from the list of the missing, said Snohomish County
 Emergency Management Director John Pennington.

That left 90 confirmed missing, with 
another 35 who authorities are unsure were in the area when a hillside 
collapsed Saturday morning 55 miles northeast of Seattle.

Becky
 Bach watches and waits, hoping that search crews find her brother, his 
wife, her 20-year-old great-niece and the young girl's fiance.

'Realistically
 ... I honestly don't think they're going to find them alive,' Bach 
said, crying. 'But as a family, we're trying to figure out what to do if
 they find no bodies.'

Doug Massingale, whose baby granddaughter's body was recovered on Wednesday, said he was struggling to think about the lives lost.

'It's stressful to think about,' he said. 'A little baby that hasn't gotten a start yet in life. It's too much.'

Authorities said they expected to 
update the toll Thursday morning, but trying to recover every corpse 
would be impractical and dangerous.

The
 debris field is about a square mile and 30 to 40 feet deep in places, 
with a surface that includes quicksand-like muck, rain-slickened mud and
 ice. The terrain is difficult to navigate on foot and makes it 
treacherous or impossible to bring in heavy equipment.

To
 make matters worse, the pile is laced with other hazards that include 
fallen trees, propane and septic tanks, twisted vehicles and countless 
shards of shattered homes.

The knowledge that some victims could be abandoned to the earth is difficult to accept.

Loss: On Thursday, the family of a four-month-old baby, Sanoah Huestis, said her body had been found

'We have to get on with our lives at some point,' Bach said.

Bach spoke via phone about a wedding the family had planned for summer at the rural home that was destroyed. And how, she wondered, do you plan a funeral without a body?

'We'll probably just have a memorial, and if they find the bodies eventually, then we'll deal with that then,' she said.

A death certificate, issued by the state, is legal proof that someone has died. Families often need them to settle their affairs.

The authority to issue them starts with a county medical examiner or coroner, said Donn Moyer, spokesman for the Washington State Department of Health. If and when it appears there is no chance of finding someone, people can ask the county to start that process.

Two Washington National Guard Blackhawk helicopters arrived at the site Wednesday to relieve sheriff's helicopter crews that had been working since Saturday.

The Blackhawks' sole mission is body removal, said Bill Quistorf, chief pilot for the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office.

Other survivors began to grow impatient Wednesday that they weren't allowed to return to the sites of their homes to search for their valuables and keepsakes.

'This isn't right. All of us who are still alive need to have access and find what we can of our lives,' said Robin Youngblood, who said her son-in-law was turned away from the slide site.
