Hacker group Anonymous  took down at least two official websites in Florida making good on threats after a city banned feeding the homeless.

In a video claimed to be posted by Anonymous on Monday, an unidentified person wearing a mask and speaking with a digitally-altered voice threatened to crash the sites if the city of Fort Lauderdale didn't lift bans on panhandling at intersections, sleeping in public downtown and feeding the homeless.

The sites FortLauderdale.gov and FLPD.gov were offline for several hours on Monday but back up later that evening.

Hacker group Anonymous on Monday threatened to take down official Fort Lauderdale city websites following a ban on feeding the homeless

Both Fort Lauderdale's main city website (pictured) and that of the police department were down for several hours on Monday following threats from hacker group Anonymous

World War II veteran, 90-year-old Arnold Abbott (pictured) was cited on November 5 along with two pastors for feeding the homeless in a Fort Lauderdale park

The denial of service attack created a web traffic jam forcing the city to shut down the sites as a precaution. The Sun Sentinel reported that no critical services were affected, but people were unable to pay utility bills or find other government information.

City Manager Lee Feldman said that officials were discussing the issue. 

Fort Lauderdale drew national attention last month after police cited 90-year-old Arnold Abbott and two pastors for feeding homeless people at Fort Lauderdale Beach.

Abbott, a World War II veteran, and others served a four-course meal by the beach as a crowd of nearly 100 mostly homeless and volunteers cheered their arrival.  

Despite being charged with violating the new law by feeding the homeless,  Abbott said he's not deterred and even went back out to serve more food at a public park.

Abbott, affectionately known as 'Chef Arnold,' has several programs, including a culinary school to train the homeless and help find them jobs in local kitchens.

He and two South Florida ministers face up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine.

The faceoff in Fort Lauderdale over the ordinance restricting public feeding of the homeless has pitted those with compassionate aims against residents and businesses trying to protect their neighborhoods.

Fort Lauderdale is the latest U.S. city to pass restrictions on feeding homeless people in public places.

Advocates for the homeless say the cities are fighting to control increasing homeless populations but that simply passing ordinances doesn't work because they don't address the root causes.

In the past two years, more than 30 cities have tried to introduce laws similar to Fort Lauderdale's, according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. Harsh winters have driven many homeless people south to states such as Florida.

Mayor Jack Seiler said he thinks Abbott and pastors Dwayne Black and Mark Sims have good intentions, but the city can't discriminate in enforcing the law.

He said it was passed to ensure that public places are open to everyone. He also stressed that the city was working with local charities to help serve the homeless through indoor feedings and programs that get them medical care and long-term help.

'The parks have just been overrun and were inaccessible to locals and businesses,' Seiler said. 

After several hours both affected websites were once again up and running following the denial of service attack which forced the city to shut them down as a precaution

The issue of feeding the homeless has cropped up multiple times during Mr Abbot's long life.

Abbott fought a similar ordinance in court 15 years ago and said he's prepared to mount another legal challenge. In 1999 he sued the City of Fort Lauderdale after he was banned from feeding the homeless on the beach. A court ruled that such a law was against the Constitution.

Other cities are conducting routine homeless sweeps while some have launched anti-panhandling campaigns, according to the coalition. And many laws continue to target public feedings.

In Houston, groups need written consent to feed the homeless in public, or they face a $2,000 fine. Organizations in Columbia, South Carolina, must pay $150 for a permit more than two weeks in advance to feed the homeless in city parks.

In Orlando, an ordinance requires groups to get a permit to feed 25 or more people in parks in a downtown district. Groups are limited to two permits per year for each park. Since then, numerous activists have been arrested for violating the law.

Fort Lauderdale's new law requires groups to be at least 500 feet away from residential properties and food sites are restricted to one per city block, but charities have criticized the rules as forms of implementing social cleansing. 

Similar laws are being looked at by other cities including Seattle, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Dallas, and Philadelphia.
