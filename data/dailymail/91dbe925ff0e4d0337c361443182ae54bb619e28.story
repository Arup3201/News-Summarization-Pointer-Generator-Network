A Level 3 sex offender who won a $10 million state lottery prize in 2008 has pleaded not guilty to charges that he sexually abused a boy for several years and showed him pornography.

Daniel Snay, 62, of Uxbridge, Mass., was arrested on Friday and charged with indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of 14 – a subsequent offense, reckless endangerment of a child, enticement of a child and dissemination of pornography to a minor, police said.

Snay was arraigned at Uxbridge District Court on Monday morning, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Snay, a Level 3 sex offender who won a $10 million state lottery prize in 2008, has denied charges that he sexually abused a boy for several years and showed him pornography

Uxbridge police are working with police 
in Connecticut and Rhode Island as some of the alleged offenses occurred
 in those states. The abuse allegedly occurred when the boy was between 
the ages of 8 and 14.

In 2008, Snay bought a $20 scratch ticket 
at a Cumberland Farms in Hopedale and won $10 million.

Police believe he used his lottery windfall to groom and gain favor with people.

'Snay was the recipient of a $10 million dollar lottery award and that windfall aided the commission of the crimes,' said Chief Jeffrey Lourie.  

He is being held at the police station without bail and will be taken to Uxbridge District Court on Monday for arraignment.

The alleged crimes occurred over a four-year period, reports Telegram.com.

Police said they had been receiving 
reports from concerned residents that Snay was in close contact with 
young children, but it wasn't until recently that someone came forward, 
Chief Lourie said.

'He used [the money] as a means for grooming the victims or enticing 
them because he had this large sum of money at his disposal,' Uxbridge 
Police Department Public Information Officer Melanie Blodgett-O’Toole 
told ABC News.

Snay is being held on $5 million bail, although it is unclear,
 even with his winnings, if he has enough cash available 
to make the payment.

He has been transferred to the Worcester County 
House of Corrections while he awaits his next court date, scheduled for 
April 16.

Snay was convicted six times of indecent assault and battery in the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1974 he received a one-year suspended sentence for indecent assault and battery on a child under 14. He violated probation and was sent to jail for a year.

Then two years later in 1976, Snay was sentenced to serve five to seven years in state prison after he was convicted of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14.
