An officer in the U.S. Navy has been extradited from his deployment in Japan to face charges that he sexually abused pre-teen twin boys.

Brock Mason of Norman, Oklahoma, was charged at Cleveland County District Court on Tuesday.

The 24-year-old is accused of five counts of lewd or indecent acts to a child under 16, one count of lewd or indecent proposal to a child under 16, two counts of forcible sodomy, two counts of soliciting sexual conduct or communication with a minor by use of technology and one count of contributing to the delinquency of minors.

U.S. Navy officer Brock Mason, 24, has been extradited from his deployment in Japan to face charges that he sexually abused pre-teen twin boys whilst attending the University of Oklahoma

The incidents allegedly occurred between January 2012 and November 2013, while Mason was a student at the University of Oklahoma.

According to court documents, Mason allegedly forced the young boys to have sex with him, perform oral sex and masturbate, in exchange for gifts like cash and shoes.

Mason also allegedly gave the boys drugs and forced them to look at pornography.

His victims were between the ages of 11 and 13 at the time of the incidents, the charges state.

Authorities say the single mother of the boys thought Mason was mentoring and helping her sons by spending time with them.

‘They think that person’s just trying
to be their friend and cares about them and so it just gets out of 
control,’ District Attorney Greg Mashburn told KFOR.

The investigation into Mason began after he was allegedly caught downloading child pornography onto his computer.

‘The NCIS, the naval intelligence, got a tip from a cyber line that some child porn had been downloaded onto his computer,’ said Mashburn.

‘So they started digging deeper, started looking at his Facebook, saw some messages with some children here in Norman.’

The investigation is ongoing and prosecutors believe there could be more victims from Oklahoma and even other states.

Mason was booked into the Cleveland County Jail on Dec. 1 and arraigned on Tuesday. His bond was set at $750,000 and he is next due in court on Dec. 17.
