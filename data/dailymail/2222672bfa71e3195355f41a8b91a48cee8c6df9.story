Most of us know we should include fibre in our diet, but as a nation we simply don't eat enough of it.

Despite its many health benefits, which include reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers, our average daily intake of fibre is just 18g - a third lower than the recommended 25g.

Under proposals from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (who advise the Government), this target is likely to rise to 30g.

The trend for avoiding carbohydrates isn't helping, says dietitian Sioned Quirke, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. 

'I see lots of people cutting down on carbohydrate foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta, in an attempt to lose weight, but they jeopardise their health and increase their risk of constipation and bowel conditions such as diverticulitis (where the gut wall weakens) if they don't eat other fibre sources,' she said.

Despite the many health benefits of eating enough fibre, the majority of people don't get their daily recommended 25g. Here we reveal some smart ways to sneak more fibre into your diet - you'll need to choose between three and six items 

Previously called 'roughage', dietary fibre is found in pulses (half a tin of baked beans provides a third of your fibre intake), cereals, fruits, nuts and vegetables - but there is none in meat or animal products such as eggs.

There are two types of fibre - insoluble and soluble - and both are needed to keep us healthy. 'Insoluble fibre makes food move through the digestive tract more quickly, preventing constipation and reducing the time toxins are in contact with the gut, which may reduce bowel cancer risk,' says Sioned Quirke.

Soluble fibre dissolves inside the digestive tract where it forms a thick gel that helps slow the movement of sugars into your blood and reduces the absorption of cholesterol.

High fibre diets are associated with trimmer waistlines - one theory is that fibre fills you up, while another is that some types can be partially digested by friendly gut bacteria, which in turn release chemicals that influence appetite.

To get the recommended 25g of fibre can mean eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, plus two slices of wholemeal bread and a portion each of high fibre breakfast cereal and wholewheat pasta.

To take it to 30g, you'd need to add a large jacket potato.

That can be a daunting menu, so instead here are smart ways to sneak in more fibre - you'll need to choose between three and six items from the list below to get the recommended daily intake of at least 25g (and ideally 30g).
