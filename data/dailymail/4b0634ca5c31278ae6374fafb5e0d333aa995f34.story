The rookie air traffic controller who gave the go-ahead for the jet carrying French oil boss Christophe de Margerie to take off has been jailed amid fears she has been  deprived of sleep and food for days.

Svetlana Krivsun - in her early 20s - appeared in tears in a Moscow court this morning, wearing a hood and with her face covered. 

Earlier union chief Sergey Kovalev claimed she was taken away to detention in handcuffs after she had no sleep or food for two days, and said authorities were treating her like a 'dangerous criminal'.

Svetlana Krivsun appeared in a Moscow court this morning, crying and pleading with the judge to be let out on bail, as her union leader said she had been deprived of sleep and food for three days 

Krivsun, a trainee air traffic controller, is being held with three others after pro-Moscow oil boss Christophe de Margerie died in a plane crash on Monday

Detained: Svetlana Krivsun, believed to be 24, was the 'girl trainee' who gave the order for Christophe de Margerie's doomed jet to take off on the night it crashed

He claimed that the trainee and three other airport officials were detained as 'suspects' over the crash - in which the Falcon business jet struck a snowplough on the runway, killing all four on board including the boss of Total oil.

He said the group were questioned without lawyers before being formally detained.

'We are outraged with the horrendous actions of the Investigative Committee of Russia who have detained and took away our colleagues at 2am on 23 October after 48 hours interrogation,' said Kovalev, president of Russia's Federal Trade Union of Air Traffic Controllers.

'These air traffic controllers before that have just finished their night shift. They were interrogated without lawyers. They treated them like dangerous criminals, they took them out in handcuffs.

'They were morally and physically depressed. They were without food and sleep for almost three days.

'The trainee air traffic controller needed medical help. An ambulance was called. We think that their detention is groundless, they agreed to cooperate with the investigators.'

The union has begun a 'nationwide and international campaign of solidarity with their detained colleagues', he said, claiming a 'decision on whether to strike or protest has not been taken yet'.

He said: 'We will provide them with lawyers and will ensure that air traffic controllers were released from custody.'

Pleading with a court judge to be released on bail, Krivsun said: 'I am a simple trainee controller,' she said from the cage in the Moscow court room.

'I am just learning under the guidance of an experienced professional, obeying his commands.'

The court rejected her bail demand and put her under house arrest until 21 December.

She was forbidden to leave the rented apartment where she lives with her sister and her husband.

She is banned from discussing the case with anyone other than investigators and her lawyer.

The chief engineer of Vnukovo airport Vladimir Ledenyov was remanded in custody after the court was told he 'permitted the snowplough, with driver Vladimir Martynenko at the wheel, to roll onto the airfield without an escort and when the radio contact was lost, he was unable to order the vehicle back, but at the same time failed to warn the control tower.' 

The court also remanded in custody Alexander Kruglov, 40, the air traffic controller who was identified as supervising Krivsun.

'I'm not guilty. I accomplished my duty in full,' he told the court. 

Investigators alleged that 'the detained persons failed to provide safety requirements concerning flights and on-ground works and it led to the tragedy'.

They also strongly denied that the airport employees including Krivsun were 'brutally treated'.

Spokesman Vladimir Markin claimed they were handcuffed because they had refused to present themselves voluntarily for questioning.

'I can say that it had initially been suggested to the suspects that they voluntarily arrive at the Russian Investigative Committee for investigations,' he said.

'The investigators were willing to provide them with transportation for this purpose, but for some reason the airport employees refused.'

As a result, the Investigative Commitee sent detectives to Vnukovo to detain and question the suspects, he said.

'The allegations about violations of the detainees' rights are not true. Lawyers were present at all the interrogations, including the first few sessions.

'There have been no health complaints either from the suspects or from their lawyers. And, of course, it is untrue information that the detainees were treated brutally.'

Earlier it was reported that investigators were seeking house arrest for Krivsun, whose age has been given as between 21 and 25 by the Russian media.

Vladimir Martynenko, the snowplough driver, has been detained in custody for two months.

Alexei Morozov, the head of the commission for investigations into air accidents of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), said: 'The crew saw an object they identified as "a vehicle crossing the runway" 14 seconds after the plane started moving.

'Seeing the object did not cause the crew's concerns and the takeoff continued in the standard manner in accordance with the standard procedures.'

The plane collided with the snowplough 14 seconds later, he said.

Morozov also said the plane was in the air at the time of the commission and its speed was some 248 km/h.

'After the collision, the plane started intensively tilting to the right, which caused the plane to hit the ground. No failures in the work of the plane systems and its engines before the plane hit the ground were registered,' he said.

He claimed that the runway was clear when the air traffic controller gave permission for the takeoff

'When the air traffic controller gave permission for the aircraft to take off, the runway was clear. The crew confirmed the permission for takeoff.'

Approximately ten seconds after the crew confirmed the takeoff permission, 'a snowplough was seen moving on the left side of the snowplow lane towards the intersection,' he said.

The air traffic controller did not receive any request for the snowplow to cross the runway, he stressed.

No conversations were registered after the crew confirmed the permission for takeoff, Morozov said.

Air traffic controller Alexander Alexandrov said: 'Everyone - the snowplough driver and the traffic controllers - were tested for alcohol immediately. 

'If any of the tests had been positive, it would have been announced already.'

But there were complaints about poor equipment used by the airport's air traffic controllers, some of it 30 years old.

'The equipment they are working with right now makes serious mistakes in measurements, so they often do not trust it,' he said.

'False spots often come out on the screen, as if there are planes or cars out there when in reality they are not there. It makes an air traffic controller waste his time to double-check this data.'
