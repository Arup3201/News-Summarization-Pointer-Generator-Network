Angel di Maria must deliver performances worthy of his £60million price tag if Manchester United are to achieve their goal of Champions League football, according to Gary Neville.

Di Maria has failed to live up to his early promise in a Manchester United shirt since his big-money move from Real Madrid in the summer.

And former Manchester United defender Neville is sympathetic to the reasons why the Argentina international has struggled over the last eight months at Old Trafford – but says it is time for him to deliver.

Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, Neville cites the burglary of Di Maria’s house at the end of January, his lack of English and coming to terms with the fact he did not want to leave the Bernabeu in the summer as some of the reasons why he has been off the boil.

Neville said: ‘I fully expected Di Maria and Luke Shaw to form a devastating partnership down the left flank and, even at close to £60m, I had no thoughts whatsoever that his signing was a risk.

‘When he dribbled down the wing at the King Power Stadium before chipping the Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to score his second goal in three games since arriving from Madrid, the United fan in me was so excited and I was thinking, ‘Here we go!’

‘It was an example of everything I expected Di Maria to bring to the Premier League - pace, audacity and a moment of magic capable of turning a game.

‘But since that day, Di Maria has scored just two more goals - one of them coming against Yeovil in the FA Cup - and he has quite simply looked a shadow of his former self.’

‘He has come to United when he did not want to leave Madrid, has suffered the trauma of a burglary, and started to work for a new manager while playing in a team that is still in a ‘storm’ phase of development.

‘All of those are factors that would go some way to explaining why Di Maria has struggled after his bright start, but I feel as though I have a parrot on either shoulder, with one telling me to give the benefit of the doubt because of those reasons while the other is saying that, actually, the time has come for a £60m player to deliver.'

United are still in the top four of the Premier League and face Arsenal at Old Trafford in the Sixth Round of the FA Cup. And if Louis van Gaal’s side are to end the season on a high then Neville says Di Maria will be required to play a major role.

He added: ‘If United are to achieve their aims this season, primarily Champions League qualification, Di Maria is going to have to rid himself of the complexities that have emerged over the past eight months and escape the demons that are playing on his mind.’
