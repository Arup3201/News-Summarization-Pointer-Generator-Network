Needing help: More than 2,100 women have been treated in London hospitals since 2010 for female genital mutilation injuries

More than 2,100 victims of female genital mutilation have been treated in London hospitals since 2010, it emerged today.

Almost 300 women needed surgery to help them recover from the brutal ritual, new figures have revealed.

Among those treated in the capital's hospitals included 12 children, including one girl who had been left with an 'open wound' following the criminal act.

Despite being illegal in the UK, female 
genital mutilation is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 women 
dealing with the after-effects and more than 20,000 young girls thought 
to be at risk.

The procedure is associated with communities in Africa, particularly Mali, Somalia, Sudan and Kenya, as well as some parts of the Middle East.

Many girls living in Britain are taken to these countries for be 'cut', and some will be as young as five.

But it is becoming more prevalent in the UK and  experts say today's figures are 'truly shocking' but there are 'far more victims' than the data shows.

In the majority of cases the clitoris is removed because it gives sexual pleasure.

A total of 2,115 FGM patients were seen between 2010 and now, the Evening Standard has revealed.

Dr Comfort Momoh, a specialist in dealing with these injuries at St Thomas’ Hospital, said: 'These statistics show a very significant number of women are being 
treated for FGM.

'But there are still lots out there who are not being 
identified because they don’t know where to go for help, aren’t being 
referred by GPs or are too scared to come forward.

Nimko Ali was just seven years old when she was taken to Somalia for a 'holiday' where she would be subjected to the horrific procedure.

'There was a woman at the door in a burka. I was scared and instinctively started running. When I was caught, I was taken into a room filled with instruments I didn't recognise,' she said.

'The woman I was so afraid of was there waiting for me. She scolded me for running away, telling me how difficult it was to obtain equipment like this; how ungrateful I was.

'I blacked out before she started cutting. I'm still not sure whether it was the anaesthetic or pure fear'.

When Ali woke, she was
in agony with her legs bound together. Taken back to the Uk two days later, Ali found that friends and teachers were 
unwilling to take her story seriously, leaving her feeling let down and 
alone.

'I’m really 
worried about girls, in particular. Where are they going to seek help? 
The GPs who are their first point of call often don’t have the 
knowledge. We also need teachers and lecturers to do more to at least 
signpost girls towards help.'

Nimko Ali was seven when she underwent Female Genital Mutilation in Somalia and now campaigns against it through her charity  
Daughters of Eve.

'For too long, it has been passed off as a "cultural" ritual. But this act is not about celebration. FGM is gender-based violence, it's as simple as that,' she said.

It came as Director of Public Keir Starmer said it was 'only a matter of time' before there is a prosecution for female genital mutilation.

'I think a prosecution is much closer now than it's been at any stage since this was made a criminal offence in this country,' he said.

'We
 have devised a strategy, and we have now got the intelligence-led 
operations that are bringing us very close to a prosecution.

'I 
do not think that's a failure - that is trying to grapple with a 
difficult problem. If it was easy there would have been a prosecution.'
