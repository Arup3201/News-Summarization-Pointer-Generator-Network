A new book contains hundreds of images, both black-and-white and in color, showing John F. Kennedy's 1960 quest for the presidency. 

The photos show multiple events, including Kennedy speaking on the campaign trail, supporters carrying signs at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Kennedy at his presidential inauguration, and the soon-to-be president even at a grocery store.

Kennedy's wife, and future first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, is also seen, as well as his younger brother Bobby Kennedy.

The images are included in Taschen's recently published 'Norman Mailer. JFK. Superman Comes to the Supermarket.'

Spread throughout the 370-page book is the text of Mailer's 1960 essay 'Superman Comes to the Supermarket,' which is widely considered part of the 'New Journalism' style.  

An introduction for the book, penned by J. Michael Lennon, says the ideal for Mailer's article came from Esquire editor Clay Felker. 

Though Kennedy believed television helped him win against Republican candidate Richard Nixon, Norman Mailer thought it was his own essay, a release for the book notes.

Mailer said in a 1962 Esquire issue 'So if I came to the cool conclusion I had won the election for Kennedy with my piece in Esquire, the thought might be high presumption, but it was not unique. I had done some-thing curious but indispensable for the campaign — succeeded in making it dramatic.

'I had not shifted one hundred thousand votes directly, I had not. But a million people might have read my piece and some of them talked to other people. The cadres of Stevenson Democrats whose morale was low might now revive with an argument that Kennedy was different in substance from Nixon. Dramatically different.'

Taschen says its new book includes 300 photographs taken by multiple photographers, including Stanley Tretick, Henri Dauman, Cornell Capa and Laurence Schiller, among others.

'Norman Mailer. JFK. Superman Comes to the Supermarket' is now available for purchase.
