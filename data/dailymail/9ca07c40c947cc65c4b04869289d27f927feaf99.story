Jamie Anderson had the eyes of the world on her when she took gold in the slopestyle at the Winter Olympics.

And the snowboarding star is once again the centre of attention as she stripped down to pose for the front cover of ESPN's latest magazine.

It's certainly a different sight to when we last saw the American at Sochi in February, where the 23-year-old was on the top step of the podium after winning the inaugural slopestyle event.

As one of many stars chosen to grace the front of a special body issue, Anderson only kept on her snowboarding goggles as she covered up.

Tennis ace Venus Williams was also chosen to be one of the cover stars, as well as record breaking Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps who posed for an artistic shot underwater.

It wasn't all about chiseled out athletes though as baseball star Prince Fielder also took a swing at appearing on one of the covers.
