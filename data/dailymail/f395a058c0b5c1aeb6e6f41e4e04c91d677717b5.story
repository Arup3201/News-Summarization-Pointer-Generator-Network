Oscar Pistorius has reportedly been dating a student paramedic in the weeks leading up to his trial for the murder of his ex-girlfriend.

The double amputee met 19-year-old Leah Skye Malan in Mozambique last December while she was holidaying with her mother, father and younger brother.

Miss Malan, who is the Paralympian's first girlfriend since he shot model Reeva Steenkamp last year, has been supporting him in the run-up to his court case, it was reported by The Sun.

A source told the paper: 'They both seem really into each other.

'She's helped support him through this difficult time and has introduced him to all her family. They have embraced him.'

Her father Andre may even attend the trial which starts on Monday.

The pair have been on a number of dates, but Pistorius is believed to have disguised himself while out.

Miss Malan has also invited the 27-year-old to her family's farmhouse in near Potchefstroom, around two hours from Johannesburg where she studies at university.

The revelations emerged as dramatic 
new video was released showing Pistorius using a shotgun at a firing 
range months before he fatally shot his model girlfriend.

Sky
 News, which published the footage, also revealed a series of 
photographs showing the Paralympian firing the same silver 9mm pistol he
 used when he killed Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.

The prosecution says he had a fight 
with Reena Steenkamp before killing her by firing shots through a door 
in the bathroom of his home on February 14 last year.Â

He says he shot the model and reality TV star after mistaking her for a dangerous intruder in the night.

On the anniversary of her death on Valentine's Day, Pistorius claimed her death was a 'devastating accident'.

Pistorius, 27, known as Blade Runner, posted the letter on his official Oscar Pistorious website.

'No
 words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident
 that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved - and 
continues to love Reeva,' he said.
