A teenager used a fake Facebook profile to lure the love rival who fell pregnant by her boyfriend to an empty property where she attacked her so viciously that she broke her eye socket.

Abigail Moody flew into a jealous rage and brutally attacked Melissa Benhamou after finding out she had slept with her partner Sam Bridge, Worcester Crown Court heard.

Moody, a former care worker, pretended to be Mr Bridge on Facebook to lure the victim to her flat in Bromsgrove, on November 17 last year.

But when Miss Benhamou arrived, the 19-year-old grabbed her hair, and kicked and punched her to the ground. 

She smacked her the young woman's head against a radiator, fracturing her eye socket - before Moody chastised her victim for getting blood on her trainers.

Worcester Crown Court heard she also insulted her Pakistani heritage before leaving her in a pool of blood.

Abigail Moody has been given 18 months in a young offender's institute after the attack

Moody, from Bromsgrove, was yesterday sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders institution after admitting racially aggravated grievous bodily harm.

Sentencing, Judge Robert Juckes QC, said: 'This matter was a well planned, carefully thought out assault on a girl.

'It was a vicious attack, accompanied by racial abuse.'

Prosecutor Peter Grice said the two women had been friends until April 2012, when Moody assaulted Miss Benhamou because she had slept with her boyfriend.

In April last year, she slept with Moody's boyfriend once again and became pregnant before miscarrying the baby weeks later.

Mr Grice told the court that Miss Benhamou was contacted on Facebook by a profile in the name of the unfaithful boyfriend - but it was Moody posing as him.

She tricked her former friend into going to an address and Moody even arranged for a taxi to bring her there.

On arrival, Miss Benhamou was sent a message telling her the door was open and to walk straight in.

But, in the corridor outside the flat, Moody 'lay in ambush' and grabbed her by the hair before dragging her inside.

She racially abused her and stamped on Miss Benhamou's phone after she knocked it to the ground.

The court was told Miss Benhamou slept with Moody's boyfriend twice, falling pregnant the second time, before miscarrying the baby a few weeks later

Mr Grice said: 'The defendant repeatedly punched her victim, causing the victim to hit her head against a radiator.'

Moody then accused Miss Benhamou of getting blood on her trainers and said: 'You slept with my man - you got pregnant with his kid.'

Eventually the victim, who suffered a fractured eye socket, a possible blood clot in her eye, bruising and a chipped tooth, went to a nearby food outlet to get help.

John Lynch, defending, said it was a 'nasty assault' and Moody had given a full and frank account of it to police.

After the case, Miss Benhamou, 23, said she was left with life-changing injuries at the hands of her former best friend.

The health care assistant added: 'It was so terrifying. The first thing I remember seeing was a fist in my eye.

'I didn't know who was punching me at first.

'I thought it was Sam, but when she spoke I knew immediately it was Abi.

'She was calling me a p**i and just kept hitting me and hitting me.

'You see things like this on soaps, but you never think it will happen to you.

'After the attack I went into shock.

'I had a metal plate put in my face because the bone under my eye was completely destroyed.

'My face is still numb to this day because she damaged the nerve. It still hurts even now.

'I can't believe my friend could do that to me. I was devastated. We used to live together and were really close.

'She was messaging me on Facebook pretending to be Sam.

'She was saying come on over I'm not with Abi anymore and I really want to see you.

'I caved too easily and went along to see him. They weren't flirty messages or anything like that but I went along in the end. I wish to this day I hadn't.

'I have nothing to do with Sam anymore. He thought he was a bit of a player. We both knew him and I regret what happened but I just want to move on with my life now.

'I'm glad she has been jailed because I have been left with life-changing injuries. It's been a nightmare ordeal.'
