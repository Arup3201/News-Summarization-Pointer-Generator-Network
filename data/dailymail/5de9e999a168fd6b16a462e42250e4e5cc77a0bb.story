Heston Blumenthal and his ex-wife Zanna (pictured in 2009). The chef has credited her with introducing him to mindfulness meditation

He once admitted chasing  his enemies with a meat cleaver  during a spectacular fit of rage.

But Heston Blumenthal has revealed his legendary temper is now under control thanks to a surprising technique – food-based ‘mindful meditation’.

After trying faith-healing and cranial osteopathy the celebrity chef, who is famed for his bizarre culinary creations, has learned to unwind by concentrating his thoughts on what he eats.

In an interview with Radio Times the 47-year-old was described as still in the process of divorcing his wife Zanna – who first encouraged him to seek help for his anger – more than two years after they split.

However, he explained he has not given up in his quest for self-control, saying: ‘Mindfulness is just  brilliant. You can be mindful with a raisin, even. You look at the raisin – how does it feel?

‘Look at the light and the dark and wonder where the shadows have been cast.

'You draw that out for a minute or two and then you put it in your mouth, and focus on your lips, tongue, teeth… It’s about being completely in the moment.’

He said his anger-management is so successful that he has not lost his cool at all in recent years, adding: ‘Not even a frown. It’s like I’m a different person. Really weird.’

Mr Blumenthal has admitted to once chasing someone who enraged him with a meat cleaver, but is now feeling much calmer

The self-taught chef was first encouraged to seek help for his fiery temper by 48-year-old Zanna, with whom he has three children. He later revealed he saw a cranial osteopath, a therapist and a faith healer on her suggestion.

New love: Heston is now dating writer Suzanne Pirret

Their 20-year marriage came to an end in 2011 after the stress of managing his multi-million-pound food empire took its toll on their relationship.

He subsequently started dating 47-year-old American actress turned cookery writer Suzanne Pirret, with whom he now lives.

But in his latest interview, Blumenthal made the surprising revelation that he has yet to divorce his wife. He said: ‘The divorce is taking quite a long time but we are on the same page and we can communicate.’

Earlier this year Blumenthal spoke frankly about his long struggle to control his temper. He said: ‘Once, I really went for someone. I was in my car and chased someone right down the middle of a High Street – in reverse. I wasn’t very good at expressing emotion, so it was much easier to punch people. It was almost bordering on the psychotic.

‘Oh God, and there was that thing with the gun and the meat cleaver. Some cowboy builders sent some heavies round to my gran’s to get their money and I lost it and pulled a gun out – my dad had it for shooting crows – and chased them with a meat cleaver. They didn’t get their money.’

Blumenthal, who is filming Channel 4 series Heston’s Great British Food, is renowned for his adventurous brand of cooking he describes as ‘molecular gastronomy’.

He has lucrative advertising deals with Waitrose and owns Michelin-starred restaurant The Fat Duck in Berkshire.

But he revealed he does not want his eldest son Jack, 21, to follow him in his career, saying: ‘He wants to go into cooking but I told him, “I’ll push you away. I’m going to keep dissuading you because the only reason you should ever become a chef is because you want to do it so hard, and you’re going to have to work so hard at it”.’
