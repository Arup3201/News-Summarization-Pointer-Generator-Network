San Diego’s horn dog mayor has been banned from the city’s Hooters restaurants.

Fresh out of a two week treatment for sexual addiction, San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has been banned from Hooters restaurants in his city, according to a spokesperson. Signs have even been posted in the front windows of each location.

The ban was first discovered Monday by Francis Barraza, the executive director of the Republican Party of San Diego, and shared in a tweet.

Barraza tweeted an image of a sign in a local Hooters with the caption ‘My local hooters won't serve Bob Filner.’

A Hooters spokesperson told Slate that all San Diego Hooters have banded together to ban their depraved mayor.

‘The signs went up at our four locations in San Diego this morning,’ Melissa Fry, director of marketing for HootWinc, the west coast Hooters franchise, told the site. ‘It's not a political move for us in any way, shape, or form. We're strictly taking a stand for the fair treatment of women. At our franchise alone, we employ 1100 beautiful, talented women.’

Slate also noted that Hooters appears to have taken the signs straight from Glenn Beck.

Filner rose to the national consciousness after a series of city staffers accused him of sexual harassment, spelling out lurid details to local media.

One woman even accused the disgraced politician of putting her in a head lock, dragging her around the office ‘like a rag doll’ and asking when they could have sex after telling her on multiple occasions to ‘come to work without panties,’ she accused in a lawsuit.

At a press conference announcing the suit, the accuser called for Filner to resign and said that ‘A man who lacks character makes a mockery of his ideas.’

Gloria Allred, the woman’s lawyer, added that the degenerate mayor needs to stop ‘treating women as pieces of meat.’

A total of 14 women have accused Filner of sexual harassment, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The accusations have caused the city government to distance themselves from the dishonorable Filner, even suing him for any liabilities incurred as a result of his allegedly awful behavior.

A rising tide of public sentiment against the randy Democrat has even led to several city councilmen calling for a public recall of Filner and for prominent state politicians, including Senator Barbara Boxer, to publicly ask him to resign, according to reports.

Despite a two week absence, Filner is taking yet another leave from his post, according to the Times, which reported the mayor will take ‘personal time’ this week.

Charges have not yet been filed against Filner, but investigators are talking to many of the women who have accused him of lewd behavior.
