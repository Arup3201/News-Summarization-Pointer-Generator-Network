A teenage beauty queen left with 25 per cent burns across her face and body after a horrific accident has vowed to fight for the title of Miss Leeds.

Lucy Morgan, 18, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, went up in flames when a can of flammable liquid exploded as she and a group of friends sat round a bonfire.

She was rushed to hospital following the accident on March 9 - which left her with painful burns, particularly to her legs.

Her ordeal happened just one week after the 
teen was chosen as one of the finalists for the Miss Leeds beauty 
pageant on March 1.

Despite being unable to walk properly and with bandages, scars and red marks on her face, body, hands and legs, Miss Morgan has decided she wants to stay in the competition.

Speaking about her ordeal, she said: 'I remember rolling on the grass and shouting for 
people to get me water, but the flames wouldn’t go out. My friend put 
the flames out with a blanket.

'I thought about dropping out [of the competition] but I am lucky, it could have been a lot worse, I could have lost my sight.'

Finalists for Miss Leeds were announced after auditions on March 1 - and the accident took place eight days later on March 9.

She was taken to Pinderfields Hospital burns unit, in Wakefield, West Yorkshire - where her burns were bandaged.

In a series of Facebook posts, taken between the 14 and 21 March, the teen showed off her extensive facial scars and the healing process.

Over the week, the red burns can be seen progressively healing, until they can barely be seen.

Miss Morgan, who wants to be a paramedic, has also undergone three skin graft 
operations  - including one on the 21 March - with skin taken from her 
leg used on her hands.

Despite extensive surgery, Miss Morgan is still hopeful of her chances of taking part in the competition.

Miss Morgan added: 'The final is on May 10 and I might still be bandaged up and it might be hard for me to walk but I want to take part.

'People think you need to be perfect to be a beauty queen but I am still going to do it anyway. On Facebook people have been saying really nice things and have been so supportive.

'It’s so nice to know people are supporting me, without them I wouldn’t be able to take part.

'I always pick the positives out of everything and this has just made me stronger.'

Miss Morgan, who is a keen horsewoman and is determined to get back in the saddle despite the burns to her legs, has the backing of Harrogate Skills 4 Living Centre where she works part-time as a charity fundraising coordinator.

She has previously organised a charity horse ride to raise funds for breast cancer care UK and says she will continue charity fundraising when she leaves hospital.

She said: 'I want to try and do some fundraising for the burns unit, the staff here have been fantastic and there is a lot to build the confidence of children who have been burned.'

Miss Morgan is recovering in in hospital where she will remain until the end of the month.

The student is determined to fight for her place in the pageant while raising awareness of the charities she has chosen to support for her campaign.

Speaking from hospital today, Miss Morgan said: 'People think you need to be perfect to be a beauty queen but I am still going to do it anyway.'

The beauty queen came third in last year’s Miss Harrogate contest and has remained friends with winner Olivia Craven who is backing Lucy’s bid to be Miss Leeds.

The winner of the competition will go on to enter Miss England.

Miss Morgan says her family and friends have been supportive throughout her ordeal.

Sister Colleen King said: 'Lucy is an inspiration. She will have a go at anything and never says no. She is truly one of life's triers.'

One, Diane Stacey, wrote on Facebook: 'So very well done. Been thinking about you all the time iv'e been away .Hope to see you soon keep smiling.'

Another, Shane Byrne, wrote: 'Get well soon Lucy you seem to be doing great and healing very well keep it up nice to see you smiling x'

Another, Christine Walton, wrote: 'Well done Lucy your so brave. Your face pics are amazing keep up on the mending xxx'
