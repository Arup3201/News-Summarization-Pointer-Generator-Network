Lecture: Rt Rev Richard Chartres, 65, accuse his own generation of taking too much from society

Baby boomers should take less from society because they are now ‘absorbing’ too much taxpayers’ money, a senior Church of England cleric has said.

Those born in the post-war period are the ‘fortunate generation’ because they enjoyed huge improvements in standards of living during their lifetimes, said the Bishop of London, the Rt Rev Richard Chartres.

But there were ‘severe questions’ about the share of government spending allocated to the group, he said.

At the age of 65, the Rt Rev Chartres 
is a classic member of the very group he criticises, but he said that 
many now believe the best times could be ‘behind us’.

He said the first years of the 21st 
century had seen a dramatic transformation and likened them to the 
unstable period in the run-up to the First World War.

Making his comments in a lecture 
organised by religious broadcaster and publisher Premier Christian 
Media, the Bishop added fuel to the debate over whether the elderly can 
be protected from further austerity cuts.

Last week Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls 
sparked fury when he announced that Labour would cap state pensions.

Bishop Chartres took as his theme for the lecture the meaning of William
Blake’s Jerusalem, arguing that the poem’s image of building a better 
future ‘in England’s green and pleasant land’ could still be achieved, 
but not necessarily in purely economic terms.

‘Much of that is absorbed by the fortunate generation to which I belong in ways which raise questions – severe questions – of intergenerational equity,’ he said.

‘The world is being rebalanced: economic 
and military’s power is shifting eastward, the period of unchallengeable
western hegemony after 250 years is at an end.

‘Previous periods marked by the rise of new powers have led to war.

Lucky generation: The Rt Rev Chartres said baby boomers are the fortunate ones thanks to the huge improvements in life quality they have enjoyed

‘We only have to think back to the disastrous European civil war of 1914-1918 to realise the truth that even the interdependent character of the modern global economy is no insurance against mutually destructive conflict.’

He added that in current times the Government’s financial clout remains ‘massive’, with public spending rising from around £26 billion in 1997 to nearly £695 billion last year.

But figures published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last year showed that while elderly people make up about 15 per cent of the population in the leading economies, they account for 40 per cent of all public social spending.

Welfare for British pensioners accounts for about £110 billion of the total £165 billion spent on benefits.

In contrast to the bishop’s views, a study by the Centre for Economic and Business Research, commissioned by Saga, concluded that over-65s are aiding economic recovery.

It argued that, rather than draining resources, the ‘silver pound’ pumps billions into the economy.
