Radamel Falcao arrived in England to much fanfare after completing a  loan move to Manchester United during the summer.

However, with injury limiting him to just 12 Premier League appearances, Falcao has struggled for form and managed just three goals.

United blogger Scott Saunders, who contributes to 90min.com, discusses why manager Louis van Gaal should steer clear of securing Falcao on a permanent deal.

We’ve all learned by now that football’s transfer market can be an expensive, hit-or-miss business. With so much attention and pressure on today’s leading Premier League stars, many have and will continue to falter under the expectation.

The latest man under the spotlight - who is still fighting to prove himself in the Premier League - is Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao.

And it’s a battle he’s currently losing, much to the disappointment of Man United fans.

When news broke that the Colombian had signed last summer, supporters could have been excused spells of giddiness. The prospect of the former Monaco forward lining up alongside Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie was the stuff of dreams.

With Angel di Maria making his way to Manchester just a week before, you’d have been forgiven for thinking Louis van Gaal was creating the Premier League’s version of Real Madrid’s ‘Galacticos’. 

The ‘Gaal-acticos’, they were christened. Doubt even crept in regarding how each player would fit in, with £37million man Juan Mata not even guaranteed a place in the starting XI despite only signing eight months before.

The arrivals were an important statement, a message to the footballing world that the old Manchester United were back. The David Moyes debacle of the previous season was firmly put behind them.

Inevitably with big-name acquisitions, it means big money. With Di Maria, Mata and Falcao, it was no different. The two midfielders have gone some way to justifying their astronomical fees - Mata’s goal and assist record is respectable, whilst Di Maria’s style of play is something United have missed since the days of Cristiano Ronaldo. The Argentine’s pace and directness will pay off.

But in Falcao, heavy doubt remains. Since joining he’s looked a shell of the player that once destroyed Chelsea with a four-goal European Super Cup final haul.

Of course, Falcao’s struggles with injury have had a huge bearing on the impact he’s made but three goals in over 650 minutes of football isn’t good enough for one of the world’s deadliest finishers, no matter which way you look at it.

Doubt amongst Man United fans remains as to whether Falcao will be a success at Old Trafford

Falcao - especially recently - has been given first-team opportunities and shown little aptitude in terms of taking them. His first touch is often disastrous and while his ‘fox-in-the-box’ instincts don’t seem to have deserted him, United need a forward who will offer more in their build-up play.

Given it will cost them around £40m to keep the player beyond this season - and throwing in to the mix the fact that Falcao turns 29 next month - it makes such an expensive transfer seem wildly unjustifiable.

United deserve some credit in terms of the deal they initially agreed with Monaco, covering their own backs with a short-term commitment in spite of the mind-boggling £265,000 he is paid each week.

But their foresight will be meaningless should they go on to complete a permanent transfer - the second most expensive in the club’s history - for a player who has done little to prove he is anywhere near as good as he used to be and with ongoing injury problems.

It’s a risk not worth taking in my eyes.
