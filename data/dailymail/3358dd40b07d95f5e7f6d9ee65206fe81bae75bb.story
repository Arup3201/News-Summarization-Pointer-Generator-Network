A stuntman not satisfied with the thrill of driving a powerful Harley Davidson down the highway took it one step further - by launching the vehicle into the sky.

The motorcycle was strapped to a paraglider and launched off of the foothills around Mount Timpanogos in Utah, around 50 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.

Steve Mayer, owner of a local paragliding store, drove the hog on its flights, which saw it climb as high as 500ft above the hilly ground.

The 700lbs motorcycle was lifted into the sky by the powerful winds which are common in the area.

It hit of high winds to lift off the ground, but as the vehicle pitches and soars, the whoops of excitement from Mayer are evident.

A manager at the Timpanogos Harley Davidson dealership told MailOnline the idea of the video was to push the Harley's association with fun and adventure - as well as just to see if they could.

Jared Willardsen, a local stunt director who coordinated the flight, told extreme sports site Grind TV: 'Because the Harley-Davidson weighs over 700 pounds, it was really hard for us the get the right winds and weather for Steve to fly successfully.

'We had been working on the project for over a year, and I’m glad we didn’t kill Steve in the process - there were a few close calls.'
