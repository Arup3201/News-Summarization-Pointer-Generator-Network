England captain Eoin Morgan has urged his team-mates to 'stand up' to the next World Cup challenge of New Zealand after overseeing a humbling opening-day defeat to Australia.

Morgan's men suffered a crushing 111-run loss in Melbourne after Australia plundered 342 for nine - the highest score England had ever conceded at a World Cup.

The visitors could only reply with 231 in 41.5 overs and next up in Pool A are New Zealand, who host Morgan's team in Wellington next week.

Morgan told Sky Sports World Cup Live: 'They'll probably be the toughest two games of the group stage and we know they're a good test of where we're at.

'If we keep testing ourselves against the best sides and learning as the tour progresses, hopefully we'll hit our straps come the quarter-finals.

'But I think the senior players have got to stand up, myself included, and lead the way from the front.'

The Irishman admitted England had fielded poorly, with Australian centurion Aaron Finch among the big-hitters dropped on Saturday.

'I think we probably let ourselves down in the field - we didn't have a great day there. I think we needed all guns firing to chase down 340,' added Morgan.

'That's probably the most frustrating thing. We started a little bit slowly and a bit cold, which again has been disappointing.'

Reflecting on the positives, Morgan praised Steven Finn following his five-wicket haul - which included a hat-trick - and pointed to the unbeaten 98 from James Taylor.

He added: 'Finny taking the second five-for on this tour has been great and James Taylor was clearly very unlucky not to get a hundred at the end, as he struck the ball very cleanly.'

Australia were largely indebted to Victorian batsman Finch, who hit 135 from 128 balls on his home ground.

'It was nice, a little bit surreal and it will take time for it to sink it but it's a great feeling to get a win first up,' he said.

'It's always a little bit iffy the first game of the tournament and there were a few nerves about but it's nice to get that out of the way.

'Everyone contributed right through the order with either bat or ball, or did something special in the field, so it's a great feeling to get this one out of the way and hopefully we'll take a lot of momentum through the rest of the tournament.'

Australia next tackle Bangladesh in Brisbane on February 21.
