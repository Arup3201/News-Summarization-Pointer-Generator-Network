Drug kingpin: Business tycoon Lo Hsing Han, 80, died at his home in Rangoon, Burma, on Saturday

A former drug kingpin and business tycoon once dubbed the 'Godfather of Heroin' by the U.S. government has died at his home in Burma, a source close to his family said.

Lo Hsing Han, 80, who was considered to be one of the world's biggest traffickers of heroin, died on Saturday in Rangoon, the source said, citing a relative of the former drug kingpin.

His family yesterday held a private ceremony where his body was placed in a glass coffin so visiting relatives, senior government officials and business leaders could pay their final respects.

An obituary announcement submitted by 
the family in the Burmese language Myanma Ahlin daily today said his 
funeral would be held on July 17.

Lo Hsing Han's involvement in the drug trade began more than four decades ago.

In exchange for heading a local militia set up by then-dictator Ne Win in the 1960s to help fight local communists in the region of Kokang, Lo Hsing Han was given permission to engage in the trafficking of opium and heroin, said Bertil Lintner, author of The Golden Triangle Opium Trade: An Overview.

With one of the best-armed militias in the country, he quickly became one of the region's most powerful drug kingpins.

Thai police arrested Lo Hsing Han in 
northern Thailand in 1973. He was handed over to the Burmese government 
and sentenced to death - commuted later to life in prison - for treason.

He was released in 1980 as part of a general amnesty, Mr Lintner said.

In
1992, Lo Hsing Han and his son Stephen Law founded the conglomerate 
Asia World, allegedly as a front for their ongoing dealings in the drug 
trade, the author said.

They
quickly became two of Burma's biggest business tycoons, helping prop up
the military junta, winning contracts to run ports, build highways and 
oversee airports.

The US Department of Treasury, dubbing Lo Hsing Han the 'Godfather of Heroin', put him on the financial sanctions list in 2008.
