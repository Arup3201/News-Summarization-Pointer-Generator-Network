The annual American Fitness Index was released today, which ranks the health of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country and taking the number one spot for the third year running are the twin cities of Minneapolis-St.Paul.

Every year, the health and medical experts at the American College of Sports Medicine look at the 50 most populous towns in America to judge which the healthiest and most fit.

The group looks at many factors that contribute to health, including: smoking, obesity rates, access to health care, availability of parks, recreational facilities, walking trails, and farmers’ markets.

Champs: For the third year in a row, Minneapolis-St. Paul are the fittest cities in America according to an analysis by the American College of Sports Medicine. Pictured are participants in the popular Twin Cities Marathon

This year, Twin Cities came out on top.

‘What Minneapolis has done brilliantly is put their resources where residents can use them effectively to maintain a high level of physical activity,’ Walt Thompson, a professor of exercise physiology at Georgia State University and chairman of the board that created the fitness index, told USA Today.

‘We really believe that if people don't have the environment to exercise, they probably won't,’ Thompson said.

Minneapolis-St. Paul goes to considerable lengths to give people that environment. According to Thompson, the city spends double the amount of money on parks per capita as some other cities. He also says they win with baseball diamonds, ball parks, playgrounds, and dog parks.

Last place: Due to a poor showing in areas like number of smokers and obesity rate, Oklahoma City took the number 50, and lowest, spot on the 2013 American Fitness Index

The Twin Cities see an overall lower incidence of heart disease and diabetes when compared with cities lower on the list. It also sees and overall higher rate, compared to those cities, of physical activity, use of public transit, and bicycling or walking to work.

Since 2007, the American College of Sports Medicine has used data such as a city's obesity rate, access to outdoor recreation areas, smoking rate, and many other indicators of health in order to rank the nation's 50 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas by level of fitness. The top 25 are as follows:

1. Minneapolis-St. Paul2. Washington, D.C.3. Portland, Ore.4. San Francisco5. Denver6. Boston7. Sacramento8. Seattle9. Hartford, Conn.10. San Jose11. Austin12. Salt Lake City13. Cincinnati14. San Diego15. Raleigh, N.C.16. Pittsburgh17. Baltimore18. Virginia Beach19. Cleveland20. Richmond, Va.21. Atlanta22. Providence23. Buffalo24. New York City25. Philadelphia

The opposite seems to be true for the cities that take up the bottom of the yearly list. At number 50, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was deemed the least fit city in America.

Oklahoma City’s poor showing was the result, in part, for high rates of smoking, obesity, asthma, and diabetes. The city also has fewer parks per capita, dog parks, swimming pools, tennis courts, and other recreational areas.

Thompson urges cities struggling to get off the bottom of the list and improve the lives of its residents by imposing smoking bans in public places, for instance, and by facilitating exercise by devoting money to parks and recreation.

‘We have issued the American Fitness Index each year since 2008 to help health advocates and community leader advocates improve the quality of life in their hometowns,’ Thompson said. ‘As urban areas attract more and more residents, it’s imperative for cities to create a built environment, fund amenities and form policies that get residents active and encourage healthy lifestyles.’

Whereas Minneapolis-St. Paul devoted $227 per capita on park-related expenses for its residents, Oklahoma City devoted just $61.

Taking rest of the top five spots were: Washington, DC; Portland, Oregon; San Francisco, California; and Denver, Colorado.

The bottom five included: Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; San Antonio, Texas; Detroit, Michigan; and Oklahoma City.

And though the study’s findings that largely Southern or impoverished (or both) towns take up the bulk of the bottom half of its list, there were some surprises.

Los Angeles, a city whose very name conjures images of trim beach bodies, outdoor sports, and fitness crazes, came up short in the list. The City of Angeles only made it to No. 29, due in part to the car-dependent town’s relatively low physical activity rate and relative lack of designated recreation areas.

Slim city: Hip and healthy Portland, Oregon came in at number 3, based in part on the city's ample parkland and low obesity rate

Even further down the list was another town often associated with beauty and vitality. Miami, as part of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, Florida metropolitan area, was all the way down at No. 42. Though the cities have a relative abundance of swimming pools, they lost points for lack of city parks and a higher rate of poor mental health and low physical activity.

Minneapolis-St.Paul-Bloomington was chosen as this year’s fittest metropolitan statistical area (MSA), as it was in 2012 and 2011.

According to the study’s website, MSAs are used instead of cities because ‘residents outside the city limits have access to fitness-related resources in their suburban area as well as the city core’ and vice-versa.

No smoking: San Francisco's lower smoking rate and abundance of farmer's markets helped the city with a number 4 showing
