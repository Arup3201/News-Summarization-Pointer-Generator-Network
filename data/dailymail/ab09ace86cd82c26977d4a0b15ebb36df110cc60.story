Premier LeagueAug 17, 2013: Sunderland 0-1 FulhamAug 24, 2013: Southampton 1-1 SunderlandAug 31, 2013: Crystal Palace 3-1 SunderlandOct 5, 2013: Sunderland 1-2 Man United

Capital One CupAug 27, 2013: Sunderland 4-2 MK Dons

If Gus Poyet thought life was tough at the bottom of the Barclays Premier League, it got a whole lot worse when it emerged that Sunderland fielded Ji Dong-won in four top-flight matches when he was ineligible.

Club secretary Liz Coley departed abruptly after the administrative error left Sunderland facing a Premier League investigation for breaching rules B14.5 and U11.

In action: Ji Dong-Won (centre) while with Sunderland in a game against Fulham in August 2013

The
 League have fined the club substantially but not deducted points 
despite an FA statute saying they should have been docked or made to 
replay their game against Southampton in August, when Ji helped them win
 a point.

Sunderland were also fined by the Football League after striker Ji played in a 4-2 victory over MK Dons in the Capital One Cup when he wasn’t eligible to play.

MK Dons are understood to be furious 
that Sunderland were not thrown out of the competition once the error 
was spotted.

They went on to lose in the final against Manchester City.

The
 22-year-old South Korea striker, who joined Sunderland in 2011, was 
sent out on loan to German club Augsburg last season.

Game over: Ji rounds Manchester City's Joe Hart to score the winner back in 2012

Bright future: Ji, 22, has impressed while in Germany with Augsburg

The Premier League Handbook 2013/14...

Relationship between Clubs and the League

B.14.5. the statutes and regulations of FIFA.

International registration transfer certificates

U.11. An application to register a player who last played for a club affiliated to a national association other than the Football Association shall be accompanied by written confirmation from the Football Association that an international registration transfer certificate has been issued in respect of the player

According to the Football Association's Standardised Rules 2013/14:

6.9 Playing an ineligible player

Any club found to have played an ineligible player in a match shall have any points gained from that match deducted from its record and have levied upon it a fine.

The company may vary this decision in respect of the points gained only in circumstances where the ineligibility is due to the failure to obtain an International Transfer Certificate or where the ineligibility is related to the player’s status only. 

The board may also order that such match be replayed on such terms as are decided by the board which may also levy penalty points against the club in default.

When he returned, 
Sunderland had to wait for international clearance before he could play 
for them but they never got it.

Instead
 former manager Paolo Di Canio selected him for the four fixtures and 
the mistake was not spotted until they had lost 2-1 at home to 
Manchester United on October 5.

Sunderland immediately confessed and were discreetly fined by the Premier League board in December.

Premier
 League rule B14.5 obliges its member clubs to abide by the statutes and
 regulations of FIFA, and in this case Sunderland failed to comply with 
the European body’s transfer regulations.

Furthermore,
 rule U11 states: ‘An application to register a player who last played 
for a club affiliated to a national association other than the Football 
Association shall be accompanied by written confirmation from the 
Football Association that an international registration transfer 
certificate has been issued in respect of the player.’

Sunderland did not have the written confirmation from the German FA that the player’s international clearance had been received.

FA
 rules say clubs found to have fielded an ineligible player shall be 
fined and have points gained from that match deducted, though a 
deduction way be waived in certain circumstances.

If
 Sunderland are relegated, their players will have to take a 40 per cent
 pay cut.

Outbound: Ji was a Sunderland player between June 2011 and January 2014

Scandal: Club secretary Liz Coley (left) has left Sunderland in the wake of the furore surrounding Ji (pictured with Augsburg)

Vital: Emanuele Giaccherini scored early for Sunderland to grab a point against Southampton in August

The stipulation is understood to be standard across playing 
contracts at the Stadium of Light to help the club deal with the 
financial repercussions of going down.

However,
 given the size of the wage decrease, Sunderland’s most sought after 
stars are likely to angle for moves away if they drop into the 
Championship.

December 1999

West Ham’s Manny Omoyinmi (below) came on as a 113th-minute substitute of the League Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa, which the Hammers won on penalties. Omoyinmi had already played in the competition while on loan at Gillingham and the tie was rearranged. Villa won the second match 3-1.

May 2010

Hartlepool were deducted three points and received a suspended £10,000 fine after playing Gary Liddle in a 2-0 win over Brighton. Liddle should have been serving a suspension after picking up 10 bookings.

April 2011

Hereford and Torquay were both docked points for fielding ineligible players in the same League Two match. Hereford won 3-1, with their ineligible player scoring once, and were deducted three points and fined £10,000. Torquay lost a point and were fined £7,500. 

February 2012

Tottenham were kicked out of the NextGen youth series after fielding an ineligible player and Liverpool took their place.

December 2013

Birmingham withdrew from the Under 21 Premier League Cup after on-loan Aaron Mclean (pictured below with Hull City) scored twice as they beat Newcastle to move into the last 16. But Mclean had played for his parent club Hull in the second qualifying round.

PS. Sunderland were the first league club to be deducted points. In 1890, goalkeeper John ‘Ned’ Doig played for them but his registration had not met the seven day notice required.
