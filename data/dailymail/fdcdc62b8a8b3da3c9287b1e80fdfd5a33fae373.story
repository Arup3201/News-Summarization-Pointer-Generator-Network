Bill Cosby stood up to hecklers at a performance in Baltimore on Friday night.

At one point during the show a man stood up and yelled; '38 women spoke up and called you a rapist. 38 women!'

As fans of Cosby screamed 'Shut up!' at the man, he quieted the audience and spoke directly to the protester.

'I am going to handle this the way I want it handled,' he said.

Bill Cosby's performance in Baltimore was filled with protesters and at least one heckler in the venue

During his show a man stood up and screamed; '38 women spoke up and called you a rapist. 38 women!' (Protesters from outside his Denver show earlier this year above)

'Just remain calm,' Cosby told the audience according to The Washington Post.

'We are here to enjoy my gift. We are not here to argue. Let those people speak. We will find them and ask them to leave.' 

A few minutes later, the man was located and escorted out of the 2,500-seat Modell Performing Arts Center, which was notably empty.

This as venues have stopped selling water during Cosby's performances, afraid someone may throw it at him during his set. 

One attendee said he only got tickets after a friend's wife refused to go following the recent allegations, and he was more there to see the hoopla surrounding the event than the actual show. 

This happened on the same day two more women (above with gloria Allred) came forward to say they were drugged and raped by Cosby

Outside the venue, over 30 protesters greeted guests as they went into the auditorium, along with two individuals who were there in support of Cosby.

'I have been sexually assaulted,' one of the supporters, Zeanyanna Johnson, told The Baltimore Sun.

'I know what it feels like. But the man hasn't been charged with a crime, and the man hasn't gone to court. The Bible says, "Judge not, lest you be judged."'

Earlier that day, two more women, Margie Shapiro and Sunni Welles, came forward to claim they were drugged and raped by Cosby as teenagers. 

Cosby has continued to maintain his innocence.
