A 21-year-old suspected bank robber was busted by the FBI after posting photos of himself on his Facebook page brandishing a submachine gun he allegedly used in a Michigan heist.

Jules Bahler, who calls himself 'King Romeo', posted the 'selfies' on March 5 with the accompanying caption, 'Bought my first house And chopper today … lifes great (sic).

That same day, according to an FBI affidavit, the Brooklyn native threatened staff at Chemical Bank branch in Bay City, Michigan, with the assault-style weapon and fled with about $7,000.

Authorities say they were able to match Bahler's face from his Facebook  pictures with images of the robber from surveillance footage, linking him to three robberies in Pontiac, Michigan.

Bahler is also accused of stealing $4,300 from Genisys Credit Union on February 26 and $4,000 from a Bank of America branch on March 4. 

The Smoking Gun reported that a day after the March 5 robbery, Sergeant Todd Hunt of the Oakland Sheriff's Office was tipped off about the suspect's Facebook page.The affidavit doesn't reveal where Hunt got his information. 

'Affiant looked at these photographs and observed that the individual depicted in the photographs appeared to be the same individual,' the affidavit states.

'Additionally, affiant had an agent from the FBI's Bay City Resident Agency look at the photographs and he indicated that the machine gun looked like the same gun used in the robbery of the Chemical Bank in Bay City.'

Police identified the weapon as a submachine gun.

FBI officials  and local sheriff’s deputies began staking out Bahler's South Astor St, Pontiac, home - which he recently purchased - on March 7. 

After Bahler emerged and drove off, the investigators stopped him, and said they found the machine gun in a duffel bag in the car.

Officials also said he confessed to the robberies.

He has been charged with bank robbery and carrying a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and is reportedly scheduled to face U.S. District Court in Detroit tomorrow.

Bahler, who joined Facebook on February 5, has 206 friends, some of whom claim an affiliation with the Latin Kings street gang.

On March 4, he posted a picture of a home in Pontiac which he claimed he just purchased.

Before his arrest, a friend tried to warn him about the selfie, 'U tripping brotha, a friend wrote on Bahler’s Facebook page. I wouldn’t show that sh– off like that cops be watching this sh– brotha.'
