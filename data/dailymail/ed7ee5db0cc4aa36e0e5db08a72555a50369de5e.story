There was a moment of disbelief when it dawned on Ina Mills that she and her family had become victims of fraud.

She had put a $9000 engagement ring up for sale in a bid to raise funds for her sick son's urgent medical treatment.

So when a potential buyer came by their family home to meet 19-month-old Roki, who was born with brain damage and cerebral palsy, Mrs Mills had every faith the woman had made an honest purchase of the antique diamond ruby ring.

But Mrs Mills says the funds never came through.

This not only shocked the family from Newport, northern Sydney, but also the wider community as they raised more than $11,000 for Roki.

Since the incident on Australia Day, police arrested and charged a 25-year-old woman in Liverpool - southwest Sydney - on Thursday for the alleged fraudulent purchase of the handmade ring.

Mrs Mills placed the details of the sale in an online advert on Gumtree on December 21 and received expressions of interest from a woman by the name of Tanya. 

'The ring had been given to us by my husband Dave's aunt as it was valued at about $9000 and she wanted us to sell it,' the mother-of two told Daily Mail Australia.

'But it was quite a unique ring so we put it up for sale for $7000 but we really didn't receive any interest for it until this woman called Tanya got in touch with us on Australia Day.'

The woman was invited to Mrs Mills' home on January 26, where she met little Roki and his two-year-old sister Ruby.

'She tried on the ring and said that she'll have to get it re-sized because it was too small,' Mrs Mills said.

'She then said she'll do a bank transfer on the spot from her phone and showed me what looked like a legitimate bank receipt.

'I didn't suspect anything at all and I thanked her for helping us because the last 19 months have been very hard for us.

'I told her that her money was really going to help Roki and she also told us that he'll get better.' 

But three days had passed and there were no signs of the funds.

'I was positive that the money was going to come in but I got this sinking feeling when I tried calling the woman and her phone was disconnected,' Mrs Mills said.

'I just couldn't sleep for three days because this woman had stolen from Roki.' 

Roki had to be resuscitated soon after his birth due to some complications and suffered brain damage

Mrs Mills and husband David had planned for he proceeds from the ring to go towards Roki's third and hopefully final stem cell treatment in India next month.

He began his therapy at six-months-old at Nu Tech Medi World and Mrs Mills said 'the results have been amazing'.

'After his first treatment early last year his muscle spasm completely disappeared,' she said.

'We just wanted to get him out of pain so this was a great result for us.

'Then he started to move his right and left arm and considering he was diagnosed with quadriplegic cerebral palsy we were amazed.

'After his second treatment in October he started lifting his head up on his own - something he's never done before.'

But each trip to India comes at a price - $40,000 for the flights, accommodation and Roki's treatment.

Despite the cruel act of deceit, donations began flowing in for Roki - named after the 'rocky start' he had from the moment he was born.

'We were completely swamped by good will after our faith in humanity was destroyed,' Mrs Mills said. 

Even media personalities were touched by Roki's story as one of the hosts of 2GB radio Ben Fordham helped raised $11,000 for the 19-month-old.

'I've got the most generous listeners in Australia,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'When they heard about some lowlife stealing from a lovely family they jumped in to help. 

'One of my listeners threw in a hundred, another two hundred, five hundred, a grand, two and a half grand and before you knew it we had raised enough money to cover the theft.'

Mrs Mills shared Roki's heart-breaking story on his website, detailing how her newborn son had to be resuscitated soon after his birth due to some complications and suffered brain damage. 

He was then kept in hospital for six weeks, undergoing MRI scans and other tests, where doctors discovered his reactions and development 'proved to be more severe than predicted'.

'We were told that he may not talk, suck, eat, walk or see,' Mrs Mills wrote.

'But we continued to believe that he may and we still do. We could cope with all the bad news but the hardest thing remains the daily pain and discomfort he suffers from his severe muscle spasms.

'Roki's daily life is not easy. He is on very strong medications to help with the pain and control of his muscle spasms.' 

Mrs Mills posted a photo of her son thanking the community for their generous donations 

Roki's family remain hopeful that he will one day get better through his stem cell treatments

Days after the  incident on Australia Day, police charged a 25-year-old woman in relation to the alleged fraudulent purchase of Mrs Mills' ring.

She was taken to Liverpool Police Station on Thursday and charged with three counts of obtain benefit by deception.

She was granted bail and will face Liverpool Local Court on March 4.

In a separate matter, when the woman was released, she was allegedly recognised by a man who had attended the station to report a fraud. 

Police then re-arrested the woman near the police station where they spoke to her about the new allegations before releasing her pending further investigations.

'I just don't know how that woman could have seen the state of Roki and walked out of our home with the ring,' Mrs Mills said.

'But I think Roki is a little hero for catching someone who is abusing other people's trust.

'I hope Roki will one day return the help that he's received because he will get better. We will remain relentless in finding a cure for our son.'

The ring is yet to be recovered.
