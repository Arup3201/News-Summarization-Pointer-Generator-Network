A convicted drug dealer has been charged with murdering a Hollywood studio executive whose remains were found in the desert last fall, nearly two years after his disappearance.

John Lenzie Creech, 42, was charged Thursday with 57-year-old Gavin Smith's death, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.

Smith, who was married with three children, was last seen leaving a female friend's home in Ventura County's Oak Park neighborhood May 1, 2012.

Hikers discovered the remains about 70 miles away, near Palmdale in rural Antelope Valley, on October 26, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

Authorities said earlier they had found Smith's black 2000 Mercedes-Benz at a Simi Valley storage facility nine months after his disappearance. Its condition along with witness statements led them to believe Smith was killed. 

Investigators found Smith's blood and body tissue, including skin stuck to the car's seat.

He was declared dead in May of 2014 and a death certificate was issued for him, even though no remains had been found. 

In November, police said a skull and other bones found by hikers in a shallow grave in the desert east of Los Angeles had been identified as belonging to Smith. Authorities have not said how Smith was killed. 

Creech has been a longtime person of interest in the Sheriff's Department investigation.

The storage facility where Smith's car was found was linked to Creech, who is serving an eight-year jail sentence after pleading no contest to one count of transportation for sale of a controlled substance in September 2012.

A law enforcement official previously told the Associated Press that Smith was believed to have had a romantic relationship with Creech's wife, Chandrika, after meeting her in drug rehabilitation in 2009. 

Smith was with Fox's movie distribution department for nearly 18 years and was a branch manager for several theaters. He was also known for playing on UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team.

Creech is scheduled to be arraigned on the new felony charge Monday. If convicted, he faces 25 years to life in state prison. 

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said in November that hikers stumbled across human remains in the area of the Angeles National Forest on October 26, KTLA5 reported.

They were later identified as the 57-year-old husband and father of three sons. A cause of death has not yet been determined, as autopsy results were not finasalizedNishida said.

Smith was last seen in May in Ventura County in Los Angeles after leaving a friend's home.

His wife, Lisa, reported him missing the following day when he failed to pick up their eldest son, Evan, to take him to school, as he had promised to do.

In March last year, police found Smith's black Mercedes Benz 420E at a Simi Valley storage facility that belonged to John Creech.

At the time he disappeared, Smith was reportedly having an affair with John Creech's wife, Chandrika Creech, whom he met in drug rehab. John Creech is currently in prison on unrelated drug charges. 

Frustrated police said that while they had a number of leads in the investigation, they did not have enough evidence to lay charges and the absence of a body was a significant hole in the case.

Two years after going missing, in May 2014, a death certificate was issued for Smith, with the death officially recorded as May 1, 2012 - the day he disappeared.

Revelations about Smith's double life, which played out in the public eye after his disappearnce, was devastating to his wife and three sons Dylan, Evan and Austin.

Shortly after he disappeared, Lisa Smith told MailOnline last year that she felt instinctively that something bad had happened to her husband.

'I think he was murdered,' she said in the interview. 'And I am terrified that whoever did it is going to come after me and our boys.'

She said she believed her husband was in the grip of a mid-life crisis that involved drugs and sex with at least three women.

Gavin earned $180,000 a year at Fox, distributing hit movies including the Star Wars and Terminator series, Avatar and Titanic. But the couple were struggling to maintain their lavish Hollywood lifestyle and pay the mortgage on their three-bedroom home in the Los Angeles suburb of West Hills.

Lisa, an accountant who supported her husband during the early years of their marriage while he struggled as a bit-part actor, discovered he had taken money from his pension fund and squandered his year-end Fox bonus.

She also discovered he had a second mistress, named Melanie, in addition to Mrs Chandrika Creech, and he was apparently setting up a home for her and her family.

It was then - two weeks before he disappeared - that Lisa Smith threw her husband out of the house.

Mrs Smith, in the MailOnline interview, said her husband appeared to be in the grip of a mid-life crisis in the time leading up to his disappearance, talking about buying new cars for his sons and dressing to impress women.

'In hindsight, all the signs were there. He was dressing like a 20-year-old to go to drug rehab meetings and working out like mad,' she said.

She said Fox stopped paying her husband's salary two months after he disappeared and cleared out his office. Staff left several cardboard boxes of personal items, including framed family photos and golf trophies, on Lisa’s front porch.

May 9, 2012: Gavin's family and friends launch findgavinsmith.com in an effort to get any information about his whereabouts.

June 5, 2012: Sheriff's Department homicide detectives and family members hold a press conference asking for the public's assistance with any information as to Smith's whereabouts.

June 8, 2012: Homicide detectives, along with a canine unit and crime lab analysts, execute a search warrant at a residence in the San Fernando Valley district of Canoga Park. Local media report that police now suspect foul play in Smith's disappearance.
