Lewis Hamilton cemented his status as one of the brightest grand prix stars to emerge from these isles after equalling a long-standing record posted by arguably Britain's finest ever driver.   

In securing his 33rd career pole during Saturday's rain-hit qualifying session for the Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton matched the great Jim Clark's British record.

It is a tally that has stood for almost half-a-century, with Clark claiming the final pole of his career in his final grand prix appearance at the 1968 season opener in South Africa. The Scot was killed in a devastating Formula Two crash at Hockenheim only three months later.

Back-to-back: Lewis Hamilton matched Jim Clark's record after secyuring his 33rd career pole in Malaysia

In black and white: Clark won the 1963 and 1965 Formula One titles

Clark reached 33 poles in just 73 appearances during a career in which he won two world titles. It took Hamilton 131 races to reach the landmark.

The 29-year-old racer is now fourth on the all-time list with only Sebastian Vettel (45), Ayrton Senna (65) and Michael Schumacher (68) ahead of him.

A furious Daniel Ricciardo vowed to 'have a word' with Valterri Bottas after accusing the Williams man – in no uncertain terms – of blocking him during qualifying.

Ricciardo, who was disqualified from the season opener in Australia following a fuel-sensor issue, roared over the team radio: 'get this f****** Williams out of my way'.

The Aussie's foul-mouthed rant goes against his rather pleasant off-track demeanour where we have become accustomed to seeing him boast the widest smile in the sport.

But the race stewards were quick to side with the Red Bull driver dishing out a three-place gird penalty for Bottas who will subsequently start in a lowly 18th.

It is the Finn's second penalty points of the year. Ten more over the next year will result in a one-race ban.

Dreamy: Hamilton posted this picture after qualifying

Drivers are being forced to keep their weight down to an absolute minimum following the overhaul in regulations this season.

Before jetting to Australia, Jenson Button told MailOnline that he will visit a sauna before each qualifying session, while Nico Rosberg wrote in his column for this website that he has been forced to cut out all sugars from his diet.

And his team-mate Hamilton summed up the mood after qualifying when he posted a picture staring at a container full of biscuits before writing 'If only…'

On a more serious note, Martin Brundle claimed during his commentary for Sky Sports, that a driver, who he didn't wish to name, fainted at a PR event last week directly as a result of his enforced diet.

Next year the weight limit will be increased, but in light of such alarming stories, perhaps there should be a serious case to change the ruling this season.

Incredibly Sebastian Vettel was only 0.055seconds away from stopping Hamilton from clinching pole.

Mercedes have looked very strong all weekend – they were one second-a-lap quicker than the rest of the field in final practice. But to his and Red Bull's credit - albeit in damp conditions, Vettel managed to split the duo during qualifying.

Even the four-time world champion appeared surprised by the miniscule margin separating he and his rival, giving Hamilton a playful shove in parc ferme after seeing their respective lap times.

Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch enjoyed somewhat of a paddock tour on Saturday popping up in the Williams, Ferrari and Mercedes garages just minutes before qualifying.

The British actor was a big hit with the drivers, too, sharing time with Felipe Massa and Nico Rosberg.

Former AC Milan and Chelsea star Ruud Gullit was also seen in the Ferrari garage while Button's fiancée Jessica Michibata donned the Italian team's colours as she watched her future husband qualify 10th after his gamble to take to the track on intermediate tyres backfired.
