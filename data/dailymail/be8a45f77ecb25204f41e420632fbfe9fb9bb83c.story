The internet lit up with buzz about Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson starting Friday over claims the forward had been too forward with a female sideline reporter.

At the close of a pregame sideline interview, Thompson planted an impromptu kiss on Allie Clifton then quickly walked out of camera frame.

Clifton brushed it off and finished her segment, but some media outlets have since condemned Thompson's behavior as unsportsmanlike and much worse.

Smile and a wink: At the close of a pregame interview on Friday, Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson got awfully forward with the sideline reporter

The forward forward: Thompson caused a stir when he kissed sideline interviewer Allie Clifton

Thompson ended the interview by 'disgusting us as much as humanly possible,' wrote Yahoo sports writer Kelly Dwyer, 'There should be no marginalizing or rationalizing of this. That could be a mortifying thing for this reporter.'

Thompson, who went on to help lead the Cavs to a 108-103 victory against the Mavericks, started out the interview innocently enough.

He grinned sheepishly several times before calling Clifton by the wrong name as he answered one of her questions.

'See ball, get ball. Same approach. You know how I do it, Tina,' he said.

A little rattled: Clifton finished up her segment with a red face, but managed to sign off with her dignity intact

 Then came a wink and then the now-infamous smooch before Thompson left the camera frame.

Clifton's face reddened noticeably as she signed off with a joke.

'He also said he goes off the feel of the game, just like he does with interviews I guess,' said the shocked reporter.

But, just as soon as the backlash against Thompson began, Clifton herself put a stop it.

She tweeted on Monday about as much of an explanation for Thompson's behavior as we're likely to get any time soon:

'Hey fans @RealTristan13 thing was inside joke & not a big deal. We have a good working relationship. All is good.'

Inside joke? Clifton tweeted what will have to suffice to viewers as an explanation
