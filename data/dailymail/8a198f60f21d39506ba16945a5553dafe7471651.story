Arriving just in time for the bank  holiday, the blue skies and brilliant sunshine felt too good to last.

Now after the warmest day of the year, forecasters are predicting thundery showers and gales will set the tone for the rest of the month.

Yesterday was the hottest day of 2013 so far, with temperatures reaching a high of 24c (75.2f) in Crosby, Merseyside.

Relaxing: Along with large parts of the UK today, Bath in Somerset was also treated to warm weather. Rowena and her dog Missy enjoy the glorious sunshine

Much of Britain saw continued good weather, with temperatures higher than 22c in West Yorkshire,  Surrey, Lancashire and Wales.

Today, however, any thoughts of summer coming early will quickly be put to rest.

A cold front will bring the warm 
spell to a sudden end with thunder, lightning and heavy rain expected 
across the country. The South West will see the worst of the weather, 
with up to 0.8inches of rain.

The rest of the country will get between 0.2inches and 0.4inches, with the chance of thunder in  the North and the Midlands.

Dan  Williams of the Met Office said: ‘After the nice weather, things are going to change in the next few days.’

Forecasters expect temperatures to plummet by up to 10c, with highs of just 14c by the end of the week.

Gale force winds will hit Wales, 
south-west England and parts of the South East on Thursday, with gusts 
up to 70mph along the coast and 50mph inland making the drop in 
temperatures feel even sharper.

Mr Williams added: ‘Winds are going 
to be strong for this time of year. There is a severe weather warning 
for the South West because the winds may cause damage to trees and 
transport disruption.

Bright: The glorious warm weather has continued today following on from the warm conditions over the weekend. This image shows a boat leaving Ross Rowing Club in Ross on Wye, Herefordshire, today

Glorious: This crew onboard this boat in Ross on Wye are no doubt enjoying the hot weather. But conditions are set to deteriorate tomorrow

‘As a band of rain sweeps the  
country on Wednesday, most places will see some rain. It will leave 
behind cloudy weather with further showers possible.’

The unsettled weather will spread across the UK over the weekend, but the high winds are set to ease.

Looking further ahead, the Met Office
expects the second half of the month to be cooler than usual, with a 
chance of frosts at night.

The short-lived top temperature 
yesterday made Britain hotter than the party island of Ibiza in the  
Balearics. It was only just higher than the previous high of 23.1c set 
on April 25 in Faversham, Kent.

Forecaster Lindsey Mears from the Met Office said yesterday : 'The hottest place in the country today was Charlwood in Surrey, were temperatures got up to 23.2C.

'That just beating the previous record of 23.2C which was in Kent on April 25.

'We have been lucky with the high 
pressure across the country which has caused this lovely weather over 
the last couple of days, but sadly it is going to get quite unsettled 
over the next few days.

'Tomorrow will be much cooler down to on average 14-15C. It will be cloudy with rain expected.

'That rain could even turn to thunder in the north and Midlands.

'Towards the end of the week strong 
winds of up 50mph are expected, with coastal towns in the West of the 
country worst affected.

'There will also be scattered rain showers in the south, with the chance of thunder in the Midlands and the north.'

Mrs Mears added: 'That wind will be 
strong as the week progresses. We are looking at up to 50mph by the 
coast, perhaps even stronger.

'There will still be some rain but it will only be showers so nothing to much to worry about.

'It is expected to remain unsettled as we get into the weekend and beyond.'

Britons enjoyed basking in the 
sunshine yesterday as temperatures soared to 22.2C.

England and Wales were yesterday warmer 
than many traditionally sunny European countries including the Med and 
Venice in Italy as temperatures peaked at 22.2C in central London.

There was a marked difference between
the warmest and coldest places in Britain yesterday, as Stornoway in the 
North West of Scotland reached a peek of only 9.5C.

Britons flocked to beaches around the country to make the most of the blistering heat, but many found themselves suddenly shrouded in a bizarre fog.

Brighton may have been packed with sun worshipers but the temperature cooled when warm air moving in over cold sea water covered the beach with a thick sea mist.

The
rare sea fog left many sun-seekers in Bournemouth and Sussex struggling
to even see a few metres in front of them, let alone soak up any sun, 
after a clear sky was quickly replaced with thick mist moving in off the
ocean. 

The weather 
phenomenon is caused by warm air passing over the chilly sea water, 
which is much cooler than normal after the cold weather in March, and 
turning into mist.

The
sea mist, which slowly edged eastwards along England's coastline 
throughout the day, kept the temperature down until it gradually began 
to clear and the sun broke through.

The
mist developed along the south coast overnight, and was gone in the 
East by mid day but there is still fog in the west between Dorset and 
Cornwall.
