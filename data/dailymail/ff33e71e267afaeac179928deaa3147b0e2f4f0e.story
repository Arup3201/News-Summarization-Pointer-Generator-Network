A rally attended by thousands of students protesting against the tuition fee hike, unemployment and debt was abandoned today after a union leader was heckled and pelted with eggs and a satsuma.

Students from across Britain took part in the central London demonstration, despite the pouring rain - but after a mostly-peaceful march, a rally in south London was called off in farcical circumstances.

A small number of activists disrupted the rally as it began, with chants of ‘NUS, shame on you’ heard.

National Union of Students (NUS) president Liam Burns appeared on stage in an attempt to quieten parts of the crowd. Mr Burns later returned to address the rally, but was pelted with food.

The demonstration ended in farce shortly after 3pm, when around 20 protesters then broke through the barriers and stormed the stage, forcing Mr Burns to leave.

One of the protesters, a bearded man wearing a black waterproof jacket and cap, grabbed the mike and attempted to address the crowd, but the mike was cut.

Earlier the NUS estimated 10,000 people had set off from Temple London Underground station, marched along the Embankment, past Parliament to Kennington Park, south of the Thames.

There had been brief scuffles at 
Parliament as a minority of protesters rushed towards police protecting 
Portcullis House, but otherwise the march had passed without incident.

The
group marched from Parliament to Kennington Park, as it started to rain
heavily. Some sang: ‘It's cold, it's wet, and we're in loads of debt.’

As speakers, introduced by comedian Josie Long, took to the stage, a small group of protesters approached the front chanting: ‘NUS, shame on you, where the f**k you brought us to’.

'I've got a message for some of you here today. When people say that we are not united in picking the right fights, fighting the real enemies in Government rather than among ourselves - well, witness it here'

Their chants drowned out applause for the speakers, prompting Mr Burns to attempt to quell the dissent. ‘I've got a message for some of you here today’, he said, to a chorus of boos.

‘When people say that we are not 
united in picking the right fights, fighting the real enemies in 
Government rather than among ourselves - well, witness it here.

‘I'm
going to stand here and listen to the progressive campaigners in our 
movement and ignore these people. I invite you to join me.’

The
rally re-started but the disruption continued until Mr Burns returned 
to the stage to deliver his speech. Demonstrators then stormed the stage
and others tried to join them but were held back.

One protester was pinned to the stage by a security guard, who appeared to call into his radio for backup.

After the sound was cut the protesters 
milled around on stage for a few minutes before leaving, saying they 
were marching back to Parliament. The rally disbanded soon after.

'There is a lot of widespread and long-standing discontent with the NUS. It just produces politicians who go straight into a career with the Labour Party'

Ben, a 22-year-old student at University College London, who did not give his full name, said: ‘There is a lot of widespread and long-standing discontent with the NUS.

‘It just produces politicians who go straight into a career with the Labour Party. Every time we've needed a stronger union that battles for free education they have actually let us down.’

He added that protesters handed out more than 1,500 anti-NUS pamphlets and marched with a banner which included the words ‘smash the NUS’.
