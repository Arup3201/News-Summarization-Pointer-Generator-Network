Invasive probes into borrowers' finances and a potential end to short-term mortgage deals has been ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority, its head Martin Wheatley pictured

A massive crackdown on mortgages will come into force next week, with borrowers facing a forensic probe into their personal finances.

Cheap, short-term, fixed-rate deals could also be scrapped in a bid to ensure the irresponsible lending that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis is not repeated.

The reforms, ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority, are expected to slow the growth in property prices at a time when experts believe the market is in danger of overheating.

Traditionally, people applying for a mortgage are asked for three months’ pay slips and recent bank statements.

But from Saturday they will  face ‘invasive’ questions about their finances and lifestyle, warned Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA – from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership.

The rules, which will hit everyone from first-time buyers to homeowners looking for a new loan, are likely to mean:

Speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, Mr Wheatley admitted the changes  would create some problems in the short term. ‘In reality is it going to be perfect on day one? Probably not,’ he said.

He added that while the new rules would deliver some benefits, there would also be ‘some things that we are going to have to think again about’.

Those wanting to move or remortgage in a hurry could face a much longer mortgage application process.

And families could miss out on buying 
their dream home as they wait for an interview slot with their lender. 
The interviews themselves could last up to three hours.

Asked if people were ready, or even aware of the changes, Mr Wheatley said: ‘If I’m honest, no.’

The
 reforms mean nobody will be allowed a mortgage unless the lender 
decides they will be able to afford it, even if interest rates rise 
sharply.

At present, nine in ten mortgage borrowers opt for a fixed-rate arrangement, such as a two-year fixed deal. From next week, such deals will be much harder to find. Mr Wheatley said the changes were likely to mean fewer ‘teaser’ rates.

For example, a family might be able to afford a mortgage when they are paying a rock-bottom, fixed rate of two per cent interest. But their loan becomes unaffordable when this deal ends, unless they can find another deal at an equally cheap rate, which might not always be possible.

Mr Wheatley said: ‘We have some concerns about those short-term teaser rates that suck people into something.  The question is: “Can you afford whatever it resets to at the end of that rate?”

Interest-only mortgages will virtually disappear under the new rules. The FCA head predicted there would be problems with the reforms in the short term

Lenders will have to ‘stress test’ all loans to check the borrower could still afford them if interest rates hit seven per cent.

At present, the average two-year fixed rate mortgage charges 2.37 per cent. For a family with a £100,000 loan, this means monthly repayments of £442.

If the rate was seven per cent, the monthly bill would balloon to £707, an increase of £265 a month or nearly 60 per cent. Mr Wheatley said the changes could affect house prices, which are currently rising by around ten per cent a year.

The FCA’s own analysis found if prices were set to rise by 34 per cent over the next eight years, the rate of growth would fall to 23 per cent as a result of the changes.

Cheaper interest-only mortgage deals, which allow people to pay only the interest on their loan and none of the capital, will virtually disappear.

Mr Wheatley admitted the rules, known as the Mortgage Market Review, mean these deals will become ‘a niche’.

Ray Boulger, senior technical manager of mortgage advisers John Charcol, said many of the questions lenders were being forced to ask were ‘just ridiculous’.

He said: ‘If the new rules were applied to car insurance, nobody under the age of 25 would be able to drive a car because they would be deemed too risky.’

Mr Boulger warned the new rules were ‘too black and white’ and had been designed for the ‘lowest common denominator’.
