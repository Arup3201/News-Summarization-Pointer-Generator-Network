Taking a ride: The five men took photos of the Thursday night trip around Bordeaux and posted them online - they have now gone viral.

'We went in and played with the animals. We ended up taking a llama with us,' one, called Matthieu, told BFM TV.

One
of the photos posted online shows Serge in the middle of the men as 
they pose for the snap in the street, while another shows him on a tram.

But the driver called the police and then men left Serge tied to a lamp-post, before escaping.

The men were arrested and they now face charges having already spent a few hours in jail.

More than 600,000 people signed a Facebook petition calling for the group not to face charges.

The eight-year-old beast was not injured and is now back at the circus, but the director of the circus will not let the matter lie, reported Metro.

He said: ‘The offence is too serious: a zebra nearly escaped from the cage. We had to run everywhere to catch it.’

The circus has also increased security around their animal enclosures to ensure the incident is not repeated. 

Serge is doing well and was back performing at the circus the same day.
