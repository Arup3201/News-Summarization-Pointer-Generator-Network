A Met Police spokesman said: 'Police notified the London Ambulance Service of a plain-clothed female police officer involved in collision with a car.

'The incident happened today, Thursday, 2 October, at Shepherds Bush Road, W6 at approximately 15:30hrs.

'The driver of the vehicle was stopped nearby. A 24-year-old man has been arrested for failing to stop and attempted murder. He is in custody pending further investigation.

'The injured officer is currently receiving medical attention at hospital for possible broken leg and concussion. She is in a stable condition.

'Officers are currently investigating the circumstances which led to the collision.' 

Witness Theresia Petersen 24, from Shoreditch, who was vising a friend in Hammersmith, said she saw the entire incident unfold and claimed an orange vehicle was involved in a police chase.

She told GetWestLondon: 'A police car came behind us with his blue lights on chasing an orange car. The orange car then mounted the pavement to avoid the squad car blocking its path.

'Officers were running on foot from outside the police station to try and stop the car from getting away. This female police officer then ran out into the road to block his only exit and he literally mowed her down.

Officers closed the road for some time while the incident was dealt with and police investigations carried out

Scotland Yard confirmed the 24-year-old suspect remained in custody this evening following the incident 

Met Police Sergeant Steve Gilbert took to Twitter this afternoon to inform his followers about the incident

'She went up onto his bonnet, flew into the air and then smashed her head against my car. She then landed in the road and she had her hands and arms over her head but then I think she passed out.

'The driver of the orange car literally just ran her over. He hit her at speed. It was just horrific. I hope to god she's ok.'

The Met Police said the force could not comment due to 'operational reasons' on whether the motorist was being pursued by police at the time of crash.

However, an officer posting updates on Twitter from the scene said the suspect was chased after the collision.

Sergeant Steve Gilbert said: ‘Shepherd’s Bush rd closed Serious accident Officer run down. Suspect chased & arrested (sic).'

He later added: 'Officer not serious although still receiving hospital treatment. Thanks for all the well wishes. I’ll pass them on! #getwellsoon (sic).'
