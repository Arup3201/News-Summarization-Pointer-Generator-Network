David Cameron today warned if Labour was put in the nation’s driving seat it would repeat the mistakes of the past and drive the economy ‘into the same wall’.

The Prime Minister took a swipe at the opposition, after Ed Balls suggested he would borrow more and reinstate the 50p tax rate for highest earners even if it brought in no extra money.

Mr Cameron warned increasing the tax rate from 45p may be ‘politically convenient’ but would be ‘very, very bad for our economy’.

Prime Minister David Cameron used a speech to the Federation of Small Business to warn increasing the top rate of tax would cost jobs

Shadow chancellor Mr Balls announced at the weekend that he would restore the 50p rate for earnings over £150,000 as part of an economic plan to balance the books, run a budget surplus and cut the national debt if Labour is returned to power in 2015.

He denied that the deficit left by Labour was a problem and e even boasted that if he had his time in power again he would have spent even more money in some areas.

Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4: ‘You saw what Ed Balls said yesterday, which as far as I can see was that if he had his time over again, he would probably spend even more.

‘I think these people who seem to have learnt absolutely nothing from what went wrong with our economy, that the problems were based on too much borrowing, too much spending, too much debt, and they’re really saying: “If you gave us the key to the car, we would drive  it in exactly the same way into exactly the same wall”.’

Mr Cameron later met small businesses including boat builder and restorer John Watson at Lots Ait Boatyard in Brentford, west London

Mr Cameron later told a conference of the Federation of Small Businesses in London that the Labour proposals may be ‘politically convenient’ but would be ‘very, very bad for our economy’.

‘We've cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p. I think it was the right step to take. I always knew it wouldn't be particularly popular but I thought it was the right thing to do because I want to take steps in this country that are going to encourage investment, going to encourage jobs, going to encourage growth, going to encourage business to invest more,’ said the PM.

The plan to increase the top rate of tax sparked a ferocious response from business leaders, with 24 warning in a letter to the Daily Telegraph it would ‘put the economic recovery at risk’ and cost jobs.

Mr Cameron added: ‘From all the reaction I've seen over the last 48 hours since Ed Balls and Labour made their announcement, it only confirms me in that view.

‘We've now got former Labour minister after former Labour minister alongside a huge number of people in business to say that putting up the top rate of tax would cost jobs, cost investment, it is an anti-business, anti-enterprise, anti-growth measure.

‘I would argue that, just as I think what George Osborne and I did was right for the economy but politically difficult,  Labour are now doing something that's politically convenient but is very, very bad for our economy’.

Mr Cameron warned Labour was putting political point-scoring ahead of what was good for the economy but Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls insisting taxing people earning more than £150,000 would help to bring down the deficit

However, increasing the rate of tax rate for the highest earners is hugely popular with voters.

Mr Balls told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine that the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne ‘know in their heart of hearts they can't justify a massive tax cut to the richest when everybody else is worse off and paying more tax’.

‘I think a fair approach to deficit reduction means those with the broadest shoulders need to bear their share of the burden,’ he said.

‘I don't think this is an anti-business move, I don't think it's bad for Britain. I think it is a fair way to get the deficit down.’

Asked if it was not already a fair share that the top 1 per cent of earners paid 29.8 per cent of all income tax, he said their proportion was so high ‘because people are earning huge amounts of money, and rightly so in some cases’.

The 50p rate had raised £10 billion more than expected, he said, and the subsequent cut to 45p had cost the Exchequer £3 billion and given top earners an average £10,000 tax cut.
