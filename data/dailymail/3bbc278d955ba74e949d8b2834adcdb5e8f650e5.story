David Cameron’s efforts to build a 'special partnership' with India were overshadowed today by questions over alleged corruption in a UK-based company’s contract to supply helicopters to the country’s airforce.

The allegations against AgustaWestland have made front-page news in Indian newspapers during Mr Cameron’s three-day visit, and Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh today used a joint press conference to raise 'very serious concerns' about possible ethical breaches.

Mr Singh asked for assistance from the UK authorities as Indian investigators look into the allegations.

Mr Cameron - who only yesterday praised Westland’s operations in Yeovil and insisted the allegations were a matter for Italian and Indian authorities, and not the UK - assured him that Britain will respond to any request for information.

India has suspended payments under the £480 million contract following Italy’s arrest on corruption and tax fraud charges of Giuseppe Orsi, the chairman and chief executive of AgustaWestland’s Italian parent-company Finmeccanica, as well as AgustaWestland chief executive Bruno Spagnolini.

At a joint press conference following talks in Hyderabad House, New Delhi, Mr Singh said he had conveyed to the Prime Minister 'our very serious concerns regarding allegations about unethical means used in securing the 2010 contract for AgustaWestland helicopters'.

The company had been given until February 22 to explain whether 'contractual conditions on unethical practices... have been violated', said the Indian PM.

And he added: 'I have sought full assistance from the UK in this case. Prime Minister David Cameron has assured me of the co-operation of his Government in the investigation.'

Mr Cameron said: 'We will respond to any request for information. I am glad that the Italian authorities are looking into this issue in detail, as Finmeccanica is an Italian company.'

Britain has some of the strongest anti-bribery legislation in the world and will 'root out any problems of bribery and corruption wherever and whenever they appear', Mr Cameron promised.

He later told the BBC that he shared Mr Singh’s concerns, saying: 'The defence trade, the defence industry, is an important industry for Britain and I want that to be a clean industry and a clean trade....

'Be in no doubt we absolutely condemn these sorts of practices.'

Finmeccanica said it had 'acted correctly throughout the 40 years it has operated in India'.

The statement went on: 'In addition, Finmeccanica underlines that its companies have operated for many years and continue to operate in India, with managerial and operational autonomy, complying fully with Indian Law and the ethics principles of the Group.'

Meanwhile more Indian students are to be encouraged to come to the UK with the offer of new scholarships to a top university, it was announced today.

The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) said it will be offering 50 scholarships for Indian postgraduates, starting this autumn.

The announcement comes the day after Prime Minister David Cameron used a visit to India to insist that there is 'no limit' on the number of Indians who can study at UK universities, or take up graduate-level jobs after qualifying.

The Prime Minister's trips to New York, Brazil and Afghanistan cost nearly £540,000, according to transparency data released today.

An Afghanistan visit in July cost £4,060 for travel and accommodation. But a four day trip, which started with a UN meeting in New York followed by Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia to drum up trade, cost £532,093.

The data also revealed that gifts to Mr Cameron between July and September included tickets to see Andy Murray's Wimbledon final, a silver model from Tory donor Sir Anthony Bamford, which he did not keep, and a vase from the King of Bahrain. Deputy PM Nick Clegg did not receive any gifts during that period. Ministers must declare all gifts over £140 and pay for those they wish to keep.

LSE said today its new India Scholarships will allow students to study for a Master's degree at the institution.

The awards will be worth between £3,000 and £32,000, depending on need, and are open to students with the offer of a place to study for a Master's at the LSE by April 30.

LSE director Professor Craig Calhoun, who is travelling with Mr Cameron in India, said: 'We want to ensure that LSE's doors are open to all talented students, regardless of financial circumstances, and are delighted to cement this relationship further by offering 50 scholarships, for graduate study, for students from India.'

Mr Cameron later had the unusual experience of being greeted by screams of adulation as he visited a college for girls in New Delhi.

However, the screams of around 500 teenage girls were directed not at the PM but at Bollywood film star Aamir Khan, who joined him to chat with students at the Janki Devi Memorial College.

The film heartthrob is also a Unicef ambassador for child nutrition and the patron of a women-only taxi service in the city.

Khan introduced Mr Cameron to some of the Sakha Cabs workers, who are trained in car mechanics and self-defence at the college.

Khan said the girls had mostly wanted to talk with Mr Cameron about women's rights issues in India and about their prospects of studying and working in the UK.

The Bollywood star told British reporters travelling with the PM: 'I was meeting him for the first time... It was very interesting to meet with him and understand what his plans are very broadly in terms of development work with the UN and Unicef.'

Khan said the younger generation in India no longer felt their views of the UK were coloured by its past as a colonial master.

'I for one feel that what happened in the past happened in the past,' he said. 'I don't think we can hold the present generation of Britishers responsible for something that happened ages ago. It's not fair and it's not something I would like to do.'

Asked if he found that Mr Cameron felt the need to apologise for Britain's colonial past, the actor said: 'No, no, no. I think he's a very positive kind of person. He came across as an extremely dynamic and positive person, and someone who is looking ahead.'

Khan said he did not think Mr Cameron had not seen any of his Bollywood films, but said the PM was interested in a TV series he did last year looking at social problems in India.

David Cameron has renewed speculation
about his tendency to ‘chillax’ on the job as he broke off his trade 
trip to India to play cricket yesterday.

The
Prime Minister began his visit with the biggest business delegation in 
history by revealing that he stays sane by having a good night’s sleep 
and employing good staff to do the work for him.

He also claimed he would be watching Bollywood films on the flight out.

Yesterday: The Prime Minister also laid a wreath at the memorial to commemorate the policemen who were killed in the terrorist attacks of November 2008, in Mumbai

The Indian leader stressed the importance of education, science and trade in enhancing relations between the two countries.

He said: 'I impressed upon the Prime Minister the need for a visa regime that facilitates greater movement of people between the two countries.'

In today’s talks, Mr Singh and Mr Cameron agreed closer co-operation between the UK and India over cyber-security, which is expected to see the establishment of a joint taskforce to share information on malicious IT attacks from criminal gangs, terrorists and state agents.
