Iran and world powers blamed each other today for the lack of progress in talks on Tehran's nuclear programme.

The stalemate has dimmed hopes of a breakthrough which it was hoped would avert the threat of a new Middle East war.

On the second and final day of talks in Moscow, frustration mounted over the failure to move any closer to ending a decade of negotiations over Iranian work.

If talks collapse, nerves could grow on financial markets over the danger of higher oil prices and new conflict in the Middle East.

Israel has previously threatened to bomb Iranian nuclear sites if diplomacy fails to stop Tehran getting the bomb.

An Iranian diplomat said: 'We did not come to Moscow only for discussions. We came to Moscow for a resolution. But we believe the opposite side is not ready to reach a resolution.'

Iran says its nuclear programme has only non-military purposes, but the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany want Tehran to stop enriching uranium to levels that bring it close to acquiring weapons-grade material.

Iran's negotiators want relief from 
economic sanctions and are pushing the six powers to acknowledge its 
right to enrich uranium, something they refuse to do until Tehran allows
United Nations inspections of its work.

A
spokesman for European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who
is leading the world powers' delegation, said Monday's talks had been 
intense and tough.

A Western diplomat made clear late on Monday Iran needed to do more to address proposals made by the six powers at the last round of talks.

The diplomat, who was at the talks, said: 'Our key requirements are: stop, shut and ship.'Â

He was referring to demands for Iran to stop producing higher-grade uranium, ship any stockpile out of the country and close down an underground enrichment facility, Fordow.

But an Iranian official said Tehran's delegation had made detailed proposals on the first day of talks and the six powers had responded with one-line answers that lacked any depth.

He said: 'Our feeling is that the agenda this group is following is not suitable for the arguments that Iran was making. We believe we are at a crossroads. And today the other side has to choose a path.'

Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who leads Russia's delegation at the talks, said diplomacy could still be salvaged.

Ryabkov said: 'I don't think anything will break down. We will have a reasonable outcome.'

The Moscow talks follow two rounds of negotiations since diplomacy resumed in April after a 15-month hiatus.

During the break in talks the West cranked up sanctions pressure and Israel repeated its threat to bomb Iranian nuclear sites if diplomacy failed.

A second Western diplomat said: 'We haven't reached an agreement, but it is more complex than that. We haven't got to the end of the conversation.'

A series of United Nations Security Council resolutions since 2006 have demanded Iran suspend all its enrichment-related activities.

Tehran denies planning to build nuclear weapons and says its programme is purely for civilian purposes.

Rather than halt enrichment - a process which refines uranium for use as fuel or, if done to a much higher level, nuclear bomb material - Iran has increased its activities.

Experts said a breakthrough was unlikely as the six powers involved are wary of making concessions that would let Tehran draw out the talks and gain the time needed to develop nuclear weapons.

An EU embargo on Iranian oil takes full effect on July 1 and new U.S. financial sanctions shortly before that.

Iran's crude oil exports have fallen by some 40 percent this year, according to the International Energy Agency.

Increasing the pressure, is Israel - believed to be the only nuclear-armed country in the Middle East - has said time is running out before Iran's nuclear facilities, some of which are deep underground, become invulnerable to air strikes.

Western diplomats said one positive sign to emerge from Monday's talks was that Tehran was willing to discuss higher-grade uranium, the international community's most pressing concern.

In early 2010, Iran announced it had started enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, a level much higher than what is needed for power generation and seen by some experts as a dangerous step towards being able to make bomb material.

The six powers want a substantive response to their offer of fuel supplies for Tehran's research reactor and relief in sanctions on the sale of commercial aircraft parts to Iran.

Diplomats said the powers had also suggested, at a meeting in Baghdad in May, that they suspend introducing new sanctions at the United Nations level while diplomacy is taking place, but only if their demands on high-grade uranium are met.

Displaying unity after meeting on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Mexico on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama again called for Tehran to prove its nuclear programme is not aimed at developing weapons.

Obama said the two leaders agreed on the need for a diplomatic solution to the standoff and that there was still time to resolve the matter through diplomatic means.
