After adding superstar running back LeSean McCoy to his roster, new head coach Rex Ryan looks to have found a new quarterback for the Buffalo Bills.

Matt Cassel will join next week from the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for draft picks.

The Bills will trade their sixth round pick for a fifth round pick in May's draft as well as a seventh round pick in 2016. 

The 32-year-old played the first three games of last season before a broken foot suffered in the defeat at New Orleans ended his season. Teddy Bridgewater, the Pepsi Rookie of the Year, took over under center and Cassel has opted to play elsewhere.

Due $4.15million this year - including a $500,000 roster bonus - Cassel has a year left on his two-year, $10 million deal he signed with Minnesota last March.

Cassel, who was drafted by the New England Patriots in 2005, has also played for the Kansas City Chiefs and has a 33-38 record as starter during his 10-year NFL career.

Cassel and the Bills travel to London in Week 7, where they will play the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25. Cassel has experience of playing London as he led the Vikings to a 34-27 win over Pittsburgh in 2012.
