Nemanja Vidic has insisted the Manchester United players did not dislike David Moyes but instead fought among themselves.

The 2012-13 Premier League champions endured a frustrating season, eventually finishing in seventh place after Moyes' sacking.

And Vidic, who is leaving Old Trafford after eight years, admits there were clashes between United players.

'We argued among ourselves,' said Vidic, speaking in an interview with the Telegraph's Mark Ogden.

'This year more than any other, because when you have bad times, people show they care. We are still friends, but we were arguing to get better. We wanted to improve.'

Moyes was relieved of his duties in last month, replaced by club legend Ryan Giggs as caretaker boss.

The 40-year-old was in charge of only four games, winning his first 4-0, and Vidic revealed that the players felt more 'comfortable' under the player/manager.

'I am not saying that the David Moyes way was bad, but these players feel more comfortable playing a certain way of football.

'Ryan [Giggs] shares the same ideas as Sir Alex Ferguson and his was a more similar approach to the one we had with Sir Alex. The players are more used to it and felt more comfortable with it.

'The best answer I can say is that he [Moyes] tried really hard, he was professional.

'He was really committed to the job and desperately wanted to do well. But unfortunately, it didn’t happen and we are all sad.'

Vidic is joining Inter Milan this summer, penning a two-year contract at the Serie A club.
