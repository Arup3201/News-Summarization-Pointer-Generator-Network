World champion junior cyclist Macey Stewart has been injured in a hit and run crash while training in her home state of Tasmania.

The 18-year-old was travelling through east Devonport in the state's northwest about 2pm on Thursday when she was hit by a car outside a hotel, police say.

The teen was hit from the back as she cycled home alone. 

‘Had my first green whistle (happy gas) experience today.. I am very lucky to be alive after being hit by a car’ Macey Stewart said on her Instagram post

The impact threw Stewart to the ground, knocking the motorist's side rear vision mirror off it's hinges.

According to reports, the motorist stopped to pick up his mirror and immediately left the scene.  

In a post on Instagram, Ms Stewart said she was lucky to be alive after she managed to walk away with only minor grazes and bruising. 

The world champion was riding her bike solo when the accident happened

'Had my first green whistle (happy gas) experience today.' she said in her post.

'I am very lucky to be alive after being hit by a car (and nearly a truck) while out training today.. The driver did a runner, after stopping to pick up his mirror that I had broken off while I scrambled to the side of the road to avoid being hit by the oncoming truck.' she continued.

'Fortunately my bones are still in tact and I just have some skin off and am very sore! 

'Definitely not ideal when heading to Adelaide for a training camp tomorrow morning! Lucky I'm a tough cookie and plan to be back on the bike tomorrow!'

She finished off her post by warning other cyclists of the dangers of the open road.

The incident comes just a month after Stewart won gold in the women's junior individual time trial world championships in Spain.

'Be careful on the roads guys, there are some crazy people out there!' Ms Stewart said.

She was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries before being released.

Speaking to The Advocate, the rising star said she would not let the accident stop her from riding her bike. 

'I'm a bit sore and that sort of thing, but I plan on getting back on the bike tomorrow,' she said.

'It is a bit frightening knowing that this type of thing is happening more and more these days.

'I'm not deterred from riding: I love it too much and have big goals to achieve.'

The incident comes just a month after Stewart won gold in the women's junior individual time trial world championships in Spain.

She posted a throwback picture to her Instagram account of the event last week, calling it one of the best days of her life.

'The vehicle that struck her stopped briefly at the scene, before leaving,' Tasmania Police said in a statement.

Investigators believe they have found the vehicle - described only as a dark-coloured sedan - responsible for the hit and run and are carrying out forensic tests.

Police want to speak to the driver of a truck who had to stop to avoid hitting Stewart after she had fallen.
