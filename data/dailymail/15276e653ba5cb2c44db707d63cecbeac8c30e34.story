As any chocoholic will attest, whether it's in a bar or melted into fondue, a hit of the sweet brown stuff can be difficult to resist.

And now chocolate lovers can take their addiction to a whole new level thanks to the chocolate shooter - a device that allows people to snort cocoa powder.

Based on old Victorian snuff shooters, the device was invented by Belgian chocolatier Dominique Persoone as a novel way to enjoy his favourite sweet treat.

Sweet sniff: Belgian chocolatier Dominique Persoone invented the chocolate shooter as a novel way to eat the sweet treat for a Rolling Stones party in 2007, but the idea has since caught on

Chocolate hit: Mr Persoone, 46, has spent a long time developing his own chocolate powder mix filled with ginger and mint after discovering that raw cocoa powder was too dry

Snort: The diner fills two spoons with the powder which is fixed to a trigger mechanism. A push of the lever then fires the chocolate up either nostril

He originally made the device for a Rolling Stones party in 2007, but  the concept has taken off and been used by culinary innovators such as Heston Blumenthal at his restaurant The Fat Duck.

Diners are given a special mix of Dominican Republic or Peruvian cocoa powder mixed with raspberry, ginger and mint to snort.

They pack the powder into two small spoons fixed to a trigger mechanism, then hold the device close to their nose and press the lever, sending it shooting up their nostrils.

The tattoo-clad 46-year-old said: 'The mint and the ginger really tinkle your nose. Then the mint flavour goes down and the chocolate stays in your brain.'

It has taken him years to develop the perfect snorting powder, as early experiments with pure cocoa powder revealed it was too dry.

Perfection: Before landing on his current mix, Mr Persoone was using a combination involving chili pepper, which he says was 'a very bad idea' in hindsight

Sexy: Mr Persoone says there is a 'kinky' appeal to snorting the chocolate, but denies that he is promoting drug use, saying the device is just a bit of fun

Novelty: The chocolate shooter sells for around 45 Euros (£30) and has been used by the likes of Heston Blumenthal at his restaurant The Fat Duck

Before he hit on the tingling sensation of mint and ginger, he was using a mix which contained chili.

'It's a very bad idea,' he said.

The chocolate shooters, which sell for 45 Euros (£30) each, have been exported to Russia, India, Canada, Australia and the United States.

The packaging bears a warning against excessive sniffing, but Persoone insists it is safe. He was inspired by the role of the nose when tasting food and, he says, a certain idea of fun.

He added: 'The mentality when you think about sniffing is: "Oh it's kinky, guys who do that stuff...'"

'I'm not the bad boy promoting drugs, not at all ... Life is boring. Let's have fun.'

Straight to the brain: Mr Persoone says the ginger and mint open the nasal passages and make the face tingle, while helping deliver a pure hit of cocoa
