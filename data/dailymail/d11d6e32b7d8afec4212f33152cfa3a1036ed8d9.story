James Rodriguez turned out to watch some volleyball as the Real Madrid forward caught his wife Daniela Ospina playing for Los Blancos in the Spanish capital.

Daniela Ospina proved James Rodriguez isn't the only one in their household with sporting prowess and still only 22, is a former beach volleyball international for Colombia. 

Rodriguez took his daughter along to the match having helped Real Madrid to a 2-1 win at Cordoba on Saturday to keep Carlo Ancelotti's side top of La Liga by one point from rivals Barcelona, with a game in hand.

Like her husband, Daniela wears the number 10 shirt for her club side and it should be no surprise of her sporting talent as she is the sister of Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina.

Rodriguez continues to impress at the Bernabeu this season, already scoring ten goals for Los Blancos in 30 appearances for the La Liga leaders. 

Having missed out on the FIFA FIFPro World XI at the Ballon d'Or awards, despite a magnificent World Cup in Brazil for Colombia last summer, he still left the ceremony with the FIFA Puskas Award for goal of the year after his sensational volley against Uruguay.
