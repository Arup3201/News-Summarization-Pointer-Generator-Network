Real Madrid head into Saturday's derby against Atletico Madrid with a depleted squad after James Rodriguez and Sergio Ramos suffered injuries on Wednesday night.

Carlo Ancelotti's side beat Sevilla 2-1 to maintain their four-point lead at the top of La Liga, but attention will now turn to the Madrid derby, for which Madrid look a few players short.

James Rodriguez and Sergio Ramos were both substituted inside 25 minutes of the game at the Bernabeu on Tuesday, with a statement later confirming that Rodriguez's injury is as bad as was initially feared.

'After the tests carried out on James Rodriguez by the Real Madrid medical services at the Sanitas La Moraleja Hospital', the statement reads, 'he has been diagnosed with a fracture of the fifth metatarsal in his right foot. The player will undergo surgery in the coming hours.'

Along with Ramos, who overstretched his hamstring going in for a challenge, and Marcelo, whose yellow card on Wednesday night leaves him suspended for one of Real's biggest games of the season, Ancelotti will have to turn to some fringe players to fill his first team.

Pepe is also a major doubt with injury, while Fabio Coentrao looks certain to be sidelined for the crunch clash.

Anything but three points for Madrid could see Barcelona close the gap at the top of La Liga to one point, if they pick up maximum points away at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday evening.
