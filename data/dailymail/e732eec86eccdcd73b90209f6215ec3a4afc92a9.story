Mesut Ozil's girlfriend Mandy Capristo has reportedly moved out of his London home just a week after the Arsenal star was accused of 'muscling in' on another woman - with a removal van pictured outside the house on Friday. 

Former Bayern Munich midfielder Christian Lell claimed Ozil was 'muscling in' on his relationship with ex-girlfriend Melanie Rickinger last week.

The Arsenal man is out until the end of 2014 with a knee ligament injury and he has reportedly been given a double blow with the news Capristo has moved her stuff out if his home.

Singer Capristo had been living with the player valued at £42million in west London and is a judge on the X Factor-style reality show 'Germany's Search for a Superstar'. 

It has been reported that Ozil exchanged intimate messages with model Rickinger on the messaging service WhatsApp.

Both Ozil and Capristo have refused to comment on the allegations.

However, according to The Sun, the singer's belongings were seen being taken into a removal van and she has reportedly told friends her relationship with the 26-year-old German World Cup winner is over after being left devastated.

The newspaper quotes a friend as saying: 'Mandy had a break from filming so came back to London to get her stuff.'

The allegations first came to light last week when Lell, who plays for Levante in Spain, gave an interview with German newspaper Bild and explained his ex Miss Rickinger had exchanged messages with Ozil and described her as a 'snake'.

The newspaper quotes Mr Lell as saying: 'Mesut exploited his fame, and muscled in on our relationship. That isn't OK'.

Ozil himself has refused to comment on the situation but his agent Rolan Eitel said: 'We are not commenting on this. We will keep an eye on the situation and take legal action if necessary.

Mr Lell's ex-girlfriend Rickinger has said her former boyfriend is 'crazy'.

She has not denied the accusations, but did insist that Lell had accessed her messages without her permission.

'I deleted everything on my phone. He must have gone on himself and backed everything up,' she said. 'He's completely crazy.'
