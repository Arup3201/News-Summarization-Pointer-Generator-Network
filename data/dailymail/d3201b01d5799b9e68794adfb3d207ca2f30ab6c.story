A manhunt has been launched for a wheelchair thief in New York who swipes women's handbags from right under the noses of their unsuspecting owners.

The crocked crook has left women across Manhattan too afraid to leave their purses unattended after he struck in some of the city's fanciest nightspots.

Dressed in violet from head to toe, the man has been captured on CCTV wheeling into hotels and nightclubs before pouncing while his victims look the other way. He is then seen free-wheeling off into the night, his ill-gotten gains tucked into his lap.

America's most violet criminal: Dressed in purple from head to toe, the man has been captured on CCTV wheeling into hotels and nightclubs before pouncing while his victims look the other way

And detectives have now said they are beginning to suspect that the opportunistic thief is not just using his wheelchair as a handy accessory... but is actually disabled.

'Every time we’ve seen him, he’s in the wheelchair,' a police source told the New York Daily News.

He first struck at 9.45pm on August 30 when he grabbed an expensive Coach purse a 34-year-old diner had placed under the bar.

Then, four days later, he was again caught on CCTV rolling off with a bag that a 40-year-old woman put on her chair when she decided to hit the dance floor of Havana Central bar in Times Square.

He later used her credit cards to buy pizza at a nearby takeaway restaurant, police said.

However, detectives also suspect the bandit may be behind the unsolved pilfer of a satchel bag, containing an iPhone, credit cards and jewellery, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel on Broadway on August 19.

That was after a 42-year-old woman reported her bag stolen while she chatted to the hotel concierge in the hotel lobby.

Police are asking anyone with information regarding this man’s 
whereabouts to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS. All calls will be 
kept confidential.
