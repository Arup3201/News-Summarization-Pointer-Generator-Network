Films and TV shows like The Hunger Games and the Walking Dead have inspired reckless amateur hunters to use bows and arrows to maim animals, many of whom take several days to die in agony.

The RSPCA says there has been a rise in the number of animals shot with arrows across Queensland over the past year.

Spokesman Michael Beatty suspects popular TV shows with hunting themes such as Hunger Games, the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones may have inspired some to to take up the sport. 

The most recent incident - a pelican spotted with an arrow in its side at Lake Tinaroo, inland from Cairns - was reported to police on Tuesday morning.

The main character in The Hunger Games trilogy Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is famously skilled with a bow and arrow, which she uses to hunt animals and defend herself in a fantasy game of life or death.

The TV series The Walking Dead also features characters using bow and arrows to kill post-apocalyptic, flesh-eating zombies.

Medieval drama series The Game of Thrones is also suspected of inspiring hunting amateurs.

At least 10 animals, including possums (pictured), magpies, wallabies, a kangaroo and even a horse, have been killed or maimed in Queensland in this way over the past year

'It has always gone on but seems to be more prevalent,' Mr Beatty said.

'They don't stop to think of the suffering that they're going to cause the animal.'

Unless a person is highly skilled, animals are often injured and left die in pain over a number of days. 

At least 10 animals, including possums, magpies, wallabies, a kangaroo and even a horse, have been killed or maimed in Queensland by arrows over the past year.

Most cases have been in the south east and there is generally a spike over the school holidays.

Mr Beatty said attempts are being made to find the wounded pelican.

'If we can get it in time it might survive,' he said.

In October two turkeys were put down after being shot with arrows in a horrifying incident at Carina Heights, south east of Brisbane.

RSPCA officers believe the animals would have suffered before being rescued and despite being treated at the local wildlife hospital, they had to be euthanised. 

An X-ray showed that the arrow had passed completely through the thorax of one of the turkeys, with its left lung likely to be affected.

There are no laws against hunting with a bow and arrow, but a person can be prosecuted if it can be proved the animal has suffered - a difficult task if the animal is dead, Mr Beatty says.

RSPCA NSW says it has also had several incidents in and around Sydney in the last few months.

There have been goats, pelicans, cats, and birds shot with arrows.
