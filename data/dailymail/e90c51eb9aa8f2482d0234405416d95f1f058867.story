Islamic militants have fired rockets from speedboats at Libya's largest port in an attempt to seize control of the fiercely contested resource amid warnings the country is descending into chaos like that in Syria.

Last night a rocket set three storage tanks ablaze at the eastern Libyan oil port of Al-Sidra as armed factions allied to competing governments fought over control of the country's biggest export terminal.

Rebels from a group called Libya Dawn, which helped to topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, seized control of the capital Tripoli in August - exiling the internationally recognised government east.

The group, which is responsible for the attack which left the tanks ablaze, are now engaged in a bitter power struggle with the incumbent government fought primarily over the country's resources.

Ali Hassi, spokesman for a security service allied to the country's east-based internationally-recognised government, said the rival force tried taking the Al-Sidra with speedboats, opening fire on an oil tank.

Ismail al-Shukri, a spokesman for the rival force, said it had launched a new push to take the ports but denied it had sent boats or shot at any storage tanks. He blamed the other side, saying aircraft had attacked the tank.

'A tank was hit but the damage is limited,' Hassi said, adding that the advance had been stopped with aircraft and ground troops.

Clashes were also reported from Sirte, a city west of Al-Sidra, killing up to 19, among them 14 guards at a power plant, residents said.

Meanwhile Libya, torn by the growing political divide that threatens to engulf its oilfields, could become the next Syria if it does not patch its divided government and get help battling Islamic militants, the country's foreign minister said this week.

'If we don't do the right thing now, in two years' time we could have - hopefully not - a repeat of what happened in Syria in 2014 because the international community didn't react adequately,' Foreign Minister Mohamed Dayri said.

In an ominous turn of events, a force allied to the self-declared Libya Dawn government earlier this month moved to seize Libya's two biggest oil export ports, Al-Sidra and Ras Lanuf. Fighting has since spread to a third oil port.

Dayri repeated his government's charge that forces attacking the oil facilities included elements of Ansar al-Sharia - a group the U.S. has designated as terrorists suspected of being involved in the deadly September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

The fighting has reduced Libya's crude output to 352,000 barrels a day, a spokesman for state National Oil Corp said, adding that only the Brega, Sarir, Messla and offshore operations were still producing.

Al-Sidra and Ras Lanuf ports - now closed due to the conflict - had previously been processing an estimated 300,000 barrels per day.

Commanders of armed groups operating in Libya have been warned they could face prosecution for possible war crimes including execution and torture.

The United Nations claims hundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting since late August, when Libya Dawn seized control of the capital Tripoli. 

The North African country is struggling with fighting on several fronts as brigades of former rebels who battled side by side to oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 now clash for political power and a share of oil revenues.

The conflict has driven at least 120,000 people from their homes and caused a humanitarian crisis, said a joint report by the U.N. human rights office and U.N. Support Mission in Libya  that also documents shelling of civilian areas.

The toll includes an estimated 100 people killed and 500 wounded in fighting between rival armed groups in Warshefana, an area near Tripoli 'perceived to be harbouring many Gaddafi supporters as well as common criminals', between late August and early October.

A further 170 were killed and hundreds injured in fighting in the Nafusa mountains to the southwest, it said.

Some 450 people have been killed in Benghazi since fighting escalated in mid-October. Hospitals there have been shelled or occupied by armed groups.

And since mid-October, the Libyan army and forces loyal to former general Khalifa Haftar have been waging a war to retake the eastern coastal city, held by Islamist groups.
