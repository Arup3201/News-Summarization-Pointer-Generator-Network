Fan's mother Xiao Cheng, 35, was stood just yards away with other relatives returning from the funeral as her son and mother were killed beneath the falling poles.

Distraught truck driver Li Hsiung, 31, was treated at the scene for shock. He said: 'There was nothing I could do. I tried to swerve to avoid the car but I lost the load.

'I've been driving for 12 years and I've never even had a scratch, and now this?'
