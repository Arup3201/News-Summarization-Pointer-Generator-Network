The Russian space agency Roscosmos is planning to travel to the moon - and stay there.

'We're not talking about repeating what mankind achieved 40 years ago,' said Vladimir Popovkin, head of Russian space agency Roscosmos. 'We're talking about establishing permanent bases.'

Roscosmos has already said that it aims to put a man on the moon by 2030.

The mission was revealed at the Global Space Exploration Conference - an international space conference at which neither America or China was present.

The Japanese space agency Jaxa also revealed that it was planning manned moon missions.

We are looking at the Moon as our next target for human exploration,” said Yuichi Yamaura, an associate executive director at JAXA.

An official statement from the conference said, 'The International Space Station has helped us learn a lot more about humans in space but we still have more to learn. Will private space entities eventually turn to a settlement and colonisation model going forward, and will this open up space settlement and colonisations in ways that were not thought of in previous decades?'

'We have produced and flown more hardware over the last 30 years than we will need for Mars, although the necessary technologies aren’t necessarily the same.  The key to success is austere programs that are properly led and focused.'

Roscosmos has had a rocky history so far, often announcing ambitious plans but not always succeeding at execution. In January, a faulty launch saw the country's Mars probe, the Fobos Grunt, crash down to Earth following an unstable two-month orbit.

Just last week, reports escaped from the agency that the head, Vladimir Popovkin, has been suffered head injuries following a fight in the office.

Russia and the U.S. fought neck-and-neck in the 60s, but Russia threw in the towel when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin reached the stars.

They closed down their moon programmes, but re-entered space in the spirit of international co-operation, and currently provides launches to and from the International Space Station.

But prime minister Vladimir Putin said last year that 'Russia should not limit itself to the role of an international space ferryman'.
