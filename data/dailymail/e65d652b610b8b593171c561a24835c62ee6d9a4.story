Horror: Judge Susan Criss has said she believes Robert Durst left a severed cat's head on her doorstep

A judge who oversaw the acquittal of Robert Durst in a murder trial says she believes the suspected killer left a severed cat's head on her doorstep.

Judge Susan Criss presided over Durst's trial in Texas when the real estate millionaire was acquitted of shooting and dismembering his neighbor in Galveston, Texas.

But now, she has said she believes the real estate millionaire is a 'serial killer' and that he killed his dogs to practice cutting up corpses.

Judge Criss told 'Inside Edition': 'This was a perfectly clean and preserved cat head cut up by someone who knew what they were doing laying right there.'

When asked who she thought did it, Criss replied: 'I strongly believe it was Robert Durst.'

Real estate millionaire Durst was arrested last Saturday in New Orleans for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman.

Durst has been charged with murder in a Los Angeles killing 15 years ago, and has been suspected — but never charged — in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. 

 His arrest came shortly before the finale of the HBO series 'The Jinx' which detailed his links to the three killings.

Judge Criss also said that she believes a young Durst killed his dogs and practiced cutting them up.

She claimed: 'He had seven dogs and he named every one of them 'Igor' and they all came to some unnatural deaths. Some very bizarre unnatural deaths.

'He practiced on those dogs and that's where he got some of those skills at cutting people up.'

The judge was referring to remarks made by Durst's younger brother, Douglas, last year when he told an interviewer that Robert had a 'series' of seven Alaskan Malamute dogs, each named Igor, who 'all died mysteriously, of different things, within six months of his owning them.' 

Durst was charged on Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster. 

He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime.

On Tuesday, Durst was transferred to a prison wing for the mentally ill in New Orleans while he awaits extradition to LA to face the first-degree murder charge. 

The troubled real estate heir was moved to the acute mental health facility at Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in Louisiana because he is considered a suicide risk, according to the sheriff's office on Wednesday.

Questions also surfaced over his links to two missing California girls. 

But police in Oakland, California, say they have found no evidence to link him to the 1997 disappearance of Charlotte teenager Kristen Modafferi.

A statement released yesterday said:  'The Oakland Police Department conducted an investigation with the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the 1997 disappearance of Kristen Modafferi.

'The investigation was open and active for several years. At this time we do not have any evidence that indicates Robert Durst was involved in her disappearance.'

Police in Eureka, California, do however remain interested in Durst in connection with another missing persons case.

Karen Mitchell, 16, was last seen on November 25, 1997 after leaving her aunt's Eureka home.
