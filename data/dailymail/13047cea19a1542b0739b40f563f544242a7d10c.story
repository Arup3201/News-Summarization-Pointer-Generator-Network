They say that honesty is the best policy - particularly in loving relationships.

But when it comes to matters of dress size, it seems that for women at least, truth is a dirty word.

A new survey has revealed that almost half of women admit to hiding their true dress size from their partners, friends and colleagues.

The latest research revealed that a third admitted to telling colleagues fibs when it came to their vital statistics, with 77 per cent of women wishing they were a size smaller.

Nearly half of British women lie about their dress size to friends, colleagues and partners after failing to slim down for summer

Just eight per cent of women polled were happy with their measurements this summer and it was a svelte size 12 that topped the charts as the most desired shape.

And ladies across the UK aren’t just twisting the truth about their dress size - 60 per cent even admit to inflating their bosom by at least one cup size. Busty 34D, or DD, topped the poll as the most longed-for bra sizes.

And as Brits strip down to summer dresses and vest tops in the summer months, sales of the 2 Sizes Bigger Bra by George at Asda, who carried out the survey, have risen by 162 per cent as women attempt to boost their assets.

Women claim bra size 34DD, like Tyra Banks, is the perfect measurement

Women consider size 12 - which Kim Kardashian and Nigella Lawson wear - the ideal 

And the porky pies don’t stop there - women are also lying about their shoe size.

Of the women polled, 78 per cent over a size seven admitted to shrinking their shoe
 size to their other half and friends, with size five being seen as
 ‘perfect’.

George at 
Asda spokesperson, Fiona Lambert, said: 'At George, we know that a 
woman’s dress size is a personal matter and a topic which many shoppers 
may not wish to discuss with others.

We say: give yourselves a break, ladies. Does anyone apart from you really care what your dress or shoes size is? You're simply condemning yourself to a lifetime of presents you'll have to sneakily swap for a size bigger.

Men are going to be even MORE confused! Ladies across the UK aren't just twisting the truth about their dress size as 60 per cent admit to inflating their bosom by at least one cup size
