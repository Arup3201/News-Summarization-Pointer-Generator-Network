Less than a day after former IRS official Lois Lerner was found in criminal contempt of Congress, her old agency has agreed to turn over copies of all her emails and other correspondence to one of the Republican-led House committees investigating the scandal that led to her retirement.

The agency's quick concession came after Wednesday night's 231-178 contempt vote, which closely followed the passage of a second resolution demanding the appointment of a nonpartisan 'special counsel' at the Department of Justice.

Lerner has twice refused to answer questions in congressional hearings after lawmakers issued a subpoena for her appearance.

'This is ALL Lerner documents,' a House Ways and Means Committee official confirmed to MailOnline.

All stick, no carrot: House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp warned the IRS he would start firing off subpoenas if it didn't cough up every Lois Lerner-related document it had

Lois Lerner, the former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations, angered Republicans during a 2013 House hearing by offering a self-serving opening statement about her role in the tea party targeting scandal, and then refusing to answer members' questions

'While it 
is good that we are finally getting these emails, it should never have 
taken this long,' committee chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, 
said Thursday in a statement. 'The agency is finally doing what is right and 
hopefully this is the last of the delays.'

'It
 is almost a year to the day since Lois Lerner "apologized" for the 
IRS’s targeting of conservative groups, and we need to get to the bottom
 of this.'

Lerner is accused of executing a plan to
 hamstring right-leaning nonprofit groups by slow-walking their 
applications for tax-exempt status. She ran the Exempt Organizations section of the IRS until her retirement in late 2013.

Ways and Means referred her case to the Justice Department for prosecution on April 9, charging that she 'used her position to improperly influence agency action against only conservative organizations, denying these groups due process and equal protection rights under the law.'

If she were convicted, Lerner would face a possible 1-year jail term and a fine of up to $100,000.

While the politically lopsided scheme was underway, hundreds of tea-party and other like-minded groups were delayed for three years or more, beginning in the run-up to the 2010 midterm congressional elections.

Liberal groups, meanwhile, were generally green-lighted quickly.

Camp's Ways and Means Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform have been probing whether the politically calibrated targeting was ordered from inside the White House.

They have already established that the cases of some groups denied tax exemptions were managed in Washington, not in the Cincinnati office where Lerner's subagency was based.

Camp warned the IRS in a February 24 letter that he would start issuing subpoenas if the agency didn't turn over the documents he wanted. Weeks later the agency promised it would start delivering – but Thursday's decision covers more Lerner-related documents than Congress has seen to date.

Meanwhile, the IRS has proposed a rewrite of its regulations governing communications restrictions on 'public benefit' organizations, like many tea party groups, which are exempt from paying federal income taxes.

Republicans have complained that the move merely seeks to cement in regulations what the Obama administration was allegedly doing outside public view.
