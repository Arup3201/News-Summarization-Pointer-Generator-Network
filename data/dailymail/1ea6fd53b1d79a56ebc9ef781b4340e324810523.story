When she suffered a massive stroke, Inger Wallis needed lifesaving five-hour surgery – and her distraught family were prepared for the worst. So it felt like a miracle that once she was allowed home, there were no significant lasting physical effects.

Or so it seemed. In fact, the damage caused by a burst blood vessel in her brain was far more insidious

Inger, 52, former manager of retail at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, recalls: ‘The stroke happened without any warning one morning as  a terrible pain in my head and uncontrollable sickness.

Invisible struggle: Inger Wallis, from London, has found that the stroke four-and-a-half years ago had left her unable to make even the simplest of decisions

‘Although I was home alone, I was able to call an ambulance myself,  and lived very close to University College Hospital, London, a specialist stroke centre. For months afterwards I had constant flashbacks of those moments, and couldn’t stop crying. But that was just the start of it.’

Inger found that the stroke four-and-a-half years ago had left her unable to make even the simplest of decisions, such as getting dressed.

‘I just sat in a chair for hours not knowing what to wear. It was the same with shopping.

‘Like most people, I always had a  list at the supermarket, but if the list didn’t specify exactly which brand name, I’d stand in an aisle not knowing which to buy.’

Professor Reg Morris, from Cardiff University, a psychologist who specialises in stroke, says: ‘A stroke can be caused by a blockage in the arteries that supply the brain or by bleeding, which can be caused by injury or a weakness in the blood vessels. The result is brain damage, which can affect everything from speech and movement to reading ability.

‘Normally, the worst impairment is seen immediately after a stroke  and, as bruising and swelling heals, improvement is seen. We know that two-thirds of stroke patients experience psychological problems, including depression, fatigue, sexual problems and changes in identity.

‘This can be the result of physical disability leading to isolation, but also happens without it. Whether or not the brain damage causes the psychological problems isn’t always clear.’

Further psychological assessment  at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London revealed the extent of Inger’s problems.

‘The things that had been affected were all the things I’d been good at: multi-tasking, forward-planning, thinking on the spot, working out implications, nuance. It made me laugh, then I cried.’

Her doctors referred her for psychotherapy to help her adjust. ‘I’d been a high achiever – an alpha female. At work, I had a staff of more than 50 and an £8 million budget.

‘With a husband and two teenage daughters, I would have said I was one of those “superwomen”. Suddenly, I had to adjust to a learning disability. Now I work one day a week welcoming visitors to my workplace. I’m especially geared up to look out for people like me with less obvious disability.’

Family life has changed, too. ‘My husband Simon, a supervisor at the National Gallery, has to run the house. We have a deep, loving relationship of companionship, but it’s not like before when we sparked off each other.

‘He cosseted me like an invalid for the first year afterwards, and is still terrified it could happen again.

She adds: ‘I still don’t like meeting new people as they’ll just think I’m slow. I can’t tell what direction sound comes from, so I feel disorientated  all the time and suffer massive anxiety because of it. It means I can’t go  to the cinema or pub any more, and  I watch television on my own as otherwise I keep asking what’s happening because I can’t follow complicated programmes.’

The effect on Inger’s daughters, Amber, 20, and Rosie, 24, was more dramatic. ‘They became noticeably distant,’ she says. ‘My doctor explained they were frightened of getting close again in case I died.

‘Then, about five months into my recovery, I noticed Amber was very thin. I was distraught when she was diagnosed with anorexia. Basically, she couldn’t control the outcome of my stroke but she could control eating.

‘Both are still looking for their “mum”. But I couldn’t cope with anything dramatic, like boyfriend troubles.’

Inger has been helped by counselling and occupational therapy and wants to emphasise the emotional impact a stroke can have. ‘There has been practical help – I have organised all my clothes into colours and outfits so I don’t have to make so many decisions when dressing. My therapist has helped me grieve for the person I used to be, but it has taken me three years to accept where I am now.’

New data suggests that stroke patients and their families in up to two-thirds of the country have no access to psychological support.

Inger says: ‘People need to realise that even if a survivor looks OK,  their lives are almost always much more challenging.’
