If you're keen to snap up the bargains for Christmas, then New York is the place you should be shopping.

One company has worked out that tourists flying to the Big Apple for shopping trips on Black Friday can actually save money - despite having to pay out for transatlantic flights.

Bargains on Friday November 28 - the day after Thanksgiving - are said to be so goo that British travellers can enjoy savings, even once they've taken out the cost of their flights.

Black Friday will bring hustle and bustle to the Big Apple - and UK travellers would do well to get involved

From Ray Ban sunglasses to the new iPad Air 2, travellers could save up to £400 on just nine wishlist items found stateside, meaning the savings could pay for the flight.

'For travellers keen to cash in on great savings, a pre-Christmas trip to the Big Apple could be just the ticket,' said Koko Sarkari, COO of International Currency Exchange (ICE), who carried out the research.

'Alternatively, California and Florida could still offer some sunshine, as well as seasonal shopping opportunities. With Black Friday discounts on American brands such as Apple, Michael Kors, Converse and Guess Jeans, UK shoppers will be in a strong position to bag a bargain.

'Die-hard shoppers should look out for stores opening on 'grey Thursday', which is Thanksgiving evening, as there will be some early discounts and you may even beat the queues.'
