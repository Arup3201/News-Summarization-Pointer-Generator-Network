The wife of Olympic ski champ Bode Miller has implied that the mother of his son fished a condom out of the trash to get pregnant.

Morgan Beck, a professional volleyball player, apparently made the bizarre accusation in a chat room for a pregnancy website  - just days after Miller and his ex reached a settlement in the bitter custody battle for their 18-month-old son.

'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom,' read the November 18 post on TheBump.com, PageSix first reported.

In an earlier post, she also revealed that she is 13 weeks pregnant.

The claims were made under the username '2015mamatobe', which used a photo showing Morgan Beck and Miller together. The photo and the posts have since been removed.

Miller and his ex, Sara McKenna, had a son together after meeting through a matchmaking service in 2012. McKenna calls the little boy Sam while Miller calls him Nathaniel, after his late brother.

Last week, they finally reached a settlement following a lengthy custody battle, but the details have not been released. 

After the posts appeared on TheBump earlier this week, McKenna also joined the website to stand up for herself, verifying it was her by sharing screen grabs of her email account.

She asked other forum members to send her anything '2015mamatobe' might have said about her online, and said that posts the user had written about 'daily random things' match Beck's life. 

She also dismissed the suggestion that she had used a used condom to get pregnant.

'Sam was conceived the old fashioned while we were on vacation in Florida,' she wrote, adding: 'This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.' 

Accusations: A user called 'GraceinCA' shared messages she had received from another user - believed to be Beck - with the name '2015mamatobe' on TheBump.com earlier this week

McKenna has previously said she and Miller did not use a condom at all when they conceived Sam.

'He never offered to use a condom,' she told the New York Daily News last year. 'He assumed I was ready to get pregnant.' 

Posting other messages on the website, '2015mamatobe' said she was just over 13 weeks pregnant.

'I really want/wanted to keep the news of my pregnancy quiet for now,' the user wrote on November 10, explaining that last time news of her pregnancy went public, she miscarried.

'Living that publicly was really hard. I don't mind if people know who we are (as if anyone would really care), but my family just has personal reasons for not wanting to be identified quite yet,' she said.

Morgan Beck miscarried a child with Miller in early 2013. She has not yet returned a request for comment.

As well as Sam, Miller also has an older daughter from a previous relationship.  

Truce: McKenna, pictured left outside court in December 2013, and Miller, right with Beck outside court in April, finally reached a custody agreement over the 18-month-old boy last week following the lengthy battle

After McKenna, then a firefighter, fell pregnant, Miller said he did not want to raise the boy together, and they moved their separate ways.

At seven months pregnant, McKenna moved from California to New York to attend Columbia University on the G.I. Bill, while he married volleyball player Morgan Beck. 

McKenna said she told him of her plans in a text message but he never responded.

But two weeks after Sam was born in February 2013, Miller filed for custody in California and she temporarily lost custody of him, McKenna recounted in an essay for Cosmopolitan.

It came just a month after Miller, now 37, and his wife Morgan, 27, experienced a miscarriage.

In September last year, a judge gave Miller full custody of Sam, calling McKenna's move to New York 'irresponsible' and 'irreprehensible'.

After losing Sam, McKenna's life turned into a 'nightmare' and she quit school and her job, she said.

But she soon realized that being 'catatonic wasn't helping matters' so she re-enrolled and continued her studies while relentlessly pursuing a way to get Sam back for good, she said in Cosmo. 

McKenna also tracked her son's life with Miller on her ex and his new wife's social media profiles and noticed they were calling him 'Nathaniel', after Miller's late brother.

'That was really heartbreaking,' she wrote. 'Our son's name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. Calling him anything else is just confusing.' 

The next time she saw her son was at a court hearing in November where she won back custody. She is now studying law in the hope of helping others going through the same ordeal.

Miller, a five-time world champion, still lives in California with his wife. He underwent minor back surgery on Monday but has said he hopes to be back to the sport by January.
