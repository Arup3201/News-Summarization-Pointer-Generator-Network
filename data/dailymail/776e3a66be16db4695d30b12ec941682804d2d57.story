'Hi Avonte, it's mom. Come to the flashing lights, Avonte.'

That is the audio message that repeatedly sounded over the speakers of a Citywide Disaster Services van that drove around Queens, New York, today and Wednesday, desperately scouring for an autistic 14-year-old boy who has been missing since October 4.

Avonte Oquendo is unable to communicate in words and has the mental capacity of a 7-year-old, so his mother, Vanessa Fontaine, recorded her voice in hopes that the teenager would listen to her and walk towards the lights of an emergency vehicle that has been out searching for him in Long Island City.

Gone: A flyer showing Avonte Oquendo, a missing 14-year-old autistic boy, is taped inside the window of a subway car in New York

Last resort: Vanessa Fontaine recorded her voice in hopes that Avonte, who is non-verbal, would listen to her and walk towards the lights of this Citywide Disaster Services van

Missing: Avonte Oquendo vanished October 4 from his Long Island City school in Queens, New 
York

Keith Brooks, program director at the 
not-for-profit group Citywide Disaster Services, which provides 
emergency communication services, told Fox News that today marked the 
first time that an audio recording was used to search for a missing
person.

On
Wednesday, New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said that 
the school safety officer who was the last person to see Avonte has been
cleared of any wrongdoing.

According
to Kelly, the guard ran into the teenager at the entrance of the 
Center Boulevard School and instructed him to return to class, but Avonte left 
through a side door.

However, Avonte's parents have indicated that they plan to sue their son's school for allegedly failing to keep him safe.

Queens Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer and volunteers were out this morning handing out flyers about the missing teen at train stations in Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside, and Woodside, according to The Forum.

Massive force: Hundreds of NYPD officers have joined the search for the missing teenager

By land and by air: NYPD spread out on foot and in the air via helicopter to continue their search

While
police and Metropolitan Transportation Authority employees have been 
scouring all of the city's 468 subway stops and tunnels for the missing child, who is
said to be fascinated by trains, his older brother used a kayak Tuesday
to search the waters off Queens.

Daniel
Quendo Jr's 90-minute aquatic expedition, however, yielded no new 
clues, leaving the 26-year-old sibling feeling more anxious than ever.  

'Maybe if he's not out in the street, then somebody does have him and I just hope that whoever does have my brother, they just give him up please so we can have him back,; he told CBS New York.

Surveillance footage from Avonte Oquendo’s school shows him running down a hall and out the door around noon on October 4.

On Sunday, the reward for Avonte's return had reached $70,000, including $50,000 from an anonymous donation to the group Autism Speaks.

Avonte was reportedly spotted at a school festival in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn last Saturday around 5:30pm, reports the Daily Dot.

‘The kid in reference caused a bit of a stir as he stood very close [to the DJ],’ wrote the children’s entertainment company FuziPop on their Facebook page, ‘trying to touch the DJ equipment multiple times.’

Surveillance footage from his school shows Avonte dashing down a hallway and out the door October 4. The search for the boy has now spread across New York City and into outlying areas of Long Island and New Jersey

Hopeful: Vanessa Fontaine, left, Avonte's mother, arrives to a vigil October 11 in Queens. Social media has continued to churn up leads in the case, but the boy remained missing Sunday morning

Avonte’s brother Danny has helped make the online search go viral in the days since his disappearance. Thousands of followers have been added to Danny’s social media accounts and a Facebook page called Missing Avonte Oquendo has become a virtual hub for the search.

Facebook followers have helped get the flier widely dispersed and have even gotten it translated into Chinese and Portuguese.

‘Avonte requires 24 hour supervision. He is 14 in body, but he has the mind of a very young child,’ reads the Facebook page. ‘Avonte has been alone for 10 days. He needs your help. He may appear dirty, he will have gone to the bathroom on himself, he may seem disoriented and no long answer to his name.’

Vigilant: A vigil was held Saturday as the search continued for Oquendo, with a focus on the areas in and around where Avonte was last seen in Long Island City, Queens

Hopeful: Two hundred transit workers fanned out on Saturday and thousands of other volunteers online and on the ground continued to help in the search Sunday. Avonte may have been sighted at a gathering in the DUMBO area of Brooklyn on Saturday

Avonte cannot care for himself and his family says he may appear soiled and has potentially stopped responding to his own name

On the ground, family and friends organized a vigil Saturday and search parties have fanned out from their headquarters in Queens across the city to help bring Avonte home.

'We get leads throughout the day, and whenever we get them, we try to take them seriously,' said Danny Oquendo. 'We call police detectives, then volunteers who go to that area.'

Sunday morning, the search seemed to be focused in an area of Queens north of where Avonte first disappeared.

‘We need more volunteers to canvas the Ditmars area with a focus around 19th and 20th Ave between 37th Street and 81st street,’ Danny urged on his Twitter account @KingDetrick. ‘Go in groups!’

Avonte was last seen wearing black jeans, black sneakers, and a grey striped shirt. He is 5-foot-3 and weighs 125 pounds. Anyone with information is urged to call the NYPD Crime Stoppers line at 800-577-TIPS.
