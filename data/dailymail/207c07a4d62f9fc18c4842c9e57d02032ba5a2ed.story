Baby Gammy's Australian parents have allegedly paid nothing towards supporting their unwanted child they left abandoned in Thailand nine months ago.

American agent Antonia Frattaroli, who handled the surrogacy, claims David and Wendy Farnell 'havent paid a cent' since instructing the agent to abandon Gammy outside a temple or ophanage when they were told it couldn't be aborted.

Mr Frattaroli said the Farnells agreed to a $2000 lump some and a monthly allowance to help with the biological mother's costs of caring for her Down syndrome baby.

The Australian parents also told their surrogacy agent to give their child up to an orphanage in Thailand

'He never sent her money once he got back to Australia,' Mr Frattaroli said.

The allegations against the Farnells come as Mr Frattaroli claims he was made to do the Farnell's 'dirty work,' such as separating the baby and mother from the Australian parents so they 'didnt have to see them.'

'They asked me if I could put the Down Syndrome baby in a different room so they wouldn’t have to look at them,' Mr Fratolli told 9NEWS.

He also alleges that the couple wanted the baby terminanted at five months - but when told 'you can't kill a baby at five months' instructed it to be abandoned outside a Thai temple or orphanage.

The explosive claims come nine months after the Farnells left Thailand with Gammy's healthy twin sister Pipah, leaving him behind.

In an email reportedly sent by Mr Farnell a month before the birth he wrote they had chosen 'to go with option 2'.

Mr Frattaroli said it was also agreed that the Farnells would  pay Ms Chanbua about $2000 a month as child costs, but as yet, have not paid a cent.

'He never sent her money once he got back to Australia,' Mr Frattaroli said.

He said he regrets having ever allowed the surrogacy to take place after admitting he did not screen the Farnells, which had he done would have revealed David's criminal past.

'I did not screen them, that’s my biggest mistake and I’ll admit that to the whole world,' he said.

Mr Frattaroli got into the surrogacy business after he and his wife used a surrogate themselves for their baby boys, but his agency Surrogacy Thailand is no longer in operation following this scandal.

He says he wanted to help others and never imagined encountering a situation like this.

The new light surrounding the surrogacy saga comes following revelations that baby Gammy was offered to another couple,  Kim and Brendan Cross, who themselves had been struggling to conceive a child for years and had turned to Thai surrogacy officials for help.

The Cross's were clients of Thailand Surrogacy for two years when they received an email from the company asking if they wanted Gammy, according to the ABC's 7.30 program.

'The email asked us if we wanted the baby ourselves. My assumption of why I was asked or why we were asked is because of the fact that we had been through this clinic for two years and without a successful pregnancy and maybe they thought this was an easy option for us to take this child instead of continuing on our path to have our own biological child.

'That’s just my opinion' she said, 'but of course we can’t accept someone else's child.

The Cross couple are now proud parents of four week old Braxton, born via a Thai surrogate and egg donor.

Kim Cross says she was 'mortified' by the way the Farnell family had treated  the baby

The Cross couple said the offer was one of several proposals from American Antonio Frattaroli, the boss of Surrogacy Thailand, who has gone to ground since the story went global.

The ABC reported that Mr Frattaroli denies any knowledge of Gammy being offered to another Australian couple and he is shocked by the suggestion.

The ABC also spoke with a colleague of Mr Frattaroli, who said that the baby's biological father Mr Farnell had asked for the baby to be bleft outside a Thai temple.

'He did not want the baby. He just wanted to do anything so that he would not have that baby,' she said.

Mr Farnell has previously denied that he wanted the child aborted.

The surrogacy worker alleges he asked: 'There is a normal one, can I take the normal one?

'Can you leave the abnormal one at the temple? Can you leave him in Bangkok? Nobody will know about this'

She says the company denied his proposal, and reportedly showed an email to ABC which showed Mr Frattaroli said:

'They beg me to drop baby Gammy at the temple at night and run away. They told me, 'don't worry, Antonio, the monk will take care of the baby.'
