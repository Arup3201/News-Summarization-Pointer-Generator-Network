Donncha O’Callaghan is set to make his Barbarians against England

Jonny Wilkinson plays his final game on Saturday and will be hoping to go out on another high in Paris when Toulon aim to add the Top 14 final to their Heineken Cup triumph of last weekend.

World Cup winner Wilkinson, who has scored more Test points than anyone other than Dan Carter, has never won the French domestic trophy.

A year ago Toulon lost to Castres  so revenge will also be on Wilkinson’s mind. However Castres, who squeaked through in sixth to make the play-offs, appear to have settled for a secondary role already.

‘I am lucky to be playing against Jonny in his last match. It is a great honour,’ said rival fly-half Remi Tales.

Meanwhile, Donncha O’Callaghan will follow in big brother Ultan’s footsteps tomorrow when he makes his Barbarians debut against an England XV at Twickenham.

The Munster and Ireland lock wore out his 101 Greatest Tries video as a youngster, constantly replaying Gareth Edwards’ classic 1973 Barbarians try against the All Blacks.

He said: ‘When we played rugby in the garden it was always the Baa-Baas v Ireland, because no one ever wanted to be Scotland or England! Even back then you threw the ball around. That’s the tradition. I was ready to swim over when I got the call.’

TV: England XI v Barbarians LIVE on Sky Sports 1 tomorrow from 2.30pm (ko 3pm).
