A woman is facing theft charges after she was caught on CCTV shoplifting a sex toy by putting it down her pants.

The incident occurred when LeAnn Frauens, 23, visited Intimate Treasures in Creastview, Florida, on October 29.

According to a Crestview Police Department arrest report, she was intoxicated when she entered the store supposedly to inquire about a job.

LeAnn Frauens, 23, was captured on CCTV drunkenly stealing a Short & Sweet vibrator by putting it down her pants

Frauens gave the store managed her name, address and telephone number.

Afterwards the manager noticed that an Evolved brand Short & Sweet vibrator - priced at $59.95 -  was missing from its display location and she contacted police, reports NWFDailyNews.

On reviewing video surveillance she spotted Frauens ‘manipulating the front of her pants and shirt, in an action consistent with concealing the device within her pants,’ the officer wrote in the report.

Police contacted the Frauens, whom they positively identified from the video, and showed her the incriminating footage.

The unnamed woman claims that she has no recollection of visiting Intimate Treasures in Creastview, Florida, at the end of October and leaving with stolen goods (not actual store)

‘As the defendant viewed her actions, she exclaimed in disbelief, “Oh my God. Look at what I’m doing. Oh my God. I’m gonna cry,”’ the report indicated.

‘After viewing the video footage, the defendant retrieved the stolen device, which had been used and was no longer in a condition to be returned to the business, and advised she did not remember taking it,’ the report stated.

Frauens, who has admitted that she was 
‘very drunk’ when she visited the store, has been charged with retail 
theft and has a November 26 plea date.
