Italian police are investigating the bizarre 'kidnapping' of sleazy former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's accountant whose key role was to pay women invited to the politician's infamous 'bunga Bunga' parties.

Giuseppe Spinelli, 71, was held hostage in his own home at gunpoint for 24 hours by six masked men who bundled him and his wife to the ground as he arrived home.

They had demanded 35 million Euros from Berlusconi in return for sensitive information which they said would show how he had been framed by former ally Gianfranco Fini in one of his numerous fraud trials.

Kidnapped: Giuseppe Spinelli, accountant and ally to former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, was taken hostage by armed men last month, police said today

Key role: It has been alleged that Mr Spinelli paid young women to attend Berlusconi's (pictured) notorious bunga bunga sex parties

However, no ransom money was handed over and Mr Spinelli and his wife Anna were not harmed in the incident, which took place on October 16. Police were only informed a day later after Berlusconi's personal security team ensured they were safe.

Today prosecutors questioned Mr Spinelli again about what happened at his Milan apartment, as it emerged that six people, three Italians and three Albanians, had been arrested by police in connection with the incident.

During the kidnapping terrified Mr Spinelli was ordered at gunpoint to call Berlusconi and demand the money in return for a CD which held evidence which would be useful to him in his fight against a 560m Euro fine he had been hit with after a corruption case finished.

However Niccolo Ghedini, who is Berlusconi's lawyer and who was also involved in negotiations with the kidnappers said no money was paid as it quickly became apparent the men had nothing of significance and were 'unable to show the documents.'

Mr Ghedini said: 'In truth they did not have anything in their hands. They kidnapped the accountant but Spinelli couldn't say anything as he was so scared about what might happen to his wife and daughter. He was terrified because he had a gun pointed at him.'

Police said the ringleader of the gang, Francesco Leone, 51, was traced after a fingerprint was found at the scene and by the fact he wore red and black trainers - the colours of AC Milan, the football team owned by Berlusconi.

Despite claims from Mr Ghedini that no ransom was paid, prosecutors in Milan were said to be investigating whether a sum of around eight million Euros was paid as part of a ransom in the days following the kidnap.

At the time of the incident Berlusconi had cancelled a scheduled meeting with Italian PM Mario Monti and a political conference in Bucharest, claiming he had a sudden bout of flu.

Milan police spokesman Alessandro Giuliano said: 'We have arrested six people but the investigation is still continuing and we are looking at the circumstances before the incident and also immediately afterwards.'

Mr Spinelli came into the spotlight last year after it emerged in Berlusconi's ongoing 'bunga bunga' trial that he had withdrawn 16 million Euros in cash from the media mogul's accounts to pay women who had been invited to the parties.

Troubles: Mr Berlusconi, pictured here at an AC Milan match with billionaire Flavio Briatore, cancelled a meeting with Italian PM Mario Monti around the time of the kidnapping, saying he had flu

Party girl: Mr Berlusconi was accused of having sex with Karima El-Mahroug, widely known as Ruby Rubacuori ('heart-stealer') in 2010 when she was 17

He had told the court: 'I was just following Berlusconi's orders. During the week the girls would speak to me and tell me what they needed then on Monday I would have a meeting with Berlusconi and he would tell me what amount to put in the envelopes.

'He asked me to bring the money in cash and I would put it in a safe at the villa. In 2009 I brought around €7,665,000 while in 2010 I brought around €12 million. Whenever large sums were needed I would forewarn the bank and they would break it down into smaller amounts for me.

'The money was for the girls living expenses and for bills, that sort of thing. We helped so many people and we still do.'

Berlusconi hosted the parties at his villa near Milan and his trial has heard how women performed pole dances and strip teases for him, some wearing football kits or police uniforms while others dressed as nuns.

He has insisted nothing untoward took place but he is on trial accused of paying an underage prostitute for sex and abuse of office. The case is just to end in January.
