Nicklas Bendtner will hold showdown talks with Arsene Wenger on Tuesday after returning to the training ground following a short illness.

The striker will be fined a week’s wages after he returned to Copenhagen last Tuesday and was involved in a late-night dispute with a taxi driver.

Bendtner, 26, had been left out of the Champions League squad travelling to Munich for Arsenal’s clash against Pep Guardiola’s side when he decided to return to Denmark.

Limping off: Bendtner leaves the pitch after scoring (right) against Cardiff on New Year's Day - it could turn out to be his last goal for Arsenal as he is set to leave the club in the summer

The Arsenal striker will accept the fine, but will attempt to provide some context to the dispute when he meets Wenger.

Bendtner, who has not been at training since the incident because of sickness, is out of contract at the end of the season and will be leaving the Emirates after a decade at Arsenal.

He already has a number of offers from clubs in other European countries and has told friends he is ready to knuckle down after the latest high profile incident in his career.
