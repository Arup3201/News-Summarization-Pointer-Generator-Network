Manchester United are considering a lucrative post-season tour to Asia to make up for the absence of Champions League football this year.

The Premier League club will reveal the exact cost of last season’s disastrous campaign under David Moyes when they release their quarterly figures. 

However the drop in annual revenue is expected to be in the region of £45m after United failed to make the cut for European football of any kind.

Now it can be revealed that United are discussing a ground-breaking tour of the Far East to supplement an expected visit to the Middle East in January. Neither projects have yet been rubber-stamped by the United board or by manager Louis van Gaal but the club are aware that there are gaps in the calendar that would enable them to make the trips.

With United set to return to America for the next summer’s pre-season tour, a post-season venture in May – lasting a week – would bring the clubs some revenue and help sate the appetite of millions of Asian fans who haven’t seen the club’s star players in the flesh since Moyes and his squad travelled to Thailand, Australia and Japan in the July of 2013.

In terms of a January game, the Middle East remains the most likely venue for a fixture, possibly against AC Milan, but it is understood United have a number of options open to them in terms of a staging venue and opponents and that no decision has yet been made on whether to pursue a game which could be worth in the region of £3m to the club.

Meanwhile, United midfielder Daley Blind is due to undergo a scan today to assess the extent of knee ligament damage suffered while playing for Holland against Latvia on Sunday.

Initial examination has led to suggestions that Blind suffered medial ligament damage and will be sidelined for 4-6 weeks.

United goalkeeper David de Gea will also have damage to his finger assessed this week before the club consider their options for the game against Arsenal this weekend. Former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes has been training with United but is not yet fit enough to be considered following knee surgery.
