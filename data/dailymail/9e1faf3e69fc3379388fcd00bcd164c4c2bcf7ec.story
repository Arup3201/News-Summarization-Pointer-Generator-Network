It may be war-torn but it's still hot on the housing market. Now you can own the backdrop from the film Zero Dark Thirty for $7.5 million.

The Blue Cloud Movie Ranch in California's Santa Clarita Valley specializes in sets that look like Afghanistan during time of war and are almost entirely accurate.

The ranch has also been used as a backdrop in Iron Man and some episodes of True Blood in addition to the film Zero Dark Thirty, reports curbed.com.

According to the LA Times, the set is so realistic that, 'the U.S. military uses it for training purposes.'

The man who currently owns the property is a former stuntman named Rene Veluzat and he gets lots of requests to purchase the property so it will probably sell. 'I get 50 phone calls a day,' he told the L.A. Times last year.

The land has multiple movie backdrops called the 'Foreign Courtyard,' 'The Cave,' 'Army Camp,' 'Helicopter Crash,' '50s Town,' and 'Third World Country.' Now these dilapidated sets can belong to you.

It may look broken but it's rather expensive to purchase the Afghanistan inspired set

It's only $7.5 million to reserve a permanent space in this broken down home

The property is equipped with totaled vehicles and plenty of sharp rocks

The land stretches 100 acres and has numerous sets also used in True Blood and Iron Man

The sets are almost entirely accurate and are used as training grounds for the U.S. Army

This photo from Zero Dark Thirty shows Navy SEALs seen through the greenish glow of night vision goggles, as they prepare to breach a locked door in Osama Bin Laden's compound

Some of the sets are dilapidated and some are more reminiscent of per-war times

The sets are extremely detailed and visitors may actually believe they are in Afghanistan

Each corner of this $7.5 million piece of history is crumbling more than the last

This cave is man made and was the backdrop of a major motion picture

The middle east is known for having oil and this gas station is an almost exact replica of one in Afghanistan

Sets with props like a soccer ball and wooden chairs show just how no detail was spared in the creation of the elaborate backdrops

Buyers may have to battle over the property for which the owner receives '50 calls per day'
