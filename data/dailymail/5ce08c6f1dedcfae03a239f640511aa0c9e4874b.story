A stray pit bull puppy has been rescued from the streets of Detroit with a metal link used for mountain climbing wedged in his mouth.

The 10-month-old male pup nicknamed Boulder was spotted October 14 wandering around the area of Interstate 94.

The brown American pit bull was walking around with a metal ring clamped tightly around his jaw, with a length of thick metal chain hanging from his mouth.

Starving: The carabineer and metal chain were clamped tightly around the pup's jaw, preventing him from eating and drinking

The carabineer prevented the animal from eating, drinking or barking, according to the Michigan Humane Society, which ended up taking him in.

When Boulder arrived at a Humane Society shelter, volunteers gently removed the metal ring and the links.

‘As soon as they got the clamp off of him, he was immediately running around and licking people,’ Humane Society spokesperson Ryan McTigue told the Detroit Free Press.
