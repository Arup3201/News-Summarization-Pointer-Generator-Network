American parents are set to be given the option to have their the genomes of healthy newborn babies sequenced as part of a government-funded research program that could herald a revolution in medicine. 

The National Institutes of Health last year awarded a combined $25 million to four projects looking at different aspects of gene sequencing in newborns.

Now, they are set to begin testing for some parents within weeks.

Testing could even result in 'genetic passports' which could be used years later to help develop personalized medical treatment, such as choosing the most effective asthma medication.

Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Boston Children's Hospital are set to begin testing within weeks. 

Parents of several hundred healthy and sick newborn infants will be offered genomic sequencing in a research setting beginning in early 2015, the hospital says.

It will enroll 240 healthy newborn infants and their parents at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and 240 infants and their parents from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Boston Children’s Hospital in the scheme.

Experts believe that genome sequencing could one day be part of routine testing done on every baby. 

This would provide doctors and parents a vast pool of data likely to reveal a wider range of potential medical risks than the traditional heel-prick test, in which a small sample of newborns' blood is taken to check for more than two dozen possible conditions.

It could even result in 'genetic passports' which could be used years later to help develop personalized medical treatment, such as choosing the most effective asthma medication.

The experiments coma after the National Institutes of Health last year awarded a combined $25 million to four projects looking at different aspects of gene sequencing in newborns. 

Participating hospitals include University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which expects in 2015 to begin investigating gene sequencing in both healthy newborns and ill infants, and University of California, San Francisco, which will sequence previous heel-prick samples with the aim of improving the accuracy of newborn screening.

Brigham and Women's Hospital, together with Boston Children's Hospital, formed the BabySeq Project earlier this year. 

Pending final approval, it expects to begin offering gene sequencing next year to some parents of healthy and sick newborns.

It also comes as a major new study suggests that if newborn genomic testing becomes available, there would be robust interest among new parents, regardless of their demographic background

The study, led by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Boston Children's Hospital, found that the majority of parents surveyed were interested in newborn genomic testing.

As next-generation whole-exome and genome sequencing is integrated into clinical practice, researchers and clinicians are increasingly interested in genomic testing as a way to provide valuable personalized health information for newborns beyond what existing standard newborn genetic screening produces. 

But such testing, done shortly after birth, will require the interest and consent of new parents.

'Several other studies have measured parents' interest in newborn genomic screening, but none focused on new parents in the first 48 hours,' said Robert C. Green, MD, MPH, a geneticist and researcher at BWH and Harvard Medical School and senior author of the study. 'Since this is when genomic testing would be of the greatest value, it is especially important to study parents' attitudes immediately post-partum.'

The researchers surveyed 514 parents at the well baby nursery at BWH within 48 hours of their child's birth. 

After receiving a brief orientation to the genome and its impacts on human health, 82.7 percent of parents reported being somewhat (36 percent), very, (28 percent) or extremely (18 percent) interested in newborn genomic testing. 

Results were similar regardless of parents' age, gender, race, ethnicity, level of education, family history of genetic disease, or whether or not the infant was a first-born child. 

Parents who had experienced concerns about the health of their newborn, however, were less likely to be interested in genomic testing.

The study was also the first to investigate whether asking parents about their interest in newborn genomic testing would cause them to reject existing, state-mandated newborn genetic screening (NBS), one of the most established and successful public health programs in the world.

Earlier this year the eleven English centres that will spearhead a genetic revolution in the NHS were named.

The Genomic Medicine Centres (GMC) are the heart of the 100,000 Genomes Project, a bold plan to map 100,000 complete genetic codes of patients.

Scientists and doctors hope the £300 million initiative will transform medicine by uncovering DNA data that can be used to develop personalised diagnostic procedures and drugs.

More than 100 patients with cancer and rare inherited diseases have already had their genomes sequenced during the project's pilot phase.

The first wave of GMCs will be linked to NHS trusts in 11 locations covering London, Manchester, Oxford, Birmingham, Cambridge, Southampton, Exeter and Newcastle.

Ultimately the aim is to secure the participation of more than 100 NHS trusts over the project's three-year lifespan.

Combining information from DNA samples with patients' health records will improve the prediction and prevention of cancers and rare diseases, experts believe.

It should also aid the development of more targeted diagnostic tests and drug treatments tailored to patients' genetic make-up.

Although strict security measures are in place to protect the identity and private details of patients, universities and drug companies will be allowed to use the data for research.

Life Sciences Minister George Freeman described the establishment of the centres as 'historic'. 

'If even one parent had rejected it, that would have been a problem,' said Susan Waisbren, PhD, lead author of the study and a psychologist and researcher in the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children's and Harvard Medical School.

'But out of over 500 parents surveyed, not one of them questioned or rejected NBS.'

The study was also the first to survey parents separately. 

Most couples were in agreement about their level of interest in newborn genomic testing.

'About 75 percent of couples were in concordance,' Waisbren said. 

'This suggests that both parents should be involved when we are addressing concerns they may have about newborn genomic testing.'

'Parents' strong interest in genomic screening for their newborns, as demonstrated by this study, underscores the importance of further research exploring the public health impacts of actually providing this testing,' said Green, 'particularly as it continues to become less expensive and more widely available.'
