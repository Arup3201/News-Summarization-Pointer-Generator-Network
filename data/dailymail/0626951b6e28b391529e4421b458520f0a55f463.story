Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse has called upon his side to prove they can cut it with England’s elite by halting leaders Chelsea.

Ronald Koeman’s side head into Sunday's clash on the back of two consecutive wins that have propelled them back into the Champions League positions.

The jury remains out over whether the Saints can sustain their top-four tilt but Ward-Prowse has urged his side to fire a statement of intent to the rest of the Premier League.

‘It is very important we get a result, Chelsea are a fantastic side and have a lot of world-class players,’ said Ward-Prowse. ‘If we are to get to where we want to get to — in Europe and stuff like that — we’re going to have to beat teams like this. That’s a sort of challenge and we’re ready for it. The game will be a measure of how far we’ve come.

‘We’re not looking at it as a game that we’re the underdog and sit back and hope to win — we’re going to go out level with them and we’re excited for the challenge.’

But Ward-Prowse admits Sadio Mane’s departure to the Africa Cup of Nations next month will come as a huge blow to the Saints.

The forward, who scored one and made another in the 3-1 Boxing Day win at Crystal Palace, will head off with Senegal.

‘We’ll miss him, he’s been a key player for us and you saw from his performance against Palace he’s a big asset,’ said Ward-Prowse. ‘But by him going it opens up the door for someone, who has to come in and step up to the plate.’

Influential midfielder Dusan Tadic is ready to start today after the £11million Serbian missed three games through a groin injury.
