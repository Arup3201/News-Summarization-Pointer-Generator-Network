Talk about dirty politics.

On Saturday Night Live, Melissa McCarthy played a crazed congresswoman, parodying the recent threats made by Rep. Michael Grimm (R-NY) against a reporter after being pressed on fundraising allegations.

Framed as a local news report, SNL cast member Taran Killam played a Delaware 1 news anchor named David LaPierre.

His report included updates on the shocking behavior of freshman Delaware congresswoman Sheila Kelly, played by McCarthy -- whose behavior outdoes Grimm's.

Confronted by a reporter on illegal campaign finances. Kelly says 'We will talk about the planning committee and nothing else.' When pressed, she adds 'We're done here.'

At one point her character gets so angry all that is intelligible is 'angry gibberish'

Kelly's anger escalates, imitating Grimm's threats to throw a reporter off of a balcony -- at one point yelling 'You ever been thrown out a window, bro? Because you know what? Because when I do it, I don't open it first. So you go down with the glass. You get that?'

Her character berates the reporter, saying 'You're not a man [...] you're a little baby and I'm going to put you in a stroller.' She refers to the famed baby stroller scene in 'The Untouchables' -- and that there is no Andy Garcia character to save him.

The congresswoman is caught in other camera angles, becoming increasingly hostile.

'You f****** filming me?' she asks. She engages in a physical altercation, yelling 'I am freshman congressman Sheila Kelly and I am invincible!'

The skit soon shows the congresswoman kicking a car from a parking garage camera, getting completely out of control.

'I'm going to blow your f****** eardrums!' she yells to a man in the garage.

In a drastic move, McCarthy's Kelly then shoots the security camera straight on.

Killam's character then shows the latest footage capturing the politician's erratic behavior.

When confronted by two policeman in the skit, she kicks them and manages to steal a car and yell 'I'm going to live forever!'

'You ever been thrown out a window, bro? Because you know what? Because when I do it, I don't open it first. So you go down with the glass. You get that?' she yells in the skit

The skit poked fun at the behavior of Rep. Michael Grimm, who threatened to throw NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto off the Capitol balcony when asked about campaign finances earlier this week.

MailOnline earlier reported that Grimm said to Scotto 'you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony' before threatening to break Scotto in half 'like a boy'.

Media website Gawker has even publicly wondered if Grimm's attacks were made because Scotto is gay. The website poses the question: If Scotto didn't ask Grimm anything about his or anyone else's sexuality, then why did the congressman fire back a stream of insults aimed at questioning the reporter's masculinity.

Grimm has not been charged in light of his recent comments against Scotto.

Earlier this month, the FBI charged Grimm’s donor Diana Durand with exceeding the maximum allowable contribution to the Republican’s campaign by asking her friends to donate $10,000.

Grimm, 47, has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged.

This is not the Congressman's first threat of violence -- The New Yorker reported in 2011 that he got into a fight with a man at a Queens nightclub more than a decade earlier.

He allegedly said the man 'don’t know who he’s f***ing with...I’ll f***in’ make him disappear where nobody will find him'.

A video skit on SNL also poked fun at the fact that February is Black History Month.

Keenan Thompson, Jay Pharoah, and Sasheer Zamata are seen as students in a classroom doing a class presentation.

The trio list '28 reasons to hug a black guy' to their white classmates and teacher -- listing reason number one as 'We deserve a chance' ... and reasons two through 28 as simply 'Slavery.'

Pharoah raps, repeating the word 'slavery' over and over, while Zamata sings the hook for the catchy tune.

Thompson's character raps that black people love white people too.

'We love Michael MacDonald and Daryl Hall,' Thompson says in the video.

Bobby Moynihan, playing a clueless classmate, says 'Let me plays devil's advocate' -- before being quickly silenced by his teacher.

Towards the end of the video, Thompson, Pharoah and Zamata lead a chant saying 'When I say "slavery" you say "sorry!" Slavery! Sorry!'
