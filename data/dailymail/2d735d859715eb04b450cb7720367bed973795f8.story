The cruel fortunes of Andy Carroll got significantly worse on Friday with confirmation that he will miss the rest of the season because of torn ligaments in his left knee.

It is a devastating development for the West Ham striker, who learned on Friday afternoon that he will require surgery for the second time in seven months.

Hours earlier, Sam Allardyce indicated the 26-year-old would be out for ‘four to six weeks’ with a torn medial ligament, but subsequent assessment from a specialist ended Carroll’s campaign.

September 2012 - Picks up hamstring injury in his first game on loan - out for a month

November 2012 -Twists knee against Manchester United - sidelined for two months

May 2013 - Damages heel in the last game of the season - out for seven months

July 2014 - Tears ankle ligaments in pre-season - sidelined for four months

February 2015 - Tears knee ligaments against Southampton - out for the season

An operation has been scheduled for Tuesday. There must now also be longer-term fears for a player who has started just 24 times in the last 18 months because of three different injuries.

Speaking before the scale of this latest injury was fully known, Allardyce said yesterday: ‘It is a big blow for him and us but it is one we have to cope with.

‘It is traumatic when someone is going through a period when in a short time they overcome one injury and another occurs.

Asked about Carroll’s morale, Allardyce added: ‘Not very good.’

Carroll made his first appearance of the season in November because of ankle problems that required surgery in pre-season. Hopes for that comeback were high after Carroll scored five goals in 11 league starts. 

But the former England striker then injured his left knee against Liverpool on January 31 and it was on his return from that injury that Carroll, appearing as a substitute against Southampton on Wednesday, suffered his latest problem to the same knee.

With West Ham having used their substitutes and down to 10 men, Allardyce left Carroll on the pitch to help grind out the 0-0 draw. With hingsight, that decision appears to have backfired on a player who cost West Ham £15m in June 2013.

It means West Ham are likely to pair Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho up front in today’s FA Cup fifth-round tie against West Brom.

Referring to Carroll, West Ham co-chairman David Gold said yesterday: ‘He was desperately unlucky to pick up a new injury.’

West Ham had better news from the FA, who have overturned the red card shown to goalkeeper Adrian against Southampton. However, West Ham have been charged with ‘failing to ensure it players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion’ following the sending off. They have until the evening of February 18 to answer the charge.
