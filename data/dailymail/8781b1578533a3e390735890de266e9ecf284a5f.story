She seems to never have a free second - jetting all around the world for her various professional commitments.

But yesterday Rihanna decided to put her family first as she flew from Los Angeles to New York just to spend some time with her grandmother Clara 'Dolly' Brathwaite, who is suffering from cancer.

The 24-year-old singer tweeted a picture of herself with her relative in the hospital, writing on her Twitter page: 'Came to NY, just for this moment right here!'

'I came to New York just for this moment': Rihanna jetted into Manhattan yesterday to spend some time with her sick grandmother Dolly

In the shot, Rihanna is seen leaning in to receive a tender cuddle from Dolly.

Rihanna was earlier seen heading to the hospital in Manhattan with her grandfather Lionel.

However, the trip to New York really 
was a flying visit as after just one day, Rihanna flew back to Los 
Angeles to continue with her hectic schedule.

Rihanna has told fans that she is relocating to London for the next couple of months.

The singer announced the news over Twitter yesterday, revealing that she will be making the move on Monday.

She wrote: 'Moving to London in 2 days!!!!!!' and added 'For a cpl months' (sic).

When grilled by upset US-based fans on what the UK offers that America does not, she replied: 'Life.'

It is believed that Rihanna will be shooting scenes for her fashioned-based reality series Henry Holland and Nicola Roberts in London.

She kept fans updated with her travelling plans, writing on her Twitter: 'From N.O to N.Y to L.A less than 24 hrs #rocstars**t #daddyshome.'

Rihanna is very close to her 
grandmother Dolly - mother of her mother Monica Braithwaite - and always
does everything she can to spend special occasions with her family.

In March, Rihanna flew back to New York to throw Dolly a birthday party, later sharing candid photos from the party, in which Dolly was seen wearing baseball caps, 
sunglasses and chains over her quilted dressing gown as she struck a 
pose for her famous granddaughter's camera.

Following her trip to the hospital 
yesterday, Rihanna was seen arriving at New York's JFK airport in the 
same outfit she had worn earlier in the day - a casual look of a black 
T-shirt bearing the slogan 'Vision Street Wear' teamed with jeans and 
trainers.

Rihanna topped off the outfit with a backwards baseball cap, sunglasses and pointed nails covered in bright yellow polish.
