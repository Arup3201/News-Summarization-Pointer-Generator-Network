One volunteer celebrated winning an award at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in quite an unusual way today.

Tim Wilkinson was so ecstatic that Trailfinders Australian Garden won the RHS Chelsea Flower Show Best in Show award that he celebrated by stripping off and jumping into a nearby water feature.

Tim went where no man has gone before by streaking through the gold-standard garden - and his team seemed to be encouraging him to take the plunge.

That's one way to celebrate: Volenteer Tim Wilkinson showed off the teams award in the water

And it comes as no surprise that he was in such good spirits. This is the ninth year for the 
Trailfinders-sponsored garden but the first year it has won Best in Show.

It 
took a staggering 17 days and over 2,500 people hours to build.

Celebrations all round: Director of Fleming's nurseries Wes Fleming (black coat), Garden Designer Phillip Johnson (checked shirt) join volenteers in celebrating the Trailfinders Australian Garden winning the gold medal

Jumping for joy: This is the ninth year for the Trailfinders-sponsored garden but the first it has won Best in Show

Flemingâ€™s Nurseries 
and the Victoria State Government sponsored the garden, which included native Australian plants including kangaroo paws and bottle trees.

Whether of not the monarch was treated to the sight of the streaking man is currently unconfirmed.

Not long before the streaking incident unfolded, the Queen was shown the Trailfinders Australian garden and admired an 
imposing pine and aluminium studio made in the shape of the Australian 
national flower, the waratah, which towered above the plants.

The chamber, reached by a spiral staircase, was designed specifically with the Queen - and in particular, her height - in mind.

If
she were to stand in the middle, the wooden petals would come out of 
her line of vision, giving her an uninterrupted view of the Australian 
native plants below.

However the 87-year-old royal did not try this and made do with standing at ground level and looking up at it.

Johnson described being involved as 'a dream come true.'

He said: 'Winning an award among contemporaries of this calibre is absolutely mind-blowing. We couldn't be more proud of what we have achieved, it's been an incredible experience.'

For her majesty: It is unclear whether she witnessed the streaking man but the chamber, reached by a spiral staircase, was designed specifically with the Queen - and in particular, her height - in mind

Ecstatic: The team celebrated the garden, which took a staggering seventeen days and over 2,500 people hours to build
