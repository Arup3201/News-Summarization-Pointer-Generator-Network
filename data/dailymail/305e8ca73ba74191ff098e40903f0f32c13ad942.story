An American health official has warned the deadly Ebola virus still has the upper hand in the outbreak that has killed more than 1,400 people in West Africa.

During a visit to Liberia on Tuesday, Dr Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued the stark warning but pledged that experts would continue to try and halt the spread of the infection.

Liberia along with Sierra Leone and Guinea have been hardest hit by the outbreak and Nigeria has also confirmed they too have cases but officials there have expressed optimism the virus can be controlled.

Speaking at a meeting attended by the Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Dr Frieden said: 'Lots of hard work is happening. Lots of good things are happening.

'But the virus still has the upper hand.

'Ebola doesn't spread by mysterious means. We know how it spreads.

'So we have the means to stop it from spreading, but it requires tremendous attention to every detail.'

It comes as medical staff in protective clothing transported a patient infected with the Ebola virus from an aircraft to an ambulance in Hamburg in nothern Germany.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) employee who has contracted Ebola is the first patient with the virus to be treated in the country, officials said.

An ambulance drove on to the tarmac to collect the patient, who was greeted by health workers wearing protective suits 

The Senegalese epidemiologist who was infected in Sierra Leone was to be taken to an isolation ward of the UKE university hospital in Hamburg.

It comes as Liberia has now resorted to stringent measures to try to halt Ebola's spread but frustration has mounted over the slow collection of bodies from neighborhoods in the capital Monrovia.

A group of residents even attached plastic ties to the wrists and ankles of one suspected Ebola victim and dragged his corpse to a busy street.

The patient is a Senegalese epidemiologist, who was infected while working in the west African country of Sierra Leone 

The patient was taken by ambulance to to the UKE university hospital in Hamburg to receive treatment 

Authorities have decreed that all the dead must be collected by government health workers and cremated because contact with bodies can transmit the virus.

There is no proven treatment for Ebola, so health workers primarily focus on isolating the sick.

A small number of patients have received an experimental drug called ZMapp. The London hospital treating a British nurse infected in Sierra Leone, William Pooley, said he is now receiving the drug.

It was unclear where the doses for Mr Pooley came from as the California-based maker of ZMapp has said its supplies are exhausted.

Two Americans, a Spaniard and three health workers in Liberia have received ZMapp. It is unclear if the drug is effective.

The Americans have been released from the hospital, but the Spaniard died, as did a Liberian doctor.

Meanwhile in Nigeria, two more Ebola patients were declared to have recovered and were released from hospital, Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu confirmed.

Five people have died of the disease in the country, while a total of seven have recovered. One person remains in the hospital in an isolation ward, Chukwu added.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has announced that it is pulling out its team from the eastern Sierra Leonean city of Kailahun, where an epidemiologist working with the organisation was recently infected.

Daniel Kertesz, the organization's representative in the country, said that the team was exhausted and that the added stress of a colleague getting sick could increase the risk of mistakes.

Also, Canadian health officials said in a statement that they would evacuate a three-member mobile laboratory team in Sierra Leone after people in their hotel were diagnosed with Ebola.

The outbreak is the largest on record. Doctors took a long time to identify it in a region where people are highly mobile.

It has spread to densely populated areas, and many people have resisted or hid from treatment. The disease has overwhelmed the already shaky health systems in some of the world's poorest countries.

According to WHO, the Ebola outbreak has killed over half of the more than 2,600 people sickened. The U.N. agency said an unprecedented 240 health care workers have been infected.

The agency attributed the high number of infections among health workers to a shortage of protective gear, improper use of such equipment, and a shortage of staff to treat the tremendous influx of patients.

In the current outbreak, as many as 90,000 protective suits will be needed every month, according to Jorge Castilla, an epidemiologist with the European Union Commission's Department for Humanitarian Aid. He did not say how many suits were lacking.

The outbreak also desperately needs more workers to trace the people the sick have come into contact with and more centers where patients can be screened for the disease in a way that contains any Ebola infections, Castilla added.

Meanwhile an Ebola outbreak emerged over the weekend in Congo, though experts say it is not related to the West African epidemic.

Doctors Without Borders, which is running many of the treatment centres in the West Africa outbreak, said it is sending experts and supplies to Congo but warned that the charity's resources are stretched thin.
