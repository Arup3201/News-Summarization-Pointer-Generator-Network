Saving money: Stephen Crabb told shocked mandarins he was getting rid of the car

Cabinet new boy Stephen Crabb’s first act as Welsh Secretary was to scrap his £100,000-a-year, taxpayer-funded Jaguar limousine.

Minutes after arriving at his new Whitehall department, he told shocked mandarins to get rid of the car to save money.

Instead, Mr Crabb, 41, pictured right, plans to use public transport to get to work, and one of the Government’s pool of eco-friendly Toyota Prius cars when necessary.

His predecessor as Welsh Secretary, David Jones, who was fired last week, was accused last year of abusing his chauffeur-driven Jaguar, which costs £8,000 a month. 

Jones was branded ‘lazy’ and ‘shameful’ after he used the luxury car to travel 100m from his office to Downing Street and then back again.

He took the short trip to a Cabinet meeting in his ministerial car even though it would have taken just a few minutes to walk. His chauffeur stayed outside No 10 for 90 minutes and then drove him back to his office.

Government ‘pool cars’ cost a more modest £10,000 a year.

A source said: ‘Stephen wants to show that he believes in saving public money where possible.

‘He has always travelled by bus and train and sees no reason to change everything.’
