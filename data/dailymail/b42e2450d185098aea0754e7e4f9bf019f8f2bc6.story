Manuel Pellegrini claimed Sergio Aguero is the world’s best striker after his stunning hat-trick kept Manchester City’s Champions League dream alive.

Aguero scored an incredible 90th minute winner - in scenes reminiscent of his famous goal against QPR on the final day of the 2012 season - to seal an unlikely 3-2 win against 10-man Bayern Munich.

Victory against Roma at the Olympic Stadium on December 10 will guarantee their passage into the second round of the Champions League.

Pellegrini said: ‘Sergio is one of the best players in the world and one of the best strikers.

‘He played well and so did the team in the second half. We conceded at the end of the first half the two goals, but we trust, we pressed and finally we got the chances for Sergio to score.

‘We have to do our duty. We have won the first one and now we must beat Roma away.

‘This kind of victory is very important, we will see what happens in the last game and whether we have a mathematical chance to qualify.

‘My first thought is that we conceded two goals in the way we did and it is difficult to win from that position.

‘At half time I told the players we have 45 minutes to stay in the Champions League.

‘To beat Bayern Munich, who had so much possession and to not to lose our spirit after losing those two goals, we were never beaten.

‘This is not of the most dramatic night or the most important of my managerial career - it was just a group game, but it was important to stay in the Champions League. The emotion was dramatic, but I trust the team to do the job.’

Aguero scored from the spot in the 22nd minute after Medhi Benatia was sent off for hauling down the forward.

Xabi Alonso equalised with a free-kick after 40 minutes and Robert Lewandowski put Bayern’s 10 men in front.

City captain Vincent Kompany claimed Aguero, who made it 2-2 in the 85th minute, had made their Champions League dream possible.

He said: ‘If you want to succeed at anything, you need a special player in a special form, otherwise you just don't win anything.

‘He's our special player and when he's in that form he makes things achievable that otherwise wouldn't be.’

Aguero added: ‘I'm very happy for us, the three points are very important. It was difficult but we are happy because this game was very important. It was a game we had to win.’

Beaten Bayern coach Pep Guardiola said: ‘We lost but I am very proud of my team. As a coach playing against the Premier League champions is a challenge and we played with 10 men for much of the game. We played an aggressive game, it can happen in the Champions League.

Pep Guardiola looks stunned as his Bayern Munich side throw away their lead late on

‘If it happened in the last 16 we would be out.

‘We dominated, but we made two mistakes and lost. We didn’t deserve this. When we play **** we lose.

‘Manchester City know that we will try to win the CSKA game.’
