A man desperate to have a perfect smile like singer Lana Del Rey spent a fortune on fillers that would give him the singer's luscious lips, but he was left with a trout pout instead.

Dean, 24, from Newcastle, now says he wishes he'd never undergone the beauty treatment three years ago. 

Speaking on the documentary Bodyshockers, which airs on Channel 4 tonight, he said: 'I regretted it pretty much instantly. I looked in the mirror and thought "what have I done?"'

Dean's lips inflated to twice their normal size and it took six months for the swelling to subside. 

He was then left with sore and achy lumps under his top lip.

He said: 'Inside when you touch it, you can feel all these hard lumps. When I turn my lip up you can see tube-like lumps.

'They are really sensitive and sting when I eat certain foods or use lip balm.'

Dean's boyfriend, Darren also joked that his lips looked like sausages and claims they make kissing unpleasant. 

He said: 'When I kiss you I can feel them. I would prefer him to have a natural look.'

Dean agreed that he wanted to go back to how he was before the beauty treatment.

He said: 'I want to reverse it, I want to get back to natural-looking lips, I don't want Darren to feel lumps like frozen peas when he's kissing me.'

The cameras followed Dean as he has a reversal treatment where a chemical is injected into his lips. 

The chemicals are designed to break down the filler that is in lip, so they can then be sucked out.

Dean paid for lip fillers so that he could look like the celebrity Lana Del Rey 

Surgeon Dr Esho of Le Beau Ideal, who performed the procedure for Dean on Bodyshockers last night, said:

'Dean had very lumpy, over filled lips. This is characteristic and common from overuse of filler. 

'Luckily his fillers were semi-permanent, so using a product called hylase I was able to give precise injections into the lip, dissolve the filler and restore his lips.'

Afterwards, Dean said he was delighted with the result. He said: 'The sensation of having small marbles under my lip is gone now, it feels back to normal.' 

Bodyshockers: Nips, Tucks and Tattoos is on Channel 4 Wednesdays at 10pm
