With his public school education and aristocratic-sounding name, it’s hardly surprising Benedict Cumberbatch has been branded one of Britain’s poshest actors.

But the Sherlock and Star Trek star has railed against the tag, insisting it’s unfair to typecast him as another stereotypical ‘posh kid’.

In an interview with today’s Mail on Sunday Event magazine, he says: ‘There’s always going to be somebody spitting blood about my wooden-faced toffee-named crappy acting.’

The star of Sherlock tells The Mail on Sunday's Event magazine that it is 'lazy' to treat all public school actors the same way

The 36-year-old, who was brought up in Kensington and educated at £30,000-a-year Harrow, says it is ‘lazy’ to treat all public school actors the same way.

He adds that he prefers working in the US because they are less interested in class. ‘No one minds so much over there,’ he says.

‘It’s rather about how good you are at your job. I was desperately proud of my parents for sending me to Harrow. It was a huge stretch for them. They were working actors who never knew when the next pay day might come.

‘My parents wanted the best for me. I wasn’t sent to the school my dad went to. I’m not a hereditary peer.

‘One of the best things about being an actor is that it’s a meritocracy.’

Cumberbatch, who last year threatened to leave the UK because he was sick of being seen as ‘a moaning, rich, public school bastard’, adds: ‘I’m definitely middle-class, I think.

'I know others would argue but I’m not upper-class. Upper-class to me means you are either born into wealth or you’re royalty. Okay, maybe I’m upper-middle class.’
