Mexican officials extradited the suspected drug trafficker known as the 'Queen 
of the Pacific' to the United States on Thursday.

Sandra Avila Beltran was handed over at the Toluca airport 
outside Mexico City to U.S. Marshals who took her to Miami to face federal 
cocaine-trafficking charges, the attorney general's office said.

Avila had been acquitted of similar charges in Mexico and 
her defence argued unsuccessfully that meant she should not be extradited.

'La Reina del Pacifico' (The Pacific's Queen): Sandra Avila Beltran, in September 2007, has been extradited by Mexican authorities to the U.S. She is accused of drug trafficking and conspiracy

In June, a court granted the extradition so she could face 
the charges pending in the U.S., where prosecutors allege she also had links to 
cocaine seizures in Chicago. In 2001, U.S. agents intercepted a telephone call 
in which Avila allegedly asked for payment for 220 pounds (100 kilograms) of 
cocaine delivered in Chicago.

Prosecutors allege Avila spent more than a decade working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade. She faces federal cocaine-trafficking charges now that she is in the U.S.

Federal prosecutors said the extradition request indicates 
Avila belonged to an organization that trafficked cocaine from Colombia to the 
United States. U.S. prosecutors allege she helped store and move shipments of 
the drug from Mexico to the United States.

Until Thursday, Avila had been held in a prison in Mexico's 
Pacific coast state of Nayarit, pending trial for a separate money-laundering 
charge.

It was not immediately clear how Mexican prosecutors would proceed with 
that case.

Avila, who was arrested in 2007 sipping coffee in a Mexico 
City diner, has said she is innocent.

Prosecutors have alleged that Avila spent more than a decade 
working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade. They say her romance with 
Colombian Juan Diego Espinoza brought together Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel 
with Colombia's Norte del Valle.
