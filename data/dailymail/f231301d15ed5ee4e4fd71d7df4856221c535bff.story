It is not unusual for a pet to have the run of the house and be fed tidbits from the family table.

But a horse is hardly the average household animal. Yet Mr P, a 28in-high American miniature, is right at home in owner Katy Smith’s one-bedroom flat.

And there is nothing the three-year-old likes more than settling down to afternoon tea with playmates Lilly Potter, five, and her sister, Lacey, two, the daughters of Mrs Smith’s business partner Laura Potter.

Cheeky: Miniature horse, 'Mr P' spends so much time with people that he thinks he is human

Loyal: Mr P follows owner Katy Smith, 52, everywhere. He is pictured even helping out Ms Smith by helping with the shopping

Mrs Smith, 52, says her real-life My Little Pony spends so much time indoors he thinks he is a human.

‘He’s even taken on human characteristics. Sometimes he’s like a grumpy old man other times he’s giddy like a child,’ she said. ‘One day I caught him licking tea out of my mug, so I decided to brew him his own one and he wolfed it down. Ever since I have given him tea and cake as a treat.’

Mrs Smith says house-trained Mr P has never made a mess of her flat in Middleton St George, near Darlington.

The chestnut and white horse – technically he is not a pony – follows her everywhere, even to local shops and cafes.

Relaxing: Mr P even visits cafe's with Ms Smith and enjoys a nice cup of tea

Downtime: Mr P certainly now considers himself one of the family. He is pictured watching TV

Friendly: The miniature horse plays with owner Katy Smith's friends children Lacey, 2 and Lilly, 5

‘Everyone is always amazed when they see him walking down the street,’ she said. ‘People do a double-take. But they all fall in love with him. Other horses ignore him because of his size – so he has always been drawn to humans.’

Mr P, who cost £2,000 from a specialist breeder six months ago, enjoys the outdoor life too, and happily plays with Mrs Smith’s other horse Johnny – a 5ft 3in former racehorse. Although Mr P spends the day with Mrs Smith, he has his own stable on a farm with other horses and sleeps indoors with her only when it is cold outside.

Mrs Smith and Mrs Potter run a business that provides ponies for community events. Mrs Smith, a mother of two grown-up children, also takes Mr P into care homes for the elderly as a form of therapy.

She said: 'He has enlightened my life and he helps bring joy to everyone he meets.'

And
Ms Smith says house trained Mr P has never made a mess of her 
one-bedroom flat - thanks to her bright pink bucket, which she carries 
around with them wherever they go.

She added: 'We always carry the "just in case" bucket around with us should Mr P get caught short.

'But he is so well trained he has never had an accident'.

Tiny: Standing at just 28 inches tall, the chestnut and white American miniature is dwarfed by other horses

Sweet: Wearing a fetching personalised jacket, Mr P spends a bit of time playing with a horse in the paddock

High life: Mr P is fond of a nice bit of cake washed down with a cup of tea

Afternoon out: Mr P cost Ms Smith £2,000 from a specialist breeder six months ago. The pair are pictured taking a walk in Yarm
