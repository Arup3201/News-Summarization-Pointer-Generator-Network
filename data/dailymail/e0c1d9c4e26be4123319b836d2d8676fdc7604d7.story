Target: Presenter Clare Balding was the subject of a BBC radio show quiz

Comedian Bob Mills last night said BBC producers had ‘overstepped the mark’ for asking him on a live radio programme how lesbian presenter Clare Balding could be ‘turned around’.

He blamed the production team for specifically giving him the ‘galling question’ in which he responded that women could be ‘cured’ of homosexuality.

Dozens of listeners have complained to the Corporation about the comments accusing producers of promoting homophobic bullying.

The BBC issued a second apology yesterday admitting it had ‘got it wrong’ before taking down the offending material from its internet iPlayer service.

The media regulator Ofcom said it will now assess complaints before investigating whether the programme breached ‘generally accepted standards’.

The offensive comments were made during Radio 5Live’s quiz show Fighting Talk, broadcast half an hour before the 9pm watershed on Saturday.

Host Colin Murray asked contestants, during a section called ‘Defend the Indefensible’, to argue: ‘Give me 20 minutes with her and I’m pretty sure I could turn around Clare Balding’.

Mr Mills then stated that the former jockey and racing presenter was a ‘horse woman’ who ‘appreciates power between her thighs’.

He added: ‘And we all know, there is no woman that can’t be cured’.

His response was met by loud groans from the large audience that was watching the show at the Liverpool Echo Arena as part of the station’s Big Day Out event.

Mr Mills yesterday said he ‘regretted’ the comments and felt under pressure to answer the question in 20 seconds in front of a crowd of thousands.

He added: ‘I sincerely regret any offence that was caused to people by my comments that was diametrically opposed to my beliefs. I will trust that people will understand that it was not meant to be taken seriously.

‘The production team tailor the 
questions so they are galling for the person they are asking. I don’t 
know who wrote that question and we are not told beforehand so we can 
prepare.

THE BBC is under fire for refusing to buy a retiring sports commentator a £36 bottle of bubbly because of a ban on the drink.

After facing a storm over the amount it was spending on champagne – £100,000 between 2007 and 2011 – the corporation stopped buying it and imposed a ban in 2012.

But this week the broadcaster was accused of taking the cutback too far when bosses refused to fund a  bottle bought for staff  member Brian Arrundale, who had commentated on  Hartlepool United matches for BBC Tees for 33 years.

‘I think they have overstepped the mark and maybe this will stop it happening in the future.

'I don’t know why Clare Balding was chosen for the question but she had been on the show and knows the team.’

During a later episode of the same show broadcast at 11pm, Murray asked another tawdry question involving Miss Balding.

He set as the subject for the same Defend the Indefensible debate that Channel 4 should get Miss Balding to ‘present the Derby topless’.

Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘Even as a joke, this is pretty crude and offensive banter.

'It panders to prejudice and isn’t clever or funny at all.’

Miss Balding, 42, who is the daughter of
the Queen’s former horse trainer Ian Balding, has been in a civil 
partnership with Radio 4 newsreader Alice Arnold since 2006.

Yesterday, her agent said she would not be making a comment on the remarks.

Colin Murray was contacted by the Daily Mail, but refused to comment about his remarks.

A BBC spokesman said : ‘Fighting Talk is a live programme and on this occasion we got it wrong. The “Defend the Indefensible” item was inappropriate and as such we have removed this short section of the programme from iPlayer. We would again like to apologise to anyone who was offended by the programme.’

Nicole Scherzinger used the word 'effing' before the watershed on a live X Factor show

Nicole Scherzinger’s use of the term “effing” in a live edition of The X Factor results show was unsuitable for a pre-watershed audience, according to TV regulator Ofcom.

The show judge used the word as she introduced her act - who went on to win last year’s contest - telling viewers: 'I’m so proud, this is James effing Arthur.'

Ofcom - which received 52 complaints about the incident - said it considered the term to be an example of 'offensive language' in the context of the show.

The body said a number of viewers considered it to have simply been used as a substitute for a swear word and 'as a result it was capable of causing a certain amount of offence'.

Ofcom said the use of 'effing' went beyond audience expectations for the show - which started at 8pm - and was not appropriate for a pre-watershed show which appealed to children.
