America was warned yesterday that it is within three days of tipping the rest of the world into a new global recession.

Talks to avoid the US government defaulting on its debts and to end a 14-day partial government shutdown remained deadlocked last night.

The International Monetary Fund told the US that ‘it needs to take urgent action to address the short term fiscal uncertainties’.

Managing director Christine Lagarde warned of a ‘risk of tipping, yet again, into recession’ just as some economies were recovering from the 2008 crisis.

The US defaulting on debts could shatter the fragile economic recovery, she said.

‘If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the US signature, it would mean massive disruption the world over, and we would be at risk of tipping yet again into a recession,” she told NBC.

Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, told an IMF press conference the deadlock ‘casts a long shadow over the world economy’.

President Obama wants Congress to extend his government’s borrowing authority but this is being blocked by Republicans in Congress.

If there is no deal by Thursday, there is the prospect of Washington defaulting on financial obligations.

World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said a default would be ‘disastrous’ for poorer countries. He added: The closer we get to the debt ceiling deadline, the greater the impact for the developing world.’

With Wall Street closed today for a public holiday, markets in Asia and Europe will take the first hit for the impasse.
