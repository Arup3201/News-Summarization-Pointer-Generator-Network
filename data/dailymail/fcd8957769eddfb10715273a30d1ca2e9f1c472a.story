Didier Deschamps has filed a civil law suit against Samir Nasri's girlfriend after her foul-mouthed rant about the France boss for his decision to omit the Manchester City midfielder from his World Cup squad.Â 

Anara Atanes caused a twitter-storm after tweeting 'F*** France and F*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager'.

But, even though she later apologised, Deschamps will be taking legal action against Atanes.

Trouble: Anara Atanes is facing legal action after criticising France coach Didier Deschamps

Apology: The model said she hadn't intended to offend French people, only the football management

Retiring? Nasri is considering his international future after being left out of the squad

French radio station RMC is reporting that Deschamps and the French Football Federation (FFF) have both opened legal proceedings against Atanes, who is an English-born singer from the pop group Fanfare.

'FFF condemns insulting remarks against Didier Deschamps and fully supports his coach in his approach,' read a statement released on Friday.

'The unanimous feedback confirmed that the entire France condemned such remarks. FFF believes that the unanimous indignation is enough to condemn such behaviour.'

Atanes had tweeted: 'I apologize if i offended anyone from france, My tweets were not aimed at the nation as a whole,' tweeted the Brighton-born model.

The Manchester City playmaker was surprisingly left out of coach Deschamps' 23-man squad, and even the seven on standby, when it was announced on Tuesday.

And the 26-year-old, who was also left out of the 2010 World Cup by then-coach Raymond Domenech, told Sky Sports News: 'It's a little bit hard to accept.

'I need to take some time now to think about the national team because it's been twice now that they take away a World Cup from me.

'You can go around and ask any player if they're happy to be on the bench, nobody's going to say yes.

Discontent: Brighton born Atanes has used her twitter account to criticise France and post pictures of herself

Decision: Deschamps says he left Nasri at home because he would not be content to sit on the bench

Under-fire: Deschamps has been attacked by former players and pundits for his decision on Nasri

'I need to think a little bit during the holiday, what will be my future in the national team, because missing two World Cups is really hard for a player.'

While Nasri's absence was greeted with widespread shock, the player himself said: 'I must confess, I knew before.

'Sometimes you have the feeling, when you call to speak to the manager and he doesn't want to speak to you, you know you're not going to go to the World Cup.

'It was a shock but I was prepared mentally. I'm okay.

'I respect his choice. He wanted to not pick me... good on him. I wish good luck to the French national team.'

Delight: Atanes and Nasri were celebrating just a few days ago when City clinched the title

Success: Nasri has been a crucial part of City's title winning team this season

Former France captain Patrick Vieira has expressed his surprise at Nasri's exclusion.

Vieira,
 a member of France's 1998 World Cup-winning squad when Deschamps was 
captain, has seen at first hand much of Nasri's fine campaign.

The former Arsenal captain is now the coach of the elite development squad at City.

Vieira
 tweeted: 'It is a surprise not to see @SamNasri19 on the way to Brazil.
 For me, the way he played his year would have put him on the plane.'

Deschamps defended his decision to omit Nasri, suggesting the former Arsenal star was not an ideal squad player.

'Samir is an important player for Manchester City but he has not performed that well with France,' he said.

'He is a starter at City, which is not the case with France, and he has made it clear that he is not happy when he is a substitute - and I can tell you it can be felt in the squad.'
