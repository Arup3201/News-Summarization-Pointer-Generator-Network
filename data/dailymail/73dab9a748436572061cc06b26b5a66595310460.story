A man who broke with tradition and decided to take his wife's last name when they married is fighting to get his driving license back after it was suspended when he was accused of fraud.

Lazaro Sopena, from South Florida, offered to change his name following his 2011 marriage to wife Hanh Dinh in order to fulfill her wish to continue her Vietnamese family surname.

Shortly after their marriage, Mr Dinh ordered a new passport and Social Security card and changed his bank account and credit cards before applying to update his drivers license.

'It was an act of love. I have no particular emotional ties to my last name,' said Mr Dinh, 40, who was born in Cuba and moved to the United States at the age of 11 in 1984.

Just as is the case for newlywed women Mr Dinh was initially issued a new license after presenting his marriage certificate and paying a $20 fee.

'It was easy. When the government issues you a new passport you figure you're fine,' he said.

Mr Dinh ordered a new passport and Social Security card and changed his bank account and credit cards before applying to update his drivers license. A year later he was told he had obtained it 'by fraud'

But just over a year later, in December, Dinh received a letter from Florida's Department of Motor Vehicles accusing him of 'obtaining a driving license by fraud' and advising him that his license would be suspended at the end of the month.

Ironically, it was addressed to Lazaro Dinh.

He said he assumed it was a mistake but when he called the state DMV office in Tallahassee he said he was told he had to go to court first in order to change his name legally, a process that takes several months and has a $400 filing fee.

When he explained he was changing his name due to marriage, he was told 'that only works for women,' he said.

'Apparently the state of Florida clings to the out-dated notion that treats women as an extension of a man,' said Lazaro's lawyer, Spencer Kuvin, with Cohen & Kuvin in West Palm Beach.

While it was unusual for a man to seek to be considered an extension on his wife, Dinh's case raised important issues for gay marriage, he noted.

'If Lazaro isn't allowed to change his name, what is going to happen when a gay couple seeks a name change?'

Only a few states have made their marriage name change policy gender neutral, Kuvin said. In Florida's case it has no law, although the DMV's website does not specify gender.

According to Kuvin, 9 states enable a man to change his name upon marriage: California, New York, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Oregon, Iowa, Georgia and North Dakota.

The Florida DMV did not respond to a request for comment.

Following a DMV hearing, Dinh was issued a Final Order on January 14 confirming that his license had been properly suspended for fraud.

He is now appealing that order but has not dared get behind the wheel.

'I don't understand. I'm being treated like a highway criminal,' said Dinh, who said he has a perfect driving record and now is struggling to carry out his job, begging his wife and friends for rides.
