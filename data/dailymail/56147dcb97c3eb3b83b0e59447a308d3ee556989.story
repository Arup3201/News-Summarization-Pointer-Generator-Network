Patients with a severe type of arthritis associated with the skin condition psoriasis now have access to a drug that can ease pain and inflammation within a week.

Cimzia has just been licensed for NHS patients with psoriatic arthritis. It is given to them as an injection and can be self-administered.

Approximately 156,000 people in England and Wales suffer from the condition.

A recent trial showed the medication rapidly improved joint swelling and skin symptoms in patients who were experiencing mild to severe psoriasis.

About 10 to 20 per cent of the 1.8 million people in the UK with psoriasis go on to develop psoriatic arthritis, usually around ten years after the onset of skin problems.

Stiffness in the back or neck and swelling of fingers or toes is often seen and in the worst cases joints fuse.

Jo Cumming, Head of Information and Helplines at Arthritis Care, explains: ‘Some patients develop the arthritic symptoms before the psoriasis, while others never develop the skin condition.

Jo Cumming, head of information and helplines at Arthritis Care explained that psoriatic arthritis could be hard to diagnose

'It can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms may be similar to those experienced by those with other forms of arthritis.’

Cimzia is an anti-tumour necrosis factor drug (anti-TNF).

According to Consultant Rheumatologist, Dr Stefan Siebert, Senior Lecturer in Rheumatology at the University of Glasgow, it works by targeting one of the molecules involved in causing joint inflammation.

‘TNF is an inflammatory protein that circulates in the joints and causes damage over time. An anti-TNF sticks to it and disables it, stopping it going into the cells.

'Cimzia has an extra ‘peg’ side chain attached to it, which makes it work for longer.

‘Patients seem to have a quick and effective response, which is a huge positive to someone living with the emotional and psychological effects brought on by psoriatic arthritis.

‘We’re beginning to understand more about the genetics of this condition, and several new drugs are in the pipeline.’
