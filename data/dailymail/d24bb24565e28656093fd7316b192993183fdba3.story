She played forthright Nessa in the hit series Gavin & Stacey and it seems Welsh actress and writer Ruth Jones is as plain-spoken as the man-eating trucker in real life,

The star of Sky One's comedy, Stella, 48, has spoken out against having procedures to prevent signs of ageing saying that the injections won't stop time catching up with any of us.

Ruth, who lost four and a half stone in 2011, stayed tight-lipped about her transformation in an interview with The Times but she admitted the thought of  Botox injections makes her shudder.

She said: 'I'd never judge anyone who did Botox, it's a personal thing. But I wouldn't do it.

'You're either going to have lines or you're going to have a strange, flat forehead. Either way, you're not going to look like you did when you were 25, so I'm going for the lines. 

'None of us are going to get younger, there's no point in trying to chase that dream because it won't happen. And I'm too queasy. The thought of putting needles into my forehead... I have facials and I love spas, but that's more about the pampering.'

Ruth, who lives in Cardiff with her husband David Peet, slimmed down her physique after years of faddy diets through old fashioned calorie counting.

As Nessa, the actress made a virtue of her size 24 curves and a fuller figure was essential for her critically acclaimed role as Hattie Jacques in BBC 4 drama Hattie. She even came to fame in the diet comedy drama Fat Friends, which ran from 2000 to 2005.

She has previously talked about her weight loss, saying:  ‘I came back from holiday a couple of years ago – January 2010, and we all overdo it on holiday, don’t we? Something just clicked, I felt this is now or never, I wanted to make a positive change for me, and I haven’t looked back.'

Now Ruth is a keen jogger who recently completed a 10K.

Meanwhile, she paid tribute to her Gavin & Stacey co-creator James Corden who she describes as 'utterly outrageous' and always having everyone in stitches.

The fourth series of her comedy drama Stella, in which she plays a single mum working as a nurse, is about to return to Sky TV.
