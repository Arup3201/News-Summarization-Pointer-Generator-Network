Police are hunting a teenage mother who is accused of abducting her toddler daughter, aged one-year-old, from her foster parents and promptly vanished.

West Midlands Police are now hunting for the mother and the child, because of serious concerns about the baby's welfare.

The authorities became concerned when the missing child, Lola Page, disappeared during a supervising visit in Willenhall in the West Midlands.

Mother Stacey Ball, 18, of Walsall Wood, is believed to have gotten into a dark-coloured car with her child, and then drove off, leaving the address.

Since the child disappeared, no sightings of the child have been reported, according to police.

A police spokesman said at the time of her disappearance Lola was under the care of social services, and had been placed with a foster family.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Markham, of West Midlands Police, said: 'There haven't been any sightings of Stacey or Lola since they went missing and both police and the local authority are extremely worried about their welfare.

'Lola was in the care of social services at the time of her disappearance and we urgently need Stacey to make contact with us or anyone who may know their whereabouts.'

Lola has been described by police as white with short straight blonde hair, and was wearing a white cardigan and blue polka dot dress when she was taken.

Ms Ball is described as white, of thin build and was wearing a long black wig, black leggings and a black and tan patterned dress when she left with her daughter.

The force has released a photograph of mother and daughter which was taken on the day they went missing, and a different photograph showing her with long blonde hair.
