Tapes from the 911 calls made to police which led to them investigating a suspicious incident at a Miami hotel involving three professional footballers have been released.

The recordings come after an unidentified woman went to Miami Police headquarters two days after the calls were made to say she had been partying with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, along with receiver Quinton Patton and Seattle Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette.

The woman said she kissed Kaepernick and undressed after a night of drinking and smoking marijuana with him and two others. She adds that she later woke up in hospital without any memory. Mr Kaepernick has denied any wrongdoing.

The police report also notes that she had a 'sexual relationship with Mr Kaepernick in the past'.

Now the tapes of the calls have been revealed, showing that two unidentified men made two separate 911 calls on the night of April 1.

In the first call, a man identifying himself as hotel security tells the operator a woman, who called herself ‘Jesus’ was in a hotel room and was refusing to leave.

ABC News reported that the caller said: ‘She said her name was Jesus and she don’t have no clothes on. She is visiting this gentleman here.’

Meanwhile in a second call, the website said the unidentified male said: ‘There’s a young lady in my friend’s bed. She says she’s not leaving until she sees him... No, no, he's not her boyfriend. He's someone she wants to sleep with.’

The incident, which occurred last month at the Viceroy Hotel in Miami, is being treated as suspicious by police although they have not called it a criminal investigation and do not have a timeline for any updates.

After the incident was reported and Mr Kaepernick’s name appeared in a police report, the quarter back took to Twitter to defend himself after it was said he was being investigated for sexual assault.

He tweeted: ‘The charges made in the TMZ story and other stories I’ve seen are completely wrong. They make things up about me that never happened.

'I take great pride in who I am and what I do, but I guess sometimes you have to deal with someone who makes things up.

'I want to thank all of the people who have shared their encouraging sentiments. I assure you that your faith is not misplaced.'

A police spokesperson said: 'There's no evidence of a crime or a sexual assault. This report is simply an incident report taken at the woman's request.'
