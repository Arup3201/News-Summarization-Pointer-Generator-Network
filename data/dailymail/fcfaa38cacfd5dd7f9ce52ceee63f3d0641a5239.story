Anyone interested in buying a piece of Rob Ford history now has a chance. 

The notorious former Toronto mayor and now city councilor is auctioning off some of the memorabilia he has collected over the years, including what appears to be the football tie he wore when he admitted to smoking crack cocaine. 

In the eBay description, Ford said the tie is the 'only one of these in existence' and features logos from NFL teams past and present.
