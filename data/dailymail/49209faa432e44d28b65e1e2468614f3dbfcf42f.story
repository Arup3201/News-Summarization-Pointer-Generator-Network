A woman screamed 'I'm going to die' when she was impaled on a cathedral's spiked gate after tripping on a cobbled road while on a night out.

Yvonne Baker, 30, was walking past Rochester Cathedral in Kent last June when she tripped and fell towards the metal gate.

Witnesses told how they heard Ms Baker scream 'I’m going to die' as one of the four-inch spikes pierced her upper right arm.

Firefighters had to cut her free from the spikes before she was taken to hospital, where doctors fought to save her arm.

The spikes were removed from Chertsey's Gate after the accident and have been redesigned to incorporate smooth, rounded tips - making them safer for pedestrians.

The new set of spikes, designed by a specialist blacksmith, were installed this week.

At the time of the accident, Ms Baker, a construction site manager from Borstal, Kent,warned that the spikes could fatally injure someone.

She said: 'What would happen if a child falls on it or an elderly person tripped? Someone could die.

'Doing what I do for a living with risk assessment and health and safety, I’m surprised they are still there.

Concern: The Dean of Rochester, the Very Rev Dr Mark Beach (pictured left), said staff had been saddened to hear about Ms Baker’s 'horrible accident'. Right: The original spikes pictured to the left of the archway

'More than anything, I want it removed before it happens to someone else.'

The Dean of Rochester, the Very Rev Dr Mark Beach, said staff had been saddened to hear about Ms Baker’s 'horrible accident'.

He said: 'The lady suffered an awful injury. But we are pleased with the good outcome.

'We have restored the remaining spikes and have saved a piece of Rochester’s history, in a safe way.'
