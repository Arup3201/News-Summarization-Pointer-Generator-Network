Wantroba will be suspended without pay for the rest of this school year, at which point the district will have the authority to make the final decision as to whether or not to reinstate him

A middle school physical education teacher has won a reprieve over a prank involving a pair of purple panties that almost cost him his job.

In February, Raymond Wantroba, a teacher at Lyons Creek Middle School in Coconut Creek, Florida, admitted to placing the women's underwear in a student's locker after initially denying having anything to do with it.

The Broward School Board recommended in April that Wantroba should be fired, but a state administrative law judge has now ruled that that punishment was too severe.

According to the judge’s ruling, Wantroba will be suspended without pay for the rest of this school year, at which point the district will have the authority to make the final decision regarding whether or not to reinstate him.

The judge said he was persuaded to give Wantroba leniency based on the ‘remorse expressed,’ his more than 25 years as an educator and ‘the isolated nature of the conduct at issue.’

The district had cited immorality, misconduct in office and insubordination in its recommendation to fire him, reports the Sun Sentinel.

Back in February, the physical education teacher confiscated a pair of women’s underwear - described as ‘lacy, purple panties’ - from some students, took a picture with them, and placed them in a student’s locker.

When the student opened his locker and discovered the panties, a group of 30 or 40 other students witnessed it and started to laugh.

Wantroba reportedly also laughed at the student and made fun of him for having the underwear.The student reported the incident to his mother, who in turn took her son to the assistant principal.

During a school district investigation, Wantroba admitted to everything.

While the state administrative law judge called Wantroba's behavior ‘inexcusable,’ he said only misconduct could be proved.

He wrote that Wantroba said, 'he did not intend to hurt any student and was remorseful for his behavior.'
