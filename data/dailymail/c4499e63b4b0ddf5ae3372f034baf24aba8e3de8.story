Treasury minister Danny Alexander vowed to end the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role

Redundancy payouts given to NHS managers are to be clawed back if workers get a new job in the health service.

The Treasury vowed to end the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role.

But the move was dismissed as ‘too little, too late’ after 4,000 have already been rehired and it emerged staff will be able to keep the cash if they wait for a year before taking up a new post.

Under new rules announced by the Treasury, the law will be changed so that anyone earning more than £100,000 who returns to the same part of public sector within 12 months of taking redundancy will have to return all or part of their pay-off.

It is expected the measure - which is included in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill currently going through Parliament - will mainly affect NHS and local government administrators.

The Treasury said that of the 19,000 NHS administrators made redundant between 2010 and 2013, almost 20 per cent rejoined the NHS while 16 per cent of local government chief executives who left by mutual agreement between 2007 and 2009 had been employed by another council within a year.

In March it emerged that almost 4,000 NHS staff given redundancy pay-offs as part of the coalition’s health shake-up had been rehired.

More than one in six managers and administrators given payouts worth as much as £650,000 were back working in the health service.

Chris Leslie MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to Treasury, said the proposed legislation was only coming after the Coalition had spent four years squandering large sums on the pay-offs despite promising a crackdown.

He said: ‘Ministers could have acted on this years ago before they wasted millions of pounds firing and then rehiring staff.

‘In the NHS alone, the government’s reckless reorganisation has seen £1.6 billion spent on redundancies.

‘Over 4,000 NHS managers - some of whom received pay-offs over £200,000 - have been fired and rehired under this government.’

The new regulations will be included in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill currently going through Parliament.

Almost all of the public sector will be covered by the measures, including the Civil Service, local government and the NHS.

Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘It’s only fair that highly-paid executives who receive a redundancy pay-out from the public purse and then quickly return to the same part of the public sector repay the taxpayer.

‘Reforming the public sector so it works for Britain has been a key part of this government’s drive to create a stronger economy and fairer society.”

The total cost to the NHS of ‘revolving door’ payments has not been revealed but with the average redundancy payment being £48,000, it could mean almost £200million has been squandered on pay-offs for returning staff since 2010.

Family affair: Karen Straughair and husband Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust

Non-clinical staff have received average pay-offs of £43,000 but 2,300 received six-figure deals.

They include a husband-and-wife team of NHS managers who walked away with £1million in combined redundancies straight into six-figure salary posts.

Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March 2013.

Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished.

By June last year both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director.
