The exchange covered the professional as well as the personal, with Sasi poking fun at the fact that Fassnidge's restaurant Four in Hand was stripped of a coveted 'hat', relegated to one hat status.

Sasi said that Fassnidge could try as hard as he wanted to justify the loss, but that he 'still lost a hat, f**ked we laughed so hard at the awards when u were in the 1 hats.'

Fassnidge told the Sunday Telegraph that the doesn't like Sasi and claims the feud started a few months ago because he tried to take some of his chefs.

He told the Telegraph that : 'I just don't like the guy'. 

'I think he's a good cook but I can't have any respect for a guy who tries to steal other people's staff.'  

He said in the interview that the battle had begun light-heartedly but then it Sasi started making personal remarks about Fassnidge's wife and children.

'I've seen your wife you probably need some stimulation, I'll DM you some pictures of attractive women,' Sasi tweeted.

Fassnidge fired back asking for a photo of Sasi's mother.

Sasi labelled Fassnidge a coward for hiding behind social media, calling him a 'bully' and explaining that he decided against deleting the Twitter exchange because 'I want people to see what he is like'.
