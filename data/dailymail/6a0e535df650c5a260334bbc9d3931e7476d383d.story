Strike two: Marilyn Hagerty, 88, reviewed Olive Garden and has now given her account of Applebee's

Hagerty branded Olive Garden the 'largest and most beautiful restaurant in town' when the casual Italian outlet arrived in the small town of Grand Forks, North Dakota.

The article for the Grank Forks Herald went viral, landing the grandmother a book deal and numerous TV appearances.

In her latest piece, Applebees: A Salad To Remember, Hagerty described a more sedate eating experience at the bar and grill which has 2,019 restaurants globally.

She describes the Chicken Oriental Salad as 'one of those things you remember' - but that is where the praise ends.

Readers wishing to try the dish, she warns, should opt for the $8.59 half-size version: 'The regular size is $9.99, but you don't need that.'

She also turned up the chance to try their Blue Ribbon Brownies - which she 'could do without'.

Instead, she opted for a 'small, gooey' Dessert Shooter, which she praised as: 'just right'. 

'Neighborhood feel': She is sparing with adjectives but seems to commend the atmosphere of the eatery

'One of those things you remember': Hagerty enjoyed and remembered the half-sized Chicken Oriental Salad

Special mention goes to her waitress, Miguela: 'None of this, “Hi, I’m Nick, and I will be your server.”

'She was there when we needed her. She did not intrude.'

And Mary Lou Kurtyka, who greets diners at the door, 'fits the neighborhood theme promoted by the restaurant'.

An astute investigator, Hagerty gleaned some inside knowledge on how staff are trained at the eatery.

She was - as ever - sparing with adjectives, but her tone suggested she approved.

'They don’t come around asking if everything is all right,' she wrote, 'instead, one of the managers said they are encouraged to show their own personalities.'

Finally, Hagerty issues the restaurant with a report card:

'Seating usually is quick in booths or at tables with windows all around. Service is good.

'Menu is extensive and takes study if you are not a regular here. Rest rooms are good.'

It retains the same pensive tone of Hagerty's renowned Olive Garden review, but falls short of receiving her praise.

'Just right': The 'small and gooey' Dessert Shooter hit the spot for Hagerty and her companion

Shunned: She decided they could 'do without' the Blue Ribbon Brownies on offer at the restaurant

She started off her Olive Garden review by calling the eatery 'impressive', so impressive people were queuing around the block to eat there last month.

But no need for diners to worry, the 85-year-old matter-of-factly points out: 'There is seating for those who are waiting.'

She describes the decor as being 'fashioned in Tuscan farmhouse style with a welcoming entryway'.

After asking the server 'at length' what she would recommend Mrs Hagerty decided to take her advice on the Chicken Alfredo, though chose a glass of water rather than the recommended raspberry lemonade.

Though she later told readers: 'On a hot summer day, I will try the raspberry lemonade that was recommended.'

While waiting for her food, the writer took the time to absorb her surroundings, describing the staff's standard white-shirt, black pants uniform and accompanying 'gold-coloured towels' that 'adorned their aprons'.

As for the food: 'The server first brought me the familiar Olive Garden salad bowl with crisp greens, peppers, onion rings and yes — several black olives.

'Along with it came a plate with two long, warm breadsticks.

'The chicken Alfredo ($10.95) was warm and comforting on a cold day. The portion was generous. My server was ready with Parmesan cheese.'

After acknowledging that the restaurant had a fully-licensed bar, a fireplace that 'added warmth' and that vases with permanent flower displays, i.e. plastic, sat on the ledges, she concludes that Olive Garden is 'the largest and most beautiful restaurant now operating in Grand Forks'.

The pinnacle: Hagerty branded Olive Garden 'the lagrest and most beautiful restaurant' in Grand Forks

Praise: The meal was 'warm and comforting on a cold day', Hagerty gushed to readers in North Dakota 

The restaurant does not need to rely on the town of 55,000 people for business as Mrs Hagerty points out: 'It attracts visitors from out of town as well as people who live here.'

Speaking to ABC about her new-found fame, Mrs Hagerty said: 'Yesterday morning the phone started ringing and messages started going up, and I had no clue what it was all about.

'These people were making fun of me…and then I thought, so what? My son told me that it had gone viral but I didn’t know what that meant.

'It’s been like a three ring circus over here ever since.'

When one blogger asked a former Grand Forks Herald editor if Mrs Hagerty was sincere in her earnest review, he said: 'Oh, that's for real. Marilyn has been reviewing restaurants for the Herald for decades. She also writes a sort of celebrity column and has a sewage lift station named for her, as does Dave Barry.

'By the way, her readers will recognize that as a fairly negative reviewsince she spent a lot more time on the ambiance than the food.'

Even outspoken chef Anthony Bourdain is a fan, tweeting to his followers today: 'Very much enjoying watching Internet sensation Marilyn Hagerty triumph over the snarkologists (myself included).'
