A Texas man with a history of violent crime and a collection of bizarre tattoos marring his face has been declared incompetent to stand trial after being accused of stabbing a 3-year-old boy.

Jose Guillermo Molina, 21, has been charged with felony injury to a child in connection with the April stabbing of the boy outside a northwest Houston apartment complex.

Police say Molina crept up behind victim Emmanuel Volez in the complex's common area before seizing the boy and throwing him to the floor, ABC 13 reports.

The victim's mother said Molina then pressed his knee into her son's back and began stabbing him with a kitchen knife.

'He grabbed the little boy by his hair, pulled the neck back, stabbed him
 in the neck three times,' neighbor Lydia Hernandez told 
Click2Houston. 'After he stabbed him, he put the little boy on the ground and put his knee on the little boy's chest and he was trying to choke him.'

KHOU reports that police arrested Molina shortly after the attack at a shopping center across the road.

Molina reportedly lived in the same complex as the young victim.

The boy has been released from the hospital and is now home recovering.

Fittingly, police say Molina was often called 'cucuy,' which means 'monster' in Spanish, reports The Huffington Post.

True to the name, Molina's face is heavily tattooed, with a Happy Face inked dully on one cheek and a fading bunny on the other, along with at least half-a-dozen other faded images.

Authorities say they don't understand why Molina attacked the boy and he will be evaluated in a psychiatric hospital for 180 days

This is also at least the second time Molina has appeared in court for a violent crime.

He has a previous conviction for attacking his own mother.

The court ordered him to 180 days in a psychiatric hospital, at the end of which he will be reevaluated.
