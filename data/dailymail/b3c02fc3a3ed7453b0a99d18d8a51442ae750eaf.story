For years, experts wondered how Stonehenge was built and where it's famous stones came from - now a chunk of the area widely thought to have provided the famous rocks has gone on the market for £2million.

The parcel of 577 acres of Fyfield and Overton Downs near Marlborough, Wiltshire which is up for sale is part of the landscape from which Neolithic people extracted the stones to make the 5,000-year-old monument.

The land still contains hundreds of 'sarcen stones' - known locally as grey wethers due to their resemblance to hillside sheep - which were mysteriously transferred 25 miles south in around 2,600BC.

The sale of the land is being described by estate agents as 'a truly unique opportunity to acquire a protected landscape steeped in history'.

A 577-acre slice of the Fyfield and Overton Downs near Marlborough, Wiltshire has gone on sale, dotted with 'sarcen stones' like those used to make Stonehenge around 5,000 years ago

The 'sarcen stones' scattered over the site are believed to have named using the Anglo Saxon terms 'sar', meaning troublesome, and 'stan', meaning stone, due to the problems they caused for farmers

The land is designated as a Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which means it is carefully protected by authorities and has strict rules on development.

It does however come with its own racehorse track - known as the Manton Derby Gallop - and a three bedroom cottage called The Delling, which estate agents say is 'in need of substantial renovation'.

The gallop is so named, despite being straight, as it was previously used as a trial gallop in the weeks before the Epson Derby.

The cottage, which is 915 square feet and comprises two reception rooms, a kitchen and bathroom has a mains water supply but has been empty for 30 years.

The area is said be excellent for pheasant and partridge shooting and one writer has described the surrounding downs as 'one of the most glorious areas for walking in Wiltshire'.

The estimated 35 acres of woodland which comes with the land contains two drives for shooting and three game pens.

The area of land is said to contain one the best collections of sarcen stones in Britain and is loved by walkers

The land's most unique feature however is the thousands of sarcen stones which scatter the hills and landscape.

The word 'sarsen' has been suggested to have come from the Anglo Saxon terms 'sar', meaning troublesome and 'stan', meaning stone, because of the hindrance they posed to agriculture.

Stonehenge was built using two types of stone - sarcen stones, which are believed to have been brought from Fyfield and Overton Downs - and 'bluestones', which are believed to have been transported, by sea, from south-west Wales.

The exact method of transportation is still disputed, but most archaeologists believe they were moved using water networks before being hauled over land on sledges.

It is thought a ditch and bank were created at Stonehenge around 3000BC and it was used as a burial ground. 

The cottage, set in the area of woodland, is about three miles from the town of Marlborough and 15 miles from Swindon

The bluestones were brought there around 2600BC and placed in two circles. The sarcen stones were then mined from the area around Marlborough 200 years later.

Neolithic people are thought to have believed the stones had supernatural or healing power and were prepared to go to extreme lengths to harness them.

A number of myths surround the site. One the of earliest originated in the 12th century in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of the Kings of Britain, which claims the wizard Merlin brought the stones from Ireland using magic.

Another myth claimed the Devil brought them across the Irish sea, after tricking an old woman by telling her he would pay her as much money as she could count while he gathered up the stones.

She thought the task would take a long time and that she would be as ‘rich as a princess’. But, the legend goes, the Devil tricked her, for as soon as she started counting the money he quickly bundled up the stones and vanished.

Stonehenge is often associated with Druids, but English Heritage have said there is no evidence to suggest they built or carried out ceremonies at the site.

The downland provides pasture for livestock and the property comes with a licence to graze and mow until February 2015

Overton Down and the adjacent Fyfield Down have been described as 'one of the most glorious areas for walking in Wiltshire'

Numerous ancient trackways run across Overton Down, one of which leads from the Avebury circle, another ancient monument, to the market town of Marlborough
