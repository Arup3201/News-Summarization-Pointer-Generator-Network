The Great British Bake Off is back for a fifth series, with 7.2 million baking enthusiasts up and down the country tuning in for the first episode last night.

And bookies are already hedging their bets on this year's rising stars, who include youngest ever contestant Martha Collison, 17, and 31-year-old speech therapist Claire Goodwin.

Coral's current favourite to win at 3/1 is grandmother 
of eight Nancy Birtwhisle who took the prized title of Star Baker for her 'Jaffa cakes' yesterday.

Coral's current favourite to win Bake Off at 3/1 is grandmother of eight, Nancy Birtwhisle

The keen baker, 60, from Barton-Upon-Humber, whipped up her incredible cake using a recipe that put even McVitie's to
 shame.

It consisted of 'vanilla sponge, sandwiched with Cointreau orange jelly topped 
with dark chocolate, and handmade orange pastilles.'

She even used a homemade cake guillotine to ensure precise symmetry.

The former practice manager at Central Surgery in Barton discovered a passion for baking after retiring seven years ago.

She was selected as a contestant for this year's series after a failed application last year, and is one of 12 amateurs looking to impress judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood.

Hot on her heels to win the baking contest, which has moved from BBC2 to BBC1, is Richard the builder at 7/2.

Youngest contestant ever at just 17, Martha Collison is next with odds of 5/1. 

Meanwhile, poor Claire Goodwin was the first to exit, Coral now have the colourfully attired Jordan Cox at 5/4 as the next baker to leave as he failed to impress the judges. 

It wouldn't be a Bake Off without tears and tantrums and following the debut episode, Coral is offering odds of 2/1 of at least three contestants welling up by the third episode.

Although it's the baking disaster cake lovers fear the most, the phrase 'soggy bottom' comes a close second. 

It was used in jest last night but Coral offers odds at 7/4 that it will be used to describe a contestant's creation by the third episode. 

Dressed in a splendid floral design for episode one, It's odds on at 1/2 that Mary Berry will sport a floral blazer at least four times throughout the series.

Coral's John Hill says: 'The new series, although predictable, continues to receive rave reviews and shows no signs of falling flat, promising the usual helping of one-liners from Mel and Sue and dollops of innuendo from Paul and Mary, but all eyes will be on the contestants' clever creations over the coming weeks. 

'At this stage we're backing Nancy to win, although as we all know, this can easily change with a "soggy bottom"!'
