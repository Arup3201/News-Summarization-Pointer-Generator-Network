Three men dressed as ninjas were caught Wednesday on surveillance restraining the owner of a multimillion-dollar home while they stole valuables.

Bill Kitchen, 65, and Camil Espinel, 42, were tied up in his $4.5million home while the disguised thieves ransacked the home for nearly an hour. Neither was harmed during the ordeal, but one of their cars was stolen.

The pair was first accosted by the two men in the home’s garage and then led inside by the three men holding weapons, police told WFTV. The robbers demanded money, jewelry and other valuables.

A photo from the surveillance footage shows Kitchen tied up in what appears to be a home office while one of the crooks wears one of Espinel’s hats.

‘Our home security shows me (hands bound behind me) in the office, pointing out the valuables. Camilo is sitting, also bound, with his head in a pillow case,’ Kitchen wrote Facebook.

‘One of the three robbers (in black Ninja suits) found Camilo's hat, and is wearing it. In the second pic, the robber sees the video camera.’

A MailOnline attempt to obtain a list of stolen items and the weapons used from Windermere Police was not successful.

‘We were asked to produce all money, jewelry and valuables,’ he wrote in the post. ‘For an hour they ransacked the house.’

The trio then made off in one a car owned by one of the bound men, Kitchen added.

‘It's very scary. I'm hoping that it was an isolated incident like they're saying it was and that it wasn't random and that we have nothing to worry about,’ neighbour DeeDee Lee told WKMG.

Police also have not said what make or model car was taken, but did note it was found nearby.

‘Although this is frightening to happen in our community, I believe this to be an isolated incident, said police chief David Ogden.

Kitchen’s wealth comes from founding a roller coaster design company based in Orlando, according to various reports.

The pillaged home is worth just under $4.6million, according to Zillow.

He has not spoken publicly about the incident, but his son released a statement to WESH saying ‘he is holding up quite well considering the circumstances.’

Windermere is the exclusive community where golfer Tiger Woods and ex-wife Elin Nordegren once lived prior to their divorce.

The investigation remains ongoing.
