Gutted: Eileen Remedios begged the thief to return her bicycle after it was stolen from outside a patient's house

Nurse Eileen Remedios was 'gutted' when her beloved bicycle was stolen from outside a patient's house who she had been visiting.

But after leaving a tongue-in-cheek note attached to a lamppost begging for its safe return, the 55-year-old had her faith in humanity restored when the thief returned her trusty two wheels along with a humble note of apology.

The gesture amazed Ms Remedious, who has now struck up a written relationship with the mysterious, yet 'sweet bike borrower'.

Ms Remedios, of Brighton in East Sussex, said: 'I
 was feeling quite cross. I thought "why would someone want to take my 
old bike?" I thought maybe someone was drunk and had borrowed it.

'But I never imagined that someone would bring it back. It really has restored my faith in humanity.'

In her frustration, she wrote a note and stuck it to a nearby lamppost saying: 'Please return my bike. It is old but loved and will be frightened without its owner.'

When she returned to the patient's home the following day, she found her bike had been returned along with a note of apology from the reformed thief, which had been stuffed under the doormat of the patient she was visiting.

The biked had been chained to a lamppost and with the keys left inside the envelope.

The envelope was addressed to 'The owner of the old blue bike.'

Inside, a note read: 'A great big fat...SORRY! From the reformed bike thief! (I didn’t mistreat it).'

Begging: Ms Remedios wrote this note to and pinned it to a lamppost near the home she had been visiting

Amazed: The following day she returned to find her bike chained up and this note of apology

Trusty: Ms Remedios's bicycle had little monetary value, but she was attached to it nonetheless

Ms Remedios has now written back to say: 'To the sweet bike borrower. Thanks for returning my bike. She had a nice time but is delighted to be back with me.'

She later added: 'The bike hasn’t got much value but it was given to me by an old friend and gets me from A to B.

'It was a real inconvenience when it disappeared. Everyone can relate to having a bike stolen, it’s gutting.

'The note certainly worked and I wanted to share a good story with a nice ending.

'Who am I to question why, but I am delighted to have my old blue bike back with me.'
