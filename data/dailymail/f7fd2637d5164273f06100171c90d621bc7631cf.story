It's the ideal solution for commuters - a full size bicycle which fits into a bag and is assembled in less than ten minutes.

Commuters struggling to fit their fold-up bikes on trains will instead be able to carry a normal-sized bike to work with them in a small backpack the size of a tyre.

On arrival, all they need to do is attach the various aluminium hollow tubes together from simple twist joints - including the wheels.

Commuter's dream:  This full-size prototype bicycle fits into a bag and is assembled in under ten minutes

And the chain is different to most bikes in that it uses a rubber belt drive system reinforced with carbon, while to brake you simply stop pedalling.

Amit Mirchandani, a creative director at Indian creative agency Lucid Design, helped come up with the design because he wanted to make a full-size but compact carrying bike.

The result is the Kit Bike - designed to take out the awkward nature of fold-up bikes.

Mr Mirchandani, 35, said: 'Conventional bikes are awkward in every way except when you ride them.

Storage: Each wheel is stored in a separate section of the bag, separate from the remaining 19 parts

A rival design to the Kit Bike is the origami bike that can fold into a package the size as an umbrella.

An Italian designed has revealed the bike, which even has folding wheels, and a hub instead of a chain.

However, despite its tiny size when folded, it still boast full size 26inch wheels and can even be folded in a single move.

Inventor Gianluca Sada says he first came up with the idea after being disappointed with current folding bike designs.

'The idea of a folding bike has undertaken numerous studies that focus on reducing the weight and dimensions which have led, to too small sized bicycles,' he said. 

After dozens of prototypes, he developed the current bike, which includes wheels with no spokes, and a design small enough to be used as a backpack.

'The project may pave the way for a new system of mobility outside the classical schemes, widely accessible and easily transportable,' he explains.

'We thought what if there was a bike that was so small, it fit into a bag you could carry as a backpack?

'What if when you assembled the bike, you got a full-size bike that was comfortable to ride?

'We felt we could make one simple, minimal and cool - unlike folding bikes that tend to be complex in their engineering and construction.

'The Kit Bike was designed to do all these things and make problems of shipping and travelling with a bike a thing of the past.'

The Kit Bike consists of simple twist joints that lock with aluminium hollow tubes using a specially designed key.

The entire bike can be assembled from the leather bag or dismantled from one side making the process extremely simple and quick.

Each wheel is stored in a separate section of the bag, while the remaining 19 parts caters for the hollow tubing, seat, handlebars and chain.

Mr Mirchandani, from Bangalore, India, said: 'Assembly and disassembly would take 10 minutes or less.

'At the moment it's still a prototype so we are not sure how much it will be to buy but it should weight similar to most aluminium bikes.'
