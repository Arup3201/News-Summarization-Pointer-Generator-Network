ABC news correspondent Amy Robach has revealed that her cancer has spread to her lymph nodes.

In a letter to fans published today, the 40-year-old journalist says that when receiving a double mastectomy earlier this month, doctors discovered a second, undetected malignant tumor.

However, Ms Robach remains optimistic  saying that the cancer did not spread beyond her second sentinel node, and that while she 'will have more treatments ahead...' none of them will take her out of work.

Ms Robach's letter, which was posted to ABC's website, made her appear incredibly positive.

'It may be cold and gloomy outside today but it is warm and sunny in my world,' she said about her surgery's aftermath.

Ms Robach says that 'physically and emotionally I have been through the ringer, but I am emerging on the other side so much stronger. I have a greater appreciation for life, for health and for how such simple acts of kindness can be so incredibly powerful.'

Her cancer diagnosis, which she received two weeks ago after receiving an on-the-air mammogram to raise awareness for breast cancer, has given her a different outlook on life.

'I am looking through a different lens now…and I am thankful for that as well,' she wrote in the letter.  'There was my life before October 30th and now my life after.'

Good Morning America anchor and fellow breast cancer survivor Robin Roberts has been in contact with Ms Robach.

'Amy is doing well, thank you for asking,' Ms Roberts told Closer at the Reeve Foundation Gala on Thursday night.

She
 continued, saying: 'Just how it all happened has us still reeling. But 
she's home from the hospital, we've been talking with her, she's eager 
to continue working as much as she can through the long process, but 
she's in great spirits and the surgery went well and we can't wait to 
have her back.'

Robach noted in her letter that she expects to return back to work on December 2 - a date that will not be altered by her ongoing treatments.

Research by the Susan G. Komen Foundation says that women with 1-3 cancerous lymph nodes like Ms Roback show a five-year relative 87% survival rate

'I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work,' she wrote.

Robach, a mother of two, was given her shocking diagnosis after being asked by a GMA producer in September if she would take a mammogram live on air to raise awareness for breast cancer for their 'GMA Goes Pink' day.

She reluctantly agreed - and it was a decision that saved her life. On October 1, in front of millions of people, Robach took her mammogram, breathing a sigh of relief when it was over.

A few weeks later, she was asked to come back to the doctors and was so unconcerned, she didn't even bring anyone with her.

'I thought I was going back in for a 
few follow-up images, only to find out in a matter of hours that I had 
breast cancer,' Amy wrote on her ABC blog.

Ms Robach wrote today that she 'got very lucky finding the cancer through our ABC sponsored mammogram and I got lucky choosing an aggressive approach.'

Sad news: Amy Robach, 40, announced on GMA that she has breast cancer and needed to undergo a double mastectomy

That same mommogram not only detected Ms Robach's breast cancer, but the second undetected tumor that 'no MRI, no mammogram, no sonogram had found…it was only through the mastectomy that [my doctor] discovered it,' she wrote.

She spoke on GMA last week about
 the experience and how it has affected her and her family.

'Robin Roberts and ABC saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram'

'Robin Roberts and ABC saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram,' she said.

'I'm 40 and I had been putting it off for a number of years - between flying all over the world for work and running around with my kids to school, ballet and gymnastics. Like so many women I just kept pushing it off.

Ms Roberts told Closer that Ms Robach 'came to me before going on the air to do the mammogram and I told her about how … it could help people. And little did we know, she was going to be the one who was going to be helped.'

Ms Roberts, who had her own struggles with breast cancer as well as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) last year, elborated, saying: 'I just can't believe it, a year ago she was there for me...I was home on bed rest and now I'm here for her.'

Fighting the fight: Robach (L) is undergoing experiences similar to those of her journalist colleague Robin Roberts (R)

Ms Robach is currently married her second husband - Melrose Place actor Andrew Shue - whom she wed in 2010 after meeting him at a book party.

She has two daughters with first husband Tim McIntosh, who she divorced in 2009. Before she moved to ABC, Amy was the Today show weekend host. She left NBC in May 2012.

Robin Roberts recently returned to 
Good Morning America after her own battle with breast cancer. She was 
first diagnosed in 2007 after discovering a lump during a 
self-examination.

She also 
made the brave decision to announce her illness on air. What followed 
was a partial mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation until she finally 
got the all clear.

Then in 
2012, she was diagnosed with MDS or myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a
 disease of the blood and bone marrow which was once known as 
pre-leukemia.

Be the 
Match Registry, a nonprofit organization run by the National Marrow 
Donor Program, experienced a 1,800 per cent spike in donors the day 
Roberts went public with her illness.

She took a leave from GMA to get a bone marrow transplant in October 
2012 but her recovery was documented on the morning show before she 
returned to GMA on February 20 of this year.
