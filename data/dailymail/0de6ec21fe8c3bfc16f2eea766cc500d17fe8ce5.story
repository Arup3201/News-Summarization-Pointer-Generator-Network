With the much-anticipated final on Sunday, World Cup excitement is reaching fever pitch.

Now new survey has looked at 30 countries to see which nationalities are winning in the bedroom – even if they’re losing on the pitch.

Leaving no question out of bounds, 35,000 21 -55 year-olds around the globe were quizzed on their sexual habits.

Overall, 79 percent of the world’s population say they are satisfied with their sex lives and the global average for foreplay and intercourse is 32.5 minutes.

The majority, some 55 per cent, has had one to eight sexual partners.

The English and Greek can console themselves for their lack of footballing success with the knowledge that they are happiest with their sex lives - almost a quarter claim to be completely satisfied in bed.

They’re followed closely by Japan in third, while Chile trails the pack, with just 13 per cent Only 13 being fully satisfied. 

The Brazilians have the most stamina, with more than 34 per cent claiming to last 46 minutes or more. 

In
 Japan, half the population has slept with three partners or fewer and more than 45 per cent of the population last no more than 20 
minutes.

Australia holds the record for quickest to score with 
10 per cent of the population calling match time within 10 minutes.

26 per cent of people in Switzerland claim to have slept with 20 people or more, followed closely by Greece with 25 per cent. In England, one in five have bedded more than 20 people.

And as well as keepy uppies and tackling, if there’s one thing some footballers are adept in, it’s playing away.

In the survey, France emerged as champion sex cheats, with 75 per cent of people admitting to have strayed
 away from their partners.

Latin American countries follow closely behind, with almost half the populations of Colombia, Brazil and Chile admitting to cheating too.

And if your partner is Belgian or Australian, you're in luck, as these nationalities appear to cheat the least.

When asked if they cheat because they’re unsatisfied – or are they just tired of faking it, half of all sexually active adults worldwide have faked it at least once.

Latin Americans are the biggest fakers with 70 per cent of Colombians admitting to faking it, followed closely by Chile and Brazil.
