A family is heartbroken after finding their thoroughbred horse Sugar dead with three bullet wounds.

Stanley Milligan said the 10-year-old mare was deliberately shot dead by a stranger at his Keefeton, Oklahoma, ranch on Sunday morning.

The grandfather said he is struggling to understand why anyone would kill an innocent animal.

Tragic: Stanley Milligan's 10-year-old thoroughbred horse Sugar was deliberately shot dead at his Keefeton, Oklahoma, ranch on Sunday (pictured)

Scene: Stanley Milligan speculated that the shooter fired at his horse Sugar (pictured) twice before she turned to run and was shot again at the Keefeton, Oklahoma, ranch

'It's like losing a family member really,' he told News9.com. 'What kind of people would do it you know? If they'd do that to an animal what would they do to a human?'

Milligan was hoping the mare would have colts which he could give to each of his grandchildren.

The horse owner said the shooting could not have been accidental because Sugar was shot three times.

'I think she had her head down and they pulled up on her, and she looked up,' Milligan said.

'Hit her right here and then right there, when she turned to run, she headed that way and they hit her in the rump.'

The Milligans have lived in Keefeton all their lives and say they've always got along with members of the tight-knit community.

While an investigation is underway, the Milligans are moving their other horses away from the property.
