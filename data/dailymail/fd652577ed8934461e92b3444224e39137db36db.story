A holiday rip-off that sees banks charge travellers £20million in fees to buy foreign currency with debit cards is to end.

Five of the country’s biggest banks will drop the charge following pressure from consumer groups and the Office of Fair Trading.

The fee is generally 1.5 to 2 per cent of the value of the amount of currency being bought.

Scrapped: Banks have agreed to stop charging holidaymakers for buying foreign currency with debit cards

It is one of a number of stealth 
charges used by banks to make an estimated £1.1billion a year from those
who use debit and credit cards for their foreign currency.

The decision to scrap it is predicted 
to save families and business travelers around £20million a year.

Official customer body Consumer Focus pointed out the actual cost to a 
bank of processing a debit card foreign currency purchase is around 9p, 
however customers were being charged up to £4.50.

Banks also generally take a percentage of the value of any foreign card transaction and then add a second service charge.

As a result, someone taking £200 out of a foreign cash machine can be charged almost £10.

Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Royal 
Bank of Scotland, Santander and the Co-operative Bank have all agreed to
remove the fees imposed on customers who buy foreign currency with a 
debit card. This brings them into line with Nationwide, HSBC and Halifax
Bank of Scotland, who do not charge a fee.

The decision by the five banks follows talks with OFT officials and a complaint from Consumer Focus.

They have agreed to give  ‘clearer, 
more accessible’ information about charges for using  cards abroad and 
many foreign exchanges have agreed to review marketing practices.

However there are suspicions banks will grab back the cash by pushing up other charges.

Consumer Focus chief Mike O’Connor 
said: ‘It is only right this unfair cost, which effectively charges 
customers for taking money out of their own account, is stopped.’

Marketing ploys: Banks will look into campaigns which are based around 0 per cent commission deals

Will buying travel money be cheaper?

Currently, buying £500 worth of euros over the counter with your debit card would mean an additional fee of between £10 and £30.

Five banks – Barclays, Co-operative Bank, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander – currently impose a charge of 1.5 and 2 per cent on customers using their debit cards to withdraw foreign currency before leaving the UK.

They have all agreed to scrap these charges by the end of 2012 under the new rules.

It will mean that travellers can use their debt cards to buy foreign currency from banks, bureau de change, the Post Office and travel agents without being charged to use their debit card. There will be still be a charge for credit cards.

The UK Cards Association and British Bankers Association has agreed that banks and lenders will give clearer, more accessible information about using cards abroad on websites, statements and through call centres.

What about when you’re abroad?

Currently banks and credit card companies hide the cost of using your card abroad within the items travellers have bought.

They will now have to show the charge, typically called a ‘loading fee’ usually of around 3 per cent, separately on bank statements.

Lloyds/HBOS, HSBC, Co-operative Bank, Capital One, RBS/Natwest and American Express have agreed to display the actual charges incurred by customers for using cards abroad far more clearly on their monthly and annual statements.

This will mean that customers can more easily work out how much they’re paying for foreign currency and give them the ability to shop around to get better deals.

What about pre-paid cards?

Pre-paid cards, which are loaded with currency before you go on holiday, often advertise 0 per cent commission offers but sting customers by pushing up exchange rates so they are not fee free – the OFT is forcing firms to review this strategy to reveal the exact costs.

Will the changes lead to less generous exchange rates?

As firms are forced to cut back on money making fees when proving currency there are some fears this may mean less generous exchange rates for customers.

A spokesman from Consumer Focus said that it would hope that competition between banks and other players such as the Post Office and bureaux de change would keep rates competitive.

However, it is up to individual firms to decide at what rate they set the exchange at.

If banks and others wish to offset the revenue lost from a ban on debit card fees with higher exchange rates, the rules mean customers will at least be able to identify and compare the advertised exchange rate of different providers.
