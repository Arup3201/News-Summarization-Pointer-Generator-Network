An Ohio family was reunited with its lost dog that went missing almost four-and-a-half years ago.

The Sinnett-Dekrell family lost German Shepherd Angel when she got out on Christmas Day in 2009, the Coshocton Tribune reports. No one responded to the family's extensive search campaign, which included fliers and social media.

Lost: Angel, seen here, got out on Christmas Day in 2009 and was separated from her family for nearly four-and-a-half years

'No one answered any of our fliers,' mother Maggie Sinnett told the paper. 'You go looking everywhere, but you don’t know where to look. You feel lost. You feel hopeless.'

Almost four-and-a-half years after Angel went missing, Sinnett was contacted by Richland County Dog Warden Dave Jordan on Monday, the paper says. Angel had been microchipped by the Sinnett-Dekrell family, but was wearing a collar from a different owner. She was picked up on Wednesday.

'He said "We found your dog,"' Sinnett told the Tribune. 'I was not expecting that.'

Sinnett 'was a little upset that someone kept her dog for so long,' the paper reports, 'but she was also appreciative that person was kind enough to keep her dog healthy.'

'She was like my child,' Sinnett told the Tribune. 'She was obviously very well loved and we are very thankful for that.'

Angel ran away multiple times before the 2009 incident, the paper reports, but had been recovered.

'[Angel] is back in our lives for a reason, and I do believe that,' Sinnett said. 'I don’t know what God’s plan is, but she’s here now and we’re all thankful.'
