With a manager as combustible and as clever as Jose Mourinho, you always know that he is going to blow at some stage of the season.

By highlighting Anthony Taylor’s performance at Southampton, where the referee gave Cesc Fabregas a yellow card for diving, Mourinho created some hysteria. 

That was a carefully orchestrated move by Mourinho, delivering the same message in each of his post-match press conferences with equal conviction.

Jose Mourinho's comments about referee Anthony Taylor were a calculated move designed to heap pressure on officials in the all-important Premier League title run-in, possibly to Chelsea's benefit

At face value it looked like he was trying to attack pundits, experts and analysts. By turning his fire on them, and away from the referee, he avoided an FA charge.

But his real target was referees. The title race could be decided by a referee’s decision and Mourinho wants to influence them.

At White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, Phil Dowd is on notice and will be well aware that Chelsea have not been awarded a penalty away from Stamford Bridge this season. That is an incredible statistic.

Dowd is one of the most volatile referees in the Barclays Premier League. Whenever he booked me he would flash the card so quickly that it felt he was about to punch me. Dowd treats players like little boys and can inflame and aggravate situations. He really used to wind me up.

This is a big test for him, a big night at White Hart Lane for Tottenham, and it comes just a few weeks after Mauricio Pochettino’s team lost 3-0 at Stamford Bridge.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Mourinho claimed that officials have a 'campaign' against Chelsea

Dowd’s last Chelsea match was their 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. He sent off Branislav Ivanovic in the 90th minute and Robin van Persie equalised 45 seconds later. If there are any tricky decisions to be made tonight, Dowd might have Jose’s comments ringing in his ears.

Mourinho is a brilliant team builder. He quickly identifies areas he needs to improve and creates a cause like no other manager in the Premier League. It can work as a real positive energy.

He is a trophy hunter and there is a lot of silverware to be won before he is done with English football. But his team, for all their quality, are stuttering on their travels after losing at Newcastle and drawing at Sunderland and Southampton.

It is easy to criticise a referee, to distract people from a performance, but I believe his recent comments were deliberate because he showed restraint. He did just enough to create headlines and debate — and to get inside the heads of referees.

Mourinho is a master manipulator, using situations to his advantage, and he knows the pressure is on Chelsea in the second half of the season. Manchester City are lurking in striking distance. 

At some stage his dressing room will feel tension because they are leading from the front and are expected to win their first Premier League title since he returned to Chelsea.

At Arsenal we had all sorts of little psychological ploys to gain an advantage before kick-off. Mourinho works the same way.

We would never come out of the dressing room at Highbury until the opposition were waiting for us in the tunnel. We are Arsenal, we decide when we come out.

In matches against Manchester United I would deliberately shield the officials as they came off the pitch at half-time so that Sir Alex Ferguson could not get to them. In games of this magnitude, you will seize upon any little advantage.

Mourinho must keep his players onside, convince them that they are the best team as they enter this crucial second half of the season.

Chelsea players do dive. They have had four yellow cards for simulation this season and there is a reason for that — our eyes are not deceiving us. Clearly, though, Mourinho wants to create an ‘us against the world’ mentality.

That attitude can really bond a group because if you feel you are hard done by, you are even more determined to play well. The other, more subtle impact is on referees. There is no doubt Mourinho makes comments like these to increase the pressure on officials.

Still, complaining in such exaggerated terms about Chelsea being victimised does not cast him in a good light. His team are top of the League and playing some of the best football ever seen at Stamford Bridge. He doesn’t need to complain, just win matches.

No-one wants to see a whingeing manager win trophies and as brilliant as Mourinho is — he’s one of the best — he might want to keep a lid on what he is saying.

When he came back to Stamford Bridge he talked about staying a long time. To do that he needs to make friends, not enemies. Just when we were starting to like him again he overstepped the mark at Southampton.

He has self-destructed at previous clubs and had to leave. He can’t afford to do the same again.

There isn’t a campaign or witch-hunt against Chelsea but Mourinho has stepped up the pressure on match officials at a crucial stage of the season. Tonight it will be fascinating to see how Dowd handles it.
