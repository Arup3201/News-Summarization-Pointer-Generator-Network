Conrad Hilton Jr was arrested in Los Angeles on Monday, nearly seven months after 'going insane' on an international flight back in July.

The 20-year-old little brother of Paris Hilton created a raucous scene aboard an airplane while flying from London to LA, according to a new report from TMZ.

The nephew of Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills stars Kyle and Kim Richards allegedly 'screamed and threatened flight attendants' yelling profane statements such as 'I will f**king own anyone on this flight; they are f**king peasants.'

Conrad - who is the grandson of famed hotel billionaire Conrad Hilton Sr - was 'ferociously punching the bulkhead of the plane, ten centimeters from a flight attendant's face' and 'went berserk causing children on the plane to cry.'

Witnesses revealed to the gossip site that he was yelling offensive blurbs such as 'If you wanna square up to me bro, then bring it and I will f**king fight you' and 'I will f**king rip through you and kill you.'

Also many on the same flight believed Conrad was smoking marijuana as they noticed a 'smell of weed seeping out of the bathroom.'

When Conrad fell asleep, 'the captain authorized crew members to restrain him to his seat for the descent and he was ultimately handcuffed to his seat.'

According to a report on TMZ, the young heir checked into rehab soon after landing.

This was not the first time, the young hotel heir had caused a disturbance on a plane.

Another source told the site: 'Conrad grabbed a flight attendant's shirt and said "I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss! My father will pay this out. He has done it before. Dad paid $300k last time.'

His father, Rick Hilton, has built a commercial real estate empire with his real estate brokerage company Hilton & Hyland and has an estimated net worth of $300m.

The Hilton family's attorney, Robert Shapiro confirmed to the gossip site that 'Conrad took a sleeping pill before the flight and wasn't himself.'

In documents obtained by TMZ, Conrad 'admitted to taking a sleeping pill before the flight and then bragged that he "buried" flight attendants' by telling the crew that he 'could get all of their jobs taken away in less than 30 seconds.'

In his client's defense, Shapiro said there are 'numerous news reports and cases of people experiencing adverse effects including aggressive outbursts.'
