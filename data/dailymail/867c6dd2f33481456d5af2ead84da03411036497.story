Philadelphia police this morning identified the two brothers who have been charged with the murder of a police officer who was gunned down while trying to stop a video game store robbery.

During a press conference held at 11.15am Friday, Philadelphia Police Capt. Darrell Clark named the suspects in the fatal shooting of Officer Robert Wilson III as Ramone Williams, 26, and Carlton Hipps, 30, 

Williams had two prior arrests, while Hipps had six arrests and had been out on parole since 2009 following a robbery conviction. 

The pair of suspects have been charged with murder and attempted murder.

Officer: Philadelphia Police Officer Robert Wilson III, 30 (photographed), died Thursday after being shot in the head during an attempted robbery at a video-game store on the city's north side

Wilson, 30, was in a north Philadelphia GameStop in full uniform buying a video game for his 8-year-old son for getting good grades when the two suspects entered and announced a robbery.

Wilson immediately confronted the suspects, and the three exchanged gunfire, with the assailants firing rounds at close range on either side of the officer, Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters.

Wilson was struck multiple times in his body but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head, Ramsey said.

'The officer was an out-and-out hero and a warrior,' Captain Clark told reporters Friday. 'He fought to the end.'  

Wilson's partner, Officer Stevenson, was outside of the store and exchanged fire with one of the assailants. The second assailant fled and attempted to blend in with the crowd but was caught at the scene.

One was shot in the leg, Ramsey said, but it is unclear if the assailant was shot by Wilson or his partner. 

According to police, Williams confessed to the fatal robbery, telling investigators during questioning that he and his brother had thought the GameStop was going to be an easy target. 

Wilson was rushed to Temple University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6.25pm, NBC reports.

Wilson was an eight-year veteran of the department, a husband, and a father of two boys, ages 1 and eight. His older son will celebrate his 9th birthday Monday.

Struck: Wilson was struck multiple times but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head (here, Wilson's body is transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office)

Procession: A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office

Never Forgotten: Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten'

'Take a moment and say a prayer for this family,' Ramsey said. 'And this 9-year-old boy who will now grow up without a father. A 1-year-old is going to grow up without a dad because of what happened today.'

Authorities later found the suspect's weapons in the store: a .40-caliber and a 9mm. Another weapon, an AK-47, was recovered during a search warrant at one of the suspects' home, Ramsey said.

In all, over 50 shots were fired during the gun battle inside the video game store.  

Police say both the suspects were repeat offenders and one was on parole at the time of the shooting. 

The suspect who was shot was taken to a local hospital but his condition has not been released, NBC reports.

Wilson was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting, Ramsey said. However, a surveillance camera in the store captured the incident. 

The video has been reviewed by homicide investigators.

A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office.

At the news conference, Ramsey said he met Wilson and his partner when they took part in a recent pilot program in which officers wore body cameras. He described the father of two as a 'very, very brave, heroic individual.'  

'People tend to lose sight of the dangers inherent in being a police officer,' Ramsey said. 

'Sometimes they're seriously injured or even murdered as a result of trying to protect every single person in this city...He put his life on the line to make Philadelphia a better city and a safer city.'

Condolences: Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement offering his condolences to Wilson's family and his colleagues

Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten.' 

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement offering his condolences to Wilson's family and his colleagues. 

'This senseless act is devastating and a stark reminder of the danger faced everyday by our brave men and women in uniform,' Wolf said.

'Across Pennsylvania, members of law enforcement and our first responders put their lives on the line to protect our families and our communities. We can never forget their selfless service and sacrifice.'

Wilson is the fifth Philadelphia Police officer to die due to a gun shot wound since 2007, according to the Fraternal Order of Police.
