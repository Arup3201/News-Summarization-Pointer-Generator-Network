A man who dived into a river to help a desperate mother save a helpless child from drowning after her pram rolled off a quayside has relived the heroic moment today.

Victor Martinez, 51, said he didn't think twice about plunging in to Exeter Quay in Devon after the pram rolled into the water with the young girl strapped inside.

The rower jumped
 into the water with teammates Stuart Menzies and Andy Travers - who 
were in the city to take part in the British Dragon Boat race.

Speaking today he said: 'I was standing on the side with other members of my team - The Raging Dragons - when I heard a deafening scream.

Quick-thinking passers-by also flung themselves into the water and the toddler, who is believed to be about a year old, was brought back to the safety of the quayside

Victor Martinez, 51, said he didn't think twice about jumping in to help with the dramatic rescue

‘At first I wondered why the woman was
 so worried about a pram, but then I saw the baby girl’s arms flailing 
on both sides of the buggy.

‘I
 didn’t think about it, I just ran and dived straight in the water. I 
think I hit the water at the same time as the buggy. I didn’t think 
twice.’

Quick-thinking passers-by also flung 
themselves into the water and the toddler.

Recalling the events, Mr Martinez said: 'The buggy was sinking quickly and I dived down to get under it to try push it to the surface'

Mr Martinez added: ‘The buggy was sinking quickly and I dived down to get under it to try push it to the surface.

‘It
 was getting heavier and heavier, and me and my teammate Stuart Menzies,
 who jumped in after me, were struggling to push it up.’

‘I thought about unstrapping the baby but I just kept thinking we have to get her to the surface quickly.

‘We managed to get her to the top and I was struggling to keep the buggy at the surface when I saw the girl’s face for the first time - she was screaming and crying but I looked into her eyes which were full of river water and just thought that she wasn’t going to drown today.

‘I think seeing her face gave me the extra push and we managed to get the pram to the wall.’

The hero eventually managed to get the child back up to the surface - before pulling her towards dry land.

Once on the side of the quay, Mr Martinez’s son Victor reached down and helped to pull the buggy and child to the top of the wall.

Mr Martinez then swam back over to the mother before helping her out of the water.

‘I could still hear the mother screaming, she was in deep shock so I just went over to her and grabbed her face,’ he said.

‘She was shaking so much, I looked her in the eyes and told her that her baby needs her now.’

Bystanders and the first aid team for the dragon boat race helped look after the child and checked her over for injuries.

Jenny Wisson was one of the first on the scene and helped dress the girl in her son’s spare clothes after she was pulled out in the dramatic rescue.

Witnesses said the mother and child were sat watching the event when the buggy rolled into the water

She said: ‘I heard a bloodcurdling scream at which point I looked over and saw a few people jumping in.

'It wasn’t until I got nearer I realised it was a baby in a pushchair.’

Eyewitness Debbie Manning, of the Cambridgeshire Royals Dragon Boat club, added: ‘It was incredible to see.

‘It was all quite a drama but thankfully everybody seemed to be OK.’

The British Dragon Boat Racing Association, which put on the event, praised the actions of the rescuers.

A spokesman said: 'There was some 
serious additional drama when a pram complete with small child strapped 
in ended up falling into the river at The Quay.

- Rescuer Victor Martinez

‘Thanks to some quick-thinking by Stuart Menzies, Vic Martinez and Andy Travers of Raging Dragons who jumped in to rescue the child and pram, it had a happy ending with the child seemingly ending up without a scratch, though a little wet.

‘There were even a couple of midwives in the Worcester crew who were able to help check everything was okay with the child.

‘After some time to recover from the shock of the ordeal, the mother and baby were last seen heading home away from the water.

‘Thank you to all those involved in the rescue and preventing a much more serious and easily life-threatening situation.’

The youngster later appeared to be seemingly well and was seen laughing but was taken to hospital by her mother for a check-up as a precaution.
