Many people covet a celebrity body but one woman was shocked rather than flattered when she was likened to Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus.

Being told she was the spitting image of the singer gave Katie Lawton, 22, from Stoke-on-Trent, the motivation she needed to lose weight.

Her step-sister, Stacey Wisdom, also from Stoke-on-Trent, agreed to join her on her weightloss programme and between them they shed 12 stone.

Slimming sisters: Katie Lawton (L) and Stacey Wisdom lost twelve stone between them after Katie was compared to Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus

Katie, who tipped the scales at just over 19 stone and struggled to squeeze into a size 20 dress, and size 16 Stacey, who weighed almost 13 stone, decided to diet after Katie was compared to the overweight singer.

Katie said: 'I was walking along Blackpool Pier when one of the stall holders tried to get me to play a game. One of the prizes was a Michelle McManus CD, and he said that I looked like her.

'It was just very embarrassing. I couldn't believe he would say something like that.'

When Katie returned home and recalled the incident to her step-sister, the pair realised it was time to make a change.

Stacey, 31, said: 'After Katie told me what happened, we went online to look at pictures of Michelle.

'It was a shock to both of us and I think it did trigger something - we signed up to Weight Watchers.

'I’m
sure that small minded man in Blackpool has never thought about what he
said since, but now we can look back at him and be proud of how far 
we’ve come. People need to be aware that small minded comments like that can really hurt.'

Since
joining Weight Watchers in September 2011, the sisters have supported 
each other in losing weight, which they credit as the key to their 
success.

Final straw: It was only after Katie, 22, was mocked by fairground staff at Blackpool Pier who compared her to Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus (R), that the sisters decided to lose weight

As they were: Katie (L) tipped the scales at just over 19 stone, and struggled to squeeze into a size 20 dress, and size 16 Stacey weighed almost 13 stone

Healthy and happy: Stacey now weighs in at a 8st 9lbs, and sister Katie (L) is a healthy 11st 7lbs

Stacey now weighs in at a 8st 9lbs, and Katie is 11st 7lbs.

Katie said: 'My sister has been so supportive. We wouldn't have last as long as we have without each other - especially at the beginning, Stacey really kept me going.

'She'd remind me how much weight I'd already lost and how far I'd come.

'As she had less weight to lose she reached her goal first, so it was an inspiration for me. I knew that if she could do it, then so could I.'

Stacey agrees, adding: 'I lost the weight quicker, but I needed Katie to help me maintain it.

'Because she was still going to the meetings it meant I did too. I'd have probably put it all back on if it wasn't for her.'

Body confident: Katie says she used to struggle to buy nice outfits but since she has lost weight, she is much more confident

Yo-yo: Stacey admits she used to be a yo-yo dieter but has since kick-started a healthy programme and maintained her svelte figure

Before joining Weight Watchers two years ago, both sisters hated their figures.

Stacey said: 'I was a bit of a yo-yo dieter. I'd lose a bit of weight but then just put more on.

'It really made my feel bad about myself. Things like going shopping for new clothes was just awful.

'You’d have to root to the back of the rail to find your size and when you put it on it never looked as good as you wanted.'

Katie
said: 'I remember it was my son's christening so I was looking for 
outfits, and I just couldn't find anything nice to wear. It was just horrendous - but now you can't get me out of the shops.'

Now the sisters say they've never been happier.

Katie said: 'I feel like a different person since I've lost my weight - it's amazing. It's improved my confidence so much and I feel so much happier.

Support: Stacey admitted that she lost the weight quicker than her sister, but needed Katie to help her maintain it

Sisterly support: The slimming duo said they wouldn't have coped if they didn't have each other to spur them on

'I’m starting a new course at college and before I’d have been so nervous, but now I’m fine about meeting new people.

'I do so much more with my little boy too - everything is so much better. I will never go back to where I was before, I’m so proud of what I’ve done.'

Stacey said: 'I think differently about food now. I used to always say that I would never be slim but now I’ve actually achieved it.

'If you put 100 per cent in, you'll get 100 per cent out - that’s how Katie and I are where we are today.'
