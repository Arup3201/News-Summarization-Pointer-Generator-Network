Anti-discrimination campaigners Kick It Out have criticised Wigan for appointing Malky Mackay as manager before the Football Association have finished their investigation into his conduct and have called on the governing body to reveal their findings.

Sportsmail broke the news that the FA had been handed a dossier of evidence accusing Mackay and Iain Moody of sending a shocking series of racist, anti-semitic, sexist and homophobic text messages in August.

But Mackay, the former Cardiff manager, has been handed a route back into football just three months later after he was appointed as Wigan manager – while the FA's investigation is still on-going.

Malky Mackay will be a controversial appointment at Wigan, definitely, but he does have a proven track record as a manager at Championship level. 

He took Watford into the Premier League through the play-offs and was promoted with Cardiff too, as well as taking them to the League Cup final when they were unlucky to lose to Liverpool. 

Mackay is a big manager for Wigan and I’m sure he won’t give us a bad name. We are a small team and we’ve always punched above our weight.

I think he deserved a second chance and it’s a good appointment. I don’t think there will be any protests by our fans on Saturday. There may be some chants from the away end but no complaints from us.

A Kick It Out spokesman said: 'The Football Association began investigating in August alleged racist, anti-semitic, sexist and homophobic comments made by Malky Mackay and Iain Moody, and we are still yet to hear whether this is near to reaching its conclusion almost three months on. 

'Where does the case now lie and how close are we to seeing whether The FA will take the appropriate action?

'Wigan Athletic have disregarded the on-going investigation being undertaken by The FA, and any potential punishment Mackay may face, by taking the decision to appoint him. 

'We need to see leadership, and a respect for the processes in place, shown by football club owners to demonstrate how seriously they take tackling issues of exclusion, prejudice and discrimination.'

The scandal cost Moody his job as Crystal Palace's director of football and caused Mackay to pull out of the running for the Palace managers job.

But Kick It Out have been left bemused by Wigan owner Dave Whelan's decision to put Mackay in charge of the club.

'It remains to be seen if Wigan’s position is one which the FA and all of football’s so-called ‘family’ are happy with,' the spokesman added. 

'The FA now needs to move swiftly to let everybody know whether they agree with Wigan’s position or whether they will reinforce their own zero-tolerance stance on all such matters of equality and diversity. We await The FA’s response before commenting further.'
