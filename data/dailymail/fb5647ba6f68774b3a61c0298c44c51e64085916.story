Royal memorabilia is sought after by collectors around the world, particularly those pieces associated with weddings.

The general public aren't immune to the lure of marriage keepsakes either: it is rare to find a house in the UK without a commemorative mug or tea towel from either Charles and Diana's wedding or the more recent marriage of the Duchess of Cambridge to Prince William.

And now, an exiting new auction will offer collectors a unique opportunity to own a very special souvenir: a piece of the wedding cake from Kate and William's big day.

Legacy: At the Julien's auction in Beverly Hills, a slice of cake from the 2011 royal wedding of  Prince William, and Kate Middleton is on sale

The cake is to be auctioned at Julien's auction house in Beverley Hills, California, as part of a special sale that will see a collection of the late Lady Diana Spencer's dresses go on sale alongside the wedding cake.

Diana's dresses are expected to reach prices up to $130,000 (£80,000), while the single slice from the 2011 nuptials is estimated to fetch between $1000 (£600) and $2000 (£1,200).

The cake was a bespoke creation, crafted by cake-maker Fiona Cairns. It took her five weeks to complete the confectionery masterpiece.

The elaborate gateau was covered in cream and white icing and decorated with 900 delicate sugar-paste flowers. The culinary masterpiece took centre-stage at the Buckingham Palace reception held in the picture gallery on the day of their wedding.

Fiona, 59, whose confections are sold in Harrods, Selfridges and Waitrose, was contacted by St James's Palace in February and asked if she would make William and Kate's wedding cake.

It appears that the humble slice of wedding cake may be worth its grand price tag as Fiona says that creating the dessert was a meticulous and exhausting task.  

'We reflected some of the architectural details in the room so the garlands on the walls were reproduced loosely on the fourth tier - we've used roses, acorns, ivy leaves, apple blossom and bridal rose.'

The bride wanted elements from the Joseph Lambeth technique of cake decoration, where intricate piping is used to make three dimensional scroll work, leaves, and flowers.

Royal wedding memorabilia is extremely collectible and hard to get hold of, the Julien's auction will offer a rare opportunity to fans, pictured - Kate and Will on their wedding day in 2011

Kate also gave Fiona detailed instructions for her to include 17 different blooms and foliage for their meaning or symbolism - known as the 'language of flowers'. 

With this in mind it seems that such an iconic component of the wedding should be deserving of such a royal price tag.

Also under the hammer is a blank invitation to the same wedding, printed on Queen Elizabeth II's Buckingham Palace stationary.

'The Lord Chamberlain is commanded by The Queen to invite __ to the Marriage of His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales, K.G. with Miss Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on Friday 29th April at 11.00 a.m.,' it reads. 'Dress: Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit.'

It is sure to be met with an equally eager set of bidders. 

The Exquisite Collection of HRH Diana, Princess of Wales auction will take place on 5th December 2014 at Julien's auction house Beverley Hills California

A collection of the late Diana, Princess of Wales's dresses which she auctioned off for charity in London in 1997 herself, will  go under the hammer again this December in Beverly Hills, California.

The outfits, all but one designed by the late Catherine Walker, Diana's personal couturier and close friend for 16 years, are estimated to fetch between $60,000 and $100,000.

At the highest end of the price spectrum is a cream lace dress designed by Zandra Rhodes and worn by Diana in 1987 to the Birthright Benefit at the London Palladium; while bidders on a lower budget might snap themselves up a pair of cuff-links commemorating Diana and Prince Charles' 1981 wedding, valued at $600 to $800.

The June 1997 auction, Dresses from the Collection of Diana, Princess of Wales, was handled by Christie's of London, only one month before Diana was killed in a car accident in Paris at the age of 36. 

The anonymous winners will now part with their collectors items at the upcoming Beverly Hills show, handled by Julien's Auctions,

Along with the items, which will go up for auction December 5,  is a copy of an oversized catalogue which accompanied the original auction, as well as an invitation to the event; signed by Diana, and valued at between $2,000 and $4,000.

Other garments that will feature will include a Catherine Walker petal pink dress, embellished with beads and mock pearls, worn by Diana in 1993 to the Savoy Theatre in London and estimated to fetch between $60,000 and $80,000.

A vivid green silk gown Diana wore the same year, also in London, to a banquet at the Dorchester Hotel, is also expected to go for between $60,000 and $80,000.

Additionally, a strapless monochrome number which she wore to a private event, is estimated at the same value.

Ms Walker, who died in 2012 after a long battle with cancer, worked tirelessly to create over 1,000 outfits for Diana; from right after her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles, to until her death in 1997.

According to a friend of Miss Walker, journalist Alison Jane Reid - who wrote an in-depth story about her for MailOnline in 2010 - the Princess and the designer were close, and their relationship founded on 'loyalty and total discretion.'

Reid wrote: 'After Diana’s separation from Prince Charles in 1992, clothes became even more important to her.

'Together, the two women devised a joint strategy of ‘defiant’ frocks - body-conscious but without vulgarity - that Diana wore in separation and divorce.'
