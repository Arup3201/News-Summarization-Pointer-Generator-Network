Large, attractive period property, centrally located with sweeping views of Washington DC. Any takers?

A firm of estate agents has estimated that if it was put up for sale on the open market, the White House - the iconic official residence of the US president - would be worth around $300 Million.

Since President Barack Obama first moved in at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in January 2009, its value has risen approximately 7 percent, according to the company, Zillow.

Many people have dreamed of getting the keys to the White House as president - but affording to buy the place is a different matter altogether... if it was for sale that is.

The firm calculated the White House's current value at $294.9 million, on the basis of it being available as a home to purchase based in part on public data and recent sales.

In Washington, DC, as a whole, Zillow's Home Value Index (ZHVI) rose almost 13.6 percent — to $397,000, from $349,600 — between January 2009 and November 2012, according to NBC.com.

Meanwhile home values fell nationally by roughly 5.3 percent over the same period, to $156,200 in November 2012, the site reports.

The monthly payment - on a fixed rate 30-year mortgage - for the White House would be $1,130,832, assuming a 20 per cent deposit and 3.276 per cent interest rate, according to Zillow.

Even though $300 million might seem a little steep - buyers would get an incredible package for their money.

Designed in the neo-classical style by architect James Hoban, the White House is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park.

It is made up of six stories including a two-story basement and has around 55,000 square feet of indoor space - including 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms and 16 bedrooms.
