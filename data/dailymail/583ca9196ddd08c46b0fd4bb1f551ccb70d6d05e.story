Tony Blair is preparing a new push to re-enter British politics as he hires a new spin doctor to put a gloss on some of the criticism that has followed him since leaving Number 10.

The former prime minister ‘has things to say’ and believes the time is right for him to make an impact on the home front after years in political exile.

Mr Blair's is expected to launch his comeback as he appears on a joint platform with Labour leader Ed Miliband in July at an event to celebrate the Olympics.

His wife Cherie is also due to attend, making it a rare public outing for the Blairs together.

'I have things to say': Tony Blair wants to re-engage with British politics after amassing an estimated £20million fortune since leaving office five years ago

Could the return of Tony Blair be good for British politics?

Now share your opinion

The ex-PM is understood to believe that 
enough time has passed for people to have forgotten the disastrous 
effect of the Iraq war on his image and how he was humiliatingly forced 
from office by Gordon Brown.

The move to hire a public relations expert is proof that Mr Blair wants to be heard on a range of subjects.

The spin doctor will also attempt to portray Mr Blair's cash schemes - such as charging up to £300,000 for after-dinner speeches - in a more positive light.

In the latest accusation of greed, it was revealed in January that Mr Blair
 made millions of pounds last year but paid just a fraction of it in tax
 thanks to a complicated web of companies he has established.

The former prime minister’s secretive
 business empire declared an income of £12million.

But he was able to 
reduce his tax bill to just £315,000 after writing off almost £11million
 as ‘administrative expenses’ – a ‘surprisingly’ high figure, according 
to one accountant.

Being driven out of office by a plotting former ally may not have seemed like the most edifying climax to his premiership.

But for Tony Blair his fortunes have gone from strength to strength since since leaving Downing Street in June 2007.

It's perhaps no surprise then that he quit his job as an MP for Sedgefield - a post he had for two-and-a-half decades - with its £65,000 salary.

Instead, he seems to have left his socialist ideals in County Durham and quickly embarked on the lucrative after-dinner circuit where he can pocket up to £250,000 a night for a 90-minute delivery.

The ex-PM signed a £5million deal with Random House in the same year as leaving office to write his Number 10 memoirs. The royalties from those are said to have earned him millions more.

He was later appointed Middle East peace envoy.

But if he that wasn't keeping him busy enough, Mr Blair set up the the Tony Blair Faith Foundation in May 2008 to spread his message around the world. This spawned the Tony Blair Sports Foundation and the charities are now moving into bigger buildings.

He is also a senior advisor at investment bank JP Morgan (salary estimates range between £500,000 and £2.5m) and advises the Swiss insurance firm Zurich Financial Services on climate change issues for a reputed £1m a year, not to mention his consulting role with luxury goods firm LVMH. And he was said to have been paid an estimated £1m for writing a report for the government of Kuwait on the future of the oil-rich state.

Indeed, such is the demand for Mr Blair's advisory services that he set up a commercial consultancy firm, Tony Blair Associates, which by then end of 2010 had banked at least £2m advising foreign countries and businesses.

Finally, Blair, who is married to Cherie Booth QC, the barrister daughter of actor Tony Booth, also boasts an enviable property portfolio. At one point he had seven homes around the country worth at least £15m.

On top of this, Blair receives £84,000 of taxpayers' money to run a private office, and he is also entitled to draw a pension of £63,468.

The figures show that Mr Blair employed 26 staff, paying them total wages of almost £2.3million, while another £850,000 went on office rent and equipment.

Yet that leaves almost £8million of unexplained ‘expenses’ in the accounts, lodged at Companies House.

Mr Blair has now recruited Rachel Grant, an ex-Downing Street and Whitehall press 
officer who is now communications director at charity the National 
Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (Nesta).

The former PM is still employed as a Middle East peace envoy, as well as running a faith foundation and earning millions of pounds in consultancy fees through a complicated web of companies.

But for several months he has been privately meeting small groups of Labour MPs to discuss domestic politics.

Mr Blair has targeted old allies and members of the 2010 intake, advising on how to target the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, who he believes made a historic error by joining the Coalition.

Mr Miliband’s aides say the pair now talk ‘regularly’ – code for chats every few weeks – about domestic politics and foreign affairs.

Mr Blair’s aides think the time is right for him to speak out in the UK. They believe enough time has passed since he was driven from office in 2007 on a wave of disgust at the Iraq War.

A source close to Mr Blair said: ‘He wants to re-engage in the UK. He has things to say and he thinks it’s the right time.

‘The question is how he re-enters the UK scene without re-entering domestic politics and interfering with the Labour Party.

'He wants to intervene where he can add value to political debate, but it will be above party politics.’

Mr Miliband opposed the war in Iraq but respects Mr Blair as one of the most accomplished political message-makers of his time.

Rachel Grant will take up her role later this month, overseeing the former prime minister’s personal public relations and taking charge of the communications strategy for his extensive business operations.

Her appointment has been seen in the PR industry as an attempt to rebuild Mr Blair’s reputation at home, following adverse publicity over his money-spinning ventures.

He has attracted criticism for 
combining his business interests with charitable work and his Middle 
East role and is thought to have amassed a fortune in excess of 
£20million in the five years since he left Downing Street and stepped 
down as MP for Sedgefield, County Durham, which he had served since 
1983.

Mr Blair has also amassed a property portfolio, including homes in London and  country retreats, that at one point was worth £15m.

He has also been criticised for earning cast sums for his after-dinner speeches. He charges up to £250,000 a time for just 90 minutes.

Miss Grant 
previously worked in No 10 as a senior press officer, going on to be 
head of news at the Department for Work and Pensions and then the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit attacked the former PM, branding his political legacy ‘debt, war, ignorance, welfare dependency, social division’.

He said: ‘Blairite education policies have brought about an upsurge in illiteracy and innumeracy, and left a generation of near-unemployable young people.’

Blair's apparent political comeback will mean less attention for his charitable ventures. Upon leaving office he set up the Tony Blair Faith Foundation then the Sports Foundation.

The charities have been so successful that last month it was reported that they were moving out into bigger offices.

There is 
no doubt that the Tony Blair was one of the smartest political operators
 in Westminster since World War Two, but he was not a flawless 
character.

Blair will be remembered for the Iraq War, and all the accusations of lies and evasions that that spawned.

Many in 
the Labour Party would simply like to forget him, even though he brought
 them an unprecedented three general election wins.

And I 
expect the last thing that Ed Miliband wants is to be overshadowed by 
Blair, however ‘helpful’ the former Prime Minister claims to be.
