Fined: Ira Rennert (pictured in December) was hit with a $118million penalty over money he took from his mining company

The billionaire owner of one of the largest and most lavish homes in the U.S. was fined $118million on Friday for pillaging his mining firm to pay for the mansion.

Ira Rennert, 80, who owned a magnesium company which went bankrupt in 2001, paid himself huge dividends even though he knew expensive court battles would soon hit the company.

A jury in Manhattan agreed that he and his company, Renco Group Inc., siphoned off the cash in breach of his trust to shareholders in the company, named MagCorp.

They pointed to his enormous home in the Hamptons, a 29-room mansion called Fairfield, as proof of how he profited from removing the money from his firm, called MagCorp.

His lawyers had tried to argue that it was the recession following the dotcom bubble which actually finished the company - but the jury decided in favor of MagCorp's creditors.

The luxury home sits not far from the beach in exclusive Sagaponack. To go with its 29 bed chambers, it has 39 bathrooms, a 164-seat theater, basketball court, gymnasium two-lane bowling alley, and a 100-car garage. It is valued around $500million.

The house that MagCorp built? A jury decided that Rennert breached his obligations to shareholders when taking $120million out of the company - which they say he used to build his luxury Hamptons home, above

While the fine demanded was $118million, to match a $120million payout around 2001, after interest is applied, Rennert could be stung for as much as $400million, according to Bloomberg.

Rennert was born in Brooklyn in 1934, and went on to graduate from Brooklyn College before landing a job on Wall Street and finding financial success.

In addition to his home on Long Island, he also owns an apartment at 625 Park Avenue in Manhattan and is worth an estimated $6.1billion according to Forbes.Â
