Taihe, in the eastern province of Anhui, is home to more than 400 companies processing human hair into a variety of styles, including curly extensions, wigs and Afros which end up on heads in the United States, Europe and Africa.

It is one of many 'industrial clusters' - areas that specialise on a single product - that have emerged in recent decades as a result of the booming Chinese economy.

Fu Quanguo, 64, pioneered the trade in the 1970s. 

He said: 'We used to collect the human hair locally, but now it comes from all kinds of countries, like Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Vietnam. 

'In the past making hair products was tough, and we did it all by hand. Now we've gone from small to big and are selling internationally.'

Mr Quanguo's son, Fu Qianwei, 36, has a company with the English name Anna and export sales of £4.7 million a year, mostly to the United States. He employs more than 200 full-time staff. 

He said: 'Each country has different demands on length, thickness and quality.

'As Africa's economy grows, the market is growing and moving towards higher quality.
