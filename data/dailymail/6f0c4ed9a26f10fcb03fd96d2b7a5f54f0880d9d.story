Dani Alves has joined the long list of footballers with questionable dress senses after buying a pair of glittery gold teddy-bear shaped trainers. 

The bizarre shoes have caused a stir on social media after his Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi posted a picture of them on his official Instagram account on Monday.   

Of course, Messi is no stranger to fashion faux pas himself and has developed a reputation for his own outlandish clothes over the years.

Messi's Ballon d'Or suits have drawn him particular scrutiny.  

In recent years, he has shocked audiences with a mauve velvet waistcoat ensemble, polka-dotted tuxedo as well as shiny red and maroon lounge suits.   

When all is said and done though, Messi remains La Liga's all time leading goal-scorer and arguably the most gifted player of his generation.
