Tragedy: Detectives are treating the death of pharmacist Joanna Smith, 32, as manslaughter after her tryes were found to have been deliberately punctured

A crash which claimed the life of a 32-year-old woman was caused by vandalism to one of the tyres on her car, police have said.

Detectives are now treating the death of pharmacist Joanna Smith as manslaughter after forensic tests showed a tyre on her Honda Jazz had been punctured deliberately.

It is the first time in the UK a fatal car crash has been blamed on vandals.

Mrs Smith, from Northampton, who had 
been married to husband John Smith for under a year, is thought to have 
been unaware of the vandalism when she set off for work in Irchester on 
the morning of April 10.

The victim, originally from Poznan in 
Poland, was pronounced dead on the eastbound A45 near Earls Barton after
the damaged tyre caused her to crash while travelling at between 60mph 
and 70mph.

Detective Chief Inspector Martin 
Kinchin, from the East Midlands special operations unit major crime 
team, said: 'While investigating the incident that led to Joanna’s 
death, our collision investigation team established that it was likely 
that tyre failure caused a loss of control of the car.

'The tyres from Joanna’s car were 
then sent to scientists who are specialists in the examination of tyres,
who concluded that one of them had been deliberately punctured.'

Following the collision, officers were informed by members of the public that a further three vehicles parked in close proximity to the Honda had also sustained tyre damage at the same time.

The victim’s vehicle was parked in a communal car park near her home in Grange Park when the tyre - which only partially deflated - was punctured.

Mr Kinchin added: 'After being informed by the scientists that Joanna’s tyre had been deliberately damaged, coupled with the other three incidents in the area where Joanna lived, we contacted the Crown Prosecution Service for advice about how the case should proceed.

Plea: The police are appealing for information into Joanna's death

'Following their feedback we are now investigating the collision as manslaughter.

'We believe that someone deliberately damaged the tyre on Joanna’s car which ultimately resulted in her death.

'We do not believe Joanna was specifically targeted but was the tragic victim of senseless vandalism.'

Mr Kinchin continued: 'Although we do not believe the person who damaged Joanna’s car set out to cause her death, their actions had a very serious outcome.

'Anyone committing this kind of crime needs to stop and think about the potential consequences of their actions.

'We believe someone knows who the offender is and would ask them to think about the impact Joanna’s death has had on her family and friends, and ask them to give us any information they may have.'
