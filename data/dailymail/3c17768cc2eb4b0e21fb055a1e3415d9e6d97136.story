For many people, a pet can be their most loyal companion - a trusted soul-mate with whom they experience the highs and lows of life. 

Now, photographer Elena Shumilova has captured the inseparable bond that exists between pets and their owners in a heart-warming selection of pictures.

They capture children and their pets at various moments in every-day life in Moscow and Andreapol, Russia.

Children are pictured playfully chasing their pets in a woodland, gazing out of a frosty, steamed up window before bed and finally snuggling up with their pets as they doze off.

The pictures are taken by Elena Shumilova, a mother-of-two. She said: 'I felt so inspired when I was creating these images. Pets are members of our family and there's nothing more natural and more important than the desire to care for someone you love.

'The children in the photos are from Moscow and Andreapol, and they are photographed with their own pets.'

She added: 'Children and animals - that's my life.

'I am mum to two boys and we spend a lot of time on the farm. I shoot my boys, my dog, rabbits, ducks and sometimes my friends and their children.

'And I always photograph my kids and friends when we go for a walk.'

Rural settings, natural phenomena and the changing seasons seem to be the greatest stimuli in her works. 

'When shooting I prefer to use natural light – both inside and outside. I love all sorts of light conditions – street lights, candle light, fog, smoke, rain and snow – everything that gives visual and emotional depth to the image,' the photographer said. 

The work was commissioned by Petcurean Pet Nutrition.

Jaimie Turkington, from Petcurean, said: 'The images Elena has contributed to our Nourish for Life campaign fully express the depth of the human and pet bond in a way that words alone never could.

'She captures something pure, yet powerful about our relationships with our pets that will connect with all kinds of pet parents, anywhere in the world.'
