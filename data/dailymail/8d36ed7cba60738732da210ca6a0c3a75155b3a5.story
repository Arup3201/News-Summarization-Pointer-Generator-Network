Murder suspect Nikolai Rakossi, nicknamed 'Russian Rambo,' seen here for the first time inside his pre-trial jail, is finally expected to face justice this winter after being accused of the brutal knifings of his American girlfriend and her daughter.

The 61-year old-former Soviet paratrooper was held by Russian police last year on evidence from the US authorities linking him to the gruesome New York murders three years ago.

Tatyana Prikhodko, 56, and her beautiful daughter Larisa, 28, both nurses, were found butchered in the family home in Brooklyn.

Stunning: It is believed that Larisa Prikhodko, pictured, walked in on her mother and Rakossi arguing

A mother with a young son, Larisa was stabbed numerous times in the torso. Her body was discovered in a bedroom.

Tatyana's throat was slashed open and she had multiple stab wounds to her chest and face.

In the hours after the double homicide on 16 April 2011, Rakossi fled back to Moscow, using a one-way Aeroflot ticket he allegedly bought ahead of the killings.

Rakossi, a veteran of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, was on the run in Russia for more than two years before being detained after he was snared a year ago (October 2013) in a flat in his home city of Novomoskovsk. 

After reaching Moscow, Rakossi vanished, with sources saying relatives helped hide him for more than two years

Tatyana's other daughter, Svetlana Prikhodko, 34, said she is frustrated by the delay in bringing Rakossi to court over the killing of her mother and sister, but is hopeful the trial will go ahead early next year.

'He is still in detention centre while Russian investigators prepare documents for the court,' she told Mail Online.

'It took a very long time to receive documents from America, and now naturally it takes a lot of time to translate them.

'We were told we would be informed as soon as the documents are ready, so that we can see them before the court.

'I expect the court to be in winter, at the beginning of next year, though we were not told the time yet.'

She expressed the fear that Rakossi could protest his innocence in front of jurors at a time when there is a wave of anti-Americanism in Russia over the crisis in Ukraine.

'It is going to be a jury, so there is no guarantee on the verdict here, specially if he will be doing his tearful performances and passionate promises that it wasn't him,' she said.

'But I do hope that there will be enough evidence to proof that it was him. I wish this case was closed once and forever, as it is a non-stop nightmare.'

A source in the Russian Investigative Committee, the equivalent of the FBI which is handling the case, said the trial date was not yet fixed.

Court spokeswoman Olga Dyachuk said last year that he was detained because the judge 'took into account that Rakossi is accused of a grave crime which can result in him being jailed for 20 years, or for life, and concluded that there is every reason to believe that the charged person might try and escape.'

Rakossi - held inside a pre-trial jail in the Russian city of Tula - looks pale after his time on the run, our pictures show.

He has a daughter, Yevgenia, 32, in Russia from a previous relationship.

'He really wouldn't have done anything like this,' she said of 'complete nonsense' claims that he killed the two women.

He is being held at the Temporary Detention Center for Suspects and Accused in Tula.

Larisa's son Ryan, then three, was left motherless after her murder.

The Russian constitution prevents the extradition of its citizens so 'Rambo' will face trial in Tula region.

After reaching Moscow, Rakossi vanished, with sources saying relatives helped hide him for more than two years.

The case is now under the supervision of the Russian Investigation Committee, equivalent of the FBI.

While Russian laws forbid the country’s citizens being extradited, New York Post reported he will face trial in his homeland based on evidence supplied by the U.S.

Andrei Yartsev, chief spokesman of Tula police, said: 'The results of the American side’s investigation were passed to the Russian General Prosecutor’s office so that the person can be charged with a criminal offense.' 

In March 2012, Prikhodko's other daughter Svetlana Prikhodko spoke exclusively to MailOnline.

She believed Rakossi was being hidden by family and friends in Russia, in the grim industrial city of Novomoskovsk where he owns an apartment and where one neighbor claimed to have seen him since the double killing.

'I have no doubt it was him, none at all,' said the neighbor, asking to remain anonymous for her own safety. 'He looked worried and tense.'

Svetlana told New York Post she and her family believe Rakossi led a sinister double life in New York, and he killed his wife and stepdaughter because they found out about it. 

'The facts point to something far darker and more sinister than anyone could have imagined,' she said.

'The quiet subdued Rakossi was living a double life ever since the moment he landed in the U.S.

'Arriving on a tourist visa, he charmed Tatyana and soon asked her to marry him and became part of the family.'

The family said they did not have 'a clear picture of what Rakossi was doing during these 11 years. He never held a regular job and claimed that he did construction work on the side.'

Svetlana said she suspected his annual trips to Russia where he kept an apartment and car.

It was claimed that on the day of the murders, Rakossi was repeatedly on the phone to Russia, both before and after the killings.

'Rakossi made almost 20 phone calls to Russia, starting at 5.30am, though typically he seldom called anyone,' a source told MailOnline.

'The calls were only briefly interrupted at 2.40pm for ten minutes when he committed the first murder. He then resumed calling until 3.40pm when Larisa walked in, resulting in, another ten minute interruption in the calls.'

New York Post reported Rakossi had called his sister Lydia, 62, who lives in Novomoskovsk, soon after the killings.

'He was in tears. He told me: ‘Please don’t keep any offence in your heart about me. Forgive me. You will never see me again',' she said. 'Then he ended the call.'

Lydia said she didn't hide her brother in Russia. 

The killings were carried out clinically, without a single scream to alert neighbors in the block.

'Who was this Rakossi that he allegedly knew how to handle a knife so expertly and kill an adult without even a cry from the victim?' a neighbor said.

'And what animal must he be to murder a young mother as she opened the door to her mother's apartment an hour later? What possible monstrous force and deed could have caused such an act of violence?

'No one deserves the horrible end that Larisa and Tatyana met.'
