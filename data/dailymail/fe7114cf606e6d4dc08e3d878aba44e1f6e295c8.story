Eighty drivers a day are being snapped by a new speed camera on the M4 motorway, generating £450,000 worth of fines, it has emerged.

The traffic camera is on a notoriously busy stretch of road and has already snapped 4,500 motorists in a two month period. 

Drivers had been used to slowing down for a fixed camera in the 50mph zone at Port Talbot, South Wales.

But since November last year, it has been replaced with an 'average speed' check - meaning motorists have to drive more cautiously. 

Chris Hume, from GoSafe, the Wales Road Casualty Reduction Partnership, said he was 'disappointed' by drivers speeding between junctions 40 and 41 of the motorway.

He said: 'Excessive and inappropriate speed remains a factor in collisions, associated fatalities, serious injuries and, in this case, also contributes to the traffic congestion.

'On average day there are still 80 motorists showing a complete disregard for the speed limit and putting lives at risk.'

Drivers who are caught will either get three points on their licence with a £100 fine or the option of a speed awareness course for £85. 

The new cameras measure the speed at which a vehicle is travelling by tracking it over a set distance.

Using data from several locations, it can tell how fast a motorist is driving based on its average, rather than at a set moment.
