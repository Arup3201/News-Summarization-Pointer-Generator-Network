A breathless Cup tie was over, the underdogs had taken the victory they deserved, and the Palace fans believed they knew precisely where the credit lay. 'Super Alan Pardew!' they sang, time and time again. And as the new manager clapped his hands and took his bow, nobody could deny him the credit. In a few short weeks, Pardew has created a formidable side from a formless rabble, and this latest success was the most dramatic evidence yet.

The tie was decided on the balance of five goals in a gloriously bewildering first half. And it was decided in favour of the better equipped, more adventurous football team. So thrilling was the performance, so beguiling the possibilities that Pardew spoke of amended ambitions. He looked at the mass cull of the giants, and he became thoughtful. 'I want to stay in the Premier League, so the Cup wasn't high on my priority list', he said. 'But when you get in the last 16, things change'.

Such a performance can provoke those kind of dreams. For Palace were genuinely impressive, the sheer pace of Marouane Chamakh and Yaya Sanogo constantly disrupting a strangely fallible Southampton defence and the guile of Wilfried Zaha delivering the kind of performance which Pardew knew was within him.

Ronald Koeman was suitably embarrassed by the frailty of his side. 'They talk about our organisation being one of the strengths of this team. Not today', he said. 'You can't defend like that. It was very poor, very poor'. There was no attempt at excuse, for excuses would have been distinctly difficult to find. For a club which might, with justice, have had their sights set on Wembley, it was a shattering disappointment.

That remarkable first half gave us goals beyond reason, with two teams geared to attack, scoring virtually at will against defences which obliged them with space and time and all the mod cons which Premier League teams rarely supply so generously.

Palace in particular played with a zest and a freedom which had so recently seemed way beyond their means. But their confidence is tangible, and it was not dented when Southampton opened the scoring in eight minutes with the simplest of goals. A left wing corner from James Ward-Prowse swirled through the defence and Graziano Pelle was allowed the simplest of chances.

Palace conducted a brief inquest, shrugged and set about settling the score. Satisfaction arrived within three minutes, when Zaha played in his ally Sanogo. The shot was parried by Fraser Foster and Chamakh devoured the rebound. Chamakh's speed proved far beyond the resources of the Saints defence, and a ball played into the path of Dusan Tadic almost brought Palace the lead they deserved. Yet in 16 minutes, they were behind once more, as Ryan Bertrand crossed low and fierce to the near post and Scott Dann's plunge diverted the ball into his own net.

On such a day, and in such a mood, it was no more than a temporary hitch. And it was avenged inside four minutes when, from a long clearance, Zaha picked out Sanogo, the home defence once again declined to do its job, and the striker accepted the simplest of driven goals. Four in the first 20 minutes: the neutrals were delighted, the home fans disturbed. For a side which has spent its season scrapping for survival was tearing them apart with acute pace and intelligent movement.

In 38 minutes, that side took the lead, as they had long threatened. It was Zaha again, discovering the space, sensing the danger points and creating the chance from which Chamakh scored emphatically. St Mary's grew thoughtful. They are not used to being treated in this fashion with the team Koeman has created.

At half time, Florian Gardos was removed from the fray as the nominated scapegoat – 'I wasn't happy about his performance today', said Koeman. In truth, he could have removed any number of suspects in midfield and defence, such was their ineffectiveness.

But the improvement their fans demanded was pitifully slow to arrive. Palace looked organised, their tactics uncomplicated. On the days when their assurance is instinctive and their passing flows, Southampton can be as accomplished as almost any side in England. But, as Koeman said, this was not such a day. Their approach was overly complicated, their chances were rare. And their luck was running perilously low; having brought on Shane Long for Jack Cork in 59 minutes, they lost Long to suspected broken ribs after a clash with Joel Ward 13 minutes later.

Yet still they might have salvaged their cause in the 88th minute, when a corner was shuffled to Eljero Elia on the fringe of the area. He drive was struck with vicious intent, but Wayne Hennessey's flying save was a small miracle of agility. The chance was lost, and so was Southampton's Cup tie.
