OId rivalries die hard between the Germans and the Brits - particularly when it comes to bagging the best spots by the pool on holiday.

But in a twist on the stereotype, a new poll suggests that tan-thirsty Brits are now twice as likely to reserve a sunlounger with a towel than German holidaymakers.

But, as if to restore the balance of the world, statistics show that one in 10 Germans think it is OK to wear socks with sandals.  

Happiness is... Brits are now twice as likely to reserve a sunlounger with a towel than German holidaymakers, even though more Germans (20 per cent compared to 12 per cent of Brits)

Germans holidaymakers also spend more, drink less and travel to more exotic destinations during their precious down time, although a worrying 10 per cent still think it's acceptable to wear socks underneath their sandals, even in blisteringly hot weather.

According to the survey by comparison website TravelSupermarket, Germans will spend an average of £1,582 on their main family holiday this year, 23 per cent more than penny-pinching Britons who will spend around £1,291.

German holidaymakers will also be enjoying a longer break than their fellow British travelers, spending around 12 days away, compared to 10, and they're also more likely to squeeze in an additional short-haul trip during the year. 

And while 50 per cent more Germans will be hoping to travel to far-flung destinations such as Asia, and Curacao in the Caribbean this year, twice as many Brits  as Germans (32 per cent versus 14 per cent) will be making do with a staycation.

When it comes to drinking on holiday, however, there is no competition. Around 25 per cent of British holidaymakers admit to drinking more while on vacation, compared to just nine per cent of our more restrained German neighbours.

Good style never takes a holiday: 10 per cent of Germans still think it's acceptable to wear socks underneath their sandals, even in blisteringly hot weather

And with diet and exercise high on the agenda at this time of year, it seems that the Germans enjoy healthier holidays than their British counterparts, with over a third admitting that the chance to be more active is a motivating factor when choosing a family break. 

Bob Atkinson, travel expert from TravelSupermarket said: 'Despite the fact that Brits get better value for money on their holiday purchases, it’s interesting to see that Germans are more adventurous in their holiday choices. Brits tend to talk about German holiday habits in jest, but instead, they could do well to take a leaf out of the book of their European cousins.

Come fly with me: German holidaymakers tend to travel further afield than their British counterparts

Home is where the heart is: While 50 per cent more Germans than Brits will be sunning themselves in far-flung destinations such as Asia, and Curacao in the Caribbean, 32 per cent of Brits will enjoy a staycation

'If you’re considering following in the footsteps of German holidaymakers, it’s worth doing your research to find out what would suit you best. 

'You can pick one of the new Ryanair services opening up the Atlantic islands of the Azores - great for walking, whale watching and sunbathing. 

'Or why not try an active holiday in a long-haul destination such as Tanzania with an organised ascent of Kilimanjaro, a restful beach break in the Indian Ocean paradise of Zanzibar or perhaps a fly drive to the US states of Rhode Island or Oregon, home to Portland and the film set for TV cult classic Twin Peaks.'
