Nike has suspended its endorsement deal with NFL star Adrian Peterson - just hours after the Minnesota Vikings deactivated him and ordered him to stay away from the team.

'Nike in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and has shared our concerns with the NFL,' the apparel giant said in a statement today.

Nike is the latest company to distance itself from Peterson and the Vikings after the former NFL MVP was arrested over the weekend on charges he severely whipped his four-year-old son with a wooden switch - leaving wounds all over his body.

On Wednesday, Vikings owners backtracked on their decision to allow him back on the field and admitted it was a 'mistake' to announce on Monday that he would be allowed to play again.

Peterson must stay away from the team until after his trial on felony abuse charges - though he will still collect his $700,00-a-game salary.

Nike has suspended its endorsement of Adrian Peterson, one of the NFL's biggest stars

 smiling now: Adrian Peterson stepped out Tuesday wearing entirely Nike gear - one day before the company dropped its sponsorship of the star

'Made a mistake': Mark Wilf, co-owner of the Minnesota Vikings, offered up a mea culpa on Wednesday and announced that Adrian Peterson would be off the team until after his trial

'We made a mistake. In the end, we are getting it right,' co-owner Mark Wilf said at a press conference today.

'We have to make sure that our reputation, and the team, was moving in the right direction.'

The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, effectively booting him from the roster - finally bowing to pressure from outraged fans and fleeing sponsors.

Nike stores in the Twin Cities pulled all of their Adrian Peterson jerseys from shelves on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Minneapolis-based Target announced its stores were pulling his jerseys, as well.

Castrol Motor Oil was the first of 
Peterson's major sponsors to drop him, announcing Tuesday that the 
contract was suspended. On Monday, Radisson Hotels said it was 
suspending its endorsement deal with the Vikings after owners allowed 
Peterson back on the field following his arrest.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Radisson's logo - normally ubiquitous - was noticeably absent.

Some
 of the NFL's top corporate sponsors like Anheuser-Busch, Visa and 
McDonald's, had also voiced disapproval over the league's treatment of 
its player scandals - including the decision to allow Peterson to 
continue to play.

Peterson was pictured yesterday leaving his
 Minnesota home to join his teammates for practice.

But the Vikings announced it was reversing 
its decision early today after a time of 'further reflection' on the 
issues surrounding the case.

Peterson is charged with using a wooden switch to spank his son. The Vikings kicked him off their roster for one game - but 
reinstated him on Monday. They have now banned him again after pressure from the pubic

The Vikings came under heavy criticism for their initial stance, notably from sponsors.

'We are disappointed and increasingly 
concerned by the recent incidents that have overshadowed this NFL 
season,' Anheuser-Busch, the makers of Budweiser and Bud Light beer, 
said. 

'While we were trying to make a balanced decision yesterday, after further reflection we have concluded that this resolution is best for the Vikings and for Adrian,' owners Zygi and Mark Wilf said in a statement.

'We want to be clear: we have a strong
 stance regarding the protection and welfare of children and we want to 
be sure we get this right.

'At
 the same time we want to express our support for Adrian and acknowledge
 his seven-plus years of outstanding commitment to this organisation and
 this community.'

Grinning: Peterson smiled in his mugshot after he was arrested Saturday on child abuse charges

The 
stunning reversal comes after a harrowing day on Tuesday that included 
the Radisson hotel chains suspending its sponsorship with the Vikings.

Castrol
 Motor Oil, Special Olympics Minnesota and Mylan Inc., all severed ties 
with Peterson, while Twin Cities Nike stores pulled Peterson's jerseys 
from their shelves.

In addition, Anheuser-Busch issued a strongly worded statement that said it was disappointed in the way the NFL was handling all of the negative attention surrounding former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice's assault of his then-fiancee.

The rebuke could raise pressure on NFL
 Commissioner Roger Goodell, who is already struggling to make amends after his
 initial light punishment of former Baltimore Ravens star Rice for 
punching his then-girlfriend, now his wife, in February.

The
 NFL and team owners are also dealing with at least three other domestic
 abuse cases and a wide swath of Americans are closely watching how they
 react to mounting public pressure to take forceful measures with 
players who engage in domestic violence.

When a security video 
emerged last week of Rice knocking his wife out cold, Goodell suspended 
Rice indefinitely and said he had not seen that video when he handed 
down his original two-game ban in July.

He had, however, seen a previous video showing Rice dragging an unconscious Janay Rice out of the elevator.

Goodell apologized for his initial punishment and has since increased the mandatory ban to six games for domestic violence.

After
 the second video emerged and reports that the NFL had seen it, the 
league ordered an independent investigation into the handling of the 
Rice case.

Rice, 27, has until midnight ET on Tuesday to appeal his suspension.

Peterson has said he was disciplining his son and didn't intend to hurt him.

his arrest for severely whipping another of his children with a wooden 
switch. Above, police released these images of the boy's wounds

Nike also sponsors Vikings team uniforms - in addition to forging an individual endorsement deal with Peterson

'This is the best possible outcome given the circumstances,' Peterson's agent, Ben Dogra, told The Associated Press.

'Adrian understands the gravity of the situation and this enables him to take care of his personal situation.

'We fully support Adrian and he looks forward to watching his teammates and coaches being successful during his absence.'

The Vikings said they had deliberations with the NFL over the previous two days and informed the league they were revisiting the situation.

'After giving the situation additional thought, we have decided this is the appropriate course of action for the organization and for Adrian,' the Wilfs said.

'We are always focused on trying to make the right decision as an organization.

'We embrace our role - and the responsibilities that go with it - as a leader in the community, as a business partner and as an organisation that can build bridges with our fans and positively impact this great region.

'We appreciate and value the input we have received from our fans, our partners and the community.'
