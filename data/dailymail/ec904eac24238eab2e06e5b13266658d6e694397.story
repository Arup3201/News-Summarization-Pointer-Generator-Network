They say a man forms a special bond with his first car - and one man pensioner proved the strength of that devotion by tracking down his classic motor for a second time, 61 years after he first bought it.

After saving for months, 17-year-old Brian Rollings bought the car of his dreams in 1953 - a 1936 Austin Opal Tourer.

The young engineer bought the second-hand car for £140, and spent hours polishing the bright red convertible, which even helped him woo his wife-to-be.

Reunited: Brian Rollings, 77, managed to track down his beloved first car and restore it

Decay: The car was rusted and decaying after years of neglect when Mr Rollings tracked it down

The famous model - known as the 'baby Austin' - was wildly popular when first manufactured, and remains much-loved today.

In 1955 Mr Rollings reluctantly traded the car in for a larger alternative, but never forgot about his first ride.

Decades after the fateful sale his passion for classic cars led him to strike up a search to see whether he could track down the old car and buy it back.

Miraculously, the search was successful and, aged 77, Mr Rollings was able to buy the Austin 7 back for £4,000.

In the 56 years since he had seen it the car had decayed considerably, but after three years of loving attention, it has been restored to its formerly glory. It has even passed its MoT.

Adored: The much-loved model even helped Mr Rollings woo his wife Sylvia

Mr Rollings, who has now retired and lives in Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'I bought the car from a greengrocer in Birmingham for £140 in 1953.

'I must have saved for months to find the money and I was worried someone else would snatch it up but when I drove it home for the first time I felt like a king.

'I sold it in 1955 after trading it in for a bigger car but I always regretted doing that. I loved the car and over the years I just wanted to get it back.

'I got into classic cars and bought a
 Rolls-Royce and a Mark VI Bentley convertible but I always hankered for
 the old 1936 Austin Seven.

'Finally I saw it advertised when I went to the Practical Classics Restoration Show at the NEC in 2011. I enquired about the car immediately but was devastated to learn it had been sold the day before.

Poor condition: Both the interior and the exterior of the car were in a bad way when Mr Rollings bought it back in 2011

Rusted: It took a lot of work to restore the car, a process which has cost some £10,000

Gutted: The car, which had turned a shade of orange, was completely stripped down and repainted

'It had been off the road for 40 years in a barn in Coleshill in Warwickshire. It was rotten and covered in toy teddy bears. I didn't recognise it. But when I saw the number plate my heart jumped.

'I was determined not to let it slip away. The purchaser had agreed the deal and, even though it was painted orange and in a very grim state, I knew I could get it back to how it used to be.

'I collected the car the following week and started on the restoration immediately. I was 75 when I got the car back so I felt time was of the essence.

'Then on November 4, 2012, just eleven months after the project began it passed its MoT first time. I love driving it around now. I feel exactly like I did when I was 17.'

Wife Sylvia, 77, a retired adminstrator, added: 'I always say to people that Brian loved two things in this life, me and that Austin Seven.

'I remember him driving me around when we first started courting and it is lovely to go out again and re-live all those wonderful memories.'

The Austin 7 - or 'Baby Austin' - was one of the first breakout success stories of British motoring.

Developed in the face of flagging fortunes from its manufacturers, the diminutive model lowered the cost of motoring and was a first car to thousands who had never driven before.

The car - which is so tiny it can fit on a billiards table - eventually sold 375,000 models, and the designed was licensed in countries including France and the USA, giving it even further reach.

A version of the classic car was also used in the BBC children's programme Brum, which saw an enchanted miniature Austin 7 come to life when its owner was away,
