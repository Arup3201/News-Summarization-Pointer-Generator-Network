Two weeks after Tiarna Middleton was born, her mother still has not been able to hold her daughter in her arms.

In desperate need of a transplant, the baby has become the youngest in the world to be fitted with an artificial heart – and all her parents can do is hold her hand as she fights for life.

Weighing 5lb 8oz, Tiarna was born with a rare condition that meant she was missing vital coronary arteries and the right side of her heart had not grown at all.

Parents Sharney Gray, 22, and Gary Middleton, 25, launched an appeal to 
encourage people to join the organ donor register in a bid to help find a
 donor for their daughter, and Tiarna became both the youngest and smallest baby on the UK transplant waiting list.

But no suitable donors have been found
 – and yesterday doctors pulled off a medical first by fitting the 
14-day-old with a ‘Berlin heart’ during a delicate ten-hour operation at
 the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle.

The 33lb machine supports the work of the heart and acts as a life-saving bridging device for children awaiting a transplant.

Mr
 Middleton, a freelance courier, said: ‘We have been on a total 
emotional rollercoaster and are taking each day as it comes. Tiarna is 
doing well in the circumstances.’

Tiarna
 was born with an extremely rare condition called hypoplastic right 
heart syndrome, which meant she had a blocked heart valve in the artery 
going to the lungs.

She
 was kept alive initially by an ECMO machine, which takes over the work 
of the heart and puts oxygen in the blood.

In the meantime, Tiarna was 
urgently listed for heart transplantation. To save her life, she would 
need the heart of a baby aged three months or younger.

Tiarna's parents are urging people to join the organ donor register in a bid to help their daughter and other people in a similar position to her

The child's mother said today:  'Anything can happen in the next 48 hours. She has nothing left to try so we hope this works.'

But
 ECMO is suitable only for short-term support, and with no donors 
available and time running out, surgeons decided to try to fit a Berlin 
heart as a last resort. They used a new small version of the device, 
delivered from The Berlin Heart Company in Germany where it is made.

Miss
 Gray said: ‘She’s the smallest person they’ve tried that  on. She has 
nothing left to try  so we hope this works. The  doctors at the Freeman 
have done everything for her.’

The
 couple from Gateshead, who already have a two-year-old son, Jamie, were
 told Tiarna would be born with a heart condition when she was in the 
womb and were asked if they wanted to continue with the pregnancy.

Tiarna was given the device during a 10 hour operation yesterday. It is hoped it will keep her alive long enough for a donor heart to be found so she can have a transplant

A Berlin 
heart is a device which can be used in people whose hearts are not 
strong enough to pump enough blood around their bodies.

It is used to allow time for a donor heart to be found.

It is an air driven pump which takes over the work of the person's own heart.

It can be used to take over the work of one or both sides of the heart.

The Berlin heart consists of a plastic chamber which sits outside the body.

It has a 
blood filled side and an air filled side and the blood filled side of 
the pump is connected directly to the child's own heart and main artery 
by two tubes.

It can be used for as long as several months but a person cannot remain on it indefinitely.

Miss
 Gray, a stay-at-home mother to their son, said: ‘We knew it was a very 
serious and very rare condition but I could feel her kicking so I wasn’t
 going to get rid of her.’

Tiarna
 was delivered by caesarean and doctors soon discovered that her 
coronary arteries had failed to form. Miss Gray said: ‘She was screaming
 for seven hours and we thought she was OK but then she started to have 
difficulty breathing and they had to perform CPR on her for 38 minutes.’

Medics said the Berlin 
heart would keep Tiarna alive for longer than an ECMO machine could 
have. It is possible to survive for as long as a year with the device, 
but Richard Kirk, consultant paediatric cardiologist and transplant 
physician at the Freeman Hospital, explained that was not desirable as 
the baby has to remain in hospital.

A heart transplant is still the only long-term solution for Tiarna.

Miss
 Gray said: ‘Now we are  just hoping someone will provide her with a 
heart, someone could save her life. We’re in a really  difficult 
position.

‘Babies under two 
months can’t be organ donors in this country. She could take the heart 
of a baby up to three months old but it all depends on weight and size. 
Time is just running out.’

She
 added: ‘I haven’t even held her, all I’ve been able to do is hold her 
hand. It is really frustrating. I can touch her but not pick her up.’

Dr Richard Kirk said: ‘We need to find a donor for her to go home and live a healthy and normal life.’
