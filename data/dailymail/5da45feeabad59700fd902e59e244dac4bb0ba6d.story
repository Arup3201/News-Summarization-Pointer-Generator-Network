With a contract worth £256,000 a week, a typical WAG would probably already be picking out the latest Louis Vuitton shoes to add to her collection.

But Emma Rhys Jones, the long-term partner of Gareth Bale - who today became the most expensive footballer on the planet - is more than happy to just put on her pajamas and curl up on the sofa with a nice glass of wine.

Friends and relatives of the polite family girl from Cardiff have insisted living life under the gaze of the media spotlight will definitely not change the 23-year-old.

Grounded: Fame is unlkely to change either Bale or Emma, who both prefer nights in to going out partying

Emma's neighbour Theresa Thomas said: 'Celebrity won't change Emma, no way. She and Gareth are just 
normal people that something extraordinary has happened to.'

Theresa remembered Emma and her brothers and sisters growing up.

She said: 'They were all such helpful friendly kids, nothing was too much trouble.

'I've never known them to be yelled at or throw wild parties. Their parents are very lucky.

Homespun girl: Rather than have her daughter, Alba, in London, Emma returned to her native Cardiff for the birth

'Emma's such a lovely girl. I've seen her and Gareth visiting many times.

'Their daughter, Alba, is the most gorgeous baby. Emma says she's a really good girl too - she even sleeps well.

'Gareth
 is not a show-off, even now that he is doing so well. He always helps 
her get the car seat out the car and is quite protective of his family.

'I
 don't think fame will affect them at all. They are a lovely, normal 
couple with fantastic supportive families. It just wouldn't be in their 
nature.'

Emma's grandmother Grace Rhys-Jones insisted she is definitely not a WAG.

'She's a well rounded young woman. We are so proud of her,' she said.

'She has fiery Italian roots - I'm sure if the opportunity to move to Italy ever came up Emma wouldn't say no.'

Emma
 is the second eldest of five children. She has one older sister, 
Charlotte, 24, a younger sister, Katie, 20, and twin brothers Robert and
 John, 19.

She first started dating Gareth when they were pupils together at Whitchurch High School in Cardiff when they were teenagers.

Bale's famous love heart celebration when he scores a goal is dedicated to Emma.

Their
 family life is said to be extremely close and Emma can often be found visiting her 
sisters, snuggled up in her pajamas or sharing a bottle of wine.

Katie
 describes Emma as her 'best friend and beautiful big sister' and 
organised a lavish baby shower in June last year when Emma was expecting
 her first child.

Then 
when baby Alba Violet Bale was born in October 2012, Emma returned home 
to Cardiff and gave birth at The University Hospital of Wales.

But
 friends say she is not interested in nightclubs or the celebrity 
life-style like the wives and girlfriends of other soccer stars.

A friend of the pair said: 'Gareth is a homebird and Emma's the same - they like a quiet life and their family is the most important thing to them.

'Emma is from a big family - they are close and supportive, she doesn't like being too far away from them.'

William Tout, 83, watched Bale grow up from the house next door.

He said: 'I saw Emma around a fair bit when Gareth was a teen.

'She's a really lovely girl. They'd both say a little hello in passing. Same with Gareth's parents. They're great neighbours. Really friendly people.'

It is this deep connection to family life that had critics speculating Bale would not leave north London club Tottenham Hotspur and its close proximity to the M4 for his bi-weekly trips over the Severn Bridge.

But now that the deal is finalised - while other footballing stars use their down time to jet set and mingle with A-listers around the world - Emma and Gareth will no doubt use their holidays to return to the open arms of home.

In 2011 Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said: 'I gave Gareth four days off last week because I thought he needed a break, and I told him to go abroad.

'But he went to Cardiff to his mum's. That’s him all over.'

This commitment to their roots has been a massive factor in maintaining their relationship.

After almost ten years together it is rumoured that the pair are engaged, but Bale notoriously keeps his private life a closely guarded secret.

The closest he's ever come to revealing a snippet was in 2011 when he told a reporter: 'I like looking after my family.'

Bale finally signed the £83.5million contract that made him the most expensive footballer ever in front of a stadium packed to the rafters with adoring Real Madrid fans.

In broken Spanish, the £85.3million player told a near 85,000 capacity stadium: 'It's a dream to be here and to play for Real Madrid. I appreciate this welcome.'

Bale flew to Madrid this morning for a medical. At about 12.30pm the softly spoken Welshman made his first public appearance as a Real Madrid player, a dream he had harboured since he was a boy.

Earlier today, the 24-year-old said: 'I know many players talk of their desire to join the club of their boyhood dreams, but I can honestly say, this is my dream come true.'
