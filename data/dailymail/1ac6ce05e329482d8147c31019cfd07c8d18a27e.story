After piling on the pounds for too long, this fat cat is now on a strict diet to help her find a new home.

Alanna, who lives in Warrington, Cheshire, tips the scales at a whopping one stone - more than 50 per cent heavier than a normal cat - and has been put on a New Year eating regime.

It is hoped she will now be able to beat the bulge in a bid to find a new family after her previous owner died earlier this month.

Previous owner died: It is hoped the animal will now be able to beat the bulge in a bid to find a new family

When she waddled into the Cats Protection adoption centre in Warrington, staff were immediately taken back by her monstrous appetite.

A spokesman said: ‘She’s a really friendly and playful but can’t run around like normal cats due to her podgy belly.  She’s certainly been over-eating, which can be quite common with elderly owners.

‘So we’ve put her on a new regime to get her fit and active in a bid to beat the bulge and hopefully fine a new home to take her. But any new owners will have to be strict about what they feed her.’

Needs help: Cats should weigh around 9lbs (4-4.5kg) but chubby kitty Alanna has weighed in at 1st (6.5kg) after gorging on milk, cream, cheese and even chocolate.

Issue: A Cats Protection survey of 1,120 cat owners last Christmas revealed around a quarter of Britain's cats were regarded by their owners to be overweight, yet continued to be fed too many treats

A Cats Protection survey of 1,120 cat owners last Christmas revealed around a quarter of Britain’s cats were regarded by their owners to be overweight, yet continued to be fed too many treats.

Sonia Sowcroft, north-west adoption centre manager, said: ‘It is advisable for owners to give cats treats that are specially formulated for cats and consider their cat’s total calorific intake.’
