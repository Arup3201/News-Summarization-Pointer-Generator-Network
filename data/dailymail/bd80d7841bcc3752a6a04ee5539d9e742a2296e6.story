Arrested: Alonzo Brown was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly kicking a woman down onto a sidewalk with her young son last week 

Targeted: The CCTV footage shows a man walking along a Bronx sidewalk behind Odila Orozco, who is carrying her son Jordy

Attack: He then approaches the Orozco from behind and kicks her in the back

Brown apologized to both the female victim and the baby - identified by WABC as Odila Orozco and her son Jordy -  while speaking to the affiliate station. He said he discovered the baby 'When [the woman] hit the floor.'

Brown has been charged with robbery, attempted robbery, assault, and act in a manner injurious to a child, WABC reported.

The infant was fastened on the 24-year-old victim's person when Brown rushed up in back of her before striking with his leg, police told WPIX.

The victim dropped onto the sidewalk while the 18-year-old allegedly picked up her phone and fled.

Orozco told WABC she rejected Brown's apology.

At the beginning of surveillance footage, released by the NYPD, a man is seen looking around.

He then spots Orozco and begins following her. As he approaches he lifts up his coat and then starts running at her before delivering a kick.

The clip shows Orozco then sprawled on the floor with a handbag to her side.

The man is then seen bending down to pick up the phone before fleeing.

As a result of the blow, Orozco landed with her weight on the child.

The pair were taken to hospital but have been released and are expected to be fine, WPIX reported.
