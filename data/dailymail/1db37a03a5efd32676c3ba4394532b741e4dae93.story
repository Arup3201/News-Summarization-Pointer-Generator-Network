Played: 11 

Man United: 7 

Arsenal: 1

Draws: 3 

Arsenal versus Manchester United has always been one of the stand-out fixtures in Premier League history – but the Gunners have only won one of the last 11 matches between the clubs.

Louis van Gaal will take his injury hit side to the Emirates on Saturday afternoon knowing that his team have recent history on their side.

Despite struggling last season, United beat Arsenal 1-0 at Old Trafford and then played out a goalless draw in north London.

Aaron Ramsey scored the only goal of the game the last time Arsenal beat Manchester United in 2011

While in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final season at Old Trafford, Robin van Persie and Patrice Evra scored in a 2-1 win at home while Van Persie also found the net on his return to the Emirates later that season to cancel out a Theo Walcott goal in a 1-1 draw.

Arsenal’s last win in the Premier League came back in May 2011 when Aaron Ramsey scored in a 1-0 home win.

Of the Arsenal team that day, five are still at the club, including goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, Laurent Koscielny, Walcott, Ramsey and Jack Wilshere.

But if Wenger is looking for some comfort then he need look no further than United’s away record, they are yet to win on the road this season and have not picked up three points on their travels since April 5 when they beat Newcastle 4-0.

In seasons gone by Arsenal vs Manchester United was a game that would often decide the title, but this year’s contest looks more likely to be the battle for fourth and the final Champions League place.

But more immediately, the Gunners will be hoping to end their poor run against United.
