A BBC radio DJ allegedly passed out live on air - six months after she was taken off her afternoon show for sounding drunk.

Paula White was conducting an interview with an exotic pets expert on BBC Radio Stoke when she passed out.

Fans of the show reportedly heard the 46-year-old star attempting to say the word 'exotic' moments before a song was played. When it finished, there was silence.

Live on air: Paula White, a presenter at BBC Radio Stoke, passed out while on air

It has been reported by The Sun that Ms White was unconscious in the studio for several minutes before paramedics arrived.

The host who usually follows her three-hour show, Den Siegertsz, stepped in early.

The BBC has now removed the recording of the show on the radio station's website. Ms White has been removed from the station's schedule also.

The BBC said: 'Paula White is unwell at the moment so is unable to present her Saturday morning show on BBC Radio Stoke. Den Siegertsz will be taking over for the time being'

In May, Ms White was taken off the air after listeners complained she sounded drunk.

After 30 minutes, a colleague took over and announced: ‘Paula is not feeling well and has gone home.’

At one point Ms White said: ‘It’s a P-A-R-T-Y because I said sooooo . . . Some people will say, “Oh, thank goodness she’s gone.”

The presenter later added: ‘Other people will say, “How will I get the dog to sleep because I know that people play this show out to their dogs.’”

Ms White, who repeatedly stumbled over her words, then announced she was junking the station’s official playlist and would allow listeners to choose their favourite songs.

She said: ‘Start your messages with . . . Stoke? Yes, start it with Stoke. I don’t care. Whatever you want to hear this afternoon, it’s like you can hear it.’

Responding to a listener who sent a text message to producers suggesting she was drunk, Ms White replied: ‘I’m not drunk, I’m not drunk. I’ve had a couple of drinks. I’m not drunk.’

Afterwards, the DJ said she would play the track Walking On Sunshine by Katrina And The Waves, adding: ‘This lady won Euro-vision for us a couple of years ago. She wasn’t with the sunshines or the waves.’
