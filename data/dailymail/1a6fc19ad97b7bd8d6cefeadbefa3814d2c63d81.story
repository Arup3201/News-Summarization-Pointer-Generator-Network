The world's oldest father has told of his devastation following the disappearance of his three-year-old, who he fears was kidnapped.

Ramjeet Ragav, 97, has not seen his son Vikramjeet for 55 days and they believe he was snatched during a visit to hospital.

Mr Ragav hit the headlines in 2010 when he was awarded the title of world's oldest dad after fathering Vikramjeet at the age of 94 with his wife Shakuntala, 60.

Lost: Vikramjeet disappeared on May 6 after his mother fell asleep at a bus station after 30km journey to hospital

Last October, Mr Ragav broke his own record by having second son Ranjeet, now nine-months-old, when he was 96, with wife Shakuntala, 60.

Photographs of the family were beamed all
around the world and images of their small house in the tiny village of Kharkhoda, in Haryana, 64km from the Indian 
capital of New Delhi.

But the family are bereft since their son disappeared.

Mr Ragav said: 'We've been searching for him every day. I feel helpless. He is our first son. We love him dearly. I don't know why or how he has disappeared.'

His wife travelled to the nearest hospital with Vikramjeet because had been suffering from a fever on May 6.

Tired after the 30km bus journey, she fell asleep on a bench inside a busy bus terminal with her son in her arms.

Terrified: Ramjeet Raghav, pictured with younger son Karamjeet, right, said the family have barely eaten or slept since his elder son Vikramjeet, pictured left, went missing

When she woke 15 minutes later, the boy was missing.

'I searched everywhere but there was no trace of him,' she said.

'I started crying and shouting for my son. I begged everyone and anyone for help. A crowd gathered to help, they started looking for him too but we still couldn't find him.'

A few hours later, she headed home without her son. When she returned and broke the terrible news to her husband, he was inconsolable.

The devastated family immediately filed a missing persons report with the local police.

Initially, neighbours of the family were questioned after reports claimed they were 'overfriendly' with the boy but investigations have so far proved fruitless and police say there are no suspects in the case.

Fear: The family are terrified their son has been kidnapped and sold on my notorious gangs operating in New Delhi

Poverty: Mr Ragav earns £35 a week as a farmer and the family live in a tiny hut in the village of Kharkhoda

Incomplete: Mr Rangav was broken the news at the family home (pictured) and he says he will not rest until he finds his son

Officer Balbir Singh, the investigating police officer, said: 'We’ve sent out alerts across the state and circulated the boy's pictures in all the police stations.

'There are no leads or suspects yet but we hope to find him as soon as possible.'

Gangs are known to abduct Indian children and traffic them into the sex trade and begging rings or force them to work as servants.

Former wrestler Mr Ragav, who now earns £35 a week from farm work, says he will not rest until he finds his son.

Struggling to hold back tears, Mr Ragav said: 'I'm so worried about him.

'We can't sleep or eat. We don’t know what to do next. We’re very scared.'
