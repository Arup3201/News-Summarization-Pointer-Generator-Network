An attempted grave robbing was today being investigated by police after thieves tried to access an elderly couple’s buried coffins.

The culprits dug a large hole next to the final resting place of Henry and Betty Brazil at Tredworth Road Cemetery in Gloucester - in a crime that was a throwback to the days of Victorian England.

Officers from Gloucestershire Constabulary said the suspects had tried to access their joint casket in a failed bid to get to the jewellery they were wearing when they were buried.

The couple’s distraught family only discovered the attempted theft after visiting the cemetery to pay their respects, finding someone had dug a 4ft deep hole, 3ft wide and 3ft long, next to their graves.

The offenders had even placed two recycling boxes upside down in the hole and laid earth across the top in an attempt to disguise their work.

Nothing was stolen but the family believe the offenders were after jewellery and other valuables contained in the buried casket.

Jenny Jones, Mr and Mrs Brazil’s daughter, said: ‘This is very upsetting. It’s like the dead can’t rest anymore. It’s not fair at all. All my brothers and sisters are distressed.

‘There’s someone at the grave pretty much every day at the moment to make sure this doesn’t happen again but we can’t keep that up forever. My message is, “Please, just let them rest”.’

The couple are buried alongside each other following Henry’s death in 2011 and Betty’s in 1996. No damage was caused to the casket but the family are now considering security measures at the grave.

Officers are appealing for anyone with information about the offence, which is known to have taking place at some point between 5pm on Sunday and 9.45pm on Monday.

A police spokesman said: ‘The offence took place between 5pm on Sunday September 1 and 9.45am on September 2.

‘While it is unknown if those responsible were trying to bury something or uncover something. The family believe they could have been after jewellery and other valuables contained in the casket.’

Ms Jones said her family were now visiting her parent’s grave every day in a hope the culprits would not come back to ‘finish what they started’.

She said: ‘When it happened I was in complete disbelief. We couldn’t believe what had happened - why would somebody do that to someone?

‘I just can’t understand why. The whole family is so upset about it all. We are just coming back up and down to the grave all the time now.

‘There is nothing else we can do really apart from just keep checking. The staff have said there is nothing they can do. We can’t even put cameras in because it is a public place.

‘We just don’t know what to do. We are visiting the grave every day at every time we can, early in the morning, late at night, whenever to stop whoever did this doing it again.’

'When it happened I was in complete disbelief. We couldn’t believe what had happened - why would somebody do that to someone?'

Ms Jones, who is one of seven siblings, added: ‘Staff didn’t know why they hole was there, they said they weren’t responsible for it at all.

‘Whoever did it tried to hide it, I believe they were coming back to finish what they started but hopefully they’ve stopped it. A grave is supposed to be a somewhere to remember, somewhere to put flowers, but in this case it’s not.’

In 2006 a gang of grave-robbing animal rights extremists were jailed after they dug up Gladys Hammond’s body and dumped it 20 miles away in a wood, in Hednesford, Staffordshire.
