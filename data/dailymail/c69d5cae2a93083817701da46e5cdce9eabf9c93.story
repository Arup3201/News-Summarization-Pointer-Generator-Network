Who should be England's next captain?

Bookmakers have already installed Wayne Rooney as favourite to be England’s next captain in the wake of Steven Gerrard’s international retirement. As if they had much choice.

It’s not through Rooney being the stand-out candidate, rather he is the best of an average bunch - as was painfully obvious with the dismal elimination from the World Cup after just two group games.

Rooney at least has the benefit of previous, short-lived captaincy experience for his country and has been Manchester United’s on-off skipper in recent years.

He may also be in the running to secure the armband full-time now that Rio Ferdinand has left Old Trafford.

That would certainly improve the 28-year-old scouser’s cause in the eyes of England boss Roy Hodgson. If it’s good enough for Louis van Gaal, then it should be good enough for Hodgson. 

On the international front, Rooney has played almost 100 games for his country and that sort of experience is invaluable, even if it is the experience of never winning anything.

When he made his senior international debut at the age of just 17 in February 2003, he was England’s youngest international cap. That’s an enviable record, although since eclipsed by Theo Walcott.

Rooney has matured on and off the field since those early days wearing the Three Lions and, as an established figure for club and country, now commands respect among his peers.

But his performance in England’s World Cup defeat by Italy, when cast out in an unfamiliar wide position, may have blotted his copybook in the eyes of the manager. A captain is expected to lead from the front, even when it does not suit, not sulk on the fringes.

If not Rooney, then who? Chelsea defender Gary Cahill is another early front-runner to carry the armband as Hodgson’s side look to banish the bitter memory of their dire campaign in Brazil.

Hodgson wants to rebuild with youth ahead of Euro 2016 and Cahill, like Rooney, is at just the right time in his career for the responsibility.

Hodgson, as a traditionalist, may prefer a defender to be barking orders as captain from the back rather than relying on a striker to get the message through on the field. Forwards can be detached from the action further back and that will form part of Hodgson’s thinking. 

While the late, great Bobby Moore is perhaps England’s most well-known and well-loved skipper, there have been strikers who have worn the armband in the post-war years. Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker share the distinction.

If Hodgson does not fancy a striker, he may fancy a goalkeeper even less. Joe Hart is another who tops the list of early favourites, but Ray Clemence or Peter Shilton he is not.

Experienced: Joe Hart has been England's established No 1 for some time

The Manchester City stopper was backed for the England captaincy by fans and pundits alike as far back as 2012, with many favouring a string of emphatic performances. But his form last season dipped and that leaves a question mark over his club future.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini sees £6million summer signing Willy Caballero as providing real competition for Hart next season and it would be a brave England manager who has as his captain a player not even guaranteed first-team football at club level.

Beyond the obvious front-runners, the strength of the England candidates tail off dramatically directly proportional to their number of caps.

Everton duo Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka have been thrown into the hat, for no other obvious reason, it appears, than they have played for their country.

Daniel Sturridge has yet to prove his maturity and consistency beyond a good season with Liverpool last time around.

And Jack Wilshere’s slender chances would appear to have gone up in smoke with that picture of him partying in Las Vegas so soon after England’s elimination from Brazil. Hart was also in that picture, which may perhaps have done his hopes even more harm than the fact he may not be playing for City next term.
