A man who claims to suffer from an extremely rare medical condition in which he was born with two penises has posted a picture online, attracting thousands of questions.

The anonymous man - who goes by the moniker 'DoubleD*ckDude' - spent more than six hours answering questions online after uploading the pictures to Reddit.

He claimed to suffer from a condition known as diphallia - where a boy is born with two fully-functioning penises, each capable of operating independently from the other - and included two pictures with the time and date.

The condition affects around one in every six million boys in the U.S. but most have one removed at an early age.

When he was asked how people react to his condition, he replied: ‘It varies from girl to girl.

‘Some have been like “wow”. Some have been like “that's fake!” Some have freaked out like, called me names.

‘Most are pretty curious but I don't have casual sex anymore, I stopped a few years back.’

Another asked whether he had ever considered having one penis removed.

He replied: ‘In my mid-teens, yeah. Now, hell no.’

He said he was glad his parents chose to
 not have one surgically removed, adding: 'Besides the ego boost it 
really makes a person feel special knowing there is likely no one else 
like you alive right now.'

He also said he has a great mom and his parents were helpful and supportive growing up.

The
 man, believed to be American, revealed in an 'Ask Me Anything' thread 
that he has one pair of testicles which split into two fully-formed 
penises that are individually able to achieve erection and climax.

The unnamed man, who is in a bisexual polyamorous relationship with a man and woman, explained that he could urinate or ejaculate simultaneously.

He met his now boyfriend and girlfriend when they were in a monogamous relationship and the three have been together, exclusively, ever since.

Having an extra penis has led to a range of sexual encounters with men and women, and he claimed that heterosexuals had been curious enough to take part in encounters.

'Mostly straight guys, and they always at the very least touch and play with them a little,' he posted.

He added that having an extra penis had opened him up to group sex encounters, and said he can use both at the same time, in two different lovers or the same person.

When asked about his most memorable sexual encounter he detailed an act involving six other people - three women and three men.

One of the only downsides of his condition, he said, was that it means his prostate gets full of seminal fluid that has to be released every few days.

When he was younger a urologist would perform the procedure, which involves reaching inside his anus and pressing on the prostate, but he said he can clear it himself now or has his boyfriend do it.
