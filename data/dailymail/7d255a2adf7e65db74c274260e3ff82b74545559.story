A border collie with a chronic leg condition that could have meant she would never walk again has been given a new leash of life - after getting a pair of miracle boots.

Nicky Prescott was devastated when her dog, Maddie, was diagnosed with severe Achilles tendon injuries, and was told it was unlikely she would fully recover.

But 10-year-old Maddie has stunned vets by fighting back, and is even winning agility competitions after specialists designed her a revolutionary pair of splint boots.

What an athlete! Maddie show off her recovery with a stunning jump

Ms Prescott, from Taunton, Somerset, said: 'We’re all astounded at Maddie’s recovery - in true paralympian style, she’s back out competing with the best of them.

'She has always been a really active dog, so it was devastating when we were told she had such terrible tendon injuries.

'She underwent an operation at Bristol Vet College which realigned the tendons - but they said she would re-injure them if she put any stress on them at all.

'I knew we wouldn’t be able to keep her still and was terrified she would re-injure herself.

'Her orthopedic boots are brilliant - she isn’t the least bit bothered about having her legs strapped up, and you wouldn’t know she was different from any other dog.

'I was a miracle just to have her walking again, let alone being able to run around competing in agility classes.

'She's not going to win crufts, but we can still go out and have fun in the veterans classes every weekend.'

Ingenious: The high-tech boots helped Maddie after her operation, and will now stop her injury recurring

Agility dog Maddie had been competing at a high level until she developed problems with her legs in 2009, making it difficult for her to walk. She underwent two operations to correct the ligaments at the University of Bristol Veterinary College in 2010, and got her boots soon after.

The amazing footwear was the work of OrthoPets, who make braces and prosthetics for injured pets. 

Rod Hunt, who created the boots, said: 'In simple terms, Maddie had injuries to the Achilles tendons in both hocks, which were fraying.

'Both required surgical repair, during which the damaged sections were effectively cut out and the "good" ends sutured back together.

'After this type of surgical procedure the hock needs to be immobilised for several weeks to allow the tendon to heal, which is normally achieved by pinning the joint. Typically, when the pin is removed the joint will be put into a hard cast for a further few weeks.

'The problem is that at some stage the joint will go from a fully immobilised state to a free-moving state and at that point there is nothing to stop the dog over-flexing the joint and re-injuring the newly repaired tendon.

'Dogs don’t understand bed rest or being careful. This problem is compounded if the dog is particularly fit, active and energetic - such as an agility Collie!

'The orthotics that we made for Maddie have served two functions.

'During the healing and rehabilitation phase, they allowed the amount of movement at the hocks to be controlled and progressively increased in line with how the tendons were healing, instead of the conventional all-or-nothing approach.

'Then, on an ongoing basis, they prevent over-flexion and the subsequent risk of re-injury to the tendons, especially during periods of high activity - such as agility.

'We are thrilled that we’ve been able to help her continue with a healthy and active lifestyle.'

Raring to go: Thanks to her orthotics, nothing stands between Maddie and a happy, active life
