Booming: Britons spend more than £1,200 each online every year, the most of any nation surveyed

The British spend far more online than any other nation in the world at an average of £1,175 per head, amid a dramatic shift in shopping habits.

The figure is far ahead of the rest of the world, including the USA, and some £307 more than in the second ranked country, Australia.

The shift has far-reaching implications for the nation’s high streets where tens of thousands of empty shops will need to be bulldozed.

Recent studies suggest the nation’s town centres need to be dramatically remodelled to bring in more housing, schools, gyms and community facilities.

Most people said the reasons for the shift to the web were because it was cheaper and easier, without the hassle, time and parking costs involved in going in to town.

Three in four people (73 per cent) with web access in the UK are buying goods for delivery over the internet at least once a month.

One in four do so every week, with internet shopping for groceries more developed in the UK than anywhere else in the world.

Smartphones, such as the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, with their access to the internet and online video have been adopted more enthusiastically in Britain than virtually any other country.

Some 71 per cent of mobile users access the internet on their handset, which ranks second only to Spain, where it is 75 per cent.

Companies trying to reach shoppers via advertising through smartphones are spending more per head in this country than anywhere else – at £8.04. Japan came in second with £7.50 per head, while it was an average of £6.74 in the US.

The internet is also changing the way 
we watch television. The British are most likely to access TV content 
over the web, with over a third (36 per cent) doing so every week.

Social networks, particularly Facebook, are among the most searched-for terms online, while the  photo sharing website ‘Instagram’ was the fastest growing term in the UK, the US, Canada, and Ireland.

The study, which was compiled by 
Ofcom, compared the internet, mobile and TV services across 17 countries
 across the world, including the U.S., much of Europe and the Far East.

It found that YouTube was the most popular website for online video content, with two-thirds of the nation’s laptop and desktop users visiting the site every month.

Ofcom said: ‘In recent years, we have found that the UK is the country where online shopping is most popular, with the highest spend per head of all of our comparator countries.’

The figure of at £1,175 per head in 2012 compares to £867 in Australia and £663 in the USA. At the other end of the scale, the figure was just £180 in Spain and £126 in Italy.

Total online web spending in this country was £74.3billion in 2012 and it appears likely to rise by at least another 10per cent this year.

In Britain, some 59 per cent of shoppers said it was cheaper to shop online, while 58 per cent said it was easier, 50 per cent argued it was quicker and 47 per cent felt it offered a better choice.

At one time, it was believed selling clothes online would never work because people like to try things on.

However the sale of clothes and shoes over the web is now among the fastest growing sectors, thanks to the success of firms like Asos and the department stores, which have easy returns policies.

The British were also most likely to trust web retailers and that goods bought online would be delivered speedily.

However, there are some concerns about delivery charges with four in ten saying they are too high, while three in ten had some concerns that purchases might not arrive.

Amazon suffered a backlash earlier this year when it scrapped free delivery on some items that cost less than £10. There have also been complaints about couriers and postmen dumping items in places where they may be stolen.

The research found that 19 per cent of Britons said they did not shop online more often because of concerns about collecting their item if they missed the delivery.
