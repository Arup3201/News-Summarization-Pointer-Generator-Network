With less than a month left until key state and federal elections, high-profile Democrats, including Vice President Joe Biden, First Lady Michelle Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton, are busying themselves campaigning for Democratic candidates, appearing alongside them at rallies and get-out-the-vote events.

Noticeably missing out front and center at similar events is another recognizable Democrat: President Barack Obama.

While the president has headlined a flurry of fundraisers for the Democratic Party's official campaign arms and at least one political action committee, individual candidates are keeping him at arm's length.

Clinton was the belle of the ball today in Arkansas, as he arrived back in home state to campaign for Democratic candidates

Obama, whose approval rating has been upside down for months, has not appeared at public events with current or aspiring federal lawmakers and statewide executives, and that's just the way they like it.

'I don’t need him campaigning for me — I need him to change some of his policies,' endangered Democratic Sen. Mark Begich when asked earlier this year if he'd welcome the president's presence on the campaign trail.

Kentucky's Democratic nominee to the Senate, Alison Lundergan Grimes, even released an ad explaining to voters that she is not Obama and disagrees with him on several issues important to her state.

Instead, Grimes has turned to former president Bill Clinton to help sell her candidacy to Kentucky voters.

Calling herself a 'Clinton Democrat,' Grimes has held two events featuring the retired politician. Last week he cut an ad for her - the first one he's done for the upcoming election. 

Hillary Clinton will also travel to Kentucky this month to campaign for Grimes, according to Politico, but it's not clear when or where they'll join forces.

Grimes is challenging Senate Minority Leader and longtime Kentucky politician Mitch McConnell for his Senate seat. The Clintons are friends of her father, Jerry.

The MinnPost reports that Bill Clinton also has plans to attend a rally in the North Star State this Friday for Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton and Sen. Al Franken.

This afternoon he returned to his home state of Arkansas to campaign for Sen. Tom Pryor.

Bill also stepped in as the headliner of a fundraiser for Maryland Lt. Governor Anthony Brown last week when Hillary cancelled after their only daughter Chelsea gave birth to her first child and made a surprise appearance at a Sept. 15 fundraiser for Georgia Sen. candidate Michelle Nunn.

Both Clintons traveled to Iowa last month to campaign for Iowa Congressman Bruce Braley, who is running for the state's open Senate seat, and other Democrats while appearing at retiring Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry.

After taking a few days of downtime to spend with her new grandchild, Hillary will be back on the road again this month, according to CNN, stumping again for Braley, as well as candidates in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado.

'Secretary Clinton is the right person at the right time for Democrats who are focused on turning out the vote and persuading undecided voters, particularly women, in the remaining days of the election,' Guy Cecil, director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told CNN.

Clinton's not just campaigning to help Democrats retain control of the Senate. On Thursday, she'll make a stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to campaign for that state's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Tom Wolf, who is challenging sitting Republican Gov. Tom Corbett.

She'll campaign for both New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Gov. Maggie Hassan when she travels there on Nov. 2, a Democratic source told CNN.  

Even first lady Michelle Obama, who notoriously dislikes campaigning, is lending her credibility to Democratic candidates.

Most recently she threw herself into the gubernatorial race in her home state of Illinois. Gov. Pat Quinn released an ad this morning featuring the first lady, and tomorrow she'll appear at a grassroots event with him in Chicago.

She'll also make a stop in Wisconsin on Tuesday to headline a rally for Mary Burke, who hopes to defeat Republican Gov. Scott Walker in November. The first lady has already done one event for Burke, a voter mobilization rally, on Sept. 29. This will be her second trip to the consequential state in just over a week.

On Friday she made trips to Massachusetts and Maine to stump for the state's respective Democratic gubernatorial candidates, Martha Coakley and Congressman Mike Michaud.

Vice President Joe Biden has also been summoned onto the campaign trail and will head to California tonight to attend an event for congressional candidate Amanda Renteria and Secretary of State candidate Alex Padilla, according to the White House. 

Wednesday he'll campaign with Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, and Thursday he'll stump for Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell.

Meanwhile, President Obama will travel to New York, Connecticut and California for Democratic National Committee and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraisers.

He'll attend a private fundraiser at actress Gweneth Paltrow's home on Thursday in Los Angeles and an intimate event with high-dollar donors at the home of restaurateur Michael Chow and his wife Eva in San Francisco on Friday, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

the candidate who is up for reelection this fall and was willing to be seen with Obama earlier this summer, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, appears to have accidentally run into president.

Obama dropped into a bar that Hickenlooper used to own after meeting with supporters nearby during a July visit to Colorado, and the governor just happened to be hanging out there. 

Upon bumping into each other at the bar, the Democratic politicians grabbed a beer together and faced off in two rounds of pool, at Hickenlooper's invitation.

The Colorado governor did not attend any official events with Obama during the trip, citing scheduling conflicts, however, and the state's Democratic senator, Mark Udall, who is also up for reelection, cancelled an appearance with Obama   on the day of, opting to stay in Washington, D.C., instead.

Obama had to go stag to the money-raising event that Udall was a host of and partly benefited his reelection campaign.
