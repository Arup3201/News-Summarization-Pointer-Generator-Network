The Geneva offices of HSBC were raided by Swiss prosecutors yesterday in an investigation into alleged money laundering.

Public prosecutors said they were searching for evidence of ‘aggravated money laundering’ after ‘the recent published revelations ’ about HSBC’s Swiss private bank.

It is the latest damaging twist for the banking giant embroiled in a scandal over claims staff helped rich clients dodge tax.

Under suspicion: Olivier Jornot, Prosecutor General of the Canton of Geneva, updates the media about the money-laundering investigation into HSBC's Swiss private bank after searching its offices in Geneva

The raid follows reports that HSBC also helped hide millions of dollars for arms dealers and blood diamond traders.

It comes seven years after its former IT worker Herve Falciani fled Geneva with details of thousands of clients suspected of avoiding tax in their home countries, including 6,000 Britons.

Although the Geneva prosecutor’s office said the probe was against the bank, it added that it could target individuals ‘suspected of committing or participating in acts of money laundering.’

Those found guilty could face a fine and up to five years in prison.

Authorities in France, Belgium, the US and Argentina have already launched criminal inquiries.

The investigation comes just over a week after HSBC Switzerland found itself at the centre of a massive global scandal following the publication of secret documents that claim to show it helped people avoid tax

In an unusual move, the Geneva prosecutor’s office alerted the media about the raid. This meant camera crews filmed attorney general Olivier Jornot and his staff arriving at HSBC’s offices overlooking Lake Geneva.

Another raid was carried out on its office near the city’s airport. Mr Jornot said: ‘What we are looking for today is not yet proof. What we are looking for are all documents, all information which will then allow us to make an analysis.’

Mr Jornot added that Swiss law did not allow an investigation based on stolen evidence but his office could investigate if it secured the evidence itself.

The raid comes more than a week after allegations emerged that HSBC’s Swiss private bank may have routinely helped wealthy clients dodge tax and hide assets.

Files including the names of 30,000 account holders including celebrities, were leaked. They claimed huge sums were channelled through HSBC as customers dodged taxes or laundered proceeds of crime.

Last week, a leaked memo revealed that HSBC was willing to help a ‘blood diamond’ trader even though he was being investigated for tax evasion. The term refers to uncut gems smuggled out of Africa and sold to fund brutal civil wars.

HSBC said its private banking operation has been overhauled and accounts of suspect clients closed.

A spokesman said: ‘We have co-operated continuously with the Swiss authorities since first becoming aware of the data theft in 2008.’

'Decent': Clive Bannister

Former HSBC executive Clive Bannister – the son of four-minute-mile legend Sir Roger – could face questions from the Geneva public prosecutor.

The 55-year-old spent 17 years at the bank and was the boss of its global private banking business from 1998 to 2006.

Oxford-educated Mr Bannister, a father of three sons who is also a keen runner, was based in London. He was instrumental in turning the private bank into a global powerhouse with profits soaring to almost £1billion by 2007.

HSBC’s Swiss private bank was a key part of his empire. Although there is no suggestion Mr Bannister was aware of any wrongdoing, the alleged misconduct occurred from 2005-2007, overlapping part of his service. Prosecutors may also choose to summon former trade minister Lord Green, who joined David Cameron’s government in 2011.

He was the chief executive and then chairman of HSBC until stepping down in 2010 and sat on the board of the Swiss banking arm for a decade.

Sources close to Mr Bannister describe him as a ‘incredibly decent man’ and point out he has not been interviewed during other investigations into HSBC in Belgium, France and the US.

But the controversy has touched his current role as chief executive of insurance firm Phoenix Group as his chairman Sir Howard Davies has asked him to explain his role at HSBC.

HSBC were willing to help a 'blood diamond' smuggler even though they knew that he was being investigated over tax evasion, according to a leaked memo. 

The bank aided Emmanuel Shallop before he was convicted for his part in an illegal trade that fuelled war in Africa.

According to one memo seen by the Guardian, one banker said: 'The client is currently being very careful because he is under pressure from the Belgian tax authorities who are investigating his activities in the field of diamond tax evasion.' 

HSBC bankers also helped him open a bank account in Dubai.

Blood diamonds were rough, uncut gemstones, smuggled out of Africa and sold to fund civil wars.

The main countries involved were Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, The Democratic Republic of Congo and the Ivory Coast.

Emmanuel Shallop used his company Shallop Diamonds to trade conflict diamonds for Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leaders in Sierra Leone.
