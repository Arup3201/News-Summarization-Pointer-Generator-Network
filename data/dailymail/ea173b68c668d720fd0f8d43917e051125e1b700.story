A casino regular has become Townsville's newest half millionaire after she hit the jackpot on the pokies.

The woman's $500,000 win happened at Jupiters Casino in the VIP lounge just before 9pm on Saturday.

Jupiters chief operating officer Will Keiler said he was excited the money had gone to a Townsville resident.

'I'm very pleased that itâ€™s gone to one of our local members, that way it stays in our community, it's not somebody who has come through on a quick visit and taken the money out of Townsville,' Mr Keiler told MailOnline.

The woman said she wished to remain anonymous.

Because of the size of the jackpot no coins came out of the pokie machine, Mr Keiler said.

'There would have been a lot of noise from the machine, when you hit the major jackpot there's a lot of music,' he said.

'Everybody around her would have known that it came up.'

The jackpot has now reset to just over $430,000.

The casino has given away jackpots of more than $500,000 twice before, in August 2008 at $750,000 and in March 2009 at $523,000.

The casino has 353 pokie machines, 26 tables and 20 fully automated table games machines.
