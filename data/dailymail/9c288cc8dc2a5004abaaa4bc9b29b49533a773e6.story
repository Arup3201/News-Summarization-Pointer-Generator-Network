Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was presented with a framed collection of photographs from his time with Monaco by vice-president Vadim Vasilyev as he made his return on Monday.

Wenger faces the club he first managed in 1987 on Tuesday night when Arsenal try to overturn their 3-1 defeat from the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.

The Frenchman left Monaco in 1994, six years after winning the Ligue 1 title in his debut season, but Wenger will put sentiment aside as he tries to inflict defeat on the club he still remembers fondly.

Wenger, ahead of his first competitive return to Monte Carlo, said: 'For me personally, it’s a very special moment. 

'I was a young coach here and was here for seven years. But tomorrow we have a Champions League game and the experience I gained here can help me.

'I am able to separate the importance of the game for my club and the pleasure I have at coming back. 

'The best way to enjoy it most is to do well and to turn it around. 

'My real pleasure would be to come back here more to see friends when there is not a match. I’m here for work and job is for the club to win.

'I have lots of respect for Monaco and I want to thank the club because they gave me my chance as a young trainer.'

Wenger's seven years in Monaco saw him deliver the title in 1988 and the Coupe de France in 1991, but he will have to make history again on Tuesday night if Arsenal are to qualify.

No team in the Champions League era have come back from a two-goal home deficit in the first leg and gone through. 

The last team to do so was Ajax in 1969 when they came from behind against Benfica and went through following a replay.

Even worse for Arsenal is Monaco have not conceded three goals at home in a match for three-and-a-half years, and Wenger has his work cut out for him at his former club.
