A lesbian couple are suing a hotel for discrimination after claiming the owner denied them a room because of their sexuality.

Diane Cervelli, 42, and Taeko Bufford, 28, tried to book a room at Aloha Bed & Breakfast in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2007.

But when Ms Cervelli informed owner Phyllis Young that the California couple would only need one bed, she was asked if it was because they were lesbians, according to a lawsuit filed yesterday.

Ms Young then said she was uncomfortable having lesbians in her house because of her religious views, it is claimed.

Refusing to let the couple book a room 
was solely based on their sexual orientation because the owner indicated
that if they were married, she would still not have allowed them to stay 
there, according to their attorney Peter Renn.

She also would have had a problem if they were an unmarried 
heterosexual couple, he added.

It
is claimed the business violated Hawaii's public accommodation law 
prohibiting any inn or other establishment that provides lodging from 
discriminating based on sexual orientation, race, sex, gender identity 
or expression, religion, ancestry or disability.

The
couple ended up booking a room elsewhere in Honolulu, but the 
experience with the bed and breakfast 'soured' their trip, Ms Cervelli 
said yesterday.

She said: 'In my past experiences in Hawaii, people have been so friendly.

'It was just hurtful. It made me feel we weren't good enough.'

The couple have finally been given the go-ahead to take legal action against Aloha Bed & Breakfast (pictured), four years after the alleged incident in 2007

Ms Young declined to comment yesterday, She is being legally represented by the Alliance Defense Fund, an organisation of attorneys representing people whose religious freedom is infringed.

According to the lawsuit, the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission has investigated the incident.

During the investigation, Ms Young told the commission that homosexuality is 'detestable' and 'defiles our land'.

The commission issued a notice of 'reasonable cause to believe that unlawful discriminatory practices have been committed' and notified the couple of their right to sue.

The lawsuit wants the business to be ordered to comply with the law, for the court to issue a declaration making clear what happened was illegal and for the couple to be awarded unspecified monetary compensation,

Mr Renn, the couple's lawyer, said: 'No amount of money is going to erase the humiliation and pain.'

He added that he is looking into whether Aloha Bed & Breakfast is licensed to operate as it is not on a list of properties approved as a transient vacation unit or for bed and breakfast use.
