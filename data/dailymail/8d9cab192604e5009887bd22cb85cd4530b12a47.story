The chances of beating cancer in England still lag behind those elsewhere in Europe, official figures revealed yesterday.

And although survival rates for many common cancers are improving, for some types of tumour they have slid backwards despite millions of pounds being invested in research and treatments.

Data from the Office for National Statistics show that in 2012 the percentage of patients still alive five years after diagnosis had improved for nearly all cancers, compared to the situation in 2011.

Cancer survival rates are improving, including breast cancer which has risen from 85 per cent to 85.8 per cent, prostate from 81.7 per cent to 83.6 per cent and bowel from 57.3 per cent to 57.6 per cent

This includes breast cancer, which rose from 85 per cent to 85.8 per cent, and prostate cancer, up from 81.7 per cent to 83.6 per cent.

Overall, for 19 of the 24 most common cancers, patients saw improvements in survival rates thanks to earlier diagnosis and advances in treatment.

Yet for five types they stalled or got worse, including bladder cancer in women, thyroid cancer in both sexes, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women and mesothelioma in men.

There is no explanation as to why – and in all cases it has only been a very small decline. However, waiting times for vital tests to diagnose cancer have gone up recently as the NHS struggles to cope with the rise in patients coming forward.

Campaigners said that, despite the overall improvement, England is still well behind France, Germany and Scandinavia in its survival rates.

This has been partly blamed on GPs missing warning signs, and patients not making an appointment when they first experience symptoms.

Experts say this is because women are more likely to see their GP early with symptoms whereas men ignore them and hope they’ll go away.

‘Cancer is not yet fixed, we can – and must – be trying to save more lives.

Nick Ormiston-Smith, head of statistical information at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This increase in survival shows the power of research - thanks to better treatments, earlier diagnosis and greater awareness more people are surviving cancer than ever before.

‘But the story's not so positive for all types of cancer - lung, pancreatic, oesophageal cancer and brain tumours still have relatively low survival rates, partly because they tend to be diagnosed at a later stage when they're much harder to treat.

Over the summer, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged to name and shame GPs who were missing cancer on the NHS Choices website.

He wants surgeries which don’t sent patients urgently for scans to be identified with a red-flag.

Although cancer survival rates are improving, Britain still lags behind many other European countries. For example, breast cancer survival rates in France and Sweden are 86 per cent

It follows an initiative by the Government in 2011 to invest an extra £60 billion in giving GPs better access to scans.

Lung cancer has one of the survival rates and only 10.7 per cent of men and 14.1 per cent of women are alive five years after diagnosis.

This has slightly improved compared to 2012 when they were 9.7 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively.
