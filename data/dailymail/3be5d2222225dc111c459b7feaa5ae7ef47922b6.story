A Vermont school district that barred a parent from meetings because some staff members were afraid of him has agreed to pay $147,500.

Attorneys negotiated the settlement between the Addison Rutland Supervisory Union and Marcel Cyr after a federal judge ruled Cyr had been discriminated against. 

Cyr had been critical of the education provided his child at the Benson Village School.

'We're talking about a guy who was worried about his kid's education and was trying to bring attention to what he thought the problems were and he was told he couldn't come to the meetings,' said Allen Gilbert of the Vermont Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. 

Banned: A Vermont school district that barred parent Marcel Cyr from meetings about Benson Village School because some staff members were afraid of him has agreed to pay $147,500.

'Basic rights were taken away. Schools need really good reasons to serve no-trespass orders. This case is a win for everyone who cares for education, democracy and how public policy is done.'

No-trespass orders were served against Cyr in September 2011 and March 2012 after school officials said they feared for their safety, in part because of Cyr's loud voice and sometimes harsh comments about the education his son was receiving.

Cyr's family had lived in Benson, but they have since moved elsewhere.

Superintendent Ron Ryan tells the Rutland Herald  that he would rather lose a lawsuit than risk the safety of teachers, school staff, students and parents.

'From this point forward, I guess if we suspect someone is being unruly, we'll hire a law enforcement officer to stand guard,' he said. 

'It could be expensive, but that's what we have to do.

VTDigger.org reports that court records reveal Cyr has no criminal record and his lawyer Dan Barrett said that Cyr is 'not a threat to anyone.'

“In this case I think it’s laughable. If you were to ever meet Marcel, he’s no threat. He’s not going to harm anybody. … In this instance, I don’t see any real threat of harm from disclosure of the person,' said Barrett.

'It’s really important for government agencies in Vermont to understand that criticism is normal and healthy,' Barrett said. 

'Someone comes to a government meeting and criticizes a school board in public comments: he can’t be frozen out. That’s just part of democracy, and something that school boards and select boards sometimes don’t understand.”

According to court documents Cyr makes a living as a facilities manager at a retirement community.
