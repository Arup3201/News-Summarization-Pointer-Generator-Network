Reading have sacked manager Nigel Adkins after 20 months in charge of the Championship club.

The former Southampton boss, 49, was appointed in March 2013, but Saturday's 6-1 loss against Birmingham was his last in charge of the Berkshire club.

Reading are 16th in the Championship and 10 points from a play-off place. 

Steve Clarke, former West Brom manager and assistant manager at Liverpool and Chelsea, is favourite to succeed Adkins.

Nigel Adkins has been relieved of his duties as Reading manager with immediate effect

'Following this weekend's 6-1 defeat at Birmingham, the board feel that a change in manager is necessary,' read a club statement.

Assistant manager Andy Crosby and coach Dean Wilkins have also left the club.

Adkins took charge of Reading two months after being sacked by Southampton, having led the Saints from League One to the Premier League in successive seasons, but was unable to prevent Reading from being relegated from the top flight.

They finished seventh in the Championship last season and were only denied a play-off place by Leonardo Ulloa's late winner for Brighton at Nottingham Forest.
