A historically black women’s college in Atlanta has pulled the plug on its collegiate athletics programme in order to channel the funding towards a campus-wide health and fitness initiative.

Spelman College is a liberal arts college that counts prolific African Americans such as Pulitzer prize winning author Alice Walker, Bill Cosby’s daughter and his fictional daughter Rudy – actress, Keisha Knight Pulliam – among its alumni.

The announcement on Thursday comes in recognition of the overwhelming number of cases of Type 2 diabetes and obesity affecting one in two students while staggering statistics show four out of five African American in America women are obese.

Changing times: Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, said that it will redirect money that was dedicated to its intercollegiate sports programme - serving just 4 per cent of students - to all 2,100 on campus

The school said it would use the 
nearly $1 million that had been dedicated to its intercollegiate sports 
program, serving just 4 percent of students, for a campus-wide health 
and fitness program benefiting all 2,100.

‘When I was looking at the decision, 
it wasn't being driven by the cost as much as the benefit. With $1 
million, 80 student-athletes are benefiting,’ said Dr. Beverly Daniel 
Tatum, Spelman's president. ‘Or should we invest in a wellness program 
that would touch every student's life?’

Spelman's decision won't influence 
the Georgias and Ohio States of the world - where sports have become 
inextricable from the identity of the university. But it could attract 
notice at a broader band of colleges struggling with budget cuts and 
agonizing over whether the cost of college athletics is compatible with 
their missions.

For Tatum, there is also an element of social responsibility.

‘I have been to funerals of young 
alums who were not taking care of themselves, and I believe we can 
change that pattern not only for them but for the broader community,’ 
Tatum said.

The Division III school has been part
of the Great South Athletic Conference in seven sports, including 
basketball, softball and tennis.

Tatum said the school was sending a 
letter to the NCAA saying the school would be withdrawing from the 
conference and would no longer have an athletics program. Instead, the 
school plans to expand wellness programs and renovate fitness 
facilities.

David Ridpath, an associate professor
of sports administration at Ohio University, called the announcement 
eye-catching and predicted it could serve as a model at similar schools.

'With $1million, 80 student-athletes are benefiting. Or should we invest in a wellness programme that would touch every student's life?'

‘I don't really look at this as a 
complete anomaly," said Ridpath, who is also president-elect of the 
Drake Group, a national faculty organization advocating for changes in 
college athletics.

‘I think there might be other schools
that try to get out of the rat race and get back to the original view 
of we need to worry about the mind and body of our students.’

Spelman is unusually well-suited for 
such a move as it will likely face little uproar from alumni. Tatum 
acknowledged that Spelman's student-athletes were disappointed when they
were told last spring, but said she was hopeful it would not discourage
them or future students.

‘They are passionate about what they 
do and want to keep doing it,’ Tatum said. ‘Students who really want to 
be at Spelman will still come to Spelman. Athletics has been important 
to those students who have participated but to the overall campus 
community it has not been a major emphasis.’

The cost of athletics can be 
particularly painful at HBCUs, which have struggled to maintain 
enrollment in recent years, due to the weak economy and tighter credit 
requirements that have made it harder for some of their often low-income
students to get loans to pay for college.

College choice: Spelman's decision could attract notice at a broad band of colleges struggling with budget cuts and agonising over whether the cost of college athletics is compatible with their missions

Earlier this month, all-male 
Morehouse College - Spelman's sibling institution in Atlanta - announced
it would furlough faculty and make other budget cuts due to 
lower-than-expected enrollment.

The economics of college athletics 
vary widely from big-time programs to Division III schools where 
intercollegiate athletics are little more than another extracurricular 
activity.

At most places, they lose money for 
the college and typically, schools say that's fine. They argue there's 
educational value in athletics, and they run all sorts of programs to 
benefit students that aren't expected to pay for themselves, from jazz 
bands to the English department. It's part of the college experience.

But athletics are a part of the 
experience for only the tiny percentage of students who participate 
directly. According to the NCAA, there are about 400,000 
student-athletes nationwide, but there are 18.6 million undergraduates.

The median Division 1 athletic 
program, including those without football, is losing about $10 million 
annually, according to NCAA figures.

At programs like Spelman, the losses 
are less severe but expenses are rising rapidly. For Division III 
schools with football programs, expenses from athletics have nearly 
doubled since 2004 to $2.9 million for the median school. At schools 
without football, such as Spelman, costs have more than doubled to about
$1.4 million annually.

At Spelman, the wellness initiative 
includes spending money to help renovate the school's Read Hall, which 
was built in the 1950s, to make it a state-of-the-art fitness facility, 
with expanded hours and programs.

‘We are trying to meet students where 
they are in terms of their interest, but also helping them understand 
that the elements of wellness ... are the kinds of things that are going
to help them avoid the kinds of illnesses that are killing 
African-American women far too early,’ Tatum said.

Big price: The cost of athletics can be particularly painful at historically black colleges and universities, which have struggled to maintain enrolment in recent years
