'Unwind': Michael Brutsch says he posted sick comments on Reddit to help him relax after work

The man dubbed the biggest troll on the Internet has claimed he only posted vile comments because he wanted to ‘to unwind from my job’.

Michael Brutsch said that writing offensive messages and encouraging users to do the same helped him deal with the stress of working as a computer programmer.

He also claimed that he got the ‘biggest thrill’ from setting up web forums with sinister names like ‘Chokeabitch’ and ‘Jailbait’, which included sexual images of children.

Brutsch was speaking in his first TV interview since being exposed as the man behind the troll name ‘Violentacrez’ which he used for two years to spread filth on aggregating website Reddit.

The 49-year-old, who lives in Arlington, Texas, has been told not to come back to work but has wife Dani is apparently standing by him, as are their two children.

His employers were sickened at how he encouraged other users to post ‘Creepshots’ online, which were sexual pictures of women and girls taken without their knowledge.

Speaking to CNN, Brutsch said: ‘Violentacrez is what I did in my spare time to unwind from my 10-hour-a-day job.

‘That's how I relaxed in the evening. I no longer need to relax, because I no longer have a job.’

He also half-apologised but still claimed he was merely playing to the crowd by naming his Reddit forums things like ‘Rapebait’ and ‘misogyny’.

Brutsch said: ‘With the rape and incest Reddits, I have come around over the last few months to understand that some of these things can be harmful to some people.

‘I am to some degree apologising for what I did. Again, I was playing to an audience of college kids.’

Brutsch was first exposed by Gawker, which claimed that Reddit not only condoned his vile posts but encouraged and facilitated them, aware that the controversy would drive more traffic to the website.

He was supposedly close to the staff there and was even given a 'pimp hat' as a thank you for his contributions to Reddit, which now receives more than three billion hits a month.

Brutsch told CNN: ‘For those first two years, I had been tasked [by] Reddit admins with making certain that there was no overt or real child porn: no naked children, no naked teenagers, no children in swimsuits.

‘Honestly, the biggest thrill I got was those meaningless Internet points’.

The Creepshots forum sparked an online campaign to have it taken down.

It featured images of ordinary women on the street, in the gym or even at school who are caught unawares by stealthy 'creeps' with cameras.

Most shots focus on the buttocks or breasts of non-consenting women going about their daily lives - and users admit that 'at least 40 per cent' of the images are of underage girls.

In one alarming thread, a prolific poster appears to be a teacher, posting images of his unsuspecting female students.

The user, 'Weagleweaglewde', while posting numerous 'upskirt' images of girls in a classroom setting, claims in at least two posts that he is a teacher at a high school.

Another user posted advice which read: ‘Don't be nervous. If you are, you'll stand out.

‘Don't hover too much, get your shot and move on if you can. You'll look less like a creep if you have photos of things other than just hot chicks' a**es.'
