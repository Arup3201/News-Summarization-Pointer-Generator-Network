Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice has married the woman he is accused of attacking one day after he was indicted for aggravated assault.

Rice and his fianc√©e Janay Palmer were married on Friday, just a few weeks after security camera footage showed him dragging her body from an elevator in an Atlantic City casino.

The day before their wedding Rice was indicted on third-degree aggravated assault for allegedly knocking Palmer unconscious.

Bride and groom: Ray Rice and Janay Palmer with their daughter. The couple married Friday

The couple had been planning the 
wedding for a couple of weeks, according to TMZ, but news of the 
ceremony drew criticism from fellow American footballers.

Buffalo Bills linebacker Brandon 
Spikes claimed on Twitter the wedding was an attempt by Rice 'to save his image'.

The
 27-year-old had been arrested over allegations of domestic violence on 
February 15, after an incident at the Revel Casino and Hotel in New 
Jersey.

If found guilty he could be sentenced to three to five years in prison.

However,
 the complaint against him has been dropped and Rice's attorney, Michael
 Diamondstein, described footage of his client dragging Palmer as 
'authentic but incomplete'.

'We
 deny that he committed an aggravated assault. We don't think the law 
would support that [he did]. And we just ask the public to reserve 
judgment until all of the facts are out,' Diamondstein told ESPN.

He added that the couple, who have a young daughter together, were 'happy and in counseling'.

Backing: The Baltimore Ravens have defended Rice, seen here with Janay, and says he will remain on the team

Rice's
 team has also released a statement backing their player, which read: 
'We know there is more to Ray Rice than this one incident.'

Team
 owner Steve Bisciotti added that Rice, who in 2012 signed a five-year 
$35 million contract with the Ravens, will continue to have a future 
there.

The indictment, first reported by the Press of Atlantic City, came after the couple both declined medical treatment at the Revel but security video made the allegations hard to look past.

Diamondstein
 said last month he hoped that after an investigation, 'the matter turns
 out to be little more than a misunderstanding'.

Neither man was immediately able to be reached by Mail Online for comment.
