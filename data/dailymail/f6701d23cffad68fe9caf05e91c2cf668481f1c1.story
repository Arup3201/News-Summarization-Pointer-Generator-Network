The Granite City of Aberdeen has been identified as a stronghold for a deadly Italian crime syndicate, a new European Union report has found.

The Camorra group, based in Naples, is made up of family networks and is said to have killed more people than any other crime organisation in Europe.

But, according to the new study, the violent Mafia-style gang has spread further afield, and now 'controls' catering, food retail and property in Scotland's third most populous city.

The Transcrime research centre found evidence that Camorra and two other gangs, the 'Ndrangheta and the Sicilian Mafia, have operations in the UK.

The project, which was funded by the EU, analyses how the main organised criminal groups invested the proceeds of their crimes in selected countries between 2007 and 2013.

It states: 'The Camorra stronghold is Aberdeen, the third most populous city in Scotland, where it controls the catering, public works, food retail and wholesale and property sectors.'

The report adds: 'The Sicilian Mafia runs illegal gambling dens in London. The 'Ndrangheta also has a presence in London, in the property sector.'

Aberdeen has been linked repeatedly with Mafia activity over the past decade.

City restaurateur Antonio La Torre - named by Italian prosecutors as a Camorra crime lord - was arrested in 2005 and jailed in Italy for extortion and racketeering.

He is the brother of Augusto La Torre, who later confessed to murdering 40 people in Italy.

Former Aberdeen restaurateur Michele Siciliano, who is said to have looked after La Torre's finances following his extradition, also gave himself up to anti-Mafia prosecutors the following year.

Another city restaurant boss, Ciro Schiattarella, spent time in jail after being extradited to Italy to face charges.

Former Aberdeen City Council leader Barney Crockett said the Mafia's presence in Aberdeen was no secret.

He said: 'I think the attraction of Aberdeen is the fact that they can swap over a lot of money, because it is such a busy business environment.

'However, I am totally confident that there is no involvement in public works of any description.'

Members of Aberdeen's 600-strong Italian community have denied the city is in the grip of gangsters.

But Italian MEP Oreste Rossi is using the new report to push for fresh crime prevention 'tools' to combat Mafia money-laundering across Europe.

Last night, former MEP Struan Stevenson, said the claims in the report were 'absolutely staggering'.

He said: 'It is well known that criminal gangs in Scotland use legitimate business operations to turn their dirty money into clean money.

'But these have always been home-grown gangs, usually from Glasgow, where money has been known to go into things like taxi companies and construction firms.

'It is absolutely staggering - but probably shouldn't come as a surprise - that the Camorra has twigged that places like Aberdeen are potential havens for them to launder money.

'Scottish police need to get to the bottom of whether the findings of this report are true - and if it is, there needs to be unilateral action to stamp it out.

'New European laws to back this up would be helpful.'

The first seeds of the Cammora's deadly power took root in Aberdeen in the late 18th Century.

Italian commentators say its strength reached its peak in modern times.

The only record of alleged clan activity in the UK was perpetrated by the La Torres in Aberdeen.

The Transcrime report also identifies Mafia operations in Romania, Spain, Portugal and France in industries such as catering, property, transport and farming.

European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmstrom said the report was being analysed by Brussels officials and would influence new legislation being drawn up.

Police Scotland declined to comment on the report.
