Education Secretary Michael Gove has been accused of 'sitting on' warnings of a 'Trojan Horse' plots since 2010

Education Secretary Michael Gove was accused yesterday of ‘sitting on’ four-year-old warnings that Muslim hardliners were attempting to take over Birmingham schools.

Headteacher Tim Boyes said he cautioned the Department for Education (DfE) in 2010 about governors with a ‘disproportionate impact’ wanting to replace one sitting city head with a Muslim.

He had described a ‘bloodless coup’ at one Birmingham school and ‘an alliance to destabilise the head’ at another – three years before a letter alleging a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot was sent to the council.

Mr Boyes also highlighted ‘aggressive’, ‘intimidating’ and ‘highly organised’ governors that a primary headteacher believed were from a ‘co-ordinated group’ trying to exercise control over a school’s collective worship policy and other issues.

The Department for Education has insisted that its meeting with Mr Boyes – head of Queensbridge School, Birmingham, was a ‘general policy discussion’.

But Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, Tristram Hunt, said Mr Gove was complacent and had failed to listen to warnings.

Allegations emerged in early March about a so-called ‘Operation Trojan Horse’ plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of Birmingham schools.

Ofsted has since launched inspections of 21 schools while Birmingham City Council and the government are also carrying out their own separate investigations.

The DfE has appointed Peter Clarke, the former national head of counter-terrorism, to probe the alleged ‘Trojan Horse’ plot.

Mr Boyes, whose school is not being inspected by Ofsted, told BBC News he gave the department a presentation about the threat in 2010.

He said: ‘Back in 2010, I had a whole series of colleagues, other headteachers, who were reporting concerns about governance and things that weren’t going well in their schools.

‘Over 20 years…tensions and politics have exploded and as a result headteachers have had nervous breakdowns, they’ve lost their jobs, schools have been really torn apart.’

Slides from the presentation describe ‘staff and governors in an alliance to destabilise the head’ at one secondary school.

The Park View School in Birmingham - which, according to whistleblowers, has been infiltrated by Islamic extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people

‘(A) member of staff (was) suspended, having tried to prove the head to be fraudulent.’

At another school it was claimed there was a plot to remove the head teacher, Mr Boyes said.

The slide said: ‘Two governors with disproportionate impact... want to remove the head to have a Muslim head... (they are) working to undermine him. A known explicit intention the head lives with.’

At a primary school, a dramatic increase in interest in joining the governing body was described. Previously, it had been ‘hard to recruit a single parent’.

‘At the start of a new year four vacancies generate 13 nominations,’ Mr Boyes said.

‘The HT [headteacher] believed four to be from a specific co-ordinated group. Three were elected and the fourth came on as an LA (local authority) governor. This group were highly organised/nationally networked.

'Michael Gove refused to listen to the warnings about radical hardliners'

‘The focal point was collective worship and a parent/public meeting was called. This was aggressive, intimidating... issues spread to swimming, other curriculum areas, meals, uniform.’  

Mr Boyes, one of about 800 national leaders of education, told BBC News he was not surprised the DfE did not act on his concerns.

‘What I think the solutions might be are in the absolute opposite direction to government policy,’ he said.

‘Because of the academy programme encouraging schools to opt out of local authority control, you’ve got increasing numbers of schools acting individually, on their own.

‘We have schools that have now become increasingly isolated and segregated.’

A DfE spokesman said: ‘Our records show this was a general policy discussion. There is absolutely no place for extremism in schools and this Government has taken a number of significant steps to combat it.

‘This meeting took place at the same time as the Department was enhancing our due diligence and counter-extremism capability to make schools more aware of risks and to protect children.’

But Tristram Hunt insisted the Government should have acted on the allegations.

He said: ‘Michael Gove refused to listen to the warnings about radical hardliners taking control of schools. His department has sat on these warnings for four years

‘This is gross negligence on the part of ministers. Michael Gove’s complacency has given rise to a constant stream of failings in our school system.’
