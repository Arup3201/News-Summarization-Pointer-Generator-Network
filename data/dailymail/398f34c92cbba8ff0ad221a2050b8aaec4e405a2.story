Thomas Muller is an old fashioned footballer. 

When Muller celebrates, he celebrates like a player from an old black and white VHS. There is no badge kissing, no sliding, no cupping of the ear. He simply throws two arms in the air. When the goal is a special one, he sinks to his knees.

On every occasion, there is nothing readable in his face besides joy. No self-adulation, no arrogance, simply the pure joy of having found the back of the net.

Invaluable: Muller is happy to play in any attacking position so long as he is scoring goals

As a footballer, his game is not about speed, it is not about power, and it is not even about rigourously trained technical ability. 

It is immensely difficult to characterise his strongest attributes, because he is not a modern athlete. He is a bundle of limbs, masquerading as a professional footballer of the 21st century. 

But Thomas Muller masquerades very well indeed. For Germany and for Bayern Munich, Muller’s versatility is invaluable. He is happy in any position, so long as he is attacking, and believes that 'everything depends on whether you have the right ambition for the position you are in'.

It is that which makes him so unpredictable for opponents. He is an efficient creator of space, an efficient passer of the ball, and an efficient goalscorer.

At the last World Cup in South Africa, he was a ruthlessly efficient goalscorer. Only 20 years old and only one year of regular Bundesliga football to his name, Muller scored five World Cup goals – two of them against England – and claimed the Golden Boot. It is a prize which he intends to defend in Brazil. 

Not that the trophy itself is particularly important to him. In a recent interview with the Tagesspiegel, he declared that 'if you gave me half a candle for scoring the most goals at a World Cup, I would treasure that as much as the Golden Boot'.

That is Muller in a nutshell. Not for him, the personal museum or the statue in his image. He wishes to win everything, but it is the winning that counts, not the medals. 

In Germany, he is seen as a classic Bavarian farmer boy. Married at the age of 19, and entirely at home in a pair of Lederhosen. So Bavarian is he indeed, that a columnist for the Munich paper TZ described him as a 'cultural export'. 

On the back of Manchester United’s interest in Muller, the same columnist wrote: 'you can have him, England, but only if we get Prince William and Kate'. 

'You can keep the nutters from UKIP', he added.

How loyal to Bavaria Muller he really is, is yet to be seen. In recent months, he has voiced his love and commitment to Bayern, but also his displeasure at his less central role under Pep Guardiola. 

For as much as Muller is grounded and almost old fashioned, it is ambition which drives him on more than anything. You may not find him modelling underwear (though he does do adverts for milk in Germany), but he is always after the next bit of success. 

'When I was a kid, I tried a lot of sports', he says, 'but when I wasn’t very good at something, I let it go. I need something where I can set myself goals'. 

Muller, the Bavarian farm boy, knows his own limits. He will always love his home, he will always love Bayern. But as a footballer, he always needs the next challenge. For now, it is to defend his Golden Boot in Brazil.
