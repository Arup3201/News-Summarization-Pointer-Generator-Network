Holding an umbrella, plus your bag and anything else you need when out and about in the rain can make enjoying a coffee on the go rather tricky.

But that's all about to change because a gadget has been invented to stop rain-lashed commuters being forced to awkwardly juggle a brolly with their morning coffee.

And it's so good, you'll wonder why you didn't think of it yourself!

Now you can stay dry and still hold a cuppa while out and about in the rain

A nifty new invention means you can easily hold your umbrella without struggle to enjoy a coffee on the go

The device is a cup holder which clips on to the centre pole of an umbrella and enables a user to carry their drinks with ease.

The contraption is able to pivot, which means your beverage will stay upright whether your brolly is furled or open.

The nifty new invention, called the Morella, enables people to have a spare hand which they can use to carry a bag, check their phone or change a track on their mp3 player.

It can be removed and attached within minutes by twisting the nut on the side and will fit a variety of different sized umbrellas.

It comes in two models - one for single cups, and another that can hold two drinks.

The Morella lets you hold a single cup of your favourite drink or you can help a mate and hold two

The product was invented by friends Andrew Tan, 35, Ross Malcolm, 36, and Jordan Schlipf, 30.

Andrew, from West London, said: 'My friend Ross was outside a pub in when it started to rain, so he had his drink in one hand and an umbrella in the other.

'He then realised there could be a product that would make them easier to hold and got in touch with me and another friend, Jordan.

You don't have to be on the move. Use your umbrella as a handy cup holder when you're chatting with friends

'Initially I laughed and then I realised that it could actually be something really useful and that it just might work.

'We made a few prototypes out of cardboard and then approached some designers and got it patented.

'The Morella comes in two different styles, a single cup holder and a double cup holder.

'Someone can easily attach one to an umbrella by unscrewing the nut, putting it around the pole, and then screwing it back on.

'The holder can move so that no matter how the umbrella is held, the drinks will always stay upright because the centre of gravity is below the pivot.

'It makes it easier to carry an umbrella and a drink and frees up a hand to hold a bag, get something out of a pocket, use a mobile phone or change the song on an mp3 player.

'It’s perfect for commuters who might be carrying a lot of things or for festival-goers who are trying to fetch a couple of drinks in the rain.'

The Morella has been launched on Kickstarter where Andrew, Ross, and Jordan hope to raise £35,000 for the manufacturing process.

The expected retail price for the single-cup device is between £5 and £10, and between £8 and £12 for the double.

With the Morella you have a free hand to send emails, texts and make calls in the rain
