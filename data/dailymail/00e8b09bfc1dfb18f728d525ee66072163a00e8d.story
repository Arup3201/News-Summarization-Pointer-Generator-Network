Robin Van Persie has given Louis Van Gaal cause for concern after going off with a grimace at half-time of Netherlands’ friendly with Wales in Amsterdam.

Early suggestions were that the Manchester United striker had picked up a slight groin injury but whatever the extent it is a worry for the Dutch manager so close to the World Cup starting.

Van Gaal spoke before this game about Van Persie’s fitness and stated he was ‘not 100 per cent’ after missing six weeks towards the end of last season through a knee injury.

Decisive: Arjen Robben scored one and made one for Holland in their win against Wales

Number one: Robben celebrates after giving Holland a first-half lead against Wales in Amsterdam

Positive: Lens showed that Holland do have some strength in reserve with a cool finish against Wales

Team player: Robben then takes the plaudits after setting up a goal for substitute Jeremain Lens

Any further troubles will throw Van Gaal’s plans for Holland’s opening group game against Spain on June 13 into doubt.

Referee: Bulent Yildirim 7

MOTM: Robben

Van
 Persie’s importance to his country was illustrated by the way their 
attack became blunted in the second half, although his replacement 
Jeremain Lens did score a tap-in with 14 minutes to go to make the final
 score 2-0.

Arjen Robben had scored the opener in the first half by converting a rebound from a Van Persie shot.

Wales
 manager Chris Coleman will be warmed by the way his team, without 
Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Ashley Williams, tested the hosts at times
 and could have given their travelling something to cheer had a couple 
of openings been finished more accurately.

Much
 was made in the build-up to this game of Van Gaal’s decision to switch 
to a 5-3-2 system from Holland’s usual 4-3-3. He trialled it in their 
previous friendly against Ghana last Saturday prompting Bert van 
Marwijk, the man who led his nation to the World Cup final four years 
ago, to question the wisdom of changing tactics so close to the 
tournament starting.

There 
might be more sniping to come given Van Gaal sprung a surprise by opting
 for a 4-4-2 diamond formation here. More strings to the Oranje bow or 
too much tinkering?

Wesley 
Sneijder operated at the front of a midfield four behind Van Persie and 
Robben and with that trio on song, as was the case from kick-off, their 
positioning shouldn’t matter.

Say cheese: Louis van Gaal is grabbed for a selfie with a Holland fan before the game

Time's up: Holland captain Robin van Persie was taken off at half-time

Assist: Van Persie's first-half shot was parried into the path of Robben who opened the scoring

Impact: Jeremain Lens replaced Van Persie at half-time and scored Holland's second goal

Within
 two minutes Daryl Janmaat dispossessed Neil Taylor and fed Robben who 
lashed over, then 60 seconds later Van Persie fashioned space and forced
 Wayne Hennessey into a good save.

In
 the ninth minute Robben fooled debutant James Chester with a run in 
behind to break the offside trap and when Stefan de Vrij’s lofted ball 
found him a goal looked certain. But the Bayern Munich player dragged 
his shot wide.

It was 
whirlwind stuff yet this Welsh side, even shorn of its stars, can play a
 bit and gradually the visitors found a foothold in the game.

Joe
 Allen, captaining his country for the first time, was breaking forward 
with the ball and executing sharp passes. Jonny Williams began finding 
joy on the right hand side.   

Then
 in the 20th minute Taylor released striker Simon Church down the left 
flank and his cross would have led to a tap-in for Andy King had Bruno 
Martins Indi not stretched to nick clear. It was a spell that will 
encourage Coleman for forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers.

Van
 Gaal’s team came again though. Robben played a one-two with Sneijder 
then jinked past Danny Gabbidon only to continue tip-toeing too long so 
when he fired his shot Chester was able to clear off the line.

In
 the 32nd minute he did not wait to pull the trigger. Van Persie beat 
Chris Gunter on the left and cracked a shot that Hennessey could only 
divert into the path of Robben who struck instantly.

Van
 Persie could have made it two soon after but he sliced his effort just 
wide after being teed up by Daley Blind. It was to be the last act in 
his game, replaced at half-time by Lens with cameras picking up a wince 
that will make Dutch fans do just the same.

The
 Dynamo Kiev forward did add gloss to Holland’s win by slotting in at 
the far post after a perfect cross from Robben, released by Sneijder, 
but it is clear any absence of Van Persie will cast a huge shadow.

Bum note: Wales player Hal Robson-Kanu changes his shorts at pitchside during the game

Support: Kevin Strootman, who will miss the World Cup through injury, was in the crowd to cheer Holland on

Have a word: Van Gaal talks to his assistant Patrick Kluivert ahead of kick-off

Stellar: Holland named a strong side including Robben, Van Persie, Sneijder and De Jong

Man of the people: Star man Robben gives the match ball to a Dutch fan at the end of the game

Orange: Dutch fans turned out in support of Van Gaal's team before they depart for Brazil
