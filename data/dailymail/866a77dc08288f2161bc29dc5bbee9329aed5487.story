Dead in custody: Ram Singh was on trial for murder, gang-rape, and destruction of evidence, among other charges

The death of Ram Singh, the main accused in the brutal December 16 Vasant Vihar gang-rape case, has turned a spotlight on lapses by Tihar Jail officials, and the number of 'unnatural' deaths at the high-security prison over the past 10 years.

Singh's death, which is alleged to have come at his own hand, highlighted the number of suicides at the jail.

According to a report by the Department of Psychiatry, Central Jail Hospital, Tihar, around 20 prisoners committed suicide in Tihar Jail over the last decade.Â 

All were pre-trial verdict inmates, 
like 35-year-old Ram Singh, who became the twenty-first inmate to have 
died an unnatural death. In 2012, two inmates committed suicide in the 
prison.

Singh, who was
lodged inside a high security cell of Jail No. 3 and had been on 
suicide watch, was found hanging in his cell early on Monday. At least 
one guard from the Tamil Nadu Police was stationed round the clock 
outside his cell. But, around 5.45am, other inmates found his lifeless 
body hanging from the ceiling and informed the jail authorities.

As questions were immediately raised 
over the death, and with the post mortem report yet to come, Tihar Jail 
officials were unofficially sticking to the theory that Singh had 
committed suicide even as senior officials including Vimla Mehra, 
director general of Tihar, declined to comment on record about the cause
of death.

As the death took place under suspicious circumstances, the Delhi government has ordered an enquiry by a metropolitan magistrate.

A report by Tihar Jail's own hospital cites that the actual number of suicides at the prison may be higher than official figures suggest. Such deaths are under-reported in a jail that houses almost 12,000 inmates.

The report from psychiatrists Dr Anju Gupta and Dr N K Girdhar of Central Jail Hospital says: "Probably suicide rate has increased over last year. The method of committing suicide was hanging in all cases except one by strangulation. All were under-trial detainees and no one was sentenced. Reason might be ongoing stress related to court proceedings and anticipation of unfavorable outcome of trial."

The study revealed that more than half of all inmates who commit suicide in prison are between 25 and 34 years old.

B.K. Gupta, a former Police Commissioner & director general (Prisons), said: "You cannot stop suicides from taking place in prisons, including Tihar. There are four to five cases reported every year in Tihar.

"We have to wait for the post-mortem report and the judicial inquiry report before arriving at any early conclusion. But interesting would be to find out if the CCTV was working in the cell where Ram Singh was kept. He was in a high-risk ward with two more inmates and in such cells CCTVs work 24/7."

The defendant's family members, however, dismissed the suicide theory and were quick to claim Singh had been murdered and his body hanged from the ceiling of his cell by his murderer.

Singh's father Mange Ram told Mail Today: "I had met my son three days ago and he was fine at that time, he did not show any signs of depression. I am sure that somebody murdered him and hanged his body from the ceiling. He had told me many times that he is beaten up regularly inside the jail. The jail inmates and other staff also used to sexually exploit my son. After he told me this, I had asked his lawyer to request the jail authorities to change his cell."

V.K. Anand, Ram Singh's lawyer, repeated claims that his client had been sexually assaulted in jail

Singh's lawyer V.K. Anand seconded the claim of sexual assault.

The response from Tihar jail officials was typically sterile. An official statement said: "Under-trial prisoner Ram Singh, who was lodged in Jail No. 3, was found hanging at around 5.45am. The family members of the deceased were informed about the incident. The matter is being inquired into by judicial officer as per section 176 CrPC. The exact cause of death would be known after receipt of inquiry officer report which includes post mortem report and forensic examination."

Prone to violent behaviour and frequent mood swings, Singh was kept under suicide watch. He had allegedly shown suicidal tendencies and was said to remain aloof inside the prison.

According to sources inside Tihar Jail, there were three other inmates in the cell where he was kept but all of them were asleep when Singh died.

Jail sources said that Ram Singh and his cell-mates had their dinner and slept at 10pm on Sunday night.

"A guard had last checked his cell at around 2am and by then everything was all right. It is quite possible that he might have committed suicide at a time between 3.30am to 5.45am, when everybody is fast asleep in the jail," said a jail insider.

Singh, who was to be produced before court for its daily hearing, was rushed to the jail hospital where he was declared brought-in dead. His body has been preserved in the mortuary of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Trauma Centre. A post mortem will be conducted early on Tuesday.

What remains in question is why the other three prisoners couldn't hear any noise when Singh was allegedly trying to kill himself.

Another question that casts doubt on the suicide theory is that Ram Singh had only partial use of his right arm, and it is not possible for such a person to hang himself using one arm.

"Let the 
autopsy report come. The reasons behind the incident will only be known 
after submission of the inquiry report," said Delhi's Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit.

Union Home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said security at Tihar Jail would be reviewed

Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said on Monday that the preliminary inquiry into the death of Ram Singh, the main defendant in the Delhi gang-rape case, suggests he committed suicide in Tihar Jail.

Describing the incident as a major security lapse, he said the security on the Tihar Jail premises will be reviewed.

"There is a major security lapse. Preliminary inquiry suggests he committed suicide. The incident is being inquired into by a magistrate. Let us wait for the report," Shinde said.

Addressing the allegations that Singh was murdered, he said that is exactly what the magistrate will probe. Sources said forensic experts and a team of Delhi Police have reached Tihar Jail to gather evidence in the case.

Singh's death has raised questions over the lack of electronic surveillance inside the prison.

Asked whether the home ministry will take steps to increase electronic surveillance on the jail premises, Shinde said prisons do not come under his ministry.

Earlier in the day, Vimla Mehra, DG (prisons) met Shinde and briefed him about the sequence of events leading to the death of the inmate.

Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who was scheduled to meet Shinde for a routine meeting, also discussed the incident with him.

Every year at least two inmates commit suicide in Tihar jail. According to a report of the department of psychiatry, Central Jail Hospital, Tihar, around 20 prisoners have killed themselves in the last 10 years. All were undergoing trial like Ram Singh, who allegedly committed suicide inside his high-security cell on Monday.

In 2012, two inmates committed suicide, while 20 prisoners died of other causes.

The report from the Tihar Jail hospital states: "Depression and hopelessness seem to be the two most common psychological factors driving inmates to death. Hopelessness and suicide have a stronger correlation than depression and suicide.

"A period of risk for pre-trial inmates is near the time of a court appearance, especially when a guilty verdict and harsh sentencing may be anticipated. A great deal of all jail suicides occurred within three days of a court appearance."

With various theories being bandied around over the death of Ram Singh, Tihar Jail authorities claim he was not suffering from any mental disorder.

"He seemed fine. There were no suicidal symptoms seen in him. Moreover, we have proper security in the jail. All the inmates are counselled timely, we cannot say why Singh did this," said Sunil Gupta, Tihar jail's PRO.

Experts often blame suicides on upbringing, childhood neglect, improper parenting and uncontrolled anger.

"These problems don't arise all of a sudden and manifest during childhood. Due to poor guidance and support they tend to engage in petty crimes like stealing. Gradually if the problems are not identified and corrected, these develop into antisocial personality and problems related to drug and alcohol abuse," said Dr Sameer Malhotra of Max hospital.
