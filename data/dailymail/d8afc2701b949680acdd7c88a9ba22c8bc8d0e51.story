There are few more relaxing things in life than putting your feet up and enjoying a quiet cup of tea in the sunshine.

But when two sisters decided to enjoy a brew together while on holiday, it turned out to be a far from relaxing experience.

Despite holidaying at the Happy Valley caravan site things quickly turned nasty between the siblings.

Scarred: Patricia Morris, 68, and her sister Christine Doyle started arguing over tea. It resulted in Morris smashing a China tea-cup into her younger sister's face. These are the horrific injuries which she suffered

Patricia Morris, 68, and her sister Christine Doyle
began to have a 'petty sibling argument' while enjoying their tea - 
only for grandmother Morris to smash a china teacup into Mrs Doyle's 
face.

It has left the 66-year-old scarred for life - but at Cardiff Crown Court today she begged a judge not to jail her sister.

Speaking after the case, the tearful mother-of-one said: 'She brought that cup down so hard on my face that my cheek flapped open.

'The police officers who interviewed me said it looked like a knife wound.

'Blood spurted out everywhere, I was horrified. I was in such shock. She never said sorry, she just stared.'

Retired factory worker Christine said it was the first time they'd had a fall out and had always been 'close'.

Scene of crime: The Happy Valley campsite in Porthcawl, South Wales, is pictured

Falling out: The sisters were on holiday in adjacent caravans at the campsite

She said: 'We shared a room at home until Patricia got married - I was a bridesmaid at her wedding.

'Now I am glad to see her punished but could never see my sister go to jail.

'That day she just lost it. I didn't recognise her.

'She still hasn't apologised even though my statement saved her from jail.'

The storm in a teacup flared when the pair, who have neighbouring holiday homes at the site  in Porthcawl, South Wales, decided to have a drink in the sunshine.

As the argument started, white-haired Morris threw her tea over Mrs Doyle who responded by throwing her tea over her older sister.

But the tea party bust-up turned 
violent when Morris rammed the cup into her sister's face - causing a 
wound that needed 35 stitches.

The falling out took place during the holiday last summer.

Prosecutor John Probert told Cardiff Crown Court: 'They were regular visitors to the site and until that point they had got on perfectly well all their lives.

'But
the sisters began arguing after Mrs Morris said she was going to take 
her disabled husband for a shower in the ladies washrooms.

'Mrs Doyle thought that was inappropriate and an argument started.

'Mrs Morris threw her tea over her sister who reciprocated.

'Mrs Morris then came towards her sister and brought her teacup down onto her forehead.'

The court heard the blow caused two small wounds to her eyebrow and jaw and a huge gash down her left cheek.

Mrs Doyle was taken to hospital and transferred to a specialist plastic surgery unit where she had 35 stitches inserted in her face.

Judge Stephen Hopkins said: 'It is somewhat ironic that this happened at the Happy Valley caravan site.'

The judge said Mrs Doyle's plea had saved her sister from an 'inevitable prison sentence'. He told Morris: 'You don't deserve a sister as generous in spirit as yours.'

Morris, of Blackwood, South Wales, was given a 12-month suspended sentence afteradmitting wounding.

Joanna James, defending, said: 'It was a momentary act of sheer stupidity after what was a petty sibling argument. It is a tragic case'.
