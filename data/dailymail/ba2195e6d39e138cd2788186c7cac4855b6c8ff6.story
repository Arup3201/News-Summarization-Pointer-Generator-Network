Northampton prop Silesi Ma'afu has been handed a one-week ban and order to pay £500 costs after punching Leicester hooker Tom Youngs in Friday's Aviva Premiership semi-final.

The pair were involved in a punch-up 
during a heated encounter which saw Ma'afu sent off for his attack on Youngs, who was sin binned for his involvement.

Youngs later posted a picture of the duo's punch-up along with the tweet: 'Good shot mate, go well in the final #rocky.'

The ban means Ma'afu will miss the Amlin Challenge Cup final against Bath on Friday but will be eligible for the Premiership final against Saracens on May 31.

Meanwhile, Leicester Tigers fly-half Owen Williams must wait to discover if he is to be punished for making contact with the eyes or eye area of Saints centre Luther Burrell in the same match, after his hearing was adjourned.

Both decisions were announced by Premiership Rugby on their official Twitter account.
