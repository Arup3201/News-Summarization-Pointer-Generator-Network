There have been lion and tiger cubs, baby gorillas, rhinos and giraffes, but for the first time in 40 years Longleat stately home and safari park in Wiltshire is expecting the arrival of a baby human.

Society beauty Emma McQuiston, AKA the Viscountess of Weymouth, is three months pregnant with her first baby on her first wedding anniversary. 

This will also be the first child for her husband Ceawlin Thynn, 40, the Viscount of Weymouth, son of the 7th Marquess of Bath and heir to the Longleat estate.

Emma revealed the exciting news in an exclusive interview in Hello! Magazine:

'I never thought I'd say I want a big tummy!' the aspiring TV presenter joked. 'But when the bump shows, it's like, "This is real".'

The 28-year-old, who is half Nigerian, believes the baby will bring the aristocratic family closer together in the aftermath if a rift amongst the family.

Ceawlin's father, the Marquess of Bath,  known for his Bohemian lifestyle and prolific sex life, snubbed the couple and refused to attend their wedding.

Reportedly, the father and son fell out over the removal of murals from 
the walls of the historic estate in Wiltshire.

At the time Lady Emma said of 
Lord Bath’s absence, ‘It’s very sad he didn’t come to the wedding and 
that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point, but what can I 
do?’

Now that the couple and the eccentric Lord have made amends, a baby will no doubt add to the family unity. 

The Viscountess, who likes to be known as plain Emma told Hello! that the couple had been trying for a baby since January and were overjoyed when a home pregnancy test revealed Emma was expecting back in March.

When Emma, 28, went for her first scan, the baby was under a centimetre long and 'looked like a frog!'. But the couple decided to keep their exciting news a secret until after their major scan at 12  weeks.

By the next scan, Emma could see a huge pair of lips, which she says were just like her own as a child, and a tiny fist which was clenching and unclenching on the screen.

The couple don't yet know the baby's sex, although Emma said she would be happy with either, but the little heir will be welcomed into the world in a room fit for a King.

Emma is planning to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's hospital, where Prince George was born last year. Princes William and Harry were also born there, as was Emma herself.

Down-to-earth Emma admitted in her interview that watching One Born Every Minute has given her a taste of what's to come -- and that she has every intention of using painkillers.

A new baby will be another exciting reason to visit Longleat, which has seen some additions since Emma's arrival including a children's ride and an exhibition of her wedding dress.

Emma's dress was put on display in May, along with a new portrait of the blushing bride painted by renowned artist Paul Benney.

The showcase includes portraits of her big day as well as diaries, photos, portraits and even newsreel footage of previous Thynn family weddings.

She's said of the exhibit, ‘It's a lovely reminder of the wedding and it is a great way to showcase all the amazing work and effort others put in to make it such a memorable and joyous occasion.

‘It’s also fascinating to be able to compare it to other weddings which have taken place here at Longleat over the centuries.’

And now with the next generation on its way, there may be plenty more weddings at Longleat to look forward to.
