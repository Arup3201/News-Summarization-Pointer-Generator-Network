They say that politics is showbusiness for ugly people.

But voters seem willing to give politicians the benefit of the doubt, casting some of Britain’s most popular leading men to play our political leaders.

In a new survey Hugh Grant is cast as David Cameron and Colin Firth is likened to Nick Clegg, although Ed Miliband is tipped to be played by Mr Bean star Rowan Atkinson.

A new survey shows how 27 per cent of people think Mr Bean star Rowan Atkinson should play Ed Miliband in a film, while David Cameron gets Love Actually star Hugh Grant

Tony Blair has been portrayed in films several times, most notably by Michael Sheen in three movies, including in the 2006 film The Queen.

But today’s crop of politicians have so far failed to catch Hollywood’s eye.

All that will change in the New Year when Nigel Farage will be portrayed in a Channel 4 drama about what would happen if Ukip won the 2015 general election.

Producers have not yet cast an actor to play the Ukip leader. According to a new ComRes survey for the Independent on Sunday, 13 per cent of people think Alan Rickman could play Mr Farage.

A further 21 per cent favoured Atkinson, but he is already cast to play Mr Miliband by 27 per cent of voters.

Mr Miliband has struggled to shake-off criticism that he does not look like a prime minister, with the same survey suggesting just 20 per cent saying they can imagine him as PM.

While the other party leaders each get paired with good looking actors, rubber-faced Atkinson is best known for playing the socially-awkward Mr Bean who struggles to communicate beyond incompressible noises.

Some 18 per cent of people thought Hugh Grant could play David Cameron.

Grant has form in the role of a prime minister called David, a part he played in the 2003 Richard Curtis film Love Actually.

And in a moment of art imitating life, Mr Cameron last year delivered a speech in Russia declaring: ‘Britain may be a small island, but I would challenge anyone to find a country with a prouder history, a bigger heart or greater resilience.’

Colin Firth, who withdrew his support for the Lib Dems over tuition fees, is tipped to play Nick Clegg

It echoed a scene in Love Actually in which Grant’s character told a press conference: 'We may be a small country, but we are a great one too.’

Grant was also tipped to play Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg by 17 per cent of voters, followed by 12 per cent who opted for Colin Firth.

Firth famously supported the Lib Dems before the 2010 election, but withdrew his backing later that year in protest at the hiking of tuition fees.

Earlier this month Mr Clegg’s wife Miriam set her sights even higher.

Asked on ITV’s Lorraine who would play her husband in a film, she joked: 'Is George Clooney on offer?'
