Prince William roared with laughter when he was inadvertently introduced as his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, before handing a philanthropic award to the wife of Bill Gates.

The Duke of Cambridge was mistakenly presented using Prince Philip's title during a ceremony at the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall, central London.

The embarrassing gaffe was made by the ceremony's toastmaster in front of former Prime Minister Sir John Major, Lord (Paddy) Ashdown and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.

Prince William handed Melinda Gates the Chatham House Prize in recognition of her humanitarian work over more than two decades helping women and children around the world.

She was chosen in recognition of her efforts helping to provide increased access to family planning, life-saving vaccines and better nutrition with the Gates Foundation.

'With her equally remarkable husband Bill, Melinda set up the Gates Foundation to change the world. 

'And change it she has, transforming the lives of women, the poor, the sick and the disadvantaged in Africa and elsewhere,' said Prince William.

'The Queen, who has been patron of Chatham House since 1952, sends you this message, which I have the honour of reading now: 'I send my warmest wishes and congratulations to Melinda Gates on being awarded this year's Chatham House Prize for her humanitarian work and her long-standing commitment to philanthropy. Members of the Royal Institute of International Affairs have chosen a worthy winner.''

Mrs Gates said she was honoured to receive the award but said it was crucial to take the discussion about development out of the realm of posturing and rumour. 

She said that while it was 'absolutely crucial' to talk about the Ebola epidemic in Africa, it was important not to write the continent off as 'hopeless'.

The philanthropist raised the point that with the right information and tools, impoverished people can 'lift themselves up, lift their families up, communities and nations'. 

'I sometimes wish we could take your public here and let them witness first hand what Bill and I have witnessed around the world,' said Mrs Gates.

'Since 1990 we have cut in half the number of children who have died under the age of five. At the same time the population has grown by two billion.

'That is incredible. We have a chance again in the next decade, in the next 15 years, to cut that number in half again.'
