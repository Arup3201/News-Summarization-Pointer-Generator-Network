The Duchess of Cambridge has expressed her grief over the death of a 12-year-old cancer patient she met on a visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital.

Catherine spent time with leukemia sufferer Fabian Bate, then aged nine, when she and William attended the opening of a new children's wing at the Surrey hospital in 2011.

Shortly after the visit, the Duchess, 32, penned a hand-signed letter to the young boy that spoke movingly of how she had been touched by his 'strength of character' and 'positive energy'.

Today his parents, Darrell and Lydia, have revealed how their son, who died at home in Hampton Court, Greater London, on Tuesday, drew strength from her words in the years since their meeting.

Mr Bate, 52, told the Daily Mirror: 'Just having the memory that the future King and Queen are rooting for you is pretty awesome to have in your armoury and for keeping your child going in the dark times.' 

In her note, written on St James’s Palace headed notepaper, Kate said: 'This must be a troubling time for you, your parents and your sisters, but I know I left the Royal Marsden assured by how incredibly talented, kind and clever the team at the hospital are.

'Combined with your belief and positive energy, you couldn’t be in better hands.' 

After being diagnosed in 2006 and undergoing three years of chemotherapy, Fabian went into remission in 2009. But the cancer returned in July 2011 and he had to undergo transplants with bone marrow donated by his sister, Cassia. 

Prince William and Kate made the visit to the Surrey hospital in October 2011, just six months after their wedding. 

Tribute: Mr Bate, pictured with Fabian, wife Lydia and daughters Cassia (left) and Oleander, said today that his son has been laid to rest with the 'very personal and special' letter he received from the Duchess

The Duke of Cambridge took over as president of the Royal Marsden following his mother’s death in 1997. 

In her letter, Kate expressed delight at the news that Fabian’s two older sisters Cassia, now 14, and Oleander, now 20, had been found to be a bone marrow match.

The Duchess added: 'I will keep my fingers crossed that your health goes from strength to strength over the months ahead.'

Speaking six months after he received the letter, Fabian recalled that it was 'kind' of the Duchess to send him the letter, but said that it made his Mum 'cry a bit'.

Sorrow: A spokesman for the royal couple said: 'The Duke and Duchess are sad to hear the news and their thoughts are with Fabian's family'. Above, Catherine with Fabian during the 2011 hospital visit

After the first letter, the royal couple sent two more letters to Fabian to let him and his family know that they were updated on his progress and treatment and that he was in their thoughts. 

A spokesman for the royal couple said yesterday: 'The Duke and Duchess are sad to hear the news and their thoughts are with Fabian's family.' 

Mr Bate said today that his son, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2006, has been laid to rest with the 'very personal and special' letter. 

'I want Kate to know that it wasn't just a letter, it was a message that meant so much. It has stayed with him and it is staying with him now that he is departed.'

He added that his son would often remember that William, 32, had told him to be brave during the visit. 

Speaking a year after the visit, Fabian, then 10, recalled with excitement the day he met the royal couple.

He told the Daily Mail: My sisters came to hospital that day because they were excited to see Kate and William. It was funny when William put his arm around Ollie: it made her blush.

'I asked Kate about the wedding — girls like talking about those things — and told her it made everyone very happy.

'She promised to look at my blog Faith4Fabian and one day when we were getting ready to go to Legoland the postman knocked with a letter from her. 

'She wrote that it was nice to meet me and she was keeping her fingers crossed. It was kind, but it made Mum cry a bit. 

Fabian, born in 2002, was first diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in June 2006 after his parents noticed that he had developed a small lump on his neck. 

Due to his initial poor response to the treatment, Fabian was categorised as being 'at high risk of relapse' - which means that he only carried a 60 per cent chance of being cured.

But the three years on treatment went better than expected and, apart from minor infections and a case of shingles, he coped very well having few hospital admissions. 

He remained in remission and in September 2009 he came off treatment. Posting on Fabian's blog, Faith4Fabian, his parents said they 'enjoyed a wonderful period without daily medication'.

By July 2011 he had become 'noticeable more lethargic and anaemic' - both typical symptoms of recurring disease - and suspicions were aroused during one of his frequent trips to hospital. 

A blood test confirmed that he had relapsed but revealed that it was isolated to the bone marrow. As the relapse was 36 months from his initial diagnosis, he was put in the immediate risk category.

That year Fabian met the Duke and Duchess when the royal couple, who had married just five months previously, attended the opening of a new children's wing at the Royal Marsden Hospital. 

Later that year it was confirmed that his sisters, Cassia, then 11, and Oleander, then 17, were perfect bone marrow matches for their brother. 

Due to a medical complication, Oleander could not donate her stem cells as planned and Cassia had to step in and take her place - with the transplant procedure taking place in 2012.

Over the course of his treatment, Fabian had several rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and two bone marrow transplants as well as trying new therapies. 

He had been due to visit Sheffield to start a biological therapy last month but could not travel because of fever.
