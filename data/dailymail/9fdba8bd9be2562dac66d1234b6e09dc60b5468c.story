Serial entrepreneur Elon Musk has invented a gesture-controlled 3D printing system for rocket parts inspired by the design process in the Iron Man film.

Mr Musk had teased his creation on Twitter in recent weeks but has now released a video demonstrating the technology, which combines custom-made computer software, a virtual reality headset and a cutting-edge printer.

The inventor, who recently unveiled his vision for a 'hyperloop' high-speed super tube, uses hand gestures and a Leap Motion controller to assemble wire frame blueprints for a part that could be used for a SpaceX rocket.

In a tweet to Iron Man's director, Jon Favreau, Mr Musk admitted be was inspired by the design process in the film (pictured) and said: 'we saw it in the movie and made it real'

He magically puts the parts together in mid-air using hand gestures to manipulate the rocket component as well as to zoom in and out, before showcasing a 3D CAD model of the engine part.

'It's a fun way to interface with what is a complex model,' he said.

An Oculus Rift immersive virtual reality headset as well as free-standing glass projector screens of the type seen in the Iron Man films, can be used with the software, The Huffington Post reported.

Mr Musk said: 'If you can go [into a computer programme] and do what you need to do, understanding the fundamentals of how the thing should work - as opposed to thinking how to make a computer make it work - you can achieve a lot more in a shorter period of time.'

He believes humans currently interact with computers in an unnatural way and it is difficult to create 3D objects using 2D tools.

The final part of the video sees Mr Musk print the rocket component with a 3D laser metal printer, which lays down fine particles of titanium over an initial metal layer.

The particles are melted with a laser and are built up layer by layer to produce the object drawn using hand gestures on the computer.

Mr Musk said the process really allows designers to apply their intuition and turn an idea into a physical object.

He said: 'We're on the verge of a major breakthrough in design and manufacturing.'

Earlier this week he teased the technology on Twitter with an update that read: 'We figured out how to design rocket parts
just w hand movements through the air (seriously). Now need a high 
frame rate holograph generator.'

He said his invention was inspired by the design process in Iron Man and 'we saw it in the movie and made it real,' in another tweet to the film's director, Jon Favreau.

The entrepreneur has previously been compared to the film's character Tony Stark but Mr Musk insists he has no plans to create a suit for himself like the film's protagonist.

He tweeted: 'And, uhh no (zillionth person who asked),
I am not going to make an IM suit, however design by hand-manipulated 
hologram is actually useful.'
