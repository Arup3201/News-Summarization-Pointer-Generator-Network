Marc Marquez's 10-race winning streak in MotoGP is finally over after his team-mate Dani Pedrosa triumphed in Brno on Sunday.

Marquez, who had won every race this season, dropped all the way down to fourth, the first time he has missed out on the podium in a MotoGP race.

The two Repsol Hondas were split by the Movistar Yamahas of Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi in second and third.

Pedrosa had started fifth on the grid but showed his best form as he eventually took the victory by 0.410 seconds from Lorenzo, who had been sixth on the grid.

Rossi's podium finish marked his 245th premier class race, equalling the all-time appearance record of Alex Barros.

He had faced a tough battle from Marquez to third in the middle stages of the race but for once Marquez came off second best.

Marquez can console himself on a disappointing result in the knowledge that he remains 77 points clear in the standings.

Change: Pedrosa's victory was the first time Marc Marquez had not won in the last eleven races

Disappointment: It was the first time Marquez had failed to make the podium in a MotoGP race
