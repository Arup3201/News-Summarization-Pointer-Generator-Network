He went on to Arizona State University where he also played football but quit the program there in 2009.

'He's just tired of football and wants to do something else with his life,' ASU coach Dennis Erickson said at the time. 'He made a decision, and we all understand it,' Erickson said. 'He would have played here eventually.'

Elway’s Facebook page says he graduated from Arizona State University in 2011 after studying business and now lives in Newport Beach, California.
