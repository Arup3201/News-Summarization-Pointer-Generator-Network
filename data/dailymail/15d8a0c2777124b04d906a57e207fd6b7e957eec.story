Apologetic: Pope Francis has revealed that he was forced to cancel a visit to a Papal hospital in Rome last month because he was suffering from a severe headache and nausea

Pope Francis has revealed that he was ill when he cancelled a key appointment last month, saying 'we have to accept fragility'.

The Pope said he was suffering from a severe headache accompanied by nausea when he dropped out of a visit to the Papal Hospital in Rome at the last minute.

Previously the Vatican had claimed he was suffering from 'a slight indisposition'.

The visit on June 27 was to mark the 50th anniversary of the Agostino Gemelli hospital, where Popes John Paul II and Benedict were treated and a suite of rooms is on permanent standby in case of Papal need.

Francis told Catholic TV station TV2000 on Sunday: 'Everything was ready, indeed, as you know, my closest colleagues were already waiting at the Gemelli, but, a few minutes before I was due to leave a severe headache that I had had since the morning and that I hoped would pass got worse, and along with it came nausea, so as things were, I could not go.'

Apologising to the sick and the hospital staff, he said: 'You should know that I really wanted meet you but as you know we are not masters of our own lives, we cannot arrange things to suit us. We have to accept fragility.'

Fears for Francis's health surfaced after he cancelled a series of meetings in May and June.

The Pope, who rises at 4.30am every day, has been a whirlwind of activity since his election, but his advisers have been urging him to take a break after 17 months without a holiday.

Francis has some underlying health problems, including sciatica and had part of one of his lungs removed in his youth.

Close collaborator Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras said: 'We have been asking him to have holidays this year.

'Because last year he didn’t and sometimes he’s very tired. So I think that during August he’s going to retire to rest.'

Disappointed: Staff at the Gemeli Hospital in Rome erected a homemade banner welcoming Pope Francis, but the Vatican announced the Pontiff had an 'unexpected disposition' an hour after he was due to arrive

Traditionally, popes moved to the papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome during the summer months.

Last year, Francis worked straight through the summer.

Papal aides reportedly say that Francis thrives off a fast pace and 'eats work' and finds it hard to relinquish control to others.

Some observers have claimed the pontiff has gained weight since his election and is having difficulty breathing, which they say could be a sign of a heart condition.
