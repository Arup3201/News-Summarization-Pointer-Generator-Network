The Premier League’s top clubs claim they are clean after Barcelona were banned from two transfer windows for breaching rules relating to signing Under 18 players.

Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal insist they all acted within FIFA guidelines over the transfer of young players into English football.

Barcelona have been stopped from signing players in the next two transfer windows for breaching Article 19 of the FIFA statutes.

FIFA raided Barcelona’s La Masia academy over the signings of Dutch-Nigerian Under 14 Bobby Adekanye; three Korean Under 15s (Lee Seung Woo, Paik Seung-Ho and Jang Gyeolhee), France Under 16 Theo Chendri, and Cameroon Under 14 Patrice Sousia.

Barcelona have also been fined £305,000 and the Spanish FA £340,000 after the 
breaching of regulations on player registration.

The
 Spanish champions were investigated after signing 10 minors and 
registering them to play in competitions between 2009 and 2013.

Barcelona’s
 administration has been scrutinised since they were forced to admit the
 total cost to sign Neymar from Santos will be £71.5million, not £47.3m,
 including payments to Neymar and his family.

Former president Sandro Rosell, blamed for breaching FIFA regulations in this latest controversy, was forced to resign.

Barcelona,
 winners of the Champions League three times in the last 10 years, are 
owned by their members and claim to be ‘more than a club’.

Premier
 League clubs attend regular FIFA workshops and all four Champions 
League teams claim confidence in their recruitment procedure for young 
players.

FIFA prevents cross-border moves for players under the age of 18 unless they meet one of three requirements under Article 19.

Young
 players can sign for a club in another country only if they can prove 
their move, such as their parents relocating, is completely unrelated to
 their football career.

Players can also move within other EU countries and the final exception is if the club is within 50km of their home.

After
 Chelsea successfully appealed against a two-year ban for a similar 
infringement after signing Gael Kakuta from Lens, Barcelona confirmed 
last night they would appeal against their transfer ban. A 14-point 
statement read: ‘The rule supposedly infringed exists to protect minors 
against sports clubs that incorporate them without guaranteeing their 
rights and education but those are the very things our youth academy 
stands for.’

The club also 
said all its players were legal residents of Spain and that none had 
played in official games since FIFA began investigating their cases and 
withdrew their registrations.

 sanctions will also  put in doubt the transfers of  German keeper 
Marc-Andre ter Stegen and 17-year-old Croatian Alen Halilovic.

FIFA’s
 statement relating to Barcelona’s conduct said: ‘The disciplinary 
committee emphasised the protection of minors in the context of 
international transfers is an important social and legal issue that 
concerns all stakeholders in football.

‘The
 committee highlighted that while international transfers might, in 
specific cases, be favourable to a young player’s sporting career, they 
are very likely to be contrary to the best interests of the player as a 
minor. Young football players are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse 
in a foreign country without the proper controls.

‘This
 particular fact makes the protection of minors in football by the 
sport’s governing bodies, especially by FIFA, even more important.’

Dilemma: Barca will have to work out a way of coping without goalkeeper Victor Valdes

Problem: Valdes suffered a serious knee injury last week and is due to leave the club in the summer

Deep pockets: Barca have made at least one big-money buy in recent summers, including Fabregas in 2011

The FIFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the Real Federacion Espanola de Futbol (RFEF) and Spanish club FC Barcelona for breaches relating to the international transfer and registration of players under the age of 18. 

The sanctions follow investigations initially conducted by FIFA Transfer Matching System GmbH (FIFA TMS) over the course of last year and subsequently by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee as part of disciplinary proceedings. The RFEF and FC Barcelona were found to have violated several provisions concerning the international transfer and first registration of non-Spanish minors with the club, as well as other relevant regulations with regard to the registration and participation of certain players in national competitions. The investigations concerned several minor players who were registered and participated in competitions with the club over various periods between 2009 and 2013.

Currently, the main provision relating to the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is art. 19 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (the 'Regulations'). According to art. 19, international transfers of players are only permitted if the player is over the age of 18. However, the same article stipulates that international transfers of minor players are permitted under three limited circumstances, and such exceptions may only be granted after evaluation by the sub-committee of the Players’ Status Committee. 

In this respect, the Disciplinary Committee emphasised that the protection of minors in the context of international transfers is an important social and legal issue that concerns all stakeholders in football. Above all, the committee highlighted that while international transfers might, in specific cases, be favourable to a young player’s sporting career, they are very likely to be contrary to the best interests of the player as a minor. On the basis of this analysis, the committee concluded that 'the interest in protecting the appropriate and healthy development of a minor as a whole must prevail over purely sporting interests.'

The Disciplinary Committee underlined that FIFA takes the protection of minors in football very seriously. The protection of minors is one of the key principles included in the agreement concluded between FIFA, UEFA and the European Commission in 2001. The Disciplinary Committee acknowledged that young football players are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in a foreign country without the proper controls. This particular fact makes the protection of minors in football by the sport’s governing bodies, especially by FIFA, even more important.

With regard to the case in question, FC Barcelona has been found to be in breach of art. 19 of the Regulations in the case of ten minor players and to have committed several other concurrent infringements in the context of other players, including under Annexe 2 of the Regulations.

The Disciplinary Committee regarded the infringements as serious and decided to sanction the club with a transfer ban at both national and international level for two complete and consecutive transfer periods, together with a fine of CHF 450,000. Additionally, the club was granted a period of 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned.

With regard to the RFEF, the Disciplinary Committee determined that the association had also violated art. 19 of the Regulations and other provisions in the context of the transfer and first registration of certain minor players. In this respect, the RFEF was sanctioned with a fine of CHF 500,000 and granted a period of one year in which to regularise their regulatory framework and existing system concerning the international transfer of minors in football.

In addition, the RFEF and the club were issued with a reprimand in accordance with art. 14 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code.

The web-based Transfer Matching System (TMS) became mandatory for all international transfers of professional male players within the scope of eleven-a-side football in October 2010. As early as 2009, the use of TMS was obligatory in all applications for a first registration of a minor or an international transfer involving a minor in accordance with art. 19 of the Regulations.

FIFA TMS, founded as a FIFA subsidiary in 2007, established a compliance programme in 2010 to ensure that all international transfers of professional football players are conducted through TMS in accordance with the Regulations, and to control the integrity of club and association behaviour and data in TMS. Cases involving violations of the Regulations, in particular Annexes 2 and 3, are identified and investigated and, where applicable, are then forwarded to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for evaluation and decision. FIFA TMS monitors transfer activity using internally-developed market intelligence, external sources and information received from the FIFA Players’ Status & Governance and Disciplinary & Governance departments.
