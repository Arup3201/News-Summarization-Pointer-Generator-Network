Front gunner Leslie Davenport, from Birmingham, was on the way back from a raid with Bomber Command over Berlin on September 7, 1941 when he was shot down and captured by the Nazis

A man who was fascinated with his grandfather's plane crash behind enemy lines during the Second World War has tracked down the wreckage in a forest in Germany after years of research.

Front gunner Leslie Davenport, from Birmingham, was on a raid over Berlin on September 7, 1941 - one of the most dangerous missions for Bomber Command.

Returning from the German capital, the Short Stirling plane he was flying in was badly damaged by flak and then attacked by a night fighter.

With the starboard outer engine in flames and the wing badly damaged, pilot Alick Yardley gave the order to bail out of the stricken plane.  

Leslie, who was 20 at the time but had already flown in 13 missions in RAF bombers, and the rest of the crew made a lucky escape, but were soon captured and put in prison camps.

Leslie's grandson, Ian Davenport, has been fascinated with the story since childhood. In 2008, 20 years after his grandfather's death, he decided to track down the crash site. 

The 32-year-old said: 'I had been lucky enough to make contact with Alick Yardley's daughter Elizabeth on the internet.

'Sadly, both of our relations had passed away, so I felt it my duty to locate the spot in Germany where the Stirling bomber crashed that fateful night.

'That night Alick gave the order to bail out into the unknown, and the story goes that my grandfather helped him put on his parachute.

'The crew survived the jump and landed in a forest but local security captured them and they were marched into prison camps for the rest of the war.'

Mr Davenport's research suggested Recklinghausen, a city in western Germany, could be the location of the doomed Stirling's final resting place.

He wrote to the local newspaper and contacted the town archive to see if anyone had any information.

'I had numerous replies from eyewitnesses from 1941,' he said.

'Some of them gave me an exact road name where the bomber came down. This made me delve deeper into the web of information I had unearthed.'

Leslie Davenport survived the war and died in 1988. In 2008, his grandson Ian Davenport decided to track down the wreckage of where the plane crashed, finding large chunks of the bomber

After help from town archivist Matthias Kordes, Mr Davenport contacted Uwe Benkel, the head of a search group for missing Second World War airmen, which scours Germany and recovers remains for a proper funeral. 

In the end, the precise location of the crash site was only pinpointed by chance when Rene Karassek, a member of the search group, spoke to a young boy passing on his bicycle, who just happened to know where the wreckage was.

Mr Davenport said: 'A whole host of wreck parts, from bullet cases, aluminium parts, flexi glass and cockpit fragments, were lying on the floor.

'One of the most notable finds was a pressure gauge from the pilot dash board. All had the RAF markings and maker's stamps on.'

Mr Davenport flew out to Germany this summer with his father, Anthony, and Elizabeth Yardley.

He said: 'It was an awe-inspiring visit. It signified the start of a journey that would change my grandfather for the rest of his life.

'He would suffer harsh winters, lack of food as a prisoner of war and never quite know if he would ever make it home.

'I later sent a plaque to Germany and it was recently erected at the crash site by Uwe and Rene at their own cost. I can't thank them enough.'

He added: 'On that visit to Germany I felt I was the closest I had ever been to him since he passed.'

Leslie was eventually repatriated and married Eileen, Mr Davenport's grandmother, in 1946. They went on to have three sons, Anthony, Richard and Michael.

Mr Davenport added: 'He never spoke about the war nor did he go to the reunions.

'I think the things he witnessed he wanted to forget and move on with his life.

'My grandfather was one of the lucky ones in certain respects, but had to endure the harshness of being a prisoner at such a young age and live with this for the rest of his life.'

Mr Davenport is now trying to track down the family of crew members Flight Officer Clive Mayor Hall, Sgt Jack H Boulton, and Sgt Johnny M Sutton.

He has already contacted the family of fellow crew member Sgt Don Owens, and Sgt Arthur Speakman, who is still alive and living in Preston.

RAF Bomber Command's role during the Second World War was to bomb the enemy's airbases, shipping, troops, communications and other industries connected to the German war effort.

Britain had to use long-range bombing after Dunkirk in 1940 until D-day in 1944 as it had no other way of attacking the Germans.

The job fell to RAF air crews - some of who were just 18 - who flew increasingly heavier types of long-range bombers.

It was so successful that Hitler was forced to divert nearly a million men, 55,000 artillery guns and a large part of the German air force on to defending the nation instead of fighting offensively.

Bomber Command flew almost every day and mostly at night during the war to avoid being shot down - but this meant it was difficult to locate small targets.

In 1941 it was decided whole industrial cities should be priority targets. Larger four-engine bombers and improved navigation equipment then followed to create a formidable fighting force.

The repeated and persistent attacks on German cities which followed became a critical factor in the liberation of Europe and the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.

Bomber Command's targeting of large industrial areas was considered controversial by many, with firebombing killed tens of thousands of civilians in Dresden in just two days.

Working class housing areas were targeted because they had a higher density and firestorms were more likely. This disrupted the German workforce and the Germans capability of producing more weapons.

The plan was highly controversial even before it started, but the Cabinet thought bombing was the only option available to attack Germany directly as a major invasion of the continent was years away. 

The tactic has been strongly criticised leading to accusations of war crimes.
