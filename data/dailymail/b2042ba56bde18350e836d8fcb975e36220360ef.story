A man who helped publicize incriminating social media posts from high school football players ridiculing the Steubenville, Ohio, rape victim could face nine years more in jail than the convicted rapists if convicted of hacking-related crimes.

Known as KYAnonymous, 26-year-old hacker and self-employed security consultant Deric Lostutter came forward this week in interviews with Gawker, Mother Jones and The Huffington Post, as the hacker responsible for publicizing social media screenshots and videos posted by Steubenville football players that made fun of the 16-year-old victim and documented her August 2012 rape.

In March, football stars Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were convicted of the rape. They were sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with a maximum stay until they are 21.

Now it seems Lostutter could be charged for his role in the case as well.

In mid-April, F.B.I. agents executed a search warrant on Lostutter's Winchester, Ky., home, the hacker wrote in a post Thursday on the 'hacktivist' group KnightSec's website. KnightSec, led by Lostutter and operating within the Anonymous collective, is known for sticking up for 'victims of rape, abuse, bullying, and more in the face of adversity'.

According to the warrant published by Lostutter, the F.B.I. is investigating him for his role in the hacking of RollRedRoll.com, a fan site for the Steubenville football team. In December, hackers with Anonymous and KnightSec posted a video on the site threatening to release personal information of those involved in the Steubenville rape case if they did not come forward and apologize.

Lostutter told multiple media outlets this week he is the person hidden behind a Guy Fawkes mask in the video, which shows social media screenshots mentioning the rape and victim. He also said he was the man interviewed by CNN in January after Anonymous posted the names of those football players they believed witnessed the rape.

Lostutter told The Huffington Post he didn't hack RolledRoll.com and noted a 22-year-old  known online as Batcat confessed the crime to the Herald Star in February. But he said the screenshots were obtained by him through online activists.

'The tweets, screenshots, Instagrams. ... Pretty much everything you've seen in the media, that came through me,' Lostutter told The Huffington Post.

Describing the search warrant, Lostutter said he originally thought the raid was a delivery.

'As I open the door to great the driver approximately 12 F.B.I. Swat Team agents jumped out of the truck screaming for me to "Get The F*** Down" with m-16 assault rifles and full riot gear armed safety off, pointed directly at my head.,' he wrote. 'I was handcuffed and detained outside while they cleared my house.'

Lostutter wrote he was told not to speak about the raid if he wanted to avoid facing 'additional charges such as "destroying/tampering with evidence".'

'They stated they had been watching me for a long time, prior to Jim Parks, and that I was a good guy, and even joked around a bit about the good things I have done,' wrote Lostutter. 'none the less, sincere or not, They are the FBI and to them I am Anonymous, the embodiment of a dangerous threat according to their m16 assault rifles aimed at me for a computer.'

'They seized my laptop, my girlfriend's laptop, flash drives, music CDs, an external hard-drive, two cell phones and my brother's xbox 360 for some reason,' Lostutter told The Huffington Post.

In the blog post, Lostutter wrote that the items are still being analyzed. 

'I was emailed their intent to send out a "Target Letter" which means they are going to try to indict me for a Federal Offense, (most likely a felony and two misdemeanors) to a secret Grand Jury of 23 individuals, for which I can not be present to state my side, nor state my innocence.,' Lostutter added.

Mother Jones pointed out that if convicted of any hacking-related crimes, Lostutter faces up to 10 years in federal prisonâ€”nine more years than the minimum sentence for the convicted Steubenville rapists.

He is being represented by Jason Flores-Williams, co-founder of the Whistleblower Defense League, and is soliciting donations for his defense online.
