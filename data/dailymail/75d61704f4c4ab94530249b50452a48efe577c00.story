Dentist Joyce Trail who was jailed for conning the NHS out of more than £1.3m has been struck off by the dental regulator

A dentist jailed after she made more than £1million by fraudulently claiming for dental work on the NHS has been struck off by the dental regulator.

Joyce Trail, 51, from Sutton Coldfield, had submitted 100 claims for patients who were dead, and triple-claimed for others during a scam involving 7,141 fraudulent claims.

The General Dental Council has now announced that Trail, who also used her ill-gotten gains to send her grandchildren to private school, had been struck off following a hearing of its Professional Conduct Committee.

A spokesman said: 'The gravity of Trail’s convictions offended fundamental standards of behaviour expected of a member of the dental profession.

'Her convictions go to her character and her actions are incapable of remedy. She has brought the profession into disrepute and remains subject to the lengthy custodial sentences imposed upon her by the court.'

Last October Trail was jailed for six-and-a-half years at Birmingham Crown Court for conspiracy to defraudn and a further six months for perverting the course of justice.

Between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2009, she submitted 7,141 fraudulent claims to the NHS, claiming for patients she had not treated and for providing and fitting dentures for others who were not entitled to have their treatment paid for by the NHS.

She also claimed for providing and fitting dentures for people who didn’t need them and for many others who were dead.

In total she falsely claimed £1,376,423.

At Trail's trial the court heard how she was motivated by 'pure greed' - these diamond rings were owned by her

During the trial, the court heard how Trail had a taste for expensive holidays and Jimmy Choo shoes and used the money she had fraudulently gleaned to lead a lavish lifestyle.

The judge told the jury that the dentist's collection of expensive Jimmy Choos 'would make Imelda Marcos proud' and said that Trail acted 'out of pure greed'.

The court heard how she enjoyed holidays at £1,000-a-night hotel suites in the Caribbean, and designer bags and shoes.

The case was described as one of the most complex taken on by West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service.
