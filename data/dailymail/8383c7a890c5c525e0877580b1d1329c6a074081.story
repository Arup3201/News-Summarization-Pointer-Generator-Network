The Clambook looks like an ultra-thin laptop - but the 'brains of the operation' aren't actually inside the slim magnesium shell.

Instead, the 'power' is provided by an Android handset, linked to the QWERTY keyboard and screen either via a cable or a custom-built dock.

Maker Clamcase claims that the laptop-cum-case will be on sale by year end 2012, offering widescreen video, phone charging while in use, and cooler temperatures than most laptops.

Because the processing is all done outside the actual case, it will be cooler - and hopefully cheaper - than a dedicated laptop

Clamcase already offers QWERTY keypad cases for iPads - but Google's Android operating system is better-built for tinkering under the bonnet.

The Clambook will offer multi-touch gestures such as a double-finger swipe via a trackpad built into the case.

Pricing has yet to be set for the case, but with the processor and other expensive hardware such as the graphics card already paid for, it is likely to be cheaper than comparable laptops, smartphones or tablets.

The 'case' will be far more comfortable for actual 'lap top' user than an actual laptop, says Clamcase - as the processing is done in the smartphone, the Clambook will be up to 10 degrees centigrade cooler than rivals.

The phone will connect to the laptop either via a USB cable or a special charger-cum-dock, which will ensure a connection reliable enough for intensive use such as gaming.

Films will also 'blow up' automatically to fill the screen.

'ClamBook's slim and sleek aluminum design features a widescreen display, full-sized keyboard and multi-touch trackpad,' says the company. 'Add style and functionality while transforming your Smartphone into the ultimate connected device.'
