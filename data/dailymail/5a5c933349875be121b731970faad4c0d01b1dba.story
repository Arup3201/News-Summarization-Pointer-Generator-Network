John Edwards' mistress has revealed that she saw the politician's cancer-stricken wife as 'family' even while carrying on an affair with her husband.

Rielle Hunter has also opened up about the first time she had sex with Mr Edwards, then a presidential candidate, describing it as being 'like a rock concert'.

Ms Hunter is cashing in on her notoriety with a tell-all memoir, which she is promoting in an interview withÂ ABC's 20/20 set to air tonight.

Affair: Ms Hunter and Mr Edwards had a daughter, Quinn, pictured left, though he initially denied paternity

She has repeatedly insisted that Mr Edwards' marriage to his wife Elizabeth, who died of breast cancer in 2010, was over before she began sleeping with him, and even described the terminally ill woman as a 'witch on wheels'.

But in her latest interview, she struck a friendlier tone, saying that she had 'a great deal of compassion and empathy for her suffering.'

Ms Hunter continued: 'I have no desire to bash Elizabeth. Elizabeth is the mother to my daughter's siblings. And she is, indirectly, now my family.'

Talking about the first time she spent the night with the former senator for North Carolina after meeting in a hotel, she described the encounter as having 'an intensity like a rock concert'.

She added: 'Something happened internally with me. I responded... I have not experienced it or felt what was happening before. Ever.'

Father: Ms Hunter has revealed her devastation when Mr Edwards denied that Quinn was his daughter

Ms Hunter, who worked as a videographer on Mr Edwards' unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, spoke of her pain after he denied being the father of their daughter, Quinn - and said she thought he had lost his mind.

'What it meant to me is that he was temporarily insane,' she said. 'I mean, he had really gone off the deep end a bit there, but it was painful to witness.'

Although Ms Hunter was asked to promise that she would not reveal the identity of her daughter's father to anyone except Quinn herself, she refused because she did not want the girl 'growing up under a lie'.

She has repeatedly said that she first became involved with Mr Edwards because she wanted to help him in his political career and personal life - but in the 20/20 interview she acknowledged that her 'help' had not led to success for the politician.

'From the outside world looking in, [it's] like, "Boy, did you sure help him."'

Video: Ms Hunter met Mr Edwards when she was filming material for his presidential campaign

Mr Edwards has not held political office since the scandal, and faced a long-running court case over allegations he had misused campaign funds to hide his affair with Ms Hunter.

He was acquitted of one charge last month, and the others were dropped after a mistrial was declared.

Previous revelations from Ms Hunter's memoir, entitled What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me, include the claim that Mrs Edwards tormented herself by using pictures of her husband and his mistress as her screensaver.

Mr Hunter bragged that she played a role in destroying the 'myth' of John and Elizabeth Edwards, but says the book is part of her 'duty' to Mr Edwards' other children.
