This is the moment a heroic grandmother grabbed a knife-wielding thug and foiled his attempt to rob a corner shop.

Katrina Mooney, 39, has revealed that her only thought was to protect the young female employee who was being threatened by the hooded robber.

CCTV footage recorded her berating the offender and pulling him away from the counter – eventually forcing him out of the Merseyside shop.

Super-gran Katrina Mooney, 39, confronted the hooded robber who was brandishing a knife and threatening a shop worker at News Plus in Wallasey, Merseyside

Despite being confronted with a weapon Mrs Mooney said she felt no fear as she made him abandon his plan to rob News Plus in Trafalgar Road, Wirral.

The 39-year-old mother-of-two, who also has a grandchild, said: 'I was just trying to protect the girl. I had already seen the knife but he was waving it around a lot, but then as he went to walk out the door he waved the knife and I just said: 'Get out'.

'Then I said - What do you think you are doing threatening young girls with a knife – get out.

'When I grabbed him the first time, he pulled away from me and I just pulled him out. I just wanted him outside the shop.'

Mrs Mooney, who works in a shop herself, said she was not scared at any point during the attempted robbery on August 2.

The mum-of-two, who also had a grandchild, said she felt no fear when she stood up to the hooded thug who was brandishing a large blade

'That thought never even entered my head,' she said.

'I was going in the shop to get something and that's when I saw her and heard something was going on.

'He was just staring at me, he didn't say anything until he got over the road and then he said he would be back for me.' 

People have now been stopping her on the street and calling her a 'hero'.

But she insisted her bravery was just a natural reaction to the situation.

She
 said: 'It was just the thought of seeing the knife in the girl's face, 
it was horrible. People are asking me if I'm alright. I'm fine, don't 
worry about me.'

Katrina is then seen dragging the male offender from the shop to make sure that he does not threaten the female employee again

Police have not made any arrests, but they have seized a car  which they believe may be connected to the incident.

The thug entered News Plus in Wallasey just before 6pm, tapping an employee on the shoulder as she refilled the fridge then brandishing the knife.

Shop owner Jane Callister said: 'He came in and the girl who was working was filling up the fridge at the time.

'He came up behind her and I think he first tapped her on the arm. She thought he wanted to get in the fridge so she stepped out of his way not realising.

The super-gran is seen pushing the robber out of the shop and she then follows him outside. People have now been approaching Katrina in the street and calling her a hero

'Then he said, very quietly, 'Don't say anything, get all of the money out the till', and waved the knife at her.

'He pushed her behind the counter and followed her in towards the counter. She went over to the corner and he was stood waving the knife at her.'

After a brief exchange the man left the Trafalgar Road shop - just as Jane arrived from the back with her dogs. 

Jane said: 'This woman, she just grabbed him by the arm and said 'what are you doing?'

The attempted robbery took place on August 2 at News Plus in Wallasey, Merseyside. The hooded thug demanded money and threatened a shop-worker with a knife

'She is a proper hero. He pulled away and she grabbed him again and said 'don't you be threatening a young girl with a knife'.'

Jane, 42, said she knew the courageous customer and would thank her for her heroics with a bottle of wine.

She added: 'It just seemed a bit surreal, the whole thing did to be honest.'

Detectives from Wirral CID have released CCTV stills of a man they want to speak to following the attempted robbery on Saturday August 2.

A man was seen driving off from the incident in a Fiat Punto.

A similar vehicle was later seen on Toronto Road by officers, and two men made off from the vehicle.

Detective Sergeant John Christiansen said: 'Although nothing was stolen, this was an extremely frightening attack on the staff member and we are keen to hear from anyone who recognises this man.'

Anyone with information is asked to call Wirral CID on 0151 777 2262 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
