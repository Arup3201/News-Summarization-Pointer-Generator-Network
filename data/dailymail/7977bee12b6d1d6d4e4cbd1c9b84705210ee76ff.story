Jack Colback believes the retirement of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard has given him the chance to shine on the international stage.

Lampard followed England skipper Gerrard in announcing his decision to step down from the Three Lions set-up this week.

Roy Hodgson has responded by including Colback – and Aston Villa’s Fabian Delph – in his squad for next month’s friendly with Norway and Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland.

Opportunity: With Frank Lampard (right) following Steven Gerrard into retirement, Jack Colback sees this as his chance to shine on the international stage

End of an era: Lampard (left) and Gerrard (right) retired from international football after a dismal World Cup campaign 

Young blood: Both Fabian Delph (left) and Jack Colback (right) have been named in Roy Hodgson's squad for next month’s friendly with Norway and Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland 

And Colback – who signed for Newcastle on a free transfer from Sunderland in the summer - said: ‘It’s another proud moment for me and my family.

‘My football is going really well at the moment and this is the icing on the cake after moving here.

‘There’s been a few retirements since the World Cup, in (Steven) Gerrard and (Frank) Lampard, which has left a hole.

‘I’m not saying I’m necessarily their replacement but there are opportunities there for young players to stake a claim.

‘The manager took a few young players to the World Cup in the summer and has now named a young squad, so that shows you always have a chance.

‘Of course. I’ve got to go there, express myself in training and hopefully be a part of the games. I want to show people what I am capable of and I know that once I’ve experienced it once, I will want to do it again.

‘I’ve just got to go there and do what I’ve been doing at club level, hopefully impress them and stay in the squad.’

Giving youth a chance: Hodgson has named a fairly inexperienced squad for the friendly with Norway and Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland

Highest praise: Roy Hodgson has labelled Jack Colback as the 'ginger Pirlo' after calling the Newcastle midfielder up to the England squad 

Colback only learned of his call up on Thursday morning, as he explained: ‘I was in the gym when Tony (Toward, team administrator) came in and said he had received the paperwork saying I was involved.

‘If it had been anyone else I wouldn’t have believed it, but the manager had pulled me this morning to say that England had rang to check if I was fit, so therefore I may have a chance. When Tony confirmed it, I believed it.

‘To be honest, before today, when it comes to the time of the squad being announced, I’ve never really taken much notice or thought about it.

‘I’ve never been involved before, not even much as a young lad, and sometimes it can be difficult to get in there when you haven’t been around it before.

‘I just always wanted to concentrate on playing well for the team and doing well for the Club - not individual performances.

‘That’s why it has come as a surprise. It is a massive bonus in my career, a challenge I will relish and it will be a great experience.’
