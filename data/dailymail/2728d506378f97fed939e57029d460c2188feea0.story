Alex Reid has gone to extreme lengths to win back the heart of his estranged fiancée Chantelle Houghton.

With the cagefighter issuing a public video plea for his ex-fiancée to take him back, the blonde reality star was spotted looking emotional outside their former family home in Essex.

Since they split less than two weeks ago, they have been involved in a bitter war of words through separate interviews and columns in magazines.

Reid, who revealed on Twitter he has dropped his shared publicist with Chantelle, decided to forget the traditional chocolate and flowers approach to forgiveness, instead opting for a more public apology.

And instead of resolving their differences in private, the cage-fighter has recorded a video, asking for her to take him back.

The video, which was released on Now 
Magazine's website, is just over a minute long and sees him make an impassioned plea for them to sort out their problems.

Public Plea: Alex Reid is hoping for another chance with Chantelle after his emotional message

He said: 'Chantelle, I love you, I really love Dolly and I really want us to work. But things really have to change. There's been so many untruths said, 
and I feel if I don't say something, it's going to get worse and worse. 
Things have to change.'

Despite filming the speech for everyone to hear, he added: 'You can't keep venting your anger to me in your column. Every couple argues but you don't need to tell the world our problems'

However, he leaves the plea on a positive note telling Houghton: 'I know you love me. I hope you love me. Let's sort this out.'

Chantelle
was spotted outside her 
Essex home on Wednesday morning hours after Reid's comments, and she 
seemed to be crying as she bowed her head down while clasping her hand 
over her mouth.

Perhaps she was moved by his very public plea for another chance.

The former Celebrity Big Brother star, who gave birth to daughter Dolly three months ago, announced on Twitter earlier this month that she ended her relationship to Reid after she called the police on him when he allegedly kicked down the door to their Essex house in the early hours of the morning.

Reid had previously spoken to Now Magazine about their problems, and attempted to explain the police incident.

He said: 'I texted Chantelle two hours beforehand to tell her I was coming home.
I rang the doorbell and knocked for five minutes. I called her, she 
didn’t answer. So I sent her a text message saying, "I will knock the 
door down."

'Out of sheer frustration I booted the door. It just came off.'

According to Reid, Chantelle regretted calling the police, revealing: 'Chantelle was crying and telling them not to arrest me. She’s irrational. But it was too late. I was in shock and really upset. I just felt so betrayed by her. I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s totally crazy.'

He added. 'We slept in the same bed. She wanted to hug me, but I wouldn’t let her. The next night I melted a bit and let her.'

Chantelle had recently admitted to her New! Magazine column that she is struggling with the split.

She added: 'People have said I'm looking slim but I don't know why because I'm living on takeaways. I love Nando's, Indian, Chinese food and pizza - I just don't have time to make dinners from scratch. I was a size 10 before I got pregnant and now I'm a 14. My belly's really flabby but I really don't care right now.'
