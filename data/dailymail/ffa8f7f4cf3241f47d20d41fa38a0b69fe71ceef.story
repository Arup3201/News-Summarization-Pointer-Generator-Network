Real Madrid were all smiles on Wednesday night as they headed back to Spain with three invaluable Champions League points after a fright night in Bulgaria.

The European champions beat Ludogorets 2-1  and Instagram posts from goalkeeper Iker Casillas and forward James Rodriguez showed the players in good spirits on their journey home.

The match in Sofia was far from an easy ride for Real as they went a goal down after six minutes thanks to Nascimento da Costa.

From there Madrid were in relative control and, despite World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo missing a penalty, he scored another and Karim Benzema netted the winner.

Rodriguez, signed from Monaco for £63million in the summer, posted a picture on Instagram with team-mates Toni Kroos and Luka Modric following the match.

The photograph, posted to his 4.8 million followers, was accompanied by the caption, 'After an important victory, it's time to go back to Madrid.'

Not one to miss out on a celebratory photograph, veteran goalkeeper Casillas also posted on Instagram, alongside centre-back Sergio Ramos.

Casillas' caption cited the fact that Wednesday's game marked his 142nd Champions League appearance, as well as the message, 'Back in Madrid with 3 points more in our locker'.

Real have a 100 per cent win record in their title defence, beating Basle with ease in their first Group B match.
