Moments after starting a massive house fire in Manhattan that killed one person and left seven others injured, the suspected arsonist allegedly told his roommate, 'We're all gonna die.'

The suspect, identified as Wei Chu Wu, a 45-year-old unemployed man, is accused of torching the kitchen of his apartment on the second floor of 41 Spring Street in the trendy SoHo neighborhood of New York City.

The fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire five-story building.  It took more than 200 firefighters nearly three hours to get the inferno under control, but not before it took the life of an unidentified person.

Aftermath: The deadly fire ravaged the entire five-story building and caused heavy damage to the Pinkberry yogurt shop on the ground floor

The victim was burned so badly that even a gender identification was not immediately possible, The New York Post reported.

The unidentified victim was 
apparently not part of the dispute and was found on the third-floor fire
escape.

According to sources, Wu fought a 
police officer and an off-duty firefighter who rushed into the burning 
building in an effort to rescue the residents.

The tragedy unfolded at around 6.40pm 
when Wu and his wife, 41-year-old Yan He Zheng, got into an argument 
over the man's failure to find employment after losing his previous job 
six months ago.

The verbal spat quickly escalated and 
turned violent when Wu allegedly cut his wife's hand. The couple's 
13-year-old son was at home at the time.

Zheng and the boy fled the building, and a short time later, Wu allegedly told his roommate that they all are going to die.

After seeing the kitchen engulfed in flames, the roommate ran out of the building, followed by the suspected arsonist.

According to the New York Daily News, the suspect shouted: ''I’m going to light this fire and die with you.'

An off-duty firefighter from Los Angeles, who was dining in the area, spotted the flames and ran over to the building where he was confronted by the suspect who wouldn't let him into the building.

The suspect also fought with a police 
officer and New York City firefighters who were trying to enter the 
building.

DNAInfo.com reported that the man was treated at New York Downtown Hospital for bruises and police
officer Paul Rao, a nine-year veteran, was left with a broken hand, Browne said.

Wu was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and assaulting an officer.

Neighbor William Bray told the Post 
that he witnessed the 45-year-old man being led in handcuffs into the 
Fifth Precinct sporting a bloody shirt, no shoes and a black eye.

Bray added that his son is friends with Wu's child, and the family seemed ‘normal.’

The man's wife and son were taken to a local police station ‘in good health,’ the NYPD spokesman said.

About 200 firefighters responded to the 
blaze, which quickly spread to the upper floors and through the roof, 
according to FDNY Chief of Operations James Esposito.

Firefighters had to use the
rear fire escape and portable ladders because the heavy fire had burned
away the stairways.

'We had an extraordinary amount of fire,' said Esposito. 'The fire encompassed all the walls and all the floors.'

Esposito said the fire completely gutted the inside of the building and 
at least nine people, including seven firefighters, suffered minor 
injuries. It was declared under control at 9.20pm.

'It's essentially destroyed and it's not going to be livable for quite some time,' Esposito said of the building.

The fire happened in a Soho neighborhood which is popular with tourists and teeming with bars, shops and restaurant.

A neighbor who lives two buildings down from the fire, Juliet Gentile, 35, said she was home and smelled smoke. She said she went up to her roof and saw the flames.

'As soon as I saw that I got to get out of here,' said Ms Gentile. 'It was coming right out. The whole thing was in flames.'

The American Red Cross said their disasters responders were at the scene to provide emergency housing, blankets, mental health support and other forms of assistance.
