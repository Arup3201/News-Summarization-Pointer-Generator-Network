Property ladder: Young people are having to wait longer to buy their first property - with two-thirds relying on help from their parents

Two-thirds  of first-time buyers are relying on the ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’ to get on the property ladder.

Figures released yesterday by the Council of Mortgage Lenders highlight the crippling impact of high house prices on a generation of young people, who are forced into renting or living with parents or friends.

The CML said 66 per cent of first-time buyers in recent years have had parental assistance courtesy of what has become known as the ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’.

This rises to 72 per cent in London because house prices are so much higher in the capital – £364,000 on average, compared with £163,000 nationally.

Overall, the CML said a typical 
first-time buyer is 29, puts down a 20 per cent deposit – with parental 
help – and has a total household income of £34,000.

In London, they are typically 31, put 
down a 25 per cent deposit – also with help from their parents – and 
have a total household income of £50,000.

By comparison, retired homeowners
over the age of 65 have more than £750billion of ‘property wealth’ tied
up in the value of their homes, the equity release firm Key Retirement 
Solutions said yesterday.

Housing minister Mark Prisk has said it ‘cannot be right’ that so many young people are unable to fulfil their dream of buying their own home.

Speaking at a CML conference earlier this month, the Tory MP, a former chartered surveyor, said the Coalition had inherited ‘a dysfunctional housing market whether it is freehold or leasehold’.

He added: ‘We see 1.6million young people – people in their 20s and 30s – still living with mum and dad because they can’t afford their own place. That cannot be right.’

At the same conference, Martijn van der Heijden, chairman of the CML, said owning a home was still hugely important to millions.

He said: ‘We know – pretty much – that the UK housing psyche, while a bit bruised, still holds homeownership extremely dear.’

But he added that it is ‘more difficult to achieve than it used to be’, and would-be owners need to accept renting ‘is likely to be a tenure in which most new households will spend at least some time.’

Around 17million people in Britain own their own home, around nine million have a mortgage and around eight million have no loan and own their property outright. But the number of first-time buyers getting a loan has collapsed since the credit crunch. There were around 570,000 in 2001, but only 193,000 last year.

Jamie Askew, 26, and his girlfriend Catherine Davies, 25, managed to get on the property ladder last year, thanks to Miss Davies’s father.

The couple, who were childhood sweethearts, had saved a deposit of £7,000. But they were only able to afford their three-bedroom home in Prenton, the Wirral, because Miss Davies’s father, George, used his savings to help them under Lloyds TSB’s Lend a Hand Scheme.

It meant the couple only needed to put down a 5 per cent deposit on their £148,000 home. Mr Davies put around £30,000 into a savings account at the bank, which acts as a guarantee on repayments.

Mr Askew joked that without his help, ‘we wouldn’t have been able to buy for at least 25 years’. He added: ‘Catherine’s dad did everything that he could to help us to buy something that could be our home.’

Last week, a Bank of England report said that the availability of credit ‘continued to restrain first-time buyers’, and added that stamp duty thresholds may also be ‘restraining’ homeowners from trading up to a larger property.

For example, the tax is charged at 3 per cent on a property of £500,000 but it jumps to 4 per cent at £500,001. Duncan Stott, of Priced Out, a first-time buyer campaign group, said: ‘Sky-high house prices are destroying the aspirations of a whole generation of would-be first time buyers. Britain simply can’t call itself a property-owning democracy if homeownership is only open to those from the wealthiest backgrounds.’
