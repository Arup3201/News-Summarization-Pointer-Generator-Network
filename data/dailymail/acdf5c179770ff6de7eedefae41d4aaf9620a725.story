A Swedish football team has told of how they narrowly escaped death after a last-minute decision against booking their players on Germanwings Flight 4U9525.

Four Lufthansa subsidiary flights left Barcelona around the same time this morning, Division 1 team Dalkurd FF, from Borlänge, central Sweden, had players on three of them. 

The team had initially planned to travel on Flight 4U9525 to Düsseldorf, but instead split the team over the three remaining flights from Barcelona, via Germany.

Lucky escape: Swedish Division 1 team Dalkurd FF had initially planned to travel on Flight 4U9525 to Düsseldorf, but instead split the team over the three remaining flights from Barcelona this morning

When the Dalkurd FF delegation of 29 players and staff landed, they found out that the fourth flight had crashed, and the passengers next to them at check in a few hours earlier had died. 

All 144 passengers, including two babies and 16 teenagers from a German high school, and six crew members lost their lives when Germanwings Flight 4U9525 crashed this morning.

The Airbus A320 ploughed into the mountainside in a remote region of the French Alps en route from Spain to Germany at more than 400mph.

'We were supposed to have been on that flight. We checked in with all of the passengers. It's surreal,' Dalkurd FF's sports chief Adil Kizil told Aftonbladet.

'When we got to the airport in Barcelona there were four  flights leaving that time, flying north over the alps.

'Four flights and we had players on three of them. Let's just say we were very lucky.'

Dalkurd FF, formed in 2004 by Kurdish immigrants, play in Sweden's Division 1, the third level in the league system of Swedish football.

The team had been on a week-long training camp in Barcelona and were flying home this morning, and were supposed to have been on Flight 9525.

Mr Kizil told the newspaper how they had tried to fit the entire team on the Germanwings flight, but that the connection time in Düsseldorf to continue their journey home to Sweden was too long.

Instead they split the team onto the three other  flights, with one group flying via München and two others via Zürich.

Mr Kizil said the players are still shocked, and that their thoughts are with the families of the victims.

'All the people on that plane were at the same check-in as us. We also flew with a subsidiary to Lufthansa, so everyone went to the same gates.'

Others have today spoken of narrowly escaping death after missing Flight 4U 9525.

One woman, whose husband has been named by Spanish media as one of the 150 victims, was refused boarding as she was deemed 'too pregnant' to fly.

News website La Voz de Galicia claims Marta Carceller had to stay behind in Barcelona while her husband Josep Sabat Casellas boarded the Germanwings flight, The Mirror reports.  

A man named Manuel Blasco also spoken of his lucky escape, as he was convinced by his wife not to change his flights last minute.

Mr Blasco had intended to swap a Monday flight for the ill-fated Airbus A320 today after waking up with a cold. 

He told Spanish newspaper El Mundo: 'I woke up with a cold and a bit of a temperature.

'I was going to change the flight and fly today with the plane that crashed.

'My wife made me change my mind. I still asked at the Lufthansa desk when I got to Barcelona airport if I could change the flight but they said the plane that ended up crashing was very full and I'd have to pay a lot of money to reserve a seat.

'As I saw it was going to cost quite a lot, I ended up sticking to my original plan and going on Monday.'
