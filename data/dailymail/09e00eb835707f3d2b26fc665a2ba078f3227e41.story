A homeless man who won $50,000 on the Lotto says he will continue living in a tent and use his new-found wealth to help his friends.

Dennis Mahurin, who has been living rough in Bloomington, Illinois, since 1978, couldn't believe his luck after winning the jackpot from a $3 scratch ticket he bought at a petrol station last week.

But the 59-year-old says he will not leave the tent he has lived in for the last 20 years and will instead give $100 each to all the other homeless people he knows.

Describing the moment he found out he had won, Mr Mahurin told News25: 'I scratched it off right here in my tent. I took it to the gas station. I thought it was a thousand dollars. She said 'nope', I said 'oh I messed up didn't I'. She says 'no it's fifty thousand'. And I almost fell over.'

After tax, Mr Mahurin will have around $35,000. He
says he will visit his son, have dental work done, put some in 
savings and maybe buy a new tent.

But his main aim is to use his good fortune to give others in a similar position a helping hand.

'All the other homeless people round here - I've already made up my mind I'm gonna give them each $100,' he said.

Mr Mahurin says he understands why some might find his decision to stay in his tent strange.

'You've got a job and a place to stay,' he explained to one TV reporter. 'I'm living in a tent. Happy as can be. It's in my nature.'

The manager of the gas station, Sandra Rankin, told ABC News that no one has ever won such a large amount at her store before.'Itâ€™s quite exciting, when I got the phone call I was jumping up and down and mostly it was because of who it went to,' she said.

'He has been coming out ever since I started here. He is a great guy, has an awesome sense of humor. I care deeply for him and he is a very decent gentleman. He comes into my store three to four times a day.'
