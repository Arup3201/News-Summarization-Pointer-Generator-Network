The homeless preacher who kidnapped 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart in 2002 and repeatedly raped her before she was found nine months later has been beaten in prison, it has been reported.

Brian David Mitchell, 59, is serving a life sentence without parole in Tuscon, Arizona for the kidnapping of Smart, whom he snatched from her Salt Lake City home at knife point.

A prison source has now revealed that Mitchell was attacked by a fellow inmate at the high security lock-up as other prisoners watched and chanted: 'This is for Elizabeth Smart!'

The source told the National Enquirer that Mitchell was targeted due to his crime against a child, as well as his arrogance and religious preaching.

Targeted: Brian David Mitchell, pictured in 2004, has reportedly been beaten by a fellow inmate who grew tired of his arrogance. He is serving a life sentence for kidnapping Elizabeth Smart in 2002

'He had a target on his back because 
the other inmates hate child molesters,' the source told the Enquirer. 'Even murderers look down on 
them as the lowest of the low.'

The source said that the inmate 
knocked Mitchell to the ground and punched and kicked him 'for several 
minutes' while the kidnapper simply curled up and yelled for him to stop.

He suffered a swollen eye, bloody lip and cuts and bruises in the attack, and has since been moved to another section of the prison that is made up mostly of sexual offenders.

The reports come as Mitchell's former 
stepdaughter takes on a fight of her own; she said she is struggling to 
get his belongings - including clothes and writings - back from the Salt
 Lake City police.

Victim: Elizabeth Smart was just 14 when she was kidnapped from her home at knife point. She was held against her will and repeatedly raped until a cyclist recognized her in 2003 and alerted police

Moving on: Smart, now 25, works as a correspondent for NBC and married Matthew Gilmour, pictured, last year

One 
officer recently told her that the belongings were given to Mitchell's 
niece, but Rebecca Woodridge said her stepfather does not have one, and now 
fears the items could be sold for a profit.

'I'll
 keep trying until I die,' Woodridge told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'I 
won’t give up. I’m not the type to quit, and I don’t give up. 
But I'm tired, and it’s frustrating.'

Woodridge said she maintains regular contact with her former stepfather, who sexually abused her when she was a child. She spoke to him on the phone recently, she said.

'He said he's doing good,' she said. 'That the Lord has been good to him.'

Woodridge has long supported her former 
stepfather, claiming after his conviction that he had not received a 
fair trial and should have been tried out of the state.

Outside the court she said she believed he was insane, adding: 'I think he should have been found not guilty and been sent somewhere to find the reason that he does the things he does.'

The prosecution had claimed that he was faking his mental illness.

Smart was just 14 when she was snatched by Mitchell, a married homeless preacher, and taken to the woods, where he forced her to become his 'second wife'.

Since her rescue, Smart, now 25, has spoken out about her ordeal and her almost daily rapes at the hands of her sick captor.

'I remember lying on the floor of that 
tent feeling so worthless, crushed. I just didn't feel that I could ever
 be worth anything,' she said at a function in April.

The only thing that helped her stay sane was the memory of her mother's love, she said.

'Because
 I found something worth living for, I was able to decide that no matter
 what happened, I would survive,' Smart said. 'No matter what I had to 
face, I would do it as long as it was within my power. Somehow, I would 
see my family again.'

Smart was rescued after nine months when a cyclist saw her in Sandy, Utah - about 20 miles from her family's home - with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, and alerted authorities.

Police took the kidnappers into custody and Smart was reunited with her parents.

As well as touring the country to speak about her ordeal, she is now a contributor to NBC. She married Matthew Gilmour in Hawaii last year.
