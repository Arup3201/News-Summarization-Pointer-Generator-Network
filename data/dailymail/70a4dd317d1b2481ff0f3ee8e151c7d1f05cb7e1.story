Murderer: Babysitter Jessica Fraraccio, 22, admitted to killing little Elijah two years ago

The devastated family of toddler Elijah Nealey who was suffocated by his babysitter two years ago has slammed her five-year prison sentence as 'an insult'.

Jessica Fraraccio, 22, pleaded guilty in October to killing the 23-month-old boy in his Virginia home.

Even though Mike and Jennifer Nealey understood nothing could bring back their beloved son, the grieving couple hoped for a five-decade prison sentence.

The couple were left reeling when Judge J. Howe Brown on Monday sentenced Fraraccio to 50 years jail, but suspended 45 and ordered that she donate $1 every year to charity following her 
release.

Audible gasps were heard in the courtroom when the sentence was announced, which the boy's grandmother described as 'an insult'.

'Once the verdict was read, I didn’t 
even fully comprehend it until after I’d left the courtroom and it all 
started sinking in. The anger has started to really build
 up since Monday. It still doesn't make sense,' 40-year-old Mike Nealey said, according to The Huffington Post.

'His (the judge's) decision shows no respect whatsoever for me, my family, or the life of my son.

'To me, it’s a total failure of our 
justice system. I want everyone to know what the judge thought my son’s 
life was worth...which is pretty much nothing, according to him.'

In handing down the sentence, Brown admitted his decision would please nobody, but didn't consider 50-years jail appropriate.

'Nothing I can do brings back Elijah or makes them (his parents) feel better,' he said, according to The Washington Post. 'Likewise, nothing I can do to punish her is more important than her memory of what she (Fraraccio) did.'

Shocking: Jessica Fraraccio, 22, had cared for little Elijah for seven months before she murdered him in August 2012

Fraraccio, a
 devout Catholic with a 'submissive personality', had cared for little 
Elijah for seven months before she killed him on August 22, 2012, just weeks before his second birthday.

Fourteen months later, she pleaded guilty, after initially saying the toddler had slipped in a bathtub and hit his head.

Fraraccio eventually admitted that while Elijah was eating lunch, she kicked the chair out from under him because he wouldn't stop crying. The boy hit his head on the table, then the floor.

The babysitter became frustrated when the toddler continued to wail.

Enraged, she picked him up by one arm, covered his mouth with her hand and slammed his head on the stair railing.

His body was limp when she put him down. He was dead.

Furious: Mike Nealey, Elijah's dad, said the sentence 'doesn't make 
sense' and that 'the anger has started to really build up since Monday'

For months after the incident, the Healey's believed Elijah's death was accident.

'I feel like I never had the chance to be angry at her (Fraraccio),' Mike Nealey told Manassas Patch.

'By the time we heard that it wasn’t an accident I was so shocked...I believed for months it was an accident.'

Mike Nealey remembers calling Chick fil-A on the day of his son's death to set up a birthday party for the boy.

For Mike Nealey, Brown's decision was an incredible let-down. He doesn't believe Elijah's death was an accident.

Defense attorney Sandra Drewniak told The Huffington Post that Fraraccio had a mental health break and 'just kind of snapped'.

'Ms. Fraraccio in my opinion had what is very similar to shaken baby syndrome,' she said. 'It was a terrible accident and she had no intention of hurting Elijah.'

When Fraraccio eventually gets out of prison, Mike Nealey will have to explain to his two daughters, six and seven, what happened to their brother.

For now, they believe he died after slipping in the tub.

'That’s the story we’ve told them and we haven’t changed it,' he said. 'They’re not old enough to really comprehend it yet. We’ll tell them one day, but not anytime soon.'

A petition calling for Brown's removal from the bench has attracted more than 5,600 signatures.

'This monster deserves the full sentence, and Judge Brown deserves to lose his appointment. It is an outrage,' the petition author wrote.
