A mother has shamed her cyber-bullying daughter online by making her pose with a poster saying she is selling her iPod as punishment.

The image posted online shows the North Carolina teenager, Hailey, holding up a handwritten sign explaining that she is selling the gadget to raise money for an anti-bullying charity.

Hailey's mother posted it to Facebook, where it was seen by another user and shared on Reddit.

'I
 make poor choices with social media,' the sign reads. 'As punishment, I am selling my 
iPod and will be donating the money to the Charity Beat Bullying... Because bullying is wrong.'

After the image was shared on reddit last week, numerous commenters accused Hailey's mother, Cara Schneider, of using her own bullying tactics against her daughter.

Shamed: A mother snapped this picture of her teenage daughter after she allegedly caught her bullying online. The photo has since gone viral, but some commenters have accused the mother of being the bully

'Humiliating your child to teach her not to humiliate other children? Gee, I wonder where she gets it!' one wrote.

'This is terrible parenting,' another added. 'It's things like this that make kids hate their parents. This will only make her behave worse out of spite.'

But Schneider has defended her actions and said she does not regret posting the photograph as she wants her daughter to act appropriately towards others, the Examiner reported.

She explained that the photo was just the latest way to discipline her daughter following a long line of other methods, including grounding her and making her carry out manual labor.

She added that the photograph was posted on a Facebook page for a local yard yard sale so that the iPod could be sold, and that she had no intention of other people posting it elsewhere; she had shared it on Facebook before another user posted it to the reddit page without her knowledge.

No regrets: The girl's mother, Cara Schneider, right, said she does not regret posting the picture on a Facebook group for a yard sale because she wants her daughter to act appropriately towards others

'I'm not worried about the negative that has been said about her punishment,' she wrote on her Facebook page. 'I am her mother and I did what I thought was best given the circumstances. I've tried other punishments, and this fit the crime. I don't regret a thing.'

Other reddit users supported her parenting choices.

'This makes me happy, because so often people only get caught after it's far too late to help the victims,' one wrote. 'Brava, mom. Brava.'

She's not the first parent to shame their teenager publicly.

Last year, a dad made his 15-year-old daughter wear a t-shirt showing his face and the message 'Try Me!!' to school after she disobeyed him over curfews.
