The Duchess of Cambridge is suffering from crippling morning sickness, but another malady is starting to sweep the nation: royal baby fever. 

And it seems the second outbreak is set to be just as virulent as the first, with betting now suspended on whether the Duchess of Cambridge, 32, will be having twins.

A surge of over 200 wagers caused bookmaker William Hill to first slash the odds from 20-1 to 9-1, and then, due to a suspicious number of new accounts being opened, suspend betting, followed by Coral less than 12 hours later.

The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to be just over 12 weeks pregnant with her second child

'The fear is that so many people suddenly placing bets implies that there has been a leak of information.

'We are now convinced that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to twins following the sheer volume of bets we have taken this afternoon,' said Coral’s Nicola McGeady.

'There has been huge support for royal twins since the news was announced, but today’s gamble is the biggest indicator yet that someone knows something we don’t.'

Another spokesperson for William Hill, Joe Crilly, said: 'Getting 200 plus bets in one-and-a-quarter hours, in that market, is incredible.

'Usually new accounts open when somebody bets on a new football manager, where it would be easy to suggest the punter had inside information.'

While in terms of placing wagers this obviously constitutes dishonest betting, most of the public will be more interested in why so many are suddenly so sure of a double royal birth.

Kate is believed to have just passed the 12-week gestational period, a time when expectant mothers usually have their first scan - known as the 'dating scan'.

Twins? Bookmakers William Hill have suspended betting on the Duchess of Cambridge having two babies 

While little can be seen on this scan due to the small size of the foetus, one of the things that is determined, along with the baby's growth and heartbeat, is whether the mother is expecting twins or triplets.

There is, at present, no suggestion that the Duchess has had this initial scan, or if she has, what it might have revealed.

However, this sudden rush of betting will certainly raise speculation over whether Prince George will soon be joined by multiple siblings. 

When contacted by the MailOnline Clarence House refused to comment on the speculation.
