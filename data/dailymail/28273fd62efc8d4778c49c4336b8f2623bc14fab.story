A woman told she was infertile after gruelling treatment for a brain tumour has given birth to a healthy baby.

Nicole Malloy, from Halbeath, Fife, feared the worst when doctors called her in after spotting something on a routine scan.

‘Hysterical’ that her cancer had returned, the 22-year-old couldn’t believe it when she was told she was in fact 19 weeks pregnant.

Nicole Malloy, 22, was told she would not be able to have a baby because of treatment she had received for a brain tumour. So, she was delighted when she was told she was pregnant with Denny

She gave birth to her son Denny on December 3, nearly a month premature.

When she was just four years old Miss Malloy escaped without long term health problems after developing meningitis.

However, at the age of 11 she was diagnosed with a brain tumour.

The golf ball-sized tumour was discovered after she complained of headaches and double vision.

After a successful operation to remove the tumour, she underwent several further operations to insert a pressure-relieving shunt into her head.

The cancer left her with balance and memory problems.

Miss Malloy was hysterical when doctors told her they had found something unusual on a routine scan as she feared it meant her cancer had returned. She was delighted when she was told she was actually pregnant

Miss Malloy was diagnosed with a brain tumour when she was 11 and she had to have surgery and radiotherapy. She was devastated when doctors told her she would not be able to have children

Denny was born almost a month early weighing 5lb 12oz but he is healthy despite his mother's health problems

The radiotherapy she received also damaged her hormones and disrupted her menstrual cycle - doctors warned she would not be able to have children and would undergo an early menopause.

So when doctors told her they had discovered something during endocrine and oncology check-ups she feared her cancer had returned, or menopause had begun.

The new mother said: ‘When I was going through my illness, I just wanted to die. I couldn’t see myself getting better. Every step I took I would just fall back.

‘So when I was told I wouldn’t have children I was just devastated. When the doctor told me I was pregnant, I was just so happy, I couldn’t believe it.

‘I didn’t think I was pregnant - I thought I was going through early menopause.’

Until she was told she was pregnant, Miss Malloy thought she was going through early menopause

She admitted that prior to discovering she was expecting she had been to a spiritualist event in Glasgow - where she was told she would have children.

She said: ‘When I was told that, I thought, no, that’s not going to happen.

‘Now when I look at Denny, I am just so happy. Sometimes I just can’t believe it - he’s just a wee miracle.’

Her mother, Angie Kempson, 45, said: ‘The cancer can affect her spine as well and on July 29 she went to the Western General in Edinburgh for a brain and spine scan.

‘When we got back we got a phone call saying that something had showed up and she should go and see the GP. Nicole was just hysterical.

Doctors were worried baby Denny might be affected by drugs his mother was taking as they should not be taken during pregnancy. Luckily, they do not appear to have affected him

‘When we got to the doctor we were told something had shown up but it wasn’t at the top, it was at the bottom of the spine.

‘They thought she might have a cyst on her ovaries - or that she might be pregnant.

‘She was crying and I was being sick, because she had been on medication and treatment she shouldn’t have been on when you’re pregnant.

‘The doctor referred her to the antenatal clinic at Queen Margaret Hospital but we went out and paid for a scan because we were so worried, and found she was 19 weeks pregnant.’

Denny was delivered by C-section on December 3, weighing 5lb 12oz, 26 days before his due date.

However, little Denny had a ‘massive’ haemangioma - lump of blood vessels - on the back of his neck, and Ms Kempson admitted she ‘freaked’ given her daughter’s medical history.

However, doctors said it’s not life-threatening and he’s on medication to shrink it.
