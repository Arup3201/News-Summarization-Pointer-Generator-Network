Having just been released from prison, you might have expected prolific burglar David Stedman to try to keep on the straight and narrow.

But not only did the drug addict break into another house almost straight away, he then admitted the crime to police officers who called at his home to check the conditions of his licence.

'Are you here about the burglary,' he asked them, then proceeded to tell the stunned officers the address of his victim and show them what he had stolen.

Jailed: Judge Patrick Hooton, left, sentenced career criminal David Stedman, right, to three years in prison after he confessed to a burglary to police who had come to his home on an unrelated matter

Stedman, 43, was on parole from a 
42-month sentence imposed for ten burglaries when he decided to break 
into a house on a whim as he walked past.

He stole a computer, jewellery box and cash after breaking through a fence and smashing a window at the back of the property.

The next day police called at his home
in Gosport, Hampshire, to discuss an issue over his release on licence.
But as soon as he saw the officers, who knew nothing about the 
burglary, Stedman started talking.

Daniel Reilly, defending him at 
Portsmouth Crown Court, explained: 'When the police attended in relation
to his licence situation he was heard to immediately ask “Is this about
the burglary?”.

'They replied “No, what burglary?”. He told them about the burglary he had committed and provided all the information.'

Stedman had a string of more than 100 previous convictions, 27 of which were for burglary, and had only just been released from prison when he committed this latest offence, Portsmouth Crown Court, pictured, heard

Prosecutor Eileen Sproson said: 'The police asked Mr Stedman details of the home he burgled and he told them the address.

'They attended the address and the occupant confirmed they had been burgled. All the property was returned.'

Mr Reilly added: 'Mr Stedman is realistic.

'He understands he is going to receive a custody sentence.

'He has a drug problem, he says it was getting worse. It was getting out of control.'

The court heard that Stedman has more than 100 previous convictions, including 27 for burglary.

Sentencing Stedman to three years in 
prison, Judge Patrick Hooton said: 'After you had been given 42 months 
for a string of burglaries you came out on licence and off you went and 
committed another one.

'You know as well as I do there is no 
excuse for it. You decided to go in and do another burglary and take 
people's stuff from their home.

'Every time someone is burgled it's a serious intrusion,' Judge Hooton added.
