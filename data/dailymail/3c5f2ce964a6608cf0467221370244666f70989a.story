Gonzalo Higuain's brother and agent insists he has not spoken to Liverpool and claims the Argentina striker is happy at Napoli.

The Argentina international has been strongly linked with a move to Anfield in the winter transfer market.

The arrival of Italian forward Manolo Gabbiadini to Napoli from Sampdoria last week has increased speculation of Higuain's possible departure.

Argentina international Gonzalo Higuain has been linked with a move to the Premier League with Liverpool

The player's brother and agent, Nicolas Higuain, claims the striker is happy at Serie A side Naopli

However, when asked about the Barclays Premier League club's reported interest, Nicolas Higuain told Italian radio station Crc: 'I don't speak English only Italian, French and Spanish.

'First of all, I have not spoken to any club because they have not contacted me and secondly, it would be disrespectful to Napoli.

'(Napoli president Aurelio) De Laurentiis is a great person, a man of honour and I couldn't behave incorrectly.

Th signing of Italian forward Manolo Gabbiadini added to speculation that Higuain could leave Napoli

'We're not thinking about leaving Napoli.

'I'm confident that the team can finish third (in Serie A to qualify for the Champions League), then we'll see about Gonzalo's future.

'I haven't spoken with any team.

'Gonzalo is calm, he has a contract with Napoli and he's not planning to leave because he's happy.'

The 27-year-old reached the 2014 World Cup final with Argentina before losing to Germany

Liverpool are in need of more firepower, especially given Mario Balotelli's struggles in front of goal

Higuain, 27, joined Napoli in the summer of 2013 from Real Madrid and is under contract with the Naples outfit until June 2018.

The South American was a member of Argentina's squad that finished runners-up Germany at the World Cup last year in Brazil.

Higuain has scored nine goals and set up three more in 18 league appearances for Napoli this season.
