Michael Douglas’s former wife has criticised Catherine Zeta Jones after apparently accusing her of selling her private life.

Diandra Douglas launched the thinly-veiled attack on the Welsh actress in an interview from the home in Majorca which she still shares with the Hollywood star.

It seems to be related to Zeta Jones and her husband selling pictures of themselves and family – including their 2000 wedding – to glossy magazines.

Asked about rumours that Zeta Jones, who is back with Douglas after a brief separation, had tried to buy her half share of the Spanish villa, she retorted: ‘It’s not true. Sometimes people say things without the slightest proof.

‘Why would someone who doesn’t speak Spanish or the local Majorcan language or knows nothing about this culture want a house here? She doesn’t even come here much.’

And responding to a question about why she was ‘less visible’ on the Spanish resort than the Hollywood actors now, Diandra, 56, added: ‘That’s because I don’ t believe in showing off.

‘I’ve never sold photos or kept money from anything and I’ve always given everything away to charity.

‘I’m proud to be able to say that I’ve never turned my private life into showbusiness.

‘Too much public exposure affects children.’

Diandra, Douglas’s wife of 18 years, also revealed she and her jailed son Cameron, 35, ‘meditated for his freedom’ every night for 15 minutes at the same time.

Both the Wall Street star, and Diandra have spoken out in support of Cameron who was sentenced to nine-and-a-half-years in prison in 2010 for selling methamphetamine and heroin possession.

A US judge nearly doubled his sentence after he was found guilty of repeatedly breaking prison rules by arranging to get drugs. He was placed in solitary confinement for several months after failing a prison drugs test - and is not scheduled for release until 2018.

Diandra said she can now visit him every other weekend following his release from solitary but told respected Spanish newspaper El Mundo: ‘Putting a drug addict in a jail is like putting a diabetic in a cake shop without treatment.

‘It’s horrible that someone with money and famous parents should receive such tough punishment.’

She also insisted reports she had lost a recent court battle for half Michael Douglas’s salary and royalties from 2010 Wall Street sequel Wall Street 2, were wrong.

Diandra was widely reported to have lost a fight to get her hands on the huge fee the actor earned for his role as Gordon Gekko.

But she insisted she had instructed lawyers to halt her claim after learning he was ill with cancer.

Douglas, 69, and Diandra divorced in 2000 after 23 years of marriage which she entered while just 19. But last year, he admitted that they should have split much sooner.

‘I know I’m going to get into trouble here,’ he said. ‘I have nothing against her and in fact I’m very fond of my first wife. But we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier.

‘It took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counsellor to resolve problems, it’s in his interest to keep the marriage going.

‘Because if I end the marriage he’s got no business. I think Diandra would probably say the same thing. That’s the only clear regret that I have.’

He recently revealed he is relishing being a father a second time around.

‘I love kids and I love having had this second chance to have a family,’ he said. ‘There’s something about the innocence and unequivocal love that children have. You’re just their dad and there’s a complete love without them having any judgment, so I can enjoy that a lot.’

Douglas - who has recovered since he was diagnosed with stage-four throat cancer in 2010 - said he likes playing with his children.
