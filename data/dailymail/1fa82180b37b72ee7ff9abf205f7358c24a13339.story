Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez's fiancée has been granted the immunity sought by prosecutors in his murder trial.

The decision released by a judge Tuesday means that Shayanna Jenkins, 25, could be compelled to testify or face time prison time.

Lawyers prosecuting Hernandez, 25, for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd, 27, filed the petition for immunity last month.

Shayanna Jenkins, 25, has been granted immunity in the trial of her fiancée, meaning that evidence she provides cannot lead to her prosecution

Aaron Hernandez, a former star for the NFL's New England Patriots, is charged with the murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd

Bristol County, Massachusetts, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh held a closed hearing at that time, but did not immediately release a decision.

All details of the petition were sealed at the time it was filed. The court said it was because the petition contains grand jury testimony.

It wasn't clear when or if Jenkins would be called to testify.

The grant of immunity may mean that the football player's girlfriend will not be able to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if she takes the witness stand.

Prosecutors have said Jenkins lied to a grand jury dozens of times including when she said she didn't know what she did with a box she took from the basement of their home. 

They say it contained possible evidence leading to Mr Lloyd's killer.

Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury. 

Evidence she gives in Hernandez's case could not be used to prove she lived to the grand jury under the immunity.

Her testimony may be pivotal in the case for Hernandez, alleged accomplice Carlos Ortiz and alleged accomplice Ernest Wallace.

Hernandez also allegedly asked his girlfriend to hide or destroy the .45 Glock that prosecutors suspect he used to shoot Mr Lloyd, according to Sports Illustrated.

The gun used to kill Mr Lloyd has never been found. 

Mr Lloyd, who played semi-professional football, was dating Jenkins' sister Shaneah, 23, at the time his body was found shot in an industrial park near Hernandez's home.

Shayanna Jenkins has been seen often in court during the trial, sitting behind Hernandez to support him.

The two, who were sweethearts at Bristol Central High School in Connecticut, have been heard whispering 'I love you' to each other and occasionally joking together.

Jenkins last week also shared notes with Hernandez's defense team after her sister testified against the athlete.

The linebacker's fiancée still lives in the couple's North Attleborough mansion with their 2-year-old daughter.

Hernandez's trial is expected to resume Wednesday after a two-day snowstorm delay.
