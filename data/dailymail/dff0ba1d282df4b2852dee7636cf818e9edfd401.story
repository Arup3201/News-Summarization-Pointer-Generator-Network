A charming, never-seen-before picture of Prince George emerged on social media last night.

The portrait shows the adorably chubby-cheeked royal, who would have been around ten months old, being cuddled by his glamorous mother and with his father Prince William standing behind.

According to sources, it was taken by photographer Jason Bell for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in March this year at the same time as a series of official pictures that were released to the media.

A newly released royal portrait shows an adorably chubby-cheeked Prince George posing with his parents. The framed picture was sent as a thank you to to people involved in their then forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand

In line with other members of the royal family, it was commissioned by the couple to send as a ‘thank you’ to people involved in their then forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand.

The portrait, which was first posted anonymously on a photo sharing website before being picked up by royal enthusiasts worldwide, is contained in a frame embossed with William and Kate’s cyphers and featuring their signatures underneath.

There is no suggestion who the delightful gift was sent to, but a glass of champagne can be seen reflected in the glass frame.

A Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed that members of the Royal Family frequently sent photographs of themselves as gifts to members of the public.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said last night: 'I can confirm it is a photo the Duke and Duchess used as official gifts on their tour to New Zealand and Australia. It was taken by Jason Bell before the tour.'
