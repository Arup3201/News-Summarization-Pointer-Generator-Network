Tragedy: Mandy Shepherd, 27, who suffered from mitochondrial disease, died after collapsing in the bath

A young woman who refused to be beaten by bullies who laughed at her incurable medical condition has collapsed and died whilst taking a bath.

Mandy Shepherd, whose illness left her with slurred speech, muscle weakness and drooping eyelids, had been mocked in the street and attacked after callous thugs spotted her symptoms and wrongly assumed she was a drug addict.

But despite police being unable to trace one suspect, the 27-year-old vowed not to be scared and carried on taking the same route home whenever she went to volunteer at a youth centre.

Tragedy struck after Miss Shepherd suffered a fatal cardiac arrest at her home in Plungington, near Preston, Lancashire.

She was discovered lying under the water by her stepfather who went to check on her.

Tests revealed her death - two days before she was due to go on a family holiday to Cornwall - was linked to Mitochondrial Disease an incurable illness which she was diagnosed with at the age of 13.

Her family have now vowed to campaign for more awareness about the condition and are raising funds for the Children’s Mitochondrial Disease Network after a coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes.

Her mother, also Mandy, 55, said: 'Mandy was brave but stubborn.She had her own mind and was very independent and she was very friendly and would do anything for anybody if she could.

'Sometimes she would get frustrated with her condition but she wouldn’t complain, she just got frustrated if she was struggling to do something but she was determined she would manage. She didn’t moan about it.

Condition: The incurable disease meant she had slurred speech and drooping eyelids

'She was only small but you knew she was there. She had a good sense of humour and she was always joining in.

'We knew there was no cure for her condition but we just thought that she would end up bed bound. We didn’t think she would die so young.

'The disorder seems to manifest in different ways and people don’t always have the same symptoms. In recent months her walking really deteriorated, she couldn’t walk very well.

'Mandy had been attacked and abused in the street because people assumed she was under the influence of drugs because of her droopy eyes and because she stumbled when she walked.

'It was sickening - but it used to annoy us more than it did her and she would still walk back the same way. She wouldn’t let anyone stop her.”

Stepfather Reg Gandy, 61, said: 'She was going to get as much out of her life as she could and she wouldn’t let anything or anyone stop her. When you consider what she had been through, a lot of people would’ve given up.

Family: Her mother, also Mandy (right) said her daughter was 'brave' and 'stubborn'

'One night she had been at the youth centre and was walking home. A man said something to her like that she was a smack head or that she was smashed out of her head.

'She just ignored him and he grabbed her and smashed her against the wall.

'An elderly couple were walking nearby and he ran off.

'At the time we reported it to the police but there was no CCTV and Mandy wasn’t able to give a proper description because it was dark. She was shaken up but she wasn’t going to let it bother her.

'Mandy just put it down to being one of those things and it wasn’t the first time but it was usually name calling. She didn’t let it stop her though and she would still come back the same way.'

He added: 'She was an incredibly brave woman. She wouldn’t let anything or anyone stop her doing anything.

Her appearance meant she was mocked in the street by passers-by who thought she was a drug addict

'She was amazing and so strong if you consider what she had been through. She had been affected by the disorder in every aspect.

'She was partially sighted and couldn’t hear properly, she had difficulty walking and her arms weren’t strong. She had a hard life. She just didn’t let the illness beat her but it did in the end.'

The hearing at Preston was told Mandy was 11-years-old when her eyelids began to droop. After a routine eye test at secondary school it led to her being referred to hospital where she was diagnosed with Mitochondrial Disease two years later.

The disorder - which affects the body’s energy supply - began to affect her speech, hearing and movement and other symptoms included poor growth and muscle weakness.

A week after her 21st birthday she was fitted with a pacemaker after suffering from collapsing episodes and went on to develop epilepsy.

Strength: She stood up to bullies by walking the same route to the youth centre where she volunteered

In the latter months of her life she was having difficulty getting in and out of the bath and on the day of her death, Mr Gandy decided to check on her.

He told the hearing: 'I had gone out of the house and came back, I went out of the house for five minutes at the most.

'I came back and decided to go upstairs to see if she was okay because I had been out for a minute.

'I opened the door and she was lying there in the bath underneath the water on her back, her arms were by her side as though she had just slipped down.

Hearing: The inquest in Preston found Miss Shepherd died as a result of her illness, which she was diagnosed with at the age of 13

'There was no water anywhere else in the bathroom. There was no evidence she had tried to get out or and there was no water splashed.'

Consultant Tim Dawson who carried out a post mortem ruled out that Mandy had drowned and offered a cause of death of natural causes, Mitochondrial Cytopathy with Kearns-Sayre Syndrome.

He said: 'I suggest a catastrophic event has taken place leading to cardio respiratory arrest. Whatever happened happened whilst she was in the water.

'When she went under the water she wasn’t breathing. She died and just slipped under the water.'

Coroner Mr Simon Jones said: 'This could have happened absolutely anywhere'
