I'm a Barbie girl: Victoria Wild, 30, shows off her sex doll look which she spent £30,000 on plastic surgery to achieve. Victoria splashed out on rhinoplasty, permanent lip implants, Botoxand three breast enhancements taking her to a size 32G, to make her look like an inflatable love toy

The model from Cannes, France, has funded her plastic surgery obsession with her earnings as a model, along with the financial help of her boyfriend.

Victoria said: 'Who wouldn't want to be treated like a bimbo doll? It's such a sexy look.

'People stare at me in the street and I love the way I stand out.'

Victoria says her obsession with looking like a doll began whilst she was a teenager in Lativia.

As she was: Victoria, pictured before her transformation age 23, always dreamt of looking like a sex doll and started saving up her earnings from modelling work so she could afford a first breast augmentation

New look: When she was 25, she met her boyfriend Simon who encouraged Victoria's dreams of looking like a sex doll and she has since splurged on surgery, saying she's never felt more confident and gets men staring at her in the street

She said: 'I had a very normal childhood, living in a small village in the countryside.

'I was very slim and blonde and people would call me Barbie. But I hated my small A cup boobs. I didn't like myself or the way I looked. I had an inferiority complex.

'I didn't know about plastic surgery at that age but I would always dream about resembling a sexy bimbo doll with huge breasts and insanely big lips.

'I loved the way dolls looked and how sexy they were. They are so bright and bold. It was this fantasy in my head.'

After and before: Victoria said that when she was in her early twenties, right, she would always dream about resembling a sexy bimbo doll with huge breasts and insanely big lips - so she transformed herself, left

First taste of surgery: In 2011, Victoria had her first surgical procedure to alter her body, undergoing three £25,000 breast augmentations in Hungary to become her dream 32G size. Here, she shows off the results

Transformation: In 2014, she shelled out £3,000 on rhinoplasty to resemble the smaller, thinner nose of a plastic doll and has also had lip implants and Botox, costing over £2,000

However when Victoria began working as a glamour model at the age of twenty, she became aware of cosmetic surgery.

'I learned about boob jobs and plastic surgery. I realised it was possible to make my dreams come true. I could become the sexy, bimbo doll I had always envisioned in my head.'

Victoria started saving up her earnings from modelling work so she could afford a first breast augmentation.
