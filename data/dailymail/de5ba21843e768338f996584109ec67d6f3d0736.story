The father of a little girl who has been missing for two years and presumed dead is facing a charge of 
domestic violence assault.

Justin DiPietro of Waterville was arrested at 11.15pm on 
July 6 after a lieutenant saw him grab and push a woman on a Maine street. 
Portland police identified her as DiPietro's former girlfriend and say she 
wasn't injured.

DiPietro's 
daughter, Ayla Reynolds, hasn't been seen since she was reported missing
December 17, 2011, from DiPietro's mother's home in Waterville, where 
DiPietro lived.

Arrest: Justin DiPietro of Waterville, Maine, was arrested on a domestic violence charge after a police officer saw him grab an ex-girlfriend. His young daughter Ayla Reynolds has been missing for two years

Ayla was 20 months old at the time. Police have called the case the biggest criminal investigation in Maine history.

DiPietro,
who's free on bail, couldn't be reached for comment. His cellphone 
number is no longer in service and a new number in his name could not 
be located.

The case of Ayla Reynolds drew 
national attention as hundreds of searchers looked for her in December 2011
in the central Maine town of Waterville.

Ayla, a toddler with sparkling blue eyes and a bright smile, was at her father’s home on December 17 when first reported missing.

The disappearance prompted a massive 
search by Waterville and state police, game wardens, and FBI agents who 
canvassed neighborhoods and lowered several streams.

A body has never been found and police said last year that it is 'likely' the child is dead.

Mystery: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, 
was reported missing in December 2011 by her father 
Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed 
the previous night

The disappearance prompted a massive 
search by Waterville and state police, game wardens, and FBI agents who 
canvassed neighborhoods and lowered several streams.

Police
announced that they didn't think Ayla was abducted from her bedroom. 
They also confirmed the presence of her blood in the home and said the 
father and two other adults in the home that night 
know more than they've told detectives, creating an air of suspicion.

Only
Ayla's and two other cases involving young children remain unsolved in 
Maine, Stephen McCausland, a state police spokesman said in an interview last year. 

Ayla was in the care of her father Justin as her mother Trista Reynolds was in a ten-day program for substance abuse at the time.

Ms Reynolds has since moved to a small town outside of 
Portland, where she lives with her toddler son Raymond and her boyfriend.

Grim discovery: Ayla's blood was found in DiPietro's home during a police investigation, but no one has been charged in the case

Trista Reynolds
said last year that police confirmed to her that DiPietro walked out of an interview 
when he was confronted with photos showing Ayla's blood in the basement.

They also confirmed that before dialing 911 the morning that Ayla was 
reported missing, DiPietro called his friend, an insurance agent who 
wrote a life insurance policy on Ayla.

In May 2012, law
enforcement officials said for the first time that they believe 
Ayla is no longer alive.

The
toddler had last been seen wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 
'Daddy's Princess' on them. She had a cast on her broken left arm.

Before
a news conference that would announce police's tragic conclusion for 
the girl, detectives called Ayla's parents to deliver the somber news 
that they no longer believe she'll be found alive.

Asked
if police believe a crime was committed, Maine State Police spokesman 
Stephen McCausland said: 'We believe foul play has been involved... 
this is a criminal investigation.'

Father: Justin DiPietro, left, told cops he last saw Ayla, right, when
he put her to bed. He said she was wearing green 
pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them
