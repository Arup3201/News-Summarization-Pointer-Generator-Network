A brand new app aims to ensure Britons can always enjoy a cold pint in a sunny beer garden this summer (provided the warm weather actually makes an appearance of course).

Called Pints In The Sun, the smartphone and desktop application uses 3D building data to figure out structure forms and factor in where the sun will be at certain times of the day.

London-based digital agency POKE recently developed the nifty web tool that allows you to easily find a nearby pub that won't be in the shade without trawling the streets.

Pints In The Sun uses building outline data from Open Streetmap located via FourSquare to render buildings in 3D.

It then factors in where the sun will be in the sky at any given point in the day, according to a Solar Almanac Calculation.

Firstly users either search for a pub directly or simply browse the map to find one they like the look of nearby.

Then they use the straightforward slider interface at the bottom of the map to see the 3D city and exactly when shadows will cast over the chosen drinking hole at any time of the day.

You can even figure out which corner of the pub 
garden is best for ensuring optimal sun exposure, or supposedly sheltering from the rain depending on the conditions.

The app is still in experimental stages, so it could get niftier still. Perhaps a cloud-spotter or temperature reader for the coldest pint available, might we suggest?
