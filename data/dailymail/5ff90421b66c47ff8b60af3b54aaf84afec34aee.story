Following the capture of Mexico's richest and most dangerous drug lord on Saturday, questions are now being asked about the whereabouts of his 24-year-old beauty queen third wife who gave birth to two of his children in 2011.

Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was nabbed in a U.S.-backed raid on a resort condo in Mazatlan, after his former bodyguards pointed Mexican officials to the elusive kingpin's compound of seven homes in the Pacific coast town of Culiacan.

It seems Guzman - who is worth an estimated $1billion - was getting tired of living the safe life after 12 years in hiding, and let down his guard to enjoy his wealth in the resort town popular with American tourists.

Guzman was caught with an unidentified woman, but his young wife and former-beauty queen Emma Coronel was unaccounted for.

Coronel is either Guzman's third or fourth wife and they were married in 2011 when she was just 18-years-old. She caught his eye after winning the Miss Coffee and Guava beauty contest.

Coronel, who is the daughter of one of Guzman's top deputies, Ines Coronel Barreas, was last seen re-entering Mexico in August 2011.

The then 22-year-old had just given birth to Guzman's twin daughters at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, north of Los Angeles, California.

Where is she: Guzman's wife and former beauty queen Emma Coronel was not accounted for in news of the raid

Because Coronel is both an American and Mexican citizen - she is allowed to travel freely between the two countries.

With
 the DEA and U.S. Marshals Service reported to have been 'heavily 
involved' in Guzman’s capture, U.S. politicians are now calling for him 
to be extradited to the U.S., to face drug trafficking charges here.

U.S.
 Rep Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland 
Security, argues that extradition will help insure that Guzman remains 
behind bars, since he has twice escaped from Mexican prisons through 
bribery.

That last time Guzman escaped, he was about to be sent to the U.S.

'My
 sense in talking with Homeland Security officials and others last night
 is that we were able to penetrate his circle, get people within the 
organization to cooperate,' said McCaul. 

The noose started tightening around Guzman earlier this month.

Federal
 forces began sweeping through Culiacan, capital of the Pacific coast 
state of Sinaloa - closing streets, raiding houses, seizing automatic 
weapons, drugs and money, and arresting a series of men Mexican 
officials carefully described to reporters as top officials for Zambada.

Guzman's downfall began last week when several of his Sinaloa cartel henchmen were arrested by Mexican authorities.

On
 February 13, a man known as '19,' whom officials called the new chief 
of assassins for Ismael Zambada, one of Guzman's top henchmen, was 
arrested with two other men on the highway to the coastal resort city of
 Mazatlan.

Most wanted: Guzman is one of the most wanted men in the world and is considered the 'Osama bin Laden of the drug war'

Four days 
later, a man described as a member of the Sinaloa cartel's upper ranks 
was seized along with 4,000 hollowed-out cucumbers and bananas stuffed 
with cocaine.

In the 
middle of this week, a 43-year-old known by the nickname '20' and 
described as Zambada's chief of security, was arrested transporting more
 cocaine-stuffed produce.

By the middle of the week at least 10 Sinaloa henchmen had been seized.

A
 U.S. law enforcement official said on Saturday that at least some were 
actually security for Guzman, and authorities used them to obtain 
information that helped lead to the head of the cartel.

Agents
 learned that Guzman, 56, had started coming down from his isolated 
mountain hideouts to enjoy the comforts of Culiacan and Mazatlan, said 
Michael S. Vigil, a former senior DEA official who was briefed on the 
operation.

'That was a fatal error,' Vigil said.

Working
 on the information gleaned from Guzman's bodyguards, Mexican marines 
swarmed the house of Guzman's ex-wife but struggled to batter down the 
steel-reinforced door, according to Mexican authorities and former U.S. 
law-enforcement officials briefed on the operation.

As
 the marines forced their way in, Guzman fled through a secret door 
beneath a bathtub down a corrugated steel ladder into a network of 
tunnels and sewer canals that connect to six other houses in Culiacan, 
the officials said.

Guzman
 fled south to Mazatlan. On his heels, a team of U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents set up a base of operations with Mexican marines 
in the city, according to the current U.S. law-enforcement official.

Early
 on Saturday morning, Guzman's reign came to an end without a shot 
fired. Marines closed the beachside road in front of the Miramar 
condominiums, a 10-story, pearl-colored building with white balconies 
overlooking the Pacific and a small pool in front.

Smashing
 down the door of an austerely decorated fourth-floor condo, they seized
 the country's most-wanted man at 6:40am, a few minutes after the sun 
rose.

A neighbor who declined to identify himself for fear of retaliation said the apartment had only been occupied for two days.

An
 employee of the building's cleaning staff said that clothes were strewn
 across the floor and bed in the condo, and humble domestic appliances -
 a microwave, a floor fan, a flat-screen TV on a small table - were left
 inside.

Trapped: Marines broke into the seaside home in a complex where apartments are rented for about $1,200 a month

Photos of the 
apartment published by a local newspaper showed cheap and unglamorous 
furnishings. Inside the condo, the photos showed little food or liquor: 
just a couple of dozen eggs on a shelf. A bag from a low-end supermarket
 lay on the floor.

Mexican
 officials said that Guzman was detained along with a man they 
identified as Carlos Manuel Hoo Ramirez. It's still unclear what role 
Ramirez may have played in the cartel.

A
 U.S. law-enforcement official with direct knowledge of the killing of 
Zambada's main lieutenant in November described it as part of a 
concerted binational effort to decapitate the Sinaloa cartel.

The
 organization became the focus of U.S. and Mexican attention after a 
string of arrests and slaying of the heads of other cartels, most 
notably the seizure of brutal Zetas cartel head Miguel Angel Trevino 
Morales in July.

'Who 
are the only big fish left in the country? We can't just twiddle our 
thumbs,' said the official who was not authorized to speak to 
journalists and spoke on condition of anonymity.

'Now we focus on the biggest elephant in the room. It's by virtue of default.'

Got him: Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was arrested in an early morning raid in the resort town of Mazatlan

Guzman's
 arrest appears certain to all but quash U.S. concerns that Pena Nieto's
 administration has been reducing cooperation with U.S. law-enforcement,
 a hallmark of his predecessor Felipe Calderon's six-year term.

'This
 shows that cooperation is working, and that it's discreet and based on 
intelligence-gathering,' said Raul Benitez, a security expert at 
Mexico's National Autonomous University.

'This is, without a doubt, the most important success of Pena Nieto's administration.'

By early afternoon, Guzman was marched across the tarmac of the Mexican marines' hanger at the Mexico City airport.

The
 man who eluded Mexican authorities for more than a decade looked pudgy,
 bowed and middle-aged in a white button-down shirt and beltless black 
jeans.

Indictments: Guzman faces federal indictments in the U.S. for drug-trafficking charges

After his 2001 
escape in a laundry truck from a prison he came to control through 
bribery, Guzman was rumored to live everywhere from Argentina to 
Mexico's 'Golden Triangle,' a mountainous, marijuana-growing region 
straddling the northern states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua.

The Sinaloa Cartel grew deadlier and more powerful, taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the U.S. border.

Guzman
 was hit with multiple federal drug trafficking indictments in the U.S. 
as his drug empire stretched throughout North America and extended 
branches into Europe and Australia.

Guzman's
 play for power against local cartels caused a bloodbath in Tijuana and 
made Ciudad Juarez one of the deadliest cities in the world.

In
 2013, he was named 'Public Enemy No. 1' by the Chicago Crime 
Commission, only the second person to get that distinction after U.S. 
prohibition-era crime boss Al Capone.

Extradition: It's unclear when - or if - Guzman will be extradited to the U.S., where he faces federal charges over drug trafficking allegations

Paradise: Guzman was arrested at a hotel in the resort city of Mazatlan, Sinaloa

Number one: Guzman is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion and has been named public enemy number one by multiple law enforcement agencies

He
 appeared in only a handful of photos during his years on the run, 
staring straight into the camera of an anonymous photographer and 
defiantly brandishing an automatic rifle.

On
 Saturday, as he was walked before the press, his hands were cuffed 
behind him and a masked marine pushed down his head with a black-gloved 
hand, as if to make clear that Guzman is now under state control.

Guzman
 said nothing, and looked subdued as he reappeared before the world for a
 few seconds before disappearing into the cargo bay of a helicopter 
waiting to take him to prison.
