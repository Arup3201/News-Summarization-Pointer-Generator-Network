There are serious new tensions between Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, the most powerful figures in global football, in the lead-up to Sunday’s World Cup final.

UEFA president Platini is said to have had enough of FIFA chief Blatter continuing to snipe at European football with his latest attack a suggestion in the FIFA Weekly publication that Europe should lose two of their World Cup places to Africa and Asia.

That is the last straw for Platini, who is said to be surprised and disappointed by Blatter’s comment, which he regards as political posturing to curry favour with other confederations ahead of next year’s FIFA election when he will seek a fifth term.

Growing tensions: Michel Platini isn't impressed with Sepp Blatter's suggestion that Europe should lose two World Cup places to Africa and Asia

UEFA, who had only 13 teams in Brazil compared to 15 in France in 1998, have no intention of reducing their representation, and if anything want to add to it, such is the strength of the game across Europe.

Blatter wrote: ‘We need a new deal, preferably sooner or later. The Africans are at a severe  disadvantage and the same applies to the AFC. It cannot be that the regions are treated with such disdain.’

Yet Blatter suggested in April that there should be no change to the allocations to  protect the quality of the World Cup.

Platini returns to Brazil to watch the second semi-final in Sao Paulo with his relationship with Blatter, following their major differences at the FIFA Congress, at an all-time low. The UEFA overlord will announce whether he intends to stand against Blatter for the FIFA presidency at a press conference in Monaco on August 28, having consulted with his 54 national associations earlier that day.

Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh has now endured 50 days in prison in Dubai following a financial dispute with ex-employers GFH Capital, who sold the Championship club to Italian Massimo Cellino.

Haigh, with his bank accounts frozen and bail set at £3.7million, has no idea how long he will remain in custody. The only positive aspect is that two publishers are chasing the story of his Leeds experience and the hellish aftermath.

Hollywood mogul Ari Emanuel, the new overlord of sports management giants IMG, won no friends at Wimbledon by pettily ejecting sports business entrepreneur Andrew Croker from the company’s hospitality enclosure.

Croker, a highly popular figure in the industry and a distinguished former executive at IMG, was talking to friends and former colleagues in the IMG facility when the aggressive Emanuel ordered him out. An IMG spokesman said: ‘Andrew wasn’t invited and is a competitor, so he was asked to leave.’

FA communications operative Stuart Mawhinney is leaving to join Sky Sports as senior PR manager. Mawhinney was probably the least popular of the FA’s overladen 80-plus team in Brazil due to his enforcer role that included patrolling the England training ground in Rio to ensure the Press stayed in their designated area. His combative approach will suit Sky in their seismic battle with BT.

FA blasted over Elleray

Graham Bean, the football compliance expert, has slammed the FA for their double standards over referees’ chief David Elleray receiving only a rap over the knuckles for his appalling racist comment to black FA employee Robert McCarthy.

Bean’s Football Factors represented Northwich Victoria manager Lee Ashcroft when he received a 10-game stadium ban for a sexist remark to a female coach. The FA repeat they have closed their case against grandee Elleray, who is having diversity training while somehow keeping his positions with the FA, UEFA and FIFA. He said to McCarthy: ‘You look rather tanned, have you been down a coalmine?’

Former FA compliance chief Bean has written to FA chairman Dyke saying: ‘The FA has simply swept this matter under the carpet to look after one of its own. You are overseeing an organisation which still maintains an old boys’ network when it comes to tackling issues of this severity involving your own people.

‘It is abhorrent… This was a case which required a full and detailed investigation.’
