A man who killed himself in an Alaska jail after confessing to a numerous murders had sexually assaulted and strangled a barista the day after he abducted her, then left her body in a shed while he went on a two-week cruise and dismembered it when he returned, the FBI said Tuesday.

In the most detailed account yet of what happened to Samantha Koenig, who disappeared in February, authorities said Israel Keyes told them he strangled the 18-year-old, then left her body in a shed outside his Anchorage home until he returned from his cruise from New Orleans.

Once home, Keyes, 34, posed Koenig's body to make it appear she was still alive and took a Polaroid photo of her tied up, along with a newspaper dated February 13 - 12 days after the abduction.

Abducted: Keyes was tied to the death of Samantha 'Sammy' Koenig, a barista who vanished in February from her coffee stand workplace

Dead: Israel Keyes, 34, who was liked to the murders of Samantha Koenig and numerous others across the country, was found dead in his jail cell on Sunday morning in an apparent suicide

He later typed a ransom note demanding $30,000 from Koenig's family on the back of a photocopy of the photo, sending a text message from the woman's cellphone with directions to the note.

Keyes dismembered Koenig's body and disposed of the remains in a frozen lake north of Anchorage after he cut a hole in the ice, the FBI said in a release.

Also on Tuesday, authorities released 
chilling video footage of Keyes abducting Koenig, caught by surveillance
cameras in and outside the coffee shop.

Keyes, 34, was arrested in Koenig's death in March in Texas, after using her stolen debit cards at ATMs there and in Alaska, Arizona and New Mexico.

After his arrest, Keyes confessed to killing Koenig and at least seven other people across the country over the past decade.

His other known victims were Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vermont, who disappeared in June 2011.

He told police he broke into their home, went into their bedroom, bound them with zip ties and forced them into their car.

He then drove them to an abandoned house and tied Bill to a stool in the basement, while Lorraine Currier tried to escape, Chittenden County state's attorney T.J. Donovan said on Monday.

Discovering this, Keyes ran out and tackled Lorraine, and Bill then tried to escape.

He shot Bill 
Currier with the gun he had stolen from the couple's home, and then 
sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier, Donovan said, his 
voice breaking.

Their bodies have never been found, and Keyes did not volunteer the information.

'They fought to the end,' Donovan said, adding that they showed 'extraordinary bravery and love for each other.'

Keyes told authorities he also sexually assaulted and strangled Lorraine Currier. The couple's bodies have not been found.

Tristram Coffin, U.S. Attorney in Vermont, said during a news conference on Monday: 'He provided some motivation, but I don't think it's really [possible] to pigeonhole why he did this.'

Mr Coffin added: 
'It was something that he could control and he liked to do it. Why 
someone likes to act like that, nobody knows.'

Keyes confessed to other killings without identifying the victims or saying where their remains were, other than that four were killed in Washington state and one in New York.

Keyes, who faced a March trial in Koenig's death, was found dead in his Anchorage jail cell Sunday after he apparently killed himself.

Authorities wouldn't say how he killed himself, only that he was alone in his cell. An autopsy will be conducted.

Final hours: Samantha can be seen working at the coffee shop in this security video as her killer (seen lower left) approaches

Panic: After handing him the drink he ordered, Samantha is seen putting her hands up several times before Keyes orders her to shut off the lights in the shop

Last seen: Keyes is seen leading his victim through the parking lot. He told police that he sexually assaulted and strangled her the next day

Stolen: After killing Koenig, police said that Keyes used her phone to fake text messages from her and conceal the abduction

In the video, Keyes can be seen approaching the window of the Anchorage coffee kiosk. He then orders an Americano coffee, which Samantha makes.

But after handing him the drink, she is seen putting her hands up several times before Keyes orders her to shut off the lights and uses zip ties to bind her hands behind her back.

He then climbs in through the window and leads her out. The two can be seen walking in the parking lot to his vehicle.

Keyes told Samantha that he would let her go if her family paid a ransom, but that was never his intention, police said.

'He knew all along he was going to kill her,' Anchorage homicide Detective Monique Doll said.

Koenig's body was recovered from the lake in April.

Another video released Tuesday shows a man identified as Keyes getting out of a white truck parked in nearby parking lot just before the abduction took place, and returning with another person he appeared to gripping tightly.

Police said Tuesday a license plate, green toolboxes and a ladder rack had been removed from the pickup truck before the abduction, then reinstalled afterward so Keyes could disguise the vehicle, which had an extended bed.

In their investigation, the vehicle appeared twice in a list of 750 local white trucks of the same kind, but police scratched it off the list of possibilities because it looked so different.

Authorities say Keyes traveled extensively in the U.S., landing at one location and targeting victims randomly hundreds of miles away.

In the Koenig case, he stuck to his own town.

'He broke his own rule,' Doll said.

Samantha's family said that despite the proximity, there was no apparent previous connection between the teen and the suspect.

Reached by phone on Sunday, Samantha's father, James Koenig declined to comment on Keyes' death.
