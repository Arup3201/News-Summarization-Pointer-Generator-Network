A terminally ill father managed to fulfil the last of his dying wishes just four days before he died.

Ryan Graham, 32, got married, spent Father’s Day with his step-children, and then celebrated his step-daughter’s birthday.

The pig farmer from Needham Market, Suffolk, was told in February that he had just months to live after being diagnosed with aggressive stomach cancer.

Ryan Graham, 32, was diagnosed with aggressive stomach cancer in February. Before he died, he wanted to marry his partner, Amy, spend Father's Day with his step-children, Shellie, 11, and Ryan, 8, and to attend Shellie's birthday party in August

He refused to let the illness beat his desire to marry his partner, Amy, and to spend Father’s Day with his step-children Shellie, 11, and Ryan, eight.

In August, doctors warned him that he wouldn’t make it to Shellie’s birthday and said the party should be brought forward.

But incredibly, despite having been bed-bound for four weeks, Mr Graham got to his feet to see Shellie, 11, blow out her candles on August 16.

He passed away peacefully four days later.

Mrs Graham said: ‘Ryan was amazing - the most wonderful partner and father to my children.

‘When we found out the cancer was terminal it was devastating, but Ryan was determined to die on his own terms.

Doctor's told Mr Graham (pictured with his wife, Amy, and step-children Ryan and Shellie on Shellie's birthday) that he would not live until Shellie's birthday but he did and he even managed to get out of bed to celebrate with her. He died just four days later

Mr Graham (pictured on his birthday) proposed to his girlfriend, Amy, a month after he was told his cancer was terminal

‘He did everything that he wanted, reaching every milestone he set out to, and then peacefully passed away.

‘Getting to Shellie’s birthday was really difficult - the doctors wanted us to bring it forward, and he hadn’t even been out of bed for four weeks - but he managed to come downstairs and watch her blow out the candles.

‘He was very ill, but he always had a smile on his face.’

Mr Graham’s first wish was realised in May when he married Amy.

Mrs Graham (pictured with Ryan and her children on her wedding day) said: 'It was the most amazing day. There wasn't a dry eye in the house, it couldn't have been more perfect'

She said: ‘Ryan and I met in March 2012 through a mutual friend and instantly hit it off.

‘He was a wonderful partner and he formed a bond with my children that I never expected.

‘He’d always wanted to be a dad and I loved that he was so close to the kids. When he was diagnosed with the cancer he told me he’d leave if that’s what I wanted.

‘He didn’t want me to be a widow, but he was the one for me. It never even crossed my mind to leave him.

Mrs Graham said: 'Ryan (pictured at work before his illness) was amazing - the most wonderful partner and father to my children. When we found out the cancer was terminal it was devastating, but Ryan was determined to die on his own terms'

‘He proposed to me just a month after we were told it was terminal.

‘I was just making a cup of tea in the kitchen, and I turned around to see Ryan down on one knee, holding a Haribo ring his hand.

‘It was so simple, but it was perfect.’

The pair planned their white wedding in the space of just six weeks.

Before he died, Mr Graham made memory boxes for each of the children as a way of showing them how much they meant to him

Mrs Graham said: ‘It was a bit crazy planning the wedding so quickly.

‘When we found a venue and asked the manager if they had a day available in May or June, he immediately flipped his calendar to 2014.

‘I think he was a bit shocked that we wanted to get married so soon, but luckily there was a date free. After that everything else just fell into place.

‘Just three days before the wedding he’d been admitted to hospital, so it was a bit scary, but I always knew he’d be there.

Mrs Graham (pictured with Ryan on Valentine's Day) said: 'He did everything that he wanted, reaching every milestone he set out to, and then peacefully passed away'

‘It was the most amazing day. There wasn’t a dry eye in the house, it couldn’t have been more perfect.’

Mr Graham’s next dream was to spend Father’s Day with his step-children.

His wife said: ‘Ryan was a wonderful second dad to the kids.

‘He was known as big Ryan and my son was little Ryan. They did everything together, so we really wanted to make Father’s Day special - it was the only one he’d have with them.

Mrs Graham said: 'Ryan was a wonderful second dad to the kids. He was known as big Ryan and my son was little Ryan. They did everything together, so we really wanted to make Father's Day special - it was the only one he'd have with them'

‘The children got him lots of presents, but he wanted to do something special for them too, so he put together some memory boxes for them.

‘He filled them with memories of their favourite holidays and moments together. He just wanted them to know how much they meant to him.’

Mr Graham’s final wish was to celebrate Shellie’s eleventh birthday in August and by that time he was in and out of hospital, and had spent four weeks in bed.

Mrs Graham said: ‘The doctors had warned us that we should bring Shellie’s birthday forward, but Ryan was quite determined to make it to the proper day.

Mrs Graham said: 'Ryan (pictured with the children on Father's Day) fought this horrible disease until the end. He will forever be remembered as a brave, loving man, and I feel lucky to have known him'

‘Ryan had been bed bound for a while, but when it came to Shellie blowing out her candles at her party, she wanted Ryan to be there.

‘I don’t know how he managed it, but he made his way downstairs, and sung happy birthday with everyone else.

‘I couldn’t believe he found the strength to do it, but it was incredible.

‘When we helped him back upstairs after the party he looked at me and told me he was tired. It’s only now that I realise what he meant.’

Over the next four days, Mr Graham’s condition worsened. Family and friends came to say their goodbyes and on August 20 he died surrounded by his loved ones.

Mrs Graham said: ‘Ryan fought this horrible disease until the end. He will forever be remembered as a brave, loving man, and I feel lucky to have known him.

‘We’ll continue to remember him by raising money for the St Elizabeth Hospice in Ipswich who looked after Ryan so well.

‘Every Father’s Day, birthday, and Christmas, we’ll donate money as a way to remember him.

‘Life is very different now, it’s been tough without Ryan, but he will never be forgotten.’

A spokesman for St Elizabeth Hospice said: ‘St Elizabeth Hospice cared for Ryan at his home and at our hospice in Ipswich. We were also able to provide support for his family.

‘We are pleased we were able to help Ryan, Amy and their family during these tough times.

‘We are extremely grateful for the support his family and friends have shown by raising money in his name for his St Elizabeth Tribute Fund.’

Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, occurs when a tumour develops inside the stomach.

The initial symptoms are vague so are often mistaken for other conditions.

They include indigestion, stomach ache, nausea and feeling very full after meals.

Symptoms of advanced stomach cancer include blood in the stools, loss of appetite and weight loss.

Stomach cancer is most common in people who are over 60, male, white and eat an unhealthy diet low in fruit and vegetables.

Treatment usually involves surgery to remove some or all of the stomach and chemotherapy.

The cancer is relatively uncommon and about 6,000 people are diagnosed in the UK each year.
