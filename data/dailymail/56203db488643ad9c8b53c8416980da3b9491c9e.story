Viewers were left outraged last night after Channel 4 screened a brutally graphic public execution in the season finale of hit-show Homeland.

The controversial scene saw the terrorist drama's ratings plummet to an all-time low, as fans also attacked the decision to kill of anti-hero Nicholas Brody.

Half-way through the hour-long episode, Brody, played by Damian Lewis, has a noose tied around his neck before being spat on then lifted up by a crane.

Outrage: Viewers and critics branded Homeland 'brutal' and 'offensive' as Brody was publicly hanged

Pregnant love interest Carrie is beaten off the fence by guards with batons as she tries to call a final goodbye

TV audiences around the world watched Lewis' character shake and contort as the camera stayed on his face while baiting crowds scream, chant, and bang on cars.

And Brody's pregnant love interest Carrie, played by Claire Danes, is beaten off a fence with a baton when she tries to shout a final goodbye.

The pair were on a mission to Iran, heading for Saul's safe house, when they were apprehended by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and Brody's demise ensues.

The controversial scene was one of a few that the production company filmed in Morocco rather than Israel amid fears it would not be safe so close to Syria as the US considers a strike on the Middle East nation.

Disgusted viewers took to Twitter in rage, and critics blasted the episode as 'offensive', saying the show's creators should end the production.

The New Yorker branded it 'unfulfilling, anticlimactic, and in some ways offensive'.

The
 Telegraph gave the episode, and Brody's 'gut-wrenching death', two 
stars - calling on creators of the terrorist thriller to call it a day.

Sunday night's episode attracted just 1.75 million viewers - well down on the 2.8 million who watched the finale of the first series and 2.1 million who tuned in for the end of series two.

The Channel 4 thriller won only a 7.2 per cent share of the TV audience with nearly twice as many viewers - 3.1 million - watching BBC 2's choral competition, The Choir Christmas Final.

A repeat of classic animated film The Snowman on Channel 4 earlier in the evening also usurped the terrorist thriller with 1.96 million viewers.

One person tweeted: 'Homeland. Brutal. I'm drained.'

Another wrote: '#homeland brutal scenes not really full of festive good cheer!'

One woman said: 'Homeland is so brutal, ffs it makes me so angry and upset'

While another commented: 'Homeland season 3 finale was brutal. Actually a bit stunned...'

'What the hell??? How disgusting is that scene in Homeland,' another person said.

One person said: 'Ashamed to say I watched the Homeland Season 3 Finale tonight. Hanging scene made me want to shoot my TV.'

Addressing the horrific scene, Damian Lewis revealed it was 'terrifying' and 'unsettling' to film.

Speaking
 to the New York Times, he said: It was terrifying, actually. I had 
tried hard not to engage too much with the idea of staging my own 
execution.

'But certainly 
as we got there and saw the crane in front of the square, they had hired
 about 200 local extras and they were chanting and banging the car as I 
came through the crowds.

'Looking at the crowd, cheering and baying for your blood, all around you, it was very unsettling.'

He added that co-star Claire Danes refused to look at the brutal scene until it was absolutely necessary.

Showrunner Alex Gansa also described the 'mob' feeling as 400 extras yelled during filming in the middle of the night in Rabat.

Viewers also blasted the show for screening the horrific scene half-way through the episode, before ending on 'an anti-climax'.

After Brody's death, Carrie decides she will have to put the child up for adoption, unable to function alone, and the rest of the episode focuses on her taking over the Iran operation.

One person tweeted: 'What exactly is left for another season?'

Journalist
 Mehdi Hasan said: 'A deeply disappointing and anti-climactic finale to 
#homeland season 3. Anways, RIP and all that...'

Another person tweeted: 'Sorry #Homeland I'm, done. You killed the character I was sticking around for. I'm OUT.'

Producers insist that the 'shelf life had expired' for Lewis's character, US Marine turned terrorist Sgt Nicholas Brody.

But
 many of those who did tune in were left fuming about the anti-hero's 
death - and vowed not to watch the planned fourth series of the show.

Former
 X Factor host Kate Thornton was among the critics after CIA secret 
agent Brody was dramatically captured and hanged in a public execution 
in Iran.

She tweeted: 'You can't kill Brody. Homeland without Brody is like Santa without the beard. Wrong.'

Similarly,
 Andrew Johnston tweeted: 'Homeland without Brody, that's like fish 
without chips, England without rain - just won't work.'

The
 third season of the show had already sparked a storm of complaints from
 fans over dull and confusing plotlines with ratings slumping from the 
2.2 million who saw the opening episode.

After a bombing at the CIA's Langley 
HQ, Brody fled the country, became a heroin addict while held in a 
half-abandoned skyscraper in Venezuela and barely featured until the 
last few episodes.

His former lover Carrie, meanwhile, was forcibly detained in a psychiatric unit and discovered she was carrying Brody's baby.

After the public execution of Brody, Carrie no longer feels she can be a good mother to his child, which, to her family's horror, she wants to give up for adoption

Fans complained about a lengthy sub-plot featuring Brody's depressed daughter Dana - while he was nowhere to be seen.

Producers were forced to defend their decision to include Brody's family prominently - while leaving viewers in the dark about the fate of Brody himself.

Gansa said: 'There are all these families that are the victims of somebody in the family doing an act of violence.

'Whether it's Sandy Hook, whether it's Columbine, the Boston Marathon bombers, these people all have families who suffer the consequences of these psychopathic actions.

'It was interesting to think about what would happen to the Brody family.'

A Channel 4 spokeswoman said that episodes of series 3 averaged an audience of 3.1 million in total with many viewers watching it on Channel 4's online 'catch up' service 4oD.

In the U.S. the Homeland finale was watched by 2.9 million people a week ago Sunday, a record for the show.
