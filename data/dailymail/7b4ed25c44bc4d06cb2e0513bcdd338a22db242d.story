Attack: Detective Paul Whiteley, 51, told a holidaymaker: 'I'm a copper, I can do what I want' as he attacked him in a pub after drinking for seven hours

A murder squad detective’s career lies in tatters today after he was convicted of a shocking attack on a holidaymaker in a pub while shirtless and completely 'legless'.

Detective sergeant Paul Whiteley, 51, of West Yorkshire Police’s Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, is set to lose his job after saying: 'I'm a copper, I'll do what I like' before drunkenly assaulting another customer at Fylingdales Inn in Whitby, North Yorkshire. 

The 51-year-old told the mother of an autistic child to 'f*** your f***ing disabled child' during the outburst which could end his 22-year career.

Witnesses described how Whiteley ripped off his shirt during the argument before shouting: 'Come on outside you bald-head b*****d'.

He was staying at a campsite and had been drinking for seven hours with his girlfriend, Claire Hughes, 43.

Scarborough Magistrates' Court heard electrician Carl Sarsfield, 41, was asked to have a word with the couple when a barmaid spotted them heading for their car, still carrying open bottles of wine. 

He said: 'I went out there and asked him politely "You are not drinking and driving are you?"'

He claimed Whiteley, who was getting in the passenger side, replied; 'I’m not driving - she is.'

The electrician objected, saying: 'She is legless as well.' 

Mr Sarsfield said Whiteley and his partner then came back into the pub to wait for a taxi, but things became 'heated'.

Whiteley slapped him in the face, prompting Mr Sarsfield to defend himself, leaving the police officer on his back.

He said: 'He was absolutely legless. He could hardly stand up. He was falling all over the place. 

'I could have burped on him and he would have fallen over.'

He then ripped his shirt off after the slap and slung it towards the bar before shouting 'Come on then - outside you bald headed b*****d.'

Miss Sarsfield, who was with her autistic daughter at the time, to,d the court: 'He was shouting "I’m a copper - I will do what I like". He was paralytic. My initial reaction was to get my daughter away from what was going on. I told them to calm down and there was no need to behave in that way.'

The full-time carer said: 'My daughter was hysterical. I saw Carl and the man fighting. The man was very drunk and fell over.'

The court heard police were called and Whiteley told the people in the pub: 'Let them come. I’m a police officer. I will sort it out.'

Miss Crossley said as they waited for police to arrive Whiteley shouted abuse about her daughter.

She added: 'My daughter was absolutely beside herself. It affected her for weeks afterwards.'

Reputation: The decorated officer who has served with West Yorkshire Police for 22 years was 'so drunk he could hardly stand up and kept falling over'

Partner: Whiteley had been drinking with his girlfriend Claire Hughes, 43, for seven hours. A customer interfered when he spotted the pair walking to their car with open bottles of wine

Mark Kelly, defending Whiteley, told the court how the conviction 'will be simply catastrophic for him, in terms of his reputation built up over many years, employment and any future prospects.'

Fining Whiteley £1,455 in court costs, Magistrate Delia Liddle said: 'The level of fine is more serious, having being committed on licensed premises and you were in drink.'  

The court heard Whiteley was arrested and bundled in a police van after the incident around 9.30pm in May last year.

Martin Hawes, prosecuting, described both attacks as 'unprovoked' and denied Whiteley was acting in self-defence.

Miss Hughes was charged with assaulting Miss Crossley but she was found not guilty.

During the drunken row at the Fylingdales Inn in Whitby, North Yorkshire, he threatened another customer, saying: 'Come on then - outside you bald headed b*****d'

Whiteley, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was found guilty of assault by beating after four hours of deliberations. 

He denied the charge throughout and speaking after the case, his barrister confirmed his client intends to appeal.

Whiteley had been suspended for the force for the 14 months that the case has been waiting to come to trial.

Detective
 Chief Superintendent Clive Wain, of West Yorkshire Police's 
Professional Standards Department, said: 'We are aware of the decision 
of the court in relation to this officer. West Yorkshire Police expects 
the very highest standards of its officers and staff, both on and off 
duty. 

'The officer remains suspended from duty and an internal misconduct investigation will now commence.'
