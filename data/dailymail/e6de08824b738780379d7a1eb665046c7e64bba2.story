The owner of one of Britain's oldest family-run market stalls has finally closed his market stall after 163 years of business.

Located in Sheffield, N Smith and Sons, has sold handbags and purses to hundreds of thousands of customers since its opening in 1851 and has been run by more than seven generations of the same family.

Now known as Smiths, it had been passed down from father to son with the latest owner being Paul Smith.

When Smiths originally opened way back in 1851, business was booming. However, after customers dwindled to just nine a day, Paul says the family have struggled to meet even the service charge.

Paul says that his small family stall hasn't been able to compete with nearby supermarkets, shopping centres and online shops that offer the same stock for a much cheaper price.

Paul, 52, says that the way we shop has completely changed since the stall opened and unfortunately Smiths couldn't keep up.

'There is too much competition. Everything we sell is now on the high street or in a supermarket, when years ago there wasn't anything like that.' Paul said, explaining that it wasn't just Smiths that was suffering.

'Markets have been going downhill for years - we just can’t compete with the big retailers any more. When it comes to offering a bargain, stall holders aren't even in the same league.

'And when it comes to quality, people can pick up good bargains online these days or they can head to an out-of-town retail park - which will offer free parking right outside the shop you want.

'Why would you put yourself through the hassle of driving to the city centre, paying extortionate parking fees and then looking round the market? We’ve just had to accept that things have changed - and we’re getting out now.'

For Paul the closing of the stall isn't just a financial loss, but a sentimental one too. He grew up in the hustle and bustle of Castle Market, taking over from his dad Gerard 30 years ago.

Paul even met his wife Vicky, also 52, at the stall when she was employed by his parents - she continued to work there for 36 years. 

Vicky agrees that their small stall has no chance of competing with the multi-million pound brands that offer the same stock.

'Retail has changed. There used to be customers four or five deep, it was buzzing and there was a lot of camaraderie,' says the 52-year-old. 'But
 back then there was no Tesco or anything, the market was all there was.
 Now there is too much retail and everybody is taking a little bit.'

Paul admits that the business has been sinking for a long time and says that he has already spent too much trying to keep the stall afloat.

For Vicky the closure of the shop will be deeply personal - she's worked there for 36 years and met her husband there when she was employed by his parents at the age of 16

'It’s sad to say, but I’ve thrown away as much money as I can for sentimental reasons and now we’ve got to accept the way it is.'

They say business has struggled since the market was moved to the new Moor Market site in Sheffield.

'We said we would give the new market a try - but the reason we 
think it hasn’t worked is there's no real demand for markets now,' says Paul.

He added that smaller towns may still have a need for a market but he wouldn't be surprised if they disappeared in urban areas altogether.

'It might not be the case in more rural areas, where people rely on a
 market, but in large cities markets could soon be a thing of the past.'

Sheffield Council said it is looking at changing opening hours so as many people as possible can shop there.

Leigh Bramall, council cabinet member for business, said three new 
traders had joined the market and three more had doubled the size of 
their stalls.

Leigh added that the council would not give up on their local traders, 'We will continue to support all traders and help them promote their businesses to the people of Sheffield.'

Smiths will close for the final time on Saturday, June 28. The family said it would be a sad day, and thanked customers.

Smiths will close for good on Saturday 28th June
