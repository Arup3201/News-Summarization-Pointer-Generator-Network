Football stars Gary and Phil Neville were said to be in a state of shock last night after their father was arrested over allegations of indecent assault.

Neville Neville, 63, was detained in the early hours of Saturday morning after a distressed woman phoned police following an alleged incident.

The football agent is understood to have gone out on Friday night and enjoyed drinks with friends at a pub. At the end of the evening a woman allegedly offered him a lift home in her car.

But she claims that as she was driving him back to his home he sexually assaulted her.

Neville was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault before being bailed pending further inquiries.

Last night there was no answer at the 
£650,000 mock-Tudor house he shares with his wife Jill, 61, in North 
Manor, Bury. Neighbours refused to comment.

Neville’s son, Gary, 38, a former 
Manchester United and England star, is now Sky Sports’ main football 
pundit. Phil Neville, 36, still plays for Everton and used to play for 
England. His twin sister Tracey was an England netball player.

A football source said: ‘Gary and Phil are absolutely stunned by this thunderbolt.

‘Their stable family life has been the
rock on which they built their successful careers so this allegation 
comes totally out of the blue. It would be safe to say they are in deep 
shock. Neville and his wife are an incredibly close couple and appear to
have the perfect marriage.’

He played cricket for Greenmount 
Cricket Club in the Bolton Cricket League during the 1980s before 
becoming the high-profile director of Bury football club.

Neville inspired and mentored his two sons and acts as their agent, representing both during contract talks with their clubs.

His unusual name achieved a cult 
status among football fans as ‘one of the best chants in football’. It 
is chanted on the football terraces to the tune of David Bowie’s hit 
Rebel Rebel.

He also has a reputation as the life 
and soul of the party, not least because of reports of his raucous 
partying with the wives and girlfriends of the England footballers 
players during the 2006 World Cup in Germany.

Neville was said to have stood on a 
couch at a restaurant and bar and proceeded to lead the WAGs in singing 
the national anthem and smashing their champagne glasses.

Yesterday Greater Manchester Police 
said: ‘Police are investigating a sexual assault which happened in the 
early hours of Saturday, 23 March 2013 in the North Manor area of Bury. A
63-year-old man from Bury was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault
and has been bailed till May pending further inquiries.’
