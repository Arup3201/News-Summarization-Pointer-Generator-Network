An amateur footballer who suffered shocking facial injuries when he was beaten by thugs has achieved his dream of becoming a model.

Richie Robins, 21, courageously intervened when he saw the woman - who he did not know - cornered by six thugs outside a nightclub.

The sport development student was punched to the ground and his attackers continued the assault in Colchester, Essex, while he lay bleeding.

Mr Robins was left with horrific facial injuries including a broken nose, cheek and eye socket after the attack last December.

He had been approached by a modelling agency a week before the assault and feared his dreams of a career on the catwalk were over.

But thanks to facial reconstructive surgery on the NHS, his smile and looks have been restored. And two weeks ago the student made his catwalk debut at a show in Mayfair, London.

Mr Robins - a 6ft 2in goalkeeper for non-league team Wivenhoe Town FC - still suffers nightmares from the attack, and said the modelling has been a ‘massive confidence boost’.

The student, who is 
studying at the University of East London, added: ‘I was not drinking as
 I had football in the morning so I saw things more clearly.

‘They
 had cornered the girl inside the club and then they did it again 
outside. They pushed her up against the wall so I had to step in. I was 
in total agony after the attack.

'I
 was devastated when I saw my face. For the first three months the 
nerves in my face were so damaged any quick kind of movement felt like 
I’d got a bag of Lego bricks in my face all jumbling around.

‘I
 still don’t think I look quite right. I hope the swelling will go down 
as I can notice it. I had written modelling off so it was a massive 
confidence boost to walk down the catwalk.’

Mr Robins was set upon outside a nightclub in Colchester on December 21 after going to support his friend’s new event. 

He spent Christmas in hospital - eating his roast dinner through a straw – and then a further four months in and out of hospital.

Surgeons at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford fixed his broken nose and spent two hours carefully inserting a metal plate into his left cheek.

Mr Robins, who still has swelling on his left side, was stunned when he was scouted for the catwalk and told the scars on his nose and forehead wouldn’t hold him back.

Michelle Court, founder of creative agency Court On Camera who headhunted him, said: ‘When I saw him I just thought he has amazing cheekbones.

‘He had confidence and is beautiful looking. The best thing about Richie is he is so modest.’

Richie Robins

Mr Robins was a goalkeeper for Wivenhoe Town, who play in the Thurlow Nunn Eastern Counties Football League Premier Division - five divisions below the professional Football League.

He has played 12 times this season for the side - winning twice, drawing once and losing nine times - although his last appearance was on December 14, seven days before the attack.

Mr Robins was also a youth player with Colchester United, and was offered the chance to train with Premier League West Ham United.

Essex Police are still investigating the attack which took place outside a Subway store, and two men are on bail until May 8. Mr Robins had been at his friend’s event at The Silk Road Lounge.
