A boy who was left brain damaged by blundering midwives has been awarded £7.1million in damages after his mother’s 14-year fight against the hospital responsible.

Clare Scott’s son Charlie has a serious form of cerebral palsy and cannot walk, talk, sit up or drink without assistance. He will need care for the rest of his life.

It is believed that when he was born, the umbilical cord was wrapped around his shoulders for more than 20 minutes in the womb before midwives noticed.

Compensation: Charlie cannot cannot walk, talk or drink without assistance and will need care for the rest of his life

If the problem had been spotted, Mrs 
Scott could have been given an emergency Caesarean section.

As it was, 
Charlie was starved of oxygen and it was 55 minutes before he was able 
to breathe on his own.

He was diagnosed with spastic quadriplegic 
hemiplegic athetoid cerebral palsy at six months old.

Mother-of-five Mrs Scott, 36, launched legal proceedings against the 
Royal Bournemouth Hospital Trust in Dorset before Charlie’s first 
birthday. The Trust spent 12 years denying clinical negligence, 
resulting in a protracted legal dispute.

But two years ago, the Trust admitted that Charlie’s brain injury would 
have been avoided if Mrs Scott had been cared for properly during 
labour.

Since then, lawyers have been negotiating compensation which has
now been settled in court. The £7.1million will be given in annual 
instalments to help Charlie, now 14, for the rest of his life.

Mrs Scott, from Bournemouth, plans to use some of the money now to buy him specialist equipment and to ensure he has adequate lifetime care.

She said: 'No amount of compensation makes up for the disability, but it's security.

'It makes me feel better to know that when I can't look after him anymore I will be able to put something else in place.

'I felt angry against the hospital. If they had done their job properly we would have normal and healthy child.

'I was mortified to think that through no fault of my own that my son had cerebral palsy.

'Medical experts have spent the last 14 years trying to establish what happened and what went wrong.

'In the end the hospital trust admitted liability but only because I refused to back down.

'They should have admitted it a lot sooner because they had been in the wrong and not have me battling this for most of my adult life.'

Mrs Scott had a normal and healthy pregnancy until she went to the Royal Bournemouth Hospital in 1998 after going into labour.

Charlie's mother said of the money awarded: 'No amount of compensation makes up for the disability, but it's security'

She said: 'When Charlie was born I knew something was wrong. He was white, the colour of a piece of paper and all his extremities were blue; his lips, fingernails, everything.

'It was 55 minutes before he breathed on his own, it all kind of happened in slow motion.

'If they had transferred to Poole hospital for specialist treatment the odds are it never would have happened.

'They had procedures in place for emergencies but basically none of it ever happened.

'We decided to take action against the hospital when Charlie was nine-months-old because I knew that something had happened to make him disabled.

'I adore Charlie but life is very hard, he needs constant care and attention, so I did it because I want him to be looked after in the future.

'Social services have been brilliant, however every time we need something we have to be assessed and it's so drawn out.

'We never really discussed how much we might get because nobody really knew, but I wanted to be able to say 'Charlie needs a new wheelchair, let's go and get him one'.

'It was a really weird feeling, it was just so strange to know that after all that time and all the fighting and the appointments with medics, experts, and consultants, that that was it.

'My message to others would be don't give up, no matter how hard it gets.'

Mrs Scott has four other sons; Spencer, 12, Harrison, seven, and Austin and Willis, both six, who Charlie enjoys playing with.

Paula Shobbrook, director of nursing and midwifery at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, said: 'We apologise sincerely to Charles and his family for his injuries.'
