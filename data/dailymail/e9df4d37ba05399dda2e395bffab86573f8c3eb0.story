France head to Brazil with plenty of confidence after rounding off their World Cup warm-up matches by thrashing Jamaica 8-0 on Sunday, with striker Karim Benzema scoring two and creating two in an impressive display of attacking football.

Benzema picked out Oliver Giroud for France's fourth goal and also created the second for midfielder Blaise Matuidi, who in turn set up Benzema's second.

Star winger Franck Ribery was ruled out of the World Cup on Friday because of a lingering back injury but his absence could work in France's favor as the teamwork looks much improved.

In form: PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi was superb for France, scoring their second from just outside the box

'We've lost
 a world-class player,' France coach Didier Deschamps said. 'He's not 
here, but we have other players. It's about having collective strength.'

Giroud
 set up the opener for midfielder Yohan Cabaye, left back Patrice Evra 
crossed for Matuidi's second of the night, and Antoine Griezmann came 
off the bench to score two clinical goals.

'It's
 not easy to score eight goals. It's good for confidence, although we 
won't be over-confident,' Deschamps said. 'We played with a lot of 
mobility, and there was a good understanding between the players.'

Less
 than a year ago, Benzema was fighting for his place after a dismal run 
of 15 games without a goal, but has scored six in his past six and his 
international tally has improved to a respectable 21 in 66.

This was France's heaviest win since a 10-0 thrashing of Azerbaijan in 1995.

Deadly: Benzema scored both his goals from the corner of the box cutting in from the left hand side

Without
 Ribery, Deschamps will likely play with Benzema in a roaming role and 
Giroud at center forward against Honduras in their Group E match on 
Sunday. The French then play Switzerland and Ecuador.

'Karim and Olivier are both in great shape,' Deschamps said.

France created early pressure, and Giroud went close to heading in Mathieu Valbuena's teasing cross from the left.

The defense remains vulnerable to set pieces, however, and defender Adrian Mariappa almost gave the visitors a surprise lead.

France took the lead in the 17th minute with a well-worked team goal.

Valbuena
 found space on the edge of the penalty area, looped the ball up to 
Giroud, who held off a defender before nodding the ball down to Cabaye. 
Sprinting into space, the PSG midfielder expertly controlled the ball on
 his chest before volleying home as he he slid along the ground.

In control: Olivier Giroud linked well with Benzema, eventually converting a cross to make it four

All together: France showed plenty of quality along with a team spirit which has been missing in the past

The
 second goal came just three minutes later, as Benzema picked out 
Matuidi, and the PSG midfielder smacked the ball inside the left post 
from 20 meters.

Benzema
 got his first in the 38th, playing a quick one-two with Valbuena on the
 edge of the box, before cutting inside his marker and curling the ball 
inside the right post.

Benzema
 showed his passing is just as good when, in the 53rd, he peeled away 
down the left flank and picked out Giroud with a tight, curling pass and
 the Arsenal forward finished with a powerful shot into the left corner 
for his third goal in three games.

Benzema
 got his second in the 63rd with another emphatic finish, collecting 
Matuidi's clever reverse pass and hitting an unstoppable shot into the 
top left corner.

Three
 minutes later, Matuidi showed his finishing skills when he ran onto 
Evra's cross and clipped the ball past goalkeeper Jacomeno Barrett.

Little master: Mathieu Valbuena was was excellent for France as part of a dangerous attacking trio

With
 20 minutes left, Benzema went close to his hat trick with a thudding 
strike against the post, and Valbuena miscued from close range moments 
later.

After
 Jamaica lost possession in midfield, Valbuena passed to Benzema, who 
returned the pass only for Valbuena to lose his balance as he tried to 
control the ball. Griezmann was on hand to collect it, swivel and finish
 neatly in the 77th.

His next goal, a back-heel flick in the 89th, was even better, rounding off the perfect send-off for France in front of their fans.
