A hotel owner in Skegness has been barred from selling a high-end Italian beer because the Linconshire town is said to be too downmarket for the brand.

Bosses behind Peroni Nastro Azzuro intervened when Derek Bain, owner of Crown Hotel, wanted to install a draught tap in his bar.

The taste of Northern Italy will not be on tap in Skegness after brand inspectors visited the resort

The Linconshire town is home to Britain's first ever toursit camp- Butlins. It's beach is popular amongst tourists

The three-star Crown Hotel will not be serving Peroni, according to management

Brand inspectors were sent to the seaside town's three-star hotel to assess its menu and clientèle.They denied Mr Bain, 32, permission to sell their Northern Italian lager.

He said: 'They walked around with a clipboard and turned their noses up. 

'They are saying Skegness isn’t good enough for Peroni

'And the people up here aren’t the people they like to associate with their brand. It’s obscene.'

Mr Bain's £85-a-night hotel is next door to £1million homes and a top golf course.

But inspectors decided it wasn't good enough to stock the £5-a-pint lager.

Mr Bain said he is not the only publican in Skegness that has been turned down by the owners of the Rome-based lager.

At least two other pubs in the Linconshire town — home to Britain’s first ever Butlin’s holiday camp — have been rejected.

Peroni
ad campaigns show glamorous Italian women living 'la dolce vita', 
drinking the beer on luxury yachts. The brand describes the beer as an 
'international Italian icon'.

A spokesperson for owner Miller Brands said: 'we assess them on the basis of outlet and consumers as to whether or not our brands are right for there.'

Peroni are known for their stylish branding and advertising campaigns. Skegness residents will be able to buy bottles of the beer, but will not drink it from the tap at the Crown Hotel

Peroni bosses said they felt Skegness did not fit well with their brand of beer which celebrates 'la dolce vita'- the sweet life
