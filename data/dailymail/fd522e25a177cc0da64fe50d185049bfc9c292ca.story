A civil servant who made offensive alterations to Wikipedia pages on the Hillsborough disaster using Government computers has been sacked.

The 24-year-old used the secure intranet to change the phrase 'You'll never walk alone' - the anthem of Liverpool FC - to 'You'll never walk again'.

It was one of a slew of tweaks that began to emerge on the 20th anniversary of the April 1989 tragedy which saw 96 fans crushed.

Offensive: A 24-year-old junior administrator, based in Liverpool, has been fired for using Government computers to make offensive tweaks to Wikipedia entries about the Hillsborough disaster, which killed 96

He changed the phrase 'You'll never walk alone', the anthem of Liverpool FC, to 'You'll never walk again'

Today, announcing the sacking to MPs, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude wrote: 'The Government has treated this matter with the utmost seriousness.

'Our position from the very start has been that the amendments made to Wikipedia are sickening.

'The behaviour is in complete contravention of the Civil Service Code, and every canon of civilised conduct. It is entirely unacceptable.'

The junior administrator, based in 
Liverpool but born in London, was identified by his web history uncovered by a Government-recruited cyber crime forensics team, in conjunction with research by internet group Wikipediocracy and the Daily Telegraph.

The investigation was launched in April after 34 IP addresses of Whitehall computers were found to be complicit in the changes.

Different users added the words ‘nothing for the victims of the Heysel 
stadium disaster’ to a description of the Hillsborough memorial at the 
Anfield stadium.

The Wikipedia changes were part of a slew by Whitehall computers that investigators have failed to trace

Further
 abusive revisions were traced to IP addresses of computers in the 
Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Treasury and the Solicitor 
General’s office.

On 
another occasion, the description of a statue of Liverpool manager Bill 
Shankly on the Anfield Wikipedia page was revised to change the 
well-known quote ‘He made the people happy’ to the bizarre ‘He made a 
wonderful lemon drizzle cake’.

After extensive inquiries, the 
24-year-old was identified as the author of a 2012 tweak, subjected to a
 formal disciplinary investigation, and fired for gross misconduct.

However, the investigation into other changes has been dropped due to a lack of leads.

Data logs have been deleted, making it difficult to trace historic edits, Mr Maude explained.

'Clearly he has little or no regard for the families or empathy for those killed'

- Barry Devonside, who lost his 18-year-old son Chris in the disaster

Users
 of the Government network are being 'reminded of their 
responsibilities' and social media guidance is being updated, he added.

'These
 incidents have given rise to questions about the Government Secure 
Intranet, about the way in which the internet is accessed from 
Government and its use recorded, and about social media policies in 
departments,' Mr Maude said.

'We will continue to encourage and enable
 civil servants to use the internet and social media, as essential tools
 enabling them to work openly and to be connected to the society they 
serve.

'But the misuse of social media is 
unacceptable and carries consequences. We will be reminding all civil 
servants of their responsibilities and updating social media guidance.'

Families of the victims have backed the move but agreed his name should be withheld.

Margaret Aspinall, chair of the 
Hillsborough Family Support Group, told the Daily Telegraph: 'We had a meeting
 on Friday evening and all the families agreed that his name should be 
withheld.

'He has been sacked, and we all took the decision not to name him because social media can be very unpleasant.

'The most important thing is that this has been dealt with and it has not been covered up. He has been punished.'

'Sickening': Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude (left) announced the sacking to MPs today, branding the alterations 'sickening'. Margaret Aspinall (right), spokesman for the victims' families, backed the move

Barry Devonside lost his son, Chris, 18, in the disaster.

Mr Devonside, attending the Hillsborough Inquests in Warrington, said today: 'I'm absolutely delighted that the investigation has come to a conclusion and they have identified the individual who made sickening comments on Wikipedia.

'Clearly this 24-year-old civil servant has little or no regard for the families or any empathy for those killed.

'He's brought it on himself. The words he used were sickening and I'm glad the investigation by the Government has come to a conclusion and his career with the Civil Service has now ended.'

Mr Maude added: 'I would like to thank
 the families themselves for their patience during the weeks it has 
taken to bring this matter to a conclusion.

'I was deeply distressed 
that, at a time when the hearings of the Hillsborough Inquests were 
unfolding, the Civil Service was brought into disrepute by these edits.

'No
 one should be in any doubt of the Government's position regarding the 
Hillsborough disaster and its support for the families of the 96 victims
 and all those affected by the tragedy.'
