Traditional GCSE alphabetic grades are to be replaced with a numerical system to make a clean break with the current discredited qualifications.

The A* to G system will be axed in favour of numbers from one to nine, with nine being the highest, say exam watchdogs.

Other changes include an end to different papers for pupils based on ability, except in subjects where they are considered necessary.

'I got a nine!': Traditional GCSE alphabetic grades are to be replaced with a numerical system to make a clean break with the current discredited qualifications, which are being totally revamped

Exam regulator Ofqual will also confirm today that end-of-course exams are to become the ‘default method of assessment’, killing off modular tests in most subjects.

They will generally be sat in the summer, ending the merry-go-round of pupils entered early or multiple times in the hope that they eventually score a good grade.

The changes apply to English literature, English language and maths being taught from September 2015. Other subjects will follow the year after.

Chief regulator Glenys Stacey admitted the move would be ‘challenging’ but added: ‘The changes will make sure they are better qualifications – better assessed and more resilient so that everyone can have greater confidence in the results.’

The reputation of GCSE has collapsed amid concern about grade inflation, easy modular assessments, dumbed down content and endless retakes.

The nine numerical grades – one more than the current alphabetic system – will provide a clear distinction between middle and higher grades, Ofqual said, and reduce ‘bunching’ around the B, C and D grades. The extra grade is also intended to ‘signal that new GCSEs are new qualifications’.

However, making nine the highest grade will fuel speculation that there is room to add more in future – in a similar way that a star was added to A grades. Mrs Stacey insisted this was unlikely but refused to rule it out.

She added: ‘People will want to make comparisons between the new and old grading scales and to know which new grade is the same as an existing C grade, for example.’

It all rides on this: Exam regulator Ofqual will also confirm today that end-of-course exams are to become the 'default method of assessment'

Governments of all political stripes have spent almost 100 years tinkering with the exam system.

From 1918, 16-year-olds sat the School Certificate, in which candidates had to pass maths, English and three other subjects.

It was abolished in 1951 when O-levels were introduced.

Pass grades of A-E were developed  for the predominantly exam-based qualification, although some boards used 1-6. Fails were shown by a U grade or 7-9 respectively.

From 1975, all boards adopted the letter-based system. CSEs were available from 1965 for less able pupils, with a Grade 1 the equivalent to a C at O-level.

Students last sat the exams in 1987, and they were replaced the following year by GCSEs. The new qualifications made widespread use of coursework and controlled assessments and were graded A to G, with a U for fails.

A* grades were first used in 1994 to show the highest level of achievement.

But dumbing down and grade inflation under Labour led to many public schools ditching GCSEs in favour of alternatives such as IGCSEs, which have an option to do no coursework.

Since the Coalition came to power, attempts have been made to restore  their reputation.

Grade inflation was suppressed and other changes included giving more marks for correct spelling, grammar and punctuation. Plans are also under way to change the curriculum.

Both the English and maths exams are 
tiered at the moment, with foundation papers available for weaker 
pupils. In future, all candidates will sit the same exams in English 
literature and language, giving everyone the chance to achieve top 
grades.

Maths will remain 
tiered, however, reflecting a huge difference in ability among 
candidates. To avoid cherry-picking results, anyone who retakes a 
subject will have to sit all the exams again.

Only
having end of year assessments could also help boys, who are 
outperformed by girls in almost every subject but are believed to 
perform better under exam conditions.

But Christine Blower, general 
secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the changes would be 
confusing to the public.

Labour schools spokesman Kevin Brennan said it 
was ‘odd’ that the Conservatives wanted more rigorous exams when they 
allowed unqualified teachers in some schools.

And Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, claimed the reforms had been ‘rushed through at breakneck speed, driven on by a political imperative, rather than the needs of pupils’.

Pupils first sat GCSEs in 1988, replacing the old two-tier assessment structure of  O-levels and CSEs.
