Schools are to be barred from ordering pupils to run around a playing field as punishment.

In her first significant break from her predecessor, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is to scrap guidelines for headteachers set out by Michael Gove which suggest misbehaving children should be made to do laps of the school grounds.

While the news has been welcomed by sports campaigners, one Tory MP described it as ‘a load of politically correct claptrap’.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said that making pupils run laps could put them off physical activity

Earlier this year, schools were told ‘tough but proportionate’ punishment could include writing lines, picking up litter in playgrounds, weeding, tidying classrooms and removing graffiti.

Pupils could also be ordered to report to school early, clean dining halls or forfeit privileges such as joining in a non-uniform day.

While Mrs Morgan is understood to support old-fashioned punishments, a private letter seen by the Daily Mail reveals she has agreed to a U-turn on using physical exercise to discipline children.

Writing to campaigners who criticised using exercise as punishment, she said she agreed with figures such as marathon runner Paula Radcliffe, who argued that ‘physical activity is a joy, a pleasure’ rather than a means to improve bad behaviour.

Mrs Morgan is herself a keen runner, and is due to take part in a half marathon in Leicester next month.

In the letter to former long-distance runner David Moorcroft, who is chairman of the Run Group which promotes exercise, Mrs Morgan said: ‘I share your view that it [using exercise as a punishment] threatens to have a negative impact on the sport and on the view young people take of it. 

'One of my priorities as Secretary of State is to encourage schools to do what they can to build the resilience and character of our young people, and I see sport as playing a crucial role in this.’

She added: ‘I have therefore asked officials to revise the guidance immediately and to remove any suggestion that running might be used as a form of punishment. A new version of the document – minus the offending clause – will be issued on the department’s website by the end of the week.’

Conservative MP for Shipley Philip Davies described the U-turn as a 'load of politically correct claptrap' 

Responding to the U-turn, Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said: ‘What a load of politically correct claptrap. I remember having to run round the rugby pitch a few times when I misbehaved at school. It seemed to me like a perfectly reasonable punishment having done something wrong.

‘I’m sure it must be more constructive for children to run round a playing field than to stand outside a teacher’s room. I thought we were supposed to be concerned about rising obesity?’

But Mr Moorcroft said: ‘Nicky Morgan understood from the start why this mattered and has delivered a change on an issue that could have had a negative impact on running for future generations.

‘As a former PE teacher who remembers the bad old days, the inclusion of such a sanction had been particularly disappointing given the Olympic and Paralympic Legacy objective of encouraging participation in school sports and wider society.’

Before the guidance was issued, the Government argued many heads and teachers were unclear of what action they could take to discipline pupils, with almost one in three secondary teachers saying they did not feel confident using the powers they already had.

A new super grade is to be introduced because too many bright youngsters were awarded top marks
