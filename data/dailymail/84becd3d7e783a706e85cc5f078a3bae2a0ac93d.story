Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, appearing this morning in his first nationally-broadcast interview since announcing yesterday that he would run for president, attempted to shed his conservative hardliner image.

Cruz said social liberals were 'absolutely' welcome in his version of the Republican Party and that he's willing to compromise - as long as those concessions move the country forward.

'I have never said I won't compromise,' Cruz told Today's Matt Lauer after the ABC News host asked if he'd bring the same brand of 'no compromise' politics to the White House that he's brought to the Senate.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz appeared this morning in his first nationally-broadcast interview since announcing yesterday that he would run for president

Cruz, accompanied by his wife Heidi for the interview, attempted to shed his conservative hardliner image. 'I have never said I won't compromise,' he told Today's Matt Lauer after the ABC News host asked if he'd bring the same brand of 'no compromise' politics to the White House that he's brought to the Senate

The 44-year-old Texas senator contended that from day one he has said he'd compromise the way that revered Republican president Ronald Reagan did. 

'What do you do if they offer you half a loaf? Answer: you take it,' he said, 'and then come back.'

Confronted with a past statement in which he said, 'I don't think Washington needs is more compromise,' Cruz suggested to Lauer that his words had been misinterpreted.

'What Washington does often is it compromises going backwards,' he said.

'I'm perfectly happy to work with anyone, Democrat, independent, libertarian, Republican, if they are shrinking the size and power of the federal government, if they are turning around the debt, if they're expanding liberty.'

Cruz said that lawmakers in the nation's capitol often makes deals that are 'not a good compromise' thought because they don't fix the problem at hand.

A freshman senator, Cruz said he's sought 'more than anything else' during his time in the federal government is to 'tell the truth' and 'do what I said I would do.'

Though voters may not always agree with his principles, the conservative lawmaker said he believes they can respect that he stays true to his word. 

With his run for the White House Cruz said he hopes to rebuild the coalition that elected Reagan and attract more women, Hispanics and young people to the Republican Party.

Presidential candidate-in-waiting Rand Paul suggested in an interview Monday night on Fox News that his Senate colleague panders too much to conservatives to grow the GOP, however.

Acknowledging that he and Cruz have 'very, very similar voting records,' Paul said 'what makes us different is probably our approach as to how we would make the party bigger.'

'And I’m a big believer that you should stand on principle, and be true to your principles. But I also think that we should take those principles and try to bring in new people with them,' he asserted.

Paul pointed out that as part of his preparations for a national run, he's traveled to areas that Republicans don't traditionally campaign in and spoken to groups such as the NAACP that Republicans haven't historically engaged with.

'And maybe not just throwing out red meat, but actually throwing out something intellectually enticing to people who haven’t been listening to our message before.'

Continuing he said, 'So, it isn’t just about rousing the base, it’s about exciting the base by being for the principles of liberty, but it’s then taking those principles of liberty, not diluting them, and taking them to new people and bringing them into the party.

'That’s the way you win general elections.'

The 52-year-old freshman lawmaker argued that his approach makes him more viable in a general election that other conservatives vying for the nomination - including Cruz.

'There will be a lot of conservatives. Ted Cruz is a conservative, but it also goes to winnability, and people will have to make a decision which is the Republican that can not only excite the base, but can also bring new people into the party without giving up principles,' he said, noting that he fares better in polls against presumed Democratic presidential candidate, and nominee, Hillary Clinton.

Heidi said a trait that drew her to her husband was that he is 'a person of conviction.' She said, 'Ted Cruz is someone who tells the truth. He knows what he believes'

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul speaks with diners at Beantowne Coffee House & Cafe on Saturday in Hampstead, New Hampshire. Paul said in an interview Monday that he'd be a better general election candidate than Cruz or any of the other conservatives running because he appeals to groups that are not  traditionally Republican

Joining Cruz for his interview Tuesday morning was his wife, Heidi.

A trait that drew her to her husband, the the senator's wife said, is that he is 'a person of conviction.'

'Ted Cruz is someone who tells the truth. He knows what he believes.'

He's also very 'agile' in fragile situations, she said, repeating phrasing Lauer used in a question to her.

Lauer had noted Cruz's kindly response to a little girl at one of his recent speeches who became frightened when he claimed that the 'world is on fire.'

Heidi said he takes the same care when addressing his six-year-old, Caroline. 

Recently, Caroline came home from school, she said, upset that everyone was talking about her father rather than her. 

'And Ted said, "Wow," he said," the same is true for me. I spend my day talking about you!"= 

Mrs. Cruz, who has not made herself available in the past for major media interviews quite like her talkative husband, commented that it may not be possible to ever 'feel fully prepared' for a journey like the one she and her family are taking, 'but we have a very strong marriage, an incredibly strong family, and are guided by our faith.

'I think we are ready to see change in this country,' she added. 'We're honored to have a voice in that.'
