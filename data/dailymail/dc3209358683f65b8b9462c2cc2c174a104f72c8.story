Stuart Pearce claims Jack Wilshere won’t even kick a ball for England at the World Cup.

The former England Under-21 coach claims the Arsenal midfielder is short of form and confidence ahead of the opening game against Italy in Manaus on Saturday.

Pearce told talkSPORT: ‘I think there are five players that will not kick a ball at the World Cup. Forster and Foster are the obvious ones and I think Shaw, Smalling and Wilshere will be the others.

Bench mark? Jack Wilshere will not get any playing time at the World Cup, according to Stuart Pearce

'I think he [Wilshere] is very, very short of form. Watching the last game [against Honduras] I didn’t see a Wilshere that sprung on the scene many months ago.

'I just think he is very, very short of confidence and I see Lampard, Lallana or Barkley ahead of him now. I just feel his lack of form really [will cost him] and that will be on Roy’s mind.

Psycho babble: Stuart Pearce reckons there are at least five players who will not feature for England in Brazil

‘He had a very disappointing last game and he has not shown me the fully fit Wilshere we saw when he came on the scene.’ 

The former England Under 21 coach had previously insisted that rising star Ross Barkley should not be in Brazil this summer at all.

Pearce claims that Roy Hodgson is harming 
England's long-term chances of success by picking young players such as 
Barkley and Shaw and leaving them on the bench, rather than handing
 them guaranteed game time in international age-group football.
