Evil: Kevin Clifford pictured outside Leicester Crown Court before he was jailed for 16 years for the brutal assault on his son Gary Clifford

An evil father who beat his son while he was hanging upside down from a forklift truck, before welding him into a cage has been jailed for 16 years.

Gary Clifford, 29, was left with a broken arm, two broken legs, a fractured foot and hundreds of cuts and bruises after his father and uncle tortured him - believing he had stolen jewellery from his step-mother.

Leicester Crown Court heard how Gary’s father, Kevin Clifford, 51, uncle, Patrick Clifford, and a third man, John Cope, 47, had beaten Gary within an inch of his life and dumped him outside a pub.

Sentencing Kevin to 16 years behind bars for GBH and false imprisonment, Judge Ebraham Mooncey called him an 'evil man' and said he couldn’t understand how a father could inflict such horrendous injuries on his own son.

The court heard that Kevin Clifford lured his son to a workshop at the back of his home, with the offer of work, to carry out the barbaric punishment.

During the attack his son was welded into the cage, had brake fluid sprayed into his face and was threatened with being set on fire.

Prosecutor James Thomas said the assault was 'horrendous, amounting to torture'.

The victim was subjected to the horrific and prolonged attack after he was suspected of stealing gold jewellery from his stepmother, Kevin Clifford’s wife, in April last year.

The court was told father Kevin knew Cope was looking for Gary following a fall-out and recruited him, and his own brother, Patrick, 44, to help with the horrendous attack.

Gary of Derbyshire suffered multiple broken bones and lash marks having been relentlessly beaten with a baseball bat, a pipe and an industrial hose.

Cope has turned up after Gary was welded into the cage and a jury heard that when he was taken out, Cope laughed as he smashed Gary’s kneecaps into several pieces.

He too was handed 16 years in jail for false imprisonment and GBH.

Mr Clifford was also battered in the face by his hammer-wielding uncle, who was jailed for 12 years after he admitting false imprisonment and inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: 'Experienced ambulance officers said the injuries were the most extreme they’d ever seen.

'You don’t often hear of someone being hung upside down from a forklift truck and caged. He had a sack put over his head and a cable around his neck.

'Patrick and Kevin Clifford gave him a beating as he hung upside down and he received many injuries, from the waist to his head, at the hands of his father.

'It was a systematic beating of the most vile kind.

'The father of the victim stood calmly in court when he gave evidence, telling lie upon lie to the jury, saying he wasn’t involved in this enterprise.''It’s hard to fathom how a father, his own flesh and blood, could to something like this.

'I watched you giving evidence and I take the view you’re an evil man and you shouldn’t have done that to your son, whatever he’d done.

'The victim was subjected to gratuitous degradation.'Kevin Clifford and Cope had denied the charges, claiming they played no part in the violence but were both convicted after trial

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Castle said: 'This could easily have been a murder investigation. This young man has been through a horrendous ordeal and I hope today’s verdict goes some way to bringing closure on this chapter of his life.'Speaking after the trial Gary Clifford said: 'This incident has changed my life. It was absolutely horrendous and at the time I was wishing I could die. The pain was so unreal.

'But since then I have managed to move forward and I now want to put it behind me.'
