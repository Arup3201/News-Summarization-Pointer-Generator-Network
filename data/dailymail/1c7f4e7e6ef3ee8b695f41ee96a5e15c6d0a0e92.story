Coleen Rooney models her SS14 collection for Littlewoods.com. This Spot Mesh Sleeve Dress is £60

Set in an expensive hotel room, the sixties-themed shoot is complemented with Collen's beauty look of bouffant hair and feline eye make up.

The fabric contrast shift dress, £60, with polka dot mesh detailing comes in a bold red hue for an instant statement.

Its woven crepe fabric makes it super lightweight and comfortable for the hotter months, while sheer spot sleeves and neckline add a fun and flirty twist.

The elegant jersey illusion dress, £48, features geometric print which gives it the appeal of luxe texture with a smooth surface finish.

Contrast black side panels create a narrow effect for a neat hourglass look, while demure capped sleeves and shallow rounded neckline add a touch of class.

She was spotted on the beach in Barbados on Wednesday as she took an idyllic stroll.

The
 WAG has been enjoying a sunny holiday at the Caribbean island’s Sandy 
Lane Hotel with children, Kai, 4, and 9-month-old Klay while their 
father, Manchester United striker Wayne, remains in storm-battered 
England.

Stepping out for another day on the sand, Coleen looked 
bright and breezy in a white, off-the-shoulder Michelle kaftan by 
Melissa Odabash as she padded across the shore.
