Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has ruled out joining a Premier League club before he retires from football.

The 33-year-old, who has played in Sweden, Holland, Italy, Spain and France, has often been linked with big money switches to England but a move has failed to materialise.

Now in his third season with PSG, Ibrahimovic insists he wants to stay with the Ligue 1 champions and will never ply his trade in the Premier League.

Clubs: Malmo, Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain 

Total club appearances: 432 

Total club goals: 250 

International caps: 100

International goals: 50 

Honours: Eredivisie title (twice), Serie A title (four times), La Liga title (twice), Ligue 1 title (twice)

Asked whether he'll represent an English club in the future in an interview with The Guardian, the former Barcelona forward said: 'No. I am happy in Paris. I respect the Premier League. 

'It's one of the best in the world and no other league has this media interest. But I'm happy I've played in so many different leagues.'

The Sweden striker had a trial with Arsenal while playing for his local club Malmo as a youngster but, having complete confidence in his own ability, was left unimpressed with having to try and earn a deal with Arsene Wenger's side.

Ibrahimovic said: 'Today, Wenger says it was a misunderstanding. But I didn't like being asked to prove myself. I know I'm good enough. I don't need to show it to you. Either you know who I am or you don't.

'I remember being in Wenger's office and you could tell he was the boss. It was Wenger! But I don't think I was so close [to signing]. I went to Ajax the next day.'

Despite never having played in England's top-flight, there is one Three Lions star who has won Ibrahimovic's respect in recent years.

'I do like [Wayne] Rooney. For me he has a lot of hunger when he plays. I think he's good for the team,' he said.

Unfortunately for the rest of Roy Hodgson's squad, the ex-Juventus star is less familiar with England's other players.

He added: 'The rest? I cannot judge them because I don't know them.'
