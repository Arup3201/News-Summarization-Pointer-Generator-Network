The Lib Dems would be happy to join a coalition with the Tories or Labour after the election, Nick Clegg said yesterday, dismissing predictions that more than half his MPs would lose their seats.

The Lib Dem leader said he would add heart to the Tories or backbone to Labour, during a TV interview.

Defying bleak opinion polls, he denied his party would be trounced at the election on May 7. But a forecast yesterday by influential pundit Iain Dale – who correctly predicted EU election results – suggests the party would keep just 24 of 56 seats.

Denial: Nick Clegg dismissed predictions that more than half his MPs would lose their seats, and said he would be happy to govern in coalition with either Labour or Tories

Mr Dale expects Labour to be the largest party with 302 seats, ahead of the Tories with just 279 MPs after a loss of 28 seats.

This would mean Labour, even in coalition with the Lib Dems, would have a majority of just one in the 650-seat Commons, paving the way for a ‘rainbow coalition’ with a third party such as the Scottish Nationalists, who are predicted to take 12 Labour and Lib Dem seats in Scotland and keep the six they have. 

As a result, the Lib Dems could hold the balance of power even if they do badly in May.

The party has suffered a number of setbacks, including a backlash after reneging on its pledge to block any increase in university fees, which tripled to £9,000.

Mr Clegg claimed yesterday he should have described the rise as a graduate tax to make it clear that students do not pay up front but repay it after they get a job.

Pondering: The Deputy Prime Minister took a few moments to reflect ahead of his appearance

A study of every constituency in the country by political commentator Iain Dale reveals no two parties will be able to get over 325 seats to secure an overall majority

He added: ‘What we’ve actually introduced is a graduate tax and I wish we’d called it a graduate tax. I suspect it would have saved us a lot of heartache.’

The Deputy Prime Minister dismissed the idea that his party would not do well in the election, claiming the Lib Dem message that they would ‘cut less than the Conservatives, borrow less than Labour’ appealed to voters. 

Yesterday he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I’m not going to pretend that I’m going to be Prime Minister.

'I wish I might become Prime Minister, but I think it’s most likely that Liberal Democrats back in government mean either a coalition with Labour or a coalition with the Conservatives. 

'We would add, as we have done for five years, heart to a Conservative-led coalition and sort of spine and backbone on the economy which clearly the Labour Party lacks.’

Asked which he would prefer, he said: ‘It’s not about my personal preferences or whims. 

'I feel as passionately I disagree as much Ed Miliband’s flaky approach to the economy as I do with the Conservatives’ heartless approach to society.

‘I think we will do so much better than the pundits are predicting. 

'Iain Dale will have to eat his words – some of his predictions are getting a bit silly.’

In a sign of confidence that his party will be in coalition again, he said he would find it ‘difficult to imagine’ governing alongside Alex Salmond, Scotland’s former First Minister who is likely to win a seat for the SNP. 

He also said he would not sit in a cabinet with Ukip – predicted to win five seats.
