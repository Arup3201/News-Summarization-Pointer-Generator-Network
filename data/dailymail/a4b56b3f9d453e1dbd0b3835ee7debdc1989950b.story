Crossbench peer Baroness Meacher said that like illegal drugs, her morning coffee was not safe

Youngsters should be encouraged to switch from drinking alcohol to taking drugs, the head of a powerful parliamentary group said yesterday.

Baroness Meacher also compared taking banned substances to drinking coffee.

The former social worker insisted some drugs are ‘a good deal safer’ than tobacco and alcohol and said it may be a ‘very good thing’ if teenagers stopped getting drunk and took some types of legal highs instead.

Her comments came the day after the All Party Parliamentary Group for Drug Policy Reform, of which she is chairman, called for the possession and use of heroin, ecstasy and crack cocaine to be decriminalised altogether, which would relegate it to the status of a minor driving offence.

The report suggested that giving criminal records to young drug users creates ‘higher levels of unemployment, homelessness and relationship problems’.

It also called for licences to be issued to allow chemists to sell so-called ‘legal highs’, which have been blamed for causing more than 40 deaths in a single year.

Baroness Meacher told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘No drugs are completely safe.

Coffee is not safe. I have just had a cup but it isn’t safe.

‘The fact is some of these drugs are a good deal safer than tobacco and alcohol. It may be a very good thing if we could get some young people to switch from alcohol.

‘As you know, a lot of young people 
are drinking far too much. Get them to switch to something rather 
safer.’ The cross-bench peer, who is paid up to £50,000 a year by the 
NHS, said many young people are ‘determined’ to take drugs but there was
‘nowhere’ for them to do so.

If hard drugs are decriminalised users would escape with a fine, confiscation and no criminal record

Under existing laws users of drugs such as heroin, cocaine or ecstasy face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail, along with a criminal record, but the new report calls for a weakening of these regulations

Under the group’s plan, chemists 
would have to show that the substances carried only an ‘agreed low risk 
of harm’. They would be given licences and regulated by council trading 
standards officers.

Yesterday, Baroness Meacher suggested they could stock ‘legal highs that are a substitute for ecstasy’.

Taking drugs would remain illegal but users would escape with a fine, confiscation and no criminal record.

The report drew an angry response from anti-drugs campaigners.

Tory MP Michael Ellis, a member of 
the home affairs committee, said: ‘It is balderdash to say that we 
should legalise drugs. We would see increased A&E admissions, 
increased criminal justice incidents as well as far more deaths and 
injuries.’

Mary Brett, of Cannabis Skunk Sense, 
said drugs would fall into the hands of minors if made readily 
available. She added: ‘Does she think the drug dealers will just pack up
and go home?

‘They are criminals, they will smuggle them in and undercut the price. They will still target the under 18s.’

The Lib Dems want a major review of 
Britain’s drug laws, but the idea is being fiercely resisted by the 
Prime Minister. Yesterday, David Cameron’s official spokesman said: 
‘[His] very strong, clear view is that the approach we currently have is
the right one and is working.’

Molly Meacher has held a string of 
public sector and quango posts in her career which have granted her 
significant influence over public life.

The
ex-wife of the Labour firebrand Michael Meacher, she worked as a social
worker before becoming a commissioner for the Mental Health Act in 
1987.

She was a senior adviser to the Russian government on employment in the 1990s, while filling key roles on London health trusts.

She
is also a former deputy chairman of the Police Complaints Authority and
chairman of the Security Industry Authority – a hugely controversial 
quango which granted hundreds of illegal immigrants permission to work 
as bouncers.
