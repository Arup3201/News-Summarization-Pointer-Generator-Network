Biter: Leake Academy girls basketball coach, Doyle Wolverton, is accused of biting a player in the face. The coach was apparently angry during the time out and was in the face of the girl. It escalated and the biting happened on the court

A girls' high school basketball coach in Mississippi has resigned after being accused of biting a player in the face.

Leake County Sheriff Greg Waggoner says Leake Academy coach Doyle Wolverton is accused of biting the unnamed player during a timeout in a November 12th game.

The player was brought to a hospital emergency room in Carthage after the team returned, and hospital employees called the sheriff's office because the injury allegedly stemmed from an assault.

Wolverton resigned Monday, though the Leake Academy coach said he couldn’t 'confirm nor deny' that claim.

According to the complaint, which was filed by Toby Thaggard of Carthage, Wolverton allegedly grabbed Thaggard’s daughter, listed as the 'victim' in the report, 'by the shirt and then bit her on the right side of the face,' as if he was getting on to her for making a bad play.

'We’re not commenting on that today,' Leake Academy headmaster Jerry Crowe said Monday afternoon. 'We’ll comment more on that (Tuesday).'

The report then states Thaggard took the victim, whose name was redacted in the complaint, to the emergency room, where deputies observed a “bruised bite mark on the lower right side of her face.

'We haven’t been involved with anything directly since (the hospital) because the parents and coach are trying to settle matters themselves,' Waggoner said.

Thaggard stated in the complaint he didn’t want to pursue charges when the report was filed last Tuesday.

Stellar Record: Wolverton had more than 1,200 career wins over his 38-year careers. His team won 15 private school state championships during his tenure, including seven straight from 2006-12

A police report obtained by WJTV-TV states a deputy took pictures of the bite mark.

The girl's parents took her to the hospital to get medical treatment for her bloody and bruised face.

Waggoner says the family decided not to file charges after Wolverton resigned.

Despite the police report, Hattiesburg native Marty Stamper said he didn’t notice anything atypical when he attended the game.

'Usually if something goes on, you’ll have parents or somebody carrying on and hollering,' Stamper said. 'There was none of that, and I was sitting straight across from the Leake Academy bench.'

Wolverton currently ranks second  nationally in wins by a high school girls basketball coach (he trails Leta Andrews, who is still coaching  in Texas and has 1,375 career wins).

He entered the season with 1,245 victories (against 181 losses) in his tenure at Leake Academy, which began in 1975.

The Neshoba Democrat reports Wolverton coached at Leake Academy in Madden for 38 years and has a record of more than 1,200 career wins.

The basketball court bears Wolverton's name. Coach Doyle was second in the nation for all-time wins in high school girls’ basketball, and a member of the Mississippi Private Schools Coaches Hall-of-Fame.
