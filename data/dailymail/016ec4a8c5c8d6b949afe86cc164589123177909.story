It reads almost like a long-lost script of an Indiana Jones movie.

But a Dutch archaeologist has claimed to have cracked the secret to a trove of Nazi gold - through a sheet of music he claims is a 'coded treasure map'.

Leon Giesen, 51, has performed three digs for the loot near Mittenwald, on the Austrian border but has so far come up with nothing.

X marks the score: Leon Giesen, 51, has performed three unsuccessful digs for the loot in the hills near Mittenwald (pictured), on the Austrian border, but has vowed to continue, convinced a sheet of music holds the key

He has based his searches on a single 
score of recently uncovered music called 'March Impromptu' and penned by
 classical composer Gottfried Federlein, who died in 1952.

He believes that a lyric in the music
 that reads 'Wo Matthias die Saiten Streichelt,' or 'where Matthew 
plucks strings,' in fact refers to Mittenwald and one-time resident 
Matthias Klotz, the town's fabled violin maker.

Final orders: Adolf Hitler is said to have ordered his private secretary, Martin Bormann (right), to bury a hoard of ill-gotten bullion somewhere in the Bavarian hills during the last days of the Third Reich

Golden boy: Bormann (right) was then instructed to imbed a series of letters, figures and runes on the sheet music that would, when deciphered, lend the coordinates of the treasure

He
 also believes the music contains a diagram of 'train tracks' that once 
ran through Mittenwald in the 1940s, and that the score's final 
sentence, 'Enden der Tanz,' which means 'end the dance' suggests the 
gold is at the railway's buffer stops.

It is well-known that the Nazis hid much of the gold, silver and jewels plundered during their conquests.

The regime executed a policy of looting the assets of its victims to finance the war, collecting the looted assets in top-secret central depositories.

Much of it included valuables confiscated from prisoners arriving at concentration camps before it was melted down into bullion.

But as the war drew to a close, they desperately tried to 'make it disappear' instead of letting it fall into allied hands.

Some has been found in caves or vaults (pictured) but much of it still remains unaccounted for.

Some of it is even believed to have been laundered into European banks in 1945.

According
 to Spiegel Online, Adolf Hitler ordered his private secretary, Martin 
Bormann, to bury a hoard of ill-gotten bullion somewhere in the Bavarian
 hills during the last days of the Third Reich.

Bormann was then instructed to imbed a
 series of letters, figures and runes on the sheet music that would, 
when deciphered, lend the coordinates of the treasure.

The score was then supposed to be couriered to Munich. But it never arrived.

Some 50 years later, Dutch journalist
 Karl Hammer Kaatee came across the document and went on to perform a 
series of abortive digs. But finally, with no gold in sight, he decided 
to make the supposed map public.

Giesen has found pockets of 'anomalous' metals, but is yet to find anything of real value. He is convinced, however, that his hunt will not be in vain and is trying to raise the funds for another dig.

'It's like a treasure map that can't be deciphered,' JÃ¼rgen Proske, a German historian, told Speigel. 'It could be a treasure chest. But it could just be a manhole cover.'
