The hairdresser daughter of a former British policeman was horrifically murdered on a blind date by a drug-crazed criminal, a court in Australia was told today.

Elsa Corp, 26, was found in a hotel room with an electrical cord around her neck, 60 stab wounds to her head and neck, a stab wound in her back, a severed spine, multiple rib fractures, facial fractures and a torso injury that is believed to have been made with a steam iron.

After murdering the young blonde, killer David Clifford, 30 - who was on parole at the time - set fire to the hotel room and drove into two people as he fled the scene.

Murdered: Elsa Corp, 26, was found in a hotel room after being killed by David Clifford, 30, who was on parole at the time

His first hit-and-run victim as he fled was a woman and the second was a man, who was carried along on the bonnet for 40 yards.

'The murderer was on parole and on bail for other offences,' Miss Corp's father, former UK police officer Mr Andrew Corp, said in a victim impact statement to the Victorian Supreme Court today following Clifford's plea of guilty to murder.

'He should not have been at liberty on the first of February 2010â€¦our daughter should be with us today.'

Mr Corp said earlier that his experience as a former British policeman was of no help when tragedy touched his own family.

'I thought I'd be a little better prepared because I'd seen some horrible things myself, but it's something that will live with us always, I'm afraid,' he told Melbourne's Herald Sun.

'The flashbacks and the nightmares and all that sort of stuff is pretty gutting. Our lives have changed - not for the better, sadly.'

Crime scene: Miss Corp agreed to meet Clifford on a blind date before being taken to the City Park Hotel in Melbourne

The court was told that Clifford had a history of drug abuse and violent behaviour - facts unknown to Miss Corp, who lived with her parents, after she agreed to meet him on a blind date before being taken to the City Park Hotel in Melbourne.

She is believed to have agreed to go to the hotel thinking that other friends were going to be there.

A man with a history of speed and ice abuse, Clifford's convictions include resisting police after a home invasion during which he terrified two elderly people last December.

He was also arrested, but not charged, over a siege at his own family home which involved up to 30 police in December 2006.

Two years later he had to be tied up and restrained by family members after he became delusional and violent, claiming he was being eaten alive by mercury in his computer.

He has pleaded guilty to Miss Corp's murder and is awaiting sentencing, but Miss Corp's father said he was waiting for an apology from the authorities after a bureaucratic bungle allowed Clifford to leave prison and be at large to kill the hairdresser.

He had been released on parole for drug trafficking and had already breached parole and a suspended sentence following other earlier convictions. He was also awaiting sentence over a violent assault of a bar owner.

'No-one has taken responsibility for Elsa's death,' said Mr Corp, who, with his wife Gilly, expressed his disgust at Clifford's release on parole after just 47 days of a four-month jail sentence.

'It's absolutely gutted us because it was a very bad failure in the system. For the sake of a bit of training, or procedure or supervision, the system fell over and failed us.

'Our daughter would probably be alive today if there hadn't been these stuff-ups.'

A secret police report has disclosed that 11 people have been murdered in Victoria in less than two and a half years.
