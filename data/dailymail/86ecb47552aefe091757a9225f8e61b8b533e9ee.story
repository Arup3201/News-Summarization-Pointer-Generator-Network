Sol Campbell believes he should replace Gary Neville as England coach.   

Campbell played 73 times for England between 1996 and 2007 while his former team-mate and fellow defender Neville, who works as a Sky Sports pundit alongside his role with Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson, earned 85 caps between 1995 and 2007.

Campbell made the suggestion when he appeared at Cheltenham Literature Festival and was asked by a fan what he would do to stop England conceding so many goals.

'Get rid of Gary Neville and get me in instead,' he said. 'I've done all the badges.'

England, in fact, have kept four clean sheets in their last six games, only conceding in the 2-1 defeats by Italy and Uruguay at the World Cup.

Neville, meanwhile, already has UEFA A and B coaching licenses.

Campbell went on: 'I'm doing my coaching badges with the Welsh FA. I am on the last year of the pro licence. Whether I'm going to use it straightaway I'm not too sure. Whether I can use it here I don't know.

'But the career I have had should warrant me getting a job.' 

Campbell says if he doesn't get a job in England within a few years he will look abroad for a coaching post.

The ex-Arsenal and Tottenham centre back, who was at the festival to talk about a new authorised biography of his life and career, also said he believed that, as the best defender in the world at the peak of his career, he should have been England captain on more than just three occasions.

Racism is still a 'fundamental probem' in the sport which he believes affected his career.

'I had my colour to count against me,' he said. 'I should have captained my country more than three times. I was going toe-to-toe with Beckham and he got the captaincy.

'But I was getting better and better. I became one of the best defenders in the world and then the best defender in the world and captain of my domestic side. But the better you get the further away you get (from the England captaincy). To me it's not right. 'You conduct yourself in a proper way, in a proper manner, not falling out of night clubs and things like that.

'David was picked as captain and of course he ticked all the boxes. But what if every country adopted that kind of format? They don't.'

He added: 'Most teams don't go for a star player as captain. Germany don't do it, France don't do it, Italy don't do it and nor do Spain. It's not about the star name.'

Asked whether Wayne Rooney is the right captain now, Campbell said there was probably no other sensible choice from the present team.

'But Rooney is doing a fantastic job of losing it [the captaincy],' he added, referring to his recent red card against West Ham.

On the subject of West Ham, Campbell was asked about his infamous disappearance from a match at half-time in 2006 while playing for Arsenal. He took himself off to Brussels. It was just for a 'break', Campbell insisted, although his biographer Simon Astaire suggested it was more likely to be a breakdown.

'The reason I chose Brussels was because I had a lady friend there,' Campbell said. 'I just needed the break.'
