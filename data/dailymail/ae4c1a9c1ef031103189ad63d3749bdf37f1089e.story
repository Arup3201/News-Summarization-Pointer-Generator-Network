A mother has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity after a grand jury indicted her on three capital murder counts for the stabbing deaths of her three young daughters.

Carol Ann Coronado, 30, was also charged with the attempted murder of her own mother in the indictment unsealed on Monday in Los Angeles, California.

Coronado entered the insanity plea in a county court on Monday afternoon and is due to return for a hearing in three weeks.

Coronado allegedly killed her daughters - two-year-old Sophia (left), 16-month-old Yazmine (right) and two-month-old Xenia (center) at the family's California home in May 

Authorities alleged Coronado killed her daughters - two-year-old Sophia, 16-month-old Yazmine and two-month-old Xenia - then tried to kill her own mother when she found them at the family home in Torrance on May 20.

The indictment contains special circumstances allegations including multiple murders that make her eligible for the death penalty.

At a previous hearing, Coronado's attorney said she was suffering from post-partum depression. She is due to return to court on October 17.

In July, Coronado's husband spoke out in her defense, saying that his wife's undiagnosed condition was to blame for the tragedy. 

The mother-of-three was taken to a mental hospital after she tried to take her own life by stabbing herself in the chest, according to police. 

'I'm not a doctor but I know for a fact that was that disease, and it wasn't my wife,' Rudy Coronado told NBC Los Angeles in early July.

The grieving father revealed that there had been many warning signs before the murders but he did not know how to read them.

‘That's the reason why we need to bring awareness to [postpartum depression] because I was never educated on nothing like this,’ Mr Coronado said. ‘I didn't have a clue.’

He added that if it were not for the psychosis, his wife would not have hurt anyone 'in a million years'.

Coronado vehemently defended his wife, describing her as a 'great woman.'

‘She doesn't deserve to be where she's at,’ he said.  

The devastated Rudy Coronado had previously told MailOnline: 'I don’t know why the hell this happened, she killed my babies man, she killed my babies,' as tears streamed down his face.

'It was like a demon possessed,' he continued. 'She was a girl with a good career ahead of her, I just don’t know why it happened. If I knew why it happened, it would answer all my questions.’

Carol Coronado's mother Julie Piercey, first discovered the children's butchered bodies covered in blood lying lifeless in the bed at around 5pm on May 20. 

The accused killer is said by investigators to have then gone at the woman with a knife.

'Oh my God!' Piercey is said to have screamed before wrestling the knife from the hands of her blood-spattered daughter. Husband Rudy was outside working on his car when the killings occurred.

Police said Coronado was found naked and holding a knife after reportedly trying to cut her own wrists and stabbing herself in the chest. Several knives were recovered at a grisly scene.

'The babies were on the bed,' Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Coleman said.'And not in a haphazard fashion, they were placed on the bed, so how and where they were killed, we're going to have to figure that out.'

Sheriff's deputies took the mother, who was naked except for a blanket, to a patrol car and she was then placed in an ambulance, Madrid said.

Mrs Coronado joined the U.S. Army after high school but only spent a few months in the service before being released due to an injury, Lt. Coleman said.
