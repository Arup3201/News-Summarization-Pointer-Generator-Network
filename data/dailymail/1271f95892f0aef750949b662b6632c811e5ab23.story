Mario Balotelli enjoyed an evening watching the boxing in Liverpool on Saturday – despite the fact Brendan Rodgers’ side take on Crystal Palace in London at 1.30pm on Sunday.

Balotelli was escorted to his seat by three heavy-set bodyguards to watch Nathan Cleverly take on Tony Bellew at Liverpool’s Echo Arena.

However, his presence ringside raised doubts about whether he would miss Sunday’s game as his team-mates arrived at Gatwick airport just after 6.30pm on Saturday evening.

Balotelli was sent home early from international duty with Italy after picking up a hamstring injury in training but had not been ruled out of Sunday’s game.
