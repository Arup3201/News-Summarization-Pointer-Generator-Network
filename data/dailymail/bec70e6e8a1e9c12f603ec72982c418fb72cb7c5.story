Former bikie boss Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi has pleaded guilty to the fatal bashing of a rival associate at Sydney Airport five years ago.

The 34-year-old Comanchero member appeared before the  NSW supreme court on Friday where he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Hells Angels member Anthony Zervas who was beaten to death in 2009.

Hawi was jailed for at least 21 years in 2012 for the murder but had his conviction quashed in May when the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal ordered that he be retried.

The crown accepted Hawi's guilty plea  and he will now face sentencing on November 28.

The 2009 brawl broke out between the bikie gangs after Hawi and his colleagues happened to be on the same Melbourne-to-Sydney flight as then-Hells Angels president Derek Wainohu.

When Mr Zervas later attacked Hawi with scissors near check-in counters, the fighting broke out.

Mr Zervas, 29, suffered massive head injuries after being attacked with bollards and kicked, punched and stomped on.

Hawi was the only bikie convicted of Mr Zervas's murder, while 10 other Comancheros and two Hells Angels members either pleaded or were found guilty of other charges.

In sentencing Hawi in 2012, Justice Robert Allan Hulme said he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the bikie boss inflicted any blows at all on Mr Zervas.

But he said: 'His presence would undoubtedly have had the effect of authorising and approving the actions of the other man who bludgeoned Anthony Zervas to death.'

After his successful appeal, Hawi sparked an outcry over changes to the state's bail laws in June when he was released from custody pending the retrial.

Prosecutor Helen Roberts then told the court that the former bikie president still had ties to the organisation and posed an unacceptable risk to the community.

Under his conditions of his bail, Hawi was to report to police daily and adhere to a curfew.

He was not to associate with or contact certain people, not apply for a passport or go within a kilometre of an airport. 

The 34-year-old remains on bail.
