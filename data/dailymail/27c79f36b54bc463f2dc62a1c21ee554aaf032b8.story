What do you get when you mix a beautiful blonde dancer with a cool Swedish cocktail maker...one crazy party tour round the world! 

Skye Burkin, 21, from Coolangatta, Queensland, has won a competition called Ticket to the World after attending the European Bartender School on party island Kos for the last four weeks. 

Alongside Jesper Rydberg, 19, this party pair will travel across eight countries in the next five months sampling the world's best bars and hostels.  

Skye and Jesper are travelling across eight countries in five months after winning a competition 

The party pair are in Copenhagen hosting hostel parties and trying out their cocktail making skills

After spending the last month training in Greece the pair were selected for the trip because of their likability. 

According to the Ticket to the World website Skye was also selected because of her 'ability to perform under pressure, socialise with anyone in any given situation and her on-screen charisma'. 

'I love drinking and making cocktails, my favourite being the Caprioska,' she said. 

Skye and Jesper will be showing off their cocktail making and party skills across the globe

They will be getting a taste of the international bartending lifestyle across eight countries 

Jesper runs YouTube Channel S.A.M cocktails and he says his favourite cocktail is the Lynchburg Lemonade. 

He said: 'It is going to be the best time ever.' 

Twelve months ago the European Bartender School announced their plan to send two people around the world for five whole months, equipped with €10,000 for hotels and flight tickets.  

According to Ticket to the World Skye stood out as the 'perfect candidate' as a competition winner  

Jesper was chosen as a winner because he is a 'goofy, likable kind of guy' 

During their time at the bartending school Jesper used his YouTube experience to make videos for the website.

He also works as a bartender in Halmstad, Sweden and apparently 'excels at flair and anything relating to cocktail theory'.

Skye and Jesper have taken their final exams at EBS Kos, and are now in Copenhagen at the start of their trip which will take them to Dublin, Glasgow, Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, Sydney and Phuket. 

They will be writing a blog about their adventures where followers can keep up to date on what they are doing.
