Announcement: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is sending guns and ammunition to Iraq to forces fighting ISIS

Britain is gifting heavy machine guns and ammunition worth £1.6million to help Kurdish forces fighting ISIS in Iraq.

The weapons will arrive tomorrow and will be used to battle the extremist army, which is believed to include hundreds of Britons.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'The Kurdish forces remain significantly less well equipped than Isil (ISIS) and we are responding to help them defend themselves, protect citizens and push back advances.'

The announcement follows Prime Minister David Cameron's confirmation yesterday that Britain would be directly supplying the Kurds, who are fighting the extremist group that have seized large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.

Last week at the NATO summit in Wales Mr Cameron and Barack Obama prepared the ground for multi-national air strikes against Islamic State and for sending troops to form a Nato training force in Iraq.

In Britain, cross-party support for joining US military action was increasing. 

There is some speculation it could be weeks away. 

Mr Fallon said the gifting of the guns was needed as the Kurds are 'significantly less well-equipped' than ISIS

In a written ministerial statement, the Defence Secretary said: 'I am laying a departmental minute today concerning the gifting of military equipment to the Government of Iraq (GoI), including the Kurdish regional government. This is at the request of the GoI.

'The UK is committed to assisting the GoI by: alleviating the humanitarian suffering of those Iraqis targeted by Isil terrorists; promoting an inclusive, sovereign and democratic Iraq that can push back on Isil advances and restore stability and security across the country; and working with the international community to tackle the broader threat that Isil poses to the region and other countries around the world, including the UK.

'The Kurdish forces remain significantly less well-equipped than Isil and we are responding to help them defend themselves, protect citizens and push back Isil advances.

Brutal ISIS has captured swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria has declared itself an Islamic 'caliphate'

Kurdish fighters have retaken land from the Islamic State but Britain believes they need more guns and ammunition

'The initial gifting package is scheduled to arrive in Iraq on Wednesday September 10 and will consist of heavy machine guns and ammunition.

'The total cost is approximately £1.6 million plus an estimated £475,000 in transport costs.'

The announcement comes as US president Barack Obama prepares to outline his strategy for dealing with IS tomorrow.

Mr Cameron has said if Mr Obama announces further military action against the jihadists beyond the air strikes that have taken place and Britain is to join in that action, MPs will have a vote on the decision.

But he stressed that the Government could take action without the approval of Parliament in the event of an immediate humanitarian catastrophe or if a British interest needs urgent protection.
