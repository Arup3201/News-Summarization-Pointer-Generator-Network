Hero: lollipop lady Karin Williams was among those honoured with an award at tonight's Pride of Britain Awards in London

A lollipop lady who dived in front of an out-of-control car to push a group of children to safety was among those honoured at an awards ceremony to celebrate the country's unsung heroes.

Karin Williams was one of the courageous men and women recognised at the Pride of Britain Awards in London last night.

But despite her honour, the mother-of-one still insisted: 'I'm not brave.'

A host of famous faces including X Factor judges Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger, Queen guitarist Brian May and Prime Minister David Cameron turned out for the awards ceremony, now in its 15th year, at the Grovesnor Hotel in central London.

Among the other heroes honoured were Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot in the head by the Taliban because of her outspoken views on education for girls; Matthew Wilson, a soldier who carried on fighting to save his colleagues despite being shot in the head; and three women who comforted dying soldier Lee Rigby after he was killed in Woolwich earlier this year.

Mrs Williams,  50, from Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, was hailed by actor and comedian James Corden for 'one of the finest acts of bravery' at a star-studded event in central London.

She threw herself in front of a car when its 61-year-old driver lost control outside the school where she served as a lollipop lady to protect schoolchildren standing in the car's path.

Describing the horrifying incident, she said: 'I don't remember pushing the children away.

'I just remember standing on the pavement with the children around me waiting to cross, and the next thing I knew I was on the ground with a paramedic leaning over me telling me not to move.

'I wasn't in pain. I was in shock.'

Insisting that she isn't brave, she added: 'I did my job. It was pure instinct."

Brought onto the stage in a wheelchair, Mrs Williams was joined by a group of the children she saved, all of whom wore lollypop lady outfits and signs saying: 'Thanks Karin'.

Mrs Williams was rushed to hospital where she went through an eight-hour operation on multiple injuries to her kneecaps, legs, elbow and shoulder.

The hero lollipop lady managed to stand after being presented the award with her mother watching via video link from Germany - it was the first time she'd seen her stand since the incident.

The event was backed by more than 100 stars and public figures including David Beckham, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, and Usain Bolt, the six times Olympic sprint champion and fastest man in the world.

Beckham was shown presenting the teenager of courage award to Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old Pakistani teenager who was shot in the head by the Taliban after campaigning for girls' education.

Pulling through: Malala - who now attends Edgbaston High School for Girls - was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after the bullet went through her left eye

He told her: 'You're an amazing young lady, a very special young lady, and your story has moved millions of people around the world. I'm so privileged and honoured to present this award to you.'

Also honoured at the event - now in its 
15th year - at the Grosvenor House Hotel were RNLI rescue workers Paul 
Eastment, 46, Chris Missen, 25, and Martin Blaker-Rowe, 33, who saved a 
woman swept from a car in surging flood water in Umberleigh, Devon.

Other unsung heroes who received awards included the families of the 96 Liverpool fans who died in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, in recognition of their long fight for justice.

The award was collected by Margaret Aspinall, chairman of the Hillsborough Families Support Group.

Eight-year-old Harley Lane, from Stockport, Cheshire, whose legs and arms were amputated to save his life after he suffered meningitis as a toddler, was also honoured.

The schoolboy raised more than £1,000 earlier this year in a sponsored run using new prosthetic limbs.

Harley was struck down by meningitis, which developed into deadly meningococcal septicaemia within hours.

His heart stopped three times and doctors told Sam and her husband Adam that the only hope of saving their son’s life was to amputate both his arms and his legs

Clifford Harding, 36, from Birmingham, who volunteers as a youth worker with vulnerable children, won the Prince's Trust young achiever award.

Passers-by Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, from Cornwall, Amanda Donnelly, 44, and her daughter Gemini Donnelly-Martin, 20, received a bravery award for their actions in the aftermath of the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, earlier this year.

His unit had been on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines in Nahr-e Saraj when they came under enemy fire.

By drawing the sniper's attention, L/Cpl Wilson won time for a helicopter to fly in and rescue the injured soldier.

But his bravery almost cost him his own life, when a bullet struck his helmet, knocking him out. His horrified comrades feared L/Cpl Wilson was dead.

A few seconds later they watched in astonishment as he groggily got to his feet, sprinted 50 yards across open ground and began returning fire at the insurgent.

Good Samaritan: Ingrid Loyau-Kennett was recognised for comforting soldier Lee Rigby as he lay dying in Woolwich earlier this year

Incredibly, the round had deflected off 
the soldier’s helmet – saving his life, and leaving him with nothing 
worse than a ‘massive headache’.

His selfless actions allowed a helicopter to land and fly his stricken colleague, who had been shot in the leg, to safety.

He earned a Military Cross for his efforts.

The Pride of Britain awards will be screened on ITV at 8pm tomorrow.
