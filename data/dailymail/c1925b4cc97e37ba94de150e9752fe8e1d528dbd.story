Nick Clegg’s new adviser on motoring has seen the value of his electric car firm slump by a fifth after three vehicles burst into flames.

Billionaire Elon Musk, who founded PayPal, was revealed by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday to be working with the government  on how to increase take up of electric cars.

But his company Tesla Motor Inc has suffered a string of bad headlines about Model S electric cars being destroyed by fires.

Mr Clegg said the government has enlisted the help of the electric car pioneer to advise ministers on how to reach a ‘tipping point’ for the take-up of green vehicles.

The involvement of Mr Musk, who runs the firm behind the Tesla electric sports car, came as Mr Clegg called for large fleet companies, taxi firms and public agencies to explain what more could be done by ministers to encourage them to change to ultra-low emission vehicles.

Setting out the details of Mr Musk's role, Mr Clegg said: ‘He brings unmatched expertise to the table. Among other issues, he'll consider how we can boost investment, massively increase the take up of electric vehicles across the country and promote the benefits of ultra-low emission vehicles more widely to drivers.’

However, in the last week shares in Tesla have tumbled on the back of three Model S electric cars catching light and poor trading figures.

A Tesla Model S electric car caught fire 
this week after hitting road debris on a Tennessee freeway, the third 
fire in a Model S in the past five weeks. Two previous fires have also been linked to accidents, Tesla insists.

Tesla has sent a team to Tennessee to investigate the fire. Two other Model S cars have caught fire in the past five weeks, one near Seattle and the other in Mexico

The Model S has as a large battery pack under the passenger compartment, protected by a quarter-inch-thick metal shield.

Experts
say that if debris punctures the shield and damages the battery, it can
cause shorts and arcing that can touch off fires.

Yesterday shares fell by seven per cent, after falling by 14 per cent on Wednesday. The company has also posted weak financial results, after admitting selling fewer of the £60,000 cars than expected.

Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, said: ‘For a company with a stock price based as much or more on image than financials, those recurring headlines are highly damaging.’

The Model S can go more than 250 miles on a single charge

Mr Clegg had hoped Mr Musk's appointment would be the centrepiece of a speech attacking the Tories over their reluctance to commit to the green agenda.

But after news of the latest fire, a spokesman for the Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘We are not under any obligation to follow any of his recommendations.’

Mr Musk will not be paid to write his report on increasing the roll-out of charging points for electric cars, due to be published in the New Year.

The Government wants all new cars and vans purchased in the UK to be ‘effectively zero emission’ by 2040 and £400 million has been committed over the course of this Parliament to support the technology.
