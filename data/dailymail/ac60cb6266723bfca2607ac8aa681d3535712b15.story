Changed in what we eat, the way we read and how we celebrate have been reflected in the basket of goods used to calculate inflation.

Out go lettuce and restaurant champagne, in come stir-fry vegetables, blueberries, salami – and the ebook.

The changes were revealed yesterday as the Office of National Statistics listed nearly 700 goods it will use to track prices over the next year.

Sign of the times: Sales of eBooks are now so big that the price is to be included in calculating inflation, but Champagne has been dropped after sales in pubs and bars lost their fizz

The shopping basket, updated every spring, provides an insight into evolving lifestyles and priorities.

But its main significance is that the
results are used to produce the Government’s official inflation 
benchmarks, the Consumer Prices Index and the Retail Prices Index – used
to determine increases in everything from pensions to rail fares.

Items added to the ONS basket

The ONS measures the prices of items in the basket every month, based on 180,000 separate checks across the country.

It changes the basket using data from
more than 5,000 households.

The additions this year look very much like
a shopping list for a typical middle-class family.

Blueberries, prized as a superfood, 
are on the list despite the high price per punnet.

Similarly, packs of 
stir-fry vegetables are a staple where working parents want to put 
together a quick, nutritious meal.

Delicatessen-style meats such as 
prosciutto, salami and chorizo reflect changing eating habits, driven by
foreign travel and TV chefs such as Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver.

Advances in home technology have seen standard Freeview boxes replaced 
by receivers that allow people to pause and record live TV.

And ebooks are booming, even if downloads are often not much cheaper than the paperback.

The ONS said: ‘Changes to the basket 
will reflect evolving consumer tastes, but only over a long run of 
years.

'Aside from new technology, a number of new items are introduced 
to represent specific markets where consumer spending is significant.’
