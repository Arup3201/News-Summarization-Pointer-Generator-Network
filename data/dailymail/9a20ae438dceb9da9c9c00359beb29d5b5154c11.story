She was faced with a decision no mother should ever have to make - her daughter's life or her legs.

This was what was put to Donna Schulke, from Portland, Oregon, after her daughter was rushed to hospital with a life-threatening infection that was poised to ravish her whole body.

Tabitha Schulke, 18, began experiencing 
flu-like symptoms on Thanksgiving morning. Suddenly, her illness 
worsened and she began developing gangrene on her feet. Her heart stopped on the way to the hospital.

Next thing Donna knew, a surgeon was asking her that impossible question, explaining that the only option to stop the spread
of infection that was killing her daughter was to amputate portions of 
her legs.

Tabitha Schulke, 18, began experiencing flu-like symptoms on Thanksgiving morning. Suddenly, her illness worsened and she began developing gangrene on her feet which eventually had to be amputated

Change: Tabitha has accepted now that this is her life and she has to get used to her stumps and go through physical therapy to adapt

Critical care: As she fights for her life in a critical care unit, doctors are beginning to think she may be suffering from toxic shock syndrome, a disease with a 50 percent chance of survival caused by staph infections

Fighting for her life: Doctors told her family that she would die of the mystery illness, as they felt there was little they could do to saver her

Donna had no one to turn to for help. As a single mother she has no partner to share the agonizing decision with.

She wondered if it would be best to let her daughter go, her body was ravaged and she had no idea if she would lapse into a coma or suffer brain damage.

It was the hardest decision of her life.

Tabitha was struck with the mystery infection after delivering food baskets with her church group around Monmouth, a small town near Salem, and got caught in the rain.

Within days the 18-year-old had been rushed to the intensive care unit 
and put on life support and then transferred to Portland's 
Legacy Emanuel Medical Center.

Doctors told her family that she would die of the mystery illness, as they felt there was little they could do to save her.

Mother: Donna Schulke was faced with one of the most difficult decisions of her life - her daughter's life or her limbs

Mystery illness: Tabitha Schulke, 18, began experiencing flu-like symptoms on Thanksgiving morning. Suddenly, her illness worsened and she began developing gangrene on her feet

But a specialized emergency team 
at Legacy Emanuel was able to stabilize her with 'extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation,' a technology that provides support to patients 
whose heart and lungs are severely damaged and cannot function on their 
own.

According to The Oregonian, Donna said goodbye to her daughter 12 times as she suffered from multiple organ failure.

But she knew what she had to do after Tabitha survived every one. She signed the consent form.

Surgeon Andrew Michaels and a team of seven others performed the eight-hour surgery.

'To save her life, we committed her to
a lifetime of disability. Had we done the right thing?' he said. He was
the one who told her about her fate as he 'wanted her forgiveness'.

Survival: Katie Zimmerman, the teen's aunt, said: Just her surviving, that's all that matters. Not Christmas, not anything, just... we want Tabi'

When Tabitha came to and could 
understand what was going on around her, she was delivered the 
heartbreaking news - her left leg was gone six inches below the knee, 
her right leg six inches above the knee.

She was in shock. There were tears, 
questions, denials, phantom pains, confusion and finally acceptance. 
Soon after, Tabitha told her mother she had done the right thing.

After spending 82 days in hospital, the teen was finally allowed to go home last week.

A hospital bed has been put in her living room, her mother carries her daughter up and down the steps.

Donna tells the Oregonian: 'This was 
the hardest choice I ever made. I prayed for guidance because my choice 
was going to change her whole life. I decided that as long as Tabitha's 
spirit is intact she will be fine.

'In many ways,' she says, 'This is a rebirth. When we came home it reminded me of when she was a baby and said her first word.'

On the sofa, Tabitha makes no effort to cover up her stumps, because this is who she is now.
