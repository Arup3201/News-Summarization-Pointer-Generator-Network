A former boyfriend of fashion designer Calvin Klein was arrested Tuesday morning for allegedly stashing cocaine and punching a man he brought home with him after a night on the town.

The 20-year-old victim told police he suffered a cut to the face during an early-morning fight with 22-year-old Nicholas 'Nick' Gruber at his Greenwich Street penthouse.

The victim told the New York Daily News that following the altercation, he considered going home, but decided to call the police instead after seeing blood on his face.

When officers arrived on the scene shortly before 5 am, they said Gruber tried to avoid getting handcuffed by waving his hands in the air.

Police also observed that Gruber shoved his hand down his pants in what appeared to be an attempt to hide something, sources told the Post. 

According to the New York Post, the model and gay porn star was later strip-searched at the 6th Precinct in Manhattan, where police reportedly found cocaine stashed in his underwear.

Gruber was charged with possession of a controlled substance, misdemeanor assault and resisting arrest.

Gruber gained notoriety after being seen at social events in the Hamptons and around Manhattan in Klein's company. 

According to multiple reports, the two dated for nearly two years before seemingly growing apart in January.

Klein, 69, has not publicly acknowledged the relationship with the much younger man.
