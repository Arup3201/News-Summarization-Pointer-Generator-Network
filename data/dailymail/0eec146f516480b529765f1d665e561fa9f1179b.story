For women who like to coordinate their clothes and accessories, there is a new app that lets them match their outfit to absolutely anything.

From a tasty tangerine to a practical paint chart or a clear blue sky, the Snap ColourPop iPhone app lets users search for clothes and shoes in exactly the same colour as any object or inspirational landscape of their choice.

Users of the app take a photograph of their chosen object using their smartphone camera and the app searches for clothes and accessories from 150 UK fashion retailers such as Net-a-Porter, Miss Selfridge and M&S, to find fashion items in exactly the same shade.

From a sweet (pictured)to a practical paint chart or a clear blue sky, the SnapColourPop iPhone app lets users search for clothes and shoes in exactly the same colour as any object or inspirational landscape of their choice

It does this using a specially developed algorithm that combs through over 120,000 products in seconds – depending on your internet connection – to find an exact, or close colour match.

The free app, which launched this week, offers women a quirky way to shop as users can buy their clothing items of choice through the app, which links to retailers’ websites including names like Topshop, Selfridges and New Look.

It claims to match shades of colours as closely as possible to the original photo, which means the app could prove a quick solution for people wanting to find perfectly matching shoes to go with the rest of their outfit.

Users open the Snap ColourPop app and take a picture of an object that they want to use as inspiration for finding a piece of clothing in the same colour.

The app searches though over 120,000 fashion products from over 150 UK fashion retailers to generate matches of the same – or very similar colours.

The results can be browsed by different types of clothing, such as dresses, trousers or shoes.

Items can be purchased immediately via the retailers’ websites or added to a wishlist, which saves results for later.

Users can opt to receive an update if an item in their wishlist drops in price with the app’s ‘sales tracker’ function.

Brides-to-be searching for specific coloured bridesmaids dresses could use the app to match dresses to their bouquet and even find different styles to suit different girls that are in the same shade.

When the fashion items found by the app are displayed, they can be filtered by clothing types, such as dresses or shirts and can either be purchased immediately or saved for later in a ‘wishlist’ which can inform shoppers if the price of the item drops.

Snap ColourPop was designed by 26-year-old computer scientist Jenny Griffiths, CEO and founder of the London-based company, as a way of saving time when shopping.

Ms Griffiths told MailOnline: ‘I think 
there's a need for a new way of searching because there's so much 
fashion online nowadays.

‘Snap ColourPop cuts through all of the 
noise, letting you see products that you know you'll like, and really 
quickly. 

'It's a fun, fast way of discovering fashion online and 
definitely saves valuable time trawling around shops and browsing 
through thousands of items online.’

The app works by using a specially developed algorithm that combs through over 120,000 products in seconds, all based on a photo, which in this example is a can of pringles, to find an exact, or close colour match

The free app, which launched this week, offers shoppers a quirky way to shop - in this case allowing someone to match their trousers to their trophy

The app is the first commercial 
product to use visual search technology to help people shop and Ms 
Griffiths believes it will change the way people buy clothes in the 
future.

She said: ‘Snap ColourPop 
will change the way we shop because it lets us take fashion 
inspiration from anywhere - from catwalk trends to an amazing 
colour that's caught your eye.'

She said the app lets shoppers browse through clothes from different retailers in a quick and efficient way, as it only picks out shades that will match objects or items of clothing already in someone's wardrobe, that the shopper is interested in.

Ms Griffiths is behind another app, 
Snap Fashion, which launched last year and offers a more complex fashion visual 
search tool, where users can select items 
based on their cut, colour and pattern.

She
 came up with the idea after becoming frustrated by searching for
 specific items of clothing by trying to describe them with words and got working on the algorithm herself.

When the fashion items found by the app are displayed, they can be filtered by clothing type such as dress or shirt and can either be purchased immediately or saved for later in a 'wishlist' which also informs shoppers if the price of the item drops

‘You can snap something that you've seen a celebrity wearing through our website and the original Snap Fashion app will find you a similar outfit,’ she said.

‘The first app works well, but I didn’t cater for a situation where you wanted to shop to find something to match the dress that you've just bought, or find something in that colour that you know looks great on you. Snap ColourPop seemed like a really natural thing to develop.’

Snap ColourPop and Snap Fashion available via Apple's App Store and are launching for Android devices in early 2014. A men’s version of Snap Fashion is also due to be released soon.
