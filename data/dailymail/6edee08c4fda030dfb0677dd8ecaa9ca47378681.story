Barbara Walters was completely surprised when Oprah Winfrey was unveiled as one of the surprise guests to come to The View host's farewell show.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Walters' longtime friend Michael Douglas were the two first guests on the show this morning but it was Winfrey who gave the broadcasting legend the biggest surprise.

Walters final show was taped on Thursday but aired on Friday and the only time that the famously steadfast journalist seemed close to tears came when Winfrey began singing her praises.

Emotional moment: The closest Walters ever came to crying during the special was when Winfrey sang her praises and said that she was an inspiration

'Like everyone else, I want to thank you for being a pioneer and everything that that word means,' Winfrey said, gripping Walters' hand across co-host Sherri Shepherd.

Winfrey went on to talk about how Walters had the 'courage' to become the first female co-anchor in spite of widespread criticism and the fact that her co-host openly disliked the fact that he had to share the stage with a woman.

'You're the reason why I wanted to be in television,' she said.Â 

The biggest tribute followed from there, as Winfrey introduced dozens of female broadcast journalists- from Diane Sawyer and Katie Couric to Maria Shriver and Deborah Norville- who came on The View stage as a visual reminder of how Walters led the way for so many women to follow.

'I looked in her eyes that was a real surprise,' Winfrey said of the display after the show wrapped.

The show, which aired this morning, marked the end to Walters' broadcasting career which has spanned more than five decades.

Those who followed: Winfrey took a roll call of the dozens of female broadcasters who came after Barbara was the first woman to have a co-anchor position on television news

Familiar faces: Katie Couric, Savannah Guthrie, Natalie Morales, Tamron Hall, Maria Shriver and Cynthia McFadden were among the women who went to The View set to thank Walters for her inspiration

She said that she will remain an executive producer of The View, the morning talk show she created nearly 18 years ago, but has no specific plans for what she will do now.

During the first segment of this morning's farewell, she turned to Clinton for tips on what to do when taking time off- saying that the 84-year-old reporter should take a real vacation that lasts 'at least a week'.

'You're in no position to tell me to take time off!' Walters joked.

'You
 have a wealth of friends who adore you spend time with them,' the 
former Secretary of State and likely Democratic presidential nominee 
told Walters.

'I can't 
believe this day has come, and I can't believe it's for real,' Clinton 
told Walters, who began her career on NBC's 'Today' in 1962, then came 
to ABC in 1976, where her many duties ranged from co-anchoring '20/20' 
to hosting scores of specials as well as 'The View.'

Typically,
 Walters couldn't let Clinton get away without fielding the question on 
so many minds: Is she running for president in 2016?

'I am running,' smiled Clinton. 'Around the park.'

Run? Waters couldn't help but ask Hillary Clinton if she was going to run in 2016, to which she responded yes, 'around the park'

A bit later, Douglas brought the subject of the 2016 presidential race up again with Walters.

'If Hillary runs,' he said, 'I bet you'd be a great vice president.'

Some of the best moments happened during commercial breaks, never to be seen by viewers.

Then audience members could snap photos and interact with Walters and her co-panelists (Whoopi Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy).

At one point Walters, spying the New York Knicks' J.R. Smith in the stands, broke up the room by telling him that, now, with retirement, 'I just want you to know I'm buying the Clippers.'

The audience erupted at the sight of Winfrey, who told Walters, 'You're the reason I wanted to be in television.'

'You shattered the glass ceiling for so many women,' said Winfrey, who then brought on a startling parade of them, some two dozen prominent on-air women including Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Robin Roberts, Gayle King, Connie Chung and Joan Lunden.

'You are my legacy,' Walters, visibly moved, said to them as they crowded around her onstage.

The hour had its comic twist: In a pre-taped segment, Walters (who, after all, has interviewed everybody else) lobbed some questions at herself, in the person of former 'Saturday Night Live' player Cheri Oteri doing a spot-on Walters imitation.

Barbara asked faux-Barbara what she plans to do in retirement, drawing the response that she means to do some things she never had time for in the past.

For example: 'I'd like to get a Costco card.'

Walters brought the hour to a close with a heartfelt statement looking back with amazement on her career, then signing off with a pledge to 'take a deep breath and enjoy my 'View.'

But a more telling moment took place during a break, as the throng of women she had paved the way for posed with her for a group portrait. It was a remarkable tableau.

'I have to remember this on the bad days,' Walters said quietly, 'because this is the best.'
