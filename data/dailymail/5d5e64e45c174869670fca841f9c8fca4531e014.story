Sunday set to usher in cold spell as weather is drawn in from the wintery east

Wild flowers burst into vivid colour as Spring arrived in its full glory across much of the UK.

The unusually balmy temperatures also brought sun worshipers flocking to the UK's beaches and parks to make the most of the mini heatwave.

And as March brings yet more sunshine and clear sky, data collected by the Met Office looks set to put February as one of the driest on record.

But forecasters have delivered bad news for 
anyone hoping our extraordinary run of unseasonable warmth is set to last.

It 
looks like the Britain will return to more average weather over the weekend.The sunshine will be replaced by the more usual colder, wetter conditions drawn in from the chilly east.

Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: 'This month's weather has really been a tale of two halves. 'Statistically, the UK has seen a remarkably average overall month.

'That's more due to the fact we had a 
very cold first half, followed by an unseasonably warm period. The two 
extremes balanced each other out.

'During
the first half of February, the weather was dominated by a high 
pressure system sitting over the country. This drew in cold, dry weather
from northern Europe.

'The second half was very mild. Most 
of the weather was drawn in from the south west, bringing with it warm 
and damp conditions. But most of the rain fell on high ground and in more northern areas, which has left large parts of the country very dry.'

TODAY:
Dry for most, with cloudy periods and some sunny spells. However, far 
western parts will remain cloudier with occasional drizzle, whilst parts
of Northern Ireland and Scotland should see occasional rain, easing 
later. Remaining generally mild, with light winds.

OVERNIGHT:
Mainly dry, with clear spells perhaps leading to a slight rural grass 
frost. Northern and far western parts will remain rather cloudy, with 
occasional light rain and drizzle.
Friday:

FRIDAY:
Morning rain in Scotland will clear to brighter conditions later. 
Elsewhere it should stay dry with some sunny spells, although southern 
parts will become increasingly cloudy. Breezy in western areas.

SATURDAY TO MONDAY:
Wet and windy conditions will move eastwards over the weekend, 
gradually introducing colder, more unsettled weather, with some wintry 
showers and frosts returning.

He
added: 'But It looks like March will be back to what we'd expect for this 
time of year - cooler temperatures, changeable conditions with rainy 
spells across the entire country. Much more like what we'd expect for the UK in March.'

But the freak weather fluctuations have had a devastating affect on some parts of the country.

Not a single daffodil has bloomed for 
Britain's biggest Daffodil Festival after the big freeze killed off more
than £1 million worth of the flowers across the country.

More
than 10,000 people from all over the UK visit the tiny village of 
Thriplow in Cambridgeshire each year to admire its hosts of golden 
daffodils.

But this year 
there are no brilliant yellow blooms after a winter of topsy-turvy 
weather, which saw temperatures dip as low as minus 12C.

Disappointed visitors, who come by the coach load from across the country, will be greeted by green stems instead of glorious swathes of daffodils.

"The village is normally full of blooming daffodils by St David's Day and the lanes are bright yellow," said David Egleton, 65, from Thriplow.

"But this year the stems are not very high and none have flowered. It's a real shame."

The village of Thriplow, eight miles south of Cambridge, started its famous Daffodil Weekend in April 1969 to raise money to repair its church, St George's.

A number of parishioners opened their gardens to the public and the first event attracted more than 1,500 visitors

In 1976 the villagers planted a massive three tons of daffodil bulbs along the lanes in Thriplow and the incredible sea of yellow began attracting thousands of people.

The tradition has since continued every year except for 2001 because of the foot and mouth outbreak.

It was even held in 1994 when the 
daffodils were buried in an inch of snow. But this year millions of 
daffodils across the UK have been killed off after they bloomed too 
early in January because of mild temperatures, then died in February's 
cold snap.

With frosts 
forecast again for next week there is a worry the world-famous festival 
could still be flower-free on March 17 and 18.

"There
are some in bud ready to go, so we’re keeping our fingers crossed the 
weather stays warm over the next few days. It's always a tense time." 
said Dan Murton, a member of the village's daffodil committee.

Daffodils,
which come in 2,500 varieties, stop growing when temperatures are below
6C. The UK produces half the world's daffodil bulbs, exporting 10,000 
tons a year. Lincolnshire and Cornwall are England's main daffodil 
growing areas.

In 
Cornwall the season can sometimes start in early January, while growers 
in Lincolnshire usually start to pick their flowers at the beginning of 
February.

It is hoped that 
the recent lack of rainfall does not spell disaster for other plant 
growers around the UK. Preliminary data collected by the Met Office 
shows the past month was with the top 15 driest since records began.

All of the UK experienced well below 
average rainfall. Just 62 per cent of the usual precipitation fell 
compared with normal levels.

That was only 53.4mm of the 86.8mm rain 
expected. But regionally there were even more pronounced dry spots with southern and eastern 
England seeing just a third of usual levels.

Rainfall was nearer normal across north-west England and Northern Ireland, 
and above normal across parts of western Scotland.

Even
the snowy and freezing weather from the first half of February did not 
bring with it much water - despite huge dumps of snow.

The lowest temperature reported was a bone-chilling minus 15.6C on February 11, at Holbeach, Lincolnshire.

But
from mid February the freezing cold started to loosen its grip as 
westerly conditions, with an air-stream originating from further south 
in the Atlantic drew in warm air.

Last
Thursday was exceptionally mild - with 18.7C at Coleshill, in 
Warwickshire, making this the warmest February day since 1998. Durham experienced a record-breaking warm day of 17.4C on Tuesday - the highest temperature since data was collected in 1880.

The month's temperatures overall have been near average for the UK - but with a 
pronounced north-west and south-east divide.

February has been a 
sunny month in the south-east, but dull in the north-west and notably 
Northern Ireland. The UK got 96 per cent of overall average expected for this time of year, with East Anglia the brightest region and western Scotland, Northern Ireland, the dullest, with less than 50 per cent.
