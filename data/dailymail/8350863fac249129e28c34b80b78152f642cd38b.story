A football fan is taking his later father's false teeth to his team's Wembley game tomorrow - as an unlikely lucky charm.

Walsall FC supporter Jason Bailey has carried the dentures to every round of the Johnstone Paint Trophy and credits his lucky omen for the club's success this season.

The club now find themselves at Wembley for the first time in their 127 year history and will play Bristol City tomorrow- a week after the 16th anniversary of the death of his father Christopher. 

Walsall FC supporter Jason Bailey has been taking his father's dentures to games since he believed they helped his club to victory at the League Two play-off final in 2001

Jason said: 'This way part of him is there with me at Wembley and his teeth have always been my lucky charm.

'My dad took me my first Walsall game when I was just six-years-old. He was a massive fan but never got to see them achieve much.

'He had a ticket to all the games home and away and worked for them on security on match days. He would loved this moment.

Mr Bailey, 44, began bringing the dentures to matches after he believed they helped his club to victory at the League Two play-off final in 2001.

The superstitious fan even kisses the teeth, wrapped his in his father's favourite handkerchief for good luck. 

'It first came about at the play-off final in 2001 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff,' he added.

'We went 2-1 down in extra time so I got them out in the handkerchief he used to keep them in and gave them a rub and a bit of a kiss. We then went on and won the game 3-2 and I've never looked back.

'I've taken to them to every round of the cup this year - it's the first time I've done that and we're at Wembley for the first time in our history.

'I wish I'd done it sooner. It seems to bring them luck in big games

'Previously I took them major games, such as the play-off final and other cup games against teams in other leagues. More often then not, we win when I've got them.

'I'll definitely give them a little rub and a kiss to help bring us good luck next week - I believe they will do the job and see us to victory.'

Mr Bailey's father Christopher passed away on March 13, 1999 at the age of 49 after he fell into a coma during a triple bypass operation in hospital.

Bus driver Mr Bailey decided to keep his false teeth as a memento because he used to love playing jokes on people in the pub with them.

His father would either drop them in people's pints or put them in bags of pork scratchings as a way of playing pranks on his friends.

'I kept his teeth because they brought back happy memories for me. They were a big part of him,' added Mr Bailey, a father-of-two.

'He used to drop them in people's pints and we used to drink Bank's Mild - it was thick so people wouldn't find them until they got to the end of their pints.

'He would also put them in his pork scratchings and take them back to the bar and complain somebody had left their false teeth inside them.

'He was a bit of a joker to say the least. '

Jason lives in Walsall, West Midlands, with his wife Lisa, 40, and they have two children Jake, 15, and Keenan, 13.

Jake's middle name is Saddler after Walsall's nickname The Saddlers and Keenan's is Ray Graydon, the manager who got them promoted in 2001.

He added: 'The wife weren't too happy with the middle names - but it had to be done.

'She suggested I keep the teeth in her jewellery box as she knows how important they are to me.

'Everyone laughs and think it's a bit strange- but it's my way of saying thank you to him. '

Mrs Bailey, a housewife, added: 'I suggested he keep them in my jewellery box as they are the safest place for them. I know how important the teeth are to him.

'He has banned me from going to Wembley though as, unlike the false teeth, I'm bad luck. Whenever I have gone to watch Walsall, they have lost.

'At first he wanted to name our first born after the whole team. I said no to that. We found a compromise.'
