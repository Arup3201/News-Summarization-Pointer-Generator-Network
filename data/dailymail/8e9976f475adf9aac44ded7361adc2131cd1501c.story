A Las Vegas mother of four shot in the head after a road rage incident that began as she taught her teen daughter to drive has died.

Tammy Meyers, 44, died Saturday days after an attack that left her on life support. She was shot Thursday outside her home after a still-unknown assailant followed her and her 15-year-old daughter before opening fire.

Now her bereaved husband has vowed to find the suspect, and the accomplices who were in the car along with him.

'My word to them is I hope the cops find them first and it’s not me,' Robert Meyers said. 'I have four kids. I just want to let you suspects know you took a mom away.'

Tragic: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in an apparent road rage attack on Thursday

Suspect: A 6-foot man with blond., spiky hair aged around 25 opened fire on Meyers as her children watched. Her 23-year-old son returned fire on the suspect's car which held 'several people' according to reports. Those people remained at large as of Sunday morning

Police believe the shooter followed Tammy Meyers and her youngest daughter home from a school parking lot on Thursday before opening fire.

She died Saturday evening, a family member told ABC News. 

Speaking late Thursday night, the woman's husband, Robert Meyers, said: 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive.

'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.'

However, according to local news station KSNV, Meyers left the life support machines on Thursday night on doctors' advice - who said to keep them active for 48 hours in case she improves.

Mrs Meyers let her daughter take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot when a silver four-door sedan that had been following them passed and hit the brakes, Robert Meyers said.

Vowed to find suspects: Mrs Meyers' husband, Robert Meyers, said his 15-year-old daughter who was driving is distraught. He believes the family's car and that of the suspect crashed at some point before the deadly shooting

She steered around the car and continued driving home. Meyers said she sent their daughter into the house before the shooting. 

He described the girl as emotionally distraught.

Meyers said their adult son emerged from their house and fired several shots with a handgun at the fleeing car.

Meyers said he thinks at least one 9mm shot by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police. 

Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said.

Investigators were looking for the shooter and at least one other person in the vehicle, Garcia said.

Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side. 

'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive,' Robert Meyers told the AP before addressing reporters outside their home (pictured) where the shooting happened about 11:30 p.m. Thursday. 'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back'
