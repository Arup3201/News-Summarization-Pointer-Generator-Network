Aeroplane passengers who sat near the first person in the UK to be diagnosed with a new Sars-like virus have been are being tracked down and tested for the illness. 

The infected man, who travelled back to London at the end of January from Saudi Arabia, later passed the virus on to his son, who died last Sunday in a Birmingham hospital.

The Health Protection  Agency (HPA) has confirmed that passengers who sat in the same row or two rows in front or behind the man on the flight back from Saudi Arabia are being traced.

A spokesperson told MailOnline this was a standard procedure for any type of infectious disease, such as measles or tuberculosis. 

The HPA said it had followed up more than 100 people who had close contact with cases in this family cluster.

'Besides the identified secondary cases, all tests carried out on 
contacts to date have been negative for the novel coronavirus 
infection,' it said.

Family and friends of the affected man are also being traced. A second relative of the first affected man has also been diagnosed with a mild form of the illness but has since recovered.

So far there have only been four confirmed cases of the illness in Britain and 12 anywhere in the world, with six deaths - just one in the UK.

The 39-year-old, who died in the intensive care unit at Birmingham’s 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital, caught the illness from his father, who had 
become infected while travelling in Pakistan and the Middle East.

Healthcare workers who have treated those infected have also been tested and reassured that the risk to their health is 'extremely low' after the relative of a patient died from a Sars-like virus.

The Queen Elizabeth Hospital said last week that the patient's admission had been subject to stringent infection controls.

The illness, known as novel coronavirus, causes a cough, breathing difficulties and fever which can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure.

It is from the same virus family as Sars, which claimed 900 lives worldwide in 2002 and 2003.

But scientists say novel coronavirus is nowhere near as dangerous as it has difficulty spreading between humans.

The man who died on Sunday was suffering from a long-term condition which made him more susceptible.

His father is still being treated at a hospital in Manchester.

Scientists think the illness may be spread via bat droppings or through water droplets from coughs and sneezes.

Professor John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at the HPA, said: ‘This case [the person who died] is a family member who was in close personal contact with the earlier case and who may have been at greater risk of acquiring an infection because of their underlying health condition.

'To date, evidence of person-to-person transmission has been limited. Although this case provides strong evidence for person to person transmission, the risk of infection in most circumstances is still considered to be very low.'
