Manchester City's pre-season campaign got off to a disappointing start as Manuel Pellegrini's side began with a surprise 2-0 defeat to Dundee at Dens Park.

The Premier League champions, who gave debuts to summer signings Fernando and Willy Caballero, looked out of sorts as the Scottish side scored twice in the first half to seal a memorable victory.

Gary Harkins gave the Championship winners the lead on 27 minutes, converting the rebound after Caballero had saved his penalty following a foul by youngster Jason Denayer.

VIDEO New faces on show as City return to action  

Dundee: Adam, Irvine, Mcpake, Trialist, Dyer, Mcbride, Thomson, Trialist, Harkins, Mcalister, Trialist

Subs: Letheren, Davidson, Riley, Macdonald, Roberts, Stewart, Benedictus

Goals: Harkins, Tankulic

Manchester City: Caballero, Bossaerts (Richards 46), Kolarov (Leigh 46), Denayer (Rekik 46), Boyata (Nastasic 46), Navas (Garcia 46), Fernando (Zuculini 46), Rodwell (Nasri 46), Huws, Jovetic (Negredo 46), Guidetti (Sinclair 46)

Trialist Luka Tankulic added a second 11 minutes later, converting a cross from Harkins with the help of a deflection off defender Dedryck Boyata.

This meeting had been eagerly anticipated from the minute it became known City were travelling north to face Paul Hartley's side, who were similarly fresh from their own title conquest at the end of last season.

The visitors have a trio of players still at the World Cup and plenty more recovering from their exploits in Brazil but Pellegrini still sent out a fairly strong side to Tayside which included summer signings Willy Caballero, their new goalkeeper from Malaga and Fernando, their much-vaunted £12m capture from FC Porto, while Spanish winger Jesus Navas and Montenegro striker Stevan Jovetic took their usual places.

They took time to grace the Dens Park surface the night before as fans from both sides rolled up to catch a glimpse of the English champions being put through their paces in the build-up to for this late afternoon kick-off.

There were no prizes at stake for this pre-season encounter which had been billed the champions vs champions but the hosts were buoyed by taking a 27th minute lead.

Harkins was barged inside the box by Denayer and wasted no time in stepping up to take the resultant spot-kick. His effort was saved by Caballero but the former Kilmarnock and St Mirren man did enough to force home the rebound.

Then, on 37 minutes, Dundee had the audacity to go even further ahead. This time Harkins hooked a cross into the box where Tankulic was waiting to send a shot out of the reach of Caballero with the aid of a deflection.

City, not surprisingly, made nine changes at half-time, with another new signing, Bruno Zuculini, also getting his first taste of action since joining Pellegrini's side.

First team stars Samir Nasri, Alvaro Negredo and Matija Nastasic all joined the action at the break, but none could help the visitors mount a second half comeback.

Peter MacDonald, the Dundee substitute, even had a chance to make it 3-0 on 73 minutes as he beat the City offside trap, but his delicate lobbed effort flew just wide.

City continue their tour of Scotland with a game against Hearts at Tynecastle on Friday evening before jetting off to the USA for games against Sporting Kansas City, AC Milan, Liverpool and Olympiacos.
