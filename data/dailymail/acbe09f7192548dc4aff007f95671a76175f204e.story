The Prince of Wales became a royal postman yesterday after he agreed to deliver a well-wisher's card to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with a £10 note enclosed for his 'marvellous' first grandson.

Jubilant royalist Amanda Winney, 49, popped the cash into the card in the hope Kate and William would buy a cuddly toy for their new son, and incredibly Prince Charles took it off her hands.

The incident at the  Royal Welsh Show  in mid Wales, came in a whirlwind 24 hours for the prince, who was in such a hurry to see his son’s first born he raced across the country by helicopter.

Happy day: Prince Charles gets warm congratulations as he meets people at the Royal Welsh Show today, including one woman who asked him to deliver a card and some cash for his first grandchild

Busy few days: The rollercoaster ride to the royal baby's birth led to Charles and Camilla, pictured today, flying to the Lindo Wing by helicopter

Gifts: A member of the public presents Prince Charles with a wonderful Welsh sheep skin rug on a walkabout where he shook hands with many who congratulated him on become a grandfather

Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son out of hospital, but they are yet to decide on a name

In Yorkshire for long-planned public 
engagements, the heir to the throne flew the 240 miles from Leeds to 
London before being rushed to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington in a 
police convoy.

Asked how his first grandchild was as he rushed out of the Lindo Wing 
Prince Charles replied: ‘Marvellous, thank you very much, absolutely 
wonderful,’ and revealed that the baby would be leaving by saying 'you'll see in a minute'.

Today Mrs Winney weaved her way through the throng at the hugely popular Royal Welsh Show to take pole position in the crowd as the Prince passed by.

She then attracted the Prince' attention with a beaming smile as she waved the card in his direction and shouted 'congratulations'.

The Prince was on his way to the annual agricultural event's main show ring after being shown some prize winning cattle.

But he leaned in and spoke to Mrs Winney, who had travelled up from Leominster for the day, talking with her briefly and leaving with the card.

'He took the card, it's absolutely fantastic,' an ecstatic Mrs Winney said.

'It's amazing to meet him. He shouldn't really be here what with the new baby, but duty calls in his case.

'But he took the card and said that he will pass it on, which is fantastic.'

Poking fun: Camilla smiles broadly as Prince 
Charles asks journalists outside St Mary's Hospital: 'Have you been 
there long?' before heading up the steps to meet his first grandchild

Big visit: The proud grandparents stopped and waved to the crowd as they prepared to enter the hospital

She
 said the card, inside a pale blue envelope, depicted a baby in a cradle
 on the front. A crisp new £10 note was slipped inside.

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are spending the day visiting the biggest agricultural show in Europe.

A heavily pregnant mother-to-be who 
has resisted learning the gender of her baby also attracted the 
attention of the Prince of Wales today.

Bethan Davies, 36, got a big surprise when a beaming Charles gave his royal approval to her approach to childbirth.

'He asked me whether I was late and I said no, that I am due on Monday,' said Mrs Davies, from Llangadog in Powys.

'He asked if I knew whether it was a girl or a boy and I said, "No it's going to be a surprise."

'He said that it is nice to be surprised and that they had not known either. They were surprised too.'

The pair both looked in high spirits are they arrived this afternoon to visit the new baby a few hours after the Middletons

Animated: Prince Charles held his hands out as he addressed the media as he climbed out the car outside the London hospital

The mammoth four-day Royal Welsh Show, which was set up over a century ago, attracts at least 200,000 visitors annually.

Based at its own purpose-built ground at Llanelwedd, Builth Wells, the event is a showcase for rural businesses and leisure activity.

The royal couple will take a full tour of the event during their visit, taking in the show's main ring and its large food hall.

This year the Royal Welsh is marking its half century since first moving to its permanent site in mid Wales.

During their tour the royal couple will meet with farmers, members of rural charities, volunteers and local business owners.

Charles, who yesterday described his first grandchild as 'marvellous' after he and Camilla visited the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their new baby in hospital, will also meet an array of people who have benefited from The Prince's Countryside Fund of which he is president.

The fund, set up by his Business in the Community charity, backs projects which support people who care for the countryside.

At the event this year are almost 7,400 entries competing in livestock competitions and there are over 1,030 trade stands.

Thrilled: Kate's parents Carole and Michael smiled broadly as they arrived at hospital to see their daughter and meet their new grandchild

Few words: Carole said the baby was 'absolutely beautiful' and that William and Kate were coping 'fabulously'

Prince Charles had been beaten to the hospital by more than two 
hours by the other set of grandparents, Michael and Carole Middleton. 
But the Palace was keen to stress there was no breach of protocol in 
these modern times.

While the Middletons had remained, on
 tenterhooks, at their £4.8million Georgian mansion in Bucklebury, 
Berkshire, all day on Monday, it was a self-imposed wait to give the new
 parents some time and space together rather than as a result of any 
directive imposed by the Palace.

When they finally arrived in a rather battered black taxi at 3pm yesterday, their smiles lit up the street.
