When bowling fan Jim Cripps was dared to turn his back on the pins, he had no idea that it would take him to the top

Jim, from Tennessee, is the world’s best backwards bowler and holds a Guinness World Record score of 278 points.

It started off as a joke when a friend challenged the 'pretty terrible' bowler to score 150 points with his back turned – and landed a strike on his first bowl.

Pin-and-ball wizard: Jim first tried bowling backwards after a friend dared him and he ended up bowling a strike on his first try

His final score of 163 was just the start and after years of practice he now averages 204 points per game.

‘We never settled up on the bet, but I think I definitely came out the winner of the bet because it truly has been great.’

But it was not just improving his backwards bowling skills which proved a challenge to Jim, many bowling lane operators tried to ban him over his unorthodox methods but he prevailed and videos of him bowling has spread across the globe.

‘I love the sport of bowling & turning around has changed my life as well as given me the opportunity to meet and make friends from all walks of life,’ Mr Cripps writes on his website.

‘From Bowlfest in Las Vegas to Trick shots in Tokyo and all the stops in between, seeing the wonder from both children and adults when you make a shot they thought was impossible is both humbling and awesome.’

What started off as a fun trick has turned into a serious game for Jim, and he has been featured on Good Morning America, Jimmy Kimmel Live and even a Japanese game show.
