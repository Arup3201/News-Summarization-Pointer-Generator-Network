In her first network television interview since she was bitten by an 85-pound Argentinian Mastiff, Denver news anchor Kyle Dyer told the Today show that she made a mistake in leaning into the dog's face.

'I got too close,' Ms Dyer told the Today show's Ann Curry, pointing at the prominent scars on her nose and lips.

‘I think everybody has learned what to 
do around dogs. I thought I was a dog person,’ she said. Ms Dyer had to 
undergo two major reconstructive surgeries and 90 stitches, and may have more surgeries in her future.

Healing process: TV anchor Kyle Dyer admitted on the Today show that she got too close to the 85-pound dog that bit her face

Terrible wound: Dyer underwent two surgeries and had more than 90 stitches to repair the damage

Evidence: When Ann Curry asked if Dyer thought she had made a mistake, Dyer pointed to her face and asked, 'What do you think?'

The Today show’s Ann Curry asked Ms Dyer this morning if she thought she made a mistake in leaning near the dog’s face, looking back with 20/20 hindsight.

‘What do you think?’ Ms Dyer asked, pointing to her heavily scarred face. ’I got too close.’

‘It was just the perfect storm,’ she said on the show. ‘We think we know what dogs are saying but we don’t really know.’

The animal lover told Ms Curry that she’s kept a healthy attitude toward the incident, joking that she’d have to slather on the lip liner to get back her cupid’s bow.

‘I’ll have to work (it) really well,’ she laughed.

‘It was a bad morning, but ever since I got in good hands…I knew it was all going to work out,’ Ms Dyer said. ‘I just feel a lot of love.’

Maximus the mastiff was quarantined for ten days and then released to his owner, which is protocol after a bite.

In good form: TV anchor Kyle Dyer has had two surgeries since she was attacked by a Mastiff February 8 but looks to be healing quickly

Battle scar: A V-shaped scar can be seen on the anchor's top lip, as well as bite marks on her nose and lower lip

Ms Dyer
of Denver’s KUSA-TV gave her first interview two weeks after the attack, bravely showing
scars on her face, which include a V-shaped scar on her upper lip where
skin had to be grafted.

The
anchor told the Denver Post that the first thoughts that went through 
her mind after the Argentine Mastiff bit her was: ‘I’m bleeding, and it 
had to be on television!’

Despite the painful weeks of recovery, two surgeries, and the long road ahead, Ms Dyer said she feels lucky and calls the attack ‘a fluke.’

‘It could have been so much worse,’ she said. She was bitten in the face during a live taping of her show February 8. ‘It may seem like a superficial business, but the people out there in Colorado are not superficial,’ she told the Post.

She said she’s received an outpouring of support from people who have also been bitten by dogs and who are wishing for a speedy recovery.

‘I just keep reading those letters and know that I’m going to heal. I’m going to be better than ever,’ she said.

The news of the attack spread like wildfire around the world. Ms Dyer said she personally witnessed the breadth of the news by way of her niece, who lives in Lithuania.

Attack: In a flash, Max bares his teeth and lashes out at Ms Dyers face. Animal control officers called it a 'pretty major bite.'

Ferocious: Though immediate reports said that he was not properly vaccinated, the owners of the dog have put out a statement saying that he was up-to-date with all of his shots

She said her niece read about the attack in the town’s local newspaper. ‘There’s so many different learning things that have come out of this,’ she said.

She was injured February 8 while doing an on-air segment with the dog’s owner and a fire-fighter who had rescued the Mastiff from an icy pond in suburban Lakewood the day before.

She was petting the dog’s head seconds before it bit her.’

'I know that I’m going to heal. I’m going to be better than ever.'

Over Valentine’s Day weekend, the anchor wrote on her Facebook page that her mouth was stitched shut so the graft over her lips could receive better blood circulation.

While more surgeries may be in her future, Ms Dyer won’t know for certain until this summer, as doctors asses her progress.

Ms Dyer, who had been working at the Denver station for over 15 years, underwent reconstructive surgery and over 70 stitches after the attack.

She said she harbours no ill will toward the dog. ‘It was just an accident,’ she said, saying that she’s glad he is back with his owners.

Struggle: Max the dog was filmed swimming around in an icy pool, unable to escape

A number of viewers expressed 
concern that the dog would be euthanized as a result of the incident, 
which was something they appeared angry about.

'It was clearly human fault. Why should the animal be blamed for both the owner an kyle's mistake?

Argentine mastiffs, also known as the
Argentine Dogo, are known as big-game hunters and historically have 
gone after wild boars and pumas.

While they are now used as pets, they were bred from a rather violent group of dogs. Because of the dogs' violent nature, several areas have banned the breed, including Aurora, Colorado.

Aurora borders Denver, where the broadcast took place. The
animal is also banned in New York City public housing, and laws in the 
UK allow police to take the dogs away from their owners and prosecute 
them.

Hope he isn't put down, it would be a crime,' wrote Bruno Naletto.

Brendan Flynn echoed that sentiment, writing: 'Lord knows 9News will hear from all of us and alot more if Max is put down.'

Unless the dog has rabies - which it is not showing signs of - it will not be put down.

Even if the vaccinations are current, the owners will definitely face two charges from Denver Animal Care and Control: a penalty for having the dog bite someone and a second penalty for having the dog off its leash at the time.

'While we normally walk Max on-leash, we understand that by letting him off-leash in an open area away from anyone was still a mistake. We will never walk him off-leash in public areas after this,' the Robinsons said in their statement.

Max was brought into the studio after the station's news chopper captured 
video footage of a firefighter rescuing Max from a freezing pond Monday 
after he fell through the ice and couldn't make it out.

'I know that she is a great journalist
who loves happy stories - this was a happy story,' her co-anchor Gary 
Shapiro said in a note to fans.

'Kyle was glad she got assigned to it, because she loves animals,' Mr Shapiro said.

Though she is out of the hospital, her recovery is just beginning. Ms Dyer, who is married and has children, is expected to take several weeks to return to work.

'She's
doing well, and will make a recovery, and we're all thinking about her 
and her family,' said 9News vice president Patti Dennis.

'Kyle-
of all people!- is the biggest dog lover and even yesterday we were 
talking about how, as dog lovers, we think every dog belongs to us.

'Kyle will be back in a period of weeks- probably several but she will be back.'
