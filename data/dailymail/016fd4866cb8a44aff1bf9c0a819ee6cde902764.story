Nipping to the loo may not be your normal idea of a romantic getaway... but at £100k these public toilets are a seaside hideaway fit for a future king.

The former restrooms, which have just come on the market for redevelopment, are just a short drive from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s former secret home on Anglesey.

The toilets, in a “stunning seafront location”, are just 20 miles from the love nest the couple called home for their first years of marriage.

The public toilets come with a stunning view of the north Welsh coast which William and Kate, inset, enjoyed for the three years they lived on Anglesey

The buildings come with planning permission and are ready to be transformed into a dream house like the secluded Anglesey farmhouse William and Kate have recently moved from after three years.

But buyers will have to spend more than a penny to land their dream home, the property is expected to fetch between £80,000 and £100,000.

Gareth Williams, estate agent at Dafydd Hardy, said: “This is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and site of scientific interest, and one of the best places in the UK for wildlife.

“It’s a great opportunity for a developer, someone needing a home, or a buyer looking for a holiday cottage investment in a location without equal.

“We use the word “unique” a lot - but it genuinely applies here.”

There is permission to convert the stone building into a two-bedroom home, with space for gardens, parking, and sweeping sea views.

Vacant: The former toilets, which are currently empty, could be turned into a dream bolthole.

In need of repair: the former public restrooms will be in need of some work if they are to come close to the Duke and Duchess' former royal retreat.

The toilets boast panoramic views of Anglesey’s western coast to Snowdonia and down the Lln Peninsula and Bardsey island.

The public convenience was closed by the local authority last year as part of a closure programme to save more than £30,000 a year.
