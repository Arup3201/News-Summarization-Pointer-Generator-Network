A woman who wanted bigger breasts so she could 'feel like one of the girls' was left with a lopsided, swollen cleavage after going under the knife. 

Support worker Susan Calvert, 39, from Sunderland, had a boob job in her early twenties and was told her implants would 'last a lifetime'.

Explaining why she wanted surgery in the first place, she said: 'All my friends had bigger boobs. I would put something on and I 
would look like a boy.'

Desperate to be bigger: Susan Calvert wanted larger breasts so she could feel more like 'one of the girls'

Before: Flat-chested Susan said she felt like a boy

After: She was initially pleased with her bigger bust - but years later the implants ruptured

'You don't feel like one of the girls when you 
don't have big boobs. I got to the point where I had to have something 
done.'

After having an operation to boost her bust size, Susan was initially happy with the results.

However, the look she was promised would last a lifetime only in fact lasted 15 years - after which time the implants ruptured leaving her with painful, swollen breasts.

Susan shares her story on Botched Up Bodies, the Channel 5 series that returns to TV screens evening.

Plastic surgery is booming in the UK, with hundreds of thousands of operations performed and millions of pounds spent.

This has also led to a rise in bogus practices and botched operations like that experienced by Susan.

She said: 'I didn't do any research. I just 
wanted to get them done and have lovely boobs. I was told once they 
were in they were in for life.

Susan and her partner travelled to London to see if the surgeons on Channel 5's Botched Up Bodies could repair the damage from her first operation

Result: The surgeons replaced her ruptured implants with new ones that left her with a perky, painfree chest

'But they started to feel really hard 
and I got discoloration and bruising under the breasts. When I went to 
hospital, I was told the implants had ruptured and the silicone was leaking and the 
only treatment was removal.'

The Channel 5 documentary series follows Britain’s top plastic surgeons as they work to repair surgical disasters.

Despite her previous problems, Susan decided she didn't want to give up having bigger breasts for good so asked the doctors to remove and replace her implants.

She shows off the results in tonight's episode, which also follows 49-year-old Stephen Dockrell as he seeks to be free of the huge sack of excess skin left after a gastric bypass.

Meanwhile Darren Mills, a 44-year-old scaffolder from Bristol, needs help to repair his managed mouth after a trip to Asia to get a perfect smile left him with terrible teeth.

Series Two of Botched Up Bodies begins on Channel 5 at 9pm, Monday, 22 July
