Saved: A crew member prepares to help a stranded woman leave her flooded Staten Island home

Helping others: Video of the rescue crew's heroic actions on Staten Island was today made available on the department's YouTube channel

The chopper involved in the rescue is known as Helicopter 23, after the number of NYPD officers killed on 9/11

The dramatic footage shows one helicopter crew winching six people, including a child, to safety from an environment left submerged in muddy water.

The chopper, named Helicopter 23 
after the number of NYPD officers killed on 9/11, performed rooftop 
rescues as another helicopter hovered nearby filming the scene.

Members of the department's Aviation 
and Scuba division, the men rescued five adults and one child, all 
trapped on the rooftops of their houses due to rising waters.

It today emerged that a 13-year-old girl was killed on Staten Island when Sandy reduced her house to splinters.

Angela Dresch was found dead, her 
mother is in a critical condition and her father is still missing after 
the small house was washed away.

Back on dry land: Helicopter 23 dropped off its passengers in a nearby car park where first aid and other assistance was provided

Only the foundation, splintered 
debris and two shrubs were left at her home near the water’s edge in the
Tottenville neighborhood.

The Staten Island Advance reports 
that Angela’s family was one of the few on her street to stay in their 
homes and try to wait out the storm. Their house was in one of the 
city’s mandatory evacuation zones.

Neighbors said the family left for 
Tropical Storm Irene last year and returned to find their house had been
looted. They did not want a repeat of that experience, the Advance 
reported.

The neighborhood sits in a low-lying part of Staten Island, just feet from the shore.

It was no match for the 13ft storm surge that the superstorm brought to New York on Monday night.
