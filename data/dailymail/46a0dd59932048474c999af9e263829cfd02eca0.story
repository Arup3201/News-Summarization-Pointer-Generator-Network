Sudden loss: Kirk Urso #15 of the Columbus Crew has unexpectedly died at the age of 22

Columbus Crew midfielder Kirk Urso died early Sunday morning at a central Ohio hospital without a cause of death known, a county coroner said.

Urso, 22, was rushed by ambulance from a downtown Columbus bar to the Grant medical center at 12.50am where he was pronounced dead at 1.50am, The Columbus Dispatch reports.

An autopsy is scheduled for Monday, Franklin County Coroner Dr. Jan Gorniak said.

Urso played in six games this season 
and was sidelined by groin surgery in May. Urso was not with the team 
Saturday for its 1-0 loss to D.C. United in Washington, team spokesman 
Marco Rosa said.

The team withheld detailed comment, and the hospital said privacy laws ruled out any comment.

'The
thoughts and prayers of the entire Columbus Crew and Hunt Sports Group 
are with the Urso family in this time of need,' a team statement said.

Urso's
roommate and fellow rookie Ethan Finlay, 21, described to the Dispatch 
the friend he met at the age of 14 at a regional camp.

'The thing that stood out to me was how 
good he was but also how humble and friendly he was,' Finlay told the 
Dispatch in a statement.

'He had a great sense of humor, one that could brighten even the saddest of days. He was a one-of-a-kind and that's why I'm going to miss him.'

Urso was in his first season with the Crew. In a team profile last month of Crew rookies, he said he was frustrated with injuries.

'To go from getting picked up late in 
the draft, to starting and contributing, and then to be out completely 
and hurt — it's really frustrating. Injuries are just a part of 
(soccer),' he said.

A native of Lombard, Ill., Urso played on North Carolina's NCAA title-winning team last fall and for the U.S. under-17 World Cup team in 2007.

With the NCAA title, Urso said it helped erase years of frustration for him and the other UNC seniors.

'My whole college career has been awesome, but there was something extra about this team,' Urso said. 'To cap it off with this is something I'm going to remember the rest of my life.'
