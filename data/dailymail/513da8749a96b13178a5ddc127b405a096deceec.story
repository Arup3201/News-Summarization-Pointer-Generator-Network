Rupture: Rebecca Van Hooser said the officer threw her against her car when he arrested her during a traffic stop on Bowen Road

A Texas woman has filed a lawsuit claiming that one of her breast implants ruptured because a police officer used excessive force during her arrest last year.

Rebecca Van Hooser, a litigation paralegal from Arlington, said that the injury at the hands of Pantego officer Eric Alvarez caused serious health complications that she has been dealing with ever since. 

According to Van Hooser's attorney, Susan Hutchinson, her client was pulled over on Bowen Road on October 28, 2011, for driving with her headlights off after dark - an accusation she disputes.

Van Hooser was then arrested for having a warrant out for an unpaid speeding ticket.

As the woman was being taken into custody, her lawyer claim that officer Alvarez slammed her body against the car, spread her legs and roughly pulled her arms far behind her back to put on the handcuffs, according to NBC 5.

In the process, Hutchinson said an implant in her client's right breast had burst.

According to the suit, Van Hooser screamed out in pain, telling the officer that she had undergone spinal surgery in 2008 and tried to show him her scar.

The lawsuit filed against the town of Pantego and the local police department goes on to state that the woman was in such agony that she begged for help and began to lose all feeling in her arms.

In response, Alvarez allegedly told her, 'You're not supposed to be comfortable.'

Van Hooser was then put into a squad car, where she told a second officer about her pain and surgery.

The cops eventually relented and handcuffed the woman in the front before hauling her off to jail, Fox 4 reported. 

In the aftermath of the arrest, Hutchinson said Van Hooser suffered two hematomas and had to undergo four surgeries.

She will also have to have a partial mastectomy, tissue transplant and have a new implant inserted.

Pantego officials said the town has complete faith in its police force.

The town said its officers always conduct themselves in the most professional manner.

The police department responded to the lawsuit by dismissing Van Hooser’s excessive force claims.

‘Our preliminary investigation shows there is not merit to the allegations,’ Police Chief Thomas Griffith said in a statement.
