Under a full moon in the Caucasus, Martin O’Neill was entitled to howl with elation as the Republic of Ireland did what their manager does on match day – they came alive.

No one responded greater to O’Neill’s demand for an extra 10 per cent than Aiden McGeady whose two-goal contribution was the act of deliverance he has long threatened to provide in an Irish jersey.

On his 70th appearance, McGeady struck with a glorious 90th minute match-winner, engineered and executed by his twinkling toes and rising self-belief.

No one goes back longer with O’Neill than McGeady and it was fitting the Glaswegian should ensure a winning Euro 2016 start for his former Celtic manager.

Confronted by a wall of white as he gathered possession on the edge of the box, McGeady’s shoulder dip sent half the Georgian defence into the nearby River Kura, and created sufficient space to curl a lovely left footer into the far corner.

On the touchline, O’Neill soared skywards, beside him Roy Keane and Robbie Keane, who had been substituted, were wrapped in each other arms.

In the colourful history of Irish football, it’s a rare event for the senior team to score a last-gasp winner, especially on foreign turf.

This win, hard-earned but deserved, was sweet and it sets the Irish up for a six-point start to Group D – they play Gibraltar next – before the trip to Germany on October 14.

Predictably, the Georgians were gung-ho early on, eager to remind the Irish what they missed six years ago when the World Cup qualifier was shifted to neutral Mainz.

But their early fizz couldn’t mask their limitations and Ireland, all verve and vigour, controlled most of the play.

As the Georgians perhaps scented a weakness, they lowered their guard and were caught squarely on the chin in the 24rd minute as McGeady made his first telling input.

From Forde’s deep clearance, Jon Walters headed down to Keane who allowed the ball run into the path of James McCarthy.

The option to shoot was there but McCarthy, aware McGeady was up in support to the left, deftly he laid the ball off for his Everton comrade to slip the ball calmly under Loria.

On the bench, O’Neill and Keane sprang to their feet, the tensions uncoiled and they embraced.

The goal should have been the cue for Ireland to kick on and consolidate.

But seven minutes before half-time, their jaws dropped as Georgia conjured up an improbable equaliser from the right-foot of Tomike Okriashvili.

The second half unfolded as predicted with McGeady at the hub of Ireland’s most creative efforts.

He curled a free-kick a whisker wide, went close with a right-stinging right-footer and worked the substitute ‘keeper, Roin Kvaskhvadze as he peppered in crosses.

For the final 15 minutes, Ireland pressed for a winner as Georgia bedded down to for a draw which seemed likely until Seamus Coleman found McGeady and the wee man’s magic did the rest.
