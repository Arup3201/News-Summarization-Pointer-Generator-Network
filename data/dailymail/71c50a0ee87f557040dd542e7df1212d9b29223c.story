The 20-year-old man who police say went to an Atlanta-area school heavily armed and exchanged gunfire with officers before surrendering was a normal kid growing up, but began to change as a teenager and engage in behavior that was threatening to others, his brother said.

Tim Hill, 22, told CNN's Piers Morgan on Thursday that when he and Michael Brandon Hill were growing up, he was 'like any other kid,' playing outside and in the woods.

But he said that as Michael Hill got older, his violent and erratic behavior began to escalate, and that as a teen he had once tried to burn down the family home with eight people asleep inside, threatened to stab his mother and threatened to kill his brother.

Tim Hill said, 'Once he started 
hitting his teenage years, something happened with him. Everything just 
started changing after doctors started messing with his medicines here 
and there, and changing them up and putting him on a different one and 
institutionalizing him multiple times to correct his medicine. It just 
escalated from there.'

He said Michael Hill set fire to the family's home when eight people 
were inside sleeping - the fire was discovered before it spread - and at
another point their mother awoke to find him standing over her with a 
butcher's knife.

'My stepfather and mother ended up having to 
lock up... like all the knives in the trunk of the car, just to protect 
everybody in the home,' Tim Hill told Morgan.

Tim Hill also 
confirmed that his brother threatened his life on Facebook, prompting 
him to call police. He said he feared for his life.

The older 
brother's comments came two days after a school bookkeeper helped 
persuade Michael Hill to surrender to police following a frightening 
standoff and shooting Tuesday at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning 
Academy in Decatur, a suburb east of Atlanta.

Police and school 
officials said that school bookkeeper Antoinette Tuff helped avert a 
tragedy after she was taken captive by Hill. He went to the school armed
with an AK 47-style rifle and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition, police 
said.

Lines of young students raced out of the building with 
police and teachers escorting them to safety, recalling the chaotic 
scene last December outside a Connecticut elementary school, where a 
gunman killed 20 students and six educators.

On a recording of a 
911 call released Wednesday, Tuff can be heard relaying messages from 
Hill to DeKalb County emergency dispatcher Kendra McCray before 
convincing the gunman to surrender. She tells the dispatcher that Hill 
said he wasn't there to hurt the children but wanted to talk to an 
unarmed officer.

'He said, "Call the probation office in DeKalb County and let them know 
what's going on,"' Tuff is heard telling the dispatcher. 'He said he 
should have just went to the mental hospital instead of doing this, 
because he's not on his medication.'

No one was injured, but 
police said the suspect shot into the floor and exchanged gunfire with 
officers who had surrounded the school, which has 870 students in 
pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. With bullets flying, Tuff urged 
him to come back inside and give up.

'I knew [police] were gonna 
kill him. And I knew he was not in his right state of mind,' she told 
CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night.

On the program, she had a
tearful on-air reunion with McCray, the dispatcher who stayed on the 
phone with her as she reassured Hill that surrendering peacefully was 
the right thing to do.

Tuff also received a call in the network's makeup
room from President Barack Obama. She said Obama wanted her to know how
proud he was of her.

'You can't get any better when you have a great leader in front of you,' a beaming Tuff is shown telling the president.

Time and again, Tuff stressed that her faith got her through the episode.

'That was nobody but God's grace and mercy, because I can truly tell you I was terrified inside,' she said.

She said she was praying the entire time she talked with Hill, asking God what she should say.

McCray said she was frightened, too, particularly when Tuff began telling her Hill was getting agitated.

'I had to put my phone on mute [and say], "Hey, he's getting agitated. We have got to move."'

Tuff
is 'a true hero,' McCray said on the program.

'You did so great. I've 
never had a caller where the caller was so calm and so confident in what
they were saying and so personable. You made my job a whole lot 
easier.'

Hill is charged with aggravated assault on a police 
officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted 
felon. Police declined to discuss what he told them when questioned.

Antoinette Tuff said: 'And I just explained to him that I loved him. I didn't know much about him. I didn't know his name but I did love him and it was scary because I knew at that moment he was ready to take my life along with his'

Police on Wednesday released an undated photo of Hill posing with an 
assault rifle that they believe is the one used at the school.

Authorities
said Hill got the gun from an acquaintance, but it's not clear if he 
stole it or had permission to take it. His motive is still unclear.

Tim
Hill expressed frustration that authorities hadn't done more to deal 
with his brother's mental condition before Tuesday. He said he doesn't 
believe his brother would have harmed Tuff or the schoolchildren.

'I don't think he was there to do that,' Tim Hill said of his brother. 'He's always had a problem with the cops.'

Tuff told Cooper she'd like to visit Hill and speak with him again.

'He's
a hurting soul, and so if there's any kind of way I can help him and 
allow him to get on the right path - we all go through something,' she 
said during the interview.

Hill's brother said on Tuesday that he was 'bound to do something stupid'.

Timothy Hill told ABC News: 'I honestly can tell you he has got a long history
of medical disorders, including bipolar, and that could make you snap 
on a dime.

Tim Hill said he is not close to his brother and last saw him in January 2011.

He did not reveal exactly what his 
mental health issue but said he was taking drugs for attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder since he was six-years-old.

'I had a feeling he was going to 
eventually, one day, do something stupid, but not of this magnitude,' he
said, adding that his brother had once threatened to kill him.
