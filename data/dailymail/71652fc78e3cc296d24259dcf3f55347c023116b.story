Three men involved in a deadly terrorist attack on the Presidential Palace in Mogadishu have been executed by a firing squad.

The men, all members of al-Qaeda linked al-Shabab, had been found guilty of killing civilians and masterminding the July attack, and were sentenced to death by a Somali military court.

The attack on July 5 saw al-Shabab insurgents attack the presidential palace with guns and bombs while President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was away.

The militants entered the presidential palace by placing a car bomb near the entrance to the compound, after which the militants attacked from two directions, officials said at the time.

A spokesman from al-Shabab said 14 government soldiers were killed, while a security official later added that nine attackers involved in the raid had been taken out.

The images of the execution emerge as a roadside bomb detonated in a busy market in the Somali capital, killing three women, and wounding seven others.

It was not immediately clear who was behind the bombing, but it is possible it was a retaliation for the execution of the three al-Shabab fighters.

The women killed in the blast were city workers, who were cleaning the streets when a bomb hidden in a rubbish pit exploded in the busy market sector known as Hodan district of Mogadishu, police said.

‘We heard a big blast, and then I could see the old mothers who were cleaning the scene lying, some of them dead and others screaming.

'The bomb was wrapped in a big, black plastic bag and then placed inside the rubbish along the Taleh street,’ Nuria Ahmed, a mother of four who lives near the scene, said.

‘I counted three dead and seven others injured. I was the first person who arrived for help. It is very unfortunate if mothers are the target.’

‘A remotely controlled roadside bomb killed three female city cleaners and injured seven others in Hodan district. The militants hid the bomb inside a rubbish pit,’ Major Ali Afrah, a police officer said.

African Union forces along with the Somali army launched a new offensive this year against al-Shabab, which is fighting to impose a harsh version of Islamic law on Somalia.

Several towns have been taken back from the group, but officials say the Islamists still control large sections of countryside and some settlements, from where they have been able to continue their guerrilla-style campaign.

The militants have also staged attacks outside Somalia, including one at a Kenyan shopping mall in September that killed at least 67 people.
