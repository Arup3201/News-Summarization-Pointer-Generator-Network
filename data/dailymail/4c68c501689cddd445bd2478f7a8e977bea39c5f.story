Paul Pogba's cousin has posted a video of the Juventus midfielder showing the kind of moves that could make him a hit on the dance floor as well as the football pitch.

On Friday, France international Pogba was shortlisted for the young player of the 2014 World Cup award alongside countryman Raphael Varane and Holland's Memphis Depay.

The 21-year-old added to his burgeoning reputation with assured displays in the middle of France's midfield as they reached the quarter-finals before losing to Germany.

In the video Pogba showed the kind of movement that sees him accelerate past defenders with ease to set up attacking moves for club and country.

And he is cheered on by a room full of family and friends as he shows off his finest dance moves.

On his Instagram page, FemFel, Pogba's cousin, posted the video alongside the message: 'All the rumours about #Pogba being in london meeting #ChelseaFC. Well to clear up the rumours this is what he was really doing here. #familydisco skanking'.

Pogba was spotted near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium earlier this week sparking rumours that he could be set to leave the Italian champions for a return to the Premier League.

He left Manchester United in 2012 after becoming frustrated at a lack of first-team opportunities and joined Juventus where he has since won two Serie A titles.

Pogba was part of the France side that won the 2013 Under-20 World Cup alongside Real Madrid's Varane, Chelsea's Kurt Zouma and Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo.

He was recently seen playing computer game Football Manager as Chelsea and choosing himself to play in midfield alongside Frank Lampard.
