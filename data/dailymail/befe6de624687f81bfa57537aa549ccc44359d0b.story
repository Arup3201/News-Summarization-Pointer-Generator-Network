A wheelchair-bound council equalities adviser who arranged to have sex with a five-year-old girl and her mother at a Travelodge has been jailed for two-and-a-half years today.

Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, 59, bragged online that he loves to ‘have kids play with me’ as he arranged to meet the mother, who was actually an undercover police officer.

The Westminster Council officer was arrested by waiting police at Victoria Station in central London with condoms, a box of 
Smarties, a colouring book and train tickets to Maidstone, Kent.

Prison: Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, who suffers from muscular dystrophy, was jailed for two-and-a-half years today

Covert officer ‘Jo’ made contact with 
Holdsworth-Wild through the True Nudist website, as he sought out sex 
with her fictional daughter ‘Chloe’, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The conversations then moved to an MSN 
forum where he said he enjoyed getting naked with his imaginary 
‘daughter’ and liked ‘playing, having sex and sexy times’.

Holdsworth-Wild also said he would ‘love to play with a family’ and made incestuous suggestions to Jo.

Holdsworth-Wild, Truro, 
Cornwall, who has muscular dystrophy, wept 
as he was jailed today and begged not to be handcuffed to a dock officer
 as he was led from the court to begin his sentence.

He had denied a single count of arranging or facilitating the 
commission of a child sex offence but was convicted after a retrial.

Gregory Fishwick, for Holdsworth-Wild, tried to persuade the judge to pass a suspended prison sentence, adding: ‘It is a simple example that for this man, life with a custody sentence would affect him far greater than any other sort of defendant.’

But Judge John Price said an immediate jail sentence was the only way of dealing with Holdsworth-Wild.

‘I have no doubt he intended, had he been able to do so, to commit the act’, he said.

‘There are powerful points of mitigation, but in my judgement it has to be an immediate custody sentence.'

He was arrested at Victoria Station and he was carrying condoms, a colouring book and Smarties

Holdsworth-Wild was convicted after a retrial in April of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, nearly two years after his arrest on July 21, 2011.

He was sacked from his position as inclusion and access officer after an internal probe by the council.

He also admitted possessing a level one indecent image of a child at the start of his original trial in August 2012.

Prosecutor James Norman said: ‘This case is, in short, about the defendant’s efforts to have sex with a five-year-old girl.

‘Between February and July, 2011, he made arrangements to have a sexual encounter with a five-year-old girl called Chloe and her mother, Jo.

‘On July 21, he went to Victoria Station to meet Jo and Chloe and was going to take them to a Travelodge in Kent where he stayed for work.

‘He brought a box of condoms and while he waited for them to arrive, he also bought a box of Smarties and a colouring book.

‘Fortunately Chloe does not exist and Jo is an undercover police officer.

‘The only people who met him (at Victoria) were other police officers who arrested him.

‘The defendant intentionally arranged to have a sexual encounter with Chloe, a five-year-old girl.’

Holdsworth-Wild admitted the online conversations, but claimed during it was merely a fantasy that he never intended to go through with.

A covert internet investigator called ‘Gary’ was deployed to the True Nudist website to snare paedophiles on May 22, 2011, Mr Norman said.

‘He then suggested moving the conversation to MSN. From that point onwards, unbeknown to Mr Holdsworth-Wild, the conversation was being recorded by police.’

Mr Fishwick said he was suffering depression and coping with debt problems in a ‘lonely’ existence away from his wife at the time of the offence.

‘He was in effect living a lonely life in a motel in Maidstone’, he said.

‘Those potential triggers no longer exist for this man.’

He said Holdsworth-Wild is still saddled with £50,000 of debt and living off benefits, while he and his wife care for each other.

He will be under a 12-year sex offences prevention order when he is released from prison.
