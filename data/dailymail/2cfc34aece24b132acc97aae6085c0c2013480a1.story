Taken in the darkness of night, a Western Australian photographer has managed to capture the stunning stars along the state's coast line.

Michael Goh - a self-taught astrophotographer - travelled to Namburg National Park, almost 200km north of Perth, to capture his award-winning pictures.

One of the photos show the movement of the stars in the sky as the earth rotates, creating a concentric circle effect above the national park's limestone formations called The Pinnacles.

The light from the moon and stars casts haunting shadows over the natural rock structures.

In one image a lone man stands with a single illumination source and highlights his singularity, casting a shadow across the sandy grounds of the park.

Goh, a Perth father-of-two, specialises in astrophotography and often spends the whole night out in in the elements trying to get the perfect shots of the shifting night sky.

And his efforts have paid off, with his photographs winning a number of accolades at Australia's photography festival Astrofest held at Curtain University.

'It is important to enjoy the moment as well as take the pictures and luckily a lot of my astrophotography lets me sit back while I capture the shots,' Goh said.

He said he was constantly competing with the weather to grab the perfect shot, so he was always ready to go with his camera at the first sign of a clear night sky.
