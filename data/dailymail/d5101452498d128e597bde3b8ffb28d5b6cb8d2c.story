The man who produced the thank you note that brought down a New South Wales premier has revealed how it almost did not happen.

Former Australian Water Holdings (AWH) chief Nick Di Girolamo said he had contemplated burning the note after Premier Barry O'Farrell denied he had received a $3,000 bottle of Penfolds Grange Hermitage from Mr Di Girolamo who has links with the family of Eddie Obeid, a corrupt former politician.

Mr O'Farrell was appearing as a witness before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on April 15.

Former chief of Australian Water Holdings Nick Di Girolamo was the man who brought down the premier with a thank you note for a bottle of wine

While giving evidence, Mr O'Farrell said he and his wife Rosemary had been on holidays in April 2011 when it was asserted the wine had been delivered to their Roseville home on Sydney's north shore.

But the ICAC traced a telephone call from Mr O'Farrell to Mr Di Giromalo around that time.

On the same night Mr O'Farrell took the stand, Mr Di Girolamo found a note penned in 2011 by the then-premier thanking him and his wife, Jodie, for the bottle of wine.

In his home office, the businessman contemplated whether or not he would burn the note or front up and hand it over to his legal team.

'It would have been illegal, but at that moment I was not thinking like a lawyer,' Mr Di Girolamo told The Daily Telegraph.

'I was all over the place.

'I knew it was a perversion of justice, and still there was a small voice in my head asking, "Should we have a bonfire session?"'

After mulling it over - and despite the consequences he would later face for dobbing in the premier - he knew what he had to do.

The next day Mr O'Farrell's lawyers received a copy of the note Mr Di Girolamo had found and within hours NSW's most powerful man resigned from his post.

He also revealed he had received death threats on March 18 and 23, which was the first week of the ICAC hearing, according to The Daily Telegraph.

In one of the calls, someone called from a blocked phone number while he was at home, saying: 'You're dead, you piece of shit.'

Five Dock funeral director Andrew Valerio was charged a few weeks later with using a carriage service to menace/harass/offend.

Despite doing the right thing, Mr Di Girolamo struggles with the decision he made, telling The Daily Telegraph he wanted to apologise for the outcome of his discovery.

'It causes me great angst that I’ve in any way, shape or form forced the premier to resign,' he said.

'I’ve thought about reaching out. I suppose what has stopped me is the fear that I won’t get a great reception from the other end.'

The note was produced to Mr Di Girolamo's lawyers and then given to Mr O'Farrell on the same day the premier resigned

When Mr O'Farrell tendered his resignation, he said he still did not recall receiving the bottle of wine, but 'he did accept there was a thank you note signed by me'.

'As someone who believes in accountability and responsibility, I accept the consequences of my actions,' he told media.

'The evidence I gave [at ICAC] was evidence to the best of my knowledge.

'I believed it to be truthful.'

ICAC was investigating allegations Eddie Obeid's family covered up their investment in AWH when they were trying to win a contract with Sydney Water that would have made the Obeids $60 million, according to Business Insider Australia.
