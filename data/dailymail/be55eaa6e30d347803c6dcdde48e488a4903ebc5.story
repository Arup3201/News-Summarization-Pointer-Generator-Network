Growing out bangs can be a tedious process that can leave one with months of bad hair days. Not for Michelle Obama though, who has been using headbands made from hosiery to keep her locks in place.

The $46 headbands made from stretchy 97 per cent nylon and 3 per cent elastane, come from luxury label Wolford.

The brand's style and fit expert, Jenny Altman, told WWD that Mrs Obama has long been a fan of the Fatal headbands.

Looking polished: Michelle Obama is a huge fan of the Wolford Fatal headbands and has even had the label customize them for her with crystals and exclusive colorways

Fringe benefit: The Wolford headband appears to 
be helping the first lady (pictured boarding Air Force One in Miami, 
Florida, on March 9 and on Christmas Day 2013 in Kaneohe, Hawaii) grow 
out her bangs in style

Indeed we have seen her wear them on 
several occasions of late, including last month, while boarding Air 
Force One in Miami, Florida, and on Christmas Day 2013 in Kaneohe, Hawaii, on a 
visit to a Marine Corps base.

She one when she was pictured speaking to children across the country on Christmas Eve as part of the annual NORAD Tracks Santa program, and again at a yoga class in Miami on February 25.

I'm all for designer accessories, but I had never considered the basic headband a luxury item.

Then again, I had never considered wearing one outside of the gym.

This is no ordinary headband though. Like Wolford tights, it is very soft, stretchy and machine washable.

The black is an inky hue that won't fade with wear, and it doesn't slide out of place on the head - highly annoying during a spin class.

Is it worth $46 though? I'm not sure it is. It's a small amount of fabric given that a whole pair of Wolford Velvet de Luxe 66 denier tights (94% nylon and 6% elastane) costs a dollar less.

'Michelle Obama likes to wear the 
headbands when she’s traveling because it’s so easy to just pull your 
hair back and look stylish,' Ms Altman revealed.

Now Wolford has been working with Mrs 
Obama's styling team on customizing the bands in a wider selection of 
colors and decorating them with crystals.

While the brand only sells plain black and white bands on its website and in its stores, Mrs Obama now has 'sparkle' versions in black, mocha, pine needle green, gray and marlin blue.

A representative for the label said: 'As per her request, we custom-made jeweled headbands for Michelle 
Obama in a variety of colors in December 2013.'

Those wishing to get their hands on a sparkly version, though, will have to stick on the crystals themselves.

'The jeweled 
headbands are not available for purchase at this time,' she said.
