Starbucks has apologized to a 24-year-old woman who said she wasn't allowed in a Rochester-area store because she had a service dog.

Amy Kaplan of suburban Brighton said she was denied service after entering a Starbucks on Sunday afternoon with her service dog, a malamute named Zero.

Kaplan suffered a traumatic brain injury in a traffic accident, and the dog helps her cope with memory issues and anxiety

Friendship and support: Amy Kaplan and Zero the malamute were turned away from their Rochester, New York

Kaplan posted a video to YouTube of her experience at the Twelve Corners Starbucks in New York where server, Bill Kuhns, tells her to she has to leave.

Asking him why she has to leave with Zero, Kaplan says, 'Are you denying me access because of my service dog?'

Kuhns replies, 'No, I'm not. I'm tellin you that you cannot come in with your service dog.'

Kaplan told the Democrat and Chronicle that she stepped into the coffee store around 3pm on Sunday with Zero, who she needs after suffering a traumatic brain injury after a crash that occurred between a bus and the ambulance she was in working as a paramedic.

Zero is trained to help Kaplan with memory issues which resulted after her head injury which left her unable to remember where she has parked her car or where she lives.

Legally, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires all businesses to allow service animals inside.

However, the business is allowed to ask why the animal is needed, but owners do not need to produce written proof they need it.

The Starbucks employee objected to Kaplan's service animal because he thought she did not need it and because she had no documentation.

Kaplan said this is a common problem.

'This is a part of daily life when you're a service dog handler,' Kaplan said to the Democrat and Chronicle.

'Everywhere you go, nobody wants to let me in.'

When informed of the incident, Sumi Ghosh, who is a regional vice president for Starbucks attempted to phone Kaplan to apaologize.

He sent an email in which he wrote, 'I want to personally apologize to you about what happened.

'It is not consistent with our standards and policies and your experience was clearly not what we would have wanted for you.'
