A Cincinnati man who pleaded guilty in the accidental shooting death of his 11-year-old daughter has been sentenced to six years in prison.

Prosecutors say 34-year-old Deandre Kelley was drunk on January 12 when he fought with his longtime girlfriend and fired two gunshots into the air.

One bullet hit their daughter Shanti Lanza, who had been hiding in an upstairs bedroom.

Kelley pleaded guilty to one count of reckless homicide in an emotional hearing Wednesday in Hamilton County court. In exchange, prosecutors dropped charges of involuntary manslaughter and endangering children, and a weapons count.

Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters argued that Kelley arrived home intoxicated after 2 a.m. and Shanti's mother and his longtime girlfriend, Tina Lanza, forced him out of the house.

Kelley then fired four shots into the air, Deters argued, one of which ended up in a second-story bedroom of the house where Shanti was hiding. The bullet struck her in the chest.

'This is the end of the road for this enabling,' Deters said after an earlier court appearance. 'He needs to be in jail and the rest of them should be looking in the mirror for the reason this little girl is dead.'

Kelley has a lengthy arrest record and has been arrested for drug and alcohol charges.

He also has been charged 3 times in 12 years with domestic violence against Kristina Lanza - with each charge later dropped.

Kelley was convicted in 2003 for assault of two other people,

Kelley's attorney, Hugh McCloskey Jr., says that after talking the case over with the judge, his client realized that a six-year sentence was the best deal he was going to get.

Kelley fired several gunshots with a brown revolver into the air, one of which entered the bedroom window of little Shanti Lanza, killing her.

She died at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Lanza's three siblings were also in the home at the time of the incident along with some friends who were sleeping over.

Antwone Kelley said his brother had left the family's home unaware that his daughter had been shot.

'He might drink a little bit but that was his child, that was his baby. He didn't mean to do this at all. He's more heartbroken than anybody,' he said.

Shanti was found bleeding in her bedroom. She had been hit in the chest. She was the second of Kelley's children to be shot and killed. His son, David Gill, 16, died after a 2012 triple shooting.

Their parents had been together for about 15 years, but had a troubled relationship, family members said. Kelley had been arrested for a domestic disturbance involving Shanti's mother in 2007.

Vince Lanza, Shantiâ€™s uncle, said: 'It was one of those relationships that they can't be together but they can't be without each other.'

Kelley, facing more than 20 years in prison on the original manslaughter charge and other charges, was balking on a plea deal offering a six-year sentence, the minimum possible.

Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier said prosecutors only offered the minimum because Kristina Lanza demanded the most lenient sentence possible for her boyfriend.

During a break for Kelley to consider the offer, family members and friends of Kelley and Lanza argued aggressively with Piepmeier, saying the proposed six-year sentence for killing the girl was too harsh.

One husband and wife were kicked out of court; the wife, who created an uproar in the hall, was arrested.

Tina Lanza was one of several people who physically erupted with emotion and vocal outbursts when Allen read the length of the prison sentence.

She and Danielle Lott, who identified herself as Shanti's aunt, were held in contempt of court after ignoring multiple requests to tone down their behavior, Allen said.

Both women will appear in court on Thursday for a contempt hearing.

'I've handled dozens and dozens of child murders in my career,' prosecutor Piepmeier said.

"This is the first time I've ever had the mother of a murder victim tell me we're treating the person that killed her child too harshly.

'It just makes you scratch your head sometimes, makes you wonder where people are coming from.'
