The family of a British hotelier murdered in St Lucia believes the British government is hampering the investigation in to his death, it has been revealed.

The badly burnt body of 38-year-old Oliver Gobat was found on the idyllic Caribbean island in April. He had been shot twice in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of his Range Rover before the vehicle - with his body inside it - was torched.

Now a private investigation by his family has revealed that there are several 'persons of interest' in Britain who need to be questioned.

However, because of a diplomatic deadlock involving the UK and St Lucia authorities, they have not been quizzed over the death and Britain has yet to send its own police officers to the island.

Mr Gobat’s brother Adam is quoted in The Times as saying: ‘We’re hoping that this new information can persuade the UK government to take action.

‘Inaction is damnable. Inaction is almost tantamount to the government protecting people who may be part of this, or who may have relevant information.’

The Foreign Office is reportedly refusing to accept an invitation from St Lucia authorities for British police to travel to the Commonwealth country to help with the investigation as it wants assurances that the killers will not receive the death penalty.

The Times says foreign office minister Hugo Swire told MPs earlier this week that he would look to find a way of overcoming the diplomatic barriers and that he 'pressed the issue' with the island's high commissioner recently.

Mr Gobat's parents Theo and Helen Gobat have launched a private investigation into the suspected contract killing. 

The couple have put up a £60,000 reward in a last ditch attempt to try and find his killers. 

The manner of Mr Gobat’s death, on a remote track a mile from the upmarket Cap Maison hotel he ran in the north of the island, has led police to believe he was the victim of a contract killing. 

Police sources previously stated Mr Gobat’s death was ‘no ordinary murder’ and it had ‘all the hallmarks of a professional killing’.

Cap Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, was created by the Gobats with their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver.

Guests, who have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa.

Theo Gobat, 75, was born in Chester and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt.

He and another director successfully took over the company's hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison.

His son Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and fitness club in Adelaide, Australia.
