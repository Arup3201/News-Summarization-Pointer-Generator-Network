Legal battle: Nathan Roberts, 30, of Middleton, Greater Manchester, claims that the North West Ambulance Service's policy forced him to resign

A 999 operator with an anxiety disorder is suing his bosses because he was ordered to hot desk.

Nathan Roberts, 30, of Middleton, Greater Manchester, claims that the North West Ambulance Service's policy forced him to resign.

The father-of-two - who said he would suffer panic attacks after finding colleagues in his preferred seat - has seen his case thrown out by London judges, but could now take it to Europe.

He had asked bosses for a desk close to a window and near the back wall of the busy office in Belle Vue, to prevent his disorder flaring up.

Ambulance chiefs put a ‘reserved’ sign on Mr Roberts's preferred seat - but they said overlapping shifts made it impractical to guarantee he could always sit in the same place.

Mr Roberts quit and sued the NWAS, alleging constructive dismissal and a breach of the Disability Discrimination Act. His case was  rejected by a tribunal and an appeal tribunal before going before London’s Appeal Court - where it has now also been dismissed.

But Mr Roberts said he had not yet given up on his four-year battle and was considering taking his case to the European Court of Human Rights.

He added: ‘It’s the end of the road domestically and the only alternative is Europe. It’s something I’m considering and I will speak to my solicitors about it.

‘I don’t think the Disability 
Discrimination Act, and its replacement the Equality Act, provide enough
 protection for people with mental health disabilities.

‘I don’t think people with mental health disabilities are treated the same as those with physical disabilities, and that’s the point I would make to the European court.’

Mr Roberts started working for NWAS in 2008, handling incoming 999 and non-emergency calls.

He said that his panic attacks could be triggered by a number of things, including the amount of people in the vicinity.

He resigned on New Year’s Eve in 2009 when, following the introduction of hot-desking, he arrived for work to find his seat taken for a third time.

Lord Justice Moore-Bick, sitting in the Appeal Court, said his supervisors had agreed to place a reserved sign on his chosen seat to ensure it was available for him when he started his shift.

But he added that, in the high-tempo working environment, it was not always possible for his seat to be available if he arrived for work early.

The court heard there were isolated incidents when colleagues would be at his desk. But Lord Justice Moore-Bick said NWAS had done its best to ensure that Mr Roberts had a desk of his own.

MailOnline also covered his case in February 2012, reporting that a win for Mr Roberts could see him receive a pay-out of up to £500,000 - paid for by the taxpayer.
