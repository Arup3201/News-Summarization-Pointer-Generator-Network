Claims: Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has been arrested by U.S. intelligence services, according to unconfirmed reports

Roman Abramovich's agent today denied reports the Russian billionaire had been arrested by U.S. intelligence services.

Speculation was rife online this afternoon that the Chelsea football club owner, 46, had been detained by the FBI in New York.

The claims were initially made by a Russian news website before being circulated on Twitter.

But Mr Abramovich's Moscow-based agent 
John Mann said the report was 'not true'.

'He is in the U.S., but he has not been arrested or detained,' he said.

The FBI has also issued a denial.

'We didn't arrest him. It's just not true,' a spokeswoman said in response to an unsourced report by Russia's RBK financial news portal.

Mr Abramovich has reportedly docked 
his $1.5billion (£1bn) yacht Eclipse, the world's biggest, in New York because his partner 
Dasha Zhukova is due to give birth to his seventh child.

Evraz shares, which have fallen 45pc 
over the past year, slid 5 oer cent at one stage in early afternoon trading 
before clawing back lost ground after the rumour was denied.

Abramovich, 46, is a major 
shareholder in London-listed steel firm Evraz, whose shares fell by more
than 6 per cent before recovering to trade 3.4 per cent down on the day after the denials were issued.

The
London-based tycoon, reputed to have close ties to the Kremlin, was 
brought in late last year to strike a peace deal between the feuding 
shareholders in Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel and palladium
miner.

With an estimated fortune of $14.6billion, he is currently the 5th richest person in Russia and the 50th in the world, according to the 2012 Forbes list.

Born into poverty in Saratov, Russia, Mr Abramovich was orphaned at the age of two and raised by his uncle in Ukhta.

Mr Abramovich's agent John Mann issued several denials on his Twitter account this afternoon

As a student in Moscow, he set up a 
small firm making plastic toys which made him enough money to start an 
oil business in the Omsk region.

He quickly made a name for himself and joined the board on oil giant Sibneft before taking sole charge.

He oversaw a merger which created the
fourth-biggest oil company in the world before it was sold to the 
state-run gas company, Gazprom.

In
1999, Mr Abramovich was elected to the lower house of the Russian 
parliament representing Chukotka and was re-elected for a second term in 2005.

He bought Chelsea in 2003 after stepping in to save the club from administration.

The
team has enjoyed considerable success since, winning six domestic cups,
three Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League.

But it is estimated that Mr Abramovich has invested some $1billion in the process.

Legal fight: Last year, Mr Abramovich won a multi-billion-pound High Court battle with fellow oligarch Boris Berezovsky (pictured), who was found dead at his Ascot home on Saturday

Along the way, he has also built a reputation as a ruthless hirer and firer, with several managers coming and going during his tenure.

The latest, Roberto Di Matteo, was sacked just months after winning the Champions league and FA Cup.

Last
year, Mr Abramovich won a multi-billion-pound High Court battle with 
fellow oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who was found dead at his Ascot home on Saturday.

Berezovsky,
66, once worth £2billion, had alleged that Mr Abramovich 
blackmailed and intimidated him into selling cheaply his share in a 
Russian oil company, but the High Court rejected his £3.2billion damages
claim.

Berezovsky's death 
is still 'unexplained' according to police after his body was discovered
by a bodyguard on the bathroom floor of his mansion in Ascot, 
Berkshire, on Saturday.

The 46-year-old has been married and divorced twice, to Olga Yurevna Lysova and Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina (pictured)

He apparently left no note and sceptical friends are convinced he was murdered because 'suicide was not in his DNA'.

Mr Abramovich already has two sons and three daughters with his ex-wife Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina and one with Dasha.

The oligarch, who has been married and divorced twice, met Dasha, the daughter of Russian oligarch Alexander Zhukova at a New Year's Eve party hosted by her father in 2006.

But apparently romance did not blossom between the two until he had split from second wife Irina after 16 years of marriage.

Their divorce ended in a record settlement rumoured to be £1.5billion made by Abramovich to the mother of his five children.
