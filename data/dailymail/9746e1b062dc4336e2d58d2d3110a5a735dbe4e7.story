Chilling surveillance footage captures the moment an army veteran ambushes an Oklahoma office worker holding him hostage at gunpoint as he goes on a search for more hostages in an Oklahoma office building earlier this month.

Joe Steadman was walking back from his lunch break in Norman, Oklahoma shortly before 12.30pm when an armed Devin Rogers, 29, wearing a backpack and combat boots, grabbed him in a parking lot and shoved a gun to his neck, KOTV reports. 

'I asked him, ‘Do you want money? What are your demands?’ and all he said was ‘more people’ in just the evilest, creepiest voice you can imagine,' Steadman told KOTV.

Footage: Recently released surveillance footage shows army veteran, Devin Rogers, 29, (above) as he takes an officer worker hostage at gunpoint while he searches for more hostages in an Oklahoma office building

  

In the video, Rogers is seen marching Steadman toward the three-story Nextep office building. Police say that Rogers forced Steadman to open the door to the building using his Key Card access.

Once inside, Steadman told the secretary, seen in the surveillance video sitting behind a desk in the office's lobby, that he was a hostage and told her to call the police, according to New York Daily News. 

'I said, ‘I have a young family, please don't kill me,’ and he said, ‘If I wanted you dead, you’d already be dead,' Steadman told KOTV about the Nov. 10 afternoon. 

The video ends with Rogers forcing Steadman onto the elevator and the two end up on the building's second floor where Steadman works, according toThe Oklahoman. 

Steadman recalled to the Oklahoman that Rogers kept saying that he needed 'more people' but with it being close to the lunch hour, the office building was nearly empty.

On the second floor, Rogers saw three people in the Farzaneh law firm office through a locked, glass door including Jennifer McMinn-Shokat and Daymon Capers,  News 9 reports.

Forced: Rogers forced Joe Steadman to use his company key card to gain access to the building and marched him, at gunpoint, past a secretary's desk in the lobby of the office building in Norman, Oklahoma

Elevator: The surveillance footage ends with Rogers forcing Steadman on an elevator, the two reportedly end up on the second floor fo the three-story building and Rogers finds more hostages

Steadman told News 9 that Rogers tried unsuccessfully to shatter the glass door with his gun, and then opened fire on the door as the workers inside scattered.

Rogers had to use both of his hands to shoot the gun and this gave Steadman the opportunity to run the 20 feet to his office, call the police, and hide  until SWAT teams showed up and reunited him with his family.

CBS news reports that Rogers was in communication with SWAT teams during the standoff and around 1.16pm, a large number of people were evacuated from the building. No one was injured.

Steadman described the incident as the 'scariest moment of my life,' however, a woman held hostage by Rogers on the second floor, told the Oklahoman that Rogers was 'very nice.' 

'When he first came in there, I was pretty hysterical,' McMinn-shokat said. 'He actually calmed me down and assured me, ‘I’m not going to hurt you.’

McMinn-Shokat said that after the reassurances she began to calm down and 'went into survival mode.' 

Extremely Courteous: Hostage Jennifer McMinn-Shokat (above) described Rogers as 'extremely courteous' and said she never thought to run or hide from the 6 foot 4 gunman

Facebook: In the Facebook post above, posted just one day after the incident, McMinn-Shokat said Rogers was 'a great gunman as far as gunmen go'

She said she never thought to run or hide from the 6 foot 4 gunman, and thought it best to engage the army veteran in conversation as other terrified workers hid in adjacent offices. 

During their conversation, Rogers reportedly revealed to McMinn-Shokat that he is a California native and had fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. He told her that he was struggling to find work and hadn't been able to get anything better than a minimum wage job. 

'He just said he wanted to go to jail,' McMinn-shokat said. 'He felt that he had no more value in society and that he just wanted to go to jail and be in solitary confinement for the rest of his life.'

The Daily News reports that Rogers let McMinn-Shokat go free around 4.30pm and surrendered peacefully to authorities, ending the more than four-hour ordeal. 

McMinn-Shokat described her captor as a gentleman, saying he was 'extremely courteous.' 

In a Facebook post by the paralegal, she wrote that Rogers was a 'great gunman as far as gunmen go.' And continued saying  he 'was not so much a bad guy as a broken one.' 

McMinn-Shokat told the Daily News that she forgives her 'broken' captor. 

Rogers is being held at Cleveland County Jail on multiple felony charges including, kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon, illegally discharging a weapon, and possessing a weapon while committing a felony.
