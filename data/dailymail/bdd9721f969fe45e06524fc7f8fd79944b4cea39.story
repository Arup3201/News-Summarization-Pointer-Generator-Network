England began this summer wanting pace, bounce and carry in their Test pitches but have instead been confronted with surfaces more akin to Colombo and Kolkata than Lord’s, Headingley and Trent Bridge.

The result on Wednesday was that India felt very much at home on the first day of a pivotal series for Alastair Cook.

Certainly there was no home advantage in Nottingham for England on a low, slow batting paradise of a pitch that was prepared more to ensure that the first Investec Test will last into the weekend rather than produce compelling cricket.

Duncan Fletcher never gives much away but the India coach would have been inwardly grinning like a Cheshire cat behind his inscrutable façade at the warm hospitality offered to his side here by his old employers at the ECB.

Australians did not stop whingeing last year at pitches they considered were made for Graeme Swann but clearly groundsmen are either unwilling or unable to provide the sort of life that would have offered hope to England here.

Murali Vijay averages 18 outside of India but here he was able to record his first Test century away from his home country even though England did pretty much all they could to keep their opponents within reach.

Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have fabulous records at Trent Bridge but with the ball refusing to swing other than for an all too brief spell of reverse after lunch this was every bit as tough for them as Sri Lanka’s famous victory in Leeds.

England, to be fair, had a pretty good day but still ended it with India on 259 for four and if this is the way it will be for a five-Test series that will be crammed into just 42 days then there will be some exhausted bowlers by the end of it.

That is if any bowlers are still standing by then. The first casualty of a punishing itinerary came on the very first day when Ben Stokes, returning to the England side, appeared to suffer a side injury pushing himself through the dirt.

Stokes will not be the last if the Test venues continue to put the bottom line before the need to produce more of an even contest between bat and ball, let alone the wishes of a national side who ultimately pay domestic cricket’s bills.

New drainage systems and the heavy roller are being blamed for lifeless English pitches but far more pertinent is the ECB’s prohibitive bidding system for Tests that sees counties paying huge fees to stage matches. Tests have to last five days for any county to make a profit from big matches.

Broad was seen in animated conversation with Trent Bridge groundsman Steve Birks on Tuesday, apparently questioning the look of the pitch, and his worst fears were realised by this lifeless, soul-destroying 22 yards of turf.

There must be some guilt at Trent Bridge because Birks took the almost unprecedented step of admitting he had got things wrong in his preparation.

‘We wanted to produce a pitch with pace, bounce and carry but unfortunately it hasn’t happened,’ said Birks on day one. ‘There’s quite a lot of moisture underneath but it’s a hard surface on top which is why it’s lacking pace.

‘Our only instruction is to produce a good cricket wicket and, with hindsight, we may have left a bit more grass on it but this is the first day of a five-day Test and we hope it might quicken up a bit.’

England, not to mention spectators seeking value for money, will hope he is right. ‘We are amazing hosts,’ said Anderson wryly. ‘And we are as frustrated as everyone watching. As bowlers we want our nicks to carry and for there to be a more even contest between bat and ball but I thought our attitude was fantastic. We could have moaned and groaned but we just got on with it. The pitch is what it is and we can’t do anything about it.’

At lunch, after India had moved serenely to 106 for one, England already seemed to be staring down the barrel but they pulled things back after the interval in an hour where India scored just 18 runs and lost two wickets.

Anderson, who had taken his 50th Test wicket at Trent Bridge when Shikhar Dhawan fell to a brilliant Matt Prior catch, suddenly got the ball to reverse and Cook backed him up with imaginative field placings.

Cheteshwar Pujara was equally well caught by Ian Bell after Cook had placed him at silly mid on while Bell’s safe hands were equally to the fore when Virat Kohli played at a Broad delivery he could have left alone and edged to slip.

After that normal service was pretty much resumed with England’s only other success coming when Ajinkya Rahane toe-ended an attempted pull off Liam Plunkett to Cook at silly point before India’s captain MS Dhoni joined Vijay in an unbroken partnership of 81 that saw India on top at the close.

Vijay became watchful, notably while spending 48 balls in the 90s, while Dhoni was much more forthright, his strong wrists to the fore in his punchy strokes with minimal backlift. England need to separate the pair quickly on Thursday.

No real criticism could be aimed at the bowlers who, on the whole, let Cook down at Headingley, with Broad in particular looking much more like his old self while conceding only 26 runs from his 19 overs.

Cook is under considerable scrutiny so it should be said that tactically he was bright and imaginative, with his only flaw being his reluctance to plug the third man gap where more than 30 per cent of India’s runs were scored.

He can only hope that an expected change in the weather on day two might alter conditions for the bowlers. Otherwise England could be in trouble.
