Queen of thieves: Margaret Johnson has been banned from Birmingham city centre for five years

A thief dubbed the 'Queen of pickpockets', who has 77 previous convictions, has been banned from entering her local city centre for five years.

Margaret Johnson, 38, targeted four shoppers - including a 90-year-old pensioner - in a matter of minutes in January this year. She was then jailed for 43 weeks. 

But the 'professional' pickpocket has now also been given a criminal behaviour order, which prevents her from entering Birmingham city centre - or she risks going back to prison.

The 90-year-old woman had been using a walking frame while browsing shops in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. 

Johnson, of no fixed address, then snatched her handbag and purse, stealing her pension and personal belongings.

Other victims included a new mother whose handbag was lifted from her toddler's pushchair and a customer at Clarks who suddenly realised her bag was stolen while she tried on shoes. 

Johnson has made a living out of sneakily stealing bags and purses from distracted parents, the elderly and foreign students around the city. 

Sergeant Ifty Ahmed, from Birmingham West and Central offender management team, said: 'CCTV linked Johnson to the offences and she was jailed for a total of 43 weeks earlier this year.

'The CBO granted on Monday gives us a huge degree of control over her behaviour and will prevent Johnson from visiting her usual haunts to commit crime.'

Exclusion zone: Johnson's ban, which includes the busy Bullring shopping centre, comes after a 43-week jail sentence after she targeted four shoppers in a matter of minutes in January this year

He added: 'This professional pickpocket had no regard for the victims she targeted or the trauma she caused them by stealing their personal possessions.

'Her movements were calculated and her actions deliberate. If she is caught in the city centre over the next five years she will be brought before the courts and could be jailed.

'Pickpockets love to work in crowded spaces and prey on innocent shoppers so although this is a great result I would urge anyone to remain alert when out in busy places.'

In addition to the ban from Birmingam city centre, Johnson is prohibited from entering Poundland, Clarks Shoes, Iceland, ASDA, Deichman shoes UK, McDonald's, Farmfoods, Oasis, Next and Mothercare in the West Midlands area.
