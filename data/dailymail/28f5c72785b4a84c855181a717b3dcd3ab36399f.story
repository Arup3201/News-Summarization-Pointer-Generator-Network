Supermodel Gigi Hadid has shared a unique glimpse into the rigorous workout routine that enables her to maintain such a trim and toned physique. 

The 19-year-old, who recently posed topless in a stunning campaign for Guess, invited the Vogue.com cameras to join her at the Gotham Gym in New York, where she takes part in regular one-on-one boxing training. 

And after going through some intensive warm-up exercises, which include skipping and ladder training, the Victoria's Secret model steps into the ring to go up against her burly-looking fitness instructor Rob Piela, all the while offering a series of tips and tricks to the camera as she throws a few well-aimed punches.

Fitness fanatic: The Guess model is renowned for her love of working out

'Boxing has been great for me, because it's like my new sport, so it's something that I can get better at,' Gigi explains. 

As she starts bouncing around the ring, the budding boxer adds: 'So you want to keep your hands up by your face, obviously, to protect the gold. 

'And then you're going to put your left hand at [your opponent], it's called a jab and it's usually to keep the distance from you.'

Gigi, who is dating Austalian popstar Cody Simpson, continues by demonstrating her ferocious jab technique, aiming her fist directly at the camera while remaining on the balls of her feet. 

'And then you're going to go to your right hand for power,' she continues. 'And then you're going to turn and uppercut, that's usually when they get too close to you.'

It's all over! The model was clearly thrilled to be done with her ferocious fitness session

Gigi is renowned for being something of a fitness fan and regularly posts videos and images of herself working out on her Instagram account. 

It's been a busy few weeks for the former Sports Illustrated model, who is reported to have spent Christmas in Los Angeles, before jetting off for a New Year's getaway in Abu Dhabi with her boyfriend, as well as close friends Selena Gomez and Kendall Jenner. 

Earlier this week, Gigi and Cody were off again, this time to Shanghai, China, where Cody was presented with the International Male Artist award at the Huading Award Global Music Satisfaction Survey ceremony.

On Sunday, the rising fashion star paid tribute to her on-again-off-again boyfriend in celebration of his 18th birthday.

Alongside a picture of the couple enjoying a romantic sunset stroll on the beach, the model wrote: 'Happy birthday to you my bub ♡ you are an unmatched soul in this world and love in my heart x'

The young couple's relationship appears to be stronger than ever, despite being plagued in the past by constant split rumors. 

Gigi and Cody were first rumored to have ended their year-long relationship in May 2014, before reuniting in June, only to split again just two months later. 

But since November last year, the duo appear to have reunited once and for all - and having been enjoying spending as much time together as possible in recent months.
