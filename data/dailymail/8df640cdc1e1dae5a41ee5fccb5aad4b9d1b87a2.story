For many Britons, escaping the trials and tribulations of a hectic family/work lifestyle is a perfect excuse to book a sunshine getaway abroad.

But there are some things that they can't go without - and shockingly fast food is one of those. 

It seems half of British holidaymakers leave their hunger for adventure at the door when it comes to dining abroad. 

Brits go for fast food on foreign holidays as it is cheaper and they have fears over how clean restaurants are

A survey of 2,000 people by Hotels.com has revealed that 50 per cent of Brits admit to choosing well-known fast food restaurants over local eateries when on holiday.

Lizann Peppard of the Hotels.com brand said: 'It's a shame to think that thousands of Brits travelling across the world will be choosing standardised fast food instead of indulging in international delicacies such as Italian osso buco or Singaporean chilli crab. 

'Cuisine is a major part of all cultures and enjoying local food is a wonderful way to make the most of a trip away from home.' 

While almost a third (30 per cent) of Brits choose fast food on holiday because it's the most cost effective option, one in ten (10 per cent) admit they believe that fast food is tastier than foreign fare. 

A fifth of people surveyed admitted to going for fast food as they don't understand other menus

A fifth (20 per cent) of Brits say they actually choose fast food because they don't understand menus in local establishments, showing that alongside cuisine, language is not really a high priority for many Britons travelling overseas. 

Furthermore, nine per cent of British travellers confess to being delicate diners, as they simply don't trust local eateries to be clean enough.

Even in familiar restaurants abroad tourists admit to being picky with a staggering 85 per cent revealing they don't even like trying unfamiliar international additions to chain-restaurant menus, completely ruling out the chance for any foreign foodie forays.
