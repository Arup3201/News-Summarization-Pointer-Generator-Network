Most people preparing to walk down the aisle have to tighten their belts and save up in preparation for the big day.

But Sainbury's workers' Maggie, 60, and Mike Davies, 63, created a wedding fund with a twist when they spent 18 months collecting 40,000 loyalty points which paid for all the food when they tied the knot.

The maximum they would have had to spend to get the points is £20,000 - but the couple guess they only spent £5,000

Using their Nectar points they managed to put together a sumptuous buffet to feed all 140 of their guests.

The Davies, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, spent the £200 worth of points on a feast of sandwiches, quiches, sausage rolls and desserts.

Mr Davies said: 'The food went down very well. The points paid for everything food wise, the only extra thing we had to get was the gateau which Sainsbury's didn't do.'

They met working at the supermarket and a choir of  their colleagues sang at the ceremony.

The pair, who both still work at the shop, mainly collected in-store but also  by paying their British Gas bill online. Normally two Nectar points are awarded 
per £1 spent.

They
believe they spent roughly £200 a month on food shopping and bought 
'everything', including Mrs Davies honeymoon wardrobe, in the shop.

Mr
Davies said: 'We definitely didn't spend £20,000 getting the points - 
we work at Sainsbury's and don't spend that much in a year. It would be 
less than half, probably a quarter, of that.'

Mrs Davies added: 'If we went through the tills and were given a voucher that says you get a thousand points to buy this product then we would actually go out of our way to get that product.'

Deli worker Mrs Davies, nee Alderman, added: 'It would have been really tight without the points.

'Our big day could not have been more perfect - it was more than I could ever have imagined.'

Her colleagues on the counters made the food and her boss even made their wedding cake as a gift.

One
of the customers got Mrs Davies to the registry office on time after 
volunteering to be chauffeur when she heard they were having problems 
getting a driver.

Mrs Davies said: 'She is one of Sainsbury's valued customers and we do like to get personal.'

The faithful workers even matched the flowers, buttonhole and Mr Davies' tie to the colour of the Nectar card

The pair married in a registry office, but took a quick detour to the store where they work for some quirky wedding pictures

The blushing bride raised a toast to the Nectar cards after their loyalty points, collected over a year and a half, paid to feed their 140 guests

The couple, who have both been married before and have 10 grandchildren between them, exchanged their vows at Kidderminster registry office.

The reception was held at Kidderminster Harriers football stadium.

Mr Davies, who works in the fresh food department, said: 'We decided to pool all our Nectar points and use them for the wedding.

'In 18 months we didn’t spend a single Nectar point and always bought products which could earn you extra points because of an offer. We couldn’t have done it without them.'

After their eyes met over the aisles the Davies got together in 2010 and Mr Davies proposed on Valentine’s Day last year.

He said: 'I was Maggie's immediate supervisor, that is were we first met.'

Mrs Davies said: 'He used to be my boss'.

But her new husband quipped: 'Now it is the other way around.'
