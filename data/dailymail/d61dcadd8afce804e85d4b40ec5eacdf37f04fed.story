Alex Salmond, the Scottish Nationalist Party leader, has launched a bitter attack on the Australian prime minister after he warned against Scottish independence, branding his comments 'bewildering, hypocritical and foolish'.

Mr Salmond spoke out after Tony Abbott weighed into the debate. Mr Abbott said separatists who back the 'break-up' of the UK 'are not the friends of justice or freedom'.

Mr Abbott, who leads the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, said it was 'hard to see' how independence would benefit the rest of the world.

He added that those who 'cheer' at the prospect of independence 'are not the countries whose company one would like to keep'.

But Mr Salmond reacted angrily, saying Mr Abbott's comments had 'all the hallmarks of one of the Westminster's international briefings against Scotland'.

He added that the comments were 'hypocritical' because independence 'does not seem to have done Australia any harm'.

The Yes Scotland campaign, spearheaded by
 Mr Salmond, and the Better Together campaign, launched by Alistair 
Darling, will go head-to-head at the polls on September 18.

Mr Salmond said: 'Tony Abbott has a reputation for 
gaffes, but his bewildering comments have all the hallmarks of one of 
the Westminster Government's international briefings against Scotland.

'Many
 Australians, including the great number with close Scottish 
connections, will look on in bafflement at these remarks - Australia is a
 country that has gained its independence from Westminster and has never
 looked back.

'An
 independent Scotland will be a beacon for fairness, justice and 
cooperation in the international community - and a great friend of 
Australia.'

He later told the BBC: 'Mr Abbott's comments are hypocritical because independence does not seem to have done Australia any harm.'

Mr Abbott, a staunch monarchist with an English father, told the Times:
 'What the Scots do is a matter for the Scots and not for a moment do I 
presume to tell Scottish voters which way they should vote.

'But
 as a friend of Britain, as an observer from afar, it's hard to see how 
the world would be helped by an independent Scotland.

'I
 think that the people who would like to see the break-up of the United 
Kingdom are not the friends of justice, not the friends of freedom, and 
that the countries that would cheer at the prospect of the break-up with
 the United Kingdom are not the countries whose company one would like 
to keep.'

His comments came after US president Barack Obama 
said in June this year that his administration had a 'deep interest' in ensuring the United 
Kingdom remained united.

Pope Francis, Hillary Clinton, Chinese premier Li Keqiang and more than 200 public figures from the arts and media, including Mick Jagger and Eddie Izzard, have also previously made comments widely seen in support of the Better Together campaign.

Earlier this year, Barack Obama also made comments about the independence debate, saying the UK should remain 'strong, robust and united'

During the interview, the leader - who was
 born in England and studied for two years at the University of Oxford -
 admitted he was 'an incorrigible anglophile' and said he 'loves 
England'. 

He also praised Scotland, 
describing the Scottish enlightenment as the 'intellectual foundation 
for so much of what's best in the modern world'. 

But the leader told the paper that the 
UK, Australia and other English-speaking countries need to 
stay strong at a time when he says there is a great threat to freedom.

Despite that, he would not be drawn on Britain's relationship with Europe, saying membership to the European Union would be 'left to others to judge'.

Earlier this year, Mr Obama said he wanted to see the UK remain 'strong, robust and 
united' during a joint news conference with Mr Cameron at the G7 in 
Brussels.

Yes campaigners claimed Mr Cameron was 
involved and said it showed the 'growing desperation' of the pro-Union campaign.

That same month, Pope Francis made comments which were widely seen as endorsing the no campaign.

He said the break-up of countries such as the former Yugoslavia was justified because its people were so diverse.

Alex Salmond is leading the Yes campaign, which per-referendum polling shows has backing from around 38 per cent of would-be voters

But when asked about breakaway regions such as Scotland and Catalonia in states where people had long been united, he said the case for independence was ‘not so clear’.

He said: ‘All division worries me. There will be cases that are just, but the secession of a nation without a history of enforced unity must be taken very carefully and analysed case by case.’

Hillary Clinton, who is tipped to replace Mr Obama as US president in 2016, also previously told BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I would hate to have you lose Scotland.’

Harry Potter author JK Rowling also donated £1million to the Better Together campaign against independence.

And earlier this month, more than 200 public figures from sport, cinema, television and 
literature wrote an open letter to the people of Scotland in 
advance of next month’s referendum which says: 'Let’s stay together'.

The letter was signed by the likes of Sir Mick Jagger, Dame Judi Dench and Stephen Hawking.

Helena Bonham Carter, the actress, Tom Daley, the Olympian, and rower Sir Steve Redgrave also gave their names to the plea.

After a long-running referendum campaign, Scots
 will finally go to the polls on September 18 to answer the question, 'Should Scotland be an 
independent country?'

The Yes campaign, led primarily by the Scottish National Party, believes the nation would be strengthened by independence but the UK government is opposed to the breakaway.

Turnout in the historic ballot is widely expected to be high - it has been suggested as many of 80 per cent of those registered to vote will choose to do so.

Latest opinion polls by TNS show the 'no' vote's lead has reached a record low, but is still ahead with around 46 per cent.

Those who are intending to vote 'yes' is at around 38 per cent, while those who are undecided is at 16 per cent.

After his comments were published, a Yes Scotland spokesman said: 'Independence seems to be working well for Australia.

'These
 comments have echoes of Lord George Robertson's "forces of darkness" 
speech in April which was widely ridiculed, even by No supporters, as 
one of the anti-independence campaign's most outlandish scare stories.

'The
 decision about Scotland's future is one for the people of Scotland to 
make - a point that even David Cameron asserts.

'After a Yes vote, 
Scotland will take her place as a normal and valued member of the 
international community - just as Australia did when she gained 
independence at the turn of the century.'

During Mr Abbott's 24-hour trip to London, the
 Australian leader also met foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and his 
predecessor, William Hague. He also had a meeting with Tony Blair.

His
 visit to London came after a visit 
to the Netherlands, in the wake of the Flight MH17 disaster.

The Australians 
lost more people on that than any other nation, after Malaysia and Holland.
