A Ferrari-driving bully who plundered his wealthy lover’s estate after she disappeared has been found guilty of her murder.

Donald Graham killed heiress and property developer Janet Brown, 45, so he could fund his lavish taste in supercars and buy his second mistress a home. Miss Brown vanished in 2005 and her body has never been found.

He stole £300,000 of her savings, sold her Land Rover and Porsche with a personalised number plate, took her horses and tried to siphon off thousands of pounds from her estate and that of her family.

Donald Graham, 59, has been found guilty of killing his lover Janet Brown, 45, and hiding her body before trying to strip her and her elderly parents of all their assets

Ms Brown (left), a wealthy heiress, went missing before she was due to go on holiday in 2005. Graham (right) killed her, hid her body, then sent fake postcards from France pretending to be her and saying she had a job

He also spun a cruel web of lies that left Miss Brown’s parents believing she was still alive.

After
 a seven-week trial at  Newcastle Crown Court, Graham was found guilty 
of her murder and perverting the course of  justice yesterday.

After the verdict, police called on Graham, nicknamed ‘Dodgy Don’, to tell Miss Brown’s family what he had done with her body.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Nicola Musgrove, of Northumbria Police, said: ‘Graham 
is a controlling and manipulative man, particularly towards women; a 
bully who deliberately instils fear into people and uses intimidating 
behaviour to get his own way.

‘He is a callous man who made it look like Janet was alive when in fact he had, motivated by financial greed, murdered her.’

Graham, 60, described as ‘flash’ and always ‘dripping in gold’, had lived with his wife Denise, 66, but had two mistresses.

Donald gained the trust of Ms Brown's elderly and ill parents, stole their bank details, and after their deaths he plundered their estate using it to pay for fast cars (pictured, Graham's Ferrari)

Graham was on trial with another lover, Elizabeth Todd (right), accused of making a fake will signing Ms Brown's family farm over to him. The jury were unable to reach a verdict on Todd, 51 (right)

Last night an acquantaince of Graham, Elliot Stuart, 68, said: ‘People were frightened of him just because of his reputation.

‘When
 we would go out he would park his car on double  yellow lines outside 
restaurants, like he was in the gangster  movies. Nobody would ever stop
 him or ask him to move.

‘His stepson told me he is a nasty man and made his life and his mother’s life a misery.’

Another
 friend, and former partner of Miss Brown, known as Mick, said: ‘Janet 
met Don through me. I serviced his cars, he had a Ferrari, a Porsche, 
four-wheel drives, a Subaru Impreza.

‘He was polite, plausible, 
well-educated but if he came and asked you for money you would give it 
to him because he looked like he would pull your head off.’

Prosecutor Robert Smith, QC, told jurors that Graham’s lifestyle ‘didn’t match his income and his assets’.

Graham 
 and Miss Brown, from Hexham, Northumberland, who had saved ‘substantial
 assets’ of over £400,000, had been together for eight years. He told 
her that his wife had cancer and when she died they would marry.

The 
pair arranged to go on holiday to France in 2005 but at the last minute 
he pulled out, claiming his wife was unwell, so Miss Brown decided to go
 alone.

Despite repeated searches by police (pictured) Ms Brown's body has never been found. The court heard that Graham was her lover for eight years despite already being married

Nicola Musgrove, from Northumbria Police, said Graham should now admit what he has done with Ms Brown's body so that her family can be allowed to grieve

It was around the day of her intended departure on June 17 that 
she was murdered.

Her parents Olive and Eric Brown, a former accountant 
who had ‘substantial’ savings, were led to believe she was living in 
Europe after Graham sent a series of fake postcards and letters.

They 
died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was 
working in a bank in Switzerland.

The court heard that after booking 
the holiday, Graham had found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, 51, with
 whom he had become infatuated.

Jurors were told that Graham wanted 
Miss Brown’s money so he could ‘live a lifestyle that involved owning 
and driving powerful motor cars’ and buy a property for Todd to live in.

His
 downfall came in 2009 when one of the banks Eric Brown had an account 
with suspected fraudulent activity and called in the police.

Mr 
Justice Openshaw said he would pass sentence today on Graham, who was 
also convicted of perverting the course of justice and had admitted a 
number of fraud charges. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on Todd 
who was accused of fraud, forgery and jointly accused of perverting the 
course of justice.
