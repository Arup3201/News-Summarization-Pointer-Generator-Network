Recharging your batteries while shopping or sightseeing will soon involve more than just getting a latte, and a comfortable seat.

Starbucks has announced it will be offering wireless mats for customers to power their mobile phones while they sip on their mocha.

The global coffee chain has teamed up with Duracell Powermat to begin the U.S. rollout across 7,500 Starbucks and Teavana shops.

Starbucks has announced it will be offering wireless mats (pictured) for customers to power their mobile phones while they sip on their mocha. The global coffee chain has teamed up with Duracell Powermat to begin a U.S. rollout of wireless phone chargers in Starbucks and Teavana shops

The 
technology is described as ‘inductive charging’ because it uses magnetic
 induction.

The current coming from the power outlet moves through the 
wire in the charger, creating a magnetic field.

The
 magnetic field then generates a current in the coil inside the device, 
which is connected to the battery to charge a mobile phone. 

To use the 
system, customers must have a mobile with built-in wireless charging, or
 a phone accessory that provides the same capabilities.

These can be brought for around £15 in the UK and $25 in the U.S.

Chains in the San Francisco Bay Area will be the first to get the technology, which allows customers to charge their mobiles on designated table areas.

According to Starbucks, over the next three years, more than 100,000 table chargers will be installed in Starbucks' 7,500 company-owned stores in the U.S.

The group has yet to reveal plans about a global rollout, or whether the technology will also be brought to the UK.

‘Powermat Spots in Starbucks are the result of almost a decade of scientific research spanning material sciences, magnetic induction and mesh networking,’ said Ran Poliakine, chief executive of Powermat Technologies.

‘The two-pronged power-plug dates back to the era of the horse drawn carriage, so that today’s announcement marks the first meaningful upgrade to the way we access power in well over a century.’

The typical customer will probably use the wireless re-charger for about 15 minutes, Starbucks predicts.

The group is also planning to pilot a programme later this year that will let customers order ahead via mobile apps.

It could mean the end of the daily hunt for power cables.

Korean researchers have unveiled an experimental wireless recharging system that could top up the mobile of everyone in the office wirelessly.

The system can transmit power up to 16 ft (five metres), and charge up to 40 phones at a time. It is even powerful enough to power a TV.

Called the 'Dipole Coil Resonant System', it is believed to be the longest range wireless power system developed so far.

'The way electronic devices receive their power has changed tremendously over the past few decades, from wired to non-wired,' the researchers say.

'Users today enjoy all kinds of wireless electronic gadgets including cell phones, mobile displays, tablet PCs, and even batteries.

Chun T. Rim, a professor of Nuclear & Quantum Engineering at KAIST in Korea, said the system could also power larger items.

'With DCRS a large LED TV as well as three 40 W-fans can be powered from a 5-meter distance.'

The distance is a record for wireless technology.

Current phone systems, for example, require the user to place their phone on a charging 'pad - such as the one being introduced to Starbuck stores.

With the new system, they would never need to remove it from their bag or pocket.
