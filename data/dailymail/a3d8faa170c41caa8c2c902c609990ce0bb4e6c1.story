One of the most fascinating aspects of Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography for the public must be the revealing of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room.

It’s certainly not as harmonious or lovey-dovey as people might presume. Players are always getting on each other’s nerves or having issues to resolve.

You hear professional footballers whingeing if they are away for longer than a couple of weeks at a World Cup but international cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team-mates than their families.

Kevin Pietersen has lifted the lid on all the frailties and insecurities in the dressing room

There will always be tensions, particularly when you consider the highly-pressurised environment they work in and that every move they make is scrutinised and analysed.

The Manchester United footballers Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn’t get on and in my England team Darren Gough and Andy Caddick had their moments, but that doesn’t really matter. As I said in these pages the other day, Michael Holding will tell you that some members of the great West Indies side didn’t get on. Shane Warne will say the same about his Australian team.

But once they stepped on that field they respected each other and did everything in their power to win the game for their team.

I liken it to sitting an examination every day of the week, and we all know how nervous and tetchy our kids can be the day before an exam. It is why there will always be niggles between team-mates and why they won’t always get on.

I’ve heard about the accusation of cliques in the England dressing room but that has always been the case and always will be.

There will always be groups of three or four players who prefer to spend time with each other. When you are away for three months, you can’t expect everyone to go out together every night. You have to treat players like adults and in return they must have respect for one another even if they are not mates.

There was plenty of banter and mickey-taking in the England dressing room when I played but someone like Marcus Trescothick, perhaps because he was teased about his weight when he was young, was always good at reminding anyone to be careful about not crossing the line.

Rarely would we have a go at each other about cricketing mistakes because it was all so important but Mike Atherton, for one, would always remind me if I got out to a bad shot. It was just that he would wait a few days before doing so.

That is not bullying to me and I can honestly say I have never considered any cross words or mickey-taking in any England team I have played in — or watched — to be bullying.

Yes, the England team is a tough school but if you can’t cope with a few tough words from your team-mates how are you going to cope with Mitchell Johnson and Brad Haddin?

But I do agree with some of what Pietersen has said. I have long disagreed with how often the England bowlers would have a go at anyone who misfielded or dropped a catch and I was amazed at how long that was allowed to continue.

Apart from anything else it plays into the hands of the opposition. They will look at that and say: ‘We’ve got this lot on the run. They are at each other.’ It just wasn’t a good look and I’m glad that there seems less of that sort of thing now.

Nasser Hussain tried to embrace ‘difficult characters' like Phil Tufnell when he was England captain

And if it is true that people had to stand up in front of the group and apologise when they made a mistake then England should be careful. That really is school yard stuff.

The flip side is that you want your team to be challenged and pushed to make sure they perform to the best of their ability, and it is not always the captain or the coach who does the challenging.

For me, it would hit a lot harder if one of my team-mates, rather than the coach or captain, had a word with me after something and said: ‘Come on Nas, you can do better than that.’ Clearly, this England team pushed each other hard and it seems Pietersen didn’t like to be treated in that way.

It does seem that England may have had a tendency to overdo the methods that took them to three Ashes triumphs and No 1 in the world Test rankings. The admonishing of players in the field is one example. Another is their reliance on statistics when, at times, they should have trusted their cricketing instinct more.

When I was captain I would try to embrace the so-called ‘difficult characters’ and do everything to concentrate on what they could do rather than what they couldn’t. If people like Phil Tufnell, Caddick and Graham Thorpe could take wickets and score runs for us then they were fine by me.

You have to treat everyone differently. Pietersen and Alastair Cook have almost identical career records and are two of the best batsmen England have ever had, but as human beings they could not be more different and have to be treated as such. The key with KP, clearly, was trying to keep him happy and make him feel loved.

But coach Andy Flower will tell you he did that for five years, he treated Pietersen differently and did everything to manage him and get him onside so England would benefit from the match-winning innings of which he was capable.

It’s all very well people saying Kevin was easy to manage when he first came into the side but he would have been wouldn’t he? He was a young player finding his way and there’s no way he would have challenged anyone senior.

Pietersen's lucrative contract with Indian Premier League had repercussions for England team

Where everything clearly changed is with the advent of the Indian Premier League. It seemed to make Pietersen believe he was bigger than the team, and perhaps other players became jealous of the money he was making. The dynamic of one of the most successful of all England teams clearly changed.

Flower had tired of repeatedly trying to manage Pietersen. When results started going against England and their star batsman was not quite looking like the player he once was, England decided enough was enough.

As I have said, there are some valid points here but nearly everyone who has tried to manage him has found him incredibly hard work. Everybody can’t be wrong.

So maybe one day Kevin Pietersen might take a look at himself rather than blaming everyone else for the way he has been treated by England. He might have to look back and say: ‘Was it me?’
