The miracle dog that wagged its tail after surviving a gas chamber, warming the nation's heart, has been given his own float at a New Year’s Day parade.

Daniel, a beagle mix named after the biblical figure who survived the lion’s den, was six months old when he was placed with 17 other dogs into a stainless steel box in Alabama filled with carbon monoxide.

Now, at the age of two, the animal – 
described as ‘one of the most joyous, happy dogs’ – is to star in the 
Rose Parade, held in Pasadena, California, which is one of the United 
States’ biggest celebrations.

After Daniel survived his gas chamber in Florence, Alabama, he was adopted by Joe Dwyer from New Jersey

The box which Daniel was put in to, roughly the size of a pickup 
truck bed, was filled with carbon monoxide - however Daniel emerged 
frightened but unscathed, still wagging his tail after the scary 
experience.

Following the media storm that ensued Daniel the 'miracle' dog was immediately adopted by Joe Dwyer, a motivational speaker from Nutley, New Jersey.

Mr Dwyer described Daniel as 'one of the most joyous, happy dogs I've ever met in my life'

The Rose Parade attracts thousands of people to Pasadena, California, every New Year's Day

‘He's in extremely good shape, 
especially in light of what he went through,’ his new owner Joe Dwyer, 
50, said when he got his dog.

‘His attitude is just incredible.’His owner said Daniel’s story of 
survival and thriving has prompted laws in 31 states that protect 
shelter animals against inhumane forms of euthanasia.

Daniel, who will be on the float along with seven other dogs, will perform his ‘high five to keep pets alive’ trick and perform with his companions.

The float is sponsored by the Lucy Pet Foundation, which runs mobile spay, neuter and adoption clinics across the United States.

Mr Dwyer said Daniel has been chosen as a ‘spokesdog’ for the organisation.

‘He's definitely one of the most joyous, happy dogs I've ever met in my life,’ his owner said.

‘I think his positive attitude is why he's survived.’

The popular Rose Parade is known and watched across the United States.

It has been running for nearly 125 years and hundreds of thousands of people visit Pasadena for the show each year.
