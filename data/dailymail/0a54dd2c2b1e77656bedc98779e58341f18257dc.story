Street artist John Dolan's dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier named George, is more than just a pet -  he's a lifesaver.

The East Londoner credits the pooch with turning his life around after he hit rock bottom as a depressed drug addict sleeping rough.

Today, John, 43, is completely unrecognisable from the description he gives of his former self - 'a proper homeless rough tramp'.

Street artist: John Dolan shows off an example of his work alongside his beloved dog George

He's now an accomplished artist with a forthcoming exhibition in L.A and creates work that can fetch thousands.

And he's also turned his hand to writing, penning his memoirs which is now to be published as John and George: The Dog Who Changed My Life.

He told MailOnline: 'I have to pinch myself sometimes. It all
 happened so quickly: two years ago I was sat on the street with my paper 
cup and now look at me.'

His change in fortunes is all thanks to the arrival in his life of George - who not only became his pet but also his muse and his saviour.

All change: John used to wrap George in a coat to keep him warm during their time living rough together

Man's best friend: John credits his Staffordshire Bull Terrier George with saving his life

John 
explains how he had ended up on the streets following a spell in prison 
for stealing. 'It all started when I was 19,' he remembers.

'I
 was bought up by my grandparents and I was getting into trouble. I was 
rebelling from a young age, the amount of times we had the police 
through our door was ridiculous.

'I just kept getting into more and more trouble and eventually I went to jail. When I came out of jail, I was homeless. I would stay in hostels and bed and breakfasts three nights here and there.'

It was at one shelter in 2010 that another homeless couple asked John if he would look after George, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier they had found abandoned who was fearful of humans.

'They already had a dog so they asked me if I would mind taking care of him, and it was completely spur of the moment but I said yes,' John recalls.

It was the best decision he ever made, as taking on George - and thinking about the needs of someone other than himself - lifted him out of depression and drug addiction.

He said: 'I was suffering from a wave of drug addiction, I would take heroin to deal with my depression because I just didn't know how else to cope with it. I could barely look after myself.

'That dog is like an angel, he turned my 
life around. I've had relationships before when I've said to myself "I 
will change for this girl" but it never happens. But having George was 
like having a child and I had to keep a roof over our heads, not for me 
but for him. He really made me pull my jeans up.'

He added: 'I would sit out on the street in Shoreditch and sit George in front of a paper cup so it looked like he was begging or if it was cold I would wrap him up.

Heartwarming tale: John has written a book of his experience

'If it hadn't been for George I would have either been dead or in jail - I owe everything to that dog.'

During his time on the streets, John began sketching the scenes around him as well as George and it wasn't long before his artistic talent was noticed.

'It all happened really quickly,' he says. 'I used to sketch builders from over the road but then once I had George I would sketch him. Word started to get about and I was invited on local radio stations and people used to come and see me.

'I started selling my drawings and they went down quite well in Shoreditch. An agent heard about me and came to see me and that's when I had my first exhibition. I collaborated with 46 other artists and the exhibition was a sell-out. I sold one of my originals for £2,500 which is more than what Banksy was getting when he started out.'

No longer homeless but still based in Shoreditch, John now does a lot of work for charities including UNICEF, the Big Issue and Battersea Dogs Home as well as staging exhibitions.

Last month, his work was displayed at the Howard Griffin Gallery in Shoreditch while he was also involved with the Museum of London's The City We Live in Festival  

He hopes his story can inspire others and remind them that there's always hope, no matter how bleak life seems.

'I was at a point in my life where I was the least likely person to turn my life around,' he explains. 'I would be sat out on the street with my fingers blue to the bone and now look at me. If I can do it, anybody can.'
