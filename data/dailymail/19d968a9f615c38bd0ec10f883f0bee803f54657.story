A woman from Nashville who allowed her young daughter to be beaten to death has pleaded guilty to reckless homicide and aggravated child neglect after she failed to protect the toddler.

Neena Costanza, 22, accepted a plea deal to serve 30 percent of a 20-year sentence — with a chance for parole that means she could be free within six years.

Little Eloise Costanza was just 17-months-old when she died after being beaten up by her boyfriend Jacob Scott Hughes, 23, who is already in jail and awaiting trial for the toddlers' murder.

The man caused head trauma, skull fractures and brain swelling that killed the child while Costanza was at work.

Despite
 her seeing all the injuries that were being caused to Eloise, Costanza 
did nothing to prevent further harm from coming to the child.

'Everyone has an obligation to protect these little children,' Assistant District Attorney Brian Holmgren said Thursday.

On
 the day the child was fatally injured, Costanza was working at a Sonic 
drive-in and received Facebook messages and photos from Hughes showing a
 large bump on the child’s cheek and a soiled diaper.

Arrest: Jacob Hughes was arrested last July and charged with Eloise's 
murder. Now his girlfriend has pleaded guilty to similar charges after the 17-month -old girl was found unresponsive and covered 
in bruises

Hughes sent a message about the child struggling to breathe through Facebook.

Costanza called 911 and rushed back home but by that time, the child had suffered more severe injuries.

The
 police report states that paramedics found the child covered in bruises
 and unresponsive. Hughes has said the child received her injuries in a 
fall.

The girl died the next day at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

The medical examiner ruled the child's death from severe head trauma was a homicide.

Whilst
 Hughes was arrested and indicted soon after the child died, it wasn't 
until month later that police decided to arrest Costanza.

Police
 found that she had allowed the girl to be abused for weeks despite 
being confronted by her mother and grandmother about the injuries.

She had even mentioned the abuse to co-workers, and had images on a cellphone of bruises on the child.

Costanza had also called the police a month before the child’s death to report a domestic assault by Hughes.

After pleading guilty, her defense attorney David Raybin said she failed to protect her daughter but was herself being abused.

'People should understand,' he said, 'that domestic violence has consequences.'
