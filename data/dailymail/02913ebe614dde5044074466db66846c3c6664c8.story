His parents are undoubtedly one of the most famous and best loved couples in the world.

But as the Beckham family sat centre stage at Elton John’s winter wedding yesterday it wasn’t Victoria and David getting all the attention, it was their 15-year-old son, Brooklyn.

Looking dapper in a navy suit and tie, gone was the baby-faced teenager and in his place was a stylish young man, seemingly well on his way to adulthood.

Brooklyn Beckham has become increasingly famous in his own right in 2014. He posted this picture of himself and his designer mother, Victoria, at Elton John's wedding to his new Instagram account on Sunday

Over the last twelve months it is safe to say that Brooklyn has done some pretty serious growing up.

Now, far from being over-shadowed by his parents' fame, it seems his is well on the way to becoming a celebrity in his own right. 

When he posted a picture of himself and his designer mother at the wedding to his recently opened Instagram account it garnered over three thousand likes in just a few hours.

Likes which some might say are pretty symbolic of his growing popularity - Brooklyn only opened his account a few weeks ago and already he has over 12,000 followers. 

Brooklyn attended the Harper's Bazaar Women Of The Year Awards in November 2013 as his mother's plus 1

Earlier this year Brooklyn sat front row at his mother's SS2015 show in New York alongside his father, David Beckham and Vogue editor Anna Wintour 

Brooklyn's transformation first started in November 2013. When Victoria took him as her date to the Harper's Bazaar Women of the year awards, proudly showing him off to the press. 

Then in September he made headlines when he hit the FROW at his mother's SS2015 show in New York, taking a coveted seat alongside his famous father and Vogue head honcho Anna Wintour. 

In October he even took part in his first ever solo photo shoot for New York Times Style Magazine, looking very much the spitting image of his famous father.

His rumoured relationship with Chloe Moretz, 17- neither part have confirmed or denied that they are together - has also helped to boost his profile.

The pair have regularly been spotted out and about together. Chloe has described Brooklyn as: 'A very good guy,' adding, 'I like hanging out with him.

Brooklyn has been a regular at public events for his whole life. Here he's pictured at Wimbledon in 2010 (left) and at the premiere of Scooby Doo 2 in 2004 (right)

Earlier this month he was photographed leaving red carpet event, ‘A Night With Nick,’ along with singer Talia Storm and blogger Tessie Hartmann.

One of a handful of appearances this year where neither his mother or father played chaperone. He also attended the premiere of If I Stay (in which Chloe stars) without them in Hollywood in August. 

But despite this move into the limelight Brooklyn, it seems, remains grounded. In fact, it has been widely reported that he has a job in a local coffee shop which apparently pays him just £2.68 an hour.

He is also a hands-on big brother to his younger siblings Cruz, nine, and Romeo, 12, and sister Harper, three, often photographed carrying and cuddling her.

And he still enjoys the same hobbies that most young teenagers enjoy such as skateboarding and hanging out with his friends. Unlike most teenagers though, Brooklyn does have a superstar sporting legend as a father, and he is tipped to follow in his dad David’s footballing footsteps.

It was reported in November that he will join Arsenal’s training academy in March when he turns 16. He already plays for the Under 16’s team and trains at the clubs grounds regularly
