Syrian President Bashar al Assad has vowed to destroy his country's chemical weapons stockpile.

The doctor-turned-dictator insisted that he has not used chemical weapon and rejected the findings of the United Nations report that declared that an attack involving sarin gas did occur in the country on August 21.

But, in a sign that he may be seeking a diplomatic thaw with the West after decades of acrimony, he said his government would abide by a U.S.-Russian agreement to
dispose of Syria's chemical weapons and hand them over to whatever 
nation was willing to take them.

He added that the operation to destroy the weapons will cost about $1 billion and take approximately one year to complete.

Promise: Syrian President Bashar al Assad has vowed to destroy his country's stockpile of chemical weapons

Horror: Hundreds of children were killed in the attack which reportedly rained nerve gas upon thousands near the Syrian capital of Damascus

In an interview on the Fox News television channel, Assad said: 'I think it is a very complicated operation technically and it needs a lot, a lot of money. Some estimated about a billion for the Syrian stockpile.'

Asked whether he would be willing to hand over chemical weapons to the U.S. government, Assad said: 'As I said, it needs a lot of money. It needs about one billion. It is very detrimental to the environment. If the American administration is ready to pay this money and take the responsibility of bringing toxic materials to the United States, why don't they do it?'

Assad denied that his forces were responsible for a chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, outside Damascus, on August 21 that brought the United States close to attacking Syria in response.

He did not deny that the attack 
occurred - saying that 'it's despicable, it's a crime' - but he did 
clearly try to distance his forces from any culpability.

Indignant: Syrian President Bashar al Assad used his latest televised interview to say that there is still no evidence that his soldiers used chemical weapons

Under attack: Assad maintained that the government was continually being attacked by outside terrorist groups who are masquerading as internal opposition forces

'Sarin gas is called the kitchen gas you know why? because you can make it anywhere,' he said.

Assad
said that the evidence cited in the United Nations report was not all 
of the proof and did not prove that the weapons were used by his armed 
forces.

He said the Syrian army was advancing in the area at the time and had no need to fire rockets filled with the nerve agent sarin, as the United States says it did.

'The whole story doesn't even hold together. It's not realistic. So, no, we didn't. In one word, we didn't use any chemical weapons in Ghouta,' he said.

U.N. chemical investigators confirmed on Monday the use of sarin in the attack in a long-awaited report that the United States, Britain and France said proved government forces were responsible.

Assad said it was too early to make a definitive comment on the U.N. report.

Attacks: The chemical gas attacks occurred on August 21 in the rebel strongholds near Demascus and was thought to have left more than 1,000 dead

'We have to look at it. We have to discuss it before saying if we agree or disagree. It was only yesterday evening,' he said.

Asked whether he had a message for President Barack Obama, Assad said: 'Listen to your people. Follow the common sense of your people. That's enough,' in an apparent reference to opinion polls that show Americans oppose any U.S. strike on Syria.

Former U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, a liberal Democrat and eight-term congressman from Ohio who is now a commentator for Fox News, took part in the interview on Tuesday in Damascus along with Fox senior correspondent Greg Palkot.

Kucinich has visited Assad twice before, most recently in June 2011, after the uprising against the Syrian president began. Syrian media quoted Kucinich as saying on that trip that Assad was 'highly loved' by Syrians. The congressman said he had been misquoted.
