Forget the iPad, you'd be better off giving your children Play-Doh to keep them entertained on a plane, according to new research.

A social experiment led by Professor Robert Winston found that old-fashioned fun is all you need to keep children happy in-flight - contrary to popular belief.

The research comes as parents revealed that their biggest concern when flying was keeping their children entertained, with 60 per cent admitting they fail to keep kids distracted for more than 30 minutes.

A quarter of parents surveyed said they 
worried about their children disturbing other passengers, while more 
than half were nervous about disrupting their youngster’s sleeping 
pattern.

British Airways conducted the social experiment in response to the survey, by placing 30 youngsters on a flight for two hours with a selection of toys.

The children, aged two to 10, were given 90 minutes playtime and observed by scientist and TV personality Robert Winston and a team of educational psychologists.

The surprising findings revealed that it was actually the cheapest toys that kept the children occupied for the longest.

1.    Loom Bands2.    Playdoh3.    Lego4.    Top Trumps5.    Uno6.    Usborne Activity Cards7.    Magnetic travel game 8.    Aquadoodle! 9.    Finger puppets 10.  Sticker book

Play-Doh and toy-of-the-moment Loom Bands topped the list with 80 per cent of children and 70 per cent of parents saying they would take these on a flight in the future.

Both toys, costing just 74p and £1.99 respectively, kept more than half of the children occupied for longer than 40 minutes.

The most popular toy among two to five year olds was Play-Doh, while Loom Bands were a firm favourite with the five to 10 year olds.

Timeless classics such as Lego and Top Trump cards also scored highly with this age group; keeping them entertained for an average of 37 and 33 minutes respectively.

Professor Winston, said: 'Although the temptation is for parents to play a film in the hope that their child falls asleep, activity based toys, such as lego, sticker books and travel games are also a great way to keep them engaged.

'Bringing out a different toy at regular intervals is guaranteed to keep them quiet for longer than 90 minutes.'

Simple pleasures: The study, which also included participant Archie Sturt, 3, with his mother Nicola Sturt, found children don't need high-tech games to be entertained

1.  Have drinks to hand they can sip on for take off and landing so they 
don't concentrate on the air pressure; which can affect children more 
than adults2.  Buy new toys and games for the flight as newer toys entertain them for longer3.  Bring out different toys at regular intervals. Wrapping them and giving them as presents works really well4.  Concentrate on packing activities as opposed to static objects such as dolls and cuddly toys 5.  Think of games with extended play. Finger puppets and activity cards 
are both toys that can be drawn out to last a lot longer6.  Think about games that you don't need to carry. Verbal games like I Spy
 and Twenty Questions are good ways to pass the flight time7.  If it's an evening or night flight take pyjamas. Getting children ready
 for bed will help avoid disrupting their sleep pattern.

Dr Vivian Hill, educational psychologist from the Institute of Education, said: 'Toys that spark the imagination and encourage creativity, rather than static toys like soft toys and dolls, are proven to keep children occupied for sustained periods.'

Ian Ellis, toys buyer at John Lewis, said: 'Loom bands have been hugely popular. We started selling them at John Lewis a couple of months ago and in the last few weeks we have really seen them take off. It has been such a big playground phenomenon with children wanting the newest colours and sets, we will be introducing more to our range as the trend continues.'
