At least 21 people were gored or trampled on the latest day of carnage at the Pamplona bull run, including an Irishman who suffered serious chest injuries.

In shocking scenes broadcast live on Spanish television, there was a huge crush when the animals charged a crowd at the narrow entrance to the bullring, officials said.

As the huge animals thundered into the entrance of the tunnel, they were blocked by a mound of dozens of people who had fallen and were piled on top of one another.

One bull that had fallen before the entrance got up and charged into the clogged passageway. Two steers jumped over the pile of people as they began to get up and flee.

Runners were shown being trampled while the bulls tried to climb over them from behind.

The Irish man is thought to have been asphyxiated after suffering a chest injury in the crush.

The blockage ended after attendants managed to let the beasts escape through a side door normally reserved for matadors.

Javier Sesma, a health spokesman for Navarra province, said two of the 21 injured people were gored by bulls and that the others were hurt in the stampede.

Mr Sesma said one runner, a 19-year-old Spaniard from Vitoria city, was seriously injured when his thorax was crushed at the bull ring entrance.

'It is a very grave situation. He's in a stable condition, but it's very serious,' Mr Sesma said of the Spaniard.

One person was gored in his buttock and another in an armpit during the 928-yard dash through Pamplona's narrow streets, the official said.

On Friday, the festival drew widespread attention when a American college student Patrick Eccles, 20, and two Spaniards were gored, and videos and photos of the attacks were seen around the world.

Each morning, six fighting bulls and six bell-tinkling steers that try to keep the beasts together head from stables to the ring where matadors will star in late afternoon bullfights.

The last fatal goring happened in 2009.

The festivities end today.
