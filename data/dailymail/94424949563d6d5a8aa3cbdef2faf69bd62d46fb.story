A wealthy widow accused of killing her Wall Street tycoon husband inside their luxury Costa Rican retreat in 2010 is now facing a new trial after her recent acquittal had been thrown out.

Ann Bender, nee Patton, was cleared of her husband John's murder last January, but a judicial panel recently overturned the verdict on appeal citing inconsistencies, setting the stage for a retrial.

The Benders moved to Costa Rica in 1998 and spent four years building an elaborate secluded compound on 5,000 acres of land in the heart of the Costa Rican jungle, complete with a circular glass house atop a mountain overlooking a 600-foot waterfall.

The couple's dream of a peaceful life in a remote exotic locale came crashing down in January 2010, when John Bender, 44, was found dead in his bedroom from a gunshot wound to the back of the head, the magazine Outside Online reported.

Ann Bender, then 39 years old, insisted from the outset that her husband - who much like her had suffered from manic depression for most of his life – killed himself.

However, police investigating the murder were sceptical, and within weeks the woman had been charged with first-degree murder.

Bender, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Brazilian origin, went on trial January 14, 2012, testifying that at 12.15am on January 8, 2010, she woke up in her fourth-floor master bedroom to find her husband naked and holding a gun.

According to the woman, when she attempted to wrestle away the pistol, it fired a bullet that struck John Bender in the back of the head.

'He told me that he was tired of living such a hard life with all that he had gone through, he said he was afraid of hurting someone, and that he believed that I was safer without him,' the widow said in court, according to Inside Costa Rica.

The story of John and Ann Bender's marriage reads like a pulp fiction novel packed with every trope of the genre: astounding wealth, tales of alleged diamond smuggling and bouts of madness set against the backdrop of a tropical paradise.

As Outside Online reported in a lengthy profile in June, Ann Patton met John Bender, a brilliant yet troubled Wall Street investor, in March of 1998 in Virginia. From their first encounter, the couple bonded over their struggle with bipolar disorder and depression.

Mr Bender, the son of a high-ranking Justice Department official, ran several arbitrage funds and had a personal net worth upward of $600million. He was well on his way to becoming a billionaire when in 2000 he suffered a stroke.

Around the same time, the successful investor cashed out and decided to move to Costa Rica, where he and his wife  - both avid outdoorsmen and nature lovers - planned to create a sprawling ecological preserve.

The couple settled in the remote jungle town of Baru, Perez Zeledon, in Costa Rica, where they purchased 5,000 acres of land for $10million.

After renouncing their U.S. citizenship and becoming permanent residents in their adoptive country, John and Ann got down to business of building the home of their dreams.

Four years and more than $2million later, the Benders were living in a breathtaking nine-room, five-story, 8,000-square-foot glass mansion, which came with an elevator, helipad and moat.

The Benders’ secure compound also boasted a sculpture garden and reflected pool stocked with fish.

But the couple’s seemingly idyllic life in a utopian setting also had its dark moments.

John and Ann continued struggling with their demons and would administer homemade remedies to one another in hopes of getting a handle on their mental health problems.

The wealthy expats also were not strangers to paranoia, which set in after a 2002 incident involving an armed man who fired on the Benders’ compound.

John Bender went on a mission to fortify their property, which he stocked with a number of guns, including a pair of illegally purchased AK-47s.

The interior of the palatial home was lit with 550 Tiffany lamps, and the house was crammed with over 3,000 diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires worth $8.5million.

When officials later came to seize property from the residence, they ended up hauling away four suitcases bursting at the seams with precious gems, which were too numerous to count.

In a separate case, Bender was later accused of smuggling black-market gems – a charge she has vehemently denied.  

According to local reports, the millionairess had been suspected of bringing piles of jewels from Africa to sell them at exclusive auctions held at her home.

After a week-long trial last January, a Cost Rican court acquitted Mrs Bender, but the prosecution announced that it would appeal the verdict - a move that would not have been allowed under the U.S. legal system, but is acceptable in Costa Rica.

Last month, a three-judge panel called for a new trial based on the assertion that the judges in the original trial had ignored a number of major discrepancies in the case, among them John Bender's position at the time of death, which was said to be inconsistent with suicide, and lack of gunpowder residue on his hands.

Ann Bender has riled against the ruling, calling it a 'persecution' against her and her dead husband.
