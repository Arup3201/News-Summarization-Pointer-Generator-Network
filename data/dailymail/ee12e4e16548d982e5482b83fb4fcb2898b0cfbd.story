A new attempt to persuade MPs and peers to back a right-to-die law has been branded ‘Orwellian’ by one of the country’s leading lawyers.

Lord Falconer, the former Labour Lord Chancellor, wants to legalise ‘assisted dying’ for terminally ill patients.

But he has been accused of using ‘Orwellian spin’ by attempting to distinguish between ‘assisted suicide’ and ‘assisted dying’. Critics say there is no difference between the two.

Lord Alex Carlile QC, left, said the terms of Lord Falconer's, right, bill are based on 'euphemisms' and criticised an attempt to call doctors helping a patient to die as 'assisted dying' rather than 'assisted suicide'

Among his critics was leading Liberal 
Democrat peer Lord Carlile, who said that giving doctors power to help 
terminally ill people to die ‘would not pass the public safety test’.

Lord Carlile, a prominent QC, said in a
newspaper article: ‘Advocates of such a law tell us that they are not 
talking about suicide. They say that helping people who are terminally 
ill to end their lives is not assisting suicide because they are 
expected to die.

‘This is, of course, nonsense. In law,
as in the English language, if you take your own life, whatever your 
state of health, that is suicide; and a doctor or anyone else who 
supplies you with the means to do so is assisting suicide.

‘Sound lawmaking demands clarity. It cannot be based on euphemisms, verbal evasions or Orwellian spin.’

Lord Falconer was also accused of 
exploiting the impact of right-to-die court cases involving terribly 
disabled people to win support for the proposal.

Critics said its timing had been 
‘carefully planned’ to coincide with the hearing of the case of Paul 
Lamb, 57, a severely disabled former lorry driver, who is seeking 
permission for a doctor to kill him by lethal injection.

Dr Peter Saunders, a campaigner 
against euthanasia, said: ‘Lord Falconer is using the emotions generated
by hard court cases, but his agenda is very dangerous for disabled and 
elderly people.’

Lord Falconer is planning to table his
Private Member’s Bill before peers on Wednesday. It will allow adults 
with six months or less to live to request a doctor’s help to commit 
suicide, and supporters say it is bound around with safeguards to 
prevent abuse.

His Bill follows a report produced 
last year under his leadership which made a similar call for assisted 
suicide for the terminally ill. The report said help to die should be 
available for anyone with 12 months to live, but following widespread 
criticism that has been cut down to six months.

It will be the third Parliamentary 
attempt in seven years to legalise assisted dying. Peers rejected calls 
for legalisation in 2006 and 2009.

This week, judges in the Court of 
Appeal will begin hearing Mr Lamb’s case, and the case of a man known 
only as Martin, a victim of locked-in syndrome. Mr Lamb, who is 
quadriplegic, has taken over the claim of Tony Nicklinson, another 
locked-in syndrome victim, who died shortly after losing his case in the
High Court last year.

Martin is claiming that assisted 
suicide laws – which set a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail for 
helping someone kill themselves – break Article Eight of the European 
human rights charter, which protects the right to privacy and family 
life.

Dr Saunders said: ‘The timing has been
carefully planned. Off the back of media coverage of this case, 
Falconer, who is being backed by Dignity in Dying, the former Voluntary 
Euthanasia Society, will argue that his proposal is modest in 
comparison.

‘Lamb is not terminally ill and wants a
doctor to give him a lethal injection. Falconer, however, is only 
asking for people who are terminally ill to have the right to receive 
help to kill themselves – assisted suicide.’

Dr Saunders added: ‘The last thing we 
need is a change in the law to put more pressure on people who already 
feel themselves to be a burden to others.’

Assisted suicide laws were effectively
reformed without any Parliamentary vote by Keir Starmer, the director 
of public prosecutions, in 2010. Following instructions passed down in 
one of the last cases heard by the Law Lords, Mr Starmer issued 
guidelines that said no-one is likely to be prosecuted for helping 
someone to die if they are a family member or friend, rather than a 
professional, and if they act out of compassion and not greed.

Between 150 and 200 people are thought
to have gone to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to be helped to 
commit suicide. But no family member who helped has ever been 
prosecuted.
