Celtic risk being haunted by ‘disgrace’ and ‘shame’ if they fail to beat one of the weakest Rangers teams in Old Firm history, according to former Ibrox regular Bert Konterman.

The Dutchman, scorer of a Treble-wrecking League Cup semi-final winner against Celtic back in 2002, is under no illusions about who should win Sunday’s Hampden clash.

But he believes that the pressure of trying to avoid humiliation – and virulent abuse from their own fans – could work against Ronny Deila’s men, declaring: ‘If Celtic lose on Sunday it’s a disgrace for them.

‘They would be slaughtered for half a year by all the fans. It would last until they win the league and get going in the Champions League qualifiers again.

‘Celtic is stronger than Rangers because they play in a higher league and have more money. They have to win – they have to. If they don’t, it will be a shame on them.

‘If you are making a prediction then you’d put all your money on Celtic. Celtic are the biggest club, they have the money so Rangers are the underdogs. In some ways that makes it easier for them, they can just focus on playing their game.

‘The Rangers fans want to see their team win, of course, but they also just want to see a team playing a committed as they can be. If they do that, they’ ll get a standing ovation from the fans.

‘It’s a chance for Rangers to test themselves against old rivals, but there is no pressure because everyone expects Celtic to win.’
