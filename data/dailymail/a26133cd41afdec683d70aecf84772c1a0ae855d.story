A coffee shop worker who wrote scathing posts about customers and his boss on his 'Bitter Barista' website has been named online and fired from his job.

Matt Watson, 30, had worked at All City Coffee in Georgetown, Seattle for two-and-a-half years before he launched the blog complaining about demanding customers two weeks ago.

Despite his insistence that the website was satirical and that he has a great relationship with 95 per cent of customers, Watson's boss Seth Levy fired him after he was outed by a website in Portland.

Watson, who earns $15 an hour and starts work at 6 a.m. to support his hip hop dreams as the act 'Spekulation', started getting thousands of hits after setting the blog live.

'If you remind me four times that you’ve ordered decaf, guess what you won’t be getting...' he wrote.

'What a coincidence! You have a gluten allergy, and I don’t care that you have a gluten allergy!' another message read.

'Lemme know where you work and I'll be sure to stop in early tomorrow morning to tell you how to do your job too,' another bitter post said.

And targeting his boss, he added: 'I like to use a lot of big words when I
tweet, that way if my boss ever finds my twitter account, he won’t 
understand any of it.'

After he set the blog live, it started attracting thousands of hits a day - but it also attracted the attention of Zachary Carlsen and Jordan Michelman of coffee gossip website Sprudge.com.

On a post
last Thursday, they named Watson as the barista behind the blog after 
noticing his Spekulation Twitter account linked to his 'new blog' - 
Bitter Barista.

'My
ex-boss thinks the website is gonna stop because I don't work there 
anymore. Man, I didn't even work there when I worked there!'

'Don't cry over spilled milk? I'm not crying about the milk! Do you see where I work?!'

'I really hope this coffee career takes off so I can finally stop making music'

'Lemme know where you work and I'll be sure to stop in early tomorrow morning to tell you how to do your job too'

'You can say '2% milk' all damn day. You're getting whole milk

'I would remember your usual drink if you were a more memorable person'

'If you bring your dog into the cafe and it starts fighting with another dog, you can't be that upset with me when I start taking bets'

'Oh, you want THAT blueberry scone, noth THIS blueberry scone? Well, don't worry, that doesn't make me hate you at all'

'There's
a lot of anger in this blog,' it wrote. 'While we love the well-worn 
barista cliche, it should be the stuff of mild parody, not an all-out 
assault on whomever walks through the door of your cafe.'

Watson
emailed Levy after the Sprudge post, explaining that 'the very few 
customers who have seen the website, are huge fans', according to the Seattle Times.

'I'm just saying it could turn out to be a fun something that gives the place a little spike in publicity,' he wrote - but his boss did not see it that way.

'He was writing about his boss during business hours,' Levy said. 'I represent the business, the customers and the staff. I can’t endorse what he was saying, whether humorous or not.'

Despite Watson's messages, he told the Times he thought highly of his boss and the majority of the customers who came to the coffee shop.

He was just referencing 'the five percent who I guess make our job 
more difficult and don’t treat us as human beings,' he said.

In fact, when you see a barista, 'that person is probably an artist, overqualified, people with pretty much college education across the board', he said.

As well as his work as a hip hop artist, Watson, who is married, has a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Lehigh University in Pennsylvania.

Not the end: Watson, 30, said he has been offered jobs by several other coffee houses

While he said his boss had 'every right' to fire him, he was less understanding of the bloggers who outed him on Sprudge.com.

'It's actually like the Twitter coffee culture which is why I was so surprised that I was targetted and they just didn't understand that it was satirical,' he told Kiro7 in Seattle.

'The guys who wrote the article compared me to one of the Columbine shooters which is like really crazy.'

Despite the scathing messages, Watson has already received several offers from other coffee shops, and he hopes to put together a Bitter Barista coffee-table book.
