As well as love, trust and laughter, physical intimacy is a vital factor in any relationship.

But one woman who suffers from a rare illness that left her with unbearable pain after sex was forced go without, and had to end her marriage as a result. And now she's sharing her painful tale to help others.

Leonie Blackwell, 50, suffered from Human Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity, which caused burning, swelling, pain and irritation during sexual intercourse.

Speaking about the first time she experienced the agony, the Australian told MailOnline: 'It began when I was 23 years old. I 
had no idea what was causing such pain, swelling and burning.'

Sharing her tale: Leonie Blackwell, 50, discovered that she was allergic to semen when she was 23 years old and has penned a novel to share her tale

She continued: 'I still 
remember the first day it happened - and 27 years have passed. I really 
needed a doctor to give me answers and when they couldn’t, it compounded 
the experience. It was confusing but it was also terrifying.

'Back then very little was known about it and it took me five medical professionals, including three gynaecologists, and two and a half years before I found someone who could tell me what was wrong with me.'

Initially it caused cervical dysplasia, and Leonie noticed cells shedding. While this was treated the pain and swelling continued, but no one could explain why.

'I went on in search of answers. Sadly when none were forthcoming I was told it was in my head. By this time the pain was getting worse as was the swelling and burning. I was living in constant pain. I knew it was real I just needed a medical doctor to confirm it. I decided to investigate it myself.'

While scouring every gynecological book she could get my hands on, Leonie found a couple of sentences that talked about reactions to semen.

'It was like a light bulb went on, and it enabled me to break down in my mind the reaction I was having instead of being lost in the pain. I realised that was it. Now I had to find someone who would believe me and help me,' she said.

Confused: It took Leonie, pictured before her illness, five medical professionals, including three gynaecologists, and two and a half years before she found someone who could tell her what was wrong

Eventually she found a gynaecologist who, without even testing her, listened to her symptoms and said it sounded like she had an allergy to her husband’s semen.

'In that moment I was elated. I had an answer. Now let’s test and confirm it then move on to fixing it was my dominating thought,' said Leonie, who lives in Victoria.

The testing process back then was rudimentary, but the conclusion was undeniable. Eagerly she awaited the good news that he had a solution.

'Sadly he informed me that while he could tell me what was wrong with me he had no way of treating it. I was to “live like this for the rest of my life".'

Up to 12 per cent of women experience an allergy to the semen of men

By this time she was having an anaphylactic reaction. The intensity of her allergy was extreme. The doctor’s solution was to use condoms, but the latex created an allergic reaction of its own.

Leonie's illness began to affect her marriage.

'The
 most difficult part for my husband was that he had no symptoms and wasn’t ill 
in any way. It was all happening to me. It was a mortifying experience 
for him to find out that it was his semen that caused the reaction.

'You 
can only imagine how a man would feel. An act of love caused torturous 
pain - not something two young people know how to handle.

'Stuck with a lifelong diagnosis with no solution we were both devastated. Life dreams were wiped. We decided to separate,' said Leonie.

But she couldn’t give up and turned to natural therapies to find out if there was something that could be done for her.

Helping hand: Leonie has written a book which delves into the injustices of life and how to deal with them positively, to help others

She said: 'While it was important for me to 
physically heal and stop my immune system from attacking normal human 
proteins, I also had to heal the emotional heartache this experience 
bought with it. I have called this experience my own personal Greek 
Tragedy, in light of the Greek Mythology stories.

'I
 lived with constant pain for seven years and four months, and it was eight
years after my diagnosis that a product came out on the market in 
Australia that switched off my auto-immune systems response.

'That 
product was Reiishi Mushroom Extract. It is thanks to this product that I
 am well today with no signs of having Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity 
anymore.'

It was this experience that led her to follow a career as a Naturopath specialising in emotional well-being.

Leonie has now been working as a Naturopath for
 20 years, and writing of her book - Making Sense of the Insensible: The Ten Injustices of Our Life Lessons, which explores ten injustices and how to deal with them positively - is the next step for her to help 
more people.

'I really hope people will read my book and gain fresh 
insight and feel empowered to understand their lives through new eyes 
that motivate them to live as their best possible self. I will continue 
to help people have babies and raise them as consciously as they can.

'It
 has been an amazing journey over the last 25 years, and I look forward 
to what my future will consist of because I have made a full recovery 
from my illness.

Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) is a wild mushroom that favors decaying logs in coastal China.

The mushroom's active ingredients, called ganoderic acids, appear to combat high blood pressure and reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

They may also discourage blood platelets from clumping together, thus reducing the risk of dangerous clots.

Preliminary research has shown immune modulating, anti-aging, cardiovascular, antiviral, antibacterial, hypoglycemic, and hepatoprotective effects.

Reishi has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 4,000 years to treat asthma, cough, fatigue, insomnia, and weakness.

'While I may never get to be a mother myself, I do want 
to express my capacity to love, care, support and nurture others to be 
their best every day through my work.

'My experiences were rare, and I felt that
 the story in itself would resonate with people but may not be something
 they have personal experience of. I wanted to take the emotional 
experience of injustice and relate it to life in general.

'I may have 
experienced much of what I write about through this experience and 
others in my life, but the emotional impact, the choices I made, and the way 
in which I was able to grow beyond the experience and be true to myself 
and live a valuable life helping others be their best was something we 
all share.

'My marriage may have ended 25 years ago and feel like a 
life time away, but I also remember much of that time like it was yesterday.
 Anyone who has lived through dramatic and traumatic experiences knows 
that feeling.

'I wanted to connect to the emotional experience and help 
others learn how to live through injustice, grow, make empowered choices
 and step into being fully responsible for their life. I am a passionate
 believer that we grow from being a victim of injustice, into surviving 
it through learning from it, and then thrive by being our best self.'

Since writing the book, Leonie has met two other women with the same
 condition and hopes to meet and help more.

She said: 'I am sure more women will relate to this as we open up the 
doors to knowledge and conversation about it.' 

Speaking about having a family of her own one day, Leonie, who is currently single but would like to find a partner to share her life with one day, added: 'Adoption is a very long and difficult process in Australia for couples let alone a single woman.

'Having just turned 50 I have had to accept that being a mother won’t be a personal experience for me. But in my work I have the privilege of helping other woman live their dream of motherhood by helping them conceive.

'I have attended births and been part of the miracle of birth for clients, friends and family. I love playing the role of pretend Aunt to my friend’s children and I have photos everywhere of every child I know. All my friends give me pictures of their babies.

'Learning to take the injustice of being denied motherhood and transform it into a productive, positive interaction with children and mothers is my way of expressing my inner mother.'
