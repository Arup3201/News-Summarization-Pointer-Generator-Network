She may have hit the big 4-0 and be known and loved for her penchant for late nights but Kate Moss proves that she doesn't need the airbrush in her latest campaign.

The suprmodel shows off her flawless skin and perfect pout in new behind the scenes imagery for her Rimmel beauty range.

Aside from her fashion designing duties with Topshop, 40-year-old Kate has been quietly creating a new beauty range for Rimmel London too.

No airbrush needed! Kate Moss, who turned 40 this year, shows off her flawless skin in the behind the scenes images from her Rimmel beauty campaign

The colourful collection of mascaras, 
lipsticks, eyeliners and nail varnish is bound to brighten up the 
nation's make-up bags this season.

Kate, who has been working with the 
beauty giant for several years, has created her first ever eye 
collection called Idol Eyes - a fitting name for the world-famous 
supermodel.

Speaking 
about the range, which includes glimmering hues of pink, green, blue and
 black mascaras, she said: 'My new Idol Eyes Collection was inspired by 
my favourite gem stones and jewels.

'The
 intense authentic shades of mascara, eye colour and liner are perfect 
for creating either a statement or more subtle eye look.'

Kate
 has also created four shadow sticks, which aim to illuminate eyes in 
one stroke, and to recreate her legendary eyeliner flick, fans can use 
her gel liner in dark emerald green.

Kate
 has added her own range to the Salon Pro nail polish collection and 
explains that she has created five Bohemian shades, which will no doubt 
perfectly complement her new Topshop range.

As
 for lips, Kate's previous collections have been some of the brand's 
best-selling and she has capitalised on this by expanding it.

'I've always loved the laid-back bohemian look because it's all about individual creativity and self-expression,' she said.

'I've worked with Rimmel to create a palette that combines rich, earthy tones with cool brights and soft nudes.

Does she ever stop? Kate Moss has unveiled a new beauty range for Rimmel London and models the colour-popping shades in the new imagery

Boho babe: Speaking about the inspiration behind her boho themed beauty line, she said: 'I've always loved the laid-back bohemian look because it's all about individual creativity and self-expression'

'Using the shades in my Urban Bohemian Collection for lips and nails, you can create a look as strong or as romantic as you like.'

Kate's new Rimmel collection, which lands on May 14, comes just days after she unveiled her new range for Topshop.

The
 model's SS14 collection is full of seventies-style pieces
 including fringed suede jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses, many of which have sold out globally.
