It is one of the most recognisable and popular of all instruments, and yet its design has remained almost unchanged for 100 years.

But now Hungarian musician Gergely Boganyi claims to have reinvented the grand piano after spending 8,000 hours and almost £1million building his own in a workshop in Budapest.

With its edgy design, finished entirely in glossy black paint, music fans have dubbed the creation the Batpiano - for its resemblance to the Batmobile.

Gergely Boganyi, 41, has spent ten years, 8,000 hours and almost £1million redesigning the grand piano in a workshop above a disused communist-era factory in Hungary

Bogyani has replaced most of the traditional wood with carbon fibre, designed two legs which act as sound deflectors to project music, and redesigned the key mechanism

Viewers of the new creation at a premiere event in Budapest earlier this month described the instrument as a Batpiano - because its angular body and black pain resemble the Batmobile

It is certainly futuristic, doing away with most of the wood traditionally used in grand pianos such as the Steinway, and replacing it with cutting-edge carbon fibre.

Almost every single one of the instrument's 18,000 components has been redesigned.

Rather than the traditional three legs, the Boganyi has only two, and both of them have been carefully shaped to help project the sound into the auditorium.

He had also reinvented the key mechanism, meaning it applies only the slightest pressure to the soundboard - the anchor of the piano to which everything else is fixed.

The board itself, instead of being made from the traditional wood, is made from more than 20 carbon composite layers woven one on top of the other.

Boganyi, 41, a feted concert pianist who has spent more than a decade building the instrument in a workshop above a disused communist-era factory, is optimistic about the results.

He said: 'What we created will enrich piano history. It is said that old pianos sound friendly, velvety, while new ones are stronger and more powerful. I was hoping for both.'

The piano traces its history back to the dulcimer, an instrument made of strings stretched across a board played with hand-held hammers, which was invented in Iran shortly after the birth of Christ.

However, the first modern piano was created by Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori in Florence, Italy, in 1709 and was called gravicembalo col piano e forte - which roughly translates as 'harpsichord with soft and loud'.

Boganyi won his first music prize at the age of six, and has gone on to play as a soloist in some of the most critically acclaimed orchestras in the world, including the London Philharmonic in 2004

Boganyi says that, unlike other modern redesigns such as though sponsored by Peugeot and Audi, his was focused entirely on the sound, rather than the appearance 

Following a premiere concert in Budapest on Wednesday this week, the piano will go on sale later this year. Boganyi does not know how much it will cost yet, but says 'it will be expensive'

It was designed to improve upon the harpsichord, the favoured instrument of Bach and Handel, which produced notes by plucking at strings, rather than striking them.

The plucking action meant that the harpsichord was only capable of producing one flat tone, while the piano's hammer action meant the tone varied depending on how hard the key was struck.

During the late 18th century, around the time Beethoven was playing, craftsmen added more keys to the instrument, as well as the first pedals to dampen or sustain notes.

The suit the new styles of playing, the hammers were made heavier, and the strings stronger, producing a powerful new sound. 

Makers also experimented with upright versions, with the strings stretched vertically in front of the player, and square grand pianos.

The last great period of invention came in the mid to late 1800s, when Steinway & Sons developed their grand piano, and added a third pedal underneath.

But now Boganyi, who won his first music prize aged six and performs as a soloist in acclaimed orchestras such as the London Philharmonic, is hoping to add to that history with his latest version.

He says the new instrument is based on innovations dreamed up, but not widely used, by 19th-century Hungarian piano makers.

The instrument's soundboard, the central fitting to which all other parts are fixed, has been refashioned out of 20 layers of carbon composite woven together giving the piano a lighter, airier sound

Jazz pianist Gerald Clayton described playing the new piano as like being 'in a spaceship, like you are hovering above gravity (pictured, Boganyi plays the piano in his workshop)

And it seems that it could have been worth the wait as expert piano players agreed that the sound it produces is entirely new.

Karoly Reisinger, CEO of New York piano repair shop Klavierhaus, was 'mesmerized at the sound he said brought lyrical qualities back to the piano after a century of power-focused development.

He said: 'In this design you will be able to hear the 1850-1860 era qualities, lyrical, bell-like, precise – and also the modern instrument that our time is used to, which is clarity.'

Four-time Grammy-nominated jazz pianist Gerald Clayton said he felt he had played a slick new type of instrument.

He added: 'The sound almost feels as if you're in a bubble, it's so clear. It feels like you are in a spaceship, like you are hovering above gravity.

'When you play a lot of notes, or you play a chord, the sensation is different. It's super-clear.' 

Following a premiere in the Grand Concert Hall in Budapest earlier this month, the piano will go on sale later this year.

Boganyi does not know how much each one will cost yet, but he says 'with these materials it will not be cheap.'
