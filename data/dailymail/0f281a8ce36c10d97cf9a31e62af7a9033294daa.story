Labour has been accused of a ‘shameful’ attempt to scare parents into thinking their young children will not get a place at school in September.

Furious Education Secretary Nicky Morgan told MailOnline parents deserved better than ‘scare stories’ peddled by Labour politicians putting their own interests before those of the country’s children.

It comes after Labour’s Tristram Hunt claimed there was a ‘crippling’ shortage of places, despite the government committing £7billion for increasing school sizes over the next six years.

Parents had until last Thursday to apply for children to start primary school in the autumn, naming at least three schools where they want to send their child.

Mr Hunt used the deadline to launch an attack on the government in an article for MailOnline, claiming many families will be left disappointed, with pupils forced to travel further or squeeze into over-crowded classrooms.

He highlighted figures suggesting 18 per cent of schools said they did not have enough capacity for their pupils.

‘This year's primary school admissions process is complicated by a crippling shortage in places that will leave many parents disappointed,’ he claimed.

It came after the Local Government Association warned schools could be pushed to breaking point over the next decade, with almost a million more places for pupils needed.

Official figures show that by 2023 there will be a total of 4.7million primary age pupils, up from 4.3million in 2014

But Mrs Morgan condemned both Mr Hunt and the LGA for using ‘the anxieties of parents’ to score political points.

In an article for MailOnline, she said: ‘Robust debate in politics is fine. It’s what we politicians expect.

‘But I believe a healthy debate should be based on facts rather than scaremongering or special pleading.

‘At a time when parents and children should be looking forward with excitement to taking their first steps in education, they deserve better than to be exposed to scare stories peddled by those who seek to put their own interests before those of our nation’s children.’

She said it was ‘shameful’ that Mr Hunt had the ‘cheek’ to criticse the coalition, after Labour’s poor record on school places.

Mr Hunt had ignored the fact that Labour cut funding for school places and took 200,000 primary school places out of the system.

She added that Labour did this ‘in the middle of a baby boom and at the same time as letting immigration get out of control’.

She said the government had already put an extra £5billion in providing ‘good school places’ in this Parliament, with a further £7billion for new places over the next six years.

And she insisted the Tories would focus on improving the quality of schools, adding that under Labour a third of children left primary school ‘unable to read, write or add up properly and Britain stagnated in international school league tables while the rest of the world moved on’.

Official figures predict that there may be around 900,000 extra pupils in England's schools over the next decade.

This is always a difficult and anxious time of year for those parents with children starting school in September. 

With the passing of the application deadline, some fear they may not be granted the place they desperately want, while others are left wondering if they’ve made the right choice at all.

I’ve been there. I know what it’s like. And that’s why I think it’s such a shame that some have chosen to use 

to play on and exacerbate those concerns simply to push their own political agendas.

In the past week the Local Government Association – an organisation that according to its own website exists to ‘promote’ the interests of local councils – claimed that without a dramatic increase in funding for local authorities the country faces a ‘crisis’ in school places.

The LGA, of course, ignored the fact that this government changed the system so that it picks up almost all of the bill for providing school places on behalf of councils who have the legal duty to do so. 

We have already put an extra £5 billion into providing good school places in this parliament and more has been allocated for the years to come.

Of course, it is the LGA’s job to lobby on behalf of its members. I understand that. But it is a shame to use the anxieties of parents as peg on which to do so.

It is more shameful still when done by elected politicians in positions of responsibility, like the Labour Party’s education spokesman.

Ignoring the fact that his government slashed funding for school places; overlooking the uncomfortable truth that the last Labour government took 200,000 primary school places out of the system; and neglecting to mention that they did this in the middle of a baby boom and at the same time as letting immigration get out of control, Tristram Hunt had the cheek last week to criticise this government for failing to do enough.

I think some facts might be in order.

Firstly, one of the first decisions this government took was to double the funding allocated to creating new school places. 

As a result, local authorities have been able to more than make up for Labour’s cuts by creating 260,000 new places since 2010. 

We have also funded more than 250 new free schools that are providing essential and high-quality school places in communities across the country. 

70 per cent of these have been established in areas where there is an essential need for extra capacity, and a third have been targeted to provide good school places in some of the most deprived areas of the country.

The government has also allocated a further £7 billion for new school places over the next six years as part of our sensible, planned approach that has replaced the chaos of the Labour years.

90 per cent of the new places required for September of this year are already in place or underway. How do we know? 

Because this government introduced a basic need monitoring process that allows us to plan effectively. 

The coalition has funded more than 250 new free schools that are providing 'essential and high-quality school places in communities across the country',  Mrs Morgan added

As a result, parents can be confident that there will be a school place available for their child when they need it. Under the last Labour government, no such monitoring took place.

But that is not the limit of our ambitions. While guaranteeing every child the school place they need is vital, it’s also important to focus on quality. 

I want every child to have the chance to go to a good or outstanding local school where standards are high and discipline in strong.

Fortunately, as a result of our plan for education, a million more children are learning in good or outstanding schools today than when we came to office. In fact, we now have more children in good or outstanding schools than ever before.

Contrast that with the record of the last Labour government. Under them, a third of children left primary school unable to read, write or add up properly and Britain stagnated in international school league tables while the rest of the world moved on.

All of this progress has only been possible because this government took the difficult decisions necessary to get the economy back on track. 

It’s because of this that we have been able to protect the schools budget in this parliament, spend an extra £5 billion on school places, and invest £18 billion to improve school buildings across the country - more than double the amount Labour spent in its first two terms combined.

That’s what our long-term economic plan means for education, and we must stick to the course. Labour’s chaotic plans would mean more borrowing and more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever pay off. 

They have already announced £1.8 billion of spending commitments in education alone, yet have consistently refused to answer questions about how they would pay for them.

Robust debate in politics is fine. It’s what we politicians expect. But I believe a healthy debate should be based on facts rather than scaremongering or special pleading.

At a time when parents and children should be looking forward with excitement to taking their first steps in education, they deserve better than to be exposed to scare stories peddled by those who seek to put their own interests before those of our nation’s children.
