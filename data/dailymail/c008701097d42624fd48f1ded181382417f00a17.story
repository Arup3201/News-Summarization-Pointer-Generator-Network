A gypsy homeowner who was refused permission to build a caravan site in his back garden is attempting to bypass planning laws by having it declared as an official campsite. 

Bill Watton, 45, wanted to put three caravans containing two gypsy households on green belt land at the back of his detached home in Essington, near Wolverhampton. 

After more than 70 angry residents complained at a public meeting the plans were thrown out by South Staffordshire District Council on August 13 last year.

However, the row has now taken a bizarre turn with Mr Watton submitting plans to have the two acres of land declared a campsite with the Camping and Caravan Club.

The site - which is in a residential area of the Staffordshire village - will also take up to five caravans or motor-homes along with 10 tents.

But yesterday furious residents accused Mr Watton of 'trying it on' saying that nobody would ever visit Wolverhampton for a camping holiday anyway. 

Councillor David Clifft, chairman of Essington Parish Council, said: 'Mr Watton has failed in his efforts to get planning from the council so this is his way of getting around that.

'It is important people in the area know what is going on so they can take the opportunity to put their view across.

'It is also highly unlikely the Camping and Caravan club are aware of the history of the site so I will be sending them a full copy of the planning committee’s last report.'

Councillor Clifft said a petition opposing the plan has been signed by 135 residents and 16 letters of objection had also been received. 

Villagers had objected to the caravans being situated on green belt land and said they were also concerned about increased traffic.

Long Lane resident Caroline Adams, 48, said: 'If they want to live as a traveller they shouldn’t be living in the back garden in a residential lane. 

'If this is agreed and it went ahead it would set a precedent. 

'Rather than stay in a nursing home people will say they may as well stay in a back garden.'

Lorraine Johnston, 56, whose house backs onto Mr Watton’s property said: 'Nobody wants the loss of green belt land. 

'We are concerned about the impact on the environment and about the loss of views.'

Local hairdresser Joyce Parry, 44, added: 'It’s just a ploy to get around the councils decision, there is now way there is any other reason for it.

'Who on earth is going to come to Wolverhampton for a camping holiday? He is just trying it on.'

Darren Whittington, membership services director at the Camping and Caravan Club, said: 'When a certified site is applied for, the club always consults with local residents and authorities as to whether the location should receive a certificate from us and we will continue to follow this process in this instance.'

Residents have been given 28 days to comment on the application prior to the Camping and Caravan Club making their decision. 

Mr Watton was unavailable for comment today.
