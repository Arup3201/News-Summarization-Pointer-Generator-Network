England ladies striker Toni Duggan has been forced to apologise after blacking up for a fancy dress party.

A picture of the 22-year-old as Whoopi Goldberg's character from the popular 1992 film Sister Act appeared on Instagram but has since been removed.

Duggan's choice seemed ill-thought out, given the Manchester City player is also a leading ambassador for the Kick It Out campaign which aims to stop racism in football.

The player often speaks at schools and colleges about the campaign.

Manchester City players Steph Houghton, 25, and Jill Scott, 27, also appear in the photograph dressed as characters from Disney's 101 Dalmatians. 

However, within hours of the photograph being posted online people took to Twitter to criticise the footballer's decision to black her face up.

One person tweeted: 'There aren't enough white people to dress up as?'

The shamed footballer later told The Mirror: 'I am very sorry for my actions and for any offence I may have caused.

'I would like to apologise wholeheartedly to England, my club and anyone else that I may have offended.

'I am proud to be a Next 20 ambassador for Kick It Out and take this role very seriously for an organisation that does such good work.'

A spokesperson for England's women's 
side said it was aware of the photographs and that the matter was being 
dealt with internally. 

A 
key player for the England youth teams in recent years, Duggan made her 
senior team debut in the European Championship qualifier against Croatia
 in September 2012.

She started on Wednesday in Cyprus against Italy.

Kick It Out, however, is understood 
to believe the incident has been blown out of proportion and is 
retaining Duggan as an ambassador.

Duggan, 22, said in a statement: 'I am very sorry for my actions and for any offence I may have caused.

'I would like to apologise wholeheartedly to England, my club and anyone else that I may have offended.

'I
 am proud to be a 'Next 20' ambassador for Kick It Out and take this 
role very seriously for an organisation that does such good work.'
