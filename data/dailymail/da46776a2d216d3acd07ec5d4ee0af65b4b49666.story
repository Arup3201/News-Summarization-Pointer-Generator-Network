A business analyst who quit a high-flying job in London to become landlord of a country inn has seen his freehouse named pub of the year.

Peter Tiley quit the rat race in 2013 and spent nearly all his savings on leasing The Salutation Inn in Ham near Berkeley, Gloucestershire, after realising his 'passion' was 'spending time in a wonderful old boozer talking rubbish with friends.'

The 31-year-old had had heard a talk from Steve Jobs on being passionate about work which got him thinking 'about how I would look back on my life as an old man'.

After quitting his high flying job in London Peter Tiley opened a pub in Gloucestershire with his wife Claire which has just been named Pub of The Year 

So Mr Tiley quit his job at the telecoms consultancy in Soho and moved with his now-wife Claire to the heart of rural Gloucestershire - despite never having pulled a pint in his life.

But Mr Tiley's passion has clearly paid off, with the freehouse now awarded the prize of Pub of The Year - just two years after the couple took it over.

He told the Independent: 'I started thinking about how I would look back on my life as an old man.

'You have to be passionate, but if you are really, really passionate about something, the chances are you will be good at it. I am doing 90-hour weeks, but it doesn't feel like work.'

At the time of switching careers, the only experience Mr Tiley had had with the beer world was brewing his own in the bath at his home in Herne Hill, south London. 

Despite this, Mr Tiley ploughed all his savings into buying the pub and, within a year, the pub had won its local Camra branch competition.

It then took the regional title before beating thousands of pubs across the country.

The pub was given the accolade by the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), which described it as a 'gem'. 

Mr Tiley opened the pub in 2013 and just two years later it is known as one of the country's best

The pub specialises in cider and beer both of which Mr Tiley is especially passionate about

The interior of The Salulation Inn or The Sally as it is known to locals has a cosy feel 

Mr Tileyr grew up in Gloucestershire but left to work as a telecoms business consultant in London.

He regularly visited pubs in the capital and quickly realised what made some more welcoming and successful than others.

A speech by Apple boss Steve Jobs about being passionate about work made him realise that he wanted to work in the drinks industry, and he devised  an original plan to run a micro brewery.

But when his father told him the Salutation Inn was for sale so he took the plunge - and now he's working on plans to brew his own beer.

Mr Tiley says that he learnt good bar practice visiting his own locals in the city.

He said: 'When I went to pubs in London I figured out that little things like a warm welcome, saying hello, goodbye or, better still, knowing your name, meant a lot so I have put that into practice here.

'I had a good job in London, but I felt I needed to do something I really cared about.'

Built in 1840, The Salutation, know locally as the Sally, has two cosy bars, a log fire and skittle alley, while Camra's judges were overwhelmed by the welcome drinkers receive, one saying: 'It's like being invited into a private house.'

Mr Tiley was determined to continue local traditions such as Morris dancing and apple wassailing on offer, while regulars can try their luck playing barman in special Locals Behind The Bar nights.

Regulars often crowd round the wooden piano in the bar for singalong sessions, enjoy Morris dancing and go wassailing to ensure a good cider year.

There are live folk music events, guest chef nights - one each month, the only time dinner is served - and meet the brewer evenings so locals can see the face behind their pint.

'We have a lot going on and it is always busy here,' Mr Tiley said. 'I’m not sure what makes it so special, it has something about it that you can’t put a name to.

'On a Friday night all the regulars are crammed in and you can barely move but it is just the most brilliant place.'

Meanwhile, Mr Tiley raised 11 pigs in a walled garden last year and now serves their meat on the menu.

The pigs are fed apples from local growers, as well as pulp leftover from cider making, which gives the meat an 'incredible' flavour, Mr Tiley said.

He explained: 'This isn't a pub for vegetarians but we're in rural Gloucestershire, this is traditional farming country.'

Mr Tiley added that he had to give thanks to not only his staff but his customers for making the pub what it is today.

'We count ourselves unbelievably lucky to have a brilliant team of staff who are so passionate and dedicated, as well as a community of locals who have given so much to support and contribute towards the pub.

'They have been brilliant from the moment we arrived. They’ve painted the skittles hall, done the gardening, built picnic benches. We feel so lucky.

'I was terrified on my first night, I thought everyone was thinking, ‘who is this young guy behind the bar, what does he know about running a pub?’.

'I truly believe that every village should have a pub, they are so vital for the local community and I would be absolutely devastated to mess this one up. We had to get it right. It’s been hard, really hard, but it is worth it.'  

Mr Tiley offers few soft drinks and no coffee or tea as he says this is a pub where people come to drink real ale

Mr Tiley says that having been awarded such a prestigious title was a dream come true for him.

'For the Sally to have won National Pub of the Year is beyond our wildest dreams - we're totally shell-shocked. 

'Pubs are so important to me that to have our own one recognised in this way is just amazing.

'It is these people that have made the pub what it is today and for that we are incredibly grateful.' 

Camra director Abigail Newton said that they had been incredibly impressed with what the husband and wife had managed to achieve since opening. 

'What Peter and Claire have done in the short time they have been running the pub is nothing short of staggering and goes to show that passion, enthusiasm, and a real love of beer are hugely important when running a pub.

'They have hit the ground running and taken what was already a great pub and made it truly exceptional - beating off over 50,000 other landlords from across the UK.'  

Pubs are judged on atmosphere, level of service, value for money and community focus, with extra weighting for the quality of their real ale, cider and perry.

The winning pub is described in Camra's Good Beer Guide 2015 as a 'rural gem in the Severn Valley, within walking distance of the Jenner Museum, Berkeley Castle `and Deer Park. 

'The enthusiastic landlord keeps an inspired selection of ales and eight real ciders and perries.'

The three other finalists were The Freshfield in Formby (Merseyside), The Harewood Arms in Broadbottom (Greater Manchester) and The Windmill in Sevenoaks Weald (Kent).
