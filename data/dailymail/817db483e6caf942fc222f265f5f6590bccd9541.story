Just over a month ago, Alan Pardew sat down with Newcastle’s inner circle to discuss the club’s targets for the January transfer window. It was a short meeting.

Mike Ashley was content, delighted with his club’s climb up the table after their failure to register a victory in the Barclays Premier League until they beat Leicester on October 18.

But Pardew, who was named LMA manager of the year in 2012 after guiding Newcastle to fifth and the Europa League, is an ambitious man.

He wanted to add quality to the team, attracting players with pedigree to St James’ Park in order to have a genuine crack at getting back into the top four. Ashley was having none of it.

As Pardew prepares to start work at Crystal Palace, his biggest beef with his former employers at Newcastle is that he did not get to choose the players. Instead they are scouted by Graham Carr and deposited at their Darsley Park training ground for Pardew to use as he sees fit.

Last summer, for example, a young Argentinian striker by the name of Facundo Ferreyra arrived on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk for the season. Ferreyra, 23, has yet to play and on Monday one source at the club described him as one of the worst players ever seen at this level.

Two more signings, Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles, arrived in the summer and were immediately sent on loan to Nottingham Forest before Pardew could even assess them.

As the transfer window approaches, Pardew fears Moussa Sissoko, one of the club’s best players, will be picked off by Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain. Last year, after influential midfielder Yohan Cabaye was sold to PSG for £19m on January 29, they lost 11 of their last 14 games in the Premier League. He was wary of a repeat should Sissoko be sold.

Newcastle’s manager wants a real input into the teams he sends out in front of some of the most demanding supporters in the country, many of whom have never accepted him.

His appointment reportedly received the backing of only five per cent of fans in a poll at the time, while the SackPardew.com and P45Due campaigns hurt him more than he will ever let on. Now is the time to make a clean break.

On Monday the manager was at his family home in Surrey, waiting for Ashley to respond from his holiday home in Barbados before he could return home for good.

Despite the tensions at St James’ Park, particularly over transfer strategy, Pardew has an excellent relationship with Ashley.

He appreciated the owner’s support during their bleak start to the season and was taken by surprise when Ashley made an impromptu visit to the dressing room after that win against Leicester.

Now that he has found a way out of the complex eight-year Newcastle contract he signed in September 2012, Pardew will have the backing of Palace’s four owners.

Although Steve Parish, Stephen Browett, Martin Long and Jeremy Hosking are equal shareholders, Parish is the most prominent. Undoubtedly, though, the appointment of Pardew will meet with the approval of all four. To them it will feel as though he is coming home.

Pardew served Palace with distinction in the Eighties and very early Nineties, scoring the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in April 1990.

There is an emotional pull for Pardew, who came through a difficult start to his career at Selhurst Park.

Mark Bright, now the club’s official ambassador and a sounding board for Parish, knows Pardew well from his own playing days at Palace and will make sure he settles quickly.

Setting aside the size of Newcastle United and the 52,000 supporters who watch the team each week at St James’ Park, Pardew and Palace appear to be a good fit. 

Since the Eagles takeover in 2010, Pardew has been on friendly terms with Parish and he is a regular guest in the boardroom when he watches games at Selhurst Park. Parish has been tempted to appoint him on several occasions and he was under consideration again before plumping for Neil Warnock in August.

After Warnock was sacked following the 3-1 defeat against Southampton on Boxing Day, the deal for Pardew began to fall into place. Since then, Ashley has been negotiating Pardew’s release from his sun lounger in the Caribbean.

Ashley is wary of the upheaval, the inevitable change in atmosphere at a club after a manager leaves on his own terms instead of the owner’s. It is an unusual situation.

Pardew, who has spent four years at Newcastle, leaves a team ninth in the Premier League table for one fighting against relegation with 19 games left of the season.

His brief is to keep the team in the division, to build on the brilliant work of Tony Pulis.

But now that he is back in south London, the signings must be all down to him.
