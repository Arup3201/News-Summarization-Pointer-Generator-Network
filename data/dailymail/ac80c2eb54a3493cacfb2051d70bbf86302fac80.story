Ed Miliband is on course to win a commanding majority at the next Election, according to a bombshell poll by Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft.

The survey of 213 marginal constituencies found the Tories would lose 93 seats to Labour, giving Mr Miliband a majority of 84 if a General Election was held tomorrow.

The Tory peer warned party members hoping to triumph in 2015 that they faced a challenge equivalent to military strategists ‘planning the final assault on Berlin while evacuating Dunkirk’.

The findings are also crushing for the Lib Dems, who would stand to lose 30 of their 46 MPs in England and Wales.

It comes after a separate poll found just 7 per cent of Tory members expect to win in 2015.

Lord Ashcroft said recently he had stopped bank-rolling the party, privately citing doubts about the party’s chances in 2015.
