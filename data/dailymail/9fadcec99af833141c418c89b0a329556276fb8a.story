Once it plied the waters of Europe, carrying coal from port to port.These days, Vega IV’s cargo is rather different.

It includes a home cinema system, 
state of the art kitchen and walk-in dressing room – not to mention a 
fully stocked cocktail bar.

The 130ft Dutch barge, built in 1959, has been transformed into a ‘floating penthouse’ moored on the Thames. And if you happen to have £1.65million idling in the bank, it could be yours.

Luxury liner: Gone is the barge that lugged coal from port to port. Now, 64 years on, Vega IV has been re-purposed as an opulent 'floating penthouse'

High living: The barge is on the market for £1.65million. It offers a luxury lifestyle but is cheaper than similar properties on land. Most London houseboats cost less than £100,000

Shaken, not stirred: When the river is calm, owners can entertain in their state of the art cocktail bar. The barge is expected to be use as an entertainment venue rather than a home

Its
 other luxurious features include under-floor heating, a 40in HD 
flatscreen television, a rainfall shower and a hanging fireplace.

If that wasn’t enough, the lucky 
owner will have their own butler on call 24 hours a day, with room 
service offered by the nearby five-star Hotel Rafayel.

As you might expect, the property is being marketed towards the capital’s wealthiest businessmen and celebrities.

Floating house, floating fireplace: The unique hanging fireplace in the corner of the living room is just one of the barge's novelty features. It's quirky extras, including an on-call butler, have peaked the interest of singer Bryan Adams and explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes

Small print: There is no stamp duty or mooring charges on the barge, which is moored in Battersea, South London. Owners will have to pay a £3,000 charge every year to Port of London Authority and and annual service charge of £7,500

No expense spared: The barge has been imported from Holland, Belgium and France and takes between seven and ten months to fill out. The boat has three double bedrooms and an outdoor terrace

Singer Bryan Adams and explorer Sir 
Ranulph Fiennes are among those said to have made enquiries. The vessel 
is moored at Oyster Pier, a new development in Battersea, South London.

Vega IV is the first boat to have been refitted so far, and there is space at the harbour for nine more vessels.

Prospective buyers can have their craft tailored and designed to their own specifications.

Developers say they expect the boats 
to be used mostly as entertaining spaces rather than homes. Owners will 
be able to use the hotel’s gym and beauty salon and will even be granted
 the use of a neighbouring heli-pad. 

The first boat has three double bedrooms and 2,300sq ft of internal space, with its own outdoor terrace.

It also comes with a working engine, 
which can reach a top speed of 10mph. The barges themselves, which are 
being sold through London estate agent Bective Leslie Marsh, are 
imported from Holland, Belgium and France, and take between seven and 
ten months to fit out.

There is no stamp duty or mooring 
charges, although owners will have to pay a £3,000 Port of London 
Authority charge each year, plus an annual service charge of £7,500.

Chris Atherton, manager at Oyster 
Pier, said: ‘The challenge was to design houseboats to appeal to the 
prime central London market. 

‘The boats are the floating 
equivalent of luxury penthouses, but they cost a fraction of the price 
of what a similar type of property on land would cost.

Room with a view: The owner can watch the world go by from their spot on the Thames. Prospective buyers can have their craft designed and tailored to their liking

Prototype: The 2,300sq ft barge comes with an on-call butler, with room service offered by the nearby five-star Hotel Rafayel. This is the first of nine models moored in Oyster Pier

There is almost no limit to what people can create. Whatever they want in their boat, we can try and make it happen. 

‘There has been a lot of interest, 
not just from people who wan  to use them as homes to live in, but 
from people who simply use them as spaces to entertain their guests.’

Most houseboats and barges in London cost less than £100,000.
