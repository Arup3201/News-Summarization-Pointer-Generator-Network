David Cameron's former 'back to work tsar' Emma Harrison founded the company A4e

Ten workers at a controversial company used by the Government to get people off benefits forged signatures in a £300,000 fake jobs fraud, a court heard today.

The group were employed by the  firm A4e which was paid millions of pounds to help people from difficult backgrounds get a job.

The company was founded by David Cameron's former 'back to work Tsar' Emma Harrison, who was forced to step down from her role after fraud allegations first came to light in 2012.

During a 13-week trial at Reading Crown Court it emerged that 10 staff at the company falsely claimed they had helped people find jobs to hit bonus targets.

Some even falsified files using the names of family members, while others offered bribes in the form of vouchers to get people to fill out false forms.

Four defendants were convicted in connection with the fraud after six of their colleagues had previously pleaded guilty.

Ines Cano-Uribe, 39, of Madrid, Spain, was found guilty of two counts of forgery, while Zabar Khalil, 35, Matthew Hannigan-Train, 31 and Hayley Wilson, 27, were each found guilty of one count of forgery.

Summing up for the prosecution, Sarah Wood said that between them they had created 167 false claims, a fraud which cost the Department for Work and Pensions - which contracted A4e to carry out the work - around £300,000.

The court heard that A4e ran the Aspire to Inspire lone parent mentoring programme between 2008 and 2011.

The contract covered Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire and was funded by the European Social Fund.

A4e was paid £1.3million for the contract and £10,500 a month to implement it. The company received payments for each person it helped gain employment.

The court heard that while A4e helped 558 people find jobs, staff lied about others.

Ms Wood said: 'The total amount of fraudulent claiming was 167 files, for a total loss of £288,595.'

During the period one of the workers falsified a 'successful job' in her nephew's name and another supposedly for her husband.

Another worker bribed a man with £150 of vouchers to sign forms saying he had been through A4e training.

Ten workers at the firm A4e - which was employed by the Government to get people off benefits - are being sentenced for ripping off taxpayers in a £300,000 fraud

The crimes came to light when an employee at A4e blew the whistle on the scam.

A4e was founded in 1991 by Emma Harrison, who was later appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron as the Government's 'families champion', an advisory role on troubled homes.

The firm signed the £1.3 million, three-year Inspire to Aspire contract in August 2008.

The sentencing, before Judge Angela Morris, at Reading Crown Court, continues.
