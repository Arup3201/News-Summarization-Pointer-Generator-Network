Israel has agreed to swap 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for a lone soldier captured by Gaza’s Islamist rulers five years ago.

The deal to release Gilad Shalit resolves one of the most emotive issues in the Middle-East.

Shalit, then 19, was captured by militants who tunnelled their way out of Gaza and forced him back over the border in 2006.

Cause celebre: Shalit was 19 when he was captured by militants who tunnelled their way out of Gaza and into Israel before forcing him back over the border in 2006

Israel's government approved the deal following a three-hour debate after which both Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal announced the agreement in televised comments.

Mr Netanyahu said Schalit would return home within days. Mr Mashaal, portraying the agreement as a victory, said the Palestinian prisoners would be freed in two stages over two months.

Mr Netanyahu added: 'There is built-in tension between the desire to return a kidnapped soldier... and the need to preserve the security of the citizens of Israel.

'I believe we reached the best deal that we can reach at this time, a stormy time in the Middle-East.'

A source involved in the talks said the discussions had been mediated by Egypt.

The pact is virtually certain to improve the climate for restarting peace talks that have been stalled for over a year.

But
 it gives Hamas, the militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, a victory
 that might strengthen its hand against the more moderate Palestinian 
president Mahmoud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority runs the West Bank.

Mr
 Mashaal said 1,000 men and 27 women prisoners would be released, the 
first 450 over the next week and the rest within two months. He said 
they would include 315 prisoners serving life sentences, suggesting they
 were convicted of attacks that caused the deaths of Israelis.

Seeming to confirm Israel's fears, Mr Mashaal said that those who are released 'will return to ... the national struggle'.

'This is a national achievement for the whole Palestinian people,' he said.

In
 the northern Gaza town of Jebaliya, thousands of Hamas supporters 
flocked the streets, led by masked militants. Thousands of other Gazans 
rushed to their border with Egypt, clutching Palestinian and Egyptian 
flags, tossing flowers and cheering.

The exchange is sure to be greeted with relief by both sides.

A
 campaign by Shalit’s family has made him a cause celebre in Israel 
and his release a test for Mr Netanyahu’s government. The Palestinians 
have long clamoured for the release of hundreds they consider political 
prisoners.

Israeli 
television quoted Mr Netanyahu as telling Shalit’s parents that ever
 since he took office three years ago 'I’ve been waiting for the chance 
to make this telephone call' to inform them of the deal.

The
 wife of Marwan Barghouti, a charismatic activist seen as a future 
Palestinian leader, told Reuters in the West Bank that she was eagerly 
awaiting word that he will be included in the prisoner swap.

In Gaza, the families of men jailed for life by Israel awaited word that their names would be on the list.

The
 main sticking point in earlier negotiations had been Israel’s 
reluctance to meet Hamas’ demands to free prisoners convicted of 
involvement in lethal attacks against Israelis.

Israel
 has carried out several lopsided prisoner swaps in the past, notably in
 1985 when hundreds of Palestinian prisoners were freed in exchange for 
several soldiers captured by a guerilla group in Lebanon.

The
 ordeal of Shalit, a fresh-faced corporal, transfixed Israel after 
the tank gunner was captured by militants who tunnelled their way out of
 Gaza and then forced him back over the border.

He was 19 at the time and had begun his mandatory three-year army service nearly a year previously.

For Hamas, the deal is a victory that might strengthen its hand against the more moderate Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority runs the West Bank

Defiant gesture: Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal

Shalit, a native Israeli who also holds French citizenship, was last 
seen in a videotape released by his captors in September 2009 showing 
him looking pale and thin.

He received no visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross, despite many appeals.

Britain welcomed a deal to secure Shalit's release.

Foreign
 Secretary William Hague said he hoped the prisoner swap agreement 
between Tel Aviv and Hamas officials would help 'build confidence and 
trust'.

Shalit was 
captured in a cross-border raid by Palestinian militants in June 2006, 
and dragged into Gaza. Little has been known about his fate since then.

But
 Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu announced in a televised 
address last night that the deadlock on the issue had been broken.

The soldier will reportedly be released in exchange for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.

Egyptian and German diplomats are believed to have played a significant role in the negotiations.

Mr
 Hague said: 'I welcome the agreement between Israel and Hamas to 
release Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, next month as part of a prisoner 
exchange.

'Holding him in captivity has been utterly unjustified from the beginning and yet it has gone on for five long years.

'We have always called for his unconditional release. We are pleased that this long overdue development is finally taking place.

'Mr Shalit’s long captivity has been painful for his family and I hope that he will be reunited with them as soon as possible.

'The UK supports all such efforts to build confidence and trust between all parties.'
