More than 4,000 officers will be on duty during Baroness Thatcher's funeral tomorrow in an attempt to guard against violent demonstrations.

Shops that line the route of the procession have been warned to hide anything which could be used as a weapon by protesters.

Businesses have also been asked to deploy private security and block off entrances to building in an attempt to crack down on the possibility of violent demonstrations.

Police
 have been urged to act against plans to insult Lady Thatcher's funeral 
after hundreds of protesters pledged to turn their backs on the coffin 
of the former Prime Minister as it travels through Central London.

Another
 unorthodox protest expected to take place tomorrow is throwing milk on 
the road in an ironic gesture aimed at the woman once known as the 'milk
 snatcher'.

The
 funeral procession will go from the Palace of Westminster to St Paul's 
Cathedral ahead of the funeral ceremony which starts at 11am.

It
 will be globally televised to an audience of millions, and is expected 
to attract widespread protests from left-wingers opposing the legacy of 
the divisive leader.

'We have been approached by a small number of people planning to protest,' Commander Christine Jones said today. 'We are working with them, and would ask anyone who plans to protest to come forward and speak with us today.'

There
 are also fears it could be targeted by terrorists, particularly in the 
wake of the bomb blasts which killed three people at yesterday's Boston 
Marathon, although a Metropolitan Police spokesman said today that the 
force had not altered its security plans.

City
 of London Police have told businesses along the route to remove 
'dustbins, ladders or loose tools and equipment, which could be used to 
gain access or used as weapons'.

Shops
 and offices were further warned to make sure security officers have a 
'visible presence' and that their buildings do not have too many 
accessible entry points.

In a letter to local businesses, 
officers advised them to make sure their CCTV systems were operating and
 stock up on emergency and first aid supplies.

They also asked shopkeepers to report
 'suspicious behaviour', such as people wearing unusually bulky clothing
 or asking detailed questions about security arrangements.

HSBC's branch on Fleet Street, near 
the cathedral, is to close between 10am and 11am as banks have 
previously been the focus of protests at similar events.

Paternoster Square, home of the 
London Stock Exchange which was targeted by Occupy protesters in 2011, 
is putting advanced security measures in place for the event.

One of the more unusual protests 
which has been discussed on Twitter could involve flooding the London 
streets with milk, or demonstrators throwing milk at the funeral 
procession.

Lady Thatcher became notorious as 
'Margaret Thatcher, milk snatcher' when she abolished free milk for most
 schoolchildren while she was Education Secretary under Ted Heath.

One Twitter user wrote: 'I think the 
best protest against the Thatcher funeral would be to go the day before 
and pour milk on to the route.'

Police were under pressure last night
 to crack down on plans by protesters to turn their backs on the coffin 
in a gesture of disrespect.

Campaigners said Scotland Yard has 
effectively encouraged the move by decreeing it is not against the law 
and will not provoke arrests.

The
 move is calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to her grieving 
family without provoking action by police. It will be seen by millions 
of people worldwide as the huge ceremonial occasion is beamed live 
around the world on TV.

Police
 chiefs said they are ‘not there to uphold respect’ and said 
demonstrators who are merely ‘insulting’ are unlikely to face arrest.

But they faced a backlash from many who questioned why anyone would want to be so disrespectful to the dead stateswoman.

Hundreds of people have signed up to online sites vowing to wear red and turn their back on the military funeral cortege.

They want to occupy high-profile points of Lady Thatcher’s three mile funeral procession so their views will not be missed.

Organiser
 Rebecca Lush Blum, 41, of Warsash, Hampshire, said that by giving the 
green light police have encouraged others to join in.

The
 environmental campaigner said: ‘It is symbolic gesture that I turn my 
back on Thatcherism and all it stood for and I hope other people will 
join me.’

John Cooper, QC, 
the architect behind the back-turning protest, said the public nature of
 the funeral means it is impossible to ban insulting gestures.

He
 said: ‘Simply saying it is beastly, horrible or distasteful - a point 
of view that I can understand - does not take away the fact there will 
be a proportion of society that rightly wants to legally demonstrate.

‘Therefore
 what I am doing is trying to provide an outlet for people who so chose 
who want to demonstrate. I’m not saying they should or they shouldn’t, 
but for those that choose to there should be a legal way.

‘It might well be cathartic or 
therapeutic for some to do so and one legal way, and the police have 
agreed it is legal, is to turn your backs on the cortege.’

Scotland Yard refused to say how many groups have asked for permission to demonstrate during the funeral.

But several Facebook protest groups that sprung up since Lady Thatcher died have attracted a vocal and enthusiastic following.

One group, Maggie’s Good Riddance Party, threatens to hold a ‘right jolly knees-up’ outside St Paul’s Cathedral.

Index on Censorship defended the right to protest during the funeral, arguing that police were obliged to protect peaceful demonstrations.

'Some may feel it is distasteful to protest at a funeral but the right to protest is fundamental to a democracy,' chief executive Kirsty Hughes said. 'The role of the police is to maintain order not to prevent legitimate protest by those who wish to show dissent.'

Retired
 chief constable Dr Tim Brain said police are forced to tread the fine 
line between the right to protest and upholding the law.

The
 retired Gloucestershire chief said shouting insults may even be 
tolerated as behaviour that is ‘insulting but not alarming or 
distressing’ may be allowed.

He said police will have the ‘human rights’ of protesters to ‘freedom of expression’ at the front of their minds.

Asked if shouting would be an offence, he replied: ‘It depends what is being shouted. That is the very fine judgment you have to make about policing in a democracy.’

Speaking on BBC Radio 4, he said police will be ‘very firm’ if protest becomes disruption, for example if objects are thrown at the procession.

Dr Brain said: ‘My expectation will be that when you move from peaceful protest into acts of disruption that is where the line will be crossed.’

Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative chairman, described protesters as ‘mindless bigots’ but said police have no option if they obey the law.

He said their actions will not provoke her supporters, adding: ‘Hopefully, those of us who admire Margaret Thatcher are too well-mannered to fall for the bait.’

Lady Thatcher’s former press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham accused police of ‘conniving at a display of bad taste.’

He said: ‘The plain fact is that we know exactly what these Left and anarchist groups do - they break convention and they enjoy doing it.

‘I’m absolutely certain there will be people who take great offence and are deeply upset by these protests because they don’t think it is the way to behave.’
