Ozzy Osbourne, who has said the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York made him feel 'excited' 

In a new interview, the 65-year-old recalled how he was in the city the day of the terrorist atrocities.

He explained that he was standing on the steps of his hotel in the city, describing the scene as, 'f***** weird.'

And when asked by Shortlist magazine if he was frightened, he replied: 'I wasn't scared, I was excited! It was my kind of craziness, y'know.' 

He then went on to describe the usually bustling streets of New York City as like an old cowboy film with newspapers floating around the streets. 

He added: 'It was so f****** weird. Everybody just backed off Manhattan because they didn't know if it was an all-out thing or what.'

However, he also spoke of his concern about the current threat of terrorism saying he hopes that ISIS 'don't get going'.

He explained: 'I think sooner or later one of these crazy f****** is going to get a nuclear weapon and f*** a lot of people up.'

The singer's comments came after he described meeting former president George W Bush after he was invited to the White House Correspondent's Dinner in 2002 with wife Sharon.

He said he had drank three bottles of wine before the dinner and admitted that he 'never quite got' the former US leader.

The couple attended the event shortly after their reality TV series starring the couple and children Kelly and Jack began to air.

Mrs Osbourne explained at the time: 'We were sitting at our table and George Bush started his speech, thanking 'members of the Press, movie stars, TV stars and Ozzy Osbourne'.

'Then he started talking about how his mother loved Ozzy's music. At this point, Ozzy stood up on his chair and the President was saying, 'Get down, Ozzy. Ozzy, get down!'
