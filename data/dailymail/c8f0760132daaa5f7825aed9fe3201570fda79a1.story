A heavily pregnant woman was captured on CCTV moments before she was brutally kicked to death in the street.

Eystna Blunnie is pictured walking in Harlow, Essex, in the early hours of June 27 last year just minutes before she suffered horrific head and facial injuries.

It is alleged that she was lured to her death by ex-fiance Tony McLernon who said 'I've got a surprise for you' before savagely killing her and her unborn baby.

On trial: Tony McLernon is accused of killing Eystna Blunnie and her unborn child in Harlow last year

Mr McLernon convinced Miss Blunnie to 
meet him in a street in Harlow, Essex, two days before she was due to 
give birth by telling her in a text message 'Got a surprise for you, 
hope you like it', Chelmsford Crown Court heard.

But
when the heavily pregnant 20-year-old met him in the early hours of 
June 27 last year, unemployed McLernon, fuelled by alcohol and cannabis,
forced her to the ground where he repeatedly kicked and stamped on her,
prosecutor Andrew Jackson said.

McLernon was also shown in CCTV footage heading from the opposite direction with his dog.

'It was an act of brutal, sustained and wholly unprovoked violence,' Mr Jackson added.

'He knew he was not only killing her but their unborn child as well.'

Residents living near the scene of the
alleged attack in the town's Howard Way, minutes from Ms Blunnie's 
home, heard her 'horrific' screams and the impact of the blows.

Ms Blunnie, who was due to give birth within days, was later found with severe head and facial injuries and died in hospital.

After the alleged killings, McLernon hid in nearby woodlands and sent a text message to his father saying 'I'm scared'.

He later spoke to his father on the phone and told him 'I think I've killed Eystna', the court heard.

Investigation: Police outside the home of Tony McLernon last year

Distraught: People lay flowers on the side of a main road in Harlow near to where Eystna Blunnie and her unborn baby were brutally beaten to death

Grief: Two friends console each other beside tributes to the college student who was due to give birth

McLernon, 24, from North Grove, 
Harlow, denies murdering Ms Blunnie and a charge of child destruction by
wilfully causing the death of an unborn child.

A series of text messages, sent by McLernon to friends and family, were read to the court.

In one, sent on June 23, he wrote: 'I f****** swear bro, I'm going to knife Eystna soon, she's proper ruining my relationship.'

Tragic: More friends of Eystna Blunnie, lay floral tributes at the scene. They have also written messages of condolence on Facebook

In other messages sent to his cousin, he claimed that Ms Blunnie had been contacting his new partner.

'I'm sure I'm going prison Monday, my ex is proper trying to ruin my relationship with my new girl,' he added.

Earlier he had sent a message to Ms Blunnie telling her she 'would not last or make it through her pregnancy'.

The couple had been together since April 2011 and got engaged three months later.

In October, Ms Blunnie told McLernon 
she was pregnant with his child but they broke up the following year 
after Ms Blunnie, a catering student and barmaid, made complaints to 
police that he had been abusing her.

Mr Jackson told jurors: 'It was a 
relationship marked by controlling, bullying and violent behaviour on 
the part of this defendant towards Eystna.

Shocking: A mourner reads some of the touching messages left at the spot where Miss Blunnie was found

'Within a month of the relationship 
beginning, family members saw Eystna with bruising to her arm and within
that bruising they saw the outline of knuckles.'

On one occasion, police were called to find Ms Blunnie with visible bruising.

She told officers the couple had argued all night with McLernon saying: 'The child is not mine. I could do better than you.'

Late on the night of June 26, McLernon and Ms Blunnie had exchanged text messages.

She had initially been reluctant to 
meet him but he convinced her with 'self-pitying messages designed to 
gain sympathy from Eystna a make her go to him', Mr Jackson said.

McLernon had a history of abusive relationships, the court heard. One woman reported him grabbing her by the throat in bed and attacking her in front of passers-by in a park.

Another called police after he painted the words 'whore and bitch' on walls near her home then threatened her on her doorstep.

Pathologist Nat Cary found the child had been a healthy girl who would otherwise have been born 'quite normally'.

A post-mortem examination showed Ms Blunnie, who was found in a pool of blood, suffered a severe brain injury as the result of repeated blows.

She suffered more than 50 separate injuries, with the heaviest bruising found on her face.Bits of her hair, matted with blood, were found around her body. The baby died from 'starvation of vital oxygen' as a result of the attack.

McLernon, wearing a dark suit and tie, appeared to hang his head as Ms Blunnie's father Kevin gave evidence.

Describing her, Mr Blunnie said: 'She was happy. She was looking forward to having her first child.

'She was a family girl and she tried her best at everything she did.'

He said he had initially been disappointed when he learnt his daughter was pregnant. But as she 'got her life back together', the family looked forward to Ms Blunnie's June 29 due date and she seemed happy.

The case continues.
