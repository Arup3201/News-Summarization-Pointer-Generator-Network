With one foot against the cliff, another stretching into the clouds and a graceful hand reaching  into the abyss, this brave dancer cuts an astonishing figure as she poses thousands of feet above the ground.

The gravity defying stance is just one the many acrobatic moves thrown by the daredevil dancer in this breathtaking series of images.

Adventure photographer Alex Buisse, 29, scaled the hills in the Brévent/Planpraz area of Aiguilles Rouges in the French Prealps to capture the dancer's graceful poses.

The shoot, which took place in August, took five hours to complete.

Athletic Agathe wears a harness to stretch and reach away from the cliff in some poses but in others she leaps across the rock without the use of any safety equipment.

Alex, who was amazed by Agathe's incredible feats, said: 'It seems people love seeing something that out of the ordinary.'

'Combining the beauty of perfect dancing movements with gorgeous natural landscapes is definitely appealing to a lot of people,' he added.

Alex spent time searching for the perfect space for his model, who is a Chamonix native, to strut her stuff without falling.

The combination of snow-peaked mountains and blue sky and sunshine create a beautiful backdrop for the inspirational images.

The France-based snapper is now planning on returning to the mountains to repeat the shoot.
