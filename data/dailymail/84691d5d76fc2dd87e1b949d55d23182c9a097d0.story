U.S. President Barack Obama has been urged to take decisive action against the Islamic State amid concerns the terror group will target America.

Obama was told by security experts that the country is facing a growing threat from militants, who have already taken control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq.

He was advised that these fighters are now looking toward the U.S. or Western Europe as their next targets, where they would likely 'kill with abandon'.

It comes as Texas senator Ted Cruz has claimed that America should deal with the threat of ISIS by bombing them 'back to the Stone Age'.

The 43-year-old Republican, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, told Fox News: 'They want to go back and reject modernity, well I think we should help them.

'We ought to bomb them back to the stone age.'

Cruz made his comments at a summit for Americans for Prosperity in Dallas on Saturday, during which he also spoke of the U.S. border immigration crisis and the Affordable Care Act.

Meanwhile, the two security experts, of the House and Senate intelligence committees, gave their warning to Obama at  Capitol Hill news conference in Washington on Sunday.

Without offering specifics on any 
threats or suggestions how to confront them, the pair said Obama 
soon needs to develop a comprehensive strategy to crush the fighters.

'His foreign policy is in absolute 
free-fall,' said Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who heads the 
House Intelligence Committee.

In another TV interview, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the 
Senate intelligence panel, said Obama is perhaps 'too cautious' in his 
approach to combating ISIS.

'This is a group of people who are extraordinarily dangerous,' Ms Feinstein said. 'And they'll kill with abandon.'

The
 pair of lawmakers, who have access to some of the nation's most 
sensitive secrets and receive regular and detailed briefings from the 
nation's spy agencies, offered dire predictions of an attack on the 
United States or its European allies if the militants are not 
confronted.

'They have 
announced that they don't intend to stop,' Ms Feinstein told NBC. 'They have 
announced that they will come after us if they can, that they will, 
quote, "spill our blood".''

The
 threat, Mr Rogers said, could include Americans who have trained with 
Islamic State fighters.

He told Fox News Sunday there are hundreds of Islamic 
State-trained Americans who can return to the country with their U.S. 
passports.

'I'm very 
concerned because we don't know every single person that has an American
 passport that has gone and trained and learned how to fight,' Mr Rogers 
said.

He added that the U.S. 
intelligence agencies were tracking the Americans who are known to have 
traveled to the region.

If they helped Islamic State fighters, he said, 
they should be charged under laws that prohibit Americans from aiding 
terrorists.

'ISIL would like
 to have a Western-style attack to continue this notion that they are 
the leading jihadist group in the world,' he said, using another 
name for the group.

The top 
Democrat on his intelligence panel, Republican C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of 
Maryland, was more skeptical.

He said more needs to be known before 
judging whether they plan to commit terrorist acts in the U.S. any time 
soon.

The group's priority now seems to be to hold on to territory it 
has gained rather than export violence.

'It is extremely urgent, but you don't just rush in,' he told CNN.

It
 was a view shared by Republication Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat on 
the House Armed Services Committee, who told CBS: 'We can't simply bomb first and ask 
questions later.'

Senator John 
McCain, an Arizona Republican who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee, urged fast action and said Islamic State fighters 'must be 
defeated, not contained,' because they represent a direct threat to the 
U.S.

Homeland Security Committee member Republican Peter King added: 'The longer we wait, the more dangerous" the group becomes.'

Execution: Ms Feinstein said she has seen nothing that compares to the viciousness of ISIS, which has overrun large portions of Iraq, killed civilians and beheaded U.S. journalist James Foley (seen just before his death)

Ms Feinstein
 said she has seen nothing that compares to the viciousness of the 
militants who have overrun large portions of Iraq, killed civilians and 
beheaded American journalist James Foley.

The Islamic State group has 
financing, military structure and weapons unlike any other militants, 
she said.

Obama said 
Thursday he did not yet have a strategy for dealing with the Islamic 
State organization, a remark that brought criticism from Democrats and 
Republicans.

In an interview published early this year by The New 
Yorker, the president appeared to minimize the group by comparing it to a
 junior varsity basketball team.

The White House said he was speaking 
about a different threat posed by a range of extremists across the 
world.

Mr Feinstein said she 
thought the basketball analogy was wrong — 'I think it's a major varsity
 team' — but would not say whether she thought Obama projected weakness 
by admitting he had no strategy.

'I
 think I've learned one thing about this president, and that is he's 
very cautious,' she said. 'Maybe in this instance, too cautious. I do 
know that the military, I know that the State Department, I know that 
others have been putting plans together. And so hopefully, those plans 
will coalesce into a strategy.'

During the Americans for Prosperity summit, Mr Cruz was joined by a number of other Republican White House candidates, including Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Governor Rick Perry and Indiana Governor Mike Pence.

Just days earlier, Mr Perry and Mr Paul had criticised Obama's 'we don't have a strategy yet' approach to the Islamic State threat. 

'Yesterday, the president admitted he had no strategy to deal with ISIS,' Mr Perry said.

'The deepening chaos in Iraq, Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine is all the clear and compelling evidence the world needs of a president one step behind, lurching from crisis to crisis.'
