Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Schalke centre back Benedikt Howedes.

Representatives were in the stands for the 4-0 win over Stuttgart last week and Howedes is liked as he is able to play left back, which is where he has figured for Germany.

The 26-year-old has admitted he is keen to move to England but has two years left on his contract and his Bundesliga club are reluctant to sell while they are still in the Champions League.

Schalke, who face Real Madrid in the last 16 of Europe's elite club competition, value Howedes around £15million.

Wenger wants cover for his defence but Howedes would expect to start regularly if he moved.

Arsenal have struggled in central defence this season after selling Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona last summer.

Laurent Koscielny missed a number of games due to injury, with Calum Chambers and full backs Nacho Monreal and Mathieu Debuchy having to fill in alongside Per Mertesacker.
