Four men have been detained by police as part of an investigation into the takeover of Glasgow Rangers Football Club in 2011. 

Gary Withey, David Grier, Paul Clark and David Whitehouse were held during early morning raids at a number of addresses across the UK.

Police Scotland have been investigating the sale of Rangers from Sir David Murray to Craig Whyte for over a year.  

Controversy: Sir David Murray, pictured left, sold Rangers to Craig Whyte (right) for £1 in May 2011

Mr Clark, Mr Whitehouse and Mr Grier worked for Duff & Phelps, the firm appointed as Rangers' administrators. 

Mr Withey worked for law firm Collyer Bristow, which represented Craig Whyte before he bought Rangers from Sir David Murray for £1 in 2011.

The men were held in an operation which involved officers from Surrey Police, Cheshire Police and Thames Valley Police.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Following a Police Scotland operation on Friday November 14, four men have been detained as a result of the ongoing investigation into the alleged fraudulent acquisition of Rangers Football Club.' 

Rangers manager Ally McCoist said: 'Obviously I can't or wouldn't comment on a current police matter, but I would have to say I'm shocked.

'Obviously I can't pre-judge what is going to happen.

'Our concern has always been for the staff and supporters. What's happened to us in the last two and a half, three years has been very tough, particularly on the staff and supporters.

'We just want to continue with out attempts to get the club back to where we feel we belong.'

It marks the latest development in three years of controversy for the blighted club.

Four men were detained by police on Monday as part of an investigation into the 2011 takeover of Rangers

In May 2011, Mr Murray, apparently under pressure from his bankers to recoup a club overdraft of about £18million amid huge debts in his own business empire, sold Rangers.

Mr Whyte bought an 85 per cent shareholding in the club £1 from the Murray Group and made several pledges in terms of future investment and paying off the club's bank debt.

At the time, a large tax liability regarding the club's payments through an Employee Benefit Trust - which were later outlawed - was also in dispute.

Rangers went into administration in February 2012 - less than a year after Mr Whyte took charge. 

Immediately after being appointed, administrators Duff & Phelps, where three of the men detained today worked, announced the club had failed to pay about £9million in PAYE and VAT since the takeover.

They soon revealed that the club had paid off the debt with Lloyds Banking Group from a £24.4m capital injection from investment firm Ticketus, which was secured on the back of future season ticket sales. 

In June 2012, Charles Green's consortium, Sevco Scotland, bought the club's assets and business from Mr Whyte in a deal worth £5.5million.

That same month a criminal investigation was launched into Craig Whyte's takeover of Rangers and the subsequent financial management of the club. It followed a preliminary examination of information passed to police by administrators.

It was confirmed last year that Mr Whyte has lost a £17.7m court case with Ticketus and he has been ordered pay back the money to the ticket agency following a hearing at the High Court in London.

Marty Dauer, Media Spokesperson for Duff & Phelps said: 'Duff & Phelps has become aware that three employees in the United Kingdom have been detained for questioning in connection with work performed for Rangers Football Club. 

'This work was commenced while these employees were part of MCR Partners, prior to its acquisition by Duff & Phelps in October of 2011.

'Duff & Phelps has performed an internal investigation and commissioned an independent investigation of the related matters. As a result, we believe that our work for Rangers was conscientious, thorough, and properly performed in every respect.'  

'The liquidator’s amended pleadings in English High Court proceedings commenced on April 8, 2011 validate the conclusions of our internal investigation and the independent investigation we commissioned.

'In addition, our assignments in this matter were comprehensively examined by the Insolvency Practitioners Association  in 2013. The IPA’s review cleared the firm of any wrongdoing or conflict of interest, affirming the position of the firm.'

He added that the company has cooperated with investigating authorities and has provided reports on its role in the administration of Rangers.

2000 - Rangers begin making payments through an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT), which was set up by major shareholder Murray International Holdings (MIH).

2006 - The club's annual report reveals a £9.2million 'contribution to employee trusts', the high point of the payments. The sum was included in staff costs of £28million.

April 2010 - Rangers confirm they are under investigation by HMRC over offshore payments to players from 2001. Rangers say they will 'robustly' defend the case.

December 2010 - EBTs are outlawed under new legislation.

May 2011 - Craig Whyte bought Rangers from Sir Daivd Murray for £1 and made a commitment to settle its £18million debt with Lloyds Bank. The tax liability was still in dispute.

January 2012 - A three-day first tier tax tribunal closes in Edinburgh, following earlier hearings to determine whether Rangers are guilty of tax evasion.

February 2012 - The Glasgow club entered administration over a non-payment of tax totalling roughly £14million. 

It emerges during the administration process that Mr Whyte paid off the Lloyds Bank debt by pledging future season ticket sales to finance company Ticketus for £25million. 

March 2012 - The Scottish Football Association (SFA) confirms it will investigate claims made by former Rangers director Hugh Adam that payments made to players were not disclosed to the governing body.

Three days later, the Scottish Premier League (SPL) confirms that its board has instigated an investigation into the alleged non-disclosure of payments made to players by Rangers, which prompts the SFA to drop its case.

May 2012 - A BBC documentary team claims 63 Rangers players and 24 staff members received EBT payments and says 53 of them were provided with 'side letters' detailing the structure of payments.

The following week, Duff and Phelps, the firm hired as Rangers' administrators, provide files requested by the SPL in their investigation into undisclosed payments.

June 2012 - A criminal inquiry is launched into Mr Whyte’s takeover when the Crown Office asked Strathclyde Police, now part of national force Police Scotland, to investigate the purchase and the club’s subsequent financial management.

Rangers enter liquidation after HMRC rejects a Company Voluntary Arrangement proposal. 

Charles Green's Sevco Scotland company buys the club's assets and business in a deal worth £5.5million and begins the process of relaunching the club as a new company.

July 2012 - Mr Green accepted a vote that placed his new club in Division Three. 

August 2012 - The SPL appoints an independent commission to probe the contentious payments. Sir David Murray denies cheating took place during his stewardship.

November 2012 - Oldco Rangers win their first-tier tax tribunal appeal in principle against HMRC's demands over EBT payments.

January 2013 - The SPL commission begins hearing evidence.

February 2013 - Oldco Rangers are handed a fine of £250,000 for breaching rules over disclosing payments but the club avoid being stripped of titles after the commission finds they obtained no sporting advantage.

April 2013 - Mr Whyte was ordered to pay £18m to Ticketus after he lost a claim against him at the High Court in London.

July 2014 - HMRC's appeal to the upper-tier tribunal is largely dismissed.

September 2014 - Mr Whyte was banned from being a company director for a maximum of 15 years.

November 2014 - Four men arrested by police in connection to the alleged fraudulent takeover of the club.
