Heathrow and Gatwick airports could be linked by a high speed rail network to create the world's first 'virtual hub' airport under proposals being considered by ministers.

Dubbed 'Heathwick', the scheme would see a £5 billion high-speed rail service linking the west London site to west Sussex in 15 minutes.

Travelling at speeds of 180mph, trains would leave every five minutes and would follow the route of the M25.

Heathwick would need to transfer passengers and their baggage from one airport to the other within 75 minutes in order to be considered a hub.

It is hoped the scheme would ease the congestion of flights over the capital.

The plans have been welcomed by Gatwick airport and business groups.

However BAA - the operator of Heathrow - and the budget airlines of Ryanair and EasyJet are firmly against the idea.

Speaking to The Times, BAA said: 'A virtual hub between Heathrow and Gatwick faces insurmountable technical, operational, political and financial challenges, and would take many years to deliver.

'It provides no extra runway capacity in the South East, which is the key problem identified by the Department for Transport's own passenger forecast'.

Business leaders, however, are piling pressure on the government to develop air links following concerns that Britain risks losing trade deals with emerging markets such as China and Brazil.

Supporters argue that Heathwick would provide a quicker and cheaper answer to capacity problems at Britain's airports rather than building a new airport in the Thames Estuary.

They say Heathwick would allow London's airports to better compete with Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt and Schiphol by encouraging more transfers.

Britain currently loses £1.2 billion a year to the Netherlands, Germany and France.

Victoria Borwick, a member of the transport committee on the Greater London Assembly, is keen for the scheme to go ahead.

Speaking to The Times, she said: 'There are all sorts of ideas about but most of them are long-term. None of them addresses the issue of capacity that faces us now.

'If we can link Heathrow and Gatwick in 15 minutes, that would be phenomenal.'

The proposals to create the world's first 'virtual hub' airport between Heathrow and Gatwick have not gone down well with budget airlines.

The 'Heathwick' scheme would see Gatwick focusing on short and medium-haul flights to and from Europe while Heathrow would focus on long-haul destinations.

Low cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair would be encouraged to leave Gatwick for Stansted and Luton airports to create extra capacity for flights from the west Sussex site.

However, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary is firmly against the proposals.

Speaking to the Financial Times, he said there was 'no way of moving the budget airlines out of Gatwick'.

He added: 'There won't be a high speed rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick in my lifetime. The cost of it would be prohibitive'.

EasyJet was also dismissive about the scheme, saying: 'EasyJet will fight any attempt to force us out of Gatwick all the way'.

Professor David Begg, chairman of the British Chambers of Commerce infrastructure Commission, said trade with markets to which Britain is connected with direct flights is 20 times greater than with those it does not.

Speaking to The Times, he said: 'Hub airports need a large percentage of transfer passengers to make their wide and far-reaching network of routes economic. It is this connectivity which is crucial to our economy.'

The Government is currently reviewing aviation policy and examining how to expand air capacity around London without jeopardising green targets.

It follows the coalition overturning plans for a third runway at Heathrow.

Two of the potential problems with the scheme are that both airports have different owners and in the current economic uncertainty funding could also be an issue.

Taxpayers are already forking out £2 billion a year for the Crossrail project, which will not be finished before 2018.

Bosses at Gatwick airport are positive about Heathwick, saying: 'We would be very pleased to discuss the idea further with ministers'.
