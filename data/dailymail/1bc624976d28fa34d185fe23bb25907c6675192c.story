Wild West: An angry stylist brought a gun to Derek J's salon

It began as a minor dispute between two hair stylists over a dissatisfied client.

But it quickly deteriorated into a shootout better suited to a Wild West saloon than a celebrity salon after a furious hairdresser opened fire on his rival.

The bizarre incident took place at Atlanta’s J Spot Salon, the studio of Derek J, who regularly appears on the hit show Real Housewives of Atlanta.

A fellow hairdresser, identified by 
Derek J only as Corwin, had an appointment with Neffe Pugh - the sister 
of R&B singer Keisha Cole.

He had completed the style at a salon across town – but she was unhappy with the finished product and came to The J Spot to to have the hairstyle fixed.

'(Corwin)
put a lace front unit on her hair – a glued down wig - and we couldn’t 
get it off,' Derek J told MailOnline.

‘Her (hair was) messed up to the 
point we didn’t know what to do.

'She was just trying to fix what was going on.'

That's when they called the stylist on the phone. 'We reached out to him on a professional level,' he said.

'That conversation turned bad, quickly.

'But we thought it was an argument over the phone and it was over with.'

But that's when the real trouble started.

'About four hours later, he showed up
to the salon,' he told MailOnline.

'My receptionist came around and 
said, "There’s a guy here to see you, he’s really upset."

'He walks away and comes back with a 
gun, and then he points the gun to the ground,' Derek J said.

'He kept 
saying, You don't think I will?'

He aimed the gun at the floor and shot, but thankfully, no one was hurt.

Pugh was not in the salon at that point.

Though the incident could have been much worse, Derek J, who has also appeared in the movie Good Hair, is furious.

‘I’m upset because my floor is messed
up now,’ he said, adding that he never thought a fellow stylist would bring a
gun to the workplace.

'This’s something that shouldn’t have happened,' he said.

'People say bad things about me all 
the time, but you can’t go off and try to pull a gun on somebody. It’s a
ridiculous situation.'

Proof: The stylist allegedly fired the gun once, leaving a not-so-subtle dent in the salon's floor

He called the police 'as a precaution' 
and said that he's upset this story in particular made the news. 'We do 
so many other things for the community,' he said.

Atlanta police are currently looking for the gun-toting stylist.

Derek J said he'll face charges of aggravated assault for every person he pointed the gun at – six people – and a discharge for a weapon in a public place.
