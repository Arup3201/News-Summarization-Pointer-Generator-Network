Premier League clubs need to give their young players a bigger taste of life in the first-team and make them believe they can forge careers as professionals, according to Gary Neville.

The former Manchester United and England defender fears that academy players do not have a clear pathway from youth to senior football and that the money invested in state-of-the-art facilities will be of little use if top-flight managers fail to take an interest in young talent.

Manchester City unveiled their new £200million Football Academy earlier this week but Neville, who came through United's youth ranks, is adamant that clubs must immerse their youngsters in the first-team environment, too.

In his column for The Daily Telegraph, Neville wrote: 'When we were 16 or 17, in our early days as Manchester United YTS apprentices, Norman Davies, the kit man, would drive a couple of us in a white van to a first team game to help him put the kit out.

'We would sit in the first-team dressing room after laying out the shirts and shorts, waiting for the senior side to arrive. It was an incredible experience for us as young lads. I remember one trip with Chris Casper, over the top of the moors to Blackburn, when Rovers were doing well in the top flight, and listening to Sir Alex Ferguson rip into Gary Pallister for letting Alan Shearer pull off the back of him and score. 

'Norman would look after us. We were there to absorb the first-team culture. We were there to understand how it worked, what it meant, and I remember how big it felt for me when the first team walked into that room, even though I had been at United from the age of 11. To travel with the kit and be immersed in the first-team ethos was to feel part of a continuous link from youth team to Premier League starting XI. It was an inspiration, a pathway all the way through the club.'

Neville admits that things changed at United when the club left The Cliff and moved to a new training base at Carrington, but he maintains that the system he came through gave him the best chance of making an impact under Sir Alex Ferguson.

'Academies are not about bricks and mortar,' he wrote. 'They are about culture and integration. What about a mentoring system, where a first-team player has a meal with a youth team player once a week and talks to him about standards? Should they not be pushed closer to the first-team rather than further away?'

Chelsea gave a first-team debut to 18-year-old Ruben Loftus-Cheek against Sporting Lisbon, with the talented midfielder coming off the bench at Stamford Bridge.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho had claimed Wednesday's game would be 'academy day', although Loftus-Cheek's late substitute appearance failed to back up his manager's words.

Sky Sports pundit Neville added: 'Loftus-Cheek was paraded like some kind of exotic creature. Look, an academy player in the first-team! We lined up in the Sky studio excited at the thought of seeing homegrown talent in a Chelsea side. When he played for eight minutes, we showed the highlights of it as a special segment. We were seeing a rare species.'

With every Premier League club keen to develop their own talent as Financial Fair Play rules hinder their ability to spend, the importance of academies has arguably never been greater.

'Chelsea and City have built the most incredible factories, but what really counts is the people, culture and most importantly belief and risk in giving youth a chance,' wrote Neville. 'It's time to follow through now. If they don't, these expensive academies will be just obscene cosmetic surgery.'
