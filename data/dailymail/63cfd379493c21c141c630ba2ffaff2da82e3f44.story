A harbor patrolman and an unidentified man are dead after storm winds broke boats loose from moorings at Santa Catalina Island off the Southern California mainland.

The incident occurred late on Tuesday in Avalon Harbor, where several power boats were pushed aground along the waterfront when 40 mph winds hit.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department says harbor personnel and deputies were attempting to secure loose boats when a Harbor Department boat came close to hitting rocks.

Storm aftermath: The death occurred late Tuesday in Avalon Harbor, where several power boats were pushed aground along the waterfront and a patrolman jumped from the boat with deputies  unable to rescue him

A patrolman jumped from the boat and deputies were unable to rescue him before he became lodged between the boat and rocks under turbulent waves.

'The conditions were so horrible, they were unable to go in after him,'Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Nicole Nishida told the Los Angeles Times.

A civilian's body was discovered floating at 6:30 a.m. and the patrolman's body was recovered later by divers.

A third person was initially believed to be missing.

Nishida told the Los Angeles Times that Avalon Harbor looked like it had been struck by a hurricane.

It 'took a beating,' Kades said.

'Boats were knocked loose.'

The storm on Tuesday brought frigid temperatures and immobilizing snow that stranded hundreds of drivers on mountain roads across Southern California.
