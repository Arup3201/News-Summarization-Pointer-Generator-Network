Roy Hodgson has admitted talking with Manchester United and England left back Luke Shaw at the World Cup amid increasing concerns about his fitness.

Shaw, 19, the world’s costliest teenager when he left Southampton for Old Trafford in a £28million deal, was heavily criticised by United manager Louis van Gaal over his training regime.

And Hodgson, who named Wayne Rooney as England’s new captain in his first squad since Brazil 2014, seems to have similar concerns.

Fitness concerns: Hodgson admits he spoke to Shaw about his fitness during the World Cup

He said: ‘He might have had it mentioned to him a couple of times during the World Cup when we were together by people like myself and Gary Lewin (England’s head physio).

‘When Van Gaal talks to Mauricio Pochettino then Pochettino will say to him, “What you were saying to Luke Shaw is what I’ve been saying to him”.

‘I think a lot of Luke’s situation is purely down to the fact that he is still young, his body is changing but I think he’s aware that the work-rate which is required does mean he’s got to work very, very hard on that aspect of his game.

‘I must say, watching him play in the matches for Southampton — which caused me to select him — and watching him in the game against Costa Rica when he played, he didn’t seem to have too many problems coping with the physical side of the game.

Having words: Louis van Gaal put Shaw on a special fitness regime during pre-season

‘That doesn’t mean to say he can’t be fitter and if Louis thinks that he can get him fitter then I’m sure he will certainly have our approval.

‘Luke’s been aware of it and he will get fitter and stronger, not least of all because he’s still a very young man and his body has not yet reached its proper proportions for the level he wants to play at.’

Shaw is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury and has not been named in Hodgson’s England squad for Wednesday’s friendly with Norway at Wembley and the Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland five days later. The United left back, who turned 19 in July, is still living in a city-centre hotel in Manchester and is struggling to adapt to his new surroundings.

Shaw is just one of several United players who have been on the end of Van Gaal’s volatile moods as he continues to search for his first competitive victory in charge.

Making his point: Hodgson believes much of Shaw's issues are to do with the fact he is young 

Yesterday, Hodgson began a new chapter with England after making some radical changes to the squad for the games against Norway and Switzerland.

Arsenal defender Calum Chambers, Tottenham left back Danny Rose, Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback and Aston Villa’s Fabian Delph have been named in a new-look squad.

Rooney, who has 95 caps for his country, was confirmed as England captain following Steven Gerrard’s retirement from international football.Hodgson’s decision to select Colback, who has made two appearances in the Barclays Premier League for his new club since his move from Sunderland, is eye-catching.

Hodgson said: ‘Someone who knows him well up there called him “the ginger Pirlo” and it would be delightful if that epithet turns out to be the correct one. I think that would be a hard ask.

New leader: Wayne Rooney was named the new England captain by Hodgson

‘We followed him in the opening games and I was at Aston Villa v Newcastle.

At the moment, we have lost three central midfielders in Gerrard, Lampard (both retired) and Carrick (injured).

‘He plays in a position where vacancies can easily arise and we have to see how he gets on.’ Hodgson has a number of injuries to contend with. Shaw, Ross Barkley, Adam Lallana, Glen Johnson and Chris Smalling are absent from the squad.

Colback, has already been nicknamed Jack Colbeckenbauer by fans in the North East and yesterday his club manager, Alan Pardew, likened him to England 1966 World Cup winner Alan Ball.

‘He’s a terrific player. The last time we won a World Cup we had a ginger in Alan Ball. Now we’ve got another one. It’s about time,’ said Pardew.

After naming Rooney as captain England’s manager surprisingly admitted the player had ‘baggage’.

He said: ‘It is wrong, I think, for me to look back too much into the past and any mis-demeanors the player may have had.

‘I’ve got to say in the two years he has been with me, I’ve had no reason at any time to question anything about his character, his desire to play for the country and the wholehearted, willingness to offer himself in any conceivable situation.

‘He has that baggage with him and he will have to accept that as a further part of the pressure along the way because, unfortunately, you can’t draw a line over the past.’
