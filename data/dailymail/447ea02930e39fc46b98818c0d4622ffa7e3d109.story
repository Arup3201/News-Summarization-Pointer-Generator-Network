A lone gunman boarded a school bus, shooting dead its driver, and taking a six-year-old passenger hostage, authorities revealed Tuesday.

The shooter, cited by many news sources to be 65-year-old Jimmy Lee Dykes, has barricaded himself in a bunker-like structure in his back yard, and continues to hold the child hostage.

The Dothan Eagle reports that Dykes was supposed to appear in court on Wednesday for a bench trial over a menacing charge.

A suspect, identified as Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, allegedly held up a school bus Tuesday in Midland City, Alabama, shooting dead the bus driver and taking a boy hostage

Dykesâ€™ neighbor, James Edward Davis Jr told the paper that the man pointed a gun at him and his daughter in December, saying that they had driven into his yard.

The Dale County Sheriff confirmed that a man shot the driver in Midland City on Tuesday.

Children on the bus said that the man who boarded the bus told most of the students to get off. They then said that the man shot the bus driver several times.

The driver later died of his wounds. His identity wasn't immediately released.

uthorities say the shooter took the child to an area behind nearby Destiny Church. WSFA reported that bomb squads were called to the scene, though there was no sign of explosive devices.

The shooting comes at a time when gun violence in schools is on everyone's mind, nearly two months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School schooting

Residents in the immediate area were also evacuated as a precaution.

Midland City police would not comment, and a call to the Dale City Sheriff's office was not answered Tuesday.

However, it was reported that members of a SWAT team are communicating with the suspect in his bunker via a PVC pipe.

The shooting comes as the nation is on edge about gun violence, especially in schools, after a gunman shot dead 20 students and six staff members at a Connecticut elementary school last month, stoking a national debate on gun control.

The sheriff's department said multiple agencies were assisting with the incident and local area schools would be closed on Wednesday.
