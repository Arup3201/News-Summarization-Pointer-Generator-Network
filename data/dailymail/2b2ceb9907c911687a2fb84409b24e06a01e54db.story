Fiona Taylor, 44, bought fake bags from China and sold them as the real thing, making a huge profit

A woman who made more than £400,000 selling fake designer handbags spent the money on school fees for her children and luxury goods for herself.

Fiona Taylor, 44, of Newton on Ouse, North Yorkshire, organised 'handbag parties' where she sold counterfeit bags for hundreds of pounds each, telling buyers they were the real thing.

The mother of two laundered cheques through her son's bank account and spent the money on luxury goods, private school fees, holidays and a new car, a court heard.

Teesside Crown Court was told that Taylor sold fake Mulberry bags at the parties which she organised across North Yorkshire, telling one woman they were sourced through a contact at Mulberry's own factory.

In fact, the bags came from counterfeiters in China, and they quickly fell to bits, prompting complaints from customers.

Richard Bennett, prosecuting, said Taylor paid more than £250,000 to Chinese counterfeit suppliers over five and a half years.

He told the court she made regular substantial payments between November 2007 and May 2013 totalling £273,071.

Mr Bennett said she had earned £418,687 by selling fake goods, which meant she'd made a profit of £145,616.

He told the court that one complainant attended a handbag party at the home of a friend in October 2009, buying a handbag which subsequently fell apart.

Another woman paid Taylor £585 for two Mulberry bags, a Jimmy Choo purse and another purse.

She later found that the serial number on one of the bags, bought for her daughter, was fake and when it was sent to Mulberry they confirmed it was counterfeit.

So many of Taylor's customers contacted the genuine Mulberry store in York that the firm contacted Trading Standards.

Mr Bennett said Taylor signed a declaration stating she would stop selling such goods, but it had little effect in discouraging her.

In June last year Taylor's home was searched and a large number of fake Mulberry, Gucci, Louis Vitton, Prada and Chanel bags and other items were seized.

Susanna Proctor, defending, said Taylor had been made redundant from her job in a bank and - without a source of income - began buying bags for friends.

The real thing: But Taylor wasn't selling genuine bags by Louis Vuitton, left, or Mulberry, right, like these

Ms Proctor said: 'People were texting her and asking for bags and it snowballed out of her control.

'She is incredibly ashamed of her behaviour and is terrified of going to prison.'

Taylor admitted two counts of selling counterfeit goods, two counts of concealing criminal property and 14 counts of possessing criminal property.

Judge Peter Armstrong said organised criminals were benefitting from the counterfeit trade.

'That is why these offences are so serious,' he said.

The judge said he took into account Taylor's early guilty pleas, references and previous good character, and handed her a three-month jail sentence, suspended for two years.

He also ordered Taylor to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, and a proceeds of crime hearing will take place at a later date.
