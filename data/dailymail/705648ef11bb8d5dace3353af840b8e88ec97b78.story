Luke Maslen was jailed for four years for having sex with the teenage girls 

A PE teacher was jailed for four years yesterday after having sex with two teenage pupils who he groomed with flirty online messages and trips to McDonald’s.

Luke Maslen, 24, slept with one youngster who was under 16 after giving her cuddly toys and promising to marry her.

He also swapped 200 text messages a day with the second girl and professed his love for her – before having sex with her in his car.

He approached the two victims separately on social media in 2012, just a year after joining the staff at Callington Community College in east Cornwall. Prosecutor Garth Richardson said he was in a ‘position of trust’ as a teacher but went on to have sex with both teenagers.

The older of the girls, who was over 16 at the time, said Maslen’s contact with her began as ‘banter’ on Twitter but they were soon exchanging intimate text messages. She said he asked to meet and drove her to a remote beach, where they sat in his car for an hour. The girl told Truro Crown Court: ‘He kissed me. He texted me later saying “I really like you. I think this could go somewhere”.’

She said on another occasion he sent her a message saying ‘I think I love you’. They went on two other drives and once parked by a lake.

She said: ‘He was being really persistent. We just had sex in his car. I did not want to have sex in a car in a lay-by. It is not very romantic for your first time with him.’

Maslen, of Pensilva, Cornwall, told police he was friends with the girl but denied having sex with her.

Mr Richardson said the younger girl had sex with the teacher at his home and in her own bedroom. The girl’s mother found out when social workers asked her to take her daughter to the police for questioning. The Crown said: ‘Her daughter said they had sex four or maybe three times and at one point he had even asked her to marry him and told her to keep it secret.’

The girl said he picked her up and drove her to McDonald’s and bought her gifts of flowers and cuddly toys. ‘She told him she was falling in love with him. He told her nothing could happen because he was a teacher.’

Maslen denied having sex with either girl. His lawyer Rupert Taylor told the court: ‘Luke Maslen was foolish and he was in love but he said they did not have intercourse.’

The teacher broke down in tears when a jury convicted him last month of seven counts of sexual activity with a young person.

At a sentencing hearing yesterday judge Christopher Harvey Clark QC said he had been convicted on powerful evidence. Maslen, whose teaching career lies in ruins, was placed on the Sex Offenders Register.
