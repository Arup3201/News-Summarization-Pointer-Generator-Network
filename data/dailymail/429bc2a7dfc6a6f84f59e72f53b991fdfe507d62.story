Arjen Robben believes his attempt to con the referee early in Sunday’s dramatic last-16 win over Mexico did not influence the result or the penalty decision that came after he again fell theatrically under a challenge.

The Dutch FA reacted aggressively on Monday when they realised just how much profile had been given to Robben’s post-match admission that he had tried to illegally win a free-kick during the 2-1 win in Fortaleza.

However, after learning that FIFA would not take any retrospective action following his admission of gamesmanship, Robben attended a specially arranged press conference on Monday and reiterated his confession of the night before.

Admission: Arjen Robben has confessed to diving during the first half of Holland's victory over Mexico

Turning point: Arjen Robben's left foot is clipped by the boot of Mexico defender Rafael Marquez

Theatrics: Robben fell under the challenge but his reaction was what convinced the referee

‘I was not afraid of FIFA action, no,’ said Robben. 

‘I
 am an honest guy but it had no influence on the game. It’s a shame 
because yesterday in an interview after the game I was very honest. 

‘Maybe sometimes you are punished for honesty, but I always prefer to be honest.‘I
 said there was one foul in the first half where I went to the ground 
because I thought he would tackle me, but he took his leg away at the 
last moment and I went to the ground without a touch.

‘It was a stupid action from me, but it had no influence on the game, had nothing to do with the penalty kick.

‘In the first half we should have had a penalty kick, in the second half the penalty at the end was a clear foul.

‘It
 is a shame there is so much discussion because we put on a great 
performance as a team. That should be the main thing. Sometimes, you 
know, I like to be honest and I apologise for this action in the first 
half, but that is football. It had nothing to do with the result of the 
game.’

Outraged: Mexico coach Miguel Herrera remonstrates with officials and Dutch players at the full time whistle

Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, scorer of Holland’s injury-time winner against Mexico on Sunday, has more goals (35) than starts (34) for the national team.

Robben
 was accused of diving three times by Mexico coach Miguel Herrera after 
his team’s defeat and it is clear the Bayern Munich winger will come 
under scrutiny when Holland face Costa Rica here on Saturday.

Herrera believes that Robben dived to win the decisive penalty at the death. 

‘I don’t change myself,’ said Robben. ‘That’s my personality.

‘I think it’s good. I apologised for one stupid action, but it didn’t have an influence in the game.

‘We had two clear penalties, one was given. That is it. I don’t think we should talk about it any more.’

Decider: Marquez appeals after Robben goes down for the late penalty that won Holland the game

Holland will remain at the training base in Rio until Thursday before heading north to Salvador ahead of Saturday’s game.

And
 coach Louis van Gaal has told his star striker Robin van Persie that he
 will be sacrificed if he isn’t fit enough or playing well enough.

Van
 Gaal and his captain Van Persie are thought to have a unique bond that 
Manchester United fans will hope can continue when the veteran coach 
starts life at Old Trafford after the World Cup.

But
 Van Gaal hauled Van Persie off 15 minutes from the end of Sunday 
night’s dramatic win and watched as his replacement Klaas-Jan Huntelaar 
set up one goal and scored the winner from the penalty spot.

Afterwards, Van Gaal was asked if Van Persie was injured and said: ‘No. The substitution of Van Persie was tactical.

‘Let’s not forget before he joined team he was recovering from an injury.

‘It’s
 difficult for him to keep up 90 minutes especially in these conditions.
 Anyway, this trainer wants to win. So he makes the changes and the 
substitutions he needs.

‘It’s simple. Nothing else matters.’ 

Van
 Persie is still expected to start in Saturday’s quarter-final but 
holding midfielder Nigel de Jong is unlikely to recover from the groin 
injury that forced him off the field early on in the Mexico game.

‘I don’t know but I think it might be difficult,’ added Van Gaal. ‘It is a muscle injury.’

Decisive: Louis van Gaal substituted a subdued Van Persie against Mexico and Holland went on to win

Van
 Gaal has denied that his team have a straight forward route to the last
 four, even though quarter-final opponents Costa Rica are ranked 28th in
 the world and had to play extra-time against Greece on Sunday.

‘Let
 me tell you the Dutch media thought we would never survive the first 
round, so how we ended up becoming up favourites, I’ll never know,’ he 
said.

‘This group of players is very modest.

‘We have outstanding spirit, outstanding atmosphere, and that led to victory.

‘Costa Rica very difficult opponents, otherwise they wouldn’t have ended up in a quarter-final.’
