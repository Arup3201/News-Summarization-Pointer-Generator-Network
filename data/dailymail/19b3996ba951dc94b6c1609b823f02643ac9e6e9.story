Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has approved a bill which paves the way for legalising medical marijuana

The President of Colombia has endorsed new legislation which paves the way for legalising medical cannabis.

Juan Manuel Santos made the announcement yesterday at a drug policy forum in the capital Bogota.

Mr Santos called the bill 'a practical, compassionate measure to reduce the pain (and) anxiety of patients with terminal illnesses' while adding that it would help combat crime.

Colombia has been wracked by decades of conflict with left-wing rebels inside the country, who are largely funded with drug money.

The nation is only the latest in a string of countries in South America to legalise cannabis. 

Uruguay has already approved sales of the drug, while Jamaica is set to decriminalise it for religious and medicinal purposes, allowing people to carry up to two ounces.

Colombia already allows people to legally carry half that amount, but the new bill would remove that cap completely. 

The medicinal-use bill was introduced by Sen. Juan Manuel Galan, whose father was assassinated in 1989 by cocaine traffickers. He said other countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Chile were considering similar pieces of legislation.

Galan said his hope is that his bill, which would put the distribution of medical marijuana under government control, gain final approval next June.

Ethan Nadelmann, director of the New York-based Drug Policy Alliance, said some U.S. states as well as countries including Israel and Canada are already offering  legal medical marijuana, and that a bill was introduced last week in the Central American nation of Costa Rica.

In Colombia the govenrment has been fighting left-wing rebels for years, who largely fund themselves through the sale of drugs such as cocaine and marijuana.

The commander of Colombia's anti-drug police, Gen. Ricardo Restrepo, said the country currently has about 1.5 square miles (390 hectares) of marijuana fields producing the drug for $230 per lb.

Colombia is the world's No. 2 cocaine-producing country after Peru, according to the United Nations and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. It was the global leader until 2012.

A two-decade U.S.-backed crackdown on Colombia's drug cartels and extensive aerial eradication of coca crops has hampered the trade, but failed to eradicate it. 

Critics say the campaign has simply shifted trafficking to countries with less effective law enforcement and legal systems.

The human cost of the fight against illegal drugs has been terrible for Colombia and other supply and transit countries, Santos told the forum.

'We have spent billions of dollars on an ineffective war that has claimed more than 60,000 lives in Mexico alone in the last six years,' he said.
