A 13-year-old-boy is due to stand trial in Louisiana on Wednesday, accused of the second-degree murder of his five-year-old half sister.

Devalon Armstrong allegedly used wrestling moves he had seen on television on Viloude Louis, who died from the brutal beating on June 16 in Terrytown.

The little girl suffered broken ribs, internal bleeding and a
lacerated liver after Armstrong repeatedly slammed her on a bed, punched her in the stomach, jumped on her and struck her with his elbow several times, police said.

Tragic: Five-year-old Viloude Louis died of horrific injuries in June, allegedly inflicted by her half brother Devalon Armstrong, as he practiced wrestling moves on the girl

Judge Andrea Price Janzen will hear testimony today and then rule whether the boy will be charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter or negligent homicide. He could also be acquitted.

The Times-Picayune reported that if Armstrong was convicted as charged he would get 'juvenile life', which would mean imprisonment until his 21st birthday.

The teenager, who is also known as Armstrong Desvallons, told officers that he was practicing wrestling moves on his sister while their mother, 39-year-old Adlourdes Desvallons, was out.

But Juvenile Court Judge Janzen will not let prosecutors use the tape where he confesses this as evidence during Wednesday's trial.

Victim: Viloude Louis, 5, was found unconscious on the floor after she was brutally beaten

As reported by The Advocate, the judge ruled in September that neither the boy nor the mother really understood how this statement could be used against him.

Deputies say they received a 911 call 
from the home on June 16 saying the girl had been found unconscious on the bathroom floor.

Paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she 
was pronounced dead a short time later.

Armstrong was arrested after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries, two days after the death, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's spokesman Col. John Fortunato said.

Detectives initially spoke with the girl's mother and found out that the teenager had been babysitting while she went shopping, Fortunato told The Times-Picayune.

Devalon told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to brush her teeth, and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor complaining her stomach still hurt, Fortunato said.

The teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911 when he saw she was no longer breathing. Dispatchers told him to start CPR and paramedics arrived on the scene.

The coroner's office said there did not appear to be any outward signs of injury and her death was left as unclassified, but then Devalon told detectives he had been practicing World Wrestling Entertainment-style moves on the girl,  The Times-Picayune reported.

He said that even when his little half sister said she was in pain, he continued to carry out the moves on her. Detectives added that he appeared to be enjoying talking about the assault.

The Sheriff's office reclassified her death as a homicide and Devalon was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder. He has been held at a juvenile detention center since the incident.
