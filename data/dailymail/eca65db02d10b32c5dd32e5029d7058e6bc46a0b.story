The Duchess of Cambridge in her £415 leather waistcoat, made by Really Wild Clothing Company

It has been dubbed the 'Duchess effect', formerly known as 'the Middleton effect'.

And it has seen sales in items - from Burberry trench-coats and Issa dresses, to flesh-toned tights and even spaniels - skyrocket immediately after the Duchess of Cambridge is spotted wearing (or walking) them.

In fact, so enamoured are we with Prince William's wife's wardrobe that we will replicate even her more unusual sartorial choices - most recently a £415 leather waistcoat, worn by Kate on a trip to Wrotham, Kent.

As soon as the Duchess was photographed wearing the dark green jerkin on a visit to the ‘Expanding Horizons’ primary school scheme at Widehorizons Margaret McMillan House, its manufacturers  the Really Wild Clothing Company were inundated with calls.

'We have already seen an increase in enquiries for the waistcoat, which will doubtlessly mean a rise in sales,' said a spokesman for the Berkshire-based company.

'There has been particular interest from America, where the Royal Family has huge appeal, but also from England.'

The unique Fitted Nubuck Waistcoat has deep pockets and an adjustable waistband, and is 'ideal for a day's shooting or for just being in the country', according to the company's website.

The £300 leather-lined green wellies Kate wore on her visit have also been receiving attention.

Emma Parkin, Head of UK Marketing for the 80-year-old French bootmaker Le Chameau,  said: 'We have noticed more interest in the boots since the Duchess wore them, as you might expect.'

The Duchess was in Kent meeting 28 
inner-city children, aged eight and nine, from the King Solomon Academy 
Primary School, based in North Westminster, London.

Le Chameau has received more enquiries than ever since Kate wore their £300 boots

An area of high deprivation, more than 70 per cent of children under 15 in the area live in a jobless household.

For many of the children, aged between and eight and nine years old, it was the first time they had seen the countryside or been away from home.

Widehorizons run outdoor learning experiences, and on their three-day residential course the children sleep in tipi tents and take part in team-building activities including rope challenges, obstacle courses, campfire building and outdoor cooking.
