A top sports agent who inspired Tom Cruise's character in the hit movie Jerry Maguire is wanted over a $1.4 million debt over unpaid rent.

Leigh Steinberg, who has represented NFL stars Troy Aikman and boxer Oscar De La Hoya, has had a bench warrant issued for his arrest.

Orange County Superior Court said it was after he failed to appear last week for a case involving a judgment owed to the landlords of his Newport Beach office.

Court papers show the 62-year-old, whose roster has included eight No 1 overall NFL draft picks and who lives in California, was ordered to pay $1.4 million last year to the Irvine Company.

But he stopped paying under the terms of his lease in 2009, according to court papers filed by the landlord, which declined to comment on the case.

Steinberg defended his court no-show by saying he had asked his attorney to change the date of his December 15 hearing and was told it was taken care of.

He said he was unaware he had a warrant in the case, which stems from some payments he missed in 2009 before moving to less expensive office space, and that he was not 'running from the law'.

He told Associated Press in a phone interview: 'Since when in this country do you put people in jail for having debt?

'The point is, I had some financial struggles, which I regret. And I am working hard right now to pay the debts I owe.'

Steinberg said his financial troubles stemmed in part from his divorce in 2006.

The Irvine Company earlier this month asked the court to require Steinberg to apply a portion of his income stream to pay the judgment, alleging process servers have been unable to directly contact him.

Brooke Brandt, an attorney for the Orange County real estate company, wrote in a December 9 court filing: 'Steinberg is a semi famous figure with huge apparent notoriety but shows signs of significant recent deterioration.

'He appears to have a phalanx of security protection around him that prevents process servers from gaining access to him unless he allows it.'

The next hearing in the case is scheduled for February 6.

Steinberg is considered the first super agent in sports, having also represented such NFL stars as Warren Moon and Ben Roethlisberger.

He began his career in 1975 and was able to secure huge signing bonuses for some of football's biggest stars.
