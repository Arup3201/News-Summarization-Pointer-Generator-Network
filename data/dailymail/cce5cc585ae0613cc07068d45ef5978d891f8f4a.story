The company that runs Britain's train network today announced plans to invest £37.5billion on upgrading and expanding the country's railways.

Network Rail intends to provide 170,000 extra seats for commuters at peak times by 2019.

But with 225million more passengers expected to be travelling by that time, the firm said it would not make any attempt to crack down on trains running late.

And there have been warnings that the plan will require a massive new injection of taxpayer funding and lead to even more inflation-busting fare hikes.

Expansion: New plans to upgrade Britain's train systems have been announced by Network Rail

The NR plans come at a time of passenger fury at the 4.2 per cent rise in the average price of season tickets which took effect this month, as public anger has grown at the lavish salaries and bonuses enjoyed by train bosses.

The organisation's chief executive warned that the industry had entered 'the era of trade-offs' as it faced pressure to cut costs, and said fares may have to rise again to pay the bill for the latest expansion.

'Increasingly we have to balance the need to build more infrastructure, run trains on time and cut costs, and in many areas choices will need to be made,' Sir David Higgins said.

The NR plans - which must be approved by the Office of Rail Regulation to take effect - cover the period 2014-19.

They envisage 225million more passengers per year travelling and 355,000 more trains in service - the highest numbers ever.

20 per cent extra morning peak seats into central London will be provided, along with 32 per cent more into large regional cities in England and Wales.

Tight squeeze: NR hopes to introduce 170,000 extra seats on the morning commute

700 more trains a day will link key northern cities, with a 10-minute reduction in journey time between Manchester and Leeds.

Carbon dioxide emissions per passenger will be reduced by 37 per cent, while the network of more than 800 signal boxes is intended to be streamlined into just 14 major operations centres.

Overall, NR hopes to reduce the cost of running Britain's railways by 18 per cent, and cut annual public subsidy to between £2.6billion and £2.9billion in 2019 - down from £4.5billion in 2009 and £7billion in 2004.

Projects include various electrification schemes, including the Great Western and Midland Main Lines, station improvements at Birmingham and Reading, and reopening 31 miles of railways in Scotland closed under the Beeching cuts of 50 years ago.

Compromise: Chief executive Sir David Higgins has warned a funding squeeze will lead to cutbacks

While the company has failed to meet its current target of 92.5 per cent punctuality for the current period, it insists that the goal will be achieved by the end of 2019.

But even with extra trains and seats this will 'not be enough' on the busy West Coast Main Line, according to NR, which insists the added capacity of the London to Birmingham high-speed rail line is 'essential'.

Sir David said: 'One million more trains run every year than 10 years ago, more passengers arrive on time than ever before, our safety record is one of the best in Europe and, despite the daily challenges we face, customer satisfaction is at record levels.

'Successive governments have made this possible by looking beyond the short term and recognising the critical importance of the railway to Britain's future.'

Bob Crow, general secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said: 'While we support any plans to expand and invest in Britain's railways, you cannot seriously expect to safely increase capacity while at the same time the Government is looking to axe key frontline staff on trains, track and stations.'

'If the Government press on with the jobs cuts plans, they will simply be cramming more and more people into an overcrowded and unreliable service where safety is compromised and the profits of the private train operators are prioritised. That is simply a recipe for disaster.'

Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) chief executive Richard Price said: 'Ministers have shown huge faith in what the railways can add to Britain's society and economy, committing to around £20 billion-worth of public money at a time when there is little money to go around.

'Key to maintaining rail's success will be openly justifying this significant commitment of public money. Taxpayers significantly fund the railways, and have every right see where this money is being spent.'

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, warned ministers against big annual fare hikes to pay for rail expansion.

He said: 'We obviously back rail investment to improve the service but passengers have already suffered enough pain with a decade of annual inflation-plus fare increases.

'They should not now be expected to face another six years of even higher fares.'
