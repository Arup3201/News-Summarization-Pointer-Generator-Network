Venus Williams has pulled out of the U.S. Open after revealing she is suffering from Sjogren's syndrome - an auto-immune disease which affects production of tears and saliva and causes joint pain.

The seven-time Grand Slam winner had cruised through her first round match in New York on Monday but dramatically withdrew from the tournament yesterday after revealing she had been diagnosed with the condition.

Williams, 31 - who had previously cited a virus in withdrawing from hard court tournaments before the U.S. Open - had been due to face 22nd seed Sabine Lisicki in the second round.

But the two-time U.S. Open champion is now set for an indefinite break from the game after telling how she is suffering from the rheumatic illness.

Sjogren's syndrome affects the body's moisture-producing glands, and in severe cases can lead to arthritis and joint pain.

The condition is thought to affect as many as 4 million people in the U.S., the vast majority of whom are women.

There is currently no known cure for the condition.

Sjögren's syndrome was first described in 1933 by Swedish eye specialist Henrik Sjögren (above).

The condition causes antibodies to 
attack the body's moisture-producing glands, leading to dryness on the 
body due to lack of secretion.

The illness most commonly affects the
eyes, mouth, salivary glands, lungs, kidneys, skin and nervous system 
but all organs of the body can be affected.

In rare cases, complications from 
Sjogren's syndrome can cause salivary gland infections, kidney problems,
ulcers or pancreatitis.

Williams had said after her first round victory over Vesna Dolonts on Monday: 'No one is more in one-match-at-a-time mode than me now at this tournament. It will just be one match at a time, for sure.'

The American said yesterday in a statement: 'I'm really disappointed to have to withdraw from this year's US Open.

'I have been recently diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an auto-immune disease which is an ongoing medical condition that affects my energy level and causes fatigue and joint pain.

'I enjoyed playing my first match here and wish I could continue but right now I am unable to.

'I am thankful I finally have a diagnosis and am now focused on getting better and returning to the court soon.'

Dr Simon Bowman, spokesperson for Arthritis Research UK, said constantly fighting fatigue caused by Sjogren's Syndrome would affect Venus Williams' training and ability to compete at the top.

He said: 'At 31 Venus is relatively young to be diagnosed with this condition, typically affecting women over the age of 40. 

'She would need to get the condition under control before she can re-evaluate her career, but there are effective treatments available.

'It is too early to say whether this will be the end of her career and whether she is likely to compete at such a high level of tennis again, as constantly fighting fatigue will have an impact on any training regimes.'

The former champion's agent, Carlos Fleming, said: 'All of us came with the full expectation she'd be playing today. She was geared up to play her match.

'I just hope she's OK, and I hope she's healthy and going to be fine.'Despite her previous record at the tournament and Grand Slam titles,

Williams had gone into the U.S Open unseeded after falling to 36th in the world rankings.

She reached the semi-finals at the 
last year's tournament, but has only played 11 matches since and was 
knocked out in the fourth round of Wimbledon this summer.

Venus's sister Serena, herself a 13-time Grand Slam winner, is scheduled to play her second round match on Thursday.

On
Monday, Venus Williams was asked about the illness that caused her to 
skip tournaments this summer. She said that night that her ailment had 
been diagnosed, but wouldn't say what it was.

Williams
had said: 'It was just energy-sucking, and I just couldn't play pro 
tennis. It was disappointing, because I had huge plans for this summer, 
of course, to improve my ranking.

'To
miss out on all those points was definitely devastating. Just to miss 
so much time off tour was just disheartening. But I'm just really 
excited to be back.'
