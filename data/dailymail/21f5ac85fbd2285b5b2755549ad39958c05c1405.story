Nike's groundbreaking promotional World Cup video featuring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Neymar didn't do their top ambassadors much good at the tournament proper.

The animated short sees football superstars including David Luiz, Franck Ribery, Andres Iniesta and Zlatan Ibrahimovic join forces against 'the clones' as part of the sportswear company's 'riskeverything' campaign.

However, while football's greatest players overcame their adversaries in the five-minute animated film entitled 'The Last Game', all except US goalkeeper Tim Howard didn't fare so well when faced with the reality of the tournament.

Curse of Nike: Seven of the eight stars featured in groundbreaking video had World Cups to forget

1. David Luiz

The former Chelsea defender scored a wordly of a free-kick to setlle the quarter-final game against Colombia but his typically cavalier defending was partly blamed for Brazil's 7-1 humiliation at the hands of the Germans.

2. Andres Iniesta

The Barcelona playmaker was part of the Spain team that sounded the death knell for tiki-taka when the reigning champions crashed out after only two games following a 5-1 hammering by Holland and lacklustre defeat to Chile.

3. Neymar

Perhaps the saddest moment at the World Cup came after Brazil's poster had inspired an average side towards the semi-finals only for a late, robust challenge by Colombia's Juan Zuniga to rule him out for the rest of the tournament with a broken vertebrae.

Back to square one: Neymar was ruled out of the tournament after breaking a vertebrae... the rest is history

4. Cristiano Ronaldo

The
 preening Portuguese was beset by niggling injuries ahead of the 
tournament and failed to inspire his side past Germany and the US in the
 group stages, before scoring his only goal against Ghana. To make 
matters worse, his arch nemesis Lionel Messi has reached the final.

The shame! Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't inspire Portugal... while arch rival Lionel Messi reached the final

5. Tim Howard

There
 is always an exception to the rule and the US keeper's heroics, 
especially in a thrilling extra-time defeat to Belgium raised his stock 
to the extent that he received a personal call from President Barrack 
Obama amid cries to have a Washington airport named after him.

Super saver: Tim Howard was the exception with his goalkeeping heroics before being edged out by Belgium

6. Franck Ribery

The curse of Nike fell on the France playmaker before the tournament had even started when the Bayern Munich star was forced to miss the greatest show on earth after injuring his lower back in training. France rallied without him before failing to turn up against the Germans.

7. Wayne Rooney

England's
 so-called talisman may have scored his first and only goal at the World
 Cup but it was another tournament that failed to live up to 
expectations while there were even calls for the Manchester United 
striker to be dropped. And, that was before he lost his luggage.

Another one bites the dust: Wayne Rooney scored his first and only World Cup goal, but that was about it

8. Zlatan Ibrahimovic

The PSG frontman was forced to claim that the tournament wouldn't be the same without him after Sweden were beaten by a Ronaldo-inspired Portugal in a qualifying play-off game that saw him spend his summer on holiday instead of Brazil.
