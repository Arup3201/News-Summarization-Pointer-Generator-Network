A father-of-two died from bowel cancer seven years after his GP failed to spot the signs of the disease.

David Mallaby died in 2012, seven years after first visiting his doctor complaining of symptoms indicative of the early stages of bowel cancer.

His wife Joanne and two teenage children, Lucy and Oliver, have now been awarded a six-figure payout at the High Court.

Despite Mr Mallaby telling his GP his father had been diagnosed with bowel cancer at the age of 45, he was not referred for further tests. 

Those tests, medical experts say, would have detected a benign polyp - a growth in the bowel - and Mr Mallaby would have made a full recovery.

David Mallaby, pictured with his children Oliver and Lucy, died in March 2012 having been diagnosed with bowel cancer. His diagnosis came six years after he first visited his GP complaining of the symptoms 

The 44-year-old told his GP during his first visit that his father had died of the disease aged 45. But he was not referred for further tests, which medical experts say would have detected a benign polyp - a growth in the bowel - which later turned into the cancer, and saved his life

The 44-year-old, who was just 44 when he died in March 2012, first visited the doctor in January 2005.

But he was sent home having been told his symptoms were most likely just an anal fissure - a tear or cut which bleeds.

The father-of-two, from Worksop in South Yorkshire, was told to return if his symptoms became worse. 

Six years later, in 2011, the cancer was detected but by that stage Mr Mallaby's condition was terminal.

He died a few months later from carcinomatosis - cancer that has spread throughout the body.

Medical experts told a High Court hearing had Mr Mallaby been investigated earlier, and treated for a benign polyp - growths on the lining of the bowel that can turn into cancer - he would have made a full recovery.

The High Court awarded Mr Mallaby's family a six-figure undisclosed sum after his GP, Dr Richard Davey admitted liability

Mr Justice Hickinbottom, who approved the settlement, said it was 'in the best interests of the children and family as a whole'.

He said he could see how much 'he meant to his family and how much they miss him and continue to miss him'. 

He told the court: 'The settlement of this claim is not the most important step for Mrs Mallaby and Lucy and Oliver in coming to terms with that.

'The conclusion of the claim will allow them to concentrate on more important things.'  

The undisclosed damages will be paid by the family's former GP, Dr Richard Davey, who admitted negligence.   

Solicitor Tom Cook, for the family, said after the hearing that Mr Mallaby's widow and children hope their experience will give other people 'who feels that their GP is not taking possible cancer symptoms seriously, the confidence to ask to be referred for a second opinion'.

Mr Cook added: 'Sadly as medical negligence lawyers we see too many cases where cancer diagnoses are not made promptly and lives are lost needlessly.' 

Dr Davey, of The Village Surgery in Carlton, Worksop, was represented by his medical defence union.

Dr Davey and partners at Larwood and Village Surgeries told MailOnline: 'This was a tragic case for all those concerned and Dr Davey and his GP Partners would like to express their sincere sympathy to all those that, not only loved Mr Mallaby, but whose lives he has touched in some way.

'Although our aim is to always provide the best possible care to our patients, we know that occasionally things may not go as we had hoped. 

'This was the case with Mr Mallaby and the consequences were devastating and life-changing for all those involved.

'We will continue to strive to deliver a high standard of care and make any improvements necessary to achieve this.'
