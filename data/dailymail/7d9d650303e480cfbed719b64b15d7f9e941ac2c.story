The White House has two words for those who want President Barack Obama to deport Justin Bieber: No comment.

It looks like Justin Bieber won't be going back to Canada any time soon.

Despite nearly 275,000 non-Beliebers who signed an Internet petition calling the Canadian-born teen idol reckless and asking Obama to revoke his green card, The White House says it's sorry to disappoint, but it won't be commenting.

Making a surprise appearance: Justin turned up unannounced to perform with Chance The Rapper at the Coachella music festival in Indio, California, last weekend

Some Americans don't like him: Justin Bieber, seen here shooting a music
 video in Panama, was the subject of a petition to see him be deported back to Canada

More than quarter of a million people 
signed the petition which is far more than required to merit an official
 response through the White House's 'We the People' program.

The government promises to review a 
petition once it receives more than 100,000 signatures in 30 days. The 
Baby singer got that amount in only six days.

The White House is citing a caveat that allows it to decline to address certain petitions.

Playing it safe, President Obama's administration said: 'Sorry to disappoint, but we won’t be commenting on this one,'

Haven't they enough on their plate?: The White House promises to review all petitions that receive 100,000 signatures in a month - Bieber got that amount in SIX days

But the 
politicos couldn't resist getting one message across, adding: 'We’ll 
leave it to others to comment on Mr. Bieber’s case, but we’re 
glad you care about immigration issues. Because our current system is 
broken.

'Too many employers game the system by hiring undocumented 
workers, and 11 million people are living in the shadows.'

They  argue that an immigration overhaul could shrink deficits by nearly $1 
trillion over two decades.

The White House says that's equivalent to 12.5 billion concert tickets — or 100 billion copies of Bieber's debut album.

The
 petition, titled 'Deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card,' was 
launched the same day news broke about the Bieb's brush with the law.

Just six days later, the petition topped 100,000 signatures, the threshold needed for a White House response.

In trouble: Justin Bieber was photographed for the records by Miami Beach Police after his arrest for alleged DUI, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license on January 23

It's official: The We The People page on the White House's website had 273,968 signatures as of Saturday morning

The petition starts, 'We the people 
of the United States … would like to see the dangerous, destructive, and
 drug abusing Justin Bieber deported and his green card revoked.'

It also states: 'He is not only threatening the safety of our people, but he is also a terrible influence on our nation’s youth.

'We the people would like to remove Justin Bieber from our society.'

Then 19, the troubled star appeared glassy-eyed when he was booked at Miami-Dade County Jail at around 
4.30am. Toxicology reports revealed he was still under the influence 
of marijuana and also had Xanax in his system.

The White House response took far longer than normal as requests from such petitions are usually answered in 30 days.

The
 Never Say Never hitmaker pleaded not guilty to charges of DUI, 
resisting arrest and driving without a valid license. His trial is due 
to begin on May 5 in Florida.

Bieber's criminal defense attorney has denied that prosecutors have offered a plea deal in the case.

Roy
 Black - who defended William Kennedy Smith, Rush Limbaugh and Joe 
Francis among others, says that no plea deal was offered 
and his legal team is 'vigorously preparing' for the upcoming trial.

Is he a Belieber?: President Obama - who welcomed the singer to his home in 2010 - is not commenting

In 2012 a petition was filed to have 
Piers Morgan deported but it didn't work. He is still living in Beverly 
Hills with his family.

Despite Bieber's recent offenses that included a DUI, resisting arresting and driving on an expired license, he would have had to have done something much more severe, like murder, to get kicked out of the US.

It was highly unlikely that the petition would eve have amounted to anything more than a bit of teasing.

Bieber has already performed for Obama's two daughters Natasha and Malia - who are big fans of the star - at the White House in 2010.

However, it's fair to say that Bieber has done nothing to help his public image since his run-in with the police in Florida.

Not the TV attention he wanted: The pop star, then 19, appeared in a Miami court via closed circuit TV as the judge set bail at $2,500

So much has changed in five years: The star in 2014 (left) and in 2009 (right)

After holing up in a Miami rental with his father Jeremy Bieber, aged 38, and model Chantel Jeffries, aged 21, he went to Panama with his entourage to film a music video on the beach.

His manager Scooter Braun as well as his mentor Usher and mother Pattie Mallette had visited the star in the tropical location urging him to get help.
