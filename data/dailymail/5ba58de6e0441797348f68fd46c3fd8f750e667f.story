Niki Lauda has only one message for Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg before their world-championship decider in Abu Dhabi — race any way you like.

The Mercedes team chairman drew on all his experience as a triple world champion to tell Sportsmail: ‘I will give them no orders whatsoever. Only the two guys can figure out how best to proceed. It is sensible to leave them to it.’

Hamilton and Rosberg clashed at Spa in August when the Briton refused to yield to his former karting partner’s gung-ho move early in the race.

Rosberg — harshly in the opinion of most observers — was publicly reprimanded by the team for his part in what the stewards deemed to be no more than a ‘racing incident’.

‘We told them after Spa not to crash into one another, and nothing bad has happened since,’ said Lauda.

‘But this is the final race. Lewis leads by 17 points. They both want the world championship so interference from me would make no sense. They both know the possible danger to their own car if they get involved with each other. That is all they need to know.’

One issue that is scheduled for discussion within 48 hours of Sunday’s finish is Hamilton’s contract. He is signed to Mercedes for next year but no further.

‘I have heard stories that Lewis wanted to sign for Ferrari, but that is absolutely wrong,’ said Lauda. ‘Toto (Wolff, who is in day-to-day charge of Mercedes) and I have a very good relationship with Lewis.

‘Lewis requested we leave the contract talk until the season was over. He wanted to concentrate on his racing. We had exactly the same opinion. He will stay regardless of whether he wins or loses on Sunday.’

But who will deal with the contract minutiae for Hamilton is unclear since his recent split from XIX, Simon Fuller’s management stable. Yet he remains on good terms with Fuller and has retained a few of the mogul’s staff — at least until he decides who he wants to represent him in future. 

Hamilton’s long-time lawyer Sue Thackeray, seen as a power behind the throne, will no doubt have an important role but his father, Anthony, remains another significant influence.

How does Lauda evaluate his two drivers? 

‘From a speed point of view they are the same. Only thousandths of seconds can separate them. Nico is hard-working. He looks at every detail and sorts everything out. Lewis is a very aggressive talent. He can overtake like nobody else. 

'The reason they are so successful is that they develop the car in the same direction. To me they are both world champions, but after Abu Dhabi only one of them will be.’

McLaren announced last night they will not decide until ‘a date no earlier than December 1’ which driver to pair with Fernando Alonso next season. 

That means Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen are possibly in a shoot-out in Abu Dhabi, despite chairman Ron Dennis having promised a decision before the end of the season and sources categorically saying that Magnussen would get the seat.
