France have been impressive going forward, but itâ€™s their strength in midfield that gives them a solid platform from which to attack.

Yohan Cabaye pulls the strings in the middle with Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi providing energy either side of him.

Antoine Griezmann gives them balance alongside Karim Benzema up front, but if the French win the midfield battle, they have a huge chance to win against Germany in Friday's World Cup quarter-final.

Thomas Muller has an incredible World Cup scoring record, but sometimes he needs to stay closer to goal.

He moves from the centre to create space, which can lead to goals, but he is better off in the middle.

There's something not quite right with Germany.

They need to stop indulging Philipp Lahm in the middle and use him in his best position as a full back.

Let Bastian Schweinsteiger boss the midfield because nobody is dominating the middle. Mesut Ozil also needs to be far more ruthless in his game.
