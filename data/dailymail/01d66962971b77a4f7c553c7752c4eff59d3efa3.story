Six Britons have been arrested in India after their ship sailed into the country’s waters allegedly carrying a huge cache of illegal weapons.

The men – some of whom are believed to be ex-SAS – were among the crew of MV Seaman Guard Ohio which Indian officials branded a ‘floating armoury’.

Police said they seized 35 assault rifles and nearly 5,700 rounds of ammunition from guards on the U.S.-owned vessel.

The Indian coast guard stopped the ship, which belongs to security firm AdvanFort, on Saturday and detained 33 crew members.

Detained: Indian police escort foreign crew members off a police bus after they were detained on a ship off the Indian coast on October 12

Held: Indian police arrested and questioned 33 people aboard a ship operated by a US anti-piracy firm for carrying guns and ammunition in Indian waters without proper permits, reports said

AdvanFort claims that the ship has been 
supporting an anti-piracy initiative in Asia but Indian authorities say 
that they found weapons that had not been properly declared.

The company had said that Indian authorities had permitted the ship to enter Indian waters to refuel and to avoid a cyclone that hit the south east of the country last week.

But crew members - from India, Ukraine, Estonia as well as six from Britain - were taken to a police station close to Tuticorin.

Two other crew members were allowed to stay onboard the vessel, which has been docked in Tamil Nadu state.

The British High Commission in Delhi say that they have spoken to the British crew members and Indian authorities but have yet to determine why the men have been detained.

The U.S embassy has declined to comment, according to the BBC.

Guards: AdvanFort have said that some of the men onboard the Sierra-Leone registered MV Seaman Guard Ohio are privately contracted security guards hired to provide protection against piracy

AdvanFort have said that some of the men onboard the Sierra-Leone registered MV Seaman Guard Ohio are privately contracted security guards hired to provide protection against piracy - which is a threat to ships in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea.

The group are said to have had rifles, ammunition, medical kit and protective equipment onboard, which the firm claims is all properly registered.

Various agencies, including the Coast Guard and the Intelligence Bureau, have reportedly interrogated the ship's crew.

A report was subsequently submitted to the Ministries of Defence and External Affairs.

According to reports in India, the ship had no log book to account for the weapons on board and none of the men had Indian visas stamped on their passports.
