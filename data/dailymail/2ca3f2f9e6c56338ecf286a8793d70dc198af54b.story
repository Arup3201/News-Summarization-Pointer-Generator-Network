She claimed that she was powerless as John F Kennedy took advantage of her.

But now the former White House intern who had an 18-month affair with the ex-president has revealed that she actually wanted to have sex with him.

Mimi Alford said that when Mr Kennedy took her virginity in his wife’s bed in the summer of 1962 she was ‘willing to do it.'

Broken lips: Mimi Alford kept her secret affair with the former U.S. president safe for years before deciding to write a tell-all book about their time together

At the White House swimming pool, JFK asked Mimi (pictured): 'Mind if I join you?' She described him as 'remarkably fit - flat stomach, toned arms - for a 45-year-old man. After sliding into the pool, he floated up to me'

Far from being repulsed by his advances, the former church worker also admitted that she found him ‘unbelievably handsome’.

Miss Alford’s disclosure undercuts her suggestion that Mr Kennedy took advantage of her and used her for sex during their initial liaison.

Extracts from her memoir have detailed how she was shocked when on her fifth day as a White House press aide he led her away from co-workers who were having cocktails down the hall to his wife’s bedroom where they had sex for the first time.

Aged 19 at the time, she writes that ‘short of screaming’ there was nothing she could do to get Mr Kennedy off her.

But in an interview with NBC, Miss Alford said that she actually meant ‘overpowered in the sense that he was the president.'

Speaking to Today she said: ‘He was this unbelievably handsome man who was 45-years-old.

‘Not
 overpowered physically as in somebody grabbed me and made me do 
something that I wasn't really willing to do, because I really think I 
was willing to do it.'

Miss Alford added that the first time she met the President the day before at the White House pool, during which time he eyed her up, felt perfectly normal too.

She said: ‘It really didn’t feel unnatural because everybody was friendly because everybody went back to work afterwards.’

'Even in our most intimate moments, I called him Mr President. To do otherwise would have seemed inappropriate'

Comfortable: Miss Alford says that her exclusive meetings with the president and his most-trusted staff members felt natural because of how friendly and seemingly open they were

Miss Alford was first ‘outed’ in 2003 in a biography of Mr Kennedy but she has kept quiet until now.

Asked why she now decided to write her memoirs, she said: ‘Most mornings I thought: ‘I don’t want to get up and write this book’.

‘Then I thought: ‘Why keep a secret? Why keep silent about something? You do something because you think it’s keeping you safe, but in fact it’s deadly.'

In the book, ‘Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath,' Miss Alford writes how she went from being a debutante from a prominent New Jersey family to a White House press aide - and into the president’s bed.

Handsome: She called him unbelievably handsome helping advance her enthusiasm as a White House press aide to a usual member of his entourage and then, a partner in his bed

Her lurid claims include allegations that he once made her inhale a sex drug at a debauched party at Bing Crosby’s desert ranch.

'The president asked me if I wanted to try the drug, which stimulated the heart but also purportedly enhanced sex.

'I
 said no, but he just went ahead and popped the capsule and held it 
under my nose. He didn’t try it himself. This was a new sensation, and 
it frightened me. I panicked and ran crying from the room,' she writes in her autobiography.

On another occasion he coerced her into performing a sex act on an aide while he looked on.

When she thought she was pregnant that same aide arranged for her to see an abortion doctor, even though abortion was illegal at the time.

Encounters: She found the president unbelievably handsome, in her words, and was both happy and comfortable when she met staff for a swim in the White House pool and he showed up, giving her a look up and down

It turned out to be a false alarm.

Miss Alford, now a 69-year-old grandmother living in New York, also writes in her autobiography that through their affair she never called Mr Kennedy by his first name ‘Jack’ and always called him ‘Mr President,' even when they were in bed together.

Miss Alford, who ironically went to the 
same Miss Porter's school as JFK's wife Jackie, described Kennedy as 
'playful', the sex as 'varied and fun' and said he could be 'seductive 
and playful'.

She said they 
spent a lot of time 'taking baths' and that if they spent the night 
together, she would wear his own soft-blue cotton nightshirts.

But
 she also revealed complications in the relationship, saying they never 
kissed, and that she was often subjected to a 'waiting game' where she 
was told to stay in her hotel until he called for her.

In a different direction for their affairs, Miss Alford also writes of the president asking her to
 'take care' of his friend, staff member Dave Powers, who 'looked a little tense' in his description while 
they were swimming in the White House pool.

Published: Miss Alford's new book, Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath, provides a never-before told story of life in the White House with the president as his mistress

'It
 was a dare, but I knew exactly what he meant. This was a challenge to 
give Dave Powers oral sex. I don’t think the president thought I’d do 
it, but I’m ashamed to say that I did... The president silently 
watched,' she wrote.

During the October 1962 Cuban Missile 
Crisis, where the U.S. and USSR had a nuclear stand-off, he reportedly 
told her that: 'I’d rather my children red than dead.'

In another, more personal moment when her lover reached out to her following the death of his infant son 
Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, she wrote of their time together seated on a White House balcony while he quietly wept.

She wrote: 'I had never seen real 
grief in my relatively short life. He invited me upstairs, and we sat 
outside on the balcony in the soft summer evening air. There was a stack
 of condolence letters on the floor next to his chair, and he picked 
each one up and read it aloud to me... Occasionally, tears rolling down 
his cheeks, he would write something on one of the letters, probably 
notes for a reply. But mostly he just read them and cried. I did, too.'

Miss Alford
 said she saw President Kennedy for the final time at The Carlyle hotel 
in Manhattan on November 15, 1963, just a week before his assassination 
in Dallas.

At this point she was due to be married to her college sweetheart, Tony Fahnestock.

'He
 took me in his arms for a long embrace and said, 'I wish you were 
coming with me to Texas.' And then he added, 'I'll call you when I get 
back.' I was overcome with sudden sadness. 'Remember, Mr President, I’m 
getting married.'

''I know that,' he said, and shrugged. 'But I’ll call you anyway.''
