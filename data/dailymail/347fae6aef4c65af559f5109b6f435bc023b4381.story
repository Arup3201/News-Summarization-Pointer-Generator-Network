Making an impression: The average graduate worker spends a total of five hours every week making coffee and tea for their colleagues

John Major, Theo Paphitis and Chris Moyles all started their successful careers from the humble beginnings of doing the office tea rounds.

But those now entering the world of work spend up to an hour every day getting coffee and tea for their superiors, new research has revealed.

A study showed that the average graduate worker spends a total of five hours every week making coffee and tea for their colleagues.

Graduates starting out spend around 258 hours per year – 12 per cent of their time at work - making hot drinks for other members of staff.

And employees in the north have a rougher deal, with graduates in Yorkshire dedicating more than seven hours a week to getting drinks – amounting to nearly one working day per week.

But in Scotland graduates spent almost half as long – around three hours each week - fetching teas in the workplace.

The survey showed men spent longer than women making hot beverages.

But it was unclear whether they did more rounds or simply took longer ferrying drinks than their female colleagues.

When not making tea, research by Allianz Insurance revealed graduates are often expected to perform administrative duties such as photocopying and diary keeping.

Each year graduates spend 334 hours scanning and printing documents and 346 hours on tasks like taking minutes in meetings.

Amanda Haig, of Allianz Insurance, said a positive attitude is important for getting ahead in the workplace but that employers should not overlook the abilities of their graduate members of staff.

She said: ‘It’s important that graduates are given opportunities that stretch them as individuals but getting along with colleagues and showing a willingness to get stuck in can see graduates go far.’
