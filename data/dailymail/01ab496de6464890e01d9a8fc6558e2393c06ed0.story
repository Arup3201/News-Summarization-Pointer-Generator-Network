The Sussex mansion where Oscar-winning actor George Sanders is rumored to have spent the night with Marilyn Monroe could be yours for £1million.

Rothbury House is the former home of notorious ladies' man Mr Sanders, the actor who voiced 'Shere Khan' in the Jungle Book.

The Art Deco home in Storrington, West Sussex, was frequented by some of the English actor's Hollywood co-stars including Elizabeth Taylor.

A mansion used a party venue by Hollywood stars including Marilyn Monroe and Sir Laurence Olivier has been put up for sale for £1million

Once a glamorous location for the actor's legendary parties the house played host to the likes of Bing Crosby, Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenyan President Jomo Kenyatta.

Mr Sanders was a legendary playboy and was married four times.

In 1949 he married his most famous wife Zsa Zsa Gabor, but the couple divorced in 1954. In 1967 he married her older sister Magda but that marriage only lasted six weeks.

But possibly the most intriguing secret of Rothbury House, is the night that Marilyn Monroe came to stay.

The actor won an Academy Award for his role in All About Eve which also starred Miss Monroe.

And
when she was in Britain to film The Princess And The Showgirl, she 
famously stayed the night at Rothbury House, prompting rumours of a 
romance.

During the stay the pair left other 
diners aghast when they enjoyed a meal at nearby Manleys restaurant, 
before returning to the star's house.

Once called  'The man who sneered his way to stardom' Mr Sanders enjoyed a 40 year acting career before his suicide in 1972.

The star, who was born in Russia to British parents, was said to enjoy playing the roles of kings and rulers.

He appeared alongside the likes of Lucille Ball, Angela Lansbury, Yul Brynner and his former Brighton College alumni Sir Laurence Olivier.

He has two stars on the Hollywood walk of fame, one in recognition for his work in films, and the other to salute his television performances.

His final film appearance was in the 1972 British horror Psychomania in the same year he died.

Six floor Rothbury house boasts a master suite, four bedrooms, a sauna, gym and cinema and has been on the market for two months.

After Mr Sanders' death the house has had several owners, and was in the spotlight again in 1976 when it was raided by police on suspicion of being used for blue movie shoots.

Current owner Amanda Munday told the Brighton Argus: 'It's a real party place and we have had lots of parties and now I think it probably needs someone of a artistic mind to take it on.'
