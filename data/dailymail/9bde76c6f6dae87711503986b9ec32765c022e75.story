Former referee and Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll believes refereeing is at the worst level he can remember

The body which represents Premier League refs has hit back following stinging critcism from former referees' boss Keith Hackett.

Hackett has called for his successor Mike Riley to be removed from his position with Professional Games Match Officials Ltd (PGMOL) and labelled the current crop of officials as the 'worst that we have seen', citing 'over 20 major errors' during the Christmas period.

The 70-year-old said Mike Jones, Andre Marriner, Chris Foy and Lee Mason should be stood down at the end of the season and Lee Probert removed from his position should he fail a fitness test.

PGMOL would not respond directly but released statistics showing standards had improved in every available measure in the five years since Hackett left the organisation. These include accuracy on major decisions, up to 95 per cent from 94.1 per cent, on decisions in the penalty box (98 per cent) and offsides, 99 per cent compared to 92 per cent five years ago when Riley took over.

Hackett's attack was made on his website, which also sells refereeing kits and equipment and offers training courses.

The PGMOL is standing firm, however, confident it has taken the right path since Hackett's departure and that it is backed up by all the statistics. There are usually periods in every season where a series of controversial decisions puts the spotlight on to officials, and has led to football's lawmakers to begin to consider video replays.

That will be debated at the International FA Board at its next meeting in Belfast on February 28, though any final decision is likely to be a couple of years away with trials being needed first.

PGMOL's latest figures show referees' fitness has improved, especially in terms of sprints.

MIKE JONES

Awarded Liverpool two controversial penalties for handball - both of which were scored - against Leicester City at Anfield.

LEE MASON

Failed to show Stoke forward Jon Walters a straight red card after he brought down Everton's Leighton Baines as his side's last man. Walters only received a booking.

ANDRE MARRINER

Only gave Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala a yellow card despite a flying kick into the back of Everton's Samuel Eto'o.

CHRIS FOY

Gave Tottenham's Kyle Naughton a straight red card for handball against West Ham, despite no clear angle showing that Kevin Nolan's shot was going on target.

Writing on his 'You are the ref' blog, Hackett has called for wide-ranging action to change PGMOL, with the first course of action to 'dispense with the services of the current PGMOL General Manager'. 

'One thing is certain: Professional Game Match Officials Limited cannot continue without a fundamental review of its operations,' he wrote.

'The PGMOL is failing in its aim to DELIVER EXCELLENCE ON THE FIELD.'

And Hackett agrees with former referee Graham Poll's scathing opinion that performances have been reached a new low.

'This season we have all witnessed many disastrous performances and big game-changing errors,' Hackett added. 'I share the view of one former top referee that the current group of professional referees is the worst that we have seen.

'The latest big game decision error was the stupid dismissal of Wayne Routledge of Swansea City who himself was on the receiving end of a reckless challenge.

'It is unbelievable that a so-called top referee should make such a mistake.

'It is my view that the board of the PGMOL should return to its original constitution with the chief executives of The FA, The Football League and Premier League reviewing the current PGMOL operation.'

Lee Mason, pictured booking Leicester's Jamie Vardy, has also come in for criticism from Hackett

Routledge's red card, which was shown by Anthony Taylor, was later overturned by the Football Association and, while Taylor was not on Hackett's list for the chop, he was scathing in his assessment of Riley.

'I am criticising very strongly,' he told BBC Sport. 'If the guy is at the bottom of the league then his job is at risk. At this moment in time he (Riley) is more than bottom.

'I am seeing a regression. The performances of the referees are not acceptable. He must carry the responsibility.'

He added: 'Ultimately, at the end of the day, I don't think they're bad referees, I just think they need some leadership and guidance and help at this stage to improve performances on the field of play.'
