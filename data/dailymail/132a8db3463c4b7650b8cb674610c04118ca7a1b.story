Missing: Thiago Silva will be suspended for Brazil's World Cup semi-final against Germany

A FIFA statement said: 'The disciplinary committee... cannot consider the matter given the fact that there is no legal basis entitling it to grant such request.'

The CBF had also pushed for action against Zuniga but this was rejected by FIFA's disciplinary committee who said the referee had seen the incident.

FIFA added: 'After an analysis of the matter and the extensive submission and documentation received from the CBF, the chairman came to the conclusion that the FIFA disciplinary committee cannot consider this matter in light of the conditions outlined in the FIFA disciplinary code... to be able to intervene in such a situation.'
