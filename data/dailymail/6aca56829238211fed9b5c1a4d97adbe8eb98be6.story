With star summer signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas still on a beach after the World Cup, it was left to Chelsea’s young charges to take care of their first pre-season friendly at Wycombe.

Aided by stalwarts John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic, the young Blues side stormed to a 5-0 win with many of the younger charges impressing.

Here, Sportsmail looks at some of the starlets on display Jose Mourinho may be running the rule over to supplement his first-team set-up.

Watchful eye: The performances of some of Chelsea's youngsters will have given Mourinho food for thought

PATRICK BAMFORD

Bamford lit up the lower leagues last season, at MK Dons in League One before spending the second half of the campaign notching up a good record at Championship side Nottingham Forest.Wearing Chelsea’s yellow No 9 shirt, Bamford started at Wycombe and broke the deadlock in the first half.

His goal showed off his main asset – a well-taken, instinctive first-time finish from Ake’s cross from the byline – everything Chelsea’s goal-shy strikers were missing last season.

Bamford’s display wasn’t limited to opening the scoring, however, as he was soon in his own penalty area saving a certain equaliser with a goal-line clearance.

The Blues are famously light up front – new signing Diego Costa excepted – with Fernando Torres continuing to disappoint and Romelu Lukaku looking for opportunities elsewhere, so it is actually possible Bamford could have some role to play in the first team this season.

However, to continue his steady development with more game-time, a Premier League loan could be the way forward. Impress there and the sky’s the limit.

KURT Zouma

Jose Mourinho splashed £12million on the French under-21 defender in January, but this was his first outing in Chelsea colours, having been loaned straight back to St. Etienne.

Zouma came on mid-way through the first half for the injured Todd Kane at right-back, not his normal position. He made attempts to offer width by bombing up Wycombe’s unguarded flank, occasionally showing a rashness of touch that match fitness will no doubt sharpen.

The 19-year-old looked far more assured once moved to centre-half next to John Terry. Showing awareness, calmness and the no-nonsense physical style that became his trademark in the French league, the defender will have impressed the travelling support.

With David Luiz out of the picture and last season’s back-up Tomas Kalas famed out on loan, Zouma now has every chance of cementing a squad place as Chelsea’s third-choice centre-half.

IZZY BROWN

Chelsea snapped up the 17-year-old from West Brom last year and the striker – a regular for England under-17s – impressed in the Blues youth academy last season.

Brown entered the fray in the second half at Adams Park, and immediately made his mark by deftly turning diminutive left-back Jay da Silva’s cross into the top corner to double Chelsea’s lead.

After John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic showed their experience by putting the game out of Wycombe’s reach, Brown completed the rout with the goal of the night – a first-time right-footed thunderbolt from outside the area.

Brown’s impressive technique and physicality should see him a success in the English game, but at just 17 perhaps a loan move beckons for his development this campaign.

JEREMIE BOGA

Chelsea took control of the game at Wycombe in the second half, with four of the five goals coming once the experienced Terry, Ivanovic and Matic came on.

However, it wasn’t those Blues stalwarts that most caught the eye. Although Brown’s two goals grabbed the headlines, 17-year-old Boga became the team’s playmaking fulcrum, with Chelsea’s attacking movement going through him.

Considered one of the brightest prospects in the Cobham academy and consistently playing above his age group, Boga won’t be troubling the first team this season but may look to cement his role as one of the key players for Chelsea’s trophy-laden under-21 side.

MARCO VAN GINKEL

The Dutch midfielder cruelly had a promising campaign last season cut short thanks to a cruciate ligament injury in the Capital One Cup at Swindon.

This his first first-team appearance since then, Van Ginkel took control of midfield in his first half role, showing the wide array of passing that impressed fans on his arrival at the club last summer.

On the fringe of the Holland national side, Van Ginkel has work to do if he is to muscle his way into the reckoning in an ever-more competitive Chelsea midfield.

Van Ginkel is capable of sitting in a central ‘two’ in Mourinho’s 4-2-3-1 formation, a position possibly not suited to the more attacking Cesc Fabregas.

If being able to be called upon to sit alongside Nemanja Matic can become a unique selling point then Van Ginkel can be a vital squad player for the Blues this season – if not a loan move beckons.
