A former New Labour health adviser will succeed the embattled head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson.

Simon Stevens is to take on the task of overhauling the health service in England following recent scandals, while budgets remain tight.

Sir David will stand down next April, after months of pressure over his role overseeing the scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire Trust where hundreds are feared to have died needlessly due to failings.

He was dubbed ‘The Man With No Shame’ 
after failing to take responsibility for the disaster, and was accused 
of presiding over a system where doctors, nurses and managers were 
afraid to speak out about poor care, and hundreds were handed gagging 
orders.

The job description for the role of NHS England’s chief executive – with a budget of nearly £100billion – said it was seeking ‘an inspirational and transformational leader’ to ‘deliver more and better quality with less’.

Mr Stevens, 47, who was Tony Blair’s health adviser in Number 10, volunteered to take a 10 per cent pay cut on Sir David’s salary from £211,000 to £189,000.

A Government source said he wanted to ‘show leadership in tough times’.

It is understood he was David Cameron’s first choice for the role, and also the preferred candidate of Professor Sir Malcolm Grant, the chairman of the five-member board of NHS England who make the final choice, although the health secretary has the right of veto.

Well-regarded in the NHS, he has 25 years’ experience of healthcare management.

He started out in hospital management before being appointed as a policy adviser to Alan Milburn while he was health secretary in 1997-2001 and then as health policy adviser to Blair in Number Ten from 2001-2004, but he is seen as non-ideological.

During his time as a New Labour adviser he helped develop their key policies to slash waiting times, expand the number of frontline staff and allow hospitals to become self-governing trusts.

For the past nine years he has worked in senior roles for UnitedHealth, a not-for-profit healthcare provider in the US. He is currently president of their Global Health division which develops private healthcare systems in other countries.

Mr Stevens said: ‘The next five years are going to be extremely challenging for the NHS, but compassionate high quality care for all is as vital as ever.

Professor Sir Malcolm Grant, chair of the NHS England board, said he is 'delighted' at Mr Steven's appointment

‘It will be a privilege to lead NHS England - at a time when the stakes have never been higher - because I believe in the NHS, and because I believe that a broad new partnership of patients, carers, staff and the public can together chart a successful future for our Health Service.’

He starts at a time of pressures on NHS budgets from an ageing population and the rising cost of managing chronic conditions.

Sir Malcolm said: ‘I am delighted that Simon will be taking on this exceptionally challenging leadership role for the NHS. He has huge experience, both national and global, and across all sectors, and is admired by healthcare professionals across the world for his commitment to the values of the NHS and to the provision of quality healthcare for all.

‘We have been through a rigorous global search, and engaged with a range of excellent candidates. I am confident that Simon Stevens is the right person to lead NHS England through the coming years, bringing new ideas and fresh energy.’
