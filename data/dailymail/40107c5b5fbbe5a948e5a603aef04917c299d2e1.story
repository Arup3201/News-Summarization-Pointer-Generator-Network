This is the incredible moment a racing driver broke a world record by hitting 257mph - in a modified Ford.

Sean Kennedy, 29, smashed the existing record for acceleration over a mile-long stretch while driving a highly-tuned Ford GT in Texas.

The daring motor sports enthusiast rocketed to an incredible 257mph in the humble car, which has been souped up with a 5.4-litre V8 engine and two massive turbo-chargers.

Fast as lightning: Racing driver Sean Kennedy hits the extreme speeds to smash the acceleration record

Numbers game: The Texan car enthusiast believes the £275,000 Ford has the potential to do even better

Mr Kennedy went from a stationary position to an astonishing 200mph by the halfway mark, before setting the new 'standing mile world' by the end of the track.

It was not even the Texan's car - with Mr Kennedy driving the Ford for local businessman Mark Heidaker.

The Ford GT was built
by Hennessey Performance, with the U.S. company saying the car's power 
was 'conservatively estimated' at around 2,000bhp - twice as much as a 
Bugatti Veyron.

But while a Veyron will set its owner back £1million, the Ford will cost a mere £275,000.

Yet despite going faster than any other car over the distance, adrenaline junkie Mr Kennedy is confident he can do even better.

Highly tuned: The car's power is 'conservatively estimated' at around 2,000bhp - twice as much as a £1m Bugatti Veyron

Designated daredevil: Mr Kennedy was driving the Hennessey Performance Ford for local businessman Mark Heidaker

Revved up: The adrenaline junkie was already doing more than 200mph at the halfway stage

Gear shift: Next, the car lovers hope to take the Ford to a eyebrow-raising 260mph using the lower gears

He said: 'I was impressed with how hard it pulled in fourth and fifth gears on that run.

'I think I can do better in the lower gears next time and we can run an even better speed.

'We want to go 260.'

The previous record on a mile-stretch was 250.1mph, set by a similarly tuned car.
