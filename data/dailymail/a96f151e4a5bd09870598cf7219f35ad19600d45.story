Viktor Troicki ruthlessly dismantled ailing Kazakh qualifier Mikhail Kukushkin 6-2 6-3 to win the Sydney International for his second career ATP title on Saturday.

The 28-year-old Serb won the last four games of the first set and was 4-1 up in the second when Kukushkin took a medical timeout to have treatment on his left thigh.

The Kazakh rallied to win the next two games for his first break of serve in the match but Troicki was just too strong and broke back before serving out the match and claiming the title with his 13th ace.

The 28-year-old Serb won in straight sets to pick up his second career ATP title victory  

Once ranked 12th in the world, Troicki is working his way back up the rankings after a doping ban that took a year out of his career. 

His first-round opponent at the Australian Open will be Jiri Vesely, who won his first ATP open title after a 6-3 6-2 victory over Frenchman Adrian Mannarino at the Auckland Open.  

A day after stunning world number 16 Kevin Anderson in the semi-finals, the big-serving 21-year-old sent down 11 aces in the 67 minute contest to become the first qualifier in more than three decades to win New Zealand's most prestigious title.

Mannarino had started the match in fine fashion by breaking his opponent's serve in the first game but the powerful Vesely broke back and grabbed a second when the Frenchman double faulted before serving out the set with a searing ace.

The second set started with a Mannarino double fault and things rarely looked up for the world number 44 afterwards with only the rain clouds gathering over Auckland looking likely to stop Vesely.

A downpour came with the Czech 5-1 up but the players were able to resume without too much delay and the world number 63 wrapped up victory with another huge ace.
