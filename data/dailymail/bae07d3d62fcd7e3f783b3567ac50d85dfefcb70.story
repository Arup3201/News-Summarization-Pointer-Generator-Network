It was the awkward moment which left Prime Minister Tony Abbott a little red-faced after calling Sunrise host David 'Kochie' Koch the wrong name on two occasions during an interview last week.

But this morning Kochie revealed on Channel Seven's breakfast program that Mr Abbott recently approached him and apologised for the error, confessing he was 'a bit hungover' from a staff Christmas party.

During the interview on December 8, Kochie grilled Mr Abbott on live television over his low approval rating and to talk about his paid parental leave plan.

But just like his interview with Karl Stefanovic on rival program Today two weeks ago, the dialogue with Kochie didn't go so well.

Tony Abbott appeared on Channel Seven's Sunrise on December 8 to face questions over his low approval rating and to talk about his paid parental leave plan

'I saw him the other night and he came up and he goes "g'day Chris" and then apologised,' Kochie said on Thursday morning.

'He said "I was a bit hung over because we had our staff Christmas party".' 

The interview last week started with Kochie quoting the new opinion poll results and saying Mr Abbott was 'now as unpopular as Julia Gillard at her lowest'.

'Well Chris, sorry David... We're not the first government that's had a rough patch in the polls. We're getting on with delivering for the Australian people,' Mr Abbott said.

As the Prime Minister listed promises and policies the Liberal government had delivered on in its first year, Kochie interrupted and told him people were actually focusing on the promises he had broken.

'The public feels like you have lied to them consistently over your first term,' Kochie told the PM.

'They didn't think they'd get a $7 co-payment or have to pay university fees… all things that you've broken since then. 

'Do you need to apologise to the public and say "Yeah I've let you down, I did lie to you, I did break a lot of promises but hey I'm going to rebuild from here?".'

After repeated questions from Kochie asking if the Prime Minister would apologise to the public, Mr Abbott slipped up on his name again.

'Well Chris, Kochie, I do not accept the accusations that you’re making. I just don’t accept them,' he said shaking his head.

'I think there are a lot of things that people have said and frankly a lot of these so called commitments were commitments other people had attributed to us post the election.'

Sunrise host Kochie repeatedly asked Mr Abbott is he was going to apologise to the public over his broken election promises

Mr Abbott had a radio interview with the ABC's Chris Uhlmann prior to Sunrise, which may explain the slip-up.  

In last week's interview on Channel Nine, Mr Abbott took aim at the Labor party saying they were trying to sabotage the government's budget and he wished they weren't 'in such a feral mood'.

Karl Stefanovic hit back by saying he was exactly the same in Opposition.

'With respect you were fairly feral in Opposition weren't you, I mean the greatest respect by that, and ... why would (Bill Shorten) do anything different when it worked for you?' Stefanovic asked.

'The reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse.

'No one is buying what you are selling, what you are laying down. That is the problem.'

The slip-up on Sunrise came a just week after Mr Abbott came under fire from Channel Nine's Karl Stefanovic
