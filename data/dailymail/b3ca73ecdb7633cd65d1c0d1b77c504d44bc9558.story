A Maryland mother and father under investigation for letting their two young children walk a mile home from the park alone have been found responsible for 'unsubstantiated' child neglect.

Danielle and Alexander Meitiv, who believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, were thrust into the national spotlight just before Christmas when police found Rafi, 10 and Dvora, six, wandering the sidewalk on their own.

The decision by Child Protective Services means that the CPS will keep a file on the Meitiv's open for at least five years but Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have said they will continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences.

Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to them.

Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'.

'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe.

However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress.

Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own.

Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves.

It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.

This seemingly arbitrary ability to place a family under investigation and rule against them has left the Meitiv's, who both work as scientists, furious.

Incensed by the ruling of the CPS, the Meitiv's have said they will continue to allow their two young children to walk unsupervised and reject any suggestions they are bad parents - claiming that giving their children independence is their right as parents.

'We don’t feel it was appropriate for an investigation to start, much less conclude that we are responsible for some form of child neglect,' said Danielle Meitiv, who confirmed to the Washington Post that she and her husband are to appeal the decision.

'What will happen next time?' she said. 'We don’t know if we will get caught in this Kafkaesque loop again.'

Indeed, the Meitiv's confirmed that they will ignore the CPS and carry on allowing their children independence that most parents would be terrified to grant their own kids.

Back on December 20, police in Silver Spring picked up Rafi and Dvora walking home on a Saturday afternoon from the park after a member of the public reported it.

Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitiv's make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street

Defiant: Danielle and Alexander have said that they will continue to bring up their children as she sees fit

The Meitiv's told police they often let their children walk on their own and that the kids knew the area well.

The CPS sent the Meitiv's a letter on February 20 informing them their investigation had been closed and told the Washington Post they would not be commenting on the process.

Danielle Meitiv doesn't think she they did anything wrong in giving her children a little independence.

'We're just doing what our parents did. It was considered perfectly normal just one generation ago,' she said on Today in January.

Meitiv admits that the walk back from the park was longer than her two kids had taken before, but says she wasn't worried because they have been on several shorter walks together with no issues.

'Well I've walked home from school before. Not with my sister, but I've done it alone,' 10-year-old Rafi said. 'We walked around the block a lot and we walk home from another park which is just around the block.

The Meitivs describe themselves as 'free-range parents' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world.

Both parents are highly educated. Alexander Meitiv is a Research Fellow at National Institutes of Health and Danielle is an Oceanographer. 

Usually they have the kids carry around a card that reads 'I'm not lost. I'm a free range kid' but they left them behind that day when they went to the park that was a bit further away from their house.

Asked what the CPS would do the next time they are called, they said they would simply follow procedure.

What's wrong? Danielle Meitiv (right) appeared on the Today show in January with her 10-year-old son Rafi (center) and 6-year-old daughter Dvora about a month after Child Protective Services launched an investigation because she let the two walk home from a park alone

Journey: On December 20, the brother and sister were walking about a mile home from this park when a citizen called 911 after seeing the two without their parents

'If we get a call from law enforcement or from a citizen, we are required to investigate. Our goal is the safety of children, always,' said Paula Tolson, spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Human Resources to the Washington Post.

The Meitiv's espouse the current 'free-range' parenting trend, first popularized in 2008 by New York journalist Lenore Skenazy, in a piece entitled 'Why I Let My 9-Year-Old Ride the Subway Alone.'

She was railing against helicopter parenting and speaking to the Washington Post said that she was appalled by the ruling against the Meitiv's.

'The go-to narrative in the last 20 or 30 years for parents was, ‘Take your eyes off your kid for even a second and he’ll be snatched.’ What the Meitiv case did was pivot the story to: ‘Give your kid one second of freedom and the government will arrest you.’

Speaking about her horror at the decision, Danielle Meitiv said she turned to her husband and felt humiliated.

'I was kind of horrified,' she said.

'You try as a parent to do what’s right. Parents try so hard. Even though I know they are wrong, it’s a painful judgment.'
