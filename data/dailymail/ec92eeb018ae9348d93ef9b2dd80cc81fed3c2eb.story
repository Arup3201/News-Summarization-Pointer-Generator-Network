Joleon Lescott is ready play three games in seven days for West Bromwich Albion as he manages his body through the busy Christmas period.

At 32, Lescott tailors his training to ensure he plays as often as possible, beginning with a match against his friends from Manchester City on Boxing Day.

Lescott insists any cordiality with his former team-mates will stop before kick-off, and head coach Alan Irvine has picked the brains of his best defender about the champions.

Joleon Lescott said he still has friends at Manchester City but there will be 'no friendly handshakes'

Baggies manager Alan Irvine has revealed that Lescott knows how to manage his own fitness

‘I’ve still got a lot of friends there,’ said Lescott. 'We’ll do our bit beforehand and then we can concentrate on the game. There’ll be no friendly handshakes during the game.’

After City, it is Stoke on Sunday, before West Ham on New Year’s Day. ‘I spoke to Joleon and asked him how he felt about the double-headers and straight away he said “fine”,’ said Irvine.

‘Generally Joleon will do his own ‘prehab’ and recovery sessions on a Monday and everyone is fine with that. He knows his body and he’s not just having a day off. He’s an expert at it.

‘The culture in the past has been to treat everybody the same but that can’t be right because they are all different.’
