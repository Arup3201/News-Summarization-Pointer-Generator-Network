The wreck of a British bomber that sunk during a raid on the German battleship, the Tirpitz, has been found and is likely to contain the bodies of two of the missing crew.

The Halifax bomber was located perfectly intact 600ft down in a Norwegian fjord 72 years after it crashed on the mission to destroy one of Hitler's most feared ships.

The aircraft was struck by heavy flak and made a successful crash landing in the water inlet in northern Norway.

Sergeant Alfred Columbine, who was a navigator aboard the doomed Halifax

Four of the six-man crew bailed out into a dingy but nothing was ever seen of navigator, Flight Sergeant Alfred Columbine, or wireless operator, Arthur Evans. It is believed they drowned when the bomber went down.

The children of Alfred Bernard Columbine today told of their relief that the aircraft had been found but said his body should remain where it is.

Sylvia Ireland was aged five when her father was killed in the raid on the Tirpitz in 1942 while her brother David was not born as the airman's widow, Elsie, was two months pregnant at the time.

In 1999 the two siblings made a pilgrimage to the fjord where the Halifax crashed and laid flowers there, although they didn't know where exactly it was in the water.

David Columbine, a 72-year-old retired policeman from Nottingham, said: 'I am pleased and relieved it has now been discovered.

'There is the prospect of his body being recovered and a funeral with full military honours taking place but it is a war grave and is his final resting place and maybe it should remain that way.

'In 1999 someone pinpointed roughly where the Halifax came down and our family went out there to pay our respects and lay some flowers.'

Mrs Ireland, 75, said: 'When I found out the aircraft had been found I was quite upset from my mother's point of view.

'It is a wonderful thing what they have done but that is their final resting place and that is where they should remain.'

Sgt Columbine was a carpenter for Boots before the war and volunteered for the RAF.

He was aged 32 when he died. As he was the oldest member of the Halifax crew, his comrades nicknamed him 'Pops'.

The pilot of the bomber, Fl Lt Petley, survived the war and died two years ago in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

There have been numerous attempts to find Halifax W7656 over the years with no joy until engineers laying a pipeline stumbled upon a mystery underwater object.

The marine technology department at a local university was tipped off about it and a team of six students visited the fjord and sent a remote control submarine down to inspect the object.

Video footage beamed back to their vessel on the surface revealed the Halifax bomber that had suffered barely any visible damage over the last seven decades.

Although they could not find the aircraft's serial number, given its location it is likely to be Halifax W7656. The sunken bomber will be protected as a war grave because of the likelihood of the remains of the two airman still being on board.

The bomber was part of 35 Squadron and took off from RAF Kinloss on April 28, 1942, to find and sink the Tirpitz, which was the heaviest ship in the world at the time.

The ship was positioned off Norway to deter an Allied invasion of the Nazi-occupied country as well as to intercept Arctic convoys.

In all, 23 Halifaxes and 11 Lancasters took part in the sortie, with two being shot down by German anti-aircraft defences.

It is known that W7656 has been unable to release its mines when over the target and the pilot, Flight Liuetenent Petley, came around again for a second attempt.

It's port wing was hit and caught fire at 4,000ft, causing the aircraft to rapidly lose height. The pilot managed to ditch it in a fjord and three of the six crew got out and climbed into the life raft.

Tail gunner Sgt Pomroy went to look for his two missing comrades but had to retreat into the dinghy as the plane quickly sank.

They drifted for three hours until two Norwegian men rowed out to rescue them. They were handed over to the Germans when they came ashore and spent the rest of the war in PoW camps in Germany.

Professor Martin Ludvigsen, of the marine technology department at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said: 'It was a construction company which found the plane initially. They didn't realise it was there or what it was.

Film Above Us The Waves told the story of the allied effort to sink the Tirpitz using human torpedoes and mini submarines

It took an incredible 24 operations over five years to destroy the Tirpitz.

Launched in 1939, Tirpitz was a truly monumental military machine. The length of 2½ football pitches, it was crewed by 2,600 men and armed with an astonishing array of weapons including 58 anti-aircraft cannons. The hull was protected by 13in armour plating while 5in thick decks protected the engine rooms and magazines.

Many believed the ship was unsinkable. For many years, it was.

Churchill was obsessed with the Tirpitz, declaring: 'The whole strategy of the war turns on this ship. I regard the matter as of the highest urgency and importance.'

For four years, he urged the service chiefs into finding and attacking this symbol of Nazi might. On one memorable occasion, he wrote to the First Sea Lord: 'The crippling of this ship would alter the face of the war, and the loss of 100 machines or 500 airmen would be well compensated for.' 

In October 1942, the Navy deployed its secret weapon, the optimistically named 'Mk1 Human Torpedo'. The plan entailed two divers riding a self-propelled torpedo before detaching the warhead, fixing it to the hull, then making their escape. Dreadful weather conspired to render the attack a failure.

Mini submarines were deployed in September 1943, but despite causing some damage, Tirpitz stayed in action. In April 1944, a massive raid was mounted by the Fleet Air Arm that resulted in the ship being 'peppered with bombs' and the deaths of 122 German sailors.

But still the mighty warship remained in service.

In autumn 1944, Tony Iveson and his RAF colleagues from 617 Squadron (of Dambusters fame) and 9 Squadron entered the fray. Operating at the very limits of their endurance, modified Lancaster bombers were flown to a base in Russia, from where attacks could be mounted.

Finally, on November 12, 1944, a force of 30 British bombers, armed with massive 12,000lb 'Tallboy' earthquake bombs, descended on Tirpitz off the coast of Tromso in Norway. The crews delivered their huge payloads with great accuracy, death and destruction raining down on the pride of the German fleet.

As the smoke and steam cleared, one RAF gunner in a rear turret reported: 'Hey Skip, I think she's keeling over.' Tirpitz's war was finally at an end. Of 1,700 sailors on board, nearly 1,000 perished in the explosions and the icy waters. Countless RAF and Naval personnel had made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure its destruction. 

The endeavours of the human torpedoes and mini submarines were told in the 1955 film Above Us The Waves.

'We went to the site and used a remote controlled underwater vehicle which dived to 180 metres. It was quite exciting. We could see from the images that it was the Halifax and was in good condition.

'We realised it might be a British war grave and were very careful and respectful. There were loud cheers when we discovered the plane.'

The Norwegian Aviation Museum and the British Embassy have been informed of the find. It is not clear as to what will happen next or if a search for the missing airmen will be carried out.

Anders Utjaard, the director of the museum, said: 'The aircraft is still owned by the UK and is being looked after by Norway as it is in our waters.

'We have reason to believe there maybe the remains of two airmen on board and by Norwegian law nobody is allowed to touch it without proper authority.

'Any search for the airmen would require divers and it would be up to the British authorities.'

A spokesman for the British Embassy in Oslo confirmed they had been made aware of the discovery and were consulting with the RAF's Air Historical Branch as to how to proceed.

The Tirpitz was attacked on numerous occasions by the Allies and was finally sunk in November 1944.
