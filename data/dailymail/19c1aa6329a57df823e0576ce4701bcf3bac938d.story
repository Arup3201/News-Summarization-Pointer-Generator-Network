Sheryl Sandberg may be telling the women of the world to 'Lean In', but, according to a new study, 32per cent would still prefer to give up their career and rely on their partner for money.

The poll - conducted by money-saving website CouponCodes4u - asked 2,135 adult females in the U.S. with full-time jobs: 'Would you prefer to work for a living, or be a "lady of leisure" and have your partner look after you financially?'

While it found that the majority - 55per cent - would prefer to keep their careers, more than a third said they would rather be looked after by their other halves.

The remaining 13per cent of the women polled said they were unsure of their preference.

The results are in opposition to the feminist message in Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's best-seller, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.

In the book, Ms Sandberg discusses workplace inequality and the strains - many of them self-imposed - put on working women who also want to have families.

She concludes that women must be more proactive in pursuing their ambitions in order to earn equality with men in the office.

Mark Pearson, chairman of CouponCodes4u, said in a statement: 'Being a lady of leisure has always had somewhat of a negative connotation in the States.'

Nevertheless, 79per cent of the respondents - all of whom were in co-habiting relationships - said that they would not feel guilty about their lifestyle if they shunned their career and relied on their spouse.

The study also found that only 21per 
cent of women would continue to work if their partner paid for the 
majority of items and bills.

In fact, over half - 56per cent - said 
they thought their spouse should contribute more towards household bills
and payments if they earned more money in the relationship.

And, although all of the women polled 
were employed at the time of the survey, 57per cent admitted 
that they frequently accepted money from their partner to pay for 
purchases and restaurant meals.

By contrast, just 17per cent said that they themselves regularly picked up the check when out to meals with their partner.

When the women were asked which items their spouse was most likely to pay for in the relationship, the majority - 79per cent - said restaurant meals.

Vacation was second on the list, with 75per cent of respondents saying that their partner was mostÂ  likely to pay for their trips. And in third was food shopping, with 67per cent admitting they frequently let their spouse pay for household groceries.
