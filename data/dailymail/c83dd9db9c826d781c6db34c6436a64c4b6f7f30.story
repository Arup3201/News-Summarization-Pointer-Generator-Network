As firefighters battle to contain the Colorado wildfires and clean-up crews trawl through the debris following the Oklahoma tornado, a series of maps have been published that illustrate the most deadly places in America.

The data may look spectacular laid out in colorful graphics, but they clearly identify the deadly effects of Mother Nature.

The maps were created by John Nelson, a UX & Mapping manager at IDV Solutions and were reported by the Business Insider.

Using a spreadsheet he converted the data into  a pixelated 
map of the U.S which created the spectacular graphics.

After plotting the data he was able to create charts which show the most disaster-prone areas across America.

75 per cent of all tornadoes on Earth occur in the U.S. and Mr Nelson used the data to construct a vivid electric blue map of tornadoes.

He detailed where they had occurred 
since 1950 - the most recent was the terrifying tornado was devastated 
parts of Oklahoma and killed 22 people.

 is currently helping firefighters douse Colorado's most destructive 
wildfire in state history, while a new wind-whipped blaze in California 
is forcing evacuations and threatened homes near Yosemite National Park.

The release of the maps come as U.S. 
mayors pledged this week to make their communities more resilient to 
increasingly severe floods, droughts, extreme storms and wildfires, 
which they said was more efficient and cost-effective than disaster 
clean-up afterwards.

Four dozen elected officials, from 
localities as diverse as Washington D.C., Des Moines, Iowa and Santa 
Barbara County, California, released a one-page plan which laid out 
actions such as using more renewable energy and making buildings and 
infrastructure more energy-efficient.

The Resilient Communities for America
 Agreement was launched less than a week after New York Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg announced a $20 billion plan to prepare his city for rising 
sea levels and hotter summers.

The actions by local officials took 
place as anticipation builds that the White House is planning a series 
of executive actions in July to address climate.
  Federal action can help, but local 
officials are at the front lines of natural disasters, said Des Moines 
Mayor Frank Cownie. Iowa's biggest city saw severe flooding in 2008, a 
trio of '500-year' floods in 2010, a drought in 2012 and the wettest 
year in 140 years of record-keeping so far in 2013.

'These extreme events are becoming more and more prevalent, and local government is really where it happens,' Cownie said.

He said Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) personnel sometimes are not on the scene until days after 
disaster strikes, when local officials have already gone ahead with 
recovery efforts without waiting for federal approval.

'When they show up, it's good; 
they've got those T-shirts on with FEMA on the back, but they're just 
taking notes ... We need decision-makers in the throes of an event and 
we need them immediately,' Cownie said.

El Paso Mayor John Cook said his 
desert city has been bombarded by wild weather since he took office: 
Three years' worth of rain arrived in one week in 2006, causing some 
$450 million in damage, while in 2011, El Paso's normally warm weather 
snapped cold, with temperatures below those of Anchorage, Alaska, for 
five days, straining local gas lines.

El Paso has spent $100 million to 
make its buildings more efficient, installing solar panels on library 
roofs and improving mass transit, with buses that run on compressed 
natural gas, to cut down on fossil-fueled vehicle traffic.

'The state of Texas should hang their
 head in shame,' Cook said. 'They don't have realistic goal-setting to 
use renewable energy.'
