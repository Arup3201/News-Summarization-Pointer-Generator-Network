A coffee shop in freezing Canada has received a shot of warmth after being yarn bombed.

A branch of Tim Hortons in Fort Frances, Ontario - where temperatures are set to plummet to minus 15 Celsius this weekend - has been coated in meters of wool thanks to  a needle-wielding army of locals.

Couches, floors and chairs appear covered in neat knots of thread with customers soaking in its soft touch.

The sewing group even created a giant beanie hat to go on top of the restaurant, complete with the brand's logo. 

They then crocheted an equally large scarf to wrap around the store front, being careful not to seal the door.

Sticking to the company colors they selected scarlet red and white fibers.

On December 11 the town of Fort Frances was all abuzz over the mysterious 'yarn bombing' of trees, fire hydrants, mail boxes and even park benches around town. 

Two days later, the residents  woke up to long strings of red yarn all over town - leading them straight to the local Tim Hortons.

The Canadian coffee company picked the Fort Frances store for the stunt as it's known for being one of the coldest spots in North America.

It then went about gathering a volunteer crew together.

Gord McQuarrie, who owns the franchise, said the decision came as a big surprise to everyone, even him.  

He received a telephone call asking if he'd give up the store for a couple of days for a special project and willingly obliged.

'We have amazing guests at our Tim Hortons and I'm thrilled we were able to surprise them in this special way just in time for the holidays,' McQuarrie said.

'We succeeded in spreading warmth - we gave out hundreds of cups of free coffee and hot chocolate and everyone looked happy and comfortable inside the restaurant.'

To spread even more warmth, Tim Hortons is donating yarn to various knitting groups across the country to help knit warm accessories for people in need. The company is encouraging customers to spread the #WarmWishes.
