Record numbers of pensioners are working, but the number of young people searching for a job for more than six months has also hit an all-time high, official figures revealed yesterday.

The figures highlight the problems facing Britain’s troubled labour market as pensioners are forced to keep on working because of a lack of money, but young people cannot find work.

Nearly one million pensioners have jobs, but nearly 500,000 under-24s want one but cannot find one, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Good and bad: Despite a drop in unemployment the numbers claiming jobseeker's allowance is up, particularly among women

Neil Duncan-Jordan, from the National 
Pensioners’ Convention, said: ‘A lot of our members are keen that their 
grandchildren can get a job.

‘They think the young deserve a chance, but they worry they are not going to get one.

‘As the state pension age rises, we 
will be making the old work for longer but keeping the young on 
unemployment benefits, which is a ridiculous way to do things.’

The ONS said there were 929,000 
over-65s working, the largest number since records began 20 years ago. 
Between March and May, an extra 565 people every day joined Britain’s 
army of older workers as baby boomers, born after the end of the Second 
World War, realised they did not want – or could not afford – to stop 
work.

But the ONS figures highlight chronic problems at the other end of the age spectrum.

The number of young people between the
age of 16 and 24 who have been looking for a job for more than six 
months has jumped by 30 per cent over the past year.

Howevwer, in the past quarter it has fallen 10,000 on the quarter. Of those, the number of young people out of education and seeking work is now 724,000 and the number of full time students looking for a job is 299,000.

In total, 489,000 young people have fallen into this trap which is also the highest number since records began in 1992.

Paul Brown, director of the youth 
charity The Prince’s Trust, said: ‘There are now more long-term 
unemployed young people in the UK than ever before, with hundreds of 
thousands feeling they will spend their lives on the scrapheap.

‘We need to focus on supporting the most vulnerable young people, who are being pushed to the back of the dole queue.

‘If we invest in young people now, we can save the state billions in benefits and lost productivity.’

The figures come after the Government 
scrapped the default retirement age last year which means bosses can no 
longer kick out a worker simply because they have reached 65.

As the state pension age is increased,
the trend of people working beyond the age of 65 will continue. The 
state pension age will reach 67 in 2028, and will continue to rise. 
Evidence from Portugal, which raised its State pension age from 62 to 65
for women in 1993, proves that it triggers problems for young people.

Research from the Institute for the 
Study of Labour concluded: ‘Firms hire approximately one fewer worker 
for each older worker that is retained due to the higher mandatory 
retirement age.

‘We also find that younger workers 
and, in particular, younger women are the demographic groups most 
affected by the lower level of total hirings.’

Overall, ministers yesterday welcomed a drop in unemployment, which fell by 65,000 between March and May to 2.58million.

But economists said the figure was 
skewed by a large drop in London after a hiring spree triggered by 
temporary events such as the Olympics and the Diamond Jubilee 
celebrations.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith said: 'The previous Government’s approach to employment programmes meant young people were put onto schemes that took them off the unemployment register, but when they left the schemes many went straight back onto benefits.

'Resetting the clock so that young people weren’t counted as long-term unemployed didn't help them get a job - they were still unemployed whatever the official statistics said.

'We have stopped this nonsense and it is only Liam Byrne who persists with the notion that these young people were in jobs.

'We have challenged the opposition to come clean and stop playing fast and loose with the facts, but no one will be surprised that they haven't responded.'
