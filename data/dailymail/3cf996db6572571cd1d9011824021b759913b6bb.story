A cat has been hit with 'an animal ASBO' after allegedly biting and scratching people while also damaging property. 

Rocky, who is owned by Samantha Davies in Rotherham, Yorkshire received a letter concerning her cat's behaviour. 

The letter warned that council officials received 'several complaints' about Rocky which have caused 'alarm, distress and annoyance'.

Council officials accused Rocky, pictured, of scratching and biting some of his neighbours 

Ms Davies put a sign outside her back gate defending Rocky, claiming that he is not a nasty cat

Under the terms of the notice, Rocky is banned from leaving Ms Davies' house or she will have to pay any damage caused.  

The letter read: 'I am in receipt of several complaints regarding your cat Rocky causing alarm, distress and annoyance to other residents in the area of your property.

'Although I appreciate that cats do roam, I would prefer if you could take steps to keep your cat Rocky from leaving the perimeter of your garden in the future.

'Should further complaints be received about damage done to neighbours’ property by your pet you will be charged for the repairs.'

Several residents  confirmed that Rocky would not leave their property if he jumped over a wall. 

Ms Davies claimed: 'Rocky doesn’t like being touched on certain parts of his body but he is certainly not aggressive.

'He has been accused of damaging property because he scratched a fence.

'The council has said if he does any more damage I’ll have to pay for it.

'The only time he has bitten someone was when they pulled its tail.

'I’ve heard of people being told to keep their dog under control, but never a cat.'

Ms Davies, who is studying Maths and English at Rotherham College described the entire process as ridiculous. 

Ms Davies said the council's instruction to lock Rocky inside  is cruel: He's a cat and wants to be outside'

She said: 'It’s just like an animal ASBO, and it is completely ridiculous.

'How can a cat behave antisocially? It’s an animal, it’s a pet - he’s not going to bite your leg off, drink alcohol in the street or try and rob your phone.'

When Ms Davies phoned Rotherham Borough Council to ask about the specific complaints she was told that Rocky had allegedly bitten two people, scratched an outside fence, and had intimidated residents by entering their homes and refusing to leave.

She said: 'Even if Rocky did do these things, it’s hardly what you’d deem to be antisocial behaviour.

'But where’s the proof? I haven’t seen a shred of proof that any of this even happened. I think the council need to concentrate on doing their job properly instead of following up rubbish like this.

'The council told me to lock him indoors, but in this weather I think that’s extremely cruel. He’s a cat and wants to be outside. 

'I’ve heard of people being told to keep their dog under control, but never a cat. It’s ridiculous.'

Rocky the cat, who has been hit with an 'Animal ASBO' is banned from roaming the streets of Rotherham

Council officials said they had received one formal complaint and two verbal complaints from residents on The Lanes estate over the behaviour of four-year-old cat, Rocky. 

One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'Rocky has bitten me on numerous occasions.

'One time he came into my house through an upstairs window and started terrorising my dog.

'I could hear him going mad and went up to see what the problem was and Rocky was there.

'When I tried to get him out the house he bit me extremely hard.'

The neighbour added: 'I don’t want to see Rocky locked up, but I just want Samantha to look after him properly because he can be vicious.'

Samantha Davies asked Rotherham Council to provide evidence of her cat's anti-social behaviour

Next door neighbour David Willoughby, 65, said: 'He comes over to our house quite a bit, but we don’t have a problem with him.

'He did bite me once, but that was because he got stuck and was frightened. Sam was very apologetic about it afterwards and I didn’t have a problem.

'He’s a male cat, and he needs to assert his authority, but he’s not a bad cat really.

'I certainly didn’t make a complaint about him.'

Paul Walsh, Housing and Communities Service Manager for Rotherham Borough Council, denied the authority was being heavy-handed saying that it had a duty of care to neighbouring tenants, who have made one formal complaint and numerous verbal complaints about Rocky.

He added: 'We do appreciate it is very difficult to control a cat once they are let out but Rocky has been causing problems around the area for quite a while now and is actually terrifying some local residents who are very vulnerable.

'Last year he allegedly bit two people and his bad behaviour has continued because he causes both internal and external damage when he visits neighbouring properties. He certainly does not like being challenged and lives up to his boxing namesake!.

'We have asked his owner to take reasonable steps to try and cut down his wandering and have advised the neighbours to use a variety of cat deterrents, which certainly includes not feeding him.

'The warning letter is very much a last resort and if the owner takes reasonable steps to control him and we get no further reports from neighbouring residents then obviously this will go no further.

'As part of their tenancy agreements all pet-owning council tenants must keep any animal at their property under proper control so that they do not cause a danger, nuisance or annoyance to their neighbours or anyone visiting the property or the locality.

'This often refers to dogs but cats can also cause problems, as this case has illustrated.'
