Targeted: Cabinet maker Mark Crowther, 51, claims he suffered years of homophobic abuse at the Hands of Wycombe in Buckinghamshire

A skilled cabinet maker was forced out of his job  at a bespoke furniture factory after years of abuse by his 'homophobic' colleagues who branded him a 'queer' and 'bent', an employment tribunal heard today.

Mark Crowther, 51, claims he suffered years of homophobic taunts and was then made redundant by the company when he complained about it last year.

Mr Crowther, who worked for the Hands of Wycombe in Buckinghamshire for eight years, is now suing the 100-year-old firm  for wrongful dismissal and sexual orientation discrimination.

The tribunal heard the entire cabinet making department was branded 'the queer ones' while Mr Crowther was nicknamed 'gay Mark' by colleagues and a supervisor.

The skilled cabinet maker was also left notes on his workbench, locker and toolbox, accusing him of being 'bent' and a homosexual.

The tribunal judge heard the 'harassment' became so bad that Mr Crowther started taking pictures of the messages in a bid to document the abuse.

However, bosses at the factory in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, allegedly ignored his complaints and instead made him redundant last year.

One manager was said to have replied 'it's a man's world' when the cabinet maker tried to approach him about his alleged treatment by colleagues.

He said: 'I feel I have been harassed by my work colleagues, ignored when I tried to bring it to the attention of the management and because I complained more than once, they felt the easiest way out was by way of unfair selection for redundancy.'

The tribunal hearing in Reading, Berkshire, was told the carpenter was nicknamed 'gay Mark' and was subject to ridicule from co-workers.

Mr Crowther claimed his supervisor Adrian Walters called him 'gay boy' and 'poofty' and found his obvious discomfort amusing.

In September 2010, he said he decided he would start taking pictures of homophobic notes left on his workbench and locker, which were shown to the tribunal panel.

At the height of the alleged abuse, Mr Crowther said a male underwear catalogue was placed on his workbench, along with the words 'queer boy', 'gay Mark', and 'I love men' scrawled on masking tape stuck to the desk top.

One worker left a piece of wood on his workbench with 'you're gay' carved into it, and a warped piece of wood in the factory's store room had the words 'Bent like Mark' written on it.

However, Mr Crowther said that he when he tried to complain to his senior manager Robert Smith, he didn't want to know.

I went to find Robert Smith and his response was "it's a man's world", shrugging his shoulders.'

Hands of Wycombe - one of the UK's leading manufacturers of executive office furniture - denies wrongful dismissal and discrimination.

The company, founded by renowned chair maker William Hands, has been manufacturing at its High Wycombe factory for more than 100 years.

The firm also has a swanky showroom in Islington, north London, from where it supplies boardroom tables and luxury office furniture to major companies.

Senior manager Wade Dunford claimed Mr Crowther only raised a grievance about receiving homophobic abuse after he was told that he was to lose his job in a round of redundancies at the company in May last year.

Mr Dunford, who is head of design and production at the firm, said he appraised all of the staff fairly before making Mr Crowther redundant and stood by his decision.

He said he was 'taken aback' by Mr Clowther's harassment claims and admitted an internal investigation had since exposed a culture of homophobic 'banter' at the firm.

Mr Dunford added: 'Mr Walters said that sometimes the drivers would call out "queer ones" at the cabinet shop department.'

The claimant, he said, was called 'gay Mark' and he had never complained about it - it was all part of the shop floor banter.

Mr Walters said he may have called him 'gay Mark' on occasions but not 'poofter' as far as he could recall.

Other employees interviewed by Mr Dunsford confirmed Mr Crowther, of Sheepcote Dell Road, Holmer Green, Buckinghamshire, was known as 'Gay Mark' on the shop floor.

'In their view, the name calling was part of banter in the factory, and that it was not just aimed solely at the claimant,' Mr Dunsford said.

He added: 'We now understand that the cabinet makers as a whole were called the "queer ones" as part of the banter in the factory and that his colleagues had told us that he had shown no sign to them that he objected to this banter including being called "gay Mark" over the eight years of employment (with Hands).'

Mr Dunford said he was 'surprised' about the nature of the so-called banter, and claimed he hadn't come across it once during his 24 years with the company.
