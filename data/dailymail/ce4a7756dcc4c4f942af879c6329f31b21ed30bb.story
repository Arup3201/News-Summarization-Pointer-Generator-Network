A 22-year-old woman found a used syringe full of liquid lying on top of a Peppa Pig book in a hospital toy box after a member of staff did not dispose of it safely. 

She posted a picture of the syringe  surrounded by children's toys with a caption saying 'NHS at its 'f***ing finest'.

The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said it was 'shameful behaviour' from Bassetlaw Hospital in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, and asked 'how can anyone be so careless?'

Bosses at the hospital investigated the incident and admitted that a member of staff did not dispose of the syringe safely.

Eki Emovon, children and families care group director, said: 'A syringe was found in a toy storage box on Ward A2 at Bassetlaw Hospital on 26th February 2015.

'No patients, visitors or staff came to any harm as a result of this incident.

'An investigation was launched and we have identified that a member of staff had not disposed of the syringe safely and we will deal with this according to Trust policies.

'Patient safety is at the forefront of everything we do, and we will put systems and practices in place to ensure this incident is not repeated.'

A woman who visited the same hospital while her mother was treated for a heart attack said she saw an unopened syringe on one of the tables. 

“I had my mum admitted to hospital at the beginning of December with a heart attack,' said the woman who wished to remain anonymous.

“She was initially put onto an assessment ward where she was left with a vial of what I believe was Morphine on her tray by her bed.

“On going to stand in the corridor whilst doctors assessed her, we saw an unopened syringe just sat on the side on one of the tables.”

“She was eventually admitted to the coronary care unit where she recovered.”
