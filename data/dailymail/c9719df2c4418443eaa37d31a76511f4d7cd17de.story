Families are to foot the bill for Sky’s decision to pay £4.2billion for Premier League football rights after the firm sneaked out an inflation-busting price rise on Budget Day.

The firm is putting up the price of its Family bundle of channels by nine per cent or £3 a month to £36, or £432 a year.

The bundle does not even include its sports channels, which means those who have no interest in football are subsidising Sky’s deal to show Premier League games.

Sky is putting up the price of its Family bundle of channels by nine per cent or £3 a month, just weeks after it paid £4.2billion for the rights to screen 126 live Premier League football games a season from 2016 to 2019 

Sky paid £4.2billion to broadcast 126 live games a season from 2016 to 2019 in the Premier League

Sky is also putting up the price of its Sports Bundle, which includes a basic range of channels plus seven dedicated to sport, by £1 a month to £47 - £564 a year.

Film fans will also be hit with a 50p a month increase in the cost of the Sky Movies package and some £1.50 a month more for the combination of movies and sport.

Critics say the price rises appear to be an attempt to recoup the huge sum that will be paid to super rich clubs like Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City.

Sky paid £4.2 billion to show 126 live English Premier League matches a season from 2016 to 2019. That equates to £11m per game, which is up by 66per cent compared to the current TV deal.

Analysts suggested the TV giant overpaid for the football rights in order to fend off competition from BT and others, however it is clear that the pain is now being passed to viewers, whether they like sport or not.

When the deal was announced, the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, heralded it as a success story for the nation’s biggest and richest clubs.

However, it is viewers who will be funding the Ferraris, Lamborghinis and £200,000 a week contracts of the likes of Wayne Rooney, Yaya Toure, Eden Hazard, and Falcao.

The company, which has more than 11m customers in the UK, bid about £300m a year more than analysts had expected in February’s auction.

At the time Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, said the bill would largely be financed by cost cuts, however, he hinted that price rises would be necessary.

The timing of the announcement appears designed to limit media coverage. Details appeared on the firm’s website on Wednesday, when the nation’s attention was focused on George Osborne’s Budget.

Attempts to reach Sky spokesmen were frustrated by the fact most were at the London premiere of the new season of TV fantasy drama, Game of Thrones.

Normally, Sky would announce any price rise in September, however making the announcement then would have coincided with its loss of the TV rights for the Champions League to BT. It would have been obvious to viewers that they were being asked to pay more for less.

The inflation-busting increases will come into effect on June 1 and coincide with the middle of the latest series of Game of Thrones. Fans will effectively have to agree to the higher subscription.

Sky last increased prices in September with the figure for its Sports Bundle going up by six per cent. That meant the price of its Sports package had risen about 30 per cent above inflation since 2001.

The fact it is putting up prices yet again could well drive millions of people to switch to the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime, both of which cost less than £7 a month.

Viewer reaction to the news was hostile. One contributor to the Engadget website wrote: ‘Hey Sky, I don’t care if you overpaid Premier League, I’m not paying for something I didn’t buy.’

Another, wrote: ‘If only Game of Thrones was available elsewhere I could cancel.... Surely the sports option itself should pay for the bid?’

A third questioned the rises for the non-sport packages. He wrote: ‘So wait, they’re increasing their prices to cover Premier League costs, yet the sports package is the one that’s increasing least? Way to show your audience who’s important!’

Another said: ‘I think it’s time I dump my Sky subscription. There is now so much competition in the market I can get the same content elsewhere.’

Virgin Media has complained to the TV regulator Ofcom about the way Premier League rights are sold to broadcasters, claiming it leads to expensive subscriptions which do not even provide live coverage of every game.

Spokesman, Brigitte Trafford, said: ‘Too many people feel they now have to choose between basic essentials and watching the game they love. If action is not taken to change the way the Premier League sells TV rights, the rapidly rising cost of watching football at home will see even more people priced out of the national sport.’

Sky offered a bizarre explanation for the timing of the announcement, claiming it was necessary to comply with regulations imposed by the Advertising Standards Authority. In fact, the ASA has absolutely no role in the timing of such announcements.

A spokesman said: ‘We work hard to make Sky the best value entertainment choice for subscribers. On average, bills will rise by less than £3 per month.’
