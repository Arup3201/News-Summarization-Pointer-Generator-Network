Jurors in the case of a 20-year-old man accused of murdering a University of Florida student out of jealously were shown today blood-stained shoes and pictures of a shovel and belt linked to the gruesome slaying.

Pedro Bravo stands accused of strangling Christian Aguilar, 18, to death and dumping his body in the woods in September 2012 as part of a plot to reunite with his high school girlfriend, who was dating the UF student.

On Thursday, prosecutors presented in court graphic evidence in the murder case, including a weaved belt they said Bravo had used to throttle his romantic rival.

Marc Trahan, a crime scene investigator with the Gainesville Police Department, testified Thursday that he used a chemical to detect blood stains inside Bravo's blue Chevrolet Blazer, WSVN reported.

More blood was found on the insoles of a pair of shoes and a pain can stored in the SUV.

Prosecutors believe that the 20-year-old defendant strangled his former friend-turned-rival inside his vehicle after giving him Gatorade laced with a mixture of drugs during a shopping trip September 20, 2012.

On Wednesday, the court heard the second part of the testimony of Aguillar's girlfriend, Erika Friman, who detailed her relationship with the two men.

The three of them had been friends in high school. After Friman entered college, she began dating Aguillar but kept it a secret from Bravo, WWGP reported.

‘I lied to him because he was at a 
very sensitive point in his life, I supposed,’ she said. ‘I didn’t want 
to throw him over the edge and say, “By the way, I’m dating a mutual 
friend of ours.”’

When Bravo, a student at Santa Fe College, found out about his friends' budding romance, police said he became obsessed with the idea of eliminating Aguillar so he could be with Friman.

Friman told the court that she arranged a meeting between the two men after Bravo threatened to kill himself.

‘I cared about anyone who claimed they were suicidal,’ she told the court.

As part of her testimony, Friman also read entries from Bravo's journal.

‘No one will stop me,’ the suspected killer wrote. ‘I will get out of Miami and into Gainesville by January 2013 and I will get her back.’

Prosecutors say on September 21, 2012, Pedro Bravo spent 13 minutes strangling Christian Aguillar in a Wal-Mart parking lot before burying the body.

Aguilar's skeletal remains were discovered in October 2012 - several weeks after his murder - by hunters in forest off State Road 24 near Cedar Key in Levy County.

On Tuesday, Kramer showed a photo of Bravo and Aguilar as high school pals in Miami and surveillance photos of them buying a Kanye West CD at Best Buy in Gainesville, according to Gainsville.com.

But he also showed gruesome pictures of Aguilar's remains to the courtroom, and Bravo didn't react.

Other surveillance pictures showed Bravo buying a shovel, drugs, duct tape, a knife and other items from Lowe's and Wal-Mart that were used in the alleged killing.

The prosecution's case leans on Bravo's journal and sketchbook, in which he detailed his bubbling resentment regarding his and Friman's break up and the fact she had began to date Aguilar.

'His plan is to get her back,' Kramer said of Bravo. 'He's got to reunite with Erika.'

In preparation for the murder, Kramer said, Bravo searched the Internet for information on murder, anesthetics and cutting veins, and then on the fateful day he lured Aguilar to his car and then suffocated him using possibly a belt around his neck in the back seat.

'He cuts off the air to his airway and blood to his brain,' Kramer said. 'He would later (tell someone) it took Christian 13 minutes to die.'

Friman and Bravo were dating at high school in Miami but Friman ended things before leaving to Gainsville to attend Santa Fe College, where Bravo later followed.

Friman reported that Aguilar was missing when he failed to meet her as planned on September 20.
