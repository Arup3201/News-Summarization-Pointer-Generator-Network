Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps is once again having the alleged details of his sexual escapades shared by a former paramour. 

This time around it is Kim Petro, a 36-year-old plus-sized dominatrix from New York City who is detailing her wild night spent with the swimmer, one that she claims involved her urinating on him and Phelps wearing women's underwear.

This all comes just a few months after another woman, Taylor Lianne Chandler, came forward to detail her sexually-fueled relationship with the highly-decorated athlete.

It also comes a month after Phelps popped the question to girlfriend Nicole Johnson, a former Miss California. 

Plus-sized dominatrix Kim Petro (above) has given an interview claiming she had a wild night with swimmer Michael Phelps who paid her a $900 'donation'

'When he said drink some water before I get to the hotel, I knew what I was in for,' said Petro of Phelps (above)

She alleges that she urinated on Phelps while he lay on his bed in the London hotel in women's underwear in February 2013. Afterwards, she claims she showed him her breasts while he pleasured himself and two smoked marijuana together

In an interview with The National Enquirer, Petro says that Phelps contacted her in February 2013 and paid a $900 'donation' for her to come to his hotel room at The London in Manhattan.

This after an online posting that said; 'All-natural, super busty fetish provider with all the right curves in all the right places.

'Time with me is time well spent. Nothing shocks me. Don't be shy.'

Phelps, Petro claims, called her on his cell phone, saying his name was Fabian Marasciullo, a Miami music producer who is close to Phelps' good friend, rapper Lil' Wayne.

'When he said drink some water before I get to the hotel, I knew what I was in for,' said Petro.

'I was going to go to the bathroom anyway - I figured I might as well get paid for it!' 

When she got to the hotel she claims Phelps removed his shirt and then shorts to reveal that he was wearing 'skimpy women's underwear.'

They then smoked a little weed according to Petro and got down to business.

'I got above him [on the bed] to [urinate on him],' said Petro.

'After I was done, he asked if it was okay to [pleasure himself]. Of course, I’m going to bend the rules a little for a famous Olympian, so he pulled down his panties.'

That is when she claims she noticed he had a string tied around his genitals.

'I grabbed [the string] and pulled, and I also took out my breasts because he wanted to see them,' she said. 

This comes just months after another of Phelps' former paramours, Taylor Lianne Chandler (above), shared details of their alleged sexual romps. 'The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman,' said Chandler of Phelps

Phelps proposed to girlfriend Nicole Johnson, a former Miss California, last month

Chandler, 41, also detailed her relationship with Phelps to the Enquirer, specifically their first date that involved sex in a public restroom at a Baltimore Ravens game.

'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she said in the interview.

'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' 

Chandler, who was born intersex and claims she met Phelps on the dating and hookup app Tinder, also said; 'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair. I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him.' 

She also claimed she was with Phelps when he was arrested and jailed for DUI last September, which resulted in a six-month suspension from competitive swimming.

He announced on his Instagram in February that he and Johnson had become engaged, sharing a photo of the two and writing; 'She said yes.'
