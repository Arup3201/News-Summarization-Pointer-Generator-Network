Showdown: Customer CJ Stout saw the gunman and waited for an opportunity to tackle him and stop the robbery

The Tulsa World reports that the gunman remains at large. 

The encounter happened at approximately 8:45 p.m. on Jan. 21 when the gunman burst into the store with a hoodie and a mask covering his face.

Security cameras captured him pointing a gun at the clerk, who slowly takes money out of the register. 

As the gunman reaches for the cash Stout rush him and tackles him. 

The gunman got a shot off into Stout's shoulder before the two tumbled to the ground and the robber began pistol whipping his head.

The gunman then raced away before authorities could arrive. 

'We’ve had no tips so far,' said Sgt. Mike Mahan. 'This is an obviously dangerous guy who definitely needs to be caught'

He is described as being roughly 5 feet 8 inches tall and possibly in his teens.

Staggered and shot: Stout was lucky to be alive as police say if he had been shot inches left or right he would have died

'If you look at it, just a foot to one way or the other and (Stout) could have been killed. It could have turned out very, very badly,' Mahan said. 

The bullet exited below his ribs on the left side and Stout was released from a hospital the following day.

'I didn’t really feel it when I got shot, I figure because of the adrenaline,' he said. 'The pain is still there — the bullet traveled pretty deep. I’ve seen before where people get shot after the fact, after the robbery, and I figured I didn’t know what was going to happen. I didn’t want to just sit there and wait.'
