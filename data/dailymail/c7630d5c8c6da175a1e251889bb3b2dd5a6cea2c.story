William Pooley, 29, was the first Briton to catch the disease in several decades and was repatriated last month by the RAF

The British nurse evacuated to the UK after contracting the Ebola virus has announced he will return to Africa.

William Pooley, 29, was the first Briton to catch the disease in several decades and was repatriated last month by the RAF.

He survived the deadly virus after receiving life-saving care at the Royal Free Hospital in London and is now planning to return to Sierra Leone.

Speaking to the Guardian Mr Pooley said returning was ‘the least’ he ‘could do’ but that more needs to be done by western powers to help contain the epidemic which is still ravaging large parts of West Africa.

He said: ‘It's a global problem and it needs global level leadership so Obama and Cameron... need to show some more leadership on this issue.

‘Sierra Leone needs lots of international health-care workers working with big NGOs like MSF and Red Cross. All of that needs to be increased.’

‘So while I'm happy to be recovered and alive, there's a lot of stuff on my mind with what's going on back there.

‘It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there, and it's really the least I could do having received all this amazing care and have people look after me and potentially save my life. It's the least I could do to go back and return the favour to some other people, even just for a little while.

‘The more help they get the less chance there is they get sick. If they get sick they are just going to end up in a ward in Kenema with less chance than I had.’

His mother Jackie admitted that, although she and husband Robin had hoped after the trauma of being evacuated from where he had been working, their son would not return, she ‘would feel very proud of him.’

He said: 'It would be relatively safe for me to go back and work there, and it's really the least I could do having received all this amazing care and have people look after me and potentially save my life'
