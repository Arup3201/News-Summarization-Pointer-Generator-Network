A prostitute killed her pimp boyfriend then posed as him on Facebook for five years in an attempt to fool his family and get her hands on his money.

June Buttle, 56, killed her 'domineering' partner of ten years Thomas Groome, 54, by hitting him over the head with a piece of wood before his body was dismembered and burned, a court heard.

She then used his Facebook account to try and convince his family that he had run away to Portugal where he was living the single life and wanted nothing more to do with them.

Sheffield Crown Court heard Buttle then tried to access Mr Groome's bank accounts where he had stored 150,000 Euros he was awarded after being abused in a care home as a child.

Today  Buttle was jailed for 16 years after admitting manslaughter, with Mrs Justice Andrews telling her: 'You lied so much and so continually that it is difficult to separate the truth from the fiction.' 

Mr Groome had been in a long-term relationship with Buttle, but the court heard that it was sexually abusive, and that Mr Groome had often forced her into prostitution.

Mr Groome was a car salesman by trade, but often had little to live on, staying in friends' houses and  caravans, often without heating or running water.

But in 2009 he was awarded 150,000 Euros compensation by a court after he was found to have been abused in a care home in County Offaly, Ireland. 

The court heard that Mr Groome had used the money to buy a caravan and two cars, and had planned to use the money to move to Portugal and open a bar.

However, three days before he died Mr Groome got into an argument with Buttle after she refused to move abroad, and accused him of keeping the money from her. 

The court was told he flew into a rage after she refused to have sex with him and stormed off. 

Three days later, on New Year's Day 2010, Buttle and her son, Jason Thaxter, beat Mr Groome over the head with two pieces of wood, before rolling his body up in a carpet, the court heard.

It is not known exactly what became of the body, but Buttle is reported to have told friends that Mr Thaxter cut the corpse into pieces before burning it on a bonfire. 

However, Buttle has refused to tell police what happened and the Crown Prosecution Service said that there was not enough evidence to charge Mr Thaxter with disposing of the body.

After Mr Groome disappeared Buttle began posting status updates on his Facebook page pretending to be him, and claiming he was still alive.

She falsely suggested he had run off with a younger woman in Portugal and didn’t want to contact his family because he thought they were after his money.

Buttle killed Mr Groome at this house in Doncaster on New Year's Day in 2010 after a row. She is believed to have attacked him with son Jason Thaxter, who is thought to have burned the body

Posts she wrote on his page read: 'Never want to return to England or Ireland, too many bad memories' and 'Enjoying my freedom now I’m single.'

Buttle then tried to get access to Mr Groome's money, which she believed was being stored in a UK bank account that she had access to.

But unbeknownst to her, the cash was actually being stored in a separate account in Ireland, leaving her with little more than access to Mr Groome's benefits money.

Over the next few months she took £800 from Mr Groome, including £400 taken from his body, but was unable to get her hands on the larger haul.

In desperation she persuaded another man to go to Ireland and pose as Mr Groome, saying he had lost his debit card, in order to access the money, but failed.

Adrian Waterman QC, prosecuting, said: 'Her main aim was to get access to the many thousands of Euros or pounds of the compensation money. Fortunately she was unable to do so.' 

In the meantime, police began investigating My Groome's disappearance after his family became concerned when they were unable to contact him abroad.

Investigators eventually contacted Buttle's friend John Ward, with whom she lived, and Lorraine Kelly, who said she had confessed to the killing.

Mr Ward told officers: 'She said: "We just gave him the one, two, three. We banged him with a baseball bat and he’s been put on a bonfire.”'

Miss Kelly added: 'She told me: “All men are bastards. I sorted that bastard. He was a hard bastard to get down but Jason and I got him down.”

“He’s cut up and in bits in bins. No-one will ever find him. He’s in bins, burned and cut up.”'

Officers first interviewed Buttle in 2013, but she kept up her charade for another two years before finally admitting what she had done.

Officers have spent more than £1million in trying to unravel the case and nearly 100 police officers have been involved in the UK, Ireland and Portugal. 

Doreen Groome, Mr Groome’s sister, said: 'Five years of not knowing what has happened to him and the whereabouts of his body have been mental torture to the family. 

Sheffield Crown Court was told that Buttle tried to access 150,000 Euros (£110,000) that Mr Groome was paid in compensation after being abused in a care home as a child, but was unable to get her hands on it

'Not being able to bury Tommy has been indescribable.'

Mr Groome's daughter Sinead added: 'The people who did this were meant to care for him. It is heartless and cruel that they knew we would never see him again.'

Dexter Dias QC, defending, said the couple’s relationship had been marred by domestic violence and Mr Groome had forced his partner to work as a prostitute since he came out of prison.

'Over a period of years he effectively used to pimp her out,' he said. 'It is an important contextualising matter. When the incident did happen she lost control.'

He went on: 'It was something which occurred on the spur of the moment. It was not pre-meditated, she delievered a single blow.'

The court also heard that Mr Groome, who had a long history of offending, was himself convicted of manslaughter after stabbing his own son, Christopher, 19, in 1999.

Christopher died after the pair got into a 'tussle' in a caravan in County Offlay. Mr Groome previously described how he watched his son die in his arms.

He went on the run but was eventually caught sentenced to seven years at Dublin in 2004.

The term was reduced on appeal and he was released the following year because of the time he had already served on remand.

Buttle was said to have stood by him when he came out and they moved to the UK and were staying with family in South Yorkshire when Groome lost his life.
