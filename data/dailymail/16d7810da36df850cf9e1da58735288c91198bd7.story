When a morbidly obese new bride looked at her wedding photos - it ended up saving her life.

Gemma Martin, 31, from Taunton, Somerset, weighed a staggering 34 stone on her wedding day. She endured walking and breathing difficulties while walking down the aisle due to her size.

But it was only when size 32 Gemma saw the wedding photo of herself - and dubbed herself one of the fattest brides in Britain - that she decided to take life saving action.

When she walked down the aisle at 34 stone, Gemma had breathing problems (l) she since shed 20 stone

Gemma has managed to shed an incredible 20 stone to date, weighing in at 14 stone and wearing a size 16. She has even managed to have a baby too.

She said: 'I'd would have never been able to be a mum when I was so heavy, so its only because I've managed to lose all that weight that I've been able to have my beautiful daughter.

'And it has ended up saving my life too. When I weighed 34 stone, I couldn't breathe properly or walk and I was at risk of getting diabetes too, which would have been lifethreatening.

'So losing all that weight has not only saved my life - but made me a mum too.'

Gemma, who lives with husband Paul, 41, a pharmaceutical packaging operator, had struggled with her weight all her life.

She said: 'By the age of five I was already chubby, and at the age of ten I weighed 12 stone and needed an adult sized school uniform.

'I was teased at school for being so fat, and I had no friends. I never got invited to any parties and after school I'd hide in my room and cry. My only comfort was eating chocolate and bread.'

Gemma tried to diet throughout her teens, but nothing seemed to work. She piled on even more weight.

In January 2003 she joined an internet dating site and met Paul. They hit it off and got married in July 2008.

Gemma said: 'We had an amazing wedding day with 60 of our close friends and family and it was the happiest day of my life. My mum and Paul told me that I looked lovely, but when the wedding photos came back, I was horrified at how enormous I looked.

'I felt like I must be one of the fattest brides in Britain. My dress looked too small for me, and I had rolls of fat everywhere. At 34 stone, I was the heaviest that I'd ever been. I gorged on bread - I'd often eat six slices at lunchtime, and then huge portions of dinner in the evenings.

'I knew instantly that I had to start losing weight. I really wanted to have a family with Paul and I knew that if I didn't change, I wouldn't even live long enough to be a mum. Paul said that he loved me whatever I looked like, but he said he would support me throughout it all if I decided to lose the weight.'

So Gemma went to see her doctor to ask for help. She was referred for a gastric bypass and the operation took place at Musgrove Hospital in Taunton in January 2011.

She said: 'I was nervous before the operation, but I knew that I was doing it for our future.'

After the surgery she ate tiny portions of food, and the weight began to drop off.

She
 said: 'Every month I had to buy smaller and smaller clothes - it felt 
like a new me was beginning to emerge from all that day.'

It took two years for her to lose a 
staggering 14 stone - and during that time, she even fell pregnant. She 
gave birth to daughter Saoirse, in January last year.

She
 said: 'I couldn't believe it when I fell pregnant. I'd suffered from 
polycystic ovaries as well, which also caused me to put on weight and 
may have meant that I couldn't get pregnant. So when I found out I was 
actually pregnant, I was thrilled.

It was amazing, I just kept losing weight throughout my pregnancy, instead of putting any on. I'd lost 13 stone by the time I fell pregnant, and then I lost another stone throughout the pregnancy.

'When she was born it was such an amazing feeling to be a mum at last. When I look at my wedding dress now, I feel proud that it was the inspiration behind my weight loss.

'If I hadn't seen those awful wedding pictures of myself bulging out of it, who knows where I would be today.

'That wedding dress not only saved my life, but it allowed me to become a mum too.'

Gemma really wanted to have a family with Paul and knew at her 34st size she wouldn't even live long enough
