A young Pakistani cricket player and his entire family are being kicked out of Belgium after he was labelled a terrorist for carrying his bat on public transport.

A photograph of Assim Abassi, who authorities thought was armed with a weapon, was circulated by the police last week and generated a terror scare. The incident followed an attack on the Jewish museum in Brussels earlier this year. 

When the 22-year-old saw his picture in local newspapers he contacted police and told them that he was only armed with a cricket bat. The piece of sporting equipment wasn't easily recognisable as he was keeping it dry.

Mr Abassi's cricket bat can clearly be identified under his top, with the thin handle facing forward, and the top of the bat's hitting surface being visible though his jumper which he used to keep the it dry before practice 

According to The Telegraph Mr Abassi said: 'I wrapped my bat in my sweatshirt because it was raining and if it is wet I can't play the ball properly.'

The pictures of Abassi circulated by police led to local newspapers warning of an 'anti-Semetic killer' on the loose in Brussels. 

In the summer, Mehdi Nemmouche, a French-born Islamist who had returned from fighting in Syria, was arrested and charged with the murders of four people after the attack on the Jewish museum in Brussels.

Despite contacting police, the entire Abassi family of seven has lost its right to remain in Belgium. The Pakistani embassy in Brussels also fired Mr Abassi's father, a diplomat, for damaging Pakistan's reputation.  

The embassy had demanded the family's passports, Mr Abassi said, who said he had lost 'everything' over the terror scare.  

The Belgian police have been criticised for failing to apologise to the cricket player and local MPs are said to have taken up his case.
