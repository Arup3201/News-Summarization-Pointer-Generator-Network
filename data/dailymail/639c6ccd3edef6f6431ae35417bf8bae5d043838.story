Coco the rottweiler has just weeks to live after being diagnosed with cancer.

But she is making every moment count by completing her own bucket list, checking off must-do activities including running on the beach, eating a steak at a restaurant and sharing an ice cream.

The eight-year-old's owners had taken to the vet after noticing she had developed a limp, where X-rays revealed tumours in her right shoulder. 

She was diagnosed with bone cancer and given only four to six weeks to live.

Making every moment count: Coco the rottweiler is completing a bucket list after being given weeks to live

Messy eating: Coco's bucket list includes sharing an ice-cream and eating fish and chips at the beach

Her owner Symon Spencer, 40, and his partner Theresa Clancy, 42, decided to create a bucket list for Coco in order to 'give her the best end of life as possible'.

So far, she has checked off items, including having a 3D scan, ordering a Big Mac from McDonald's drive-thru in a convertible and has even gone to work with both her owners.

Coco even spent a day as a police dog with Miss Clancy, who is a police officer for Surrey Police. 

Mr Spencer, who works for the First Great Western train company, said the couple were devastated when they were given Coco's diagnosis.

Coco's owners Symon Spencer and Theresa Clancy (pictured on their beach trip) decided to compile the list to give their pet the best end of life possible

He said: 'I had a bit of a cry about it right there and then when I was told.

'I asked the vet how long are we looking at and in my head I was thinking 12 months, but she said four weeks. I was devastated.

'She said just last week that we may get another couple of weeks - maybe even a month - but all dogs are different and it's hard to tell.'

Mr Spencer, from Farnborough, Hampshire, added: 'I was crying for most of the weekend after being told.

'Dogs are really clever and they pick up on your mood and adopt it, so she was feeling low too. I thought 'I need to snap out of this'.

'We came up with the bucket list idea that weekend really. We want to give Coco the best end of life possible.

Mr Spencer and Coco

Beach buddies: One of the priorities on Coco's list was to spend a day at the beach and run in the sea

Man's best friend: Mr Spencer, from Farnborough, Hampshire, has had Coco since she was nine weeks old. Pictured: Coco as a puppy

'We went to visit my sister in Newcastle and on the way stopped at Code3D in Sheffield, where Coco had a 3D scan done - it took five hours but they sent me an email showing me the model and it looks amazing.

'It all spiralled from there really. That weekend we went to the beach and she had fish and chips, an ice cream and went into the sea which she hasn't done since she was a pup.

'She has really enjoyed it all so far.'

The rottweiler, who has been prescribed painkillers to make her comfortable for the remainder of her life. 

And to complete her list, she just needs to try some sushi and have a cast of her paw print made.

Mr Spencer, who has had Coco since she was a nine-week-old puppy, added: 'She is a beautiful dog.

Helping hand: Mr Spencer gives Coco the rottweiler some help as she prepares to paddle by herself

'Let's say if somebody broke in to steal something, she would probably help to pack the car.

'She's never shown any aggression and just wants attention.

'She will lick you to death and just wants attention, as long as you give her a little love she is happy.'

He added he would love to extend her list to include other items - like meeting a celebrity or going abroad, but fears she is not well enough. 

'I wouldn't want to add something and then not complete it. That would be heartbreaking.

'Theresa and I have been together seven years and I had Coco when we met, she would joke that I loved the dog more than her.'

Ticked off: Mr Spencer says Coco has 'really enjoyed' completing her list. Pictured: the pair in the helicopter

Ready for work: Coco spent a day as a police dog with Miss Clancy, who is a police officer for Surrey Police

Mr Spencer was told he could choose to have Coco's leg amputated and then chemotherapy or to put her down when her condition worsened.

'With Coco's medical history not being great and as with most large dogs, they do not do as well with three legs and she would not have a good quality of life,' he said.

'I asked if we went down that route, how much more time would we give her. The vet said only four to six months.

'I couldn't do that to her, put her through so much for such a short amount of time.

'The other option is to manage her pain and put her down when she needs it. I asked when would I know when it is time and she just said 'you'll know'.'
