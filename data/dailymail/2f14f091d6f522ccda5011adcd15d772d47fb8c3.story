Ant Smith says telling the truth about the size of his manhood was 'liberating'

New statistics reveal that the average sized penis is only 5.16 inches, smaller than originally thought, but what's it like if you don't measure up to the norm?

One man with a with a  small member (only four inches erect) recently blogged about the perils of having a tiny todger - and his post went viral.

Here, writer Ant Smith, a 47-year-old engineering manager from London, explains why he decided to share his vital statistics and explains what it's like to be a few inches short.

'Last year I wrote a poem and blog post about penis size anxiety. It was painfully autobiographical, but the harder it was to write, the more important it seemed to be.

'I'm 48 now, and I've been struggling with this anxiety for decades, even though I'm very happily married. 

'Men have a great capacity for emotional deniability. As long as we're not confronted with our vulnerabilities we can pretend they don't exist.

'It was a drunken evening talking to a new, but good friend, when somehow or other the question of size came up and I admitted I had such worries.

'I was very drunk, and just couldn't face lying once again. To my surprise, he said he did too. A comrade in arms I thought, as we sheepishly swapped statistics - he went first and admitted to only possessing 6". I told him I had 4, and his relief was palpable.

'Telling this truth was truly liberating, and being able to reassure my friend was rewarding. This is when I realised how pervasive, and pointless, size anxiety is. I realised my own perspective could help many others too.

'So I published the blog in the hope that if more smaller guys were open and honest we could establish a more realistic view of what average is - rather than only ever seeing the behemoths that porn and advertising presents to us.

Ant says men should be more open and honest to establish a more realistic view of what average is

'For the next few months I performed the poem at various venues around London. There was always at least one warm handshake afterwards from a guy who seemed particularly glad that I'd openly discussed the question of size, from my perspective.

'Then in September last year the world's media took notice and I found myself giving interviews around the globe. It seems like I'd found some kind of magic formula. A way of talking about the issue that was neither too puerile nor too painful. Suddenly everyone was talking about my small, but perfectly functioning, willy!

'And I was personally responding to thousands of men (by Twitter and e-mail). So much so that it became impossible to keep up. I felt tremendously proud to have achieved this through poetry, to be able to make poetry relevant in the mainstream.

'At this point RiotTV asked if I'd like to make a short documentary - and I thought if I can't reply personally to everyone this was an opportunity to spread my positive take to so many more people.

'With the promise of being able to make something enduring I was able to garner the support to organise The Big Small Penis Party.

'This meant I had to really think through the issues - remember, I'd spent most of my life in denial so this was a journey of discovery for me too.

Ant says he first experienced penis size anxiety while getting changed for sports at school

'First I remembered a time, age 13, in the school changing room putting my shorts on while I was still wearing my long winter coat. I didn't even know what penis size anxiety was then, or why I was doing that, but I did.

'Growing up I realise more girls asked me out than vice versa, I must have been reasonably attractive - but I never knew it.

'By age 18 I was suffering openly from other (young) men laughing at me in the locker room or at the urinal. I became very shy to the extent that I'd find reasons to put off "that first time" with girlfriends that I did have.

'I worked hard and I was successful in every other way, but I had zero self respect. And I was very, very bad at sex. Not at all because of my small member, but because I never dared practice enough and I never believed I could be anything other than abysmal in that department.

'Thankfully, after only 17 years my wife has taught me differently!

'The party was an attempt to head off these, needless, difficulties for others. In and of itself, on the night it certainly worked. We got a great cross section of people attending, including guys of all ages and sizes (we surveyed the audience). 

'I know there were smaller guys there taking a moment of relief. One gentleman travelled from northern Italy specifically for the party. And I heard others talking about how they would never again shout "Small Penis!" when they see particularly bad driving.

'But the party is just the beginning. Already others around the world are asking my advice on how to do something similar, and of course soon we will have the short documentary ready too.

'I do believe, in some small way, The Big Small Penis Party has made the world a little better place.'
