Worrying: A review of France's state finances - requested by President Francois Hollande - has revealed a massive £27billion shortfall in its economy, threatening the country's deficit goals

New French President Francois Hollande – elected on an anti-austerity platform – was yesterday told 'unprecedented' cuts were needed to plug a gaping hole in the country's budget.

France's accounting watchdog warned the government needs to find £35billion in savings over the next two years to drag it out of the 'danger zone'.

Didier Migaud, head of the country's Cour des Comptes audit body, said repairing the battered public finances was 'crucial' and must not be delayed.

'It will require an unprecedented brake on spending and higher taxes,' he said.

The tough message was a blow to socialist Mr Hollande, who declared that 'austerity can no longer be inevitable' after he defeated Nicolas Sarkozy in May and has repeatedly called for Europe to focus on growth.

France, which has lost its AAA credit rating, ran up a deficit of £83billion last year – or more than five per cent of GDP – and its £1.4trillion debt amounts to £50,000 per household, or 86 per cent of GDP.

The auditor said savings of up to £8billion were needed this year and a further £27billion next year to get the deficit under control and meet Mr Hollande's budget target of cutting it to three per cent of GDP next year and eliminating it in 2017.

Mr Migaud warned action must be taken now to prevent a backlash on the financial markets and a possible bailout.

French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault will outline the socialist's economic plan today and finance minister Pierre Moscovici will publish details of a revised budget tomorrow.

'There will be tax increases, there will be spending cuts,' Mr Moscovici admitted last week. 'But we must avoid a budget that hurts economic activity.'

Mr Hollande's task will be made even more difficult by weak economic growth. The auditor forecast expansion of 0.4 per cent this year and one per cent in 2013.

Hollande's approval rating has already slid by seven points to around 51 per cent as the public fears more economic gloom.

The government will revise down official growth forecasts as it uses the audit to rework the 2012 budget, Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said in a newspaper interview.

The Court of Auditors-- a quasi-judicial body responsible for overseeing public accounts - said it had not uncovered any new skeletons left by the outgoing government of conservative former President Nicolas Sarkozy.

It pointed to 1.2 to 2.0 billion euros of likely overspending this year in areas like defence, agriculture and housing, but said this was normal.

The main obstacle to Hollande's 
pledge to honour France's European Union deficit targets of 4.5 per cent
of GDP this year and 3.0 per cent in 2013, the court said, was a 
revenue shortfall due to over optimistic assumptions on economic growth.

The
crunch year for public finances would come in 2013, the auditors said, 
when the government must make the biggest step in deficit reduction in 
the face of weak growth, a persistent euro zone crisis and rising 
domestic anger over high unemployment.

'Respecting
the 2013 public finance target is particularly important for France's 
credibility with the euro zone gravely affected by a debt crisis,' the 
report said.

Even if Paris 
meets this year's target, public debt is on course to top the 90 per 
cent of GDP level at which economists see a negative impact on growth, 
making it vital that the government act quickly.

'If the dynamic of public debt does 
not slow, the risk premium demanded by investors will raise debt 
servicing costs and limit still further the room for manoeuvre,' it 
said.

Government 
sources have already said that a revised 2012 budget, due before the 
cabinet on Wednesday, will include some 7.5 billion euros in new taxes, 
including increases in wealth tax and a financial transactions tax.

But
the auditor's report will strengthen the case for tough spending and 
tax measures in the 2013 budget, due in the autumn, potentially helping 
the government face down opposition from powerful trade unions and its 
own far-left political allies.

The
Court of Auditors said growth this year would be around 0.4 per cent, 
less than the 0.7 per cent assumption in the old budget.

For 2013, the auditors assumed growth of 1 per cent, well shy of the previous government's 1.75 per cent forecast.

The new government appeared to agree. 
Moscovici told Le Figaro he would base a 2012 corrective budget on a 
growth forecast of 0.4 per cent or less, and the 2013 plan on output 
expansion of 1.0 to 1.3 per cent.

While neighbouring Germany was starting to reduce its debt, France's was still climbing, draining the competitiveness of its economy, the court said. 

France urgently needed to rein in one of the highest state spending levels in Europe, at 56 per cent of GDP.

'Budgetary adjustments should be aimed mainly at spending,' the report said, noting that efficiency gains would allow this to be done without affecting the quality of services.

It said job cuts were indispensable to curb mounting payroll costs.

The
Court of Auditors is headed by Didier Migaud, a former Socialist 
politician appointed by Sarkozy, giving its recommendations bipartisan 
authority. 

In the short 
term, the auditors accepted that tax rises were needed to avoid drastic 
spending cuts which would choke off a recovery.

They recommended reductions to tax exemptions and a short-term increase in Value-Added Tax and the CSG welfare charge.

The court report did not take into 
account measures approved by the government since it took office in May,
including a two percent rise in the minimum wage.

Its figures also did not include a recent EU decision on taxation of foreign investment funds, which could cost France up to 9 billion euros, nor the extra cost of France's share in a 100 billion euro zone bailout for Spanish banks, agreed last month.

If the 33 billion euros next year were split evenly between spending reductions and new taxes, the government could find the 16.5 billion euros of expenditure savings by slowing state spending increases to the pace of inflation, the auditors said.

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, due to set out his legislative agenda to parliament on Tuesday, has said the central government - which accounts for four-fifths of the deficit - would hold spending flat between 2013 and 2015.
