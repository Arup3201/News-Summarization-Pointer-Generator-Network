Paul Pogba spoke to Sportsmail about winning the Serie A title with Juventus, the difficult time he endured during his spell at Manchester United and his dream to play in the World Cup with his twin brothers...

Who is your sporting hero?

I am lucky that I get to play with my hero - Andrea Pirlo. I make no secret I want to become like him. He has won everything, and he has won it playing such an important role.

Hero: Pogba makes no secret of the fact he wants to play like Andrea Pirlo as he progresses in the game

What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman?

Because of the age I started playing I have never thought about that question, and as I am about to go and play in a World Cup I am glad that I have never had to think about that question.

Career highlight?

I can’t choose between the two league titles with Juventus and winning my first international cap forFrance. They were both very special.

... and the worst moment?

My time at Manchester United. Of course when you are at such a big club you understand you need to be patient for your chance, but I did not feel respected or valued as a player or a man.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

I know it is an obvious answer, but just my family. I don’t have one material possession that means that much to me.

Struggle: Pogba did not feel respected or valued during his time as a Manchester United player

Favourite song?

Anything by Kanye West or Jay Z. Not just because they make good music - but they are an inspiration for young black men all over the world.

Inspiration: Pogba is a fan of American rapper Jay Z

What is the one programme on TV you can’t miss?

I prefer to play video games, but I do like to watch the highlights from the NBA.

Last film you saw?

The Wolf Of Wall Street and it was incredible.

If you could have dinner with three famous people, who would they be?

Zinedine Zidane, Jay Z, and Usain Bolt.

Can you cook? Best dish?

I can do easy things like pasta with chicken or pasta with fish, but in Italy you just need to walk out the door and you can have the best pasta in the world cooked for you.

Your favourite holiday destination?

I like to be where it is warm and have got even more used to the heat being in Italy, so I would choose somewhere like Miami Beach.

In a film of your life, who would you like to play you?

A young Will Smith would be a great honour.

Tell us a secret...

Both of my twin brothers represent the Guinea national team. It is my dream that one day they reach the World Cup and draw France - so that we can all play on the same field at the World Cup.
