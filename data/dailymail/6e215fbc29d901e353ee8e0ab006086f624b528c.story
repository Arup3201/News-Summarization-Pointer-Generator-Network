Beyond the fridge full of Spanish ham in his office, the enduring memory of an hour or so in the company of Roberto Martinez this time last year was the clarity of his thought and the freshness of his ideas.

Even when it came to his diet, he appeared to have a unique recipe for success. He would eat carbohydrates in the evening to fuel the brain because he liked to do much of his thinking at night. But he would eat nothing immediately before a game because he wanted the blood in his brain rather than in his stomach when providing direction from the technical area.

It was an interview from which you emerged feeling educated. You could see, 22 Premier League games into his tenure at Everton, why his side were reflecting on just two defeats. His attention to detail, even in this era of a more scientific approach to sport, was impressive.

Staff at the club’s Finch Farm training ground appeared to be in awe of their Catalan leader. Understandably, they had been unsettled by the departure of David Moyes but Martinez had made the transition easier than they had perhaps feared, employing charm, charisma and drive to get everyone, from the star players to the secretaries, buying into his regime.

Today, the majority of players at Everton continue to like Martinez’s style as manager. One senior dressing room source described him this week as a ‘courageous, tactically astute coach’ who encourages them to fear no-one. They have found his approach to the bigger games particularly refreshing. Martinez sends them out to play with ambition rather than inhibition.

But something has changed for the worse in Martinez’s second season in charge, as nine defeats in their first 22 games demonstrated prior to a much-needed victory at Crystal Palace last weekend.

‘There is a danger they are turning into his Wigan team,’ said another qualified observer, and while that might seem harsh, the 34 league goals they have so far conceded amounts to the joint-fifth worst defensive record in the top flight.

This week Martinez shared his thoughts on why, pointing to the additional burden of European football and the number of injuries. ‘Remember we had a player in Leon Osman last season who played in every game,’ he said before also pointing to the absence of Steven Pienaar and James McCarthy, among others.

Some point to a deeper problem, however: to the impact the departure of certain staff has had on dressing room, and club, morale.

In that same interview last year, Martinez said ‘he wanted to change things without losing anything’ in recognition of the club Moyes had so successfully created.

But some changes have been regarded by some as heavy losses. Danny Donachie resigned as head of medicine in December, while conditioning coach Steve Tashjian left in the summer and another fitness coach, Dave Billows, before that.

There is nothing new in a manager bringing in his own staff but these three particular members of the backroom staff were regarded by many as the oil in the machine. ‘They were very popular with the players, and trusted,’ said one dressing room source. ‘They would keep the ship sailing.’

A physiotherapist who had been at Goodison Park for more than a decade, Donachie is the son of former assistant manager Willie and regarded as something of an innovator when it comes to the management of injuries. But it seems he may have clashed with Martinez, himself a qualified physiotherapist, over the treatment of injuries, which may have led to his departure.

Donachie alluded to as much in an interview he gave to a professional publication last season.

‘It’s not inconceivable to find yourself in a position where the athlete and the coaching staff are desperate to play in the next game and you know it’s not in their best interest,’ said Donachie. ‘This is when your communication skills come into play, by convincing the management it is the best thing for the player and hence the team and explain and cajole the player into preparing for the more sensible option.’ Donachie is currently on gardening leave but is sure to be in demand.

Much has been made of Everton’s injury record since Martinez took charge, in particular the 18 hamstring injuries in his first 18 months in charge.

Sportsmail examined the club’s injury record in more detail and can report that in Martinez’s 20 months in charge there have been 105 injuries, 85 of them to key players. Compare that to the last 20 months of Moyes’s tenure: 93 injuries with 60 to key players. Not a huge difference, but a rise all the same.

One reason being given is ‘too much ball work’ which probably demands medical expertise to explain but appears to suggest Martinez believes in certain training methods that place the body under more stress than it is used to.

There are other issues that often arise when a team is not getting results: claims of unhappy senior players and personality clashes. Samuel Eto’o, who was at the club for only the briefest of spells, is understood to have been a central figure in training ground disputes.

Concerns have been raised over the players’ fitness. Once a strength of Everton teams driven hard by Moyes, there have been times this season when the same players have looked sluggish and heavy-legged.

Some blame it on a softening of the spirit, on Martinez’s failure to take the appropriate action when there has been a dip in standards.

Martinez always seems keen to see the positive in everything. Only this week he insisted he saw ‘a focused face’ in that rather amusing photograph of Aaron Lennon when everyone else saw a player seemingly unhappy to be on loan in the north west of England.

It is said to frustrate some players that Martinez is too soft when the misfiring team is crying out for the tough discipline his predecessor used to administer. ‘The team had a fighting spirit that seems to have disappeared,’ said one insider.

And yet here’s the thing. Players supposedly wanting Martinez to get tough were then heard to complain about a training trip to Qatar last week. It was all work and no play. Double sessions. No real down time. ‘Boring,’ was one verdict, even if it was followed by that win at Selhurst Park.

The players were said to be less offended than they perhaps should have been when Kevin Mirallas decided to relieve Leighton Baines of the penalty-taking duties against West Brom last month, only to miss.

But it was also noted that Martinez did not confront Mirallas at half-time, mainly because the Belgian forward never appeared in the dressing room having instead dived into the treatment room and declared himself unfit to play the second half.

Given the opportunity to respond this week, Martinez rejected the idea that changes in the backroom staff were to blame for what has been a disappointing campaign, one that he hopes will finally take off against Liverpool on Saturday.

‘No, no, not at all, no,’ he said in response to a question about Donachie and his colleagues. ‘It has been more in the playing staff if anything. I don’t think the staff changes have affected us.

‘Danny (Donachie) had a terrific time with Everton and when you make your own decision you’re not pushed away. When you make your own decision it is probably the best for everyone as it means you are not enjoying what you do. I don’t think it has had an effect on the team at all, not on the performance of the team.’

David Moyes was renowned for his tough discipline during his time as Everton manager

And he might be right. It might be a wider issue. It might be a broad spectrum of issues that a manager encounters when he succeeds a long-serving, successful manager, in particular once he starts making changes to a professional environment that the players had grown used to.

It might be that Martinez is now enduring the sort of difficulties Moyes encountered at Manchester United, and which Louis van Gaal is encountering now.

It might be that not until Everton have emerged from transition, and Martinez has things exactly how he wants them, will they perform with the consistency they achieved under Moyes.

When Martinez moved into Finch Farm he had a wall on one staircase decorated with photographs of the club’s glory days, leaving a blank space for what he hoped would be the second FA Cup triumph of his career.

Now it seems likely to remain blank for a while, however clear an idea Martinez might have of what happens next.
