The only copy of a historic Mary Pickford movie from 1911 has been discovered by a carpenter in an old New Hampshire barn.

The silent film, called 'Their First Misunderstanding' marks a watershed period in cinematic history and also in the life of the pioneering actress.

The moving picture is the first one that Pickford, who went on to be known as 'America's Sweetheart', wrote
 and the first for which she was given credit in the advertising 
materials.

Clout: By the time Pickford has ascended from child star to Hollywood legend she has changed the way that actors and actresses were paid, credited and offered contracts by the major film studios in the America

Before that, movie studios didn't want actors or actresses to become 
household names because they would demand more money.

Woodworker Peter Massie discovered the film along with six other vintage reels in a barn he was tearing down.

The property where he found the 
films used to be a summer camp for boys, and the movies were 
probably shown to entertain the campers.

Child star: Film bosses wanted to keep Hollywood star's from becoming household names, meaning Pickford for many of her early performances was simply credited as 'the girl with the curls'

Famous faces: Pickford defied the convention that screen sirens should not divorce when she split from her first two husbands before marrying fellow screen star Charles 'Buddy' Rogers, above

Massie donated the films to a Keene State College where it was identified.

After handing over the reels, he said: 'This is the coolest thing I've ever found on any job.'

The Library of Congress is now funding the project to restore the film, it will be shown next month at Keene State.

Canadian born Pickford was a co-founder of the United Artists film studio and helped establish the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

She retired from acting in 1933 and died in 1979.

The 10-minute comedy-drama stars Pickford and her first husband, Owen Moore, as newlyweds having their first argument.

Larry Benaquist, who led the prohect to restore the reels, discovered that the first minute of the film was destroyed, but the rest was in remarkably good condition.

Until 'Their First Misunderstanding' Pickford had been known only as 'Little Mary', 'The Girl with the Curls' and 'The Biograph' girl, after her former studio.

But that changed after this film after when demanded to be credited for her work.

Benaquist, film program founder at Keene State College, said 'Now she was an actor with clout, and I think she used that to great advantage.'
