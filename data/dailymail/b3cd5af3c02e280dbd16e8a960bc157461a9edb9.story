A mother-of-two whose quest for the perfect bottom led to a quadruple limb and buttock amputation has warned other women against black market silicone injections.

Hair stylist Apryl Michelle Brown, from LA, spent five years in excruciating pain when an unlicensed practitioner injected her buttocks with bathroom sealant, telling her it was silicone, in order to enhance them.

Doctors had no idea how to treat the botched implants and told her she might have to live with the agony, but when they finally operated the injections became so badly infected she was induced into a coma.

It was only when she awoke two months later that Apryl, now 46, discovered the lengths medical staff had gone to to keep her alive.

Speaking on to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langford ITV's This Morning via satellite link, Apryl explained that as a child she had been teased for having a 'flat butt' and developed a complex, so when a woman came into her salon in 2004 saying she had had silicone injections, Apryl thought she had been 'sent from God'.

She said: 'I thought she was a blessing. I hadn't done any other research so I didn't know all the horror stories. I went to someone's private home - she wasn't licensed, but I didn't know that then - and lay on her daughter's bed, wearing special panties with the butt removed.

'She told me I'd need four sets of injections, and when she started to do them it was very painful. I could feel it going into my nerves and muscles.'

The pain did subside, and Apryl returned for a second lot of injections. It was as she left the house the second time that she had 'an epiphany'.

'I thought, what are you doing? And that was a sign from God to stop.'

Soon after, things began to go dramatically wrong.

First the area around the injections began to discolour, then become itchy, then incredibly painful, described by Apryl as 'like a toothache, labour pain and a migraine'.

She sought medical advice and the general consensus was that doctors had no idea what to do. Most told her the chemical could not be removed and that she would have to live with the pain.

'Eventually they went in and removed the silicone, along with the butt cheeks,' said Apryl. 'It was then it became infected and they gave me 24 hours to live. I remember feeling relieved when I heard that.'

Doctors induced Apryl into a coma and carried out 27 operations, including a buttock amputation and a quadruple lower arm and lower leg amputation. 'I didn't know this until I came around,' she said. 'When I woke up I had no butt and I wasn't in pain anymore.'

Apryl said: 'When I got the injections I already had great self esteem. I thought I was just enhancing myself. But looking back, I see there must have been an extreme issue'

Apryl, who recently completed a three-mile walk, 10-mile cycle and 150m swim for charity, said she wishes to use the experience to teach other women about the dangers of vanity.

She said: 'I don't think God gives you opportunity to live again without using it to stop others. I want to teach that we mustn't ever look for something outside ourselves to validate ourselves.

'We're already born whole and perfect and complete, and nothing we do on the outside will make us change on the inside.

'When I got the injections I already had great self esteem. I thought I was just enhancing myself. But looking back, I see there must have been an extreme issue.'

A British student died after 
jetting to America for an illegal 'butt enhancement' operation in the hopes that having a shapelier backside would make her a hip-hop star.

Claudia
Aderotimi, 20, believed a 'bigger booty' would help in her quest to 
appear in more music videos, her distraught friends claimed following her death in February 2011.

One
even revealed the aspiring dancer - stagename Carmella London - was 
dropped from one shoot because directors discovered she had been wearing
padded trousers to help enlarge her bottom.

Talent
scout Tee Ali, who met the university student when she filmed a video, 
told The Sun: 'She was a dancer and choreographer.

'The problem was she didn't have no butt, and she wanted a butt.

'She went to audition for one video shoot wearing fake booty pants and she got all the attention.

'But when they found out it was fake she didn't get asked back.'

He described her as 'victim' of social pressure to be perfect and thought a larger bottom would make her famous.'

The Thames Valley University student 
developed chest pains and struggled for breath 12 hours after she had 
the illegal silicone injections at a budget hotel.

She was taken to hospital but could not be saved.

A preliminary examination found the silicone filler had leaked into her bloodstream, leading to heart failure.

American
detectives are investigating whether she was treated with cheap 
‘industrial’ silicone, normally used as a sealant, rather than 
medical-grade material used in breast implant surgery.

enlarge her bottom.

It was not the first time Miss Aderotimi had had the procedure.

She is believed to have been treated in November 2010 - her 2011 injection may have been a 'top-up' procedure.

Accompanied by three friends, she 
travelled from London to Philadelphia for the treatment, thought to have
been an early present to herself for her 21st birthday

Bootylicious: Nicki Minaj has become almost as famous for her posterior as for her voice

But a day later she was dead.

Buttock enhancement surgery is 
becoming popular in the U.S., among women who aspire to the shapely 
curves of Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and singer Nicki Minaj.

Minaj has become almost as famous for
her posterior as for her voice, and rumours have spread across the web 
that the Massive Attack singer underwent surgery or uses pads to boost 
her bum, especially on urban gossip sites such as Bossip and 
mediatakeout.com. She, however denies having had surgery.

The illusion of a larger backside has
become increasingly more fashionable among young women since the rise 
of the 'Hip Hop Honey' phenomenon.

A bigger behind has become almost a prerequisite for any aspiring dancer wanting to make it on the music video scene.

But the hip hop industry has come under 
fire for objectifying women in music videos where dancers - or Hip Hop 
Honeys - chasing fame can often leave themselves open to financial and 
sexual exploitation.

And in their desperation to beat off the competition, many resort to surgery to get ahead.

'Top up' procedures are only legal when the silicone 
gel is contained and sealed within an implant. But illegal injections of 
the material are also widely available from unlicensed back-room medics.

One expert said having a 
direct injection of silicone gel - long outlawed in the U.S. and 
Britain, even for breast surgery - is 'like playing Russian roulette'.

Miss Aderotimi and her friends flew to Philadelphia and paid around £100 for the room.

Miss Aderotimi's buttock 
injections are  thought to have cost around £1,300 - while her 
friend had the same procedure along with a hip enhancement treatment.

The 'doctor' who injected the silicone left soon after and was not there when Miss Aderotimi began complaining of chest pains.

Paramedics were called to the hotel 
and she was taken to Mercy Fitzgerald hospital where she died 90 minutes
after being admitted.

Dr Rajiv Grover, president-elect of 
the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘Buttock 
augmentation isn’t a very commonly done procedure here, which is 
probably why these girls have resorted to going abroad.

'If correctly 
done, it involves implanting solid silicone implants into the buttock 
just like breast implants.

Paul Harris, consultant plastic surgeon at the Royal Marsden hospital in London, warned against going overseas for such treatments

Young women are taking enormous risks in pursuit of a smoother, rounder bottom, an expert said.

Paul Harris, consultant plastic surgeon at the Royal Marsden hospital in London, warned against going overseas for such treatments.

'Bottom augmentation is becoming more popular and originated in South America, in places like Brazil,' he said.

'More and more people are coming forward in the UK for this procedure.' a

A former Miss Argentina, Solange Magnano, died at 38 in 2010 after a buttocks-enhancement procedure at a medical clinic in Buenos Aires.

Mr Harris said he had dealt with two patients who suffered problems after receiving silicone jabs overseas.

'The problems are two fold,' he said. 'Firstly, if you use a low volume amount of silicone it can promote rejection - the body trying to ward it off. That causes a long-term abscess which can damage the surrounding tissue.

'Elsewhere in the world it has been reported to cause problems with pulmonary embolism, a blood clot to the lungs, which may have happened in this most recent case.'

The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery says the safety of the use of liquid injectable silicone for cosmetic purposes is controversial, and should not be used outside legitimately approved clinical trials.
