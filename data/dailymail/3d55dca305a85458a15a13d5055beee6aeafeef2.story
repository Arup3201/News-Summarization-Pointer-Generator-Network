A young music fan who died from cancer in 2010 has been chosen to appear on the cover of a record by her favourite band Florence and the Machine.

Natalie Roberts was a teenager when she was diagnosed with the rare form of cancer, Ewing’s Sarcoma, and died in 2010, aged just 20.

The youngster from Alexandria in Scotland had been a huge fan of Florence and the Machine, using their music as a form of therapy during her illness.

To mark a year since her passing, best pal Louise Clifford, painted a watercolour portrait of her friend that is now to feature on the cover of a special seven-inch vinyl Florence and the Machine track.

Louise, 22, said: 'I had drawn the 
portrait of Natalie a while ago for her mum. I just missed her, but 
didn’t know how to express it, so I thought I’d do this.'

Louise
saw a competition on Twitter, organised by the Teenage Cancer Trust, 
asking entrants to draw a picture to feature on the vinyl cover of a 
track by the charity’s patron, Florence and the Machine.

Florence and the Machine are to re-release a limited edition vinyl version of their single, Only if for a Night.

She said: 'Her mum was over the moon with it and when I read about the competition it all seemed to fit in.

'The drawing I’d done linked in with the Florence and the Machine lyrics really well.

'The
song is all about a celestial being - someone who’s passed away - and 
Florence felt inspired by them in the same way I was inspired by 
Natalie.

'It is fitting for her to be celebrated on a record cover for an artist she loved.'

In 2009, Natalie spent a day with Florence and the Machine at the Royal Albert Hall as part of a Teenage Cancer Trust event.

Louise recalls Natalie telling her how 'Florence was dead down to earth and just really normal'.

Natalie’s mum, Heather Roberts, said: 'As soon as Florence and the Machine came out, Natalie loved her.

'All the time she was in hospital she had her iPod and her charger with her. Florence’s music really sustained her during those times.

'Having this artwork on the record is like giving Natalie a great big present, even though she’s not here to see it.

'It’s also given me so much comfort. The artwork is so beautiful and is based on a picture of Natalie at a christening.

'When I saw it I was so proud, just over the moon that one of her friends would take the time to do that for me.'

Louise heard the news last week that her portrait has been the most voted for piece in the competition.

She said: 'It’s really gratifying to see so much support. Everyone I know was getting everyone to vote and it was a great feeling to know they cared.'
