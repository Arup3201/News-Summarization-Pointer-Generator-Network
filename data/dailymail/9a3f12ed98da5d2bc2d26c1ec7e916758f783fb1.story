A teenager who stabbed a ticket inspector in an 'appalling' attack to avoid paying a £5 rail fare has been jailed for four years.

Robert Culley, 17,  lunged at his victim 'like an animal' before plunging a knife into his armpit on a London-bound train in December last year.

His older brother, Charles Culley, 19, then punched a second rail worker who had attempted to stop the attack.

The pair had launched a violent and unprovoked assault after they were asked for their tickets on an evening train from Southend Central to London Fenchurch Street.

The brothers fled the scene as the c2c train pulled into East Tilbury station in Essex.

They were later identified through a national media appeal using CCTV images from the station released by British Transport Police.

The fare for their journey would have been less than £5 each for teenagers using a 16-25 Railcard.

Robert Culley, from Tilbury, Essex, pleaded guilty to wounding and possession of a bladed article at Basildon Crown Court yesterday and was jailed for four years. 

His brother Charles, also from Tilbury, received a four-month detention and training order after pleading guilty to common assault.

The ticket inspector - who has since recovered from his injuries and has returned to work following the attack at 8.20pm on December 16 last year - says he feels sorry for his attacker.

The inspector, who asked not to be identified, said: 'I have children his age so, to be honest, I feel sorry for him and sad he has wasted his life.

'When he gets out no one is going to want to employ him. I feel it is a complete waste of a life.'

Detective Constable David Bishop said: 'Attacks of this nature on rail staff are rare, but we take them all extremely seriously.

'This was an appalling and disgraceful attack on two men who was simply doing their job and who had quite rightly asked the brothers to leave the train.'

Security on trains in the area has since been stepped up with added enforcement officers on evening and late-night routes.

Julian Drury, c2c managing director, said: 'This was an isolated and unprovoked attack on our staff, who were doing their duty making sure the railway is safe for customers, and we are pleased to see those responsible brought to justice.

'We are absolutely determined to make sure the railway is welcoming and safe for all.'
