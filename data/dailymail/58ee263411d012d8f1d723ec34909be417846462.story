An ambitious £1.1m overhaul of London's transport infrastructure will see dozens of underground and bus stations converted into tourist attractions, luxury apartments and new homes.

The ten-year project will see 50 sites owned by Transport for London turned into profit-generating businesses, as they become home to supermarkets, restaurants and even 'click and collect' depots for online retailers. 

The move, which will involve some 10million sq ft of land, will mean the organisation receives an regular income from its huge property portfolio, said to be one of the largest and most valuable in the capital.

A £1.1m project due to be launched on Monday will see dozens of underground and bus stations, including land around Oxford Circus (pictured), potentially become home to tourist attractions and luxury apartments

The original Hyde Park Corner station (pictured), opened in 1906, is now used as a pizza restaurant. Some of the buildings used in the programme will be listed but could be reformed in a similar way

It will also help to reduce travel fares, while also improving transport for London's ever-increasing population, according to London Mayor Boris Johnson. 

The one-year tender process is due to start on Monday, when the organisation will appoint a small number of property development partners to begin work on the overall collection of sites, several of which are home to listed buildings. 

The project is part of wider programme to generate £3.4bn in non fare revenue - including property, advertising and sponsorship - for the organisation over the next ten years.

TfL currently has a 5,700 acre property portfolio, including buildings and land attached to tube stations, railways and highways. Two-thirds of its property estate is located in zones 1 and 2.

Although TfL is not publicly announcing which stations are among the 50 sites, the plan is said to only include tube stations which are currently in use, some bus stations and land above and around various underground stations.

Planning for the renovation of South Kensington tube and Northwood station is already underway, while the land above Oxford Circus tube station, of which TfL owns the freehold, could also be part of the plan.

TfL has some of the most iconic and valuable assets in London with the majority of its property portfolio in the heart of the city.

Previously, TfL sold assets and properties it no longer needed. But it says it has recently decided to retain and invest in its number of sites to generate profit. 

It has already started using some of the stations in this way, with space under Clapham North Tube now used by herb farmers.

It has also introduced a collection of pop-up shops at some stations, while Argos launched its first underground store at London's Cannon Street Tube station last year.

The move, which will involve some 10million sq ft of land, possibly includer Northwood station in north west London (pictured), will mean the organisation receives an regular income from its huge property portfolio

Bond Street station is home to a vast shopping mall, while a property partnership was created last year for the Earl's Court development, which saw TfL merge its freehold of Earl's Court 1 and 2 with developers Capital and Counties.

The original Hyde Park Corner station, one of the more stylish underground station buildings, is also now used as a pizza restaurant.  

There are also plans in place with supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco to provide a click and collect grocery service for commuters.   

Graeme Craig, TfL's Director of Commercial Development, said the move was essential to ensure the transport network could cope with the expected rise in the capital's population.

He said: 'London's population is set to grow from 8.4m today to 10m by 2030, the equivalent of one full Tube train arriving every three days.

The programme will include projects similar to that carry out at Bond Street station, now home to a vast shopping mall (pictured)

'To enable this, London needs more homes and office spaces and the transport network needs sustained, long-term investment.

'Forming joint venture partnerships with property development experts will enable us to generate long-term income that we can invest in improving our network, which carries over 30 million journeys every day.'

He added: 'We will be launching a tender process in the coming weeks to identify the best organisations in the world that will help us to achieve this.'  

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'TfL's role is to look to the future, ensuring that transport continues to support jobs, homes and economic growth across the capital and the UK. The ambitious plans to redevelop some of TfL's land and assets presents a fantastic opportunity to support this important work and ensure public land creates homes for Londoners.'

To launch the tender, TfL has formed a new non-executive property advisory group, which will be headed by Francis Salway, former Chief Executive of Land Securities Group Plc.
