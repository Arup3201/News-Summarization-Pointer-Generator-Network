Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp analyses Germany's extra-time win against Argentina in the World Cup final, including Lionel Messi's performance, Christoph Kramer's forgettable night and another midfield masterclass from Javier Mascherano.

Parking the bus? Not a chance

The match was a real battle of styles. The Argentines were happy to soak up the pressure, defend aggressively and play on the counter attack.

They were not parking the bus, with Gonzalo Higuain, Lionel Messi and Ezequiel Lavezzi up front they always knew one flash could unlock their opponents.

The Germans, on the other hand, were a mixture of tiki-taka and power, looking to score from a 30-pass move or a corner. They dominated possession, but Argentina often looked not far from a goal.

Argentina looked more tired than their opponents. It could have been because they had a day less to prepare, were taken to extra time and penalties in the semi-final whereas the Germans cruised through against Brazil.

It had a real impact on how the game played out and made for a thrilling match.

Kramer has a real stunner

World Cup finals are the biggest stage of all and it creates nervy games.

Five of the last seven have been goalless at half-time and this one was no different.

What a night to remember for Christoph Kramer â€” if he can recall any of it.

The 23-year-old was called up for his first competitive start for Germany after Sami Khedira pulled out with a calf injury in the warm-up.

Kramer had made just two last-minute substitute appearances against Algeria in the last 16 and France in the quarter-final. It was such a shame, then, that he took a blow to the face in the 20th minute as the full force of Garay ran through him when he was looking the other way and eventually had to come off after 32 minutes.

He looked dazed and confused when he left the field with concussion.

Mascherano the middle man

Javier Mascherano has proven at this World Cup that he is a midfielder and not a defender. Why on earth do Barcelona play him as a centre back?

He is not tall enough for the position and it does not suit him. But when Mascherano is in midfield he is a different animal.

As soon as the team loses the ball he slips into the defence, he can sense danger and he can deal with it.

In the semi-final he made the tackle of the tournament against Arjen Robben, who looked set to score the goal which would have knocked Argentina out, and he was a nuisance for Germany again.

Pain for Higuain

I would normally have put my life savings on Gonzalo Higuain to score when he was handed a gift of a chance in the first half. After all the goals he has scored for Napoli and Argentina he looked certain to find the net.

He had so much time when Toni Kroos headed the ball right into his path but he just snatched at it.

It just goes to show what happens to players when they are under that much pressure.

Messi saves best till last

Lionel Messi had clearly stored up something extra for this final. He showed the pace and sharpness that he has lacked in the past few matches.

He gave Mats Hummels a torrid time, picking the ball up on the right flank and dribbling with a spring in his step.

Hummels has been one of the standout defenders but Messi left him for dead in the first half with a rapid change of pace and was unlucky not to find a team-mate when he got to the byline.
