Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal has gotten most of the attention from the document hack

Sony Pictures is going on the offensive against news outlets that are publishing details of tens of thousands of hacked emails that have embarrassed the company.  

Lawyers for the film studio sent out letters to media companies that have reported on the contents of the hacked emails. The letters state that the data was stolen from Sony Pictures and ask that media outlets destroy any of the documents that they may posses.

The vast troves of data are slowly being released online by hackers calling themselves the 'Guardians of Peace.' The documents are widely available on peer-to-peer file sharing sites online. It is widely believed that North Korea is behind the hack attack.

'(Sony Pictures Entertainment) does not consent to your possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading, or making any use of the Stolen Information, and to request your cooperation in destroying the Stolen Information,' reads a letter from David Boies - the star attorney hired by Sony Pictures.

The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter, Variety and Gawker Media published stories reporting that they had each received a letter
from David Boies, an attorney for Sony, demanding that the
outlets stop reporting information contained in the documents
and immediately destroy them.

MailOnline has not received a legal warning from Sony over the hacked documents.    

A spokesman for Boies confirmed he sent a letter to certain
media outlets on behalf of Sony but declined to discuss details.

Disclosures from the internal documents have caused turmoil
at the studio, a unit of Japan's Sony Corp, and shed
light on internal discussions key to the company's future. 

One theory behind the cyberattack is that it was directed by North Korean sympathizers - or the government itself - as a result of 'The Interview,' which features the assassination of Kim Jong-un

For
instance, the unidentified hackers have released troves of
documents that include employee salaries and financial
information, marketing plans and contracts with business
partners.

In addition, the documents that have emerged included an
exchange in which Co-Chairman Amy Pascal joked about President
Barack Obama's race. After media outlets reported that, Pascal
subsequently issued a public apology for 'insensitive and
inappropriate' emails.

Pascal is scheduled to meet this week with civil rights
leader Reverend Al Sharpton, whose spokeswoman says he is
weighing whether to call for her resignation. 
Pascal did not respond to a request for comment, and a Sony
spokeswoman declined to comment on Pascal's future.

Sony, in a memo to staff on December 2,
acknowledged that a large amount of data was stolen by the
hackers but has declined to confirm specific documents.

Over the weekend, a message claiming to be from the
Guardians of Peace, a group that says it carried out the cyber
attack on Sony, warned of additional disclosures.

'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift,' said the
message posted on a site for sharing files called Pastebin. 'The
gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more
interesting.'
