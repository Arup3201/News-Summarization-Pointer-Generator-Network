A Virginia high school administrator spoke out Thursday about her racially charged retweet that sparked a student protest this week and caused her to be placed on leave.

Booker T. Washington High School Assistant Principal Amy Strickland released a statement to WAVY-TV saying that she is currently on leave after acknowledging that she retweeted an image that prompted a group of students to walk out of class Monday.

Ms Strickland, a mother of two, responded Thursday to the uproar over a June post that had appeared on the satirical Twitter account ‘OrNahhTweets.’ 

'Media reports suggesting that I am racially prejudiced are one thousand percent false, as my record and my many students, colleagues, friends, and family members who are African American can and, if necessary, will attest,' she stated. 'I deeply apologize to anyone I have inadvertently offended.'

Viral image: Photo of seven interracial prom couples was retweeted by Strickland back in June, but it has gone viral only recently. The educator explained that she shared the picture with her daughter because the teen had had a black prom date herself

The image at the center of the controversy depicted seven couples in prom clothing, the boys black, the girls white, with the caption, "Every white girl's father's worst nightmare Or Nah?"

Strickland told WAVY-TV through her lawyer that she forwarded the tweet to one of her daughters as a joke and never interpreted it as racist.

Strickland noted that both of her daughters went to prom with black dates. 

'The "tweet" appeared to me at the time to have been an attempt at good natured humor concerning mixed race couples attending a high school prom,' she wrote.

'I have devoted years of my life to educating students in a predominantly African American school and was named Teacher of the Year for the predominantly African American Portsmouth school system last year.

'Partly because of my exemplary record of working well and achieving success in an urban school system, I was hired this fall as Assistant Principal at Booker T. Washington.'

Amy Strickland revealed also in her statement Thursday that she is currently on administrative leave. 

The educator pointed out through her attorney that she issued the statement as an individual, not as an employee of Booker T. Washington High School.

The school administration reportedly has banned Strickland for talking to the press. 

The NAACP, which has launched an investigation into the matter, responded to Strickland's statement saying that the organization is not calling her racist, but they want to know what motivated her to retweet the picture.

'We hold the administration accountable for their actions. We will not tolerate racism in this city and definitely not in the education system,' stated NAACP President Joe Dillard.

'Booker T. Washington High School is a fragile school; and the last thing we need in our community are students walking out of school in protest to racist administrators.'

On Monday, about a dozen students at Booker T. Washington High School in Norfolk staged a walk-out to draw attention to the racially charged message sent out by the white educator.  

'I could have been any one of the boys in the picture,' Booker T Washington junior Michael LeMelle, who is African-American, told the station WAVY. 'And I really don’t see myself... as anyone’s worst nightmare.' 

For the past week, students at the school have been sharing among themselves screenshots of the incendiary tweet, which has since been deleted, along with Amy Strickland's account.

Students said that they have appealed to the faculty last week to look into the retweet, but their pleas have fallen on deaf ears. 

Norfolk School Board members told the news station Monday that they were unaware of the tweet until WAVY reached out to them for comment. 

Shakira Harris said that she and her classmates do not necessarily want Strickland fired, but they believe she deserves to be reprimanded for her poor judgement.

‘Do something to let us know it has not gone unnoticed,’ Harris pleaded.

Troubled school: The Norfolk, Virginia, high school lost its accreditation last month over poor test scores and low graduation rates  

Norfolk Federation of Teachers President Thomas Calhoun issued a statement Tuesday taking the school board and the Booker T Washington administration to task for allegedly dragging their feet.

‘Sometimes they seem to be hoping the problem will go away or maybe no one will notice,’ Calhoun wrote. ‘I feel everyone would be better served if they would address issues before the news media, the public, the staff, and the students get involved and form their own opinions of what is going on.’

According to her biography on Booker T Washington High School’s website, Amy Strickland, a graduate of Old Dominion University and Eastern Virginia Medical School, where she earned a Master's degree in public health, was hired as assistant principal earlier this year. 

After working in public health education for several years, Strickland switched gears in 2008 and became a science teacher and cheerleading couch in Portsmouth, where she led her team to 17 Eastern District and Conference titles.

This year, she won three Teacher of The Year awards, including the overall citywide award for Portsmouth. 

The school, named after the legendary 19th century African-American community leader, educator and presidential adviser Booker T Washington, has more than 1,400 students enrolled in 9-12 grades, with 85 per cent of them black.

Last month, Virginia's Board of Education stripped the high school of its accreditation because it has failed to meet state minimum scores on the Standards of Learning tests and graduation rates for the past four years.
