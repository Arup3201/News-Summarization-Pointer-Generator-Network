This is the incredible moment an elephant came to the rescue of one of its babies being attacked by a pack of hyenas.

The elephant is seen charging at the hyenas to ward them off its offspring.

These amazing pictures were captured by American photographer Jayesh Mehta, 47, in the Savuti region of the Chobe National Park in Botswana.

Back off: This is the incredible moment an elephant came to the rescue of one of its babies being attacked by a pack of hyenas

Jayesh said: 'We heard 
cries of elephants in distress. On leaving the track and going towards 
the sounds in the bush we found a group of 12-14 hyenas chasing a herd 
of around eight elephants.

'The elephant herd included two adult females, a few teenagers, and a baby that was a few days old.

'The hyenas were trying to get at the baby - which had already been injured by the time we got there.

Protective: As the hyenas begin to surround the elephant, she becomes aggressive in an attempt to protect her young calf which has already been injured

Intimidating: The hyenas scattered as the elephant set about protecting its vulnerable calf

Attack: 'The hyenas were trying to get at the baby - which had already been injured by the time we got there,' said the photographer

'The elephants were running hard through the bush. The baby stuck close to the mother and the other elephants tried to stay around the baby as much as possible.

'They needed to stop to rest frequently - for the baby's sake. They formed a circle around the baby each time.

'The hyenas kept on darting in nipping at the baby during the chase - mauling the baby quite badly - especially its hindquarters.

'It was amazing to see some of the hyenas coming from all sides to irritate the larger elephants - and other hyenas to try and grab the baby whenever the attention of the larger elephants was diverted.

'The two adult elephants kept on swinging their trunks aggressively at the hyenas but did not injure them.

'We kept following the chase closely but keeping a safe distance away to avoid any human interference in this struggle of nature. During the chase, for almost an hour, the elephants managed to shake off the hyenas - but the hyenas found the elephants and the chase resumed. Eventually, the elephants escaped.

'It was probably one of the most exciting experiences - that pictures cannot do justice to. Going through the bush, we had some scratches and cuts.

'The noise of the animals, the rough ride through the bush, the dust - some purposely raised by the elephants to obscure their location - and the sheer thrill of this life-and-death encounter was unbelievable.'
