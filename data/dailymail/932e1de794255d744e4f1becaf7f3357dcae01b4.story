Tesco has apologised after one its stores continued to sell a line of burgers that should have been withdrawn in the wake of the horse meat scandal.

Customers were alarmed when the own-brand 'Free From' quarter pounder prompted an alert at the checkout, informing them that the 'product has been withdrawn from sale'.

But despite the warning, staff at the store in Cowley, Oxfordshire, ignored the system and allowed the customers to purchase the burgers anyway.

Apology: Tesco apologised after customers purchased a variety of burger that should have been withdrawn in the wake of the horse meat scandal at its store in Cowley, Oxfordshire

Tesco's error followed news that 
prestigious supermarket chain Waitrose has become the latest store to be
drawn into the scandal, as it admitted withdrawing thousands of 
burgers.

Tesco said it had launched an investigation into how the products remained on sale.

The error came to light, when the BBC was contacted by a concerned shopped, known only as David, who had purchased the burgers.

After being contacted the reporter was also able to buy the withdrawn product, when a member of staff overrode the block on the product's sale at the til.

David said: 'We said to the supervisor at the time we hoped the others will be taken off the shelves and the supervisor said they would make sure it gets done, which obviously it wasn't.

The supermarket giant said that the burger in question was not one of those found to contain horse DNA, but that the line had been withdrawn as a precautionary measure.

A Tesco spokesman said: 'The burger was not among those that had tested positive for horse DNA in a survey by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, but Tesco had withdrawn it as a precaution and it therefore should not have been on shelves and available for sale.

'The withdrawal was voluntary, and there is no evidence of any food safety problems with any of the burgers that have been removed from sale.

'We sincerely apologise for this, and we have spoken to the store to ensure that this does not happen again.'

Waitrose yesterday admitted pulling six product lines from its stores nationwide after its supplier Dalepak was temporarily stripped of its British Retail Association food standards accreditation.

Tests: Waitrose said all burgers had been tested and come back negative for horse DNA

The revelations are highly 
embarrassing for the store that previously distanced itself from the 
scandal and prides itself on the quality of its produce.

The upmarket supermarket insisted it is '100 per cent confident' that there was no horse meat in any of its burgers.

But the company admitted it had withdrawn its frozen burgers ‘as a precautionary measure’ after learning Dalepak had lost its accreditation.

Dalepak is one of three meat processing firms found to have horse DNA in its products and the debacle has affected a growing number of national and international firms.

Criticism: Mark Price, managing director of Waitrose, criticised supermarkets for selling cheap food, saying they had 'got the joke that cheap does not mean good value'

Waitrose managing director Mark Price had earlier lambasted supermarkets for selling cheap food, and said the horse meat scandal was inevitable due to major supermarkets squeezing their suppliers.

Only hours before his own supermarket admitted removing some of their own products, Mr Price said: 'Customers now have got the joke that cheap does not mean good value. Cheap just means cheap.'

He added: 'If you have a competition that says, ‘Who can sell the cheapest stuff?’ inevitably you will get something like this.

'What you've seen in UK food retail is packs get smaller. There's less mint in spearmint gum, the taste of chocolate biscuits is not what it was 10 years ago because, guess what, there's less chocolate in it.

'If people are managing to a price point, they will change the specification and they will cheat to get there. We’ve gone the other way.'

Although Waitrose's withdrawal came to light yesterday, the products were removed from stores on Monday.

An investigation by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland earlier this month found that Tesco had sold burgers contaminated with horse meat.

Asda, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op have since withdrawn its burgers as a precaution.

Fast food giant Burger King was yesterday accused of covering up its involvement in the horse meat scandal, after admitting it had secretly removed thousands of burgers from sale over the weekend as a precautionary measure, despite previously insisting no products had been withdrawn.

A Waitrose spokesman said all burgers had been tested and came back negative for horse DNA.

They said: ‘All our beef comes from our own British suppliers - we only use beef from British farms in all our fresh and frozen burgers and ready meals.

‘As a consequence we are 100 per cent confident in the integrity of our supply chain. The ingredients in our burgers are simple with all meat traceable back to British farms that we know.

‘Our frozen burgers - which make up eight per cent of our total burger sales - are produced by Dalepak.

‘Our technical team visited the Dalepak site last week and were happy that our products were produced to our high specification and separately from other companies’ products (ours are produced at 6am before other any other burgers).

The spokesman added: 'When the BRC [British Retail Consortium] suspended their accreditation of the site we decided - as a precautionary measure - to take our frozen burgers off sale. We understand the accreditation was reinstated on Thursday 24.1.13.

‘As a further precaution our frozen burgers (six lines) were sent for testing and we have just heard that they all tested negative for any species other than beef.’

Burger King was criticised for 
employing ‘shabby’ and ‘outrageous’ tactics in its attempts to escape 
being affected by the scandal.

Its
burgers, such as its best-selling Whopper, were made by the Irish meat 
processor Silvercrest, which is part of the ABP Food Group.

Silvercrest
also made burgers for Tesco which were then sold across Britain and 
Ireland contaminated with horse meat. Tesco has since apologised for 
unknowingly selling the contaminated products.

Last
week, when details of the illegal contamination of burgers emerged, 
Burger King insisted that its products were not involved and so would 
not be withdrawn.

However, it has now admitted that it removed thousands of burgers from sale over the weekend as a precautionary measure.

Other
retailers supplied by ABP, such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and the Co-op, 
were quick to react to the contamination news, removing ten million 
burgers from sale as a precautionary measure.

They took the decision while insisting there was no evidence that their burgers contained horse meat.

By
contrast, Burger King, which is estimated to sell 60million burgers in 
the UK every year, offered a series of guarantees and ‘absolute 
assurances’ to customers that it did not need to do the same.

Last
Wednesday, Anna Price, of Burger King’s public relations company Cohn 
& Wolfe, issued a statement saying: ‘Burger King Worldwide has been 
given absolute assurance by its supplier ABP/Silvercrest that no Burger 
King products are affected by the issue.’

Asked specifically by the Daily Mail whether it was withdrawing burgers, Miss Price issued a clear and categorical denial.

But
now the firm has admitted it has switched its burger supplier and 
warned customers that some products might be in short supply.

Burger
King said: ‘As a precaution, this past weekend we decided to replace 
all Silvercrest products in the UK & Ireland with products from 
another approved Burger King supplier. This is a voluntary and 
precautionary measure.’

Shocking: Tests carried out at Silvercrest in Ireland, who supllied Tesco, confirmed that frozen burgers were contaminated

The Department of Agriculture in Ireland revealed that it has taken more than 130 samples of burgers and ingredients in the past week from the Silvercrest facility.

Twenty four preliminary results were received late last night from a laboratory in Germany and these have been sent to an Irish lab for confirmation, but results have not been verified.

Irish Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney described the investigation as complex.

He said: 'I am not prepared to draw any conclusion until I'm fully satisfied that such conclusions are supported by facts. In any food incident the emphasis is always on dealing with the matter thoroughly, promptly and as transparently as possible to ensure that consumer confidence in the integrity of Irish food production is maintained.'

Mr Coveney repeated that results to date indicate no presence of equine DNA in raw materials sourced in Ireland.

Vet staff from the department have been in the plant trying to identify lists of ingredients used in the batches tested.
