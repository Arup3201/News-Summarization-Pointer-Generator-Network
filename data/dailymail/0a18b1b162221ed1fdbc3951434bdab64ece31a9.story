The number of internet trolls convicted in court of bullying online has soared by more than 150 per cent in just four years.

New figures show more than 1,200 people last year were convicted of sending offensive, obscene or threatening electronic messages - up from just 498 in 2007.

After several high profile cases involving celebrities and families grieving for loved ones being targeted on Twitter, Facebook and chatrooms, police have become more willing to use the full force of the law.

The number of convictions for sending offensive, indecent or menacing electronic messages in England and Wales has soared from 498 in 2007 to 1,286 in 2011

But prosecutors have also warned the criminal justice system could become overwhelmed with cases.

In August, classical singer Katherine
 Jenkins called in police after Twitter users threatened to ‘cut’ her 
over false rumours she had an affair with David Beckham.

Director
 of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer has promised that prosecutors will 
be given new guidance on dealing with social media cases, after a surge 
in complaints.

In
 September he ruled out taking legal action against Daniel Thomas, a 
semi-professional footballer who posted a homophobic tweet about Olympic
 diving star Tom Daley

‘The time has come for an informed debate about the boundaries of free speech in an age of social media,’ Mr Starmer said.

This month Mr Starmer was reported as
 suggesting new guidelines could mean only popular Twitter users are 
prosecuted for offensive comment in future.

Chief Constable Andy Trotter, ACPO lead on e-crime, said:  'The increase in reports of indecent, threatening or offensive messages sent on social media places an extra demand on police and that is only likely to increase. 

'ACPO looks forward to the Crown Prosecution Service’s guidance to police and prosecutors on this issue and will participate in the  consultation process. Many offensive comments are made every day on social media and guidance will assist the police to focus on the most serious matters.'

Classical singer Katherine Jenkins faced death threats on Twitter this summer while prosecutors decided not to take action against a footballer who posted an abusive message about Olympic swimmer Tom Daley

A breakdown of data for England and 
Wales reveals the South East to be the trolling capital of the nation, 
with 816 people found guilty from 2007-11.

Crime prevention minister Jeremy Browne told MailOnline: 'What is illegal offline is illegal online. People should not be able to use social media to post anonymous abusive or threatening comments without facing any consequences.

'We have robust legislation in place to deal with internet trolls, cyber-stalking and harassment but we recognise that having these laws is not enough on its own. That is why we are working with the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to improve guidance and training for police and prosecutors.

'Prevention is also key and the government is working with industry, academia, charities and parenting groups to develop tools to combat misuse of social networking sites.'

Under
 Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 it is an offence to ‘send by
 means of a public electronic communications network a message or other 
matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing 
character’.

Trolls
 can also be charged if, for the purpose of causing annoyance, 
inconvenience or needless anxiety to another, they send an electronic 
message which they know is false.

In 2010, Colm Coss, from Manchester, 
was jailed for 18 weeks under Section 127 after posting obscene messages
 on Facebook tribute sites, including one for former Big Brother star 
Jade Goody.

Offenders convicted under Section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to £5,000

Last month Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for 18 weeks after posting explicit comments and jokes about April and Madeleine McCann.

Also in October Azhar Ahmed, 20, of Fir Avenue, Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was ordered to carry out 240 hours community service and pay a fine of £300 after posting an offensive message on Facebook about the deaths of six British soldiers. He wrote: ‘All soldiers should die and go to hell.’

Official figures suggest around three
 quarters of cases result in a conviction. Offenders can be jailed for 
up to six months and fined up to £5,000.

In
 2007, 498 people were successfully convicted under Section 127, 
including 96 in the South East. It has risen sharply each year to top 
1,286 in 2011, including 227 in the South East.

Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer has said new guidelines are needed to help prosecutors to deal with a surge in complaints about messages posted online

In total, there have been 4,536 successful prosecutions from 2007-11.

Labour MP Andrew Gwynne, who obtained the figures in parliamentary questions, said:  MP said:‘Given
 the massive growth in the internet and other media like Twitter and 
Facebook, it is hardly surprising that there has been such an increase 
in harassment convictions over the electronic media.

'It is important that there are guidelines governing the internet to ensure it isn’t used to harass people.’

In a debate on the subject last 
month, media minister Ed Vaizey said: ‘This Government are committed to 
tackling trolling, cyber-bullying and other forms of abuse and misuse of
 social networking sites.’

He rejected calls for new laws, insisting Section 127 had been proven to be effective.

‘It
 has been established that abuse posted on social media sites, such as 
Facebook and Twitter, can be prosecuted under that Act and, as case law 
develops in that area, we will see swift action when such cases arise,’ 
he added.

Section
 127 was used to prosecute Paul Chambers over a tweet he sent after 
being delayed at Doncaster Airport. He wrote: ‘Crap! Robin Hood Airport 
is closed. You’ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together 
otherwise I am blowing the airport sky high!!’ The conviction was eventually quashed by an appeal court.

Jeremy
 Todd, chief executive of BullyingUK, said:  ‘Trolling is 
straightforwardly bullying: intimidation and harassment perpetrated by a
 person who feels anonymous because they don't have to use their real 
Identity. 

‘People across the UK – young and old alike - really need to think carefully before they get involved in what might be seemingly harmless and imagine how it will be taken by the person, or their family, on the receiving end. 

‘Actions on the Internet can have real consequences and the law is clear that using a communication system to harass or intimidate another person is an offence.  

'The law protects those on the receiving end of trolling behaviour, as recent cases have shown: trolls are not beyond the long arm of the law.’
