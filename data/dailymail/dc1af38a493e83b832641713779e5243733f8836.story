'Tyrelle got on the phone and said "mum I can't do this anymore",' Johanna said.

'I got there and the ambulance crew were working on her, but I could see she was already gone.

'She had a big heart. Sometimes I would even say to her she has a halfway house because anyone that wanted to stay, she'd let them stay.'

Victorian homicide squad detectives are searching for a man and woman in their 20s who left the home shortly after the incident. 

'We believe we know those people and we're asking them to contact the police and come forward,' Detective Inspector Mick Hughes said on Monday.

Police would not give a description or detail their involvement in the investigation, but said the group was known to each other. 

'They were all in the house just prior to the assault,' Det Insp Hughes said. 

'They went into the bedroom and there was a discussion in the bedroom that escalated.'

Police do not know what the argument was about.

Two other men who were at the house at the time were questioned by police, but have been cleared as suspects.

Ms Evertsen-Mostert's partner, Jason, was also injured in the attack and was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
