Although 90 per cent of Brits consider themselves to be courteous travellers, 75 per cent of people are fed up with dealing with ‘luggage louts'.

Defined as someone with no spatial awareness, a luggage lout 'displays selfish, aggressive and clumsy behaviour when in charge of bags, suitcases or backpacks' according to a new survey.

The research also reveals that 40 per cent of travellers have suffered a 'baggage related injury' in the last 12 months, and that mobile phone distraction is cited as the main cause of luggage rage.

In a hurry? One in 10 travellers say they couldn¿t care less about their manners when in a rush

The 
research, carried out by Rolling Luggage reveals that one in 10 
travellers say they couldn’t care less about their manners when in a 
rush, and that families with young children are the biggest ‘luggage 
louts’.

Luggage rage is particularly bad when 
people are in a hurry, says the research, with more than 10 per cent of Brits admitting they couldn’t
 care less about their manners when in a rush and are more concerned 
about getting to their destination on time.

The
 research also showed that families with young children are seen as the 
biggest culprits of luggage loutishness with two thirds of respondents 
claiming that families are less than attentive to the needs of other 
travellers.

Who shall we ram next, Daddy?

Families were 
closely followed by groups of stag and hen parties with 25 per cent of 
respondents frustrated by their ‘safety in numbers’ luggage loutism.

While
 Spain, France and the USA are cited as the top three destinations for 
passengers being loutish with luggage, the worst luggage lout hotspots 
to avoid in the UK are London (81 per cent), Birmingham (79 per cent) 
and Manchester (73 per cent).

Airports
 are the most stress inducing locations (40 percent), followed by trains
 (36 per cent), train stations (26 per cent) and airport baggage claim 
(24 per cent)

As
 for what age group is the worst offender, 18-34 year olds admit to 
being the worst luggage louts while the best behaved are the over 55’s.

Meanwhile
 four in ten (40 per cent) Brits admit they have suffered a 
luggage-related injury, with back pain (65 per cent), sore hands (52 per
 cent), neck pain (37 per cent) and bruises (23 per cent) named as the 
most common ailments.

Other findings from the survey, which 
questioned 2,000 holidaymakers, showed that the Scots have the least 
sympathy for late travellers.

1.  Stopping with baggage in a crowded area without any warning 2.  Stopping to take an ‘airport selfie’ on a mobile phone while carrying luggage 3.  Running over someone’s feet with a wheeled bag 4.  Banging into someone with a backpack or not removing it when on a crowded train5.  Pushing in front of others to get to the airport carousel first

One in five Scots admitted they would refuse to
 let a late-running passenger past to catch their flight or train. 

But
 bad manners doesn’t just affect the UK. The research shows the 
international hotspots for passengers being inconsiderate whilst in 
charge of luggage are Spain, France and the USA in the top three spots, 
closely followed by Germany and Greece. 

'Travelling with heavy 
bags and suitcases through busy airports and train stations can be 
stressful and demanding,' said Waseem Malik Khawar of Rolling Luggage.

'But even if you are in a rush it is important to be ‘luggage aware’ to 
manage both your own stress levels and those of your fellow travellers.'
