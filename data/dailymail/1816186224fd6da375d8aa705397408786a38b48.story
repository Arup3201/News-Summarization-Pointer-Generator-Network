It beat 'twerking' to be crowned word
 of the year by editors of the Oxford English Dictionary and it seems 
that the power of the selfie shows no sign of abating thanks to image 
conscious Brits.

A new study reveals that Brits are so selfie obsessed that the average woman spends an entire month of her life capturing her own face.

But it isn't a case of 'I woke up like this', with the study revealing that women spend a total of 753 hours taking, deleting, retaking and touching up their social media selfies to look picture perfect.

That's a lot of selfies! A new survey reveals that image-conscious British women spend an entire month of their lives taking selfies just like selfie fan, Miranda Kerr

So how do we do it? The study revealed the top five tricks women use to make sure they look their best in their selfies are: using soft mood lighting (51 per cent); shooting from a downward angle (47 per cent); adopting a slimming body pose (46 per cent); using smartphone filters (37 per cent) and ‘smizing’ - a term coined by Tyra Banks that means smiling with our eyes (29 per cent).

The ladies of Cardiff favour using filters, 20 per cent of Southampton women love the pouty ‘duck face’, often adopted by Kim Kardashian, and 63 per cent of Newcastle women use flattering lighting in their snaps.

A quarter of women confessed that they would never upload a photo of themselves online without resorting to at least one of these quick-fix tricks first.

The selfie capital of the UK was revealed as Belfast, where over 84 per cent of respondents take at least one per week.

This was closely followed by Birmingham (81 per cent) and Newcastle (76 per cent). In contrast, women from Cornwall are least likely to post selfies, with only 54 per cent doing so each week.

With the rise of online dating apps, such as Tinder and LinkedUp, it seems that the pressure for women to aspire to perfection on social media platforms has never been higher. 

Almost two thirds (61 per cent) of the women questioned said that they felt the increasing popularity of dating sites and apps has also intensified the pressure to look good online.

In fact, single men, take heed: 71 per cent of women admit they would be seriously put off if a prospective beau looked nothing like their dating profile picture on a first date.

A spokesperson for The Body Shop said: 'It’s clear that the rise in popularity of selfies has really ramped up the pressure for us to make that all-important first impression online.

'However, The Body Shop has always been committed to activating self-esteem and we are passionate about giving women the tools to feel more confident in their skin.'
