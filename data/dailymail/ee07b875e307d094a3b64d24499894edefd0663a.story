Jonny Evans was left on crutches after another bruising afternoon for Manchester United and now has a fight to be fit for next weekend.

The central defender was forced off during a demoralising defeat away at Leicester City with a leg injury.

It leaves Louis van Gaal with a selection headache at the back ahead of West Ham’s trip to Old Trafford on Saturday.

The United manager has come under fire from Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher for failing to address defensive problems in the summer. Even though they have landed Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo, the argument is that the Reds lack a commanding centre-half.

That will come sharply into focus against the Hammers if Evans isn’t deemed fit enough to play.

Van Gaal said: ‘He got a kick. I don't know how bad it is. We have to wait and see. He's on crutches,’ but isn’t unduly worried.

‘I think Shaw shall be fit enough to play and Rojo and Smalling can play. We can manage.’
