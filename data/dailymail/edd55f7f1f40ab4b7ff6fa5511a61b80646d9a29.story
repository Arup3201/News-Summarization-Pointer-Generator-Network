Police have launched an investigation into the senior NHS children’s brain doctor exposed last week by The Mail on Sunday for taking a cocktail of illegal drugs just before going on duty.

An hour after Dr Colin Ferrie was filmed snorting cocaine with an acquaintance and taking the powerful sedative and date-rape drug GHB, the hospital where he works confirmed he was on call for his vulnerable young patients.

Last night West Yorkshire Police said that the same officers who investigated shamed Co-op Bank boss the Reverend Paul Flowers –who has since been prosecuted for his drug use – would be handling the inquiry.

Dangerous habit: The damning text messages between Dr Ferrie and a friend, which date from May last year

A spokesman said: ‘West Yorkshire Police is now conducting an investigation into potential drugs offences following an article in a national Sunday newspaper about a member of staff at Leeds General Infirmary.’

The Mail on Sunday has agreed to hand over its dossier of evidence to police.

The move comes as fresh testimony emerged that Dr Ferrie, a consultant paediatric neurologist and a leading expert on childhood epilepsy based at Leeds General, has been a regular user of powerful illegal drugs, including dangerous and addictive Class As, for some time.

Following our shocking exposé last weekend, this paper was contacted by another drug-taking friend of the consultant about a night of debauchery last May during which Dr Ferrie consumed five different mind-altering substances.

As well as two powerful Class A stimulants – cocaine and crystal meth – he also took party and date-rape drug GHB, the Class B stimulant mephedrone (similar to ecstasy and often referred to as Mcat), and sniffed amyl nitrite or ‘poppers’.

‘I was surprised by just how keen he was on taking chemicals but I knew he was a doctor so I guessed he must know what he was doing,’ said the man. ‘Now I think he needs help.

Inquiry: Dr Colin Ferrie has been suspended from his role at Leeds General Infirmary

‘That night he took cocaine, GHB, Mcat, crystal meth and poppers and then drove home, saying he had work the next day.’

In text messages exchanged before the meeting on May 4, the doctor left nothing to chance in his quest to secure narcotics.

Concerned that his companion might not be able to afford the cocktail of drugs, Dr Ferrie sent him a text message asking: ‘Do u want me to transfer some cash for the chems?’

The man replied that he could get the mephedrone and try to find GHB – referred to as ‘g’ in the message – saying the drugs would cost £30 in total. Almost immediately, the doctor replied: ‘I reckon we will need more. I’ll transfer 60.’

Minutes later, the consultant sent another text: ‘Will we be able to get more later if we need it?’ before sending a further message: ‘Pity you cannot get Tina.’ Tina is a street name for powerfully addictive crystal meth, the most potent and long-lasting form of methamphetamine, and which was made famous in the hit TV series Breaking Bad.

Last week we revealed that Dr Ferrie had spoken of his love for the drug, the effects of which can last for several days.

The man said that when the doctor arrived for their meeting in Manchester at around 9.30pm on May 4, he brought crystal meth with him as well as three grams of cocaine and ‘poppers’. ‘After he had transferred me £60, I had bought two bags of Mcat for us, as well as 40ml of GHB, so I was surprised by how much more he brought with him.

‘He had a little bag with him containing the coke – there was enough for about 15 lines, some crystal meth which he took through a tube, and poppers which give you a headrush. There were three of us there and we pretty much did all the drugs, going on until about 5.30am.

‘Then Colin drove home. I asked if he’d be all right driving and he said he was used to it. He told me he had work the next day, but I don’t know if he was referring to the Monday or the Tuesday.’

Last week, Dr Ferrie was unavailable for comment, but when The Mail on Sunday contacted him on Friday he said: ‘I have no comment to make.’ Asked whether he had taken a cocktail of drugs on May 4 last year, he refused to comment. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust refused to say whether the consultant was on duty over that May Bank Holiday weekend.

A spokeswoman said: ‘As there is now a police investigation into this matter, we are not able to comment on whether Dr Ferrie was on duty on any given date.’

On call: An hour after Dr Colin Ferrie was filmed snorting cocaine and taking the powerful sedative and date-rape drug GHB, Leeds General Infirmary, above, confirmed he was on call for his vulnerable young patients

The hospital admitted that worried parents of his vulnerable patients had been ringing in to ask about the scandal. ‘We have a Patient Advice and Liaison Service which has been taking calls from concerned parents and have talked them through what is going on with the help of a consultant neurologist,’ said the spokeswoman. She added: ‘Dr Ferrie has been excluded from duties at the Trust pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations against him. The Trust has been in contact with West Yorkshire Police about this matter and is fully co-operating with them.

‘Arrangements are being made to ensure scheduled clinics and appointments can go ahead with alternative staff providing cover.’

The maximum penalty for the possession of Class A drugs is seven years in prison, while for Class B drugs it is five years.

GHB is Class C drug, and supplying someone else, even friends, can result in up to 14 years in jail.

Family of epilepsy boy sue over care

By Stephanie Condron for the Mail On Sunday

Colin Ferrie is being sued for negligence by the family of a 14-year-old epilepsy patient, it emerged last night.

News of the legal action comes after the consultant was suspended from clinical work at Leeds General Infirmary following our revelations last week.

The teenager’s family, who have asked not to be identified, complain that instead of referring the boy for surgery at the earliest possible stage in his illness, Dr Ferrie put him on a succession of about 15 strong drugs that has left him with the mental age of a toddler.

The boy’s mother lost faith with Dr Ferrie and instead took her son to Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, where she was told he was a prime candidate for surgery that would help stop up to 150 seizures a day.

The youngster finally had the operation in August 2013.

The child’s mother said she was ‘deeply disturbed’ to learn that Dr Ferrie had been filmed snorting cocaine and taking GHB.

‘Shocked does not even cover it,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I am still physically shaking now from reading it. It’s horrendous.’

Her son has a rare form of epilepsy called Doose syndrome, which causes him to fall to the floor without warning. He was having about 150 fits a day when Dr Ferrie first began treating him.

She says her son ‘should have had this surgery when he was five or six years old after the third or fourth medication did not work’.

The family originally asked for a second opinion in 2007, presenting the request in writing to Dr Ferrie during an appointment.

‘He screwed it up and put it in the bin,’ she said.

‘Years later, we were still not happy – my son was getting worse and worse.’

She launched a clinical negligence claim in November 2013. Her lawyers are now compiling a dossier on the family’s complaints.

Last night, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust confirmed Dr Ferrie had been treating the boy and issued a brief statement which read: ‘We can confirm we have been approached by the family’s legal representatives for information about care provided by the Trust.’

Dr Ferrie said he did not want to comment, referring The Mail on Sunday to the Medical Defence Union, a body that advises doctors on negligence claims.

An MDU spokesman said: ‘He cannot give his side of the story because he has a duty of patient confidentiality.’
