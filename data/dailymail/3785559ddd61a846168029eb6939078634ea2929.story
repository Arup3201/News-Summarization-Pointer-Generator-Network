James Anderson felt this winter’s Ashes pain more keenly than his England team-mates — because he played the majority of the 5-0 whitewash with a broken rib.

Although the injury was kept quiet, it has prevented him bowling a ball in the six weeks since returning from Australia.

The Lancashire fast bowler, second on England’s Test all-time wickettakers’ list behind Sir Ian Botham, was struck while attempting to pull a Peter Siddle short ball in the second Test at Adelaide.

‘It was suspected that it was broken straight away but it wasn’t confirmed until ahead of the fourth Test in Melbourne when it was decided to get an X-ray done,’ said an England source.

‘There’s nothing you can do to treat broken ribs anyway, so it was a case of just getting on with things.’

The medical staff got the damaged area scanned after Anderson reported increased discomfort ahead of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.

The 31-year-old played through the discomfort on a concoction of painkillers and adrenalin but failed to reach the heights of the 2010-11 series, when he finished as the most prolific bowler on either side, claiming 23 victims in England’s 3-1 win.

That tour also featured Anderson nursing a sore rib after Chris Tremlett inflicted a hairline crack while boxing at the German boot camp, although he had fully recovered by the first Test in Brisbane.

The injury revelation helps to explain why a man widely regarded as the most skilful new-ball operator in world cricket claimed a modest 14 wickets at 43.94 runs apiece.

While Anderson decided to play on through the pain barrier, other members of the shamed England squad did not see out the tour.

When England were looking for someone to step forward during the final test in Sydney, Boyd Rankin twice left the pitch suffering from back spasms and cramp and sent down only 20 overs in the humiliating 281-run loss.

Although Anderson has been reporting for pre-season county duty at Old Trafford, his participation has been restricted to working on a batting technique remodelled by former international colleague Kevin Pietersen over the winter.

However, it is anticipated he will begin bowling in the indoor nets within a fortnight and will be fit for newly promoted Lancashire’s opening County Championship fixture against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on April 6.

Meanwhile, England’s abject effort Down Under was put into a slightly kinder perspective yesterday as South Africa, the world’s No 1 Test playing nation, were also humbled by the rampant Australians.

Mitchell Johnson, the scourge of Anderson and the England team, followed up his 37-wicket Ashes haul by returning match figures of 12-127 as the Aussies crushed South Africa by 281 runs in the first Test at Centurion.

‘You never play a perfect game but it felt really good out there,’ said Johnson.

The South Africans were skittled for 200 on the fourth day as Australia made it six Test wins in a row.

Skipper Michael Clarke said: ‘We worked exceptionally hard and, wh e n I look i n my teammates’ eyes at the moment, they are so hungry to continue their success.’ South Africa will be determined to make amends in the second Test, which starts in Port Elizabeth on Thursday.

Captain Graeme Smith said: ‘We did not meet expectations and we deserve every bit of abuse that comes our way. It is one of the most disappointing four days we’ve had as a team.’
