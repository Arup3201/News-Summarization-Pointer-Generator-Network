 on current issues in football.

THE GLORIOUS GERMANS

I've been reading through the weeks that Germany are not an outstanding team – just a good team.

Many experts have talked them down and I cannot understand it.

For me, they are a completely different class – and they proved it on Sunday night by winning the World Cup in extra time against Argentina.

They don't have any wing wizards, magical No 10s, or match-winners like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.

In Spain this season, Atletico Madrid won the league without the so-called Galacticos and pin-up poster boys, but with a high work ethic, unity, discipline and a willingness to stand man-to-man with the opposition to compete.

They excelled with a fierce desire and they played with pace and passion.

I guess the experts would say they are a good team, because they don't have the fancy Dans who flick it and tip-tap it around the half-way line.

Germany remind me of Atletico Madrid. They are well-drilled, competitive and have pace throughout the team.

I love the way they play, I love their attitude. They have no Big Time Charlies.

They are like a Mercedes-Benz: oozing quality, good on the eye and they can run all day.

For me, they are outstanding.

RODGERS RECRUITING THE RIGHT WAY

At Tottenham last summer, technical director Franco Baldini was the key man in recruiting and spending the cash they got from Gareth Bale's world record transfer.

Most of those players were not Andre Villas-Boas's choice and for a manager, having players bought for you who you don't think are good enough is extremely difficult.

The powers that be will constantly question why they're not playing and if you lose, the clamp around you gets tighter and tighter.

The squeeze of pressure grows and the manager starts to feel the heat.

Some managers end up playing people they don't think are good enough to satisfy the people upstairs.

AVB last season had no chance. The players would've known that he was unhappy; that he was stressed and he was fielding players who were quite clearly not good enough.

That's what you can get with a director of football who goes off and buys only the players that he wants.

Back for more: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (centre) returned to the training pitch last week

Key role: Barry Hunter is Rodgers' chief scout at Liverpool

At Liverpool it is very different. Brendan Rodgers is in complete control.

His chief scout and main man for recruiting is Barry Hunter.

Barry was a player at Reading and he has an encyclopedic knowledge of players all over the world.

Brendan took him from Manchester City and he is a top Dog.

They have built up a fantastic network of scouts and Barry collects air miles like I collect Nectar points.

These players would've all been analysed, Moneyball-style, and no-one would've been brought in at Anfield without Brendan's approval. It is the only way it can work.

At one club I worked at, the chairman had signed five players, four of whom were nowhere near good enough. I nodded and agreed, then didn't play them. Within six weeks I'd got the bullet.

SUAREZ OVERSTEPS THE MARK

When I was a boy growing up I loved watching tennis at Wimbledon. In those days the two great players were Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe.

Borg always wore Fila gear with his Diadora trainers and McEnroe had on his Sergio Tacchini kit and Nike trainers. This was back when they played with brown wooden rackets.

Borg was relaxed, had very few expressions, silent assassin eyes and was calmness personified.

Controversy: Luis Suarez was banned from world football for four months after biting Giorgio Chiellini

McEnroe beat himself up if he lost any point. Smashing his racket on the ground, on his head or on anything nearby.

Any decision that went the wrong way, the line judge or the umpire got it with both barrels.

His eyes were viscous and he was Mr Angry. He never had a good word to say about anybody and I loved him.

He was a character, he was different and he was Mad.

You cannot be serious: Tennis player John McEnroe was renowned for his tantrums on the court

Luis Suarez fits into that McEnroe bracket.

He can display extreme brilliance and magic on the football pitch, but then his mind goes and he does something no-one can believe.

I personally feel he overstepped the mark once too often, however brilliant he is, and believe Liverpool have made the right decision to move him on.

MY WEEK...

I spent my Saturday afternoon basking in the sunshine sat next to the legend Barry Fry as Peterborough United visited Barnet for a pre-season friendly.

His energy, enthusiasm and knowledge of the game was quite amazing. He knew every single one of my players; where they came from, their ages, he knew the lot.

Then the guy sat in front also started commenting and telling me the ages of our players and where they had been before.

I thought, 'Who the hell is this Irish man?' Until he turned around with his skinhead, windscreen-sized sunglasses, smiled at me and introduced himself as Darragh MacAnthony, the chairman of Peterborough.

Between them they have unearthed many good young players from the lower divisions.

Look out for the wizard Erhun Oztumer next season.

He is a 5ft 3ins attacking midfield player they have just signed from Dulwich Hamlet.

We lost the friendly 1-0 and he ran the show.

Oh my God – he is magic and he is well worth the admission money alone for any football supporter.

He only comes up to my knees, but he is quick. You wait until you see him.
