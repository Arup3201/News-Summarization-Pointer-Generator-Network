Serenaded by a jazz band, a chapter of Hell’s Angels, his family and more old geezers than on the Old Kent Road, Ronnie Biggs made his last escape yesterday afternoon — to the hereafter.

His wicker coffin draped in the flags of Britain and his adopted Brazil, the best-known — if least important — of the Great Train Robbers was almost a figure of suburban respectability as he took his final bow in the same North London crematorium as Sigmund Freud, George Bernard Shaw and the Maharaja of Cooch-Behar.

But here, too, were all the trappings of a traditional gangland funeral — minus the horse-drawn hearse and gold knuckledusters.

Guests had been respectfully asked not to dress in black or wear ‘aggressive or offensive jewellery’. How thoughtful.

The rules did not seem to apply to floral tributes, though. One mourner had sent one in the shape of Biggs’s trademark V-sign.

Shakespeare
and the poems of Biggs the bard himself were liberally quoted in a 
service that drew large numbers of shaven-headed men in leather coats 
and a few hard-smoking women.

How
many actually knew the man? One of the Hell’s Angels cheerfully 
admitted he was just a ‘hanger on’, but said he was glad to be part of 
it all. There was also a smattering of celebrities from showbusiness and
the criminocracy.

Actor 
Steven Berkoff arrived late — ‘the traffic was murder’ he told a 
congregation not unfamiliar with the real thing — to deliver his 
reflections on ‘a modern-day Ulysses’.

Drug
smuggler-turned-author Howard Marks saluted ‘a man of great nobility’ 
while admitting he had never actually met Biggs in person.

Celebrity
ex-gangster Dave Courtney arrived bearing a floral display in the shape
of a train and the succinct inscription ‘Gutted’.

Armed
robber and certified madman Charles Bronson also sent a bouquet from 
prison and a separate message that was read out during the service: 
‘Ronnie was an icon, a man’s man. Max respect to a diamond geezer.’

There
was a lot of this sort of stuff all afternoon and on into the night as 
the mourners grew increasingly lachrymose at a boozer on the Finchley 
Road.

Also represented was 
another strand of London criminal folklore in the form of Freddie ‘Brown
Bread’ Foreman, erstwhile henchman of the Kray twins.

But
for all the clapped-out tough guy posturing and half-hearted clenched 
fist salutes, the most genuine moment of the day was when Biggs’s son, 
Michael, delivered a moving eulogy to the father who had, for many 
years, raised him as a single parent in Rio.

Acknowledging
that Biggs the villain had been a ‘petty crook who never had any real 
success’, he spoke emotionally of the jazz-loving, samba-dancing, 
Arsenal-mad champion of the underdog who became ‘my dad, my mum, my 
entire family’.

Michael was 
the product of Biggs’s affair with a Brazilian dancer after he had fled 
to Rio from Australia when his cover was blown in 1970.

His
first wife, the devoted Charmian, remained in Australia with their two 
surviving sons (another boy, Nicky, died in a car accident).

She
still lives there, still bears his name and had sent her own recording 
of Shakespeare’s sonnet — ‘Let me not to the marriage of true minds.

Admit
impediments ...’  This was more than goodbye to a famous ex-con. This 
was a farewell to that black-and-white world of old-style cops and 
robbers, of ‘Slipper of the Yard’ and ‘Buster’ Edwards, of bygone heists
planned in smoke-filled pubs and exhaustively chronicled by Fleet 
Street for the benefit of a more innocent world.

The
Great Train Robbery remains the last criminal showstopper of modern 
times which did not involve guns, knives, death, sex or drugs. The 
30-year sentence Biggs received would be inconceivable now.

For
all the sentimental tosh  spoken about it yesterday, however, it was no
Ealing comedy. Train driver Jack Mills received a savage beating and 
many of those involved were never the same again.

Biggs
was not a key member of the  gang that seized more than £2.6 million 
from the Glasgow-to- London mail train in August 1963.

His job had merely been to supply a bent train driver to replace Mills (in the end, Biggs’s man was not even up to the task).

Biggs himself once likened his role to that of ‘teaboy’.

His
notoriety and enduring  celebrity followed his escape from Wandsworth 
Prison to Australia and, latterly, Brazil, where he spent 31 years 
raising his proverbial two fingers to British justice.

Even after returning home in 2001, upon which he was immediately imprisoned, his attitude was much the same.

Short
of cash and laid low by three strokes, he threw himself at the mercy of
the NHS and the British taxpayer, pleading: ‘I am a sick man. My last 
wish is to walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of 
bitter.’

Notorious: Ronnie Biggs, who died last month, revelled in the fame his heinous crime brought him

In 2009, Britain was taken for another ride when Biggs was released from prison in the belief that he was about to die.

Two
years later, he was still well enough to say that he was ‘proud’ to 
have been one of the robbers, adding: ‘I would do it all again without 
the slightest hesitation!’

Nine
months ago, hunched in a wheelchair at the funeral of gang leader Bruce
Reynolds, Biggs raised another two-fingered salute at the media.

Yet
it was the media whom Biggs had to thank for the one thing that kept 
the money rolling in long after his stolen loot ran out: the legend of 
Ronnie Biggs.

Yesterday, that legend came to an end, far from the dancing girls of the Copacabana, in Golders Green crematorium.

As his son admitted fondly, the old rogue had not even left enough money to cover last night’s bar bill.
