North Korea's national airline is the world's only carrier to be awarded just one star - for the fourth time in a row.

Air Koryo came last in a list of the world's 600 carriers, ranked on in-flight meals, the skill of staff, aircraft age and efficiency.

The dismal performance comes despite North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attempting to revitalise the country's national airline and even rumours claiming the dictator wants cabin crew to wear skimpier uniforms.

The terrible rating of North Korean's national airline Air Koryo will likely mean Kim Jong-un pushes ahead with aviation improvements

Air Koryo has been ranked as the worst airline in the world for 2014 in Skytrax's recent research, for the fourth consecutive year

The research carried out by Skytrax, a UK-based consultancy providing airline and airport reviews and rankings, gave the airline low ranking for its aging aircraft and outdated practices.

With no new aircraft purchased for over 20 years, a fleet of 64 obsolete planes that date back to the 1960s, it seems the urgings of the Supreme Leader have fallen on deaf ears.

The fleet flies to 14 airports in six countries; the most popular destinations are Beijing and Shenyang in China.

As expected, in-flight entertainment is restricted to magazines and films detailing the great works of North Korea's leader Jong Un. Due to the age of the aircraft, the cockpit is behind the times with no digital assistance

Luggage is still weighed by hand on old fashioned scales in the deserted airport customs lounge. The cabins look like something out of a museum, and the in-flight meals are constantly criticised by flyers.  

The findings were based on the skill-set of staff, standard of in-flight meals and entertainment, and quality of aircraft

The aircraft for Air Koryo can be dated back to the 1960s and are in urgent need of modernisiation if the fleet is to rise from one-star level

Perhaps what will irk Kim Jong Un even more is that six of the seven five-star airlines are all based out of the Far East.

Japan's ANA All Nippon Airways, South Korea's Asiana Airlines, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways, Indonesia's Garuda Indonesia, China's Hainan Airlines and Singapore Airlines are all top of the tree, along with Qatar Airways. 

Photographer Aram Pan from Singapore gained unprecedented access to the Soviet-era planes still used in North Korea by the nation’s civil carrier, Air Koryo, plus cargo transporters and helicopters, after joining a tour for aviation enthusiasts inside the communist enclave.

From the photos, the airline, which was founded in 1950 as a joint North Korean-Soviet partnership to connect the capital Pyongyang with Moscow, appears to be stuck in a time warp.  

Photographer Aram Pan was greeted by smiling Air Koryo flight attendants dressed in smart navy blue outfits before he boarded an Ilyushin Il-18 plane, a large turboprop airliner. The Soviet aircraft was first flown in 1957

Inside the cockpit of the Ilyushin Il-18 things looks very different to modern planes, there is not a digital screen in sight

The cockpit in the Ilyushin Il-18 plane, a large turboprop airliner that first flew in 1957, is a long way from digital. Astonishingly, the flight’s communication officer appears to sit in the passenger seating area and listens in to air traffic control on an ancient pair of headphones.

While the Ilyushin Il-18 is known for its durability, with many planes achieving over 45,000 flight hours, there is a bold contrast in its appearance to modern aircrafts. 

In March 2006, due to safety and maintenance concerns, Air Koryo was banned from flying into the European Union. In March 2010, the airline was allowed to resume operations  but only with their TU-204s aircraft.

‘At first I was a little nervous about flying,’ Mr Pan, who was on his third trip to North Korea, told Daily Mail Australia.

However, he said after his first flight in a historic plane ‘it wasn’t scary at all’. 

Six of the top five-star airlines are in the Far East, which will more than likely anger Kim Jong-un even more

An Air Koryo flight to Pyongyang Sunan International Airport, the main airport serving North Korea, shows its ready for boarding. Mr Pan flew from Kuala Lumpur into Pyongyang with Air Koryo on the August 25 

The new modernised Pyongyang International Airport is nearing completion and looks set to open in this year

'I was constantly looking forward to the next joyride. Besides… there were 48 other members of the tour group and everyone was like a kid in the candy store. I couldn’t possibly be nervous with everyone so psyched up about every ride,’ he added. 

Mr Pan flew out to North Korea with UK based company Juche Travel, who have been running DPRK aviation tours for the past three years.

‘The DPRK is now the only country in the world where you can reliably fly on all major Soviet era aircraft in one place,’ their website informs.

From the 11-20 September, the flyers experienced eight different aircraft types on both scheduled international and internal charter flights. 

Inside the Ilyushin Il-18 there are blue chairs and blue carpet. Curtains draw across the windows and overhead luggage is stored less securely than in modern planes 

Not enough leg room? Seats on the Ilyushin Il-18 all fold down. But entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their DPRK dramas and documentaries, Mr Pan revealed

The in-flight meal featured rice and chicken and fruit cocktail for desert. 'The food is better than I expected,' Mr Pan commented 

In Mr Pan’s revealing photos, he shows the empty airport customs area at Pyongyang, the main airport serving North Korea, as well as a glimpse at the revamped International Airport which looks set to open in 2015.

A new airport isn’t the only update North Korea is making to its airline. In 2013, Air Koryo appeared to be making efforts to update its image to the outside world, changing the uniforms worn by flight attendants from red and white to navy blue with a white studded trim.

Flight attendants smile in the smart outfits in Mr Pan’s photos, their black hair swept back into chic buns.

'The air stewardess are polite and soft spoken. From what I understand, they never leave the plane to change shifts at Kuala Lumpur,’ Mr Pan said after his international flight. 

Inside the plane, entertainment is limited to only one channel playing their DPRK dramas and documentaries but the seats do fold down for extra leg room. 

In the services area of the Ilyushin Il-18, a steward prepared the meals metal containers. Unlabelled bottled water was stored in a tub 

The female flight attendants served drinks from plastic cups. In 2013 some of the attendants' uniforms changed from red and white to navy blue with studded white trim

Life vests are stored under the seats of the Ilyushin Il-18 in case of emergencies. The toilet area features an old fifties interior 

Mr Pan has previously visited North Korea twice, and in 2013 he witnessed bustling markets, men and women enjoying themselves at a Western looking water park and miles and miles of crops ready for harvest, shattering all of his illusions about what a holiday to North Korea would entail.

This time he said his trip was 'a very different experience' because he wasn't on his own with just official guides to keep him company.

‘I ended up being the odd one out… it was like I attended a Star Trek convention and everybody was speaking Klingon. These guys absolutely love and know their planes,’ Mr Pan said of joining the aviation fans.

‘The tour group were all over the runway, happily snapping away at the planes. And the North Korean government didn’t even mind one bit,’ he said.

In one of Mr Pan’s videos the tour group is seen running across the runway in a dash to get the best seats on the plane.

And despite North Korea being known as highly-secretive, the photographer believes his latest tour shows things are becoming more open.

‘It's a huge leap forward in terms of relaxing the rules. Everyone was even allowed into the cockpits to take photos,’ he said.

The communications officer on the flight sat outside the cockpit in the passenger area and listened in with an ancient looking pair of headphones

The old green seats in the Ilyushin Il-18 cockpit are covered with beige material. The empty weight of the plane is 35,000 kg 

Mr Pan also took a flight on the Russian made Tupolev Tu-204. 'I'm told this particular plane is only four years old,' he said

The safety instructions on board the flights were in both Korean and English

Mr Pan said: 'The air stewardess are polite and soft spoken. From what I understand, they never leave the plane to change shifts at Kuala Lumpur'

Toilets in the Tupolev Tu-204 were 'clean' and had 'no foul smell'. Mr Pan flew into Pyongyang again with Air China on September 13

Mr Pan boarded a night flight at Pyongyang Airport with 49 other passengers from 13 different countries

He took a flight on Air Koryo's Mi-17, a Soviet-designed medium twin-turbine transport helicopter

While flying Mr Pan believes he spotted a Korean Air plane sharing the same skies. 'Look what I saw outside the window of Koryo Air,' he said
