A very personal Christmas card featuring the Bazley-Jackson living room took on a more comic turn than the family intended after their dog Monty contributed his own set of baubles to the image.

The card featured all three of the pets belonging to the family from Shepton Mallet, Somerset.

But while Toto was cuddled up in his Christmassy dog jacket and cat Mr Pickles appeared the picture of elegance on a chair, it was impossible for receivers not to have their attention drawn towards Monty.

The dog's... er... decorations: The three animals of the Bazley-Jackson family enjoy the fire... perhaps too much in the case of Monty (centre)

The unfortunate chocolate Labrador had his private parts splayed all over neighbours' mantlepieces - and it has since become a online hit.

The card is the latest of a number of controversial Christmas cards that have graced the post this year.

Last week, residents of the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham were treated to a card from their Council ordering them to pay their rent.

An image of a pound coin fizzing in a glass was accompanied with a sprig of holly and the words: 'Don't overindulge this Christmas. Pay your rent!'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has launched a particularly unusual Christmas card - featuring him and his wife Miriam with drawn-on antlers.
