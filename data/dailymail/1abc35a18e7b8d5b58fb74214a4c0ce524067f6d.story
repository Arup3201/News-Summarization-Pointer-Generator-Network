As if Marouane Fellaini scoring was not enough, West Brom have been made to further regret their half-time tweet during Monday's 2-2 draw with Manchester United - by German giants Bayern Munich.

With the Belgium midfielder warming up at half-time, West Brom posted: 'Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath #WBAMUN.'

And half way through Bayern's record-breaking 7-1 win against Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday night, the Bundesliga leaders jokingly posted their own half-time tweet about Franck Ribery.

The tweet read: 'Sub coming up: #Ribery has taken off his tracksuit, fortunately he has an #FCBayern strip on underneath. #ASRFCB 'FCBayernLive'. 

Like Fellaini, Ribery came on and scored as Pep Guardiola's men made it three wins in as many games in Group E.

But Bayern weren't the only team to mimic the tweet on Tuesday night.

Wolves also took time out half way through their 2-0 win over Middlesbrough in the Championship to poke fun at West Brom's gag, which was retweeted more than 21,000 times.

'Michael Jacobs has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Wolves strip on underneath,' the official Twitter account of Wolves wrote.

But their Black Country rivals had the last laugh, tweeting: 'Ouch, that was a low blow! Would be good to have you back. Come up and join us sometime. :-).'

West Brom backtracked after being criticised for having fun at £27.5million Fellaini's expense.

After the 2-2 draw, they tweeted: ‘Sorry if a joke about a footballer not having a shirt on under his tracksuit top has caused such outrage. It was not intended as a slur.’
