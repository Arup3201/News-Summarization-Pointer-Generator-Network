Anonymous has vowed to expose the identities of the four boys behind the rape of a 17-year-old girl who killed herself after they circulated a photograph of the assault.

The hacking collective said that they knew who two of the supposed culprits were and that they were confirming the identity of a third before putting them on the Internet.

In a post the group added that it was ‘only a matter’ of time before they got the fourth as well.

Tragic: Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, has killed herself after allegedly being gang-raped and then bullied

Anonymous said that it took action after police in Nova Scotia, Canada, charged nobody over the death of Rehtaeh Parsons.

There were also no charges for any of the boys for sending the pictures to their friends.

Phantom menace: The hacking collective said that they knew who two of the supposed rapists of Rehtaeh Parsons were

Once the picture was spread around 
Rehtaeh’s school she was subjected to brutal bullying on and off the 
Internet, which was so bad she had to move school and move house.

Anonymous has now called for a 
protest outside the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in
 Halifax, near where Rehtaeh lived.

In a separate development, a petition
 calling for an independent inquiry into the police investigation has 
also been started and has attracted 65,000 signatures.

Rehtaeh hanged herself in her 
family's bathroom on Thursday after months of torment and, on Sunday 
night, her parents took her off life support.

Questions are now emerging over 
whether authorities did enough to help the girl who relatives said 
quickly slipped from an A-student to a moody, unpredictable teenager.

An investigation was launched over 
the November 2011 rape but the RCMP says that there was not enough 
evidence for a prosecution, even for possession of indecent images of a 
child.

The Anonymous post is called ‘Operation Justice For Rehtaeh’.

It reads: ‘Anonymous has confirmed 
the identities of two of the four alleged rapists. We are currently 
confirming a third and it is only a matter of time before the fourth is 
identified as well.

‘Our demands are simple: We want the 
N.S. (Nova Scotia) RCMP to take immediate legal action against the 
individuals in question.

Twitter action: Anonymous has now called for a protest outside the headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Halifax as part of 'Operation Justice For Rehtaeh' on Twitter

‘We encourage you to act fast. If we 
were able to locate these boys within 2 hours, it will not be long 
before someone else finds them.

‘We do not approve of vigilante 
justice as the media claims. That would mean we approve of violent 
actions against these rapists at the hands of an unruly mob. What we 
want is justice. And That's your job. So do it.

‘The names of the rapists will be 
kept until it is apparent you have no intention of providing justice to 
Rehtaeh's family. Please be aware that there are other groups of Anons 
also attempting to uncover this information and they may not to wish to 
wait at all. Better act fast.’

It adds: ‘You will be held accountable for your failure to act.’

Anonymous has set up an email address and a Twitter hashtag #OpJustice4Rehtaeh to keep the story going.

The petition was set up on change.org by a woman called Sherri B from Halifax in Nova Scotia.

She said that it was not good enough that the RCMP investigated for a year but did nothing and asks: ‘How is this possible?’

The petition reads that ‘everyone saw
 her being bullied and shamed at school.’ It then goes on to say that 
‘Nova Scotia’s Justice Minister Ross Landry must call an independent 
inquiry into this situation.

Struggle: After she was allegedly raped, her attackers spread a photo of the assault around her school

‘The Minister must find out if the 
police ran this investigation properly and determine if there is 
important evidence that was not taken into account when they decided to 
close this case.’

On a Facebook tribute page, Rehtaeh's
 mother, Leah Parsons, described how her daughter was forever changed by
 the alleged assault in their hometown of Cole Harbour.

'She went with a friend to another's 
home,' her mother wrote. 'In that home, she was raped by four young 
boys. One of those boys took a photo of her being raped and decided it 
would be fun to distribute the photo to everyone in Rehtaeh's school and
 community, where it quickly went viral.

The alleged attack left then 
15-year-old Rehtaeh an outcast at Cole Harbour District High School, 
where her rapists were also students. Friends, students and strangers 
taunted her, her mother said.

'People texted her all the time, saying "Will you have sex with me?"' she said. 'Girls texting, saying "You're such a slut".

'She was never left alone. She had to
 leave the community. Her friends turned against her. People harassed 
her... It just never stopped,' her mother told CBC.

Sadness: Leah Parsons, Rehtaeh's mother, pictured, said she believes the police investigation was flawed

Family: The family even moved to escape the bullies, but she still struggled with mood swings

Her parents moved from Cole Harbour 
to Halifax to help her escape the bullies and Rehtaeh made new friends 
and began hearing from her old school friends, who offered her their 
support.

She said her daughter also started 
therapy, which appeared to be helping. Yet she would become angry 
quickly, and last week's suicide attempt was probably the result of a 
mood swing, Leah said.

'She acted on an impulse, but I 
truly, in my heart of heart, do not feel she meant to kill herself,' her
 mother wrote on Facebook. 'By the time I broke into the bathroom, it 
was too late.'

The Canadian police launched an 
investigation, which took a year, but concluded there was insufficient 
evidence to bring up charges.

'An investigation into an earlier 
sexual assault was completed, and in consultation with the Crown, there 
was insufficient evidence to lay charges,' RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott 
MacRae said.

They didn't even interview the boys until much, much later,' To me, I’d think you’d get the boys right away, separate them.”

Relatives said they saw the 
photograph but could not determine who had taken it, so were unable to 
charge the teenagers - even though the picture legally constituted child
 pornography.

'The whole case was full of things 
like that,' Leah said. We didn’t have a rape kit done because we didn't 
even know until several days later when she had a breakdown in my 
kitchen. She was trying to keep it to herself.'

Bullied: Rehtaeh eventually left the high school when even her friends turned on her, her mother said

Loss: Her family said they do not believe she wanted to die but that it was a spur of the moment decision

RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott MacRae 
confirmed to the Chronicle Herald that the authorities are currently 
investigating a sudden death involving a young person, but would not 
provide further details.

Her mother said she wants other 
people to learn from the tragedy and how social media allowed her to be 
continually violated following the brutal rape.

Rehtaeh shared her sadness on 
Facebook, including a post on March 3 which read: 'In the end, we will 
remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.'

Barrett Khan, a vice-principal at 
Cole Harbour District High School, told The Globe he couldn’t comment on
 the case as the teenager had left more than a year ago.

'Our thoughts are with the family 
during this difficult time,' a spokesman for the Halifax Regional School
 Board said in a statement. 'We are not going to respond directly to the
 family’s comments as we do not want to add to their grief.'
