It’s not policemen who look younger these days, their canine companions do too.

This bundle of law-enforcing fun was bred at the Metropolitan Police Force’s dog training unit at Keston in Kent.

It’s one of three of the first litter from Dutch Alsatian Etta, who was imported especially for breeding.

Some 100 dogs are born at the centre each year. They are then assigned to live with a policeman and his family.

They start their two-day a month training at around 12 months before joining the more than 2,500 police dogs working across the UK in roles ranging from sniffing for drugs or explosives, to helping in the search for missing people.

The dogs are trained on a variety of courses throughout their working lives – usually retiring around the age of eight to live with their handler.

But there’s a considerable amount of work to be done to transform these puppies from fun-loving balls of mischief to disciplined members of the force.

The first lesson might be not to chew on a police hat. Anyone biting a policeman or woman (assault) faces a maximum prison sentence of seven years.
