A 24-year-old woman and her 46-year-old boyfriend got their 15-year-old babysitter high on party drug meow meow and then pressured him into sex, a court has heard.

Nicola Mason from Rhydwyn in Holyhead, North Wales, stripped off in front of the boy and then forced him into a sex act while John Ford watched, it was claimed.

The boy was embarrassed and initially refused the advances but prosecuting barrister Myles Wilson said he eventually gave in.

Mold Crown Court heard that Nicola Mason (left) from Rhydwyn in Holyhead, North Wales, stripped off in front of the boy and then forced him into a sex act while John Ford watched (right), it was claimed

It was alleged that he was given the party drug to loosen his inhibitions. The couple each deny sex charges against the boy, who is now 16, and have accused him of 'making his story up out of thin air'. 

'The prosecution case is that the first defendant Ford gave the 15-year-old male boy drugs and pressured him to have sex with his partner, the second defendant Mason,' Mr Wilson told the jury at Mold Crown Court.

'Both these defendants, in effect, took advantage of a 15-year-old lad who was a virgin at the time. He lost his virginity by being pressured into it, with John Ford looking on.'

The first time was when the couple returned home after a night out.

The boy was on the sofa and took the view that they were under the influence, or drugged up.

Ford was alleged to have told the boy Mason 'was off her head' and 'you can do anything you like with her.'

Mr Wilson said that the boy felt nervous and out of his depth but Ford told Mason to strip off, and she did in the front room.

He claimed that Ford was persistent, almost taunting the boy, by saying 'you must be gay then' when he kept refusing the advances.

Ford told the boy that his girlfriend Mason (pictured) was 'off her head' and he could do 'anything he wanted' with her 

Eventually he said 'ok' and Mason undressed him, with Ford watching on it was alleged.

The prosecutor claimed that Ford had also offered him some cannabis.

The boy was at their home again two to three weeks later.

'It is important for you to realise that the prosecution case is not that he was forced completely into something that he was desperate to avoid. It is not as black and white as that,' Mr Wilson told the jury.

'The prosecution case is that he was under age and he was taken advantage of by grown adults who quite frankly should have known better. He was just 15.'

On the second occasion, he alleged that the defendants did not waste any time whatsoever.

When he arrived it was claimed that Ford took him upstairs to the main bedroom where Mason appeared naked.

She got onto the bed and it was alleged that Ford told the boy 'that's your bitch' and 'you can do anything you want.'

Initially the boy said no, he did not want to go through with it, particularly in front of Ford.

But Mr Wilson claimed that Ford would not take no for an answer.

So the youngster ended up having sex in front of Ford with Mason on the bed, it was alleged.

On this occasion, it was alleged that Ford had given him the illegal party drug MCAT.

'The prosecution say that what makes this worse is that Ford gave the boy drugs no doubt to try and gain his trust or loosen his inhibitions,'  Mr Wilson told the jury.

'It is the prosecution case that the defendants liked to involve other people in their sex lives,' he added.

'There will be evidence from other witnesses including a good friend of Ford that this is something they did, that Ford would encourage and let other men have sex with Mason,' he claimed.

The matter came out when the boy told his older brother. A woman who was looking after him at the time then heard about it and went with a friend to confront Mason.

The prosecution alleged that Mason broke down and admitted it had occurred, and claimed Ford had forced her into it.

She spoke to Ford on the telephone, and was alleged to have said: 'It is too late John, I have told them, I have told them everything.'

The witness listened on the phone and it was claimed that Ford, believing he was still speaking to Mason, said 'shut the f*** up Nicola' and 'you had better shut your mouth.'

It was the prosecution case that a friend of Ford's had asked him about rumours he had heard and that Ford was alleged to have admitted to him that it took place.

But arrested and interviewed, the both denied that any such thing had happened or that anything sexual had occurred with the boy.

They now accused the boy of 'making it up out of thin air'. 

In evidence the boy denied that he was a street wise lad but agreed that he had given evidence in the crown court previously as a defendant in a case of perverting the course of justice.

Ford denies two charges of inciting the child to engage with sexual activity with Mason and Mason denies two charges of sexual activity with a child.

The trial continues.
