Prince Charles has admitted that speaking his mind is ‘in his blood’ as he revisited communities in Somerset blighted by flooding earlier this year.

The heir to the throne was today meeting local residents in the village of Muchleney where, back in in February, he shamed both the Government and Environment Agency into finally responding to the crisis when he said: ‘The tragedy is that nothing happened for so long.’

Unlike his last visit, when he was forced to travel by boat and trailer, Charles arrived by car and marvelled at the once waterlogged countryside, covered in wildflowers and bathed in sunshine.

But the plight of locals on the Somerset Levels who were left stranded and isolated for weeks on end was clearly not far from his mind.

Although the future king is often lambasted for his so-called ‘meddling’ in national politics, in Muchleney they couldn’t have been more grateful for his stance after the ‘shameful neglect’ of the authorities earlier this year.

Among those queuing up to thank the prince was farmer Jane Pine, 59, of Meare Green Farm, who told him that his visit and subsequent lobbying to get local rivers dredged – blamed by many for the some of the worst flooding in generations - has achieved ‘more last February than we have achieved in the last ten years of campaigning’.

The prince replied: ‘Well I had to do something. It runs in the family. It’s in my blood.’ He added: ‘At least I’ve done some good.’

He also chatted at length to another elderly local farmer, Stanley Chedzoy, and his family who have now farmed Slough Court Farm in Stoke St Gregory for five generations.

His grandson, Anthony Gothard, said: ‘We had a really terrible year in 2012  as a result of the flooding and to have it happen again so soon after ploughing hundreds of thousands of pounds to keep the farm going was just devastating. We had to think seriously about whether we could carry on this year.’

Charles visited the family farm, which had  250 acres of land under water, back in February. ‘His visit genuinely got momentum behind the relief effort and he has clearly made an effort to keep that momentum going. We owe the prince a lot,’ Mr Gothard said.

Mr Chedzoy added: ‘The politicians weren’t listening, the Environment Agency weren’t listening. No-one was listening until Prince Charles came down. We have got to thank Prince Charles for a lot of that publicity we subsequently received here.’

Charles’s first visit of the day was to Glastonbury Abbey, where he was accompanied by festival organiser Michael Eavis, as part of a publicity drive to encourage tourists back to Somerset following the winter crisis.

Historic: Glastonbury Abbey is thought to contain the tomb of the legendary King Arthur

The
 Abbey, which sits on the edge of the Somerset Levels, is one of the 
most beautiful spots in the area and is home to the tomb of the 
legendary King Arthur and his Queen Guinevere.

Thought
 to have been the site of Avalon, Glastonbury is also associated with 
Joseph of Arimathea who is said to have founded the now ruined abbey in 
the first century.

More recently, the Abbey was used as the 
resting place for several Anglo-Saxon kings, among them the battling 
Edmund Ironside who fought off the Danes only to die shortly afterwards,
 leaving England to the tender mercies of King Canute and his Danish 
empire.

Then it was onto Muchleney where he met members of the local rural community at Almonry Barn, a 900-year-old wedding venue owned and run by the Wilson-Ward family.

Although the venue suffered less water damage than many properties it was completely cut off for weeks on end and with prospective clients unable to view the property has suffered a large downturn in bookings.

Louise Wilson-Ward, 29, said: ‘It was hell, to be honest. Very surreal being cut off for weeks on end unable to do anything about it and with no end in sight. The situation was horribly isolating.

‘When Prince Charles came down to visit us we thought things were on the turn but the next day the rains came back with a vengeance. ‘

Her mother Angela, 53, also explained: ‘We had been wandering around, aimlessly, for weeks on end, without knowing what to do.

‘I had been emailing everyone I could think of – the local council, the Environment Agency and even Downing Street but no-one bothered to reply. Then Prince Charles came to the area and suddenly, within 24 hours, everyone couldn’t reply quick enough. Except David Cameron – I never heard from him.’

Her daughter added: ‘We have been knocked really quite badly by what has happened. The place was derelict and hadn’t even been opened for six years when we took it over two years ago.

'It’s now the oldest wedding barn in England and has been a real labour of love. But no-one could get to us to view the barn and bookings have been hit.

‘It’s wonderful that the prince is continuing to take such an interest. The footage of the floods was undeniably shocking but we want to put out a message of recovery and hope.’

Although he arrived by car, Charles made a point of taking the train back to London for his evening engagement to highlight the quick links between London and Somerset.

The prince, who does not travel by rail very often, took his seat in a First Class carriage alongside astonished fellow travellers.

Unsurprisingly the train wasn’t late -  and arrived in London on time.
