It is drumming as you've never seen it before - and a unique way to 'see' music.

An ad agency created this incredible drumming video for Ballantine's using specially adapted drumsticks.

Timelapse photography was used to capture the sticks movement, while a 'Matrix style' camera rig was set up around the drummer Ben Mead to capture his in 260 degrees.

The team created a special 'time slice' camera rig which encircled the drummer to produce this stunning matrix-like effect of the drummer in mid flow

'Rhythm is the root of everything, I'm always looking for new ways to explore it,' said Brighton-born Mead.

'I've always wanted to see what rhythm might look like, to see the shape of sound,' he explained.

The video is part of an ad for whisky firm Ballantine's.

It developed special software to process the images captured and make the trails glow.

Drummer Ben Mead used special sticks with lights fitted to create the amazing effects.

The timelapse images were created for a commercial, along with a 'matrix' style scene which sees the camera moving around the drummer as he plays.

'In order to capture the stunning light trails, a bespoke application was developed C++ using the Cinder creative coding framework, taking a HD video feed from the main shoot camera and pulls out the LED-tipped drumsticks,' the firm explained.

'The trails are not computer generated, but come directly from the images from the camera, creating light trails of the desired length and intensity.

'In addition, a 360 degree â€˜time slice rigâ€™ was used by Ben and the team to capture the light trails in 3D.'

The team calibrate the system by asking Ben to drum slowly, before letting him lose with a full range of movement.
