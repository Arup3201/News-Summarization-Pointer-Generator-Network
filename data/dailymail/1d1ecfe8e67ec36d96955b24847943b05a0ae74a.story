SNP MP Angus MacNeil has written to Scotland Yard asking them to review new evidence of attempts to 'buy' a seat in the House of Lords

The MP who sparked the original ‘cash for honours’ investigation last night demanded a new police probe into claims that wealthy Lib Dem supporters had offered money to the party in an attempt to ‘buy’ seats in the House of Lords.

On Wednesday the party’s former treasurer Lord Razzall admitted he received such approaches from business people ‘several times a year’ but instead of reporting them he simply told them to ‘keep quiet’.

Last night SNP MP Angus MacNeil wrote to Scotland Yard asking them to review the new evidence, and insisted Lord Razzall had a duty to name the individuals to the police.

Mr MacNeil, who made the 2006 complaint about Labour’s efforts to secure peerages for wealthy individuals who had loaned the party money, said the peer’s comments amounted to a ‘smoking gun’.

He said: ‘Lord Razzall has to tell the police who these people are and then the police have to talk to them and take it from there.

‘It’s very straightforward really. This is not so much the smoke from a smoking gun as the actual gun itself.’

His call was backed by the former Westminster standards watchdog Sir Alistair Graham. Sir Alistair, who chaired the Committee on Standards in Public Life said: ‘He has a civic responsibility to report people who are attempting to break the law.

‘I suppose the reason that people don’t report it because they are hoping to get donations all the same,’ he told the Telegraph.

‘If they have made an offer, by my understanding, they have broken the law. I suppose in each case, you would want to ask, did the parties receive a donation from these people anyway?

The Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 makes it an offence to offer ‘any gift, money or valuable consideration as an inducement or reward for procuring or assisting or endeavouring to procure the grant of a dignity or title of honour’.

But Lord Razzall, who was in charge of Lib Dem finances for 12 years, appeared to think only actually giving someone an honour was a crime.

In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live was asked if he had been made ‘dishonourable’ offers. He replied: ‘Oh God, yes.

‘Anybody who has been a party treasurer of any of the three parties will tell you, if they are honest, that there are numerous people who came to you and said, “I will give you a million pounds as long as I can go into the House of Lords”.

He also said the treasurers of both Labour and the Tories would say the same.

‘There’s nobody to who that has not happened, and everybody knows what you have to say, which is, “I’m terribly sorry, that’s a criminal offence. Would you mind keeping quiet?”.’

Asked how often wealthy individuals attempted to buy honours over his 12 years as treasurer, Lord Razzall replied: ‘I should think several times a year.

Lord Razzall told BBC Radio 5 Live that wealthy people approached him regularly looking to buy peerages

Mr MacNeil complained to Scotland Yard earlier this year after comments made by former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott - who quit the party over a plot to oust Nick Clegg.

Lord Oakeshott said, ‘my efforts to expose and end cash for peerages in all parties, including our own, and help get the Lords elected have failed.’

Mr MacNeil said he was still waiting for a response from the police to that complaint. He added: ‘The Met need to review this new evidence, which highlights the depths of corruption in our second chamber.

‘Under the Westminster system, we have the ludicrous situation that there are far more legislators who are appointed than elected - and people in Scotland elect only 4 per cent of the Westminster parliamentarians who hold powers over the economy, welfare, defence, our place in Europe, and many other crucial areas of policy.

‘While the Liberal Democrats concede the House of Lords is out of date and undemocratic- they continue to stuff it with cronies. Labour are no better- they say they want a Senate but they continue to stuff the House of Lords with their own peers.

A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ‘We are not aware of any of the specific conversations Lord Razzall discussed.

‘As he made clear, any attempt to bribe a political party, and pay for a peerage is illegal. These are points he has previously made before select committee hearings, echoed by treasurers from other political parties.’

‘As the Labour cash-for-peerages scandal proved, anyone engaging in this activity should face the full force of the law.’
