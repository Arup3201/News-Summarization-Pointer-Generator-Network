David Cameron is considering a temporary withdrawal from the European human rights convention in order to finally remove Abu Qatada from Britain.

The Prime Minister held a ‘council of war’ with senior ministers yesterday to find a way of deporting the hate preacher to his native Jordan to face terror charges, according to sources.

Home Secretary Theresa May, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Attorney General Dominic Grieve were summoned for talks at Downing Street shortly before the Government discovered it had lost the latest round in an interminable legal battle to remove the terror suspect.

David Cameron is considering a temporary withdrawal from the European human rights convention in order to finally remove Abu Qatada from Britain

Remaining in Britain? Abu Qatada has won the latest court case today in his long running legal battle to avoid deportation

Sources said Mr Cameron had declared 
Qatada’s continued presence in Britain ‘intolerable’ and insisted even 
the most controversial options must be considered.

It is understood that one possibility is Britain 
temporarily leaving the European Convention of Human Rights – a move 
which would infuriate the Liberal Democrats and push the Coalition to 
breaking point.

Appeal: Theresa May had hoped to take the case against Qatada to the Supreme Court

Today the Prime Minister's officials spokesman refused to rule out the option of temproairily withdrawing from the ECHR.

He told journalsists: 'The Government
will explore every option in seeking to deport this dangerous 
individual and that's what we are going to keep doing.

'The Prime Minister met with the Home
Secretary, the Justice Secretary and the Attorney General yesterday to 
discuss the case, I'm not going to get into specifics as to what the 
Government is considering, as I say, we are going to explore every 
option.'

European judges have ruled that Qatada
would not receive a fair trial in Jordan but Conservative MPs have 
suggested that the threat of Britain pulling out of the convention would
persuade Strasbourg to back down.

The Prime Minister’s decision to put 
himself at the head of Government efforts to remove Qatada is high risk,
since he will now be blamed if they fail.

Mrs May is expected to announce new 
developments in negotiations with Jordan over his deportation when she 
makes an emergency statement to the Commons today.

Ministers have been trying for a 
decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a 
terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium.

His removal was originally approved by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human Rights last year.

Judges in Strasbourg said he would not
get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have
been obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal 
against this verdict.

Instead, she and her ministers secured
personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be no use 
of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in the UK 
legal system.

But last November, the Special 
Immigration Appeals Commission said it was not satisfied with the 
assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect 
the Strasbourg ruling.

That decision was last month upheld by
the Appeal Court and yesterday the same court refused permission for 
the Home Secretary to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court. The 
Government is to persist with its bid by applying directly to the 
Supreme Court for permission.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The 
Government remains committed to deporting this dangerous man and we 
continue to work with the Jordanians to address the outstanding legal 
issues preventing deportation.’

Still smiling: Labour and Conservative ministers have been trying to deport Qatada for a decade but have failed

In her statement to MPs today, Mrs May
will announce new developments in negotiations with Jordan over 
deporting Qatada. Home Office minister James Brokenshire is understood 
to have visited the country to secure fresh assurances that the preacher
will be treated fairly.

However, any new agreement would undoubtedly be subject to fresh appeals by Qatada.

At best, it would restart the legal 
merry-go-round, with the case going back through the British courts – 
and even returning to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

That could allow Qatada to remain in Britain for many years at taxpayers’ expense.

Qatada – who has been linked to a long
list of international terrorists – is currently in Belmarsh 
high-security jail for allegedly breaching his immigration bail 
conditions. It is feared the longer the case drags on the less willing 
judges will be to insist Qatada remains in prison and the more likely it
is that he will be allowed back out on to the streets.

Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab, a 
former human rights lawyer, said: ‘The last government made a major 
mistake in not deporting Qatada in 2009, when the UK Law Lords gave the 
green light.

‘Qatada has been running rings around 
the British justice system ever since. This case shows we urgently need 
to overhaul the law on deportation, scrap the Human Rights Act and start
standing up for British democracy rather than kow-towing to the 
European Court in Strasbourg.’

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper 
said after today’s decision was announced: ‘A year ago, Theresa May 
promised Abu Qatada would soon be on a plane.

‘Now it is clear her legal strategy 
has completely failed. The Home Secretary must tell us urgently what she
is going to do now to get Abu Qatada deported or tried, and keep him 
off our streets.’
