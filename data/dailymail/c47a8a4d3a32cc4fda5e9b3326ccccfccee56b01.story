Brave: Captain James Fidell, The Royal Logistic Corps, is decorated with The Queen's Gallantry Medal, for Services in Afghanistan by the Princess Royal. The soldier detonated a 110lb bomb without body armour

Without a thought for his own safety, and without bomb suit, helmet or body armour, Captain James Fidell battled for eight hours to defuse a 110lb bomb.

In the sweltering heat of a pitch black tunnel, a space so tight he was left with no option but to dispose of his protective gear, the 6ft5in solider had only one thing on his mind  'the job in hand.'

The bomb was found under a road to the north east of Gereshk in Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan. 

If detonated it would not only have killed him but destroyed the road above and had severe consequences for local people.

Now, the 29-year-old from the Royal Logistics Corps, has received the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his actions while on operation last year.

Capt Fidell, of York, said he was 'flattered' to receive the award from the Princess Royal on Wednesday but insisted that 'brave stuff' was being done every day by other service personnel.

He said: 'It is very flattering, it means a lot to me and to my family as well but I am massively conscious of the brave stuff that is done day in, day out.'

Capt Fidell decided to make the improvised explosive device (IED) safe rather than to blow it up.

If the the bomb been detonated, it would have damaged the local economy and made it easier for insurgents to plant more IEDs.

Asked what he was thinking when he was inside the tunnel, Capt Fidell told the Telegraph: 'You just deal with the job in hand and you are focused on that. You don't really have time to worry.'

The Royal Logistics Corps serviceman, from York, now works as an instructor teaching how to dispose of improvised explosive devices.

After the ceremony, he paid tribute to his 'brave' colleagues and admitted he had been 'surprised' by how hot and humid the tunnel had been.

He said he made the decision to take off his protective armour after seeing how confined the space was.

'Flattered': Capt James Fidell holds his Queen's Gallantry Medal Gallantry outside Buckingham Palace

The Upper Gereshk Valley is a Taliban hotbed in Helmand province, and has been dubbed the Valley of Death.

It is the most dangerous area after Sangin, where Britain has suffered a third of its fatal casualties.

Capt Fidell was just one of the servicemen and women being honoured at Buckingham Palace.

Others included Air Commodore Gary 
Waterfall, who was given a CBE for his role commanding the UK air 
contribution to the 2011 military intervention in Libya.

Architect Zaha Hadid, was made a Dame Commander for her work including the Aquatics Centre in the 2012 Olympic Park .

Former Chelsea defender Paul Elliott, who was awarded a CBE for services to equality and diversity in football.

Alison
Williamson, who has competed at six Olympic Games in archery, and 
Margaret Sanni-Alphonsi, the Saracens and England rugby player, were 
made MBE for services to their respective sports.

The Queen's Gallantry Medal is awarded to civilians for acts of exemplary bravery, and to military personnel for those acts for which military honours would not normally be granted, such as acts of exemplary bravery not in presence of the enemy.
