Novak Djokovic is known for his athletic ability, but we normally think about the world No 1 within the confines of a tennis court, not a dance studio.

But that is exactly where the 27-year-old was as he and his wife decided to try their luck at ballet in between matches.

The current Wimbledon and Australian Open champion posted a photo online of the couple together and wrote: 'Ballet with my wife'.

Serbia's No 1 beat Mate Delic in straight sets before emerging victorious in his doubles match too - teaming up with Nenad Zimonjic to beat Marin Draganja and Franko Skugor.
