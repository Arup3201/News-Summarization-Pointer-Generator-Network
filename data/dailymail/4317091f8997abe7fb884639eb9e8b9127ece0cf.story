A pair of climbers retraced the steps of the brave Brit who first conquered the deadly Matterhorn mountain in the Alps to pose for a unique 360 degree picture, which makes it look like they are - quite literally - on top of the world.

The high-altitude birds eye view photograph looks down on Stephan Siegrist and David Fassel as they stand atop the dangerous Swiss mountain.

A remarkable image, complete with the entire world in the background, it was taken with a Google Street View-style camera mounted on a selfie stick.

Once they reached the summit, they posed for a unique 360 degree picture, which looks like they are - quite literally - on top of the world

The men first had to climb the 15,000 foot mountain with six GoPro cameras chronicling their every move

The duo have created the illusion that they were standing thousands of miles above the Earth. 

Stephan said: 'With Project 360, we can continue what Google did in length and width with our camera, opening up a third dimension with a crystal-clear view down.'

The pair of expert mountaineers climbed the almost 15,000 ft mountain by retracing the steps of Edward Whymper.

Whymper was a British climber who led the first successful ascent in 1865.

The men initially decided to set out on the trek to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first successful climb of the dangerous peak

For generations, the Matterhorn was deemed impossible to climb due to its almost pyramidal peak and has climbed hundreds of lives

For generations, the Matterhorn was deemed impossible to climb due to its almost pyramidal peak.

Ever since it was first attempted, has claimed the lives of more than 500 mountaineers.

To mark the 150th anniversary of it being conquered, the climbers from the Mammut Pro Team retraced the steps of the early pioneers - and recorded their entire ascent of the north face of the mountain with six GoPro cameras.
