Two pork-loving couples have tied the knot at a mouth-watering bacon festival in Des Moines, Iowa. 

Tricia Snider and Tom Watson were the first to wed on Saturday at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival.

Craig Rouch and April Davila got married at the same festival a short while later.

Mr and Mrs Watson said the bacon festival was the perfect location to exchange vows because they enjoy eating bacon together every weekend. 

However, Mr Watson said his 41-year-old bride is nearly the number one love in his life.

'She's second only to bacon,' he said. 

The chapel where the couple married had a wall of windows that looked out over an arena full of vendors selling bacon-filled foods.

They exchanged vows about staying together 'in good times and bacon' but for the most part they kept their ceremony traditional. 

After the service, a cake topped with a bacon-strip bride and groom awaited the couple and their guests. 

The couple and their guests enjoyed eating pork loins wrapped with smoked bacon and spent time touring the exhibit halls at the festival.
