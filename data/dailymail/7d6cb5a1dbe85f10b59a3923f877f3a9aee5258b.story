Michelle Knight, one of three women held captive by Ariel Castro for a decade, made an appearance Wednesday at a rally for a missing Ohio man urging his parents not to lose hope.

Aaron Zimmerman, a mentally handicapped man from Lorain, vanished without a trace on the morning of November 14, a day before his 26th birthday.

His parents, friends and volunteers have spent the past three weeks scouring the streets of Lorain and the nearby woods in search of Aaron, who is said to suffer from schizophrenia and Asperger’s syndrome.

Inspiring figure: Kidnapping victim Michelle Knight attended a rally at the Church on the North Coast on Leavitt Road in Lorain, Ohio, for missing man Aaron Zimmerman

Gone: Zimmerman, 26, went missing from his home on Camden Avenue November 14

Zimmerman was last seen walking down Tacoma Avenue at around 8am November 14 after leaving his parents’ home on Camden Avenue without telling anyone, reported 19 Action News.

With snowy conditions and temperatures in the single digits, his parents, Rhonda and Dale Zimmerman, are concerned that he may have frozen to death. They are also worried that Aaron does not have his medications with him.

The Zimmermans say it is not like their son to take off without warning or stay out at night. He did disappear once before, but he was only 16 years old at the time.

On Wednesday evening, Michelle Knight appeared before a crowd of supporters at the Church on the North Coast on Leavitt Road in Lorain, encouraging them to continue searching for Aaron and pray for his return.

'My plan to come here was just to give them a glimmer of hope and just see them smile... [it] means the world to me,' an emotional Miss Knight said. 

Knight handed Aaron's mother a blue 'energy' ring telling her that she needs it during this difficult time.

Addressing Michelle Knight, Dale Zimmerman called the brave kidnapping survivor his 'blessing.'

'I asked for angels to come and here you are,' he said.  

Knight was kidnapped in August 2002 when she was 21 and spent the next 10 years in captivity inside Ariel Castro's Cleveland home.

In May 2013, Knight and her fellow hostages, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, broke out of the house after suffering years of torture and sexual abuse.

Castro pleaded guilty to a long list of charges and committed suicide in prison in September 2013.

Aaron Zimmerman is described as a white male, 5 feet 8 inches tall weighing 215lbs with brown hair and brown eyes.

People who encounter Aaron are asked not to approach him, as he may run away, and instead call police.
