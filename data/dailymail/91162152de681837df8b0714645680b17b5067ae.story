Some may consider it a cat nap too far, but Hello Kitty fans can celebrate the toy's 40th birthday in style in these themed rooms at a Los Angeles hotel.

The Line Hotel in LA's Koreatown has unveiled a host of themed suites complete with pink furniture, flower bathtubs, branded soap and toothpaste and even duvets made up of Hello Kitty toys.

The boutique design hotel has transformed several of its best rooms and a VIP lounge into a Hello Kitty wonderland just in time for a convention devoted to the toy - which was recently unveiled to be a girl not a cat as believed by fans for decades.

The Line Hotel in LA got a Hello Kitty makeover in honour of the cat's 40th anniversary. Pictured: the VIP lounge, complete with a sweet sofa, entitled 'Let them sit cake'

From bath mats and special toiletries to robes and pink cushions, the rooms are completely adorned with Hello Kitty paraphenalia

In one of the themed rooms, plush toys were bundled together to create a duvet

The wallpaper was custom-made by artist Kevin Hanley, who also shot the photos of girl pop band Nylon Pink

Designed by LA landscape architect Sean Knibb, these rooms prove that there is no such thing as too much of the Sanrio character.

From Hello Kitty toilet paper covering the walls to a mirror framed with stuffed toys, nothing was off limits when it came to tricking out the hotel's interiors.

The cartoon cat's face is plastered on the windows, bathmats and even bath robes to celebrate the Japanese kitten's 40th anniversary.

Miniature models adorn the bath tubs, ceilings and sink plugs as designers have gone all out in the kitten celebration.

Pinks and perfect: Guests can visit the suite to enjoy some quality Hello Kitty time even if the funds don't stretch to an overnight stay

Soaps, scents and even branded toothpaste are left in the bathrooms for Hello Kitty fans to enjoy

A goody bag was left in the rooms for Hello Kitty fans heading to the convention in the city at the start of November

In conjunction with the cute cat's creators - Sanrio - the boutique lodging was redecorated ahead of the first ever Hello Kitty fan convention.

One of the most creative additions? The VIP lounge's sweet cake couch, crafted by Vienna-based artist Dejana Kabiljo, from which visitors can take in the incredible LA-skyline views.

The VIP lounge is located in room 1219 on the hotel's 12th floor. 

The restaurant's chef, Roy Choi, who is also the man behind Koreatown's POT restaurant and The Line's Commissary, also created a special spam musubi in homage to the character.

The hotel's store, Poketo, is likewise selling Hello Kitty items and there are even themed Linus bikes available for rent in the lobby. 

The boutique hotel is located in the Koreatown area of Los Angeles and partnered with Hello Kitty makers Sanrio for the rooms

What could be better than a Hello Kitty accent wall above the sink... though using the mirror may be difficult

The Hello Kitty Convention, a four-day extravaganza devoted to the fictional character, which is held at MOCA's Geffen Contemporary Museum, kicked off on October 30. 

As the official hotel for Hello Kitty Con 2014, guests were able to choose between two different Hello Kitty-themed packages over the weekend of October 29 - November 2: the Sweet Stay and the Super Sweet Stay, which started at $219 and $304 respectively.

Fans were also offered the opportunity to tour the VIP lounge as part of the convention.

Those who booked in also received an exclusive Hello Kitty 40th anniversary welcome kit upon check-in, as well as invitations to Hello Kitty's birthday party, if they were staying at the hotel on November 1.

And for those who opted for the Super Sweet Stay, they were treated to even more Hello Kitty extravagance, including the opportunity to take home 'super-cute surprises' at the end of their stay, such as  bath soaps, bathrobes, bandaids, tech accessories, plush toys, and more.

Unfortunately, the Hello Kitty-themed rooms are no longer available for bookings, but the VIP lounge will be open until the end of November.

Knibb told Racked LA that he designed the space with a 'grown up and chic' aesthetic in mind

The rooms, which are only available to book for a limited time, sold out almost immediately
