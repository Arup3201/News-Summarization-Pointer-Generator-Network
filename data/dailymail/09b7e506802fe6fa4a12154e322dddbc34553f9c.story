The mother of a two-year-old girl suffering from leukemia has been left devastated after photos of her cancer stricken daughter were stolen and used on a fake account.

Melissa Clifton from Portland, Oregon, set up a Facebook page for her daughter Addy following the youngster's diagnosis in 2014 to keep loved ones updated about her progress.

However she was horrified when she learned the pictures were copied by a stranger and used on Facebook and Instagram accounts set up under a false name - Cooper. 

Treatment: Melissa Clifton set up a Facebook page for her daughter Addy (pictured) following the youngster's leukemia diagnosis in 2014 to keep loved ones updated about her progress. She later found out some of the pictures had been stolen and used on social media under a different name

Fake: The Instagram handle, @hopeforcooper (right), had more than 340 followers, and featured 38 photos of little Addy Cliffton, including one of her dressed as Elsa from Disney's Frozen. It has now been taken down 

According to ABC a child cancer advocate who was a member of Addy's Facebook group found the images and immediately alerted the family.

The Instagram handle, @hopeforcooper, had over 340 followers, and featured 38 photos of Addy.

Last week the Cliffords learned that the account had been removed from the site.

One person under the  name @sophiabenge_ claimed that 'Cooper' was her cousin when she uploaded the picture. Many users commenting on the photo suggested the profile was fake. 

The account however is still active.  

Following the discovery, the Cliffords kept searching the internet for other evidence, but couldn't find any. 

They also found no crowdfunding sites using Addy's images, suggesting they had not been used to generate financial benefits.

She told the station: 'I share pictures on there because I have family members and friends that live across the nation that want to follow Addy’s story.

'In the group there’s pictures of her in the bathtub at the hospital, visitations, her dressing up as Elsa from Frozen – pretty much doing normal, everyday things.

'They were our pictures, but someone had taken them and made a whole new story with them. I felt violated. 

'That’s my child. It’s not only wrong to pretend someone else’s kid is your own, but you’re claiming to go through something that's not even true.'

The station contacted Instagram for a comment but they did not respond.   

Anger: Mrs Cliffords (pictured right) said she felt violated after she discovered the pictures of her daughter had been used on fake Facebook and Instagram accounts 

Stolen: One person under the account name @sophiabenge_ claimed that 'Cooper' was her cousin when she uploaded this picture

Progress: Addy Cliffton has been fighting Leukemia at Dornbecher Children’s Hospital since August
