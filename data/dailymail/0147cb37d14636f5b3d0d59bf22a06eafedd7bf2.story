A two-bedroom luxury home in a desirable area is on sale for just £150,000  - but its new owner will have to be willing to adopt an aquatic way of life.

The rare 'Oxford Barge' dates back to the 19th century, and was formerly used by university rowers as a changing room and common room.

The floating accommodation, for sale on home retail site Zoopla, comprises two double bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open plan lounge and fully fitted kitchen.

Luxury: This two-bedroom 'Oxford Barge' is currently on the market for £150,000

Spacious: The rooms of the home have a homely feel despite being permanently on the river

Tradition: The barges would be used by Oxford college boat clubs for rowing races

A decked bow platform and ballustraded roof terrace - once used to watch rowing races - provide views of the river.

It is currently moored in Surrey, but the new owner will need to secure a permanent mooring along the Thames.

The barge was built in 1880, and is thought to be one of just six Oxford Barges left in existence.

The luxury boats have their origin in London's livery companies, which used them to show off their wealth during the annual Lord Mayor's Show.

Maritime: One of the bedrooms has a distinctly naval feel with its small port window

Views: The roof terrace allows the new owner to sit and watch the world go by

Domestic: The barge has its origins in the 19th century but is perfect for modern living too

However, during the 19th century the lavish vessels became so expensive to maintain that the guilds began to see them as too much of a burden.

The decline of the London barges coincided with the rise of rowing culture in Oxford, and college boat clubs rushed to snap them up.

Colleges used them for accommodation, storing rowing boats and changing rooms to protect the students' modesty.

Later, they were remodelled to hold dozens of spectators on their roofs for the college 'bumps' races.

Kitchen: The barge has been upgraded since its origins in 1880

Bathroom: Some might see the £150,000 price tag as a bargain for river-side accommodation

The example currently on sale was one of the last ever made.

Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said: 'With the history that comes with this stunning barge, buyers won't have to sacrifice character and charm should they decide to leave dry land behind and plump for a life on the water.

'The spacious interior layout, copious outside space and the flexibility to move your lodgings up and down river as you please means that, for the price, a home on the river can be extremely affordable compared to bricks and mortar.'

College Barges were originally built for London livery companies to use for river processions on the Thames in the 15th Century.

The character barge dating back to 1880 is believed to be only one of six known to be in existence now.
