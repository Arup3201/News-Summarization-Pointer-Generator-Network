The BBC is locked in a stand-off with MPs over its coverage of Europe.

Furious MPs accused director-general Tony Hall of putting the BBC 'above accountability' by refusing to answer questions from the Commons European scrutiny committee about the corporation's alleged bias on the issue.

Lord Hall was accused of 'hiding' behind historic rules that mean members of the House of Lords cannot be summoned to answer questions in the Commons.

David Cameron today urged Lord Hall to back down, saying that as a 'general rule' BBC executives should be willing to answer questions from MPs.

'The BBC needs to be, and is, publicly accountable,' he said.

Tory MPs said the stand-off raised questions about whether peers should be allowed to run major public bodies.

Conservative MP James Clappison said: 'It creates the impression that the BBC holds itself above accountability.'

Fellow Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'It makes it difficult for peers to be put in charge of public bodies if they are going to hide behind their privileges to avoid questioning.'

BBC chairman Rona Fairhead insisted Lord Hall could not answer questions about the corporation's coverage of Europe because it might threaten the BBC's independence in the run-up to the election. She insisted he was not using his privileges as a member of the Lords to stay away.

Mrs Fairhead said that a number of BBC news executives had already appeared before the committee to answer questions on the issue. And she said she was also willing to discuss the broad issues around the BBC's coverage.

But she claimed Lord Hall's position as the BBC's 'editor-in-chief' meant it would be wrong for him to face questions on politically sensitive issues because it could cast doubt on the corporation's 'independence'.

She told MPs: 'The director-general did not refuse to come because he is a peer. The question of independence is a very delicate one.

'There is a question of what is an appropriate level of scrutiny by parliament if the BBC is to remain independent.'

Under Parliamentary rules, Commons committees can require almost anyone to appear before them to answer questions. Those who refuse risk being found in contempt of parliament, which is punishable by a jail term. Tony Blair, who was dragged to the Commons this week to answer questions about Northern Ireland, is one of a number of reluctant witnesses summoned in recent years. But peers enjoy an exemption from the rules and cannot be summoned.

A decade ago, a major review by the former Cabinet Secretary Lord Wilson, reported a 'widespread perception' of 'certain forms of cultural and unintentional bias' in favour of the EU.

Mrs Fairhead said a number of changes had been made since, including the appointment of a dedicated Europe editor.

Richard Ayre, chairman of the BBC Trust's editorial standards committee, yesterday confirmed it receives numerous complaints about its European coverage - including eight separate cases over the last three years. But he said it had not upheld any complaints on the issue since at least 2007.

Lord Hall's refusal to attend was raised with the Prime Minister yesterday.

Tory MP Sir Roger Gale called for a review of the exemption for peers, saying: 'Lord Hall, is refusing to give evidence to another Select Committee on the grounds that he is a Member of Parliament. He is also a paid public servant. Is it not time that we reviewed the matter of parliamentary privilege?'

Mr Cameron replied: 'The general rule should be that people involved in the senior management of the BBC who are summoned to appear in front of a Select Committee should come, because the BBC needs to be, and is, publicly accountable. I think Lord Hall does a very good job at the BBC, and I am sure he would give a good account of himself, but I will have a careful look at it.'

A BBC spokesperson said: 'The Director General never has and never would use his membership of the House of Lords as a reason not to appear before a select committee. 

'The BBC is editorially independent and accountable to the BBC Trust for our broad coverage of issues. 

'The chairman of the BBC Trust will be appearing in front of the committee and we believe that this strikes the right balance between the BBC's independence and accountability to Parliament.'
