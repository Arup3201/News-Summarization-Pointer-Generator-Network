White House spokesman Jay Carney doubled-down on President Obama's assertion that the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, was 'phony scandal' - just days after the mother of one of the victims of the brutal attack appeared on Fox News to express how outraged she was that the president would refer to the attack as 'phony.'

For the last few weeks, 'phony scandals' has been one of the president's talking points when talking about the Benghazi attack as he criss-crosses the country giving speeches in support of his new economic plan.

'What we've seen, as time has passed and more facts have become 
known, whether it's about the attacks in Benghazi and the talking points
or revelations about conduct at the IRS, that attempts to turn this 
into a scandal have failed,' Carney said during a press briefing on Wednesday.

New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said in an interview with Fox News that the administration's latest comments are unacceptable. 

'His recently calling these phony scandals, that, to me, is 
incredibly wrong. It's misleading to the American people,' she said.

Frustrated by the glacial pace of the investigation into the September 11, 2012, attack that killed four Americans - including Ambassador Chris Stevens - eight Republican lawmakers sent a letter to new FBI Director James Comey demanding he make the Benghazi probe a top priority.

'Rumors continue to swirl about the whereabouts of suspects involved 
in the attack. The FBI continues to add pictures of potential assailants
to its website and asks the Libyan people to assist with identifying 
the alleged perpetrators. We struggle to understand why we don't know 
more about those who attacked two U.S. compounds and murdered four brave
Americans,' they wrote.

'It has been more than 10 months since the attacks. We appear to be 
no closer to knowing who was responsible today than we were in the early
weeks following the attack. This is simply unacceptable. We encourage 
you to be aggressive in your investigation to properly hold accountable 
those who attacked our compounds in Benghazi.'

Last week, the mother of one of the men killed in the attack blasted the president for describing her son's death as 'phony.'

'I don’t believe him anymore. He’s wrong. My son is dead. How could that 
be phony?' Patricia Smith, the mother of Foreign Service member Sean Smith, who was killed in the attack, said on Fox News’s Your World on Thursday. 'How can I
tell you? I mean it’s wrong. It’s not phony, it’s not fake. My son is 
dead and why is he dead? And all I’m waiting for, even to this date, is 
for someone to get back to me and tell me what happened.

'I begged them, please, I must know what happened with my son. How come 
this happened? They all promised me they would get 
back to me. And you know, not one of them, not one of them ever got back
to me in any way shape or form, not by a letter, not by anything other 
than I got a memo stating that I didn’t need to know because I was not 
part of the immediate family.'

The eight senators say they expect to be briefed on the investigation into the attack in 30 days.
