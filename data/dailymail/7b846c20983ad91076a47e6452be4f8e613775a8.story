Collectors are being offered the whole tooth about notorious gangland boss Ronnie Kray - by snapping up a set of his denture mouldings.

The mould was taken at Broadmoor high security hospital, Berkshire, for the around 1989 where Ronnie was serving 30 years for his crimes including murder.

Before he died there from a heart attack in 1995, he passed them on with other personal possessions to a nurse.

The collection of 22 items is being sold on line by London-based sale room PFC Auctions.

Ronnie and Reggie were both jailed for a minimum of 30 years in 1969 for their underworld dealings and the murders of two men, Jack ‘the Hat' McVitie and James Cornell.

Bisexual Ronnie was certified insane and spent the rest of his life in Broadmoor where he died aged 61.

It follows the sale of dominoes, a train set and an 
accordion which once
belonged to the notorious gangster brothers but went under the hammer earlier this month.

The 
unusual collection, which even also a set of Royal Doulton bunnykin 
figurines, attracted keen interest from Krays enthusiasts 
at the Greenwich Auctions Partnership in London.

The Krays achieved notoriety in the 1960s due to their ownership of West End nightclubs and criminal activities.

They mixed with many actors and musicians of the day, including Diana Dors, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland.

The darker side of the Krays' life was
their involvement, through their gang, in armed robberies, arson and 
protection rackets and murder.

They were arrested on May 9, 1968, and 
convicted in 1969. Ronnie Kray remained in Broadmoor Hospital until his 
death in 1995, while Reggie was released from prison just before his 
death from cancer in 2000.

Reggie's death attracted hundreds of 
mourners from throughout the East End, including current members of the 
criminal underworld.
