Real Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and James Rodriguez were both in attendance as super agent Jorge Mendes launched his new book 'The Key to Mendes' in Madrid on Thursday night.

The pair appeared in a relaxed mood at the event as they enjoyed an evening off ahead of their La Liga match against Cordoba on Friday.

Ronaldo and James were both represented by Mendes when they made their big-money moves from Manchester United and Monaco.

Ronaldo, who was crowned Ballon d'Or winner for the third time earlier this month, move to the Bernabeu for £80million in 2009, and James joined the club in the summer for £60m after starring in the World Cup in Brazil.

Mendes played a key role in both the deals and has represented players in many of the highest-profile transfers in recent years, including Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao last summer. 

It was revealed in the book earlier this week that Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, who is also represented by Mendes, was offered both Falcao and Di Maria last summer.

'Jorge [Mendes] told me Di Maria and Falcao are his players and he has to find solutions for them,' he said.

'But if Chelsea doesn't have the financial capacity to pay eight, nine, 10 million euros a year, because of Fair Play, of course Mendes has to think about his players.'

'I can't have a player earning €10m when others earn three, four or five. That would have caused an explosion.'
