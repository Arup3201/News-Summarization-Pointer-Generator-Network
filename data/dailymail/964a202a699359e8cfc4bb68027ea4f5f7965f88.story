Bolton-born boxer Amir Khan spent his Friday alongside some fellow natural born fighters as he enjoyed a family trip to a safari park in northern California.

Khan posed alongside, and also fed, a rare but dangerous white tiger as well posing with stunning giraffes and sea lions at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.

The 28-year-old was joined by his wife Faryal Makhdoom Khan as well as his daughter Lamysa as they all enjoyed some time off.

Earlier this week Khan ended speculation over his next opponent by announcing he will fight former light-welterweight world champion Chris Algieri on May 30.

Khan had come under increasing pressure to take on British rival and IBF welterweight champion Kell Brook in June.

However, Khan, who was also linked with bouts against Adrien Broner and Keith Thurman, said he was already deep in negotiations to fight somebody else.
