Tim Sherwood fears his friendship with Harry Redknapp will be damaged if he accepts an offer to become the new QPR manager before Saturday’s clash with Southampton.

Sherwood is mindful of a perception within the game that he had been lined up to replace Redknapp before his dramatic decision to quit Loftus Road just hours after the transfer window closed.

After working for him at White Hart Lane, Sherwood is likely to speak with Redknapp — who insists he quit because he needs two knee operations — before accepting an offer to succeed him at Loftus Road.

Queens Park Rangers have failed to pick up a single point in their 11 matches away from Loftus Road 

11 - No team had ever lost the first 11 PL away games before QPR this season. The last top-flight team to suffer that fate were Liverpool (1953-54).

8 - QPR’s home form is decent — W5, D4, L3 — but they have played all of the others in the bottom eight. They have away games at relegation rivals Hull, Aston Villa, Sunderland, Leicester, Burnley, West Brom and Crystal Palace.

128 - QPR have allowed more shots on target than any other team in the PL. They’re also the only team yet to score in the first 15 minutes.

There is an added complication because Sherwood is still being paid by Tottenham after insisting on an 18-month contract when he was promoted to replace Andre Villas-Boas in December 2013.

His £1m-a-year deal expires in May, but Sherwood will hope QPR and Spurs chairman Daniel Levy can agree terms. Sherwood has been linked with a number of jobs in recent months, including West Brom, Crystal Palace, Reading and Brighton, but QPR appears to be the perfect set-up for him.

On Wednesday, his friend Les Ferdinand, who also had a role under Redknapp at Spurs and was Sherwood’s assistant at White Hart Lane, was promoted to the role of director of football.

Ferdinand, who returned to Loftus Road at the request of chairman Tony Fernandes, is now responsible for the entire football department.

He has already recommended Sherwood for the manager’s role, but Fernandes will have the final say. In a series of tweets, the chairman said: ‘We will hire someone who cares, thinks long term, wants to be involved in developing the academy, has coaching skills, will play young players and is a winner. The names fans are mentioning to me are names that we are going to consider.’

Fernandes added: ‘I’ve been really impressed with the job Les has done in his short time here. This is a new strategy for us. Our recruitment policy is changing.

‘The recent addition of Ryan Manning to the Elite Development Squad is a sign of what we will be trying to do here. We want to develop a philosophy of buying young, hungry players, who can go on to forge decent careers with us.

‘I can reassure all Rangers fans that we are putting the building blocks in place to move things in the right direction.

‘We’ve made a number of mistakes in the transfer market over the last few years and it’s something we want to change. We don’t want to be a buying club — we want to nurture young talent and build a young, ambitious team.

‘Premier League survival is our priority in the short term, but in the medium and long term we want to make sure everything is in place, from the academy upwards, to create a culture and philosophy within the club that QPR fans can be proud of.’
