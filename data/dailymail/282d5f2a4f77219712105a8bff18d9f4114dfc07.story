At around 20 weeks scan new parents often succumb to the temptation to discover the sex of their unborn baby.

But for Beverley Winter and Ben Platt, the mezmerising 3D image of their son, revealed more than they imagined.

The shocked couple were taken aback at their son's heart-shaped head. 

'It was a shock,' said Miss Winter, from Stockport. 'I looked at my fiancé Ben and we both asked if it was going to stay like that.'

When Beverley Winter and Ben Platt had a scan to discover the sex of their unborn baby they were shocked to discover he appeared to have a heart-shaped head

Maternity staff on hand quickly reassured the worried couple - their baby's head had not yet developed properly.

Little Logan was born safely in September, and the ultrasound image has now become a treasured memento.

'We had the scan done to see what sex the baby was,' Miss Winter said.

'A heart-shaped head is not something you see everyday, it was actually my mum who spotted it first. But I love it.

'It is so amazing and makes him so unique, he is Britain's most loved baby.  

'The scanners said it was because the head hadn't developed properly. I was just relieved he was a healthy baby.'

By the time Logan was born on September 8, his head had formed properly, much to Miss Winter and Mr Platt's relief.  

Sadly, the pair had suffered a miscarriage the previous year. And they faced a tense few days when Logan was born with an infection.

But after a week in hospital he was back at home with his  family.

Miss Winter, added: 'After our miscarriage I was so frightened of losing Logan.

Maternity staff quickly reassured the couple, from Stockport, that their son's head was still developing. Baby Logan was born on September 8 with a normal-shaped head

'We had been trying for a baby for so long. The heart-shaped head thing is very fitting as we wanted him so much.

'We have put all the scans and photos in a book for him when he is older.

'He is really good now, and is a smiling, healthy baby boy.'

It is thought that the heart-shape was due to the angle the scan was taken at, and possibly fluid covering part of Logan's head.

The heart-warming image comes just weeks after other proud families showed off 4D ante-natal images which appeared to show babies laughing and smiling in the womb.

It was revealed last month how little Leo Hargreaves appeared to be chuckling away in his mother, Amy Clegg's tummy.

Amy and partner Leighton Hargreaves, from Accrington, shared the image after being bowled over by the 31-week scan.
