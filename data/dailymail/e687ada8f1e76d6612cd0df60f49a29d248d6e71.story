Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, is firmly in favour of three-parent babies

I fear I will be in trouble once again with some the Church as I find myself, in conscience, having to go against the line churches are taking on so-called three-parent babies. 

I am, to be clear, firmly in favour despite opposition from some of my colleagues and a powerful lobby of critics from abroad. 

A Commons Bill passed earlier this month will allow for a procedure in which a small proportion of a third person’s DNA is used to create an embryo in order to prevent potentially fatal genetic disorders.

Scientists have found techniques to replace faulty mitochondrial DNA – mitochondria are energy-generating structures in human cells – with donated DNA, and Britain is set to be the first country to endorse the practice.

It has proved hugely contentious. Yesterday 55 Italian MPs asked our House of Lords to reject the Bill, claiming the consequences ‘cannot possibly be contained’ within the UK. But this sort of opposition is unfathomable to me. 

This is an exciting medical intervention for families suffering rare conditions which prevent them from having children naturally.

The idea of ‘three-parent babies’ is a distraction because the mitochondria are a mere fraction of what makes us human. This is much more like an organ transplant.

Only one in 5,000 Britons suffers from mitochondrial conditions but an estimated 2,500 women are carrying these faulty cells which could be passed on to their children.

Vicky Holliday is likely to be one of the first to receive this new treatment. She already has a daughter, Jessica, who has Leigh syndrome caused by her mother’s faulty cells. 

Vicky loves her daughter but knows she will never walk or talk and is likely to die as a result of organ failure. She says: ‘When you are given the worst possible news it helps to have a little bit of hope. It would mean so much to us to be able to have a healthy child.’

Let us be in no doubt, the new techniques, the result of amazing research at Newcastle University, offer hope to those families who are at the mercy of such a terrible condition. 

They are now being given hope through the donation of healthy DNA – a technique that could prevent their children suffering a gradual and painful death.

Viscount Ridley, the science writer and a supporter of the technique, has accused the churches of leaving families in great pain and suffering.

He has written: ‘Surely… most church-going folk are not in the business of denying people hope merely to avoid the remote theoretical possibility of – well, of what exactly? I still cannot see a reasonable objection to this magnificent piece of technology in the service of human compassion.’

I have to agree. It is heartbreaking to see the churches once again opposing medical advances which have the potential to end great suffering.

Living in hope: Vicky Holliday passed faulty DNA to her daughter Jessica. The baby now has Leigh syndrome

Compassion is at the heart of the Christian faith. The love of God and of our neighbour comes first and last. The link between faith and healing is very close. Look only at the number of hospitals named after saints.

I long for the Church to end what some scientists feel is an overly negative opposition to extraordinary medical advances. One of the first steps is to address realistically the issue of pain at the end of life which has led so many of us to call for assisted dying.

But it is time also for the churches to approach science and medicine more positively. The Church risks being seen as irrelevant. Conservative Christians have opposed transplants, IVF, embryo experimentation and stem cell research.

Furthermore, the Church and science are always portrayed as being at odds even though this is often a misreading of history. Thankfully, most Christians are not flat-earthers. 

We embrace modern science and the vast majority of its developments. The Church of England has long been involved in the ethics committee of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). We have resisted the notion that every single development is a ‘slippery slope’ to one peril or another.

The primary motive must be compassion and the relief of suffering.

So why have we become trapped in doubt and fear about medical advances involving the beginning of life? I am constantly puzzled that Christians who believe in a gospel of hope find themselves in a perpetual state of opposition to scientific gains.

The Bishop of Swindon, Lee Rayfield, who played a key role in the consultation, is largely supportive

The truth is that in spite of a few reservations about whether hereditary characteristics would be affected by the technique, there are absolutely no grounds for opposition.

The Bishop of Swindon, Lee Rayfield, who played a key role in the consultation, is largely supportive. 

He said recently: ‘This has to begin with compassion. Compassion towards those who are sick and suffering and for those who long to bear children.’

He wants there to be proper safeguards. I agree. But let us remember that this week in the Lords we are being asked to agree regulations to enable the HFEA to consider each family’s treatment on a case-by-case basis, taking expert advice into account. 

Our country has an enviable tradition of responsible and thorough testing of research, and we can trust these experts to continue their painstaking work to enable families affected by serious mitochondrial disease to have healthy children.

The main opposition is not from the Church of England, and I find it surprising that bishops seem to be preparing to support a delaying motion from the Roman Catholic peer Lord Deben.

It would be received by families as a cruel and unnecessary delay after seven years of investigation, consultation, parliamentary discussion and scrutiny. 

I respect the Catholic position but it is an absolutist position with no room for compromise.

Like most peers I have received many emails and letters on the issue.

Much opposition is coming from well-organised campaigns from Catholics from Latin America and Eastern Europe. But if we cannot make any alteration, then we will deny ourselves the possibility of ever improving life for those who suffer from these intractable conditions.

Turning our backs on these advances is uncaring and unloving. We live in an exciting time for medical research and we must support caring scientists and doctors with the resources and proper regulations to do their work.
