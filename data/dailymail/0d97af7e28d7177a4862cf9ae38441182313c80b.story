New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez paid $305,000 to buy evidence and hide potentially incriminating links to Biogenesis, the Florida clinic behind baseball's doping scandal, according to testimony during arbitration to overturn his doping ban.

As the proceeding to end the dispute between Major League Baseball and Rodriguez reached its halfway point on Friday, it was revealed A-Rod handed over cash for documents that included videotapes and affidavits that could incriminate him or be used in defense against doping allegations, the New York Daily News reported.

Rodriguez is fighting the 211-game ban handed down by MLB in August to Rodriguez and 13 other players for violating doping regulations in the league's collective bargaining agreement.

Rodriguez is the only player contesting the ban and can play for the Yankees during his appeal.

New York Yankees' star Alex Rodriguez, pictured here (center) arriving at the offices of Major League Baseball in New York at the beginning of hearings to overturn his 211-game suspension, paid $305,000 to buy evidence from disgraced Florida clinic Biogenesis, according to a source

A source with knowledge of the closed-door proceedings, held in MLB's New York Park Avenue offices, told the Daily News that A-Rod and his representatives confirmed during sworn testimony that Rodriguez forked over the $305,000 to buy the evidence from Biogenesis - a claim that boosts MLB's case against the fallen star.

But with MLB seemingly set to strike out Rodriguez, A-Rod's team hit back with a counter claim that the league also paid cash to Biogenesis for its own evidence in the case.

The New York Post claims its own source revealed that MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred testified on Thursday that he authorized a payment of $125,000 in cash in return for documents from the Florida clinic.

Anthony Bosch, former boss of South Florida anti-aging clinic Biogenesis, is the star witness in the MLB case against Rodriguez. It has been alleged Biogenesis supplied baseball superstars with banned substances

But A-Rod's legal team denied the allegation the 38-year-old third baseman paid any money to acquire data from the disgraced anti-aging clinic.

'The notion that we paid any money for any Biogenesis documents is patently false, and anyone who is leaking this information knows it’s false,' said A-Rod attorney Joseph Tacopina.

But a third source told the Post the tit-for-tat claims over cash payments was all about the detail. Rodriguez apparently did acquire copies of Biogenesis information but did not pay for it, a point that shows just how much the he-said she-said desperate details of the proceeding have turned ugly.

Alex Rodriguez strikes out against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium in September. His 211-game ban is not in effect while he appeals the decision. A-Rod's career could be on the line as the MLB doping dispute gets ugly and uglier

A Post source claimed Manfred's testimony stated a member of MLB's investigation team made one payment of $100,000 and a second payment of $25,000 to Gary Jones, a former Biogenesis employee, for information stolen from Biogenesis founder Tony Bosch.

After receiving his 211-game ban based on connections to Biogenesis, Rodriguez sued MLB and included in his filing that: 'Dan Mullin of MLB purchased what were represented to be these stolen documents for $150,000 in cash, which was handed off in a bag at a Fort Lauderdale, Florida area restaurant.'

MLB denied those allegations and said: 'None of those allegations is relevant to the real issue: whether Mr. Rodriguez violated the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.'

Major League Baseball COO Rob Manfred said that if the league did buy evidence from third parties it was to reveal the illegal activities of players

Manfred said MLB buying evidence was legal.

'There is nothing wrong with purchasing documents in an investigation,' he told the Daily News. 'We did it in the course of trying to see if we had players using performance-enhancing drugs in violation of our agreement. I’ve acknowledged it previously.'

Arbiter Frederic Horowitz is expected to rule in December whether Rodriguez’s suspension by MLB will be hit out of the park or stand firm.

If confirmed, the ban will be the longest in MLB history.

A-Rod's career - and legacy - depend on the decision.
