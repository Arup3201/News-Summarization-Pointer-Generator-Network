Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef is serving a life sentence at the ADX supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, for masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing

The convicted terrorist who planned and carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing - who has been in isolation for more than a decade - has filed a lawsuit to end his solitary confinement.

Ramzi Yousef, 45, has been imprisoned since his capture in Pakistan in 1995 - two years after he killed six people and injured 1,000 others after detonating explosives beneath the North Tower.

Since the September 11 attacks, the 45-year-old Pakistani national has 
been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the 
federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies.'

Yousef says that despite good 
behavior while behind bars, he remains in solitary solely because he is a
terrorist - which he claims is a violation of his due process rights.

In
a letter to the prison's warden obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Yousef says: 'I 
request an immediate end to my solitary confinement and ask to be in a 
unit in an open prison environment where inmates are allowed outside 
their cells for no less than 14 hours a day.'

'I have been in solitary confinement in the U.S. since February 8, 
1995, with no end in sight... I further ask not to be in handcuffs or 
leg irons when moved outside my cell.'

The Times reports that Yousef doesn't even see the prison's guards, who push his meals through a small slot between two steel doors.

The only other inmate within the sound of his voice is reportedly a man who has killed others while incarcerated.

In August, Yousef's attorney Bernard Kleinman said his client wanted out of solitary because he was 'lonely' - and claimed that despite the World Trade Center attack, the 1994 bombing
of a Philippine jet, a plot to kill Pope John Paul II and other plots - Yousef is 'no longer a threat.'

Isolation: Since the September 11 attacks, Yousefl has been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, which is known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies'

Damage: This is the hole that was blown in the basement of the World Trade Center by the truck bomb Yousef detonated

Catastrophic: Yousef had hoped the bomb blast would collapse the one tower into the other and bring both crumbling down

'I think it's just plain unfair,' Kleinman said outside court at the time. 'Most of the terrorists he knew are either dead or in jail.'

Yousef was sentenced to life in prison
after he was convicted in the World Trade Center attack, as well as a plot to bomb 12 American 
airliners over the Far East.

At his 1998 sentencing, Yousef defiantly proclaimed: 'Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.'

His uncle is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11 terror atrocities that destroyed the World Trade Center towers and left nearly 3,000 people dead.

Wounded: More than 1,000 people were injured in the World Trade Center attack

Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef bragged that he was a terrorist at his sentencing in 1998. Now he says he's lonely

He fled to the Middle East the night of the
bombing and was captured two years later in Pakistan, where he was 
turned over to the FBI. He now lives in a 7-foot by 11-foot cell with a 
radio, a television, a desk, a toilet and a shower, Kleinman said.

Since
1997, he has been subjected to special administrative measures reserved
for prisoners who are believed to be a continuing threat to the 
country.

The restrictions prevent Yousef from 
communicating with other prisoners and only allow him to meet with his 
lawyer, Kleinman said.

For those visits, Yousef is shackled and forced to communicate through 
Plexiglass.

The prison is also home to Unabomber Ted
Kaczynski, Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nicholas, 
'underwear bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and 'shoe bomber' Richard 
Reid.
