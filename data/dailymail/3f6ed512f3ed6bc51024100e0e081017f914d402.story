The pole dancer girlfriend of the NSA whistleblower is so distraught over his fate that she is only just 'holding on', her father has revealed.

Jonathan Mills said Lindsay is so upset over what will happen to Edward Snowden she has not even phoned him - and instead has gone to ground.

Father and daughter have only communicated by text in which she told him she is ‘holding up as well as can be expected’.

In his first interview since the story broke, Jonathan also revealed that he has already forgiven Snowden for putting his family through hell - even though his daughter faces arrest and a possible prison sentence.

Jonathan’s disclosure gives fresh insight into the agony that Snowden’s decision has inflicted upon his girlfriend of five years, who he had considered marrying.

Lindsay, 28, had previously written on her blog about how she was ‘adrift’ at losing Snowden, 29, who she described as her ‘mystery man’.

He is currently in hiding out in Hong Kong having leaked secrets about the National Security Agency's PRISM programme, which monitors millions of American citizens, to the media.

Family members have said that Lindsay is currently with friends on the West Coast, though she could still be in Hawaii, where she and Snowden had been living together.

Jonathan, 48, spoke outside his suburban home in Laurel, Maryland, with a look of resigned fatigue on his face.

Wearing a light blue polo shirt and khaki trousers, he said he last saw his daughter two months ago when she came home to visit for a week.

'My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass,' Lindsay Mills writes about being suddenly left by NSA whistle blower Ed Snowden. Mills describes spending time with her mystery man, who clearly resembles Snowden

Jonathan said: 'I've met Ed. He's very nice, shy reserved. They've been dating four or five years.’

Asked if he was surprised at what Snowden did, Jonathan said: 'It wasn't out of character. He's always had strong convictions of right and wrong so it kind of makes sense, but it was a shock’.

Jonathan was not even angry that he was being put in this position, saying ‘alright, I understand'

He said that he did not know if his own views or those of his daughter - who dislikes the surveillance state - had any influence on Snowden.

He said: 'Lindsay is holding on. I've not spoken to her. She's holding up as well as can be expected'.

Asked if he knew where she was, he said: 'I have no idea'.

Earlier a blonde woman in her 50s thought to be Jonathan’s girlfriend went into his house and claimed to be the best friend of Lindsay’s’ mother Martha.

She said: ‘He (Jonathan) has nothing to do with it and she (Lindsay) has nothing to do with it’.

Since Snowden leaked the data he has effectively brought an end to any future he hoped to have with his girlfriend.

The pair seemed blissfully happy even though they appear to be totally different people.

She is an extrovert who enjoys walking around naked whenever she can, spends her Sunday evenings in circus classes and surrounds herself with bohemian eccentrics.

The title of her blog reads: ‘Adventures of a world-traveling, pole-dancing super hero.'

Snowden by contrast is a shy computer geek from a suburban family who likes to spend Sundays at football games and needed to be coaxed out of his shell to even do karaoke.

On Monday she took to her blog - where she has posted dozens of photos of herself semi-naked  - to tell of her heartbreak.

She wrote: 'My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass.

'As I type this on my tear-streaked keyboard I’m reflecting on all the faces that have graced my path.

'The ones I laughed with. The ones I’ve held. The one I’ve grown to love the most. And the ones I never got to bid adieu.

Better times: Lindsay Mills seen here with Ed Snowden before he suddenly took off for Hong Kong after leaking confidential information

This photograph of a Hawaiian sunset was taken by Mills recently. She has taken to her blog to write about her regret over how 'sometimes life doesn't afford proper goodbyes'

Miss Mills has not spoken to her father since the earth-shattering revelation about her boyfriend on Sunday

‘But sometimes life doesn’t afford proper goodbyes.'

It was an awful turn of events for Mills who had lived with Snowden since at least 2009, when they were in Japan together.

Last year he whisked her 8,000 miles from their home south of Baltimore, Maryland to Hong Kong where family friends thought they got married because it was a 'special place' for them.

Snowden fled to a luxury hotel Hong Kong weeks ago after he decided to release the secret documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. 

He never told Mills about his plan - saying only that he needed to leave for a few weeks and offering a vague explanation.

When he revealed his identity in the Guardian on Sunday, he said he expected he might never see his family again.

The shocking leak of classified surveillance programs has sent shockwaves through the nation. Some have hailed Snowden as a hero. Several high-profile members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, are calling his act treasonous and demanding he be arrested.

His whereabouts are currently unknown after he checked out of his luxury hotel on Monday - though he is believed to still be in Hong Kong.
