Supermarket Aldi has launched a maternity clothing range - meaning the Duchess of Cambridge could snap up everything she needs for just £50.

While it is highly unlikely that Kate will need to watch her budget for baby number two, many expectant mothers will welcome the news. 

The discount store's cut-price maternity fashion range includes leggings, a nursing bra, feeding top, maternity dress and baby changing bag.

The range is a first for supermarket Aldi, and will no doubt be welcomed by cash-strapped expectant mothers

The entire cost of the five items is just £50.95.

The recommended retail price of similar items on the high street would come to a total of £110  - more than twice as much.

The new range has been introduced a week after Clarence House announced the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their second child.

Ladies maternity leggings - £6.99

A baby changing bag for £14.99 completes the new range, which goes on sale on September 18.

Tony Baines, Managing Director for Corporate Buying at Aldi, said: 'At Aldi, we're constantly developing our offering to present our customers with competitively-priced products.

'This includes clothing, without compromising on quality.

'The launch of our new maternity wear range offers mums-to-be a range of stylish, great quality clothing and accessories at affordable prices.
