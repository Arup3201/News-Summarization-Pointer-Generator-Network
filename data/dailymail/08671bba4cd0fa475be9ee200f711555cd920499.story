Julie is also known by her performance name Bella and her most popular fattogram stripper outfits include a policewoman and schoolgirl

Having completed more than 400 shows during her career regularly as a schoolgirl or policewoman, she often performs in the Newcastle area and travels to Sydney where she does up to four shows on a weekend in clubs, hotels penthouses and private residences.

Bella said she took up fattogram stripping after a conversation with a friend.

'A friend of mine asked if I would be interested in doing it,' she said. 'I have small children so I thought I don't want to do anything that would jeopardise myself.'

'Taking the top part of my clothing off and getting paid $400 - I thought why not.'

Shortly after the conversation she joined a stripping agency in the Newcastle area, which has since closed down but she now works for a few different agencies including Damien's Party Entertainment.

Bella said she does not offer X-rated shows like traditional 'skinny' strippers, yet can still command $390 for a 15-minute show if she travels to Sydney.

She is is also regularly part of radio promotions and competitions and photo shoots.

During her career, the fattogram stripper has done more than 400 shows including bucks parties and 18th and 21st birthdays

The Swansea mother said her shows were not X-rated, although she foes take her top off

Bella does shows in the Newcastle area as well as travelling to Sydney for work, where she also does club performances

'Skinny strippers have to do more than what I have to do for less money,' she said. 'I'm more of a novelty stripper and I can charge more because of it.'

'I come in, give them (clients) a bit of fun and I'm not so serious. Normal strippers won't let you take photos or take videos, but I let them take it all - I don't care. They say: "Oh my God you're so cool".'

However Bella does perform topless and mixes her shows up by incorporating whips, chains and gag balls. 'I'm different to an everyday stripper,' she said and added her performances were in high demand.

'Most people forget a skinny stripper's name, but everyone remembers mine. People still talk about me for ages after they see me - and it's all good.'

The mother-of-two said while performing she was focused on her work and making sure everyone has a good time.

'I go do my thing and then leave,' she said. 'Sometimes I'm asked to hang around and drink and party, but obviously I've got other shows to do... otherwise I'd love to party.'

Earlier this year Bella was part of a KIIS FM radio promotion in Sydney with breakfast hosts Kyle and Jackie O, where callers had to correctly guess if the hosts were telling the truth about a fattogram

Thanks to word of mouth, Bella said popularity for her shows was soaring and she has even had invites from cafes asking her to perform for an evening.

'I'm starting to get a good reputation of being a good performer,' she said.

She regularly performs at buck nights, 18th and 21st birthday parties. 'Parents book me for birthday parties for something different,' Bella said.

The most bizarre thing she has been asked to do was motorboat some women. 'They actually liked it, it was at their request,' she said.

'I've done a couple of lesbian parties - they loved me. I'm open to anything except bestiality,' she joked.

While Bella said the feedback from her performances was overwhelming positive, there have been occasions when she has had to leave.

Bella said the feedback from customers was generally overwhelmingly positive. She is pictured left with Aaron Wheelz Fotheringham at a Nitro Circus show, and right she was taking part in a NXFM radio promotion dressed in costume as a policewoman

'People have made me feel not the best and not showing them, I've walked out crying,' she said. 'Throwing full pizzas, lollies - it's degrading by throwing food at you.'

Bella said out of 400 shows, only 10 have been a degrading experience, with the worst happening about three years ago.

'I quit (fattogram stripping) for a month... down at Terrigal I was trapped in a house,' she said. 'Food was thrown and a beer bottle at my head.'

Bella said she eventually got out of the house after she broke down in tears and her clients let her go as a result.

'It (the bottle) cracked my head. They were jerks. I quit and then I thought down the track, if I quit and don't go back then they have won and I didn't think that was fair. I've been stronger then ever since.'

The fattogram stripper said she has always been overweight and due to medication she takes for a bipolar disorder, this causes her to put on even more.

'I'm an emotional eater. If I'm happy or if I'm sad, I eat,' she said.

The 42-year-old became a fattogram stripper after a friend suggested it and said it pays her bills and she loves it

Yet four years ago she had lap band surgery and lost about 130 kilograms - nearly half her body weight. 'I've still got a bit to go,' she said. 'I'm six foot two, so it hides quite well.'

'My health is not deteriorating and I'm pretty healthy so I'll keep going (stripping) until I can't anymore... the doctor is not worried about my heart so medically I'm fine to keep going.'

'Doing thee to four shows every weekend, you need to be a bit fit.'

Two years ago she underwent another procedure to tighten the band and Bella said if she does this a second time, she could easily loose another 40 kilograms in a couple of months.

While some my find her career choice unconventional, Bella said she had the support of her friends, family and even her children.

'My little boy is just finding out recently - I don't think he has a problem,' she said. 'My daughter comes with me to jobs and helps me carry my stuff.'

'My friends and family think I have guts to be doing what I do. My parents were a bit "Oh my God", at first.

One of the agencies Bella works for also offers dwarf strippers and gorilla singing telegrams

'It pays my bills, I get the children what they need and I'm not harming anyone.'

Bella appears in Not Your Usual Strippers as part of Outsiders Week on The Feed, tonight 7.30pm on SBS 2.

Presenter Jeanette Francis said her understanding of a fattogram before meeting Julie was similar to most people.

'The only thing I knew about fattograms was what the average person knows... they are a form of entertainment, hired for bucks and birthdays,' Ms Francis said.

'I think the most surprising part for me was just how much they enjoy their job most of the time,' she said and added that Julie was often 'pumped and psyched' before a show.

She said she expected to the fattograms to have faced stronger criticism during their career, but learnt this was not the case.

'I was pleasantry surprised at how well they (the shows) tend to go,' she said.

Ms Francis said Julie also smashed all sterotypes associated with traditional strippers.

'She's not conventionally beautiful, she a much bigger woman, she couldn't be more different from a sexy stripper,' she said.

The presenter added that Julie did have lots of energy and lots of sexual energy and said there could be a sexual and/or funny elements to her shows.

'Bigger ladies can still be just as sexual as any others,' she said.

As part of the program Ms Francis also interviewed a dwarf stripper, who said said also enjoyed the work.
