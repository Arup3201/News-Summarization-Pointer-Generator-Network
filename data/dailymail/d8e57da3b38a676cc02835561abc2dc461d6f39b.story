Leighton Baines could return to Premier League action next weekend after the hamstring injury that forced him to withdraw from England's squad was found to be less serious than first feared.

The Everton defender will not play any part in England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on Saturday or next week's international friendly against Scotland after picking up the injury during training on Friday.

However, the Toffees have confirmed that the 29-year-old is expected to be back against West Ham on Saturday 22 November.

A statement of the Everton official website said: 'Leighton Baines could be in contention to face West Ham United next weekend after scans revealed the full-back's hamstring injury is not as serious as first feared.

'He returned to Finch Farm for an assessment which has since showed that he has sustained a 'grade one' hamstring injury – the least significant on the scale of such injuries.

'Baines will continue to be monitored by Everton's medical team and, although he remains a doubt for next Saturday, he has not yet been ruled out of the game against Sam Allardyce's Hammers.'

Arsenal full-back Kieran Gibbs will replace Baines for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia

Arsenal left-back Kieran Gibbs is the only option to replace Baines as manager Roy Hodgson did not name Manchester United's Luke Shaw in his squad listed with UEFA by the deadline on Friday.

Hodgson said: 'Kieran Gibbs is the one to come in as unfortunately we had given our squad at 11 o'clock as we are duty-bound to do to UEFA and, because there were three left backs, I left him [Shaw] out of the 23 as we had 24 players at the time. As it turns out now we can't use him.'

The England manager conceded that he was aware of the rule, but had hoped UEFA would show some leniency by allowing him to call up Shaw as Baines' injury occurred within half an hour of the squad list being submitted.

Hodgson had hoped that UEFA would show some flexibility by allowing him to call up Shaw

He said: 'I can't pretend that I think it's a great idea that you have to name 23 players almost 36 hours before the game because training injuries do occur and people do get injuries and fall sick.

'I would like to think that if you are allowed to have 23 players in your squad that you should at least have the right [to] a little bit longer than 36 hours ahead of the game.

'Having said that, I did know about the rule. My hope was that because we were only 25 minutes late when we applied to bring Luke back into the squad that maybe UEFA would look at that and say, 'It's a reasonable request and we can show some flexibility,' but they decided that wasn't possible, that the rule is the rule, and that 11 o'clock is the deadline and because the injury occurred 25 minutes past 11 we missed it.'
