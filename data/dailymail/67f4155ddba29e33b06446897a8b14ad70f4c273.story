Hart's free kick was required to leave the box before the ball could be considered back in play - so by touching it for a second time, he prevented the ball from becoming live. 

Charlie Austin could have had a first half hat-trick against the Premier League champions on Saturday evening, as he saw two goals disallowed before finally scoring a legitimate goal.

Austin powered home a header from a Mauricio Isla cross, only to see the flag go up to deny him a fourth Premier League goal in three games.

It looked offside at first glance, and replays confirmed that the striker was several yards beyond the last defender.

Mike Dean was at the centre of a major controversy, but the referee got his decision spot on

Charlie Austin heads past Joe Hart, but the flag was rightly up with Austin several yards offside

Austin was celebrating again just moments later, but the officials again ruled the goal out

Free kick inside the penalty area:

Direct or indirect free kick to the defending team: 

• the ball is in play when it is kicked directly out of the penalty area

If, when a free kick is taken by the defending team from inside its own penalty area, the ball is not kicked directly out of the penalty area:

• the kick is retaken

Seconds later, from the resulting free kick, Jo Hart appeared to kick the ball straight to Austin, who smashed it emphatically past the England No 1 and began to celebrate.

Again, his joy was cut short, this time by referee Mike Dean, as confusion spread around Loftus Road.

Again, the officials had got it right. Hart had inadvertently played the ball twice, touching it with his standing foot before scuffing it to Austin. 

While playing the ball twice from a free kick anywhere else on the pitch would result in an indirect free kick to the opposing side, inside the penalty area things are a bit different.

Joe Hart had inadvertantly touched the ball with his standing foot before connecting with it

Hart then scuffed his kick, but the ball had not come into play before being played twice by the keeper

The ball broke to Austin on the edge of the penalty area, but Mike Dean had already blown his whistle

Austin powered home his second disallowed goal in a minute, but the free kick had to be retaken

Dean correctly spotted this, and made him take the free kick again, to QPR's obvious frustration - but correct under the laws of the game.

Austin did eventually get on the score-sheet though, finishing nicely in the 21st minute to put QPR 1-0 up.
