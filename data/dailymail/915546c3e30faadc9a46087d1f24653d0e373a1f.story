These are the amazing scenes when drag racer Kelly Harvey crashes his vintage 1955 Chevy during a drag race, rolling the car several times. 

Harvey was racing a 1970s Camaro at the Pikes Peak International Raceway in Fountain, Colorado, when he lost control of his car, flipping several times. 

Race was ripped from the seat by the force of the crash and was thrown feet-first out through the windshield.

Mr Harvey said he had only fitted a lap belt to his 1955 Chevy which he brought to the race track 

As the two cars raced down the track, the Camaro approached the centre line forcing Harvey to react 

Amazingly, seconds after the car came to rest, Harvey clambered back into his car and to the surprise of the onlooking crowd, Harvey clambered out of the passenger side door. 

The dramatic smash was captured on video and shows how the Chevy was slightly behind the Camaro which started weaving in its lane. 

The Camaro approached the centre line forcing Harvey to react, who lost control of his own car sending it spinning. 

When the car comes to a rest, steam is pouring from its engine bay and Harvey can be seen laying face down with his legs through the car's windshield. 

He told 7NEWS: 'Once (the car) started tumbling, it seemed like it took forever

'I just couldn't wait for it to stop. And I think that's why I popped out of the car so fast. I just wanted it to be over.'

The father-of-four said he has drag raced possibly one thousand times but never had an accident such as this. 

Harvey tried to pull full opposite lock in a desperate attempt to keep it under control

The car rolled over several times, with bits of bodywork and the car's hood flying off 

He said he had recently fitted a lap belt to the 1955 car, which did not have a racing seat or a full racing harness. 

Harvey admitted he overcorrected when powering down the straight and even clipped the other car. 

He said: 'It's just a fun cruiser car, not a race car and therefore it was unprepared. I didn't take it as seriously as I should have as far as safety equipment goes.'

He said he must have had an 'angel riding shotgun.' 

When the car comes to a rest, shocked onlookers can see Harvey's legs sticking out across the hood

Spectators can barely believe it as the driver's door of the car opens before emergency services arrive

He added: 'Sunday morning when I saw the video, it really started to kind of hit home a lot more. When I saw the severity of it and how lucky I really was to have gotten out of that alive -- let alone pretty much unhurt.'

Despite the major crash Harvey, who drives a tow truck for a living, said he looks forward to going back on the race track. 

In a statement released by the Colorado Street Outlaws Drag Racing Event, Harvey said: 'My seat belts were not mounted properly and pulled through the floor of the car. 

'I'm grateful to the staff and safety crew at PPIR for such a rapid response to my situation.'

Race track general manager Bob Boileau said: 'PPIR sets standards for all its events to keep drivers, crew, and spectators safe However, it is the responsibility of the car owner, driver and crews to be sure their vehicles are prepared to take to the track. We're glad there were no serious injuries.'
