One of the Queen’s prize racehorses has tested positive for a banned drug, it was revealed last night.

Estimate, a five-year-old filly, failed the test when the painkiller morphine was found in a sample taken after a race, Buckingham Palace said.

Trained by leading flat racing trainer Sir Michael Stoute, Estimate won the Ascot Gold Cup last year - the first royal horse to win the prestigious race.

Estimate owned by the Queen has tested positive for morphine, a prohibited substance, Buckingham Palace announced

She came second in this year’s Gold Cup last month, when the test is believed to have occurred.

The revelation came five days after the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) announced that at least five horses, from various trainers, had tested positive for banned drugs following race meetings.

It has begun an investigation. Morphine is a permitted medication for racehorses but is banned on race days.

Initial 
indications are that Estimate’s positive test was caused by her eating 
contaminated feed, the Palace said. The Queen has been informed.

Following
 the BHA’s announcement, Northamptonshire-based feed manufacturer Dodson
 and Horrell, which has held a royal warrant since 1985, said its 
suppliers had informed the company of possible contamination and it 
destroyed all of its stock of a feed called Alfalfa Oil Plus.

Last night John Warren, the Queen’s bloodstock and racing adviser, said: ‘Sir Michael is working closely with the feed company involved to discover how the product may have become contaminated prior to delivery to his stables.

‘As the 
BHA investigates this matter, including potential links between the 
different cases, Sir Michael continues to offer his full co-operation.’

Once
 investigations are complete, the cases will be put before a BHA 
disciplinary panel which will decide if any should be taken.

This could include disqualifying the horses involved from the races they had competed in.

Initial indications are that the positive test resulted from the consumption of a contaminated feed product, the palace said

If Estimate did test positive after this year’s Gold Cup, the horse could be stripped of her second place and the Queen would forfeit the £80,625 prize.

When Estimate won last year’s Gold Cup, the Queen cheered her to victory and then joined jockey Ryan Moore and trainer Sir Michael for the presentation – which had to be hastily rearranged as she had been due to hand over the trophy.

The Duke of York stepped in to make the presentation to his mother, who also won £155,960 in prize money.
