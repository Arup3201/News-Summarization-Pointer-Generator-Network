A new GCSE supergrade is to be awarded to the brightest teenagers after the current elite A* grade was devalued by being awarded to too many students.

It is expected just one in 35 students who show ‘exceptional’ performance will be awarded the top ‘grade nine’ in GCSE - effectively an A**.

The change for GCSE English and maths in 2017 - and other subjects from 2018 - is designed to help universities and employers spot the most gifted students.

But it is also an indictment of the current system which has seen the proportion of A* grades creep up from 2.9 per cent when it was first introduced in 1994 to 7.8 per cent in 2011.

The number of A* grades has since dipped to 6.7 per cent but fewer than 3 per cent of entrants are expected to get the new A** style grade nine.

The changes were outlined yesterday by exams watchdog Ofqual after former Education Secretary Michael Gove ordered sweeping improvements to GCSEs beginning in 2015.

Under the new system, traditional alphabetic grades – A* to G – will be axed in favour of numbers from one to nine, with nine being the highest.

The top two grades on the current scale – A and A* - will be replaced with three in the new system – seven, eight and nine.

Just 20 per cent of pupils in line for at least an A under the current system will achieve the elite grade nine.

In English, it could mean just 2.8 per cent of candidates gaining the top grade and in maths, 2.9 per cent.

This is similar to the proportion who gained an A* when that grade was introduced in 1994 to identify higher and lower performers within the A-grade band.  

In a further reform, grades will be benchmarked for the first time against top-performing countries such as China and Finland.

Glenys Stacey, head of Ofqual, said the so-called ’20 per cent rule’ was the ‘fairest’ way to ‘achieve that greater stretch and differentiation at the top end so many require’.  

Explaining the changes, Mrs Stacey said: ‘Similar numbers of students who got A* or A in the old qualifications will get either seven, eight or nine in the new qualifications.

‘That means we’ve got three grades – seven, eight and nine – whereas we only have A and A* at the moment, so two grades will become three.

'You’ll bear in mind there’s been a strong call from users of GCSEs that there needs to be greater differentiation at the top end.’

It also emerged that the same proportion of students will achieve at least a grade four under the new system as receive at least a grade C currently.

Grade four is likely to be seen as a de facto ‘pass’ – as C is currently – but Ofqual said grade five was actually the standard of a pass in top-performing nations.  

Officials said that grade five had been pegged to performance in countries and regions such as Singapore, Shanghai, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands.   

Ofqual also released the results of a consultation on the planned changes, which found that a majority supported toughening up the criteria for the top grade.

Several respondents said grade nine ‘should test the most able and be restricted to a small number of exceptional candidates’.

One teacher said: ‘Grade 9 should be for exceptional results, otherwise it will go the same way that A* went after its introduction. How many are exceptional? I’ve no idea but based on an average school cohort sitting my subject’s exam I would expect a grade 9 to be achieved by only 2 or 3 out of an entry of 60+.’

However criticisms of the plan included the claim that state schools would suffer because independent schools would bring more pupils up to the standard required for the new grade.

It would have a ‘disproportionate effect on state schools’, it was claimed.

The 20 per cent rule will apply to revamped GCSEs in English language, English literature and maths which schools will begin to teach in autumn 2015, with the first exams taken in summer 2017.

A similar approach is expected – but not guaranteed - for other GCSE subjects, which are being phased in from 2016.

Changes to GCSEs already confirmed include an end to modular tests in most subjects, with traditional end-of-course exams becoming the ‘default method of assessment’.

The move is aimed at stopping the merry-go-round of pupils entering early or multiple times in the hope of eventually gaining a good grade.

Controversial ‘controlled assessments’ – coursework done in class – will be minimised amid concerns over teachers were able to massage results.

The new-look GCSEs will also feature more demanding subject content and a better mix of closed and open-ended questions.

In a further move, a sample of pupils each year – possibly several thousand – would sit an English and maths test just before their GCSEs to help examiners ensure that grading is accurate.

If pupils do well in the tests, being introduced in 2017, it may mean that higher grades are awarded in GCSEs. Ofqual would be able to claim grades had risen legitimately – rather than because of grade inflation - because candidates had achieved higher standards in their subjects.

If pupils fail to improve on the previous year, Ofqual will use the results as justification for keeping grades down.

Head teachers’ leaders were already voicing concerns last night over the plan to limit the proportion of pupils gaining the grade nine to 20 per cent of A-grade performers.   

Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘We do have concerns about limiting the proportion of students who can get the highest grade. If students achieve at a very high level that should be recognised. Where standards have improved, the results must reflect this.’
