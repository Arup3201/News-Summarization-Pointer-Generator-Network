Some people may think that grammar doesn't matter anymore, but there is clearly a quiet army out there of those who disagree.

In the wake of a council's decision to remove apostrophes from street signs, an anonymous guerrilla grammarian is going around using a marker pen to correct the punctuation.

Signs with missing punctuation, such as that at Scholars Walk, have seen the correct apostrophe inserted overnight.

On the same sign in the town's East Chesterton area, an apostrophe has also been added to Pepys Court.

The local authority in Cambridge has 
been accused of 'dumbing down' in the great university town over its 
decision to remove punctuation from street signs.

Kathy Salaman, director of the Cambridge-based Good Grammar Company, praised the covert operation - although denied being the person responsible.

She said: 'I am very pleased that someone or some people have taken it in their hands to correct this dumbing down.

'It is further proof of how much people have been affected by this idea of getting rid of something as important as our grammar.

'Cambridge is famous for the university and for people coming from other countries, such as scholars or business people, the signs without correct punctuation would give a very bad impression.

'I have heard that the signs have been vandalised by the marker pen but to me it was the language that has been vandalised by removing the apostrophes.'

The council argues it is simply following guidelines from the National Land and Property Gazetteer, where all new street names are registered.

They argue that apostrophes are said to lead to mistakes â€“ particularly among emergency services.

Councillor Tim Ward, executive director of planning, said: 'I think people would be more unhappy if an ambulance was unable to find their street.'

Cllr Ward admitted that the decision could be reversed the 'next time we refresh our policy' if national guidelines change.

But he added that the punctuation of street signs was currently a low priority issue for the local authority following a raft of budget cuts.

The Cambridge News has reported that Cambridgeshire's police and fire services, as well as the East of England Ambulance Service, have no objections to punctuations in road names but Cllr Ward said the local authority would adjust its policy according to national guidelines.

The naming policy also bans street names which would be 'difficult to pronounce or awkward to spell' and any which 'could give offence' or would 'encourage defacing of nameplates'.

Existing street names are not affected by the policy.
