Decorated: Nick Irving was nicknamed 'The Reaper' by his fellow soldiers for his skill as a sniper 

A sniper has told how he was given the nickname 'The Reaper' by his comrades in the military - after killing 33 men in less than four months.

Former Army Ranger Nick ‘Irv’ Irving using his trusty SR-25 rifle he nicknamed ‘Dirty Diana’ to blast insurgents to death during the Iraq War.

He was so possessive over ‘his girl’ as he called the gun, that he hated it when other men touched her and would spend four hours a night painting her.

Before every battle he would get pumped up to the sounds of men zipping their gear up with Velcro, which he likened to music being played to a high school football team.

Irving was trained to become a sniper by his superiors who told him that it was the biggest thrill of your life and that 'once you kill a man, you can’t replace that feeling.'

He has told of his career in a book published just weeks after the release of ‘American Sniper’, the film about the life of Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in American history.

The movie, which stars Bradley Cooper as Kyle, tells how Kyle shot dead 255 enemies before being killed by a fellow Army veteran suffering from PTSD.

In Irving’s memoir, extracts of which were published in the New York Post, he tells how he became the first black sniper in the Army’s Third Ranger Battalion, which had previously fought in the ‘Black Hawk Down’ incident in Somalia.

He was the son of two enlisted soldiers in Fort Meade, Maryland, but didn’t want to be in the Army until he got curious about weapons as a teenager.

He built himself a blowgun and eventually signed up, serving tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.

During his training his platoon sergeant told him: ‘After you kill a man, there’s no other feeling like it. Mark my words.

Skilled shooter: Irving killed 33 insurgents in lass than four months during the Iraq War. He now runs a training site in San Antonio, Texas

‘You won’t want to do any hunting again. The excitement of that will be gone. You won’t find any joy in it. Once you kill a man, you can’t replace that feeling.’

Memories: Irving released his memoir (book cover above) about his sniper days just a few weeks after the debut of film American Sniper, which follows the life of Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history

Irving’s first kill came outside of Ramallah when he was on the .50 caliber machine gun in a convoy of Stryker armored vehicles.

A car drove past them, stopped and drove towards them at speed. Irving’s supervisor said: ‘Take him out’.

Irving writes that he fired seven rounds and said: ‘I saw something explode inside the car. It wasn’t an IED, it was the man inside it. He turned into mist and chunks.’

His comrades shouted ‘Yeah!’ and ‘Get Some’.

Irving was stunned that it could be that easy but writes that he was haunted what he had done that later that night the man he shot ‘returned to me’ in a nightmare.

He writes: ‘I had a dream where I was in a room with a ceiling fan spinning above me.

‘The blades of the fan were the man’s four limbs plus his head and chest. He was staring at me with that same dead-eyed stare, but as the fan spun faster and faster, he started screaming at me open-mouthed.

‘Eventually the fan got spinning so fast that his limbs were whipped off and he sprayed the room with blood and guts, covering me as well with gelatinous goo.’

According to Irving, the tiniest thing can scupper a sniper’s shot including having the wrong ladder.

He had a telescoping ladder and recounts how on one occasion he had to put it near vertical to get him high enough to see the target from the top.

After shooting the man dead - he turned out to be a suicide bomber - his supervisor told him:

The first: Irving became the first black sniper of the Army's Third Ranger Battalion. The battalion previously fought in the Battle of Mogadishu, also known as Black Hawk Down

‘The hollow point expanded and pushed everything up and out of his chest.

‘His heart was hanging there on the outside of his body cavity, still pumping a couple of times, spraying the tree and leaves.’

Irving is his most poetic when talking about what it’s like to actually pull the trigger.

He writes: ‘I squeezed the trigger and experienced that slow-motion effect.

‘The smell of the gas burning out of the suppressor mixed with the sweet smell of the gun oil I use. My eye still focused on the crosshairs in the center of the scope, I watched as the man collapsed, almost as if he were a balloon being popped.’

And speaking about his love of Velcro, he said: ‘I don’t know what the military did before it was invented. Hearing 35 or so guys strapping stuff on with that simple hook and loop mechanism, the sound of tape being unrolled as guys secure things to keep as silent as possible, was like the music we’d play in the locker room (in high school) before a game to get pumped up. That collective sound signaled that we all had each other’s back.’

Nightmares: Irving says he now sleeps with a pistol under his pillow or on the nightstand next to his wife Jessica

Irving, who now runs a training site in San Antonio and blogs on special forces website sofrep.com, said that he was not the same after the war and once stole a bottle of gatorade from a supermarket without realizing.

He also still sleeps with a pistol under his pillow or on a nightstand next to his wife, Jessica.

Irving’s life mirrors that of Kyle who before his death in 2013 notched up his record number of kills during the Iraq war.

He became so feared by insurgents they put a $80,000 bounty on his head and nicknamed him al-Shaitan Ramad, or ‘the Devil of Ramadi’.

In one battle alone he shot dead 40 enemy soldiers although his greatest achievement was his longest kill - from a staggering 1.2 miles away.

Kyle told of his incredible career in his memoir called ‘American Sniper’ which became a bestseller and became the basis for the film of his life, which premiered posthumously.
