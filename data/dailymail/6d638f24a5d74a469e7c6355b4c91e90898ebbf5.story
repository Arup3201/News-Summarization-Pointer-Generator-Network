Paranormal investigators say they have proof that a U.S Navy aircraft carrier is haunted.

The Californian ghostbusters, who call themselves the 'Chill Seekers', recorded a 12-minute video of their investigation last month aboard the USS Hornet, birthed in Alameda, California.

The video appears to show spirit voices communicating with them and at one point telling them 'We are under attack' and to 'Get off the ship'.

Hair designer Ashley, the Chill Seeker's researcher and investigator, introduces the 12-minute clip from outside the USS Hornet in Alameda. The clip goes on to offer 'proof' of the group's paranormal findings

The ship's decks are explored by flashlight as the group retells ghost stories and puts questions to the spirits who are said to reside aboard the vessel on which 300 people died over the years

The group spends a large portion of the film sat in the ship's briefing room where they announce to any listening spirits: 'We are not here to disrespect anyone or anything on this ship'

CV-12 Combat Score (War in the Pacific)

1,420 aircraft destroyed

42 cargo ships sunk

10 destroyers sunk

1 cruiser sunk

1 carrier sunk

1 assist on super battle ship YAMATO

In one scene they say that an audible tapping sound is Morse Code, translated to read 'Hi, I.T', which they suggest is a message from the I.T technicians who used to work aboard the ship on which more than 300 people died.

The group from Modesto visited the ship last month on its 70th anniversary last month and toured it in darkness, with the aid of torches.

The ship, no longer in service, saw action in World war Two and the Apollo 11 manned space mission.

Introducing the investigation, researcher Ashley said the USS Hornet 'is responsible for destroying 1,400 enemy planes, sinking one million tonnes of enemy ships and more suicides onboard than any other ship in the Navy.'

Equipped with digital recording equipment, static cameras and their 'spirit box,' which scans through radio frequencies, the group of four 20-somethings patrol the ship's decks in darkness, relaying ghost stories and stopping to ask questions to 'the spirits'.

Carissa, the lead investigator can be heard asking the question: 'Are you happy to see women aboard?

'To which comes the faint reply picked up on the camera's microphone: 'It's good.'

The ship's museum looks decidedly spooky in the video clip

A tapping sound that can be heard in the film is said by the group to be attempts by spirit Morse Code workers who used to work onboard, to make contact. The tapping sound is translated and said to read: 'Hi I.T

Keith, the group's audio/visual specialist and keen Hip Hop musician seen here with his voice recorder, asks the spirits: Who am I? A voice can be heard responding: 'You are Keith'. Just as well someone is on the ball!

Andrew, a chef by trade, works as the group's technician, and can be seen here listening and looking out for paranormal activity onboard the ship

A static camera is placed on the steps seen here. The group is convinced that the camera's microphone picks up the sound of movement, despite nothing appearing to pass up or down

The same voice can be heard saying the words: 'U.S. Navy', in response to Carissa asking what the name of the ship is, before appearing to say the words 'comfortable' and 'Gordon.'

Later she can be seen sitting down, 
convinced she has been touched by a spirit. She says she feels 'cold and
 tingly' and asks: 'Are you touching me right now'.

Although physical contact is not confirmed, the camera's microphone appears to pick up the response: 'Get out.'

Keith looks surprised when he hears his name in response to his question: Who am I? It's a pity the ChillSeekers are not as hot on English as they are on the heels of ghosts. 'Your' should read 'You're'

Carissa was convinced she'd been touched by a spirit in the film. She said she felt 'tingly and cold'

As well as being 'touched', she also appears to be given her marching orders as a voice can be heard saying 'Get Out' despite her invitation to the spirits to come out and tell them their stories

When Keith, the group's audio visual specialist and part-time Hip Hop artist asks 'who am I?'Â  A voice can be heard responding: 'You are Keith.'

Keith also places a a static camera on the ship's stairs and is convinced it recorded the sound of movement.

The group believes spirits communicate using white noise and by manipulating transmissions and investigate paranormal activities in various locations following tip offs from members of the public.

Their catchline is: 'If you don't believe it, join us on our hunts, see things you've never seen before'.

Meet the team: Carissa and Ashley are the two female investigators as ChillSeekers

Andrew and Keith complete the fearless foursome. As a group they invite the public to tip them off about suspected ghost haunts so that they can turn up and investigate
