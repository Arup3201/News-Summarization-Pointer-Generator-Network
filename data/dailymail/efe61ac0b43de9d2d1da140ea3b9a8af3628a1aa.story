Tragic: Shana Dowdeswell, 23, died after downing several shots in a New City York bar

The mother of a Broadway actress who died after a late-night whiskey binge has slammed the bar that served her for not calling time on her drinking before she overdosed on alcohol.

Shana Dowdeswell, 23 - who has acted onstage with Cynthia Nixon and
appears in the new Robert De Niro movie 'The Big Wedding' - died five days after downing several shots in a New York bar called The Basement last December.

Now her mother, Laurie Smith, 60, has blamed the bar for it's part in her daughter's death, claiming she confronted staff about why they served her when she was clearly too drunk.

But barstaff told her they had served the actress four shots of whiskey and that she was drinking water in the early morning of Dec. 7, the New York Post reported.

She said The Basement was a regular haunt for Shana, adding: 'At first, I hated The Basement. That was a well-known gathering 
place for people who wanted to drink a lot for a little bit of money. 
There’s just something going wrong down there.'

Now she is calling for police to clamp down on pubs that serve alcohol to punters who have already drunk too much and wants to launch a campaign group to warn mothers about the perils of binge drinking.

'The same way there’s Mothers Against Drunk Driving, there has to be a
Mothers Against Overdrinking. Wake up kids - it has grotesque 
outcomes.' she warned.

She said her daughter - who has acted on screen and stage since the age of eight - entered the bar at around midnight and began ordering whiskeys.

She then stumbled home two and a half hours later but only got as far as her parents' doorstep where she passed out.

A dog walker discovered the girl and she was rushed to Beth Israel Medical Center.

She died five days later of acute and chronic alcoholism.

'Things going wrong': Shana was a regular at The Basement bar in New York's Greenwich Village

The girl, who was 5-foot-2 and weighted 115 lbs, registered a blood alcohol content of 0.39 at the time she was found, which is five times the state's legal limit for 
driving.

Basement manager Ronnie Mejia denied that Shana was served too much, telling the Post she never appeared drunk and 'never got more than three drinks'.

The Medical Examiner’s Office ruled that Shana died of 'natural causes due to complications of acute and chronic alcoholism.'

The girl's mother did tell DNA Info that her daughter began visiting neighborhood when she was just a teen.

'She probably had issues around alcohol that we weren't aware of,' she said.

Shana was born in her father's native Zimbabwe but moved to New York City for elementary school, according to her obituary.

She attended the City and Country School in Manhattan's Greenwich village, a progressive independent school.

With her keen interest in acting, she enrolled in the Professional Performing Arts School for high school, to pursue her first love.

Her roles included playing Anne Frank at the Papermill Playhouse and cameos on TV shows like Law & Order, Body of Proof and Mercy.

She was managed by her mother, Laurie Smith, who runs the Smith Talent Group.

Her father, Roger Dowdeswell, is a former professional tennis player who is now the tennis director at the Manhattan Plaza Racquet Club.

She is also survived by her brother, Jesse.

'Shana was a bright spirit, a shining, generous, hopeful girl...We miss her profoundly, and will continue to all of our days,' her family said in her obituary.
