The family of the Michael Brown, the African-American teenager shot dead by a cop in St Louis will carry out their own autopsy when they get his body, MailOnline can reveal.

Relatives of Michael Brown said that they 'do not trust the authorities in our community' and wanted a second opinion on how he died.

They also questioned whether or not the officer who shot Michael dead called in the incident - and claimed that he initially walked away from the scene.

The move 
is a damning indictment of the complete breakdown in relations between 
Michael's family and the almost all white police force in Ferguson, a 
suburb of St Louis, Missouri.

Michael
 died at the age of 18 when he was repeatedly shot by a cop as he walked
 to his grandmother’s house unarmed and in broad daylight on Saturday.

Trust: Michael's mother Lesley McSpadden with husband, Louis Head, during a rally at the St. Mark Family Church on Tuesday night. They will ask for a second autopsy once the police hand back the body

Transparency: Police have said the results of their preliminary autopsy show that Michael was shot multiple times - but did not reveal how many and where on his body

Demand: Eric Davis, (pictured with wife Cheryl) told MailOnline: 'We want our own answers. Michael came from a loving family and the depiction of him and everything that the police are trying to put on him is totally not true'

The suburb suffered a third night of unrest following the killing on Tuesday as police in riot gear and armored trucks trained high-powered rifles on protestors after a rally led by Al Sharpton, who had arrived in the city to support the family.

It also emerged that a police officer critically injured a masked man who was believed to be staging a robbery.

The preliminary results of the official autopsy show Michael died as a result of gunshot wounds, according to the St Louis County Medical Examiner's office.

The results did not disclose how many times Michael was hit and that will only be made public when the full report is released in four weeks.

In an interview with MailOnline, Michael’s cousin Eric Davis said: 'We don’t have Michael’s body back yet. The police still have it but when we get it back we will arrange our own autopsy.

'We don’t trust the authorities in our community. We want our own answers. Michael came from a loving family and the depiction of him and everything that the police are trying to put on him is totally not true.

'For them to do this and not be transparent and not even give us the officer’s name.'

He added: 
'We don't even know what his (the cop's) state of mind was. He could 
have been on drugs but we don't know because it's been too long to find 
out.'

Michael’s
 family, who are being represented by Benjamin Crump, the attorney for 
Trayvon Martin's family, claim the case has been mishandled right from 
the start when his dead body was left uncovered for five hours on the 
street.

Onlookers had posted pictures of his bloody corpse on Facebook and Instagram before it was finally covered up.

Mr
 Davis even claimed: 'Witnesses told us that the officer walked away 
from the scene and then he came back and got in his car and drove off. Did he radio it in? Michael's body was left uncovered for five hours.'

The most compelling witness to come forward so far has been Dorian Johnson, 22, who was with Michael on Saturday as he got shot.

He has said that the cop told them to 'get the f***' on to the sidewalk' while they were walking along the road. The officer pulled his truck in front of them and blocked the road, Johnson told MSNBC.

The cop then threw open the door which slammed closed again after bouncing off Michael. It was then that the officer grabbed Michael by the neck and an altercation ensued.

Johnson claimed that Michael ran off and stopped, holding his hands up in surrender - but the cop shot him anyway.

Mr Davis said: 'Michael’s flip flops were at one point on the street, his hat was 10ft further on, and 10ft past that was his body. You can clearly see he was making point of moving away from the officer.'

Pastor Charles Ewing, Michael's uncle, also told MailOnline that people in the neighborhood were accustomed to walking on the road as the sidewalk was narrow, so when the officer saw them doing so it should have been nothing unusual.

Ferguson is now at a tense standoff with the community demanding that the name of the officer be released.

In an interview with CBS his mother Lesley McSpadden said that he should do the decent thing and come forward.

She said: 'If he did something wrong, you know you did something wrong.

'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'
