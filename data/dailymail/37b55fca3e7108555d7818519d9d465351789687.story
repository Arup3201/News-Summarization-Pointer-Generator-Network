Philadelphia Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard scored a run over the weekend without touching home plate – a first in the more than 150 years of Major League Baseball.

Howard was called safe even after being tagged out by the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Miguel Montero because the catcher illegally blocked home plate in violation of a new rule adopted prior to this season.

The rule and instant replay review, also introduced prior to the 2014 season, confirmed Howard was not provided a clear path to the plate. Umpires ruled him safe and awarded the run.

Howard began the sixth inning play standing at first base while teammate Marlon Byrd batted with two outs.

Byrd popped a fly ball to shallow right field that looked to be a routine out until Arizona second baseman Didi Gregorious botched the play and watched helplessly as the ball deflected off his glove towards center field.

At the same time, Howard was charging around third base and heading home – players are taught from a very young age to run out fly balls with two outs because either the inning ends with a third out or a freak play like Gregorious’ error can happen.

Arizona center fielder Ender Inciarte scooped up the errant ball and fired home to try to throw Howard out.

Safe: The home plate umpire awarded Howard the run after a replay review confirmed Montero blocked the plate

Montero clearly caught the ball before Howard reached home plate, but he blocked Howard’s path to the plate before he had the ball – in violation of the new rule.

‘The catcher may not block the pathway of a runner attempting to score unless he has possession of the ball. If the catcher blocks the runner before he has the ball, the umpire may call the runner safe,’ an explanation of the rule on MLB’s website says.

The rule was adopted prioro to this season after star San Francisco Giants catcher buster Posey suffered a severe concussion last season on a similar play where he blocked the plate but was run over by the base runner.

Howard tried to elude Montero but was tagged out. He immediately threw his arms in the air in disgust, and Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg trotted out to call for a replay review.

Montero was found by replay technicians in New York to have broken the rule, Howard was called safe and the run was awarded to give Philadelphia a 3-2 lead.

The Phillies eventually beat the Diamondbacks 4-2.
