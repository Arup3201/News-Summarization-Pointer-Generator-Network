Tesco is expected to post its worst results in 20 years on Wednesday as shoppers continue to desert the chain for budget rivals.

It is thought that Britain’s biggest grocer will reveal sales fell more than 4 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 – far worse than the 2.9 per cent drop in the previous three months.

Despite spending £200million on cutting the price of basic items, analysts say Tesco is still perceived as ‘too expensive’ compared to the likes of Aldi and Lidl.

Tesco’s woes have stunned the industry with one expert saying such a poor performance would have been ‘almost unfathomable in times past’.

Clive Back, an analyst at stockbrokers Shore Capital, said he had ‘never been so gloomy about Tesco’s prospects in 20 years’.

He said: ‘We believe Tesco UK is increasingly perceived by customers as simply too expensive versus the discounters, Asda and potentially Morrisons. That is a dangerous and frankly untenable place for a mass-market leader to be.’

The grim figures, due on Wednesday, will pile further pressure on chief executive Phil Clarke, who has struggled since he took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011.

Analysts at JP Morgan said the figures will be ‘the worst published by the company we can recall in 15 to 20 years’.

‘If our forecast proves accurate, it will cast doubt on any suggestion by management that the strategy is working and that the company is in better shape than it was two or three years ago,’ said JP Morgan’s Jaime Vazquez.

Tesco shocked the stock market with its first profits warning in a generation in 2012 but it is feared that more will follow unless it halts the collapse in sales.

Profits at the once-mighty chain slumped 6.9 per cent last year after a 1.3 per cent slide in sales in the UK.

Mr Clarke who has been struggling to come up with initiatives to boost market share and kick start growth since taking over the supermarket chain.

As well as cutting prices, Tesco has recruited more staff and spruced up its stores in a bid to revive its fortunes.

The Big Four supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have all suffered at the hands of the discounters as well as premium range rivals Waitrose and Whole Foods.

The popularity of Aldi and Lidl has increased significantly since the start of the recession with the stigma felt by some at being seen in one of their stores wearing off.

Industry experts say that shopping habits have changed, with the weekly shop giving way to more frequent smaller trips as families hunt out the best deals and reduce waste.
