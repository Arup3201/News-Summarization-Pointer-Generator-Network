Ricardo Carvalho believes Real Madrid would have the most feared attack in football if Falcao were to join Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale to the Spanish capital next season.

The Colombia striker, a firm favourite of Real president Florentino Perez, was a talismanic figure at cross-city rivals Atletico prior to his move to Monaco last summer.

Reports in Spain suggest that the forward, who is currently watching his country star in the World Cup from the sidelines as he recovers from a cruciate ligament injury, is in negotiations with a move to boss Carlo Ancelotti's side.

Missing piece: Ricardo Carvalho says Real Madrid would have the most feared attack in football if Falcao joins

Speaking to Madrid-based paper AS, former Real defender Carvalho thinks the addition of the 28-year-old is the missing piece to making the Champions League winners an irresistible force next season.

The pair are currently team-mates at Monaco with Falcao's professionalism impressing the 36-year-old last campaign.

'Everyone knows Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world and also the best professional,' Carvalho said.

'In terms of professionalism, Falcao is the player who is closest. He will have a very long career because he takes so much care.

'Cristiano, Gareth Bale and Falcao would be the most feared three-man attack in football history. But it’s better [for Monaco] that Falcao stays.

'I think Falcao is the missing piece to make the Madrid attack perfect. Cristiano is the best player in the world, Bale is very good and Falcao is the best striker there is. I’m a defender and I wouldn’t want to face them!'
