All
hail Movember, the month of the moustache, when men grow their finest 
handlebar to raise awareness of prostate
cancer. 

And it's good news for those charitable hairies, because the latest survey has revealed that a Movember moustache could make you more attractive to the opposite sex.

According to a new study, over a fifth of women said they would be more likely to date a guy growing a 'tache this month, with 55 per cent saying raising money for charity makes a potential date more attractive.

Get growing: 80 per cent of women think a Movember moustache makes a man seem more attractive - and it's Johnny Depp (L) and James Franco (R) whose 'taches they love

80 per cent of respondents said a moustache can make a guy look 'fun', 'generous', 'rugged' and 'outdoorsy'.

But who exactly should the 'tache growing man channel?

The study asked women about their favourite moustachioed celebrities and was inundated with responses from fans of the rugged look.

The top celebrity lip fizz included Johnny Depp, James Franco, George Clooney and Freddie Mercury...  as well as Ned Flanders from the Simpsons.

Tashing on: Women think the facial hair makes men look fun, generous, rugged and outdoorsy - and voted George Clooney and Freddy Mercury as having good stubble

Movember is an annual charity campaign which asks men to grow a moustache throughout the month of November to raise money and awareness about men's health.

It specifically funds programmes for testicular and prostate cancer. Movember launched in Australia in 2003, and last year raised £92million with 1.1million Mo Bros taking part from around the world. Television personality and founder of MySingleFriend, Sarah Beeny, who carried out the survey, said: 'Movember is one of my favourite charity events.

'I encourage men to get involved every year and I'd definitely say growing a Mo makes a guy more attractive to women. It shows that he is kind-hearted, has a sense of humour and doesn't take himself too seriously.

'Joining the Movember army supports such a fantastic cause, and could also get you a date at the same time! Any woman that says she isn't curious about being kissed by a hairy-lipped lothario has to be lying.'

  Gillette's man of Style and Men's Health Style Director Dan Rookwood shares his top m's this Movember: 

Take your pick! Here are our top tips on how to achieve your perfect mo of choice

The Crossbar - The great thing about this style is you can leave it for a few days and you'll still maintain a great moustache shape. However, if you wanted to achieve a more defined look, use a moulding cream to smooth the hair down from the top of the hair to the bottom, working the cream in the same direction as the hair growth  

The Curler - Get yourself a strong moustache wax with an admirably manly scent to ensure your Mo stays in shape. Work the wax into the end of the hair and twist the hair away from your face to create the thin curly shape  

The One Two - You need a good trimmer to achieve the intricacies of this look. Try the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler which comes with a trimmer and edging blade to give you a great looking soul patch    

The Sweeper - Use a moustache comb to make sure you achieve the manly tendrils this look demands. The great thing about this Mo style is you can get away with minimal grooming – the manlier the better  

Pencil Thin - This Mo needs to look downy, think Chris Kamara. Use your trimmer to thin out your Mo to keep the hairs to a light lip dusting. Use your trimmer to achieve an even thin trim – I recommend a grade 3 clipper attachment. It's important to keep the lip clear, the lip should be totally visible and the moustache hair no longer than 0.5cm. This is also the best style for those who can't quite grow enough facial hair for a full on tache

(If you want achieve these looks but can't achieve them yourself, pop down to Gillette's pop-up Barber Shop on 7 Earlham St, Seven Dials, London anytime throughout Movember for a free MO shave.)

 The average man has up to 900 hairs on his MO alone, and between 6,000 and 26,000 on his entire face.

Sleep deficiency has been known to slow down facial hair growth so make sure you get an early night this Movember.

Men's facial hair grows faster than women's underarm or leg hair.

Did you know that dry facial hair has the strength of copper wire of the same thickness? That is one tough MO you are sporting, old chap.

Gillette scientists have calculated that men will spend a total of 32.5 days in their lifetime removing facial hair. If it is any consolation you don't have to shave your top lip for the next 30 days!

During the month of Movember you can expect your MO to grow to up to 9mm-1cm in length. If you multiply that by the 900 hairs in the average moustache you have approximately 9 meters of hair in your MO alone.

On average men spend 20 minutes on their appearance each morning and a total of 780 hours of their life shaving.
