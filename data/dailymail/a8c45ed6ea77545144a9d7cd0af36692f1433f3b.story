A Polish man appeared in court yesterday accused of stealing ‘sensitive and restricted’ documents relating to some of the Royal Navy’s submarines.

The court was told the files went missing when a naval dockyard worker’s Plymouth flat was burgled. 

But the incident only came to light when the Polish embassy was contacted about the documents – which refer to the ‘design and operation of certain submarines’ – by someone demanding a substantial amount of money.

Defendant Marcin Kostrzewa was arrested on Thursday by a Scotland Yard anti-terror team.

The court heard that he had been the subject of an international arrest warrant following a robbery in 2006.

The 31-year-old night foreman, who was accused of trespassing and stealing sensitive material, has pleaded not guilty.

Mike Crumley, defending, claimed his client found the sensitive files in a bin.

Mr Kostrzewa was refused bail by Torbay magistrates.

He is due to appear before a judge at Plymouth Crown Court on April 28.
