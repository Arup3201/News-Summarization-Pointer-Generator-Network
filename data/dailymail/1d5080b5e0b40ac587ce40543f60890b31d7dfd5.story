A teenage boy, his parents and an uncle were killed in Texas when an SUV leading police on a high-speed chase ran a stop sign and crashed into the family's sedan.

Cops in Dickinson, southeast of Houston, say that an officer tried to pull over a Dodge Durango about 8:20pm on Sunday after he spotted the truck swerving.

But the driver — later identified as Juan G. Ahuezoteco, 23 — sped away when the police lights went off.

'He was going so fast my guy couldn't keep up,' Captain Jay Jaekel, of the Dickinson PD, told The Galveston County Daily News.

Cops continued to pursue Ahuezoteco for another 10 minutes while he zoomed through traffic at speeds well in excess of 100mph, cops said.

Ahuezoteco ran a stop sign in nearby League City, striking a Honda Accord.

Killed in the Honda were a married couple — Rafael Guererro, 41, and Alejandra Guererro, 38 — their unidentified 15-year-old son and the woman's brother, GIlberto Ortega Jr., 25.

Ahuezoteco and his passenger, Alejandro Molina, were also killed. The driver was wanted on a felony count of driving while intoxicated.
