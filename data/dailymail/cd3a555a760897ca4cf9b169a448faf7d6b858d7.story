Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning says he has no plans to quit the NFL even if he wins his second Super Bowl on Sunday.

Manning, 37, has so far thrown a record breaking season of 55 touchdown passes and 5,447 yards, and will make history as the only quarterback to win Super Bowl titles with separate teams if the Denver Broncos beat the Seattle Seahawks.

But the quarterback has denied speculation that he might quit while he's ahead, telling a press conference that he still enjoys the game and has no plans for a swift exit.

Peyton Manning, 37, has said he has no plans to retire, even if the Denver Broncos win on Sunday

Speaking to Associated Press, he said: 'I think when you still enjoy the preparation and the work part of it, then you probably still ought to be doing that.

'I think as soon as I stop enjoying it, if I can't produce, if I can't help a team, that's when I'll stop.

'If that's next year, maybe it is, but I certainly want to continue to keep playing.'

Manning previously won the Super Bowl in 2006 with the Indianapolis Colts, but following 14 season with the team he underwent surgery on a herniated disc in his spine, an injury which nearly cost him his career.

If the Broncos are victorious, Manning will make history as the first quarterback to win the title with two separate teams. He won with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006

The disc had been pressing on a nerve, and after the surgery he discovered his right tricep was very weak, and he was unable to grip properly with his right hand.

The disc herniated again, and Manning went in for a second operation, before being dropped by the Colts and having to build his career up again.

Now, with two vertebrae fused together, he is stronger than ever, and luckily for the Broncos Manning also hinted that he may be staying put.Â 

Manning has thrown a record-breaking season so far, with 5 touchdown passes and 5,447 yards

He added: 'In two years I feel like we've seen a lot, as far as on the field situations, weather, crowd noise, you name it, so I do feel comfortable.'

Super Bowl XLVIII will take place on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, in front of 82,500 fans.

The last time the Seahawks played in a Super Bowl was in 2005 when they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
