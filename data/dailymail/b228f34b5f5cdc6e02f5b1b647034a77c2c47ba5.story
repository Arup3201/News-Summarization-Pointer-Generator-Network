These CCTV pictures shows the moment hooded thugs waged war on gardeners on a plot of allotments in Newcastle.

The images show two intruders, one wearing a beekeeper's mask, entering the gardens under the cover of darkness before smashing greenhouses, cutting waterpipes and tearing leeks out of the ground.

Acid has been thrown on the chairman of the allotments' car, which has also had its windows smashed, as the violence continues to escalate.

Two intruders were caught on CCTV entering Nuns Moor allotments, Newcastle upon Tyne, before they smashed greenhouse windows and tore vegetables out of the ground

Caught in the act: The thugs, who are also thought to be responsible for cutting waterpipes and slashing polytunnels, have not been caught

The attackers, who are yet to be caught, were seen on camera entering the greenhouses with their faces hidden.

They are believed to be the same people who attacked Nuns Moor allotments' chairman Karen Brown's car, as well as putting up posters of her around Fenham, Tyneside.  

Ms Brown, a 51-year-old manager at the Care Quality Commission, said: 'I was at home watching TV in my living room when I heard windows smash outside my front door. 

'I ran to the window and saw glass all over the drive. It's terrible, I'm really shaken up.

'I don't feel safe in my own home and I'm scared to walk down the street in fear of being attacked. I've lost trust in my community.'

Repairs to the car cost more than £200, and she has also had to pay for her greenhouse to be fixed after 11 windows were broken and the door was kicked in.

Karen Brown, chairman of the allotments, has had to pay hundreds of pounds for repairs to the greenhouses and her car, which has also been attacked

The posters outside Ms Brown's home, some of which say 'Get Karen Brown out', were the final straw, with the harassment forcing her to quit.

Signs attacking Ms Brown have been put up around the Fenham area of Newcastle, forcing her to quit from the allotments' committee

'It's inconceivable what they've done, they've undermined me and I will step down as chairman in January,' Ms Brown, who has worked with disadvantaged children for 20 years, said.

'A lot of gardeners want me to resist it but now that they've come to my home, it's a very different matter.

'These attacks are all about causing gardeners pain, people are scared to go back to the site and are leaving their gardens messy.

'This has resulted in our landlord wanting to shut some of the site down.'

Fellow committee member Paul Florentine had his show crop of leeks slashed and polytunnels destroyed.

The vandalism, which took place throughout the growing season, also saw retired Robert Robson's car scratched with keys outside his allotment.  

A meeting was held over how to keep the site open and it was decided to close off some of the plots.

Inspector Alan Davison, from Northumbria Police, said: 'Police are aware of ongoing issues at Nuns Moor allotments and we are working with the allotments working group to tackle these issues. 

'Measures have been put in place and officers are carrying out regular patrols.'
