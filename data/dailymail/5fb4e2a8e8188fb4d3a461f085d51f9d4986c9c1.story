Seven people have been arrested by police investigating alleged abuse at a care home where residents were apparently locked in an unheated 'quiet room' overnight.

The four men and three women were held on suspicion of mistreating or failing to properly look after people with learning difficulties.

Devon and Cornwall Police launched the investigation in November 2011 after reports that vulnerable adults were being poorly treated at the Veilstone care home near Bideford.

Residents at Veilstone Care Home (pictured), near Bideford, were allegedly locked overnight in an unheated room which contained only a blow-up mattress, a chair and a CCTV camera

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) also carried out unannounced visits and issued its owners with a formal warning for failing to meet welfare standards.

They raised concerns about a 'quiet room' where residents spent time or slept overnight, while being monitored by a surveillance camera, describing it as 'unsuitable'.

The report states how care workers told inspectors residents were 'verbally prompted or physically assisted' into the room. Inspectors discovered the unheated room contained nothing more than an armchair, an air mattress and a security camera.

The report states: 'The window was locked, so there was no ventilation in the room if the door was closed, and there was no curtain or other window covering to promote privacy (the room is on the ground floor and can easily be looked into).'

It goes on to say: 'We were told by the manager that the "quiet room" was used as a place for people to relax but it had no features of a relaxing, calming nature, as it lacked any form of stimuli and was stark and cold.'

One of the residents who allegedly faced abuse at Veilstone had suffered abuse at the scene of Britain's worst care home scandal, Winterbourne View, in Bristol.

The seven people arrested yesterday have been questioned and bailed in relation to offences under the Mental Health Act.

The
alleged abuse is said to have taken place at a number of cares homes in
Devon run by Atlas Project Team Limited, which is no longer in 
operation.

Alison Millar a 
specialist lawyer in abuse claims from law firm Leigh Day, who 
represents clients from the Winterbourne View care home and Veilstone, 
said: 'We are currently acting on behalf of a number of residents at 
homes run by the Atlas Group in relation to abuse allegations.

'The
allegations we have heard make us believe this could be one of the 
worst incidents of abuse towards vulnerable adults in residential care 
and, moreover, that the abuse at Winterbourne View, which was shockingly
exposed by Panorama, was not just an isolated occurrence but a symptom 
of a more systematic problem in the care sector.

Solicitors representing residents at Veilstone and Winterbourne (pictured) have said the allegations suggest a 'systematic problem in the care sector'

'We
would encourage anyone with further information on the homes to come 
forward and speak to the police to assist the ongoing investigation.'

At
the time of the CQC inspections, Ian Biggs, deputy director of CQC in 
the South, said the care methods were 'old fashioned' and 'stuck in the 
past'.

'The allegations we have heard make us 
believe...that the abuse at 
Winterbourne View...was not 
just an isolated occurrence but a symptom of a more systematic problem 
in the care sector'

The arrested men are aged 38, 39, 42 and 67, while the women were aged 24, 26 and 28.

All have since been released on police bail until March while investigations continue.

Detective Inspector Steve White said: 'Throughout the investigation the safety, welfare and protection of vulnerable adults has been and remains the absolute priority of all the organisations involved.

'Due to the nature of the enquiry and complex needs of the victims this investigation will take many months.

'Throughout this time the police will continue to work closely with all agencies involved and the victims and families of those affected will receive ongoing support.'
