Royal Mail staff saw bonuses rise by almost two thirds last year, despite missing a key first-class delivery target, according to reports.

Managers at the postal operator received a 62 per cent increase in bonuses from £1,674 in 2010-2011 to £2,717 last year.

The rise which is set by rules agreed by minsters, has been criticised by union bosses and Labour, who said that consumers would be 'dismayed'.

Increase: Royal mail managers received a 62 per cent increase in bonuses from £1,674 in 2010-2011 to £2,717 last year

The Daily Telegraph reported that the increase followed a failure to meet a key delivery target in the same financial year, with 
92.7 per cent of first class and meter franked mail delivered, missing the 93 per cent goal.

The bonus increase, thought to apply to thousands of managers, was initiated despite a sharp rise in the cost of stamps.

Bonus: Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene was given a £371,000 bonus last year, resulting in a total salary of £1.1million

First-class stamps rise from 46p to 60p and second class stamps from 36p
to 50p in April.

The figures were obtained using Freedom of information laws, although Royal mail does publish information on payouts to directors.

Chief executive Moya Greene was given a £371,000 bonus, resulting in a total salary of £1.1 million.

Labour’s postal affairs 
spokesman Ian Murray told the Daily Telegraph he would be writing to Miss Greene to complain.

He said: 'Consumers and businesses will be completely dismayed to hear that Royal
Mail managers have received such a substantial increase in bonus 
payments at a time when stamp prices have increased disproportionately 
and delivery standards have slipped.'

A Royal Mail spokesman said the bonuses were not as high as they could 
have been due to the missed targets.

They said that Royal Mail increased group 
profit from £18 million to £152 million in 2010/11, deeming it a 'very significant turnaround'.

Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of the postal union the CWU, said postal workers would be 'shocked'.
