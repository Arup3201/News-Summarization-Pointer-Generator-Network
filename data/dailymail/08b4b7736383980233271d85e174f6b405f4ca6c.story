A man who was once too ashamed to be seen in public has found a new lease of life after losing an incredible 18st.

Wayne Robinson, 37, from Carlisle, embarked upon a strict diet nine months ago after deciding he had had enough of missing out on life because of his size.

As a last resort before considering gastric band surgery, 31st Wayne decided instead to overhaul his diet and lifestyle.

Less than a year later, he has lost more than half his bodyweight - and says he has never felt better.

The drastic weight loss has literally saved family man Wayne’s life. Now Wayne enjoys a very active lifestyle and is a great role model for his three sons.

'People often think there should have been one life changing moment that made me decide once and for all to lose weight but there really wasn’t', explains 37-year old Wayne from Carlisle.

Big loser: Wayne Robinson has lost nearly 18 stone in just nine months after embarking on a rigorous weight loss programme when he feared he wouldn't live to see his children grow up

Rather he feels that it was a combination of a number of factors that prompted him to do something about his weight.

'I’d had no major health scare to speak of, although at the size I was I generally tended to avoid the embarrassment of visiting the doctors. But I truly believe I was in denial for many years, because with a BMI over double what it should be at 59 it wasn’t a case of if I fell ill, it was when.'

'I was a ticking timebomb health wise, but still that wasn’t enough to make me lose weight. What really made me decide to do it were my boys and the thought of them growing up without a Dad.

'I vividly remember reading somewhere that the life expectancy for someone with a BMI of 40 was 20 years less than someone with a healthy BMI around 25. That made me realise that I was living on borrowed time.'

Wayne lost his mother in his mid 20s to bowel cancer and he says he didn’t want that for his boys. He wanted to be around to see them grow up, get married and have children of their own so decided to take action.

Motivated: Wayne decided to embark on a strict diet after he became too embarrassed to attend his children's parents evening for fear of them getting bullied because of his size

Wayne turned to the LighterLife Weight Loss Management programme, attending counsellor Paula Carruthers’ classes in Carlisle.

When he started at the beginning of February 2012, he weighed 30st 13lbs.

The programme saw him replace ordinary eating with four specially formulated food packs per day, alongside weekly counselling sessions to assess the psychological issues behind overeating and ensure a permanent lifestyle change.

Wayne is now gradually reintroducing food in a controlled manner combined with counselling and has shrunk to 13st 4lbs, taking his weight loss to 17st 9lbs. His BMI currently resides at 25.4.

'The change has been unbelievable. It's not just physical: inside I am a completely different person' Wayne said.

'My life had come to the point where I was making a conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations, from having to ask for a seat belt extender on planes to never attending parents’ evening at my sons’ school so they wouldn’t get bullied about my size.

Happy: Wayne has been enjoying spending time with his children and being able to be involved in all the holiday activities like going on a rollercoaster

'Don’t get me wrong - I was no shrinking violet and was a very sociable guy, I just avoided certain everyday situations.

'If I am honest, it was more than just the everyday situations; I was even avoiding extremely serious appointments.

'For example, my mum died of bowel cancer at the age of 45, so when I reached 35 I was supposed to go for a routine screening to make sure it could be caught early if I was unlucky enough to have it as well.

'I’d received the letter from the hospital but I was so worried that the hospital wouldn’t be able to do it because of the size of me that I didn’t go.

'Even though I knew one of major reasons that mum died was because it wasn’t detected earlier, the embarrassment and fear kept me away.

'I never want to feel like that again.'

Wayne puts his weight gain down to a combination of factors, one being that from the age of 16 he did a job where he sat behind a desk most of the day.

By the time he married wife Samantha at the age of 23 he was already tipping the scales at 20 stone and by the time his mother died four years later, he was nearly 26 stone.

And for Wayne, it wasn't just food, it was alcohol to blame too.

'While I’ve never had a problem with drink, I could easily get through 10 or 12 pints of beer on a night out.

'I now realise that it was more to do with how comfortable I felt in social situations rather than a need to drink. I would drink to rid myself of those social inhibitions that told me people were looking at me due to my size.'

But since embarking on his rigorous diet, Wayne hasn't looked back.

He said: 'Over the last 10 months I have literally been the miraculous shrinking man. My weight loss has far exceeded all my expectations; in 40 weeks I have averaged half a stone weight loss per week, which is incredible.'

Wayne is now able to enjoy time with his sons, William aged 14, Harry who is 11 and four year old Finley, on trips and family holidays.

'For once in my life I could run around with the boys all day, going on rollercoasters without the fear of being too big for the seat.

'When we got back Harry said to me that it was the best family holiday he’d ever had. I know it wasn’t the nicest place we’ve ever stayed, but I agree with him.

'I put it down to the fact that I could join in with everything they did. I have a real zest for life now and the look of excitement on my sons’ faces will stay with me forever.'

'The world is my oyster now and after losing all this weight I feel euphoric and like I can do anything that I put my mind to.'
