A cute baby girl has starred in a new YouTube video which shows her tap dancing in her US home as her dad praises her footwork and suggests that she should be in Riverdance.

Baby Prayer Noelle is just over a year old - and she loves to dance. She first developed a penchant for arm flapping and then she became interested in moving her feet and dancing.

Baby Prayer's wears Korean slippers in the 41-second video and she seems to enjoy the sound they make as she smiles incessantly throughout the video.

Baby girl Prayer Noelle is a natural little dancer and she demonstrates her footwork in the video

Dressed in just a nappy and her pink Korean slippers, baby Prayer repeatedly taps her feet and occasionally spins as she navigates her way around her home.

The infant also seems to enjoy the varying sounds she makes as she moves between a mahogany wooden floor and a tiled surface.

The talented infant is encouraged to keep dancing by her enamoured father who admires her stylish footwork and then says: 'Good dancing woo, you doing some Riverdance?'

Her exuberance and enthusiasm for the sounds and for the movement are infectious

Prayer lifts her legs and swings her arms as she has fun dancing in front of her adoring father

The one year-old also manoeuvres a twirl during her memorable dancing routine
