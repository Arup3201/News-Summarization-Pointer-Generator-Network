A podiatric surgeon has been found guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct after patients have been left with complications from foot surgery to remedy bunions.

Dr Paul Bours, a Sydney based foot surgeon, has defended the claims and has called the case brought against him by the Health Complaints Commission a 'witch hunt'.

The complaints come from former patients who are allegedly suffering from issues stemming from surgery performed by Dr Bours to fix their foot ailments.

One woman had three toes amputated as a result of surgery for bunions by Dr Bours, and two other patients now have different size feet, reported The Daily Telegraph. 

While Dr Bours is now operating under conditions imposed by the Podiatry Council, he has 'vigorously defended' the charges, stating that the case had been brought against him because the Commission was wary of new surgical methods used by the podiatric surgeon.

Dr Bours said that the Commission preferred traditional orthopedic methods while he operated using surgery that was minimally invasive.

The podiatric surgeon was found that he had failed to obtain informed consent, and have failed to warn his patients of potential risks and complications that could arise from the surgery he was performing on them.  

The Civil and Administrative Tribunal said that Dr Bours was an experienced practitioner, but noted that the matters brought before them were not related to complexity of medical practice.

'They are fundamental matters that are basic to safe, ethical, wise and professional practice,' it said. 

The tribunal heard that a 24-year-old female patient of Dr Bours was treated for a bunion on her left toe, after going in for treatment for toenail fungus in 2011.

The complaints come from four former patients who were told by Dr Bours that he could fix their foot ailments, and are now suffering from resulting issues, the Commission claims.

The patient claimed Dr Bours told her 'the surgery is a walk in the park and there is a two-week recovery'.

The tribunal said the podiatric surgeon had employed scare tactics to encourage her to undergo the surgery, and showed her images of infected feet which he told her she would develop if she chose not to have the procedure.

The patient claimed Dr Bours told her 'the surgery is a walk in the park and there is a two-week recovery'. 

At the Darlinghurst Day Surgery, the woman had all of her toes fused and the bunion removed from her big left toe, but after recurring pain and restriction of movement in her digits, was forced to undergo a second surgery where the bone was shaved.

After being informed by Dr Bours that she required a third surgery, she sought a different medical opinion and was told she had developed osteoarthritis after her second surgery.

The patient's toe joint was damaged, and that she required more surgery to remove bone fragments from her foot.

The woman is now looking at the possibility of ongoing pain, is no longer able to wear high heels and has difficulty walking, the Tribunal heard.

Another patient was heard to have had his feet operated on, and found the pins which were holding his joints together protruding from his bone by a centimeter. 

Dr Bours denied these claims, and abused a colleague, calling him a 'gutless ***t', believing him to have written a report for the Commission. 

 Dr Bours had recently been in the media for performing 'vanity surgeries' on women who wanted their feet to fit into fashionable high heels.
