Saint Joseph's head coach Phil Martelli has definitely inspired one person on the sidelines.

During the school's Atlantic-10 title win over VCU, CBS cameras captured the coach's grandson Philip dressed in a full suit and imitating his grandfather through the game.

Whenever coach Martelli rubbed his jaw with worry over the next play, four-year-old Philip did the same.

Two of a kind: Martelil's grandson mirrored his every move

That wasn't the end of the hilarious mimicry.

Philip yelled when the coach yelled and crossed his arms when the coach did.

He even had his own whiteboard to sketch some plays.

Future coach: All eyes will be on Philip at the team's next appearance

St. Joseph went on to win 65-61 with their miniature coach in the wings all the way. 

While Philip might be too young to be the real head coach just yet, there's little doubt that eyes will be on him at the Hawk's next game.
