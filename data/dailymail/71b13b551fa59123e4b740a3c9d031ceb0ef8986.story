While travellers are worried about a potential ash cloud crisis caused by a volcanic eruption in Iceland, one tour operator is capitalising by offering trips to see the rumbling Bardarbunga.

Adventure company Discover the World is planning to fly customers to the eruption site – if there is one – as soon as it is safe and logistically possible to do so.

The UK-based operator has set up a ‘volcano hotline’ that allows people to sign up for the trip, and it is promising sightseeing tours that could involve helicopter flights or transport by Superjeep.

Incredible sight: Magma spews from the Fimmvorduhals volcano in south-western Iceland in 2010

Four years ago, Discover the World took about 300 people to witness the Fimmvorduhals eruption in south-western Iceland.

Some of the lucky tourists arrived within 24 hours and were fortunate enough to see spouting magma. 

The ‘tourist’ eruption occurred about a month before the Eyjafjallajokull volcano blew its top and spewed a massive ash cloud that shut down much of Europe’s airspace.

Despite the chaos that followed Eyjafjallajokull, getting to an eruption site at Bardarbunga shouldn’t be a problem, according to Discover the World.

The Icelandic travel specialists believe it is highly unlikely Europe will see an air traffic disruption similar to that of 2010 because scientists are better prepared for such an event.

Bardarbunga is Iceland’s largest volcano and is situated under the country’s largest glacier.

It has been rocked by two earthquake swarms for six days and is at risk of eruption, although there are no signs of magma moving toward the surface, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office.

As a precaution, police have evacuated an area near the volcano and closed roads, and the country’s aviation alert level has been raised to orange, the second-highest level on the five-colour scale.
