Fraudsters who duped first-time drivers into buying bogus car insurance were found to be running a fake-call centre with a soundtrack of office noise in the background, a court heard.

Danyal Bukharee, 42, masterminded the scam which involved setting up a series of 'ghost broking websites' offering premiums 15 per cent cheaper than the average.

Bukharee invented a host of staff to deal with customer enquiries and payments - including one named after the head of the City of London Police’s insurance fraud department.

On trial: Andrew Goward, 38, was recruited alongside co-defendants Saleh and Heaven to open bank accounts and to receive the money paid by the victims

The fraudsters played a track called 'Office Noise' through an iPod connected to loudspeakers, it is claimed, to give the illusion of a busy office.

Jurors heard Bukharee had pleaded guilty to operating the scam involving the four websites between May 2011 and April last year.

Four others are now on trial at the Old Bailey for either laundering the proceeds or directly assisting with the scam.

Detectives were alerted to the scam after the Motor Insurers Bureau received complaints about three car insurance websites - Aston Midshires Insurance, Astuto Insurance and Car Insurance Warehouse - in October 2011.

The investigation led to a riverside apartment in Battersea, south west London, along with the discovery that Bukharee had set up a new website, First Car Direct Insurance.

‘It was a fraud factory,’ said prosecutor Ann Mulligan. ‘There were printers, faxes, telephones, bank cards, chequebooks, mobile phones, shredders.

‘Bukharee had realised the earlier websites were under investigation and had decided to set up a new campaign.’

A
total of £40,733 had been paid by 38 customers for car insurance in the
three weeks the First Direct website was up and running, the court 
heard.

Mohamed Saleh, 26, was brought into the scam by mastermind Danyal Bukharee. The court heard that Saleh and his co-defendants must have 'at very least suspected' that what they were being asked to do was criminal

Miss Mulligan said: ‘The case involves a ghost broking website fraud - a website created for the purposes of fraud.

‘It is not in dispute that this was a sophisticated fraud and it was masterminded by Danyal Bukharee.

‘He used the four ghost broking websites to carry out car insurance fraud. He was responsible for setting up the websites, each of them purporting to offer genuine motor insurance at around a 15 per cent discount below the average price offered by genuine companies.

‘Unsuspecting members of the public were duped into buying this non-existent car insurance and paying money for it.

‘What he identified was he could target innocent members of the public, in particular young first time drivers for whom insurance premiums are extremely high, often inhibitively so.’

It is claimed Bukharee recruited Giovanni Recchia, 47, to run the First Car Direct fraud from the flat by answering phones and dealing with customer enquiries.

Recchia was with Bukharee when police arrived at the flat and acted as a witness to the tenancy agreement, the court heard.

Detectives found a whiteboard featuring the names of nine invented employees next to their roles in claims, admin and compliance, it is claimed.

One victim remembered being put through to David Wood in sales and offered a quote of £2,018 for insurance, jurors were told.

Miss Mulligan said: ‘You may think Bukharee has a sense of humour. Detective Chief Inspector David Wood is in fact head of the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department.’

Police also found an iPod connected to sound system with only one track uploaded titled ‘Office Noise.’

‘Officers listened to the track through the speaker system and what they heard being played was a busy working office, the sound of ringing phones, a call centre effect.’

Jurors heard Recchia is likely to claim he was an innocent dupe and was led to believe this was a genuine business.

‘Recchia cannot have failed to be aware that something was amiss,’ said Miss Mulligan. 'Using a name that wasn’t his has to have alerted him to the fact this was a fraudulent enterprise.’

Giovanni Recchia allegedly ran First Car Direct fraud from a flat by answering phones and dealing with customers, prosecutors said he 'cannot have failed to be aware that something was amiss'

Andrew Goward, 38, Gary Heaven, 37, and Mohamed Saleh, 26, were recruited to open bank accounts to receive the money paid in by the victims, it is claimed.

‘Once these were opened Bukharee would take over control of the accounts to enable him to access the money,’ said Miss Mulligan.

‘These three men may not have known it was a car insurance fraud specifically but what the Crown say is that at the time they opened bank accounts they did so in circumstances such that it can safely have been inferred they must have known or at the very least suspected they were doing it for criminal purposes.’

Goward is said to have received proceeds from the Astuto Insurance and Car Insurance Warehouse between May and August 2011.

Heaven and Saleh are said to have received the proceeds from the Aston Midshires Insurance fraud between August 2011 and January 2012.

Buckharee, from Putney, south London, has admitted two counts of fraud by false representation and three counts of money laundering.

Recchia, from Retford, Nottinghamshire, denies one count of fraud by false representation.

Heaven, from Tulse Hill, south London, Goward, from Nottingham, and Saleh, from Greenford, north west London, all deny money laundering.

The trial continues.
