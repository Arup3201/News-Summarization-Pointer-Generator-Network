Beware the hotel front desk. Not only do they hold the key to your room, they also hold the key to the difference between an average or a premier stay.

Knowing  how to ask staff for things, how much to tip, how to book, when to push your cause and when definitely not to can transform the service you receive. 

Doyen of the hotel industry Jacob Tomsky and author of Heads In Beds: A Reckless Memoir Of Hotels, Hustles, And So-Called Hospitality started life as a valet in New Orleans more than a decade ago and rose through the ranks to land a front desk job in New York.

Jacob Tomsky says never book through discount websites such as Expedia or you'll get the worst rooms

As a result, he knows some of the best and worst secrets of the industry and shared some  with Metal Floss. Here, we run through some of his best revelations.

1.) Hotels make a packet on room rates

According to Jacob, the average cost to turn over a room and keep it sleep-worthy is just £25 ($40). That covers everything from washing sheets to electricity, hourly wages for housekeepers, minibar attendants, front desk agents and cleaning supplies. In other words, the whole shebang.

'The fact that a hotel could fail to be profitable astounds me,' says Jacob. Given that the average price of a four star hotel in London is about £140, they should be raking it in. Stay somewhere that costs much less than £25 a night and you'll know some serious corners are being cut. 

The average cost to keep a room operational is £25 ($40) so anything that costs less than that you should avoid

2.) Never pay for the mini bar

Mini bars sit in every hotel room begging you to spend money. Amazingly, Jacob says you can almost always wriggle out of paying for them.

According to him, the process for applying a mini bar bill is always horribly inexact and anything from keystroke errors, delays in restocking, double stocking and many other mishaps can cause miscalculations. People at the front desks don't want an argument.

Jacob says, 'Even before guests can manage to get through half of the 'I never had those items' sentence, I have already removed the charges and am now simply waiting for them to wrap up the overly zealous denial so we can both move on with our lives.'

Happy hour: Employees hate haggling with guests over the bar bill as all too often processing issues can occur

3.) Phrase it right

Getting the front desk to take your latest gripe seriously can  be tricky. Jacob has some tips.

'Though most complaints should be delivered to the front desk directly, in person or on the phone, keep in mind that most issues will not have been caused by the front desk at all. 

So briefly outline your problem, offer a solution if you have one, and then ask whom you should speak with to have the problem solved. 'Should I speak to a manager about this?' 'Should I speak to housekeeping about this?' Those are wonderful and beautiful questions to ask.'

Make it personal: Asking for the person's name who is dealing with your complaint will get it fixed faster

Best  of all? Ask for the employees name as nothing concentrates the mind better than knowing you can identify them later if everything is not resolved.

4.) Don't book on discount sites and expect the world

It's obvious but if you want the best room you have to fork out for it. Hotels  give those who book through last minute discounts sites such as Expedia the worst, smallest dingiest rooms. They know you've come to them because of a one-off deal - rather than through their own website - and most likely won't be a repeat visitor.

It's obvious, but if you want the best room you have to fork out for it. Discount sites get given smallest rooms

James explains, 'First of all, we earn the slimmest profit from these reservations...[Secondly] since we have no reason to assume Internet guests will ever book with us again, unless our discount is presented to them, it truly makes business sense to save our best rooms for guests who book of their own volition.'

5.) Tip like your life depends on it

Every front desk wields a certain amount of power when it comes to awarding a guest a better time, and they're almost always authorised to upgrade for special occasions. 

Money talks: According to Jacob, all you need is £12 ($20) tip to ensure the front desk is in your pocket

Birthday or anniversary? Almost every front desk employee has the ability to upgrade for special occasions 

There's always a room with a bigger TV screen, a room that, according to the building's layout, has a larger bath and two sinks or a room that although listed as standard has a great view.

All it takes? A decent tip. 'When I feel that $20 (£12) you slipped me burning in my pocket, I will find [that upgrade] for you. And if there is nothing to be done room-wise, I have a slew of other options: late checkout, free movies, free minibar, room service amenities, and more. I will do whatever it takes to deserve the tip and then a little bit more in the hope that you’ll hit me again.'

Play nice: To ensure you're not first on the list to get pushed from an overbooked hotel don't be rude to staff

6.) Don't be shafted 

Like  airlines,  hotels overbook rooms to compensate when people don't show up. Most guests still have to pay at least a 10 per cent charge for a no-show, so if the hotel fills the room on top of that they're laughing. If you're unlucky and everyone shows up the front desk will have to send some people packing or put them up for a night elsewhere.

To ensure it's not you Jacob suggests (if you can) not using a discount site when booking, being a repeat customer, booking in for more than one night and not being rude or obnoxious to staff.
