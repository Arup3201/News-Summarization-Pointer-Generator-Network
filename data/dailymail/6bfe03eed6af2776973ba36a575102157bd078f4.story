Animal rights group Peta has released an undercover video allegedly showing cruelty to race horses in a yard belonging to a top trainer.

The video, filmed over four-months by a Peta investigator, claims to show Steve Asmussen and his yard hands giving horses pain medications and joking about jockeys use electric shocks to make the thoroughbreds run faster.

The animal activist group also claimed the yard uses undocumented workers who are provided with fake papers.

Medicated: Peta claims horses at the racing yard were given medication whether they needed it or not

During the video, the unnamed investigator filmed as tranquilizers were allegedly given to horses whether they needed them or not.

One vet was also filmed saying all the horses in the yard were given a performance-enhancing drug.

In another recorded conversation, between Asmussen, his assistant Scott Blasi and a farrier, the men discuss how racehorse Nehro, who came second at the 2011 Kentucky Derby, had damaged his legs to the point where his hooves were ground into nubs.

The horse remained in training despite the injury, and during the conversation the men discuss how they tried to fill a hole in his hoof with superglue, Gawker reported.

They state on the film that the injury was caused by part of the hoof rotting away under the Z-bar shoe that is fitted to racehorses.

'His foot is a little bitty nub,' the blacksmith can be heard saying. 'He lost Z-bars on both feet many times until he had bloody holes in the bottom of his feet.'

Nehro continued to race through the injury, up until his death at a race track a year later. The cause of death was said to be colic.

Blasi described the horse's last moments on film, saying: 'I've seen a lot of s***. That is the most violent f****** death I have ever seen.'

Peta claims its footage, filmed by an investigator working in Louiseville, Kentucky, and Saratoga Springs, New York, also shows the callous disregard horse trainers and owners have towards the thoroughbreds.

In a shot filmed at what appeared to be a dinner party, trainers and jockeys joke about how everyone uses buzzers to administer electric shocks to the horses to make them run faster.

Peta has filed complaints with federal and state agencies in Kentucky and New York, claiming Asmussen 'forced injured and/or suffering horses to race and train'.

Allegations: Peta has filed complaints against race trainer Steve Asmussen

Clark Brewster, a lawyer for Asmussen and Blasi, told the New York Times: 'It is certainly a surprise to Mr Asmussen and Mr Blasi that anyone would deceptively get a job and keep surveillance and their notes on their conduct for the agenda of others.

'They will reserve comment with regard to any accusations until they have had the opportunity to fully review them. Then they will respond factually.'

Kathy Guillermo, senior vice-president of Peta, said the organization went undercover to check on the treatment of horses at racing stables.

'It was devastating to see sore, exhausted, drugged horses every single day. Some were in so much pain it hurt them even to stand, yet they were trained and run anyway,' she said.
