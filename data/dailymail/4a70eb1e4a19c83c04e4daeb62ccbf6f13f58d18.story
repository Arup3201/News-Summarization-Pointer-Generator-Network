Three Tottenham Hotspur football fans are in hospital today after being attacked by a mob of masked French hooligans chanting Nazi slogans.

A gang of up to 50 thugs attacked an English-style pub in Lyon, where the north London club are due to play a Europa League match tonight.

Police believe that the violence in the Smoking Dog, in the city's old town, was 'of an anti-Semitic' nature and 'well-coordinated'.

Aftermath: Around 150 Tottenham fans were attacked by a mob of French Nazi hooligans at the Smoking Dog Pub in Lyon which was left with smashed windows and doors ripped off their hinges

Attack: A smashed mirror and broken chair lie on the the floor of the Smoking Dog pub, the scene of what French police described as 'anti-semitic' violence

It saw flares thrown into the pub, 
which was packed with around 150 Spurs fans watching the European Cup 
game between AC Milan and Barcelona on TV.

'Doors and windows were smashed open, 
and then chairs were thrown at the English fans,' said a local police 
spokesman, who confirmed that other bars were also targeted.

It is thought that those responsible for the attack were a far right group, rather than Lyon football fans.

'The attackers wore balaclavas and 
other face masks, and were chanting as they carried out the attack,' 
said the police source. 'Their chants was of an anti-Semitic nature.

'They caused as much damage as 
possible, ran off, and then came back again a few minutes later. Three 
English fans were seriously injured and taken to hospital.'

Tottenham supporter Christian 
Radnedge said: 'They came in at around half past 10. There were lots of 
Spurs fans in the pub. It was fit to burst.

'Then around 20 masked men came towards the pub. The glass was smashed, missiles were thrown into the pub.

'The owner of the pub said there were 25 of them. They came in making Nazi salutes. It was frightening.

'They
left and then we thought that was it, but five minutes later it started
again. More stuff was thrown in through the windows and then they left.

'The
intruders did not get in to the bar because it was full of Spurs fans. 
There were drips of blood left in the bar. The owners barricaded the pub
between the two waves of attacks.'

David Eales, the landlord of the 
Smoking Dog who is originally from Retford, Nottinghamshire, said: 'At 
10.18 the pub was rammed with Tottenham fans watching the Champions 
League on the television.

'The front of the pub, which is made up of reinforced glass, was attacked by between 20 and 25 people.

'They threw projectiles through the 
windows. There was a stand-off. They didn't get into the bar. Then it 
calmed down. Then they came back a second time and it all started again.

'There were three injured Tottenham fans taken away by ambulance. One of them had a head injury. I'm not sure how bad it was.'

Mr Eales, 42, attended last week's 
first leg of the Spurs- Lyon clash at White Hart Lane, which passed off 
without incident, as a Lyon fan.

He had invited Spurs supporters to his
bar while in London, and anticipated trouble from far-right groups in 
Lyon because Tottenham traditionally has a big Jewish following.

Mr Eales said: 'The most disappointing
thing is that I spoke to the police a couple of days ago about the 
potential for trouble because of what people associate Tottenham being. 
There will be a big presence on the match day, but tonight it didn't 
happen.'

It is the second time that Spurs fans have been targeted by anti-Semitic hooligans in the last three months.

In November, some were ambushed inside a pub in Rome on the eve of their game against Lazio.

Tottenham fan Christian Radnege, who was in 
the bar at the time of the attack, said: 'They came in making Nazi 
salutes. It was frightening.

'Rome was fresh in everyone's minds. Everyone realised this was serious.

'They left and then we thought that was it, but five minutes later it started again.

'The intruders did not get into the bar because it was full of Spurs 
fans. There were drips of blood left in the bar. The owners barricaded 
the pub between the two waves of attacks.'

Another fan James Taylor had driven 
through the night from his home in Ilford, Essex, to attend tonight's 
Europa League second round second leg clash.

He said the attack 'was pre-meditated, pre-arranged. It was nothing to do with Spurs fans.

'We were in the pub having a few drinks at about 10pm. There were about 150 Spurs fans singing. It was all in good nature.

'Then there was a bang. We ignored the
first one and there was a second one, suddenly. The windows were 
smashed and stools were thrown into the pub. We ran back to hide.

'We were stuck in the back of the pub for about half an hour. We were worried. No Spurs fans were violent or too drunk.'

A spokesman for Britain's Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office said: 'We are aware of reports of an attack on 
British nationals in France and are offering consular assistance.'

A Tottenham Hotspur spokesman said: 
'Club officials attended an incident last night in Lyon. A group of 
around 50 people confronted fans.

'The situation was dealt with and 
arrests were made within the hour. Three fans sustained minor injuries 
and received prompt medical assistance.

'Spurs officials and stewards will be in the city throughout the day, along with matchday French police ahead of kick-off.'

The Smoking Dog Pub on Rue Lainerie on the cobbled
streets of Lyon's old town had its dark red shutters closed when we arrived at
around midnight local time.

We had already met groups of Spurs fans in the street;
many just groups of ordinary young lads who had driven through the night to
follow their team. They were shocked but many were starting to feel angry, too;
angry that their club had been targeted again. All were critical of the
response of the French police.

The Smoking Dog is a narrow pub with reinforced glass
windows at the front, wooden floors and benches, a crowded bar to your right
and a slightly narrower back room. This is what had scared the English and
Scots who drink their regularly: there is only one way out and that is through
the front door, which is where the gang attacked. Spurs fans had been trapped
inside.

The landlord Dave Eales, who has run the pub since 1995
but is originally from Retford in Nottinghamshire, was trying to make sense of
it all. There had been a quick and concerted clean up operation by the time we
arrived, with the British community in Lyon quick to help a friend in need, but
everyone looked visibly shocked - particularly a girl who had been working
behind the bar. She could barely speak.

The glass and bits of broken bar stools had been swept
away and the floors had been cleaned of the drops of blood and beer that had
been spilled in the panic. But the collection of items that had been hurled
into the pub - including a flare - by the gang in two waves of attacks was
chilling. There were cast-iron table legs and the kind of large circular weight
used to secure a patio umbrella.

One man said how a Spurs fan had rushed behind the bar
into a back office when the attack happened, urging the bar staff to barricade
themselves inside.

'I was in Rome and I've got a two-year-old baby,' he
said. 'This can't keep happening.'

There was certainly that sense of disbelief. The pub
staff expressed it in the way they described the gang of hooded men doing Nazi
salutes on their front door and the Spurs fans had the same tone as they
discussed the events of Rome.

Both agreed on another thing, too. This attack
had nothing to do with football.

Brutal: Ten supporters were hurt and one seriously injured in the Rome attack, while two Roma fans were charged with attempted murder

In the last decade English football fans have been the subject of a series of knife attacks when going to support their team at games in Rome

The attack on the Tottenham fans is the latest in a long series assaults on suspected Jews in Lyon, which has a long history of anti-Semitism.

Last year a gang of 10 youths attacked three Jewish men with hammers and metal bars.

It led to Jewish community leader Joel Mergui saying: 'Not a week passes without anti-Semitic assaults in France. I refuse to believe Jews will be forced to choose between security and their Jewish identity.'

Richard Wertenschlag, chief rabbi of the Grand Synagogue in Lyon, called the atmosphere 'unbearable.;

'These incidents are becoming more and more frequent, so much so, alas, as to make one take them for granted,' he said.

Lyon's dark history of anti-Semitism extends back centuries, and includes Klaus Barbie, the so-called 'Butcher of Lyon' - a Nazi who tortured and murdered hundreds of Jews with the help of French collaborators during World War II.
