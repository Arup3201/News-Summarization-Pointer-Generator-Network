Fape? Six-year-olds are being asked to read the words to test their literacy levels in tests carried out this summer

A Government initiative to test school literacy levels will see more than 500,000 six-year-olds asked to read ‘words’ such as jound, terg, fape and snemp.

During the summer term, teachers will sit down individually with every Year 1 child and ask them to read the so-called ‘pseudo-words’ as a way of gauging reading levels.

Officials preparing this year’s test are having to ensure that none of the non-words is offensive or rude in the mother tongue of pupils whose first language is not English.

The Government is pushing ahead with using the pseudo-words in the tests despite the results of a public consultation in which two-thirds of people said they should not be included.

The non-words will have a picture of an imaginary creature next to them as a signal that the word is made up and could be the name of the pretend creature.

Each child will have to read  a total of 40 words; 20 real ones such as week, chill, grit and start as well as 20 non-words such as spron, stroft and ulf.

The idea is that the test will establish how well schools are teaching phonics, a system in which children learn the sounds that groups of letters make rather than just remembering what different words look like.

The results will be fed back to the Department for Education, which will use them to compare schools and analyse whether it helps to improve reading.

Professor Dominic Wyse of the Institute of Education said: ‘Clearly, non-words don’t have any meaning. Understanding meaning is the essence of reading so we must ask if this test really assesses reading.

‘Attention to other aspects of reading such as enjoyment and comprehension are likely to be restricted because of the focus on phonics.’

The Government is taking action after it was revealed last year that one child in six fails to reach the required reading level before going to secondary school.
