A shipment of highly radioactive material has been safely recovered after sitting in the cornfield where it was found a week ago dumped by truck thieves in central Mexico.

The truckload of cobalt-60, a material that can be used to make dirty bombs, was secured on Tuesday evening and the Mexican nuclear safety director confirmed that the week-long saga is now under wraps.

Juan Eibenschutz, director general of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, said a robot was used to scoop up the dangerous material and deposit it in a safe container for transporting to a nuclear waste treatment facility.

Carefully handled: A robotic arm was used to recover the radioactive cobalt-60 that was discovered abandoned in the middle of farmland in central Mexico

Under watch: Even though the material was secured on Tuesday afternoon, 100 federal police, marines and local officers are still guarding the area

'It's been recovered, and it's on its way to the waste site,' he said.

Earlier Tuesday, Eibenschutz had said the cobalt-60 was still in the field because emergency workers hadn't been able to get the robot close enough due to bales of corn stalks in the field. He said workers were clearing a path.

Containment: The material, which is normally used in making dirty bombs, was stored in a container approved by the country's nuclear safety board

'Things turned out well,' he said a few hours later.

'The operators of the robot prepared everything and were able to secure the material.'

The federal police force said it provided the robot.

The final statement revealed that 100 federal police, marines and local officers are still guarding the area.

Eibenschutz said a farmer was being checked at a hospital after showing signs of radiation exposure.

The
man, who lives in the nearby farming town of Hueypoxtla, told 
authorities that he handled the material after finding it in the field 
and started feeling sick soon after.

The
cobalt-60, which was from obsolete medical equipment used in radiation 
therapy, was being transported to a waste facility by a truck that was 
stolen at gunpoint early December 2 when the driver stopped to rest at a
gas station in Hidalgo state.

Two days later, authorities found the truck abandoned in neighboring Mexico state.

The thieves had removed the cobalt-60 from its protective container and left it nearby in the field about a half a mile from Hueypoxtla, a town of about 4,000 people.

Found: A container of cobalt-60, similar to this one, was found 1lkm away from the truck it was being carried in

Calming fears: Mexico's National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards (CNSNS), which reported the theft to the IAEA, said the material posed no risk provided it was not broken or tampered with

Officials have said the material posed no threat to the town, saying it was dangerous only in close proximity.

On Monday, a federal judge ordered five people held for 40 days under a form of house arrest pending possible charges.

Four of the detainees are suspected in the theft of the truck and the fifth was allegedly a possible buyer of the stolen vehicle, said an official with the Attorney General's Office, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

The farmer exposed to radiation is not a suspect in the case, authorities said.
