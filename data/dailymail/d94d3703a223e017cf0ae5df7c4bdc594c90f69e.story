Saints: The basement in the home of Richard Prosser, 65, and his wife Jean, 63, in Palestine, Hampshire is dedicated to his favourite club

Football-mad husbands can be trying.

They monopolise the TV when matches are on, squander money on memorabilia and bore for Britain on subjects such as the transfer market.

Yet all that pales into insignificance compared to what Jean Prosser has put up with to satisfy her husband Richard’s obsession with Southampton FC.

Her tale of woe begins in 2001 when Richard was about to start building a new family house in the tiny hamlet of Palestine, in Hampshire.

He heard that his beloved Saints, who were moving from their ground, The Dell, were auctioning off their fixtures and fittings and decided to go along, hoping to buy some cheap timber.

While there, two far more interesting items caught Richard’s  eye – the deep touch-line dug-out used by managers and reserves, and an 1898 vintage turnstile.

‘I found myself bidding, and before  I knew it I’d paid £410 for the pair of them,’ says Richard, 65, who was a mechanical engineer.

‘When I got home and told  Jean, she said, “What the ’eck are you going to do with those – grow tomatoes in the dug-out and get people to pay to see them grow?” ’

In fact, Richard had already worked out a plan. He had previously intended the basement of his new house to be a store room.

But he phoned his architects and told them to make something far more ambitious.

With the dug-out as the centrepiece, he wanted the room to double as a shrine to the Saints and  a games room, complete with snooker and darts.

It would be somewhere to party, watch matches on a big screen and spend time with his sons, Ben, 41, Simon, 37, and Richard, 36 – and his daughter, Amy, 27.

By 2004 the house was built, with the dug-out and turnstile taking pride of place in the basement.

A neighbour, author Jeremy Lewis, heard about it and arranged for his friend, legendary former Southampton manager Lawrie McMenemy, to give it a grand opening.

To Richard’s amazement, his basement appeared on BBC South television news.

Today it has the feel of a miniature museum, its walls lined with items such as the official team sheet from the day Southampton were promoted to the Premiership two years ago, signed photos of Saints stars past and present, signed shirts, and framed newspaper reports of big games. As we sit in the dug-out, I ask him what sparked this obsession.

‘It all started in about 1960 when I was a lad and my father began taking me to see the Saints,’ recalls Richard.

‘We’d go to the games on the back of his motorbike and, one day, we passed this white Sunbeam Rapier with a red stripe on it and I thought it was absolutely fantastic.

Then the driver wound down the window and shouted “Up the Saints” at us.  My dad said, “That’s Terry Paine, son – the Saints winger.” I was hooked for life.’

We walk around the wall with the big screen to the snooker room, then pass through the turnstile and head upstairs to the rest of the house.

Score: Bramble Bank, in Palestine, Hampshire is on the market for £695,000

Richard has done well from the property booms of the past 30 years. He and Jean, 63, lived in a three-bedroom semi in Sholing, Southampton, until 1987, when they upped sticks to Palestine to be near her parents.

They bought a plot of land for £500 and built their own house, living in a caravan for a year. In 2003 they sold it for £375,000, bought the plot next door and built their present home.

This house, Bramble Bank, has an American feel. Its wide living room has a bare brick fireplace, matched by a brick serving area in the open-plan kitchen/diner.

High ceilings, windows and light oak balustrades in the hall create the feel of an atrium, and all the bedrooms are good-sized. And there are glorious views over Salisbury Plain.

Now the children have left home, the house is too big for the Prossers. It is on the market for £695,000 and Richard plans to build another, smaller house nearby. What will become of his beloved dug-out? ‘I’m open to offers if someone wants to buy it,’ he says.

The passion for moving to the country is having an unexpected effect on quiet village life. More than 100,000 people are leaving British cities for life in the countryside each year. And as many of them are well-off, can-do individuals, they are having quite an impact on the communities they move to – as sleepy village shows are ousted in favour of far more lively events.

In Mylor Bridge near Falmouth, villagers have in the past two years put on shows featuring comedian Jack Dee, guitar virtuosos John Williams and John Etheridge, 1980s and 1990s stars Toyah Willcox and Beverley Craven and blues legend Albert Lee, to name but a few. The Mylor Sessions, as the shows are called, are largely down to Steve Hutt, an ‘incomer’ to the village who has worked in the entertainment industry for years.

Chris Perkins, former chairman of the village hall committee, says: ‘The shows have brought the whole village together and inspired us to apply for and get a £500,000 lottery grant to restore the hall.’

The Mylor Sessions have also boosted the local housing market. ‘About 80 per cent of buyers come from outside Cornwall and can be nervous about moving to a small village,’ said Nigel Stubbs, the local estate agent with Jackson-Stops & Staff. ‘The Sessions are living proof that  this place is buzzing with life.’

The number of village impresarios such as Steve Hutt is growing. Typical of their number is former insurance broker Steve Dennis, who moved to Low Bradfield in the Peak District, four miles outside Sheffield, from Dorking, Surrey, in 2009. No sooner had Dennis settled into running the village stores than he set about organising folk-rock gigs by two of the country’s most highly regarded artists – Phil Beer and Steve Knightley. ‘We sold the 200 tickets for each show almost as soon as they were printed and they were very successful evenings,’ said Steve.

Putting on top acts in the village hall originated in London’s commuter belt. In Goring-on-Thames, a successful jazz club has been running since 1999. It was set up by two local men, Bill Jackson and John Calvert, fed up with having to run for the last train home when they were enjoying a night at Ronnie Scott’s.

They decided to arrange for musicians to come to them – and since then George Melly, Chris Barber, Digby Fairweather and Ian Shaw have all trodden the creaky boards at the village hall.
