Prince Philip, pictured, has started using a special mobile phone for the hard of hearing 

He only bedgrudgingly started to wear a hearing aid in public a few months ago.

But Prince Philip is already making adjustments for it in other areas of his life.

The 93-year-old royal has just started using a special mobile phone especially designed for people suffering from hearing loss, it can be revealed.

Most high street phones are not compatible for people wearing aids because of the levels of interfearence.

And while Philip’s new amplicomms M8000 is short on smart phone-style gimmicks, it can be up to 80 times louder than regular mobiles.

It also has a powerful vibrating alert - and a ringtone that can sound as loud as a road drill.

The phone also boasts a voice assisted operating system, a large keypad and screen and an SOS emergency button linked to five pre-selected numbers.

Despite his age Philip is also something of a silver surfer who regularly uses the internet and was one of the earliest users of a mobile communication device when he had one fitted in his car back in 1953, He will, therefore, no doubt be delighted with the phone’s one touch 2megapixel camera and video recorder.

The £99 phone was sent to the Queen’s husband as a gift by Hearing Direct, a firm set up by Prince William and Prince Harry’s close friend, millionaire businessman Jamie Murray Wells.

The firm received a standard thank you letter on its receipt.

But then shortly before Christmas the company received a call from Philip’s private secretary to say how much he loved it.

‘Apparently the Prince said it was the best he had ever used and his aide asked us if there were any extra accessories to go with it,’ said a company source.

Director Gary Hill added: ‘We wanted to offer our support to the Prince, hopefully with a gift that he would find really useful.

‘We spoke to a representative of HRH Prince Philip who said that The Prince is very pleased with the M8000, and it is an improvement on anything else he has used in the recent past.

‘We’ve since sent a car charger and headphones that will help keep conversations private.

‘We hope Prince Philip is benefiting from his new hearing aids. Too many people avoid wearing Hearing Aids, risking exclusion from so much happening around them.’

Prince Philip has only recently started wearing a hearing aid in public which is barely visible, left, and is said to be very pleased with his new mobile handset, similar to the one on the right, with its loud ringtone 

Philip was first seen in public wearing hearing aids on each year at a public reception last October.

It was a rare concession to his age for the prince, who normally bats off enquiries about his health with a brusque: ‘Do I look bloody ill?’

Just a fifth of people with hearing problems wear an aid because of the apparent ‘stigma’, a study by The University of Manchester found earlier last year.

Professor Kevin Munro, Ewing Professor of Audiology at The University of Manchester who worked on the study, said: ‘There still seems to be a stigma attached to wearing a hearing aid, where as there is little stigma now associated with vision loss and wearing spectacles. ‘
