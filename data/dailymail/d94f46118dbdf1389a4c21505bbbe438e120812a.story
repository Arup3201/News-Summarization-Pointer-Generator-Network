Ben Ford is a big bear of a man. Big beard, big hands, big build. By his own admission he is 'the spitting image' of his father Harrison Ford, and thinks his dad would be his size if he hadn't spent much of his life on a Hollywood diet.

Both men love to eat. Ben loves nothing better than to cook huge macho meals. He's big on meat. Big on barbecues. Big on potatoes.

In fact his new book Taming The Feast, with its instructions on how to build a barbecue from scratch, is possibly the most macho cookbook ever written.

Ben loves nothing better than cooking huge macho meals

We're at Ben's restaurant, Ford's Filling Station, in LA. The menu has years of experience behind it and a secret ingredient of homeliness he says he inherited from his mother, former cheerleader Mary Marquardt. Ben wants a new generation of men to get out there and barbecue for a crowd.

'I want to inspire people who've done it before and give them something more. Most of the recipes in the book are for eight to ten people, and I have great memories of sitting around big tables with lots of food and a little too much to drink. I wanted to reproduce those experiences.'

Ben, at 46, is the eldest of Harrison's four children (two by Mary, two by his second wife, screenwriter Melissa Mathison).

His parents' 14-year marriage fell apart when Ben was about 12, just as Harrison was starting to make it as an actor; for most of Ben's childhood his father was a carpenter.

In the past Harrison has blamed his split with Ben's mother on his new-found fame, and it was while he was going through that first divorce that he met his second wife.

Their marriage lasted 18 years before he met Calista Flockhart, who played Ally McBeal, in 2002 and they married in 2010.

Ben says that his father and Calista often come to his restaurant with Calista's 13-year-old son Liam – Harrison loves the food – and they all get on very well. 'But there weren't so many celebrity friends when my parents were together,' he adds.

'As the eldest son I missed out on the fun. My father was doing a lot of carpentry back then, and he only started to find success as I was becoming a teenager.

Dad was always fixing up the house, and he'd often take me to building sites, show me the floor joists, how everything fitted together. Seeing how meticulous he was at his craft has stayed with me as a chef.

'As you might expect from the life-changing times when he became Han Solo in Star Wars, my parents split up. But I had a wonderful stepfather in Bob Becker, who was a director of shows like Dallas and Knots Landing and loved to cook. I feel like I got the best of it, it was a good situation.'

Harrison's career began to take him all over the world – he's in England at the moment, of course, shooting the new Star Wars film; he broke his left leg on set last month – but Ben says the two were never estranged.

'My father was definitely around when I was growing up. He was a constant, and he likes to cook too. I gave him a copy of my book for Father's Day, so I hope he's cracked it open and is experimenting for summer, but it's difficult for people to enjoy food in Hollywood. I'm a much bigger version of my dad, so I understand what it takes for him to look like he does. I cook all the time. He doesn't.'

Ben grew up wanting to play baseball professionally until a serious knee injury put paid to his dreams and he switched careers at a time when chefs thrived on a culture of aggression in the kitchen.

'It was hard at first,' he says. 'I had a couple of instances where I had to work for tough, belligerent chefs. It's fiercely competitive if you're working anywhere worth its salt. It takes a particular kind of muscle, which is something I find a lot of satisfaction in because not everyone can do it. You're on your feet 14, sometimes 16 hours a day, six days a week. It's a lot of sacrifice.'

It certainly takes its toll on the personal life. 'Yes,' he nods wearily. His first marriage to TV news producer Elizabeth Winkler produced a  13-year-old son, Ethan, and he has four-year- old Waylon from his happy second marriage to Emily, who works in his restaurant business.

Growing up with a famous parent can open doors but it can also create a lot of pressure. 'I found it more difficult than rewarding at times,' he admits.

'You want to be one of the guys you're working with, but sometimes that was hard for me. Also there was less trust in my commitment to the profession. People thought, "He doesn't need it as much as the next guy." It has its advantages too. It would be silly to shun the attention. But when I was younger I felt unworthy of that attention.'

Ben says he'll always remember when his father first started making money and they had a fancy holiday in Hawaii.

He saw a whole pig being cooked on the beach and it was a pivotal moment for him. A whole roasted pig is now one of his signature dishes.

He got his passion for roasting when he came to visit his father shooting Raiders Of The Lost Ark at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire.

'They were shooting so many films there at that time. Wandering around the sets would be fun, there was James Bond and Pink Panther. At weekends we always seemed to go to someone's home, never to a restaurant, for a Sunday roast. I watched everything.'

Ben was one of the first to offer whole-animal cuisine – now in vogue – at his first restaurant back in 1999.

He was also one of the first restaurateurs to employ foragers, who gather wild ingredients from hedgerows and woods, which is ultra-chic in LA right now.

But none of it would have happened, he says, without his mother's cooking. 'When I was growing up my mum would make a simple roast chicken but it was the best I've ever had. I still can't reproduce it after 28 years of trying. She still makes the roast chicken,' he says sadly. 'She has MS and it's progressive.'

At times it's seemed as though the nurturing force of his mother's chicken has got the family through her health crisis.

'Food is more of a nurturing force in my mother's house than in my father's. My mum is a very special person. She and my father are still friends. That she was able to stay friends for her children says how special she is.'

I get the impression that however competitive Ben is, he doesn't ever want to make a roast chicken better than his mother's.
