Gareth Bale is talking about positioning. More specifically, about getting into better positions more often to score more goals.

It is a part of his game he would like to improve and what, you might ask, is so unusual about that when this is a player already reflecting on so many goals for Real Madrid?

Well it’s the fact that this is the same player managers once regarded as a left back. A player, it is worth reminding ourselves, who once had to battle with Benoit Assou-Ekotto for a place in the  Tottenham team.

Harry Redknapp saw the value in pushing him further forward,  eventually deploying him on the left wing and unleashing a talent that took the Champions League by storm.

The 24-year-old is now ready to play in a European Cup final on Saturday, when Carlo Ancelotti’s side face Atletico Madrid in Lisbon.

Since arriving in Spain he has been christened ‘The Cannon’, and it is a nickname that captures the sometimes spectacular nature of his goals.

But to this observer none has been more spectacular than his 20th of the season; the goal that secured the Copa del Rey against Barcelona.

We knew Bale was quick. But it is hard to recall a more impressive demonstration of pure pace on any pitch than the burst he mustered to take him past Marc Bartra after the Barca defender had knocked him into touch.

That goal is seen as the defining moment of Bale’s first season abroad.

‘I scored a similar goal for Wales maybe six weeks beforehand,’ said Bale, who was speaking at an EA Sports 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil event. ‘I was just focused on the ball but if I am in a sprint with someone I fancy myself. It was great to score the goal. It was important to win the first trophy of the season. It gave us a lot of confidence.’

It is a quiet confidence that appears to be at the root of Bale’s success. A confidence that has  enabled him to take the move to Madrid in his stride.

When he arrived, much was made of how he might operate alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. Whether the  finest player in English football could exist in harmony with the  finest player in the world.

But Bale credits Ronaldo with being a reason why his has been such a smooth transition.

‘Cristiano has been very supportive,’ said Bale. ‘From the first day I came in, he has been there for me. On day one he gave me advice on the best areas to live and stuff like that.

‘We talk a lot; have a good  relationship on and off the pitch. I’ve learned a bit of everything from him. The way he plays and gets himself into certain positions; it’s a chance to learn off one of the best players in the world. Hopefully, that will improve me as a player.’

It is at this juncture that he mentions that area where he feels he needs to improve — scoring goals.

‘I don’t think there’s anything specific,’ he said. ‘It is more my all-round game, positioning-wise. I need to get myself into more goal-scoring positions.

‘Every year I try to keep improving and I tell myself that if I keep working hard I will get better.’

To be part of the team that wins La Decima — Madrid’s 10th European Cup — would be special. ‘It would be a dream to win it,’ said Bale.

Nothing makes a footballer feel more settled than success on the field. As Bale said: ‘The time was right to go to Madrid. I am really glad I did it. I am trying to embrace everything, trying to enjoy the ride. It was also important to not only have some friends over but some family as well. I have got a great team around me.

‘I always had confidence in my ability and the fact we are now chasing the 10th title, against our city rivals, is very exciting.

‘Madrid has a real buzz about it. It’s football mad at the best of times but there’s a real sense of anticipation.’
