Despite the absence of star striker Radamel Falcao, Colombia made a fantastic start to their World Cup campaign as Napoli full-back Pablo Armero gave them the lead in the fifth minute against Greece.

Armeroâ€™s scuffed shot was not the finest finish we have seen in the opening three days, but his dance in front of the Colombia bench was certainly the best celebration so far.

His brilliantly choreographed moves in front of his team-mates and coach had the Colombia fans in Belo Horizonte replicating his dance in the stands.

Repeat: The celebration had been done by Armero before for Adidas

The 27-year-old has a history of flamboyant celebrations, despite not 
getting a chance to show them off during his goalless six-month loan spell with 
West Ham at the end of last season.

It
 appears Armeroâ€™s celebration was part of a campaign by Colombia 
sponsors Adidas.

They posted a video of the defender in a studio doing 
the same dance on their YouTube channel as soon as his goal went in 
against Greece.

Bebeto rocking the baby

The former Brazil striker ran off after scoring against Holland at USA 1994 and put his arms in front of his body and swayed them from side to side as if cradling a baby.

The birth of his son, Mattheus Oliveira, inspired the improvised celebration, which turned Bebeto from a relatively unknown member of Brazil's 1994 squad into an instantly recognisable face on the world stage.

Roger Milla dancing with the corner flag

The 38-year-old was one of the stars of the 1990 tournament in Italy, celebrating each of his four goals by swaying his hips while dancing with the corner flag.

Two of his goals came against Colombia in the last 16, the celebrations from which inspired a Coca-Cola advert at the 2010 World Cup.

Papa Bouba Diop dancing around his shirt

The midfielder scored the only goal in the opening game of the 2002 World Cup as Senegal stunned the reigning champions France.

Diop ran towards the corner flag in celebration, whipped off his shirt, and then proceeded to dance around it with his ecstatic teammates.
