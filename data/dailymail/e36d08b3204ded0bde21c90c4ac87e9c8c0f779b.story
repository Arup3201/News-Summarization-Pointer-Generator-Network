Kevin Nugent has been placed in caretaker charge of Leyton Orient following Russell Slade's resignation, the Sky Bet League One club has announced.

Slade quit Brisbane Road on Wednesday night having been denied permission to speak to Cardiff about their vacant managerial position.

His departure came after an tumultuous couple of weeks at the east London club, during which Slade was told by Orient's new owners that he had one game to save his job following their poor start to the season.

The 53-year-old survived the 1-1 draw with Notts County and then oversaw a 2-1 win at Scunthorpe and Tuesday night's Capital One Cup defeat by Sheffield United despite growing speculation linking him with the Bluebirds.

Slade is now expected to be confirmed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's successor at Cardiff, although Orient are consulting their lawyers over his resignation.

He was the fourth-longest serving manager in the top four divisions, having taken over in April 2010, and guided Orient to the League One play-off final last season.

A statement published on Orient's website confirmed that Nugent, who was Slade's number two, will take charge of the home game against Rochdale on Saturday assisted by coaches Andy Edwards and Kevin Dearden.

Meanwhile former O's chairman Barry Hearn, who sold the club to Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti in July, wrote on Twitter: "It's the end of the Slade era. Thanks Russ for the best 4 years I had in football and good luck for the future.
