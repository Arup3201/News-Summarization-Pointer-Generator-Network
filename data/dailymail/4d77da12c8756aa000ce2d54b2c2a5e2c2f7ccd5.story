Tragic end: Damon Janes, a 16-year-old junior running back at Brocton Central School died Monday after losing consciousness from a helmet-to-helmet hit in a game Friday night

A high school football player from Western New York has died after suffering a blow to the head during a game last week.

Damon Janes, 16, passed away from his injuries Monday night at Women & Children's Hospital in Buffalo.

Janes was a running back on the Westfield/Brocton football team and lost consciousness after a helmet-to-helmet collision during a game against Portville Friday. He was a junior at Brocton Central School.

The teen’s official cause of death has yet to be determined.

Damon’s grieving parents released a statement expressing their ‘gratitude to those who have supported and prayed for Damon and his family.’

Janes’ passing has come a shock to the local community, where friends and strangers alike had spent three days praying and holding vigils in the hope that the 16-year-old would pull through.

Ken Stoldt, chairman of the Section VI Football Federation, told Buffalo News the local football community is ‘deeply saddened’ by Damon’s death

Tragedy struck Friday while Janes was playing for Brocton/Westfield against Portville.

In the third quarter, the junior received a hard hit to the head and was able to walk off the field on his own, but collapsed on the sidelines.

He was rushed to Olean General Hospital before being transported to the medical center in Buffalo, where he died three days later without ever regaining consciousness.

After learning of Janes' untimely passing, students in Brocton, Westfield and Portville donned school colors Monday in honor of the 16-year-old.

All sporting and homecoming events have been canceled at Brocton Central School this week in the wake of the tragedy, and grief councilors have been brought in to help students and staff deal with their loss. 

Twitter lit up with hundreds of messages of support and grief for the boy with the hashtag #PrayFor Damon. Even Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, weighed in on the tragedy, tweeting: ‘Praying for Damon and the entire Brocton community from DC today,’ Jamestown Post Journal reported.

Fairburn, Georgia, passed away after fracturing a vertebrae in his spine
 during a football game.

The high school football community in the Western New York region also has been touched by tragedy in recent years.

In October 2011, 16-year-old Ridge Barden, of John C. Birdlebough High School in Phoenix, died after sustaining a head injury during a football game against Homer.

According to the Annual Survey of Football Injury Research prepared by the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina, there were 25 fatal injuries to high school football players in the U.S. between 2003 and 2013.

Deadspin reported that over the same time period, 78 players suffered irreversible brain damage, and 71 received ‘catastrophic’ cervical injuries.
