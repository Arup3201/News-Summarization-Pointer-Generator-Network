Britain could give convicts life bans which prevent them from voting even after they have left prison.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling published a draft bill containing three options for resolving the UK’s long-running stand-off with Strasbourg over granting prisoners the vote.

These were giving votes to inmates who have been imprisoned for up to four years, for up to six months or, crucially, maintaining the UK’s existing blanket ban.

Offenders imprisoned for five years or more could lose their votes forever, if a new system were to be brought in

He is establishing a joint committee of MPs and Peers to scrutinise each of the proposals - a move which could boot the issue into the long grass until 2014.

However, Mr Grayling said he also wanted the committee to consider other ideas, including the system operated by the Italian government, which has been ruled lawful by the European Court of Human Rights.

Under this regime, prisoners given shorter sentences are entitled to vote while behind bars.

But anyone sentenced to five years or more - such as rapists and killers - are stripped of their right to vote forever, subject to a right of appeal.

It would mean MPs swallowing the idea of 
thousands of convicts voting by post while in jail, in return for far 
tougher treatment of Britain’s worst criminals upon release.

Dominic Grieve, Attorney General, has warned Britain could become a ¿pariah¿

Currently, ex-offenders are free to take part in elections as soon as they are released.

In a Commons statement, Mr Grayling said: ‘The Italian system, found to be compliant by the Court, disenfranchises prisoners post-release. The Committee will I am sure consider evidence on this and other approaches.’

The British government had been given until today by Strasbourg - dubbed a ‘Mickey Mouse court by MPs yesterday - to respond to a 2005 ruling that it is unlawful to ban all convicted prisoners from voting.

MPs - led by the Prime Minister, who said prisoner voting made him feel ‘physically ill - have repeatedly made it clear they want to defy the court and keep the blanket ban in place.

Mr Grayling is hoping to end the stand-off - or at least buy more time - by giving MPs a fresh vote on what happens next.

But Nick Herbert, the former policing minister, said Britain should withdraw from membership of the European court, as it is ‘doubtful that any of the three main options presented to Parliament will actually be acceptable to Strasbourg.

He predicted that the ECHR would start awarding prisoners compensation, and the public would find that even harder to ‘stomach’.

Thousands of prisoners are lining-up to claim compensation, worth £1,000 each, if Strasbourg rules it is not satisfied with Britain’s response.

Mr Grayling suggested he could block prisoners getting access to legal aid to help them mount their legal challenges.

However MPs fear that will not prove a deterrent to ‘ambulance chasing’ lawyers who are prepared to offer their services on a no-win, no-fee basis.

Labour said it did not want any inmates to have the vote.

But Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat peer and prominent barrister, said the UK must be seen to comply with the law.

He claimed: ‘This diminishes our reputation across the world, whether in Beijing or Moscow, and makes me feel sick.’

Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, has himself warned Britain could become a ‘pariah’ if it does not obey Strasbourg.

But Mr Grayling hit back: ‘Some people have suggested that if Parliament chooses to exercise its right of sovereignty the United Kingdom will become a pariah state. I simply do not accept that.

‘I believe that Parliament has the right to exercise its sovereignty, it will be for Parliament to decide in this situation whether it wishes to exercise that sovereignty.

‘But I do not believe that if it chooses to do so somehow Britain will turn into a nation with an appalling human rights record. Our human rights record stands comparison with anyone.’

Mr Grayling said it would be up to MPs whether to pay any compensation ordered by Europe.

Tory MPs made stinging attacks upon the court for meddling in Britain’s affairs.

Robert Halfon said the European Convention on Human Rights was drafted to ensure that the horrors of Nazi Germany could not be repeated.

He added: ‘It was never the intention of the framers to give Albert Speer and Rudolf Hess the vote.’

Fellow backbencher Peter Bone applauded Mr Grayling for seeking to make ‘this Parliament sovereign and ignoring a Mickey Mouse court in Europe.’

However, the Council of Europe’s Human Rights Commissioner made it clear the court was in no mood to tolerate further delays.

Nils Muiznieks said: ‘It’s been seven years since the initial judgment, so a long time has passed since the ruling and the Government has asked for extensions, so we would like to see the judgment implemented.

‘The UK decided to delegate some small part of its sovereignty to the Council of Europe when it joined and when it agreed to abide by the rulings of the court.’

The committee is expected to begin examining the options next year - a process that could take a year or more.

When MPs finally get a vote, Cabinet ministers have been told to abstain by Mr Grieve, who does not want to further infuriate Strasbourg.
