A £3million mews house that was nearing the end of an 18-month refurbishment has been destroyed by a huge fire.

The newly-renovated Grade II-listed Victorian terrace property in the exclusive Hyde Park Garden Mews, central London, set alight in the basement at 4pm yesterday afternoon.

The home was owned by Joan El Husseiny, the wife of a 
Middle Eastern financier - who raised the alarm after smelling smoke when
 she was inspecting work to the property, and it was soon fully alight.

Up in smoke: The basement, ground and first floors of the Grade II-listed Victorian terrace were fully alight

Fire engines on the scene: Neighbours were evacuated and two were treated for smoke inhalation

Getting close: Firefighters used an aerial ladder platform - like a cherry picker - to tackle the fire from above

Difficult to get access: Part of the floor between the first and ground floors of the property collapsed

The basement, 
ground and first floors of the home were ablaze at one point - and part of the 
floor between the first and ground floors collapsed, reported the London Evening 
Standard.

Eight fire engines and 58 firefighters
 and officers went to the road - where properties are worth an average 
of £2.4million - which is next to Hyde Park and close to Lancaster Gate 
Underground station.

Firefighters
 used an aerial ladder platform - similar to a cherry picker - to tackle
 the fire from above, and there were no reports of injuries. The cause 
of the fire was today under investigation.

A
 London Fire Service spokesman said the complex layout of the 
three-storey, three-bedroom house meant that deep seated pockets of fire
 were difficult for crews to access.

Exclusive area: The London road is next to Hyde Park and close to Lancaster Gate Underground station

Fire: The newly-renovated home was destroyed on a road with an average house price of £2.4million in London

Response: The London Fire Service said the blaze began in the property's basement just after 4pm yesterday

Danger: The basement, ground and first floors were fully alight when the fire was at its most fierce

Fire
 engines from Kensington, Paddington, Euston, North Kensington, 
Hammersmith, Soho and West Hampstead were at the scene on the road, 
where properties are worth an average of £2.4million.

Station
 manager John Ryan said at the time: ‘It looks like the fire started in the 
basement. Crews are working very hard to bring the fire under control. 
We don't believe anyone is involved at this stage.’

Neighbour
 Eric Butterfield told the Standard: ‘The owner was locking up the house
 to go home when she smelt smoke. I think she put the gas fire on for a 
couple of hours.

‘But she 
doesn’t know how the fire started. The house is not finished yet and it 
has had work on it for over a year including a new basement. There were 
tradespeople in there today.’

Gutted: Severe damage was caused to the ground floor level of the building on Hyde Park Gardens Mews

On the scene: A firefighter stands outside the building in daylight. There have been no reports of injuries

Smoke remains: The Grade II-listed building was gutted by a fire that started in the basement

Before the blaze: Eight fire engines attended the incident. The street pictured in this photo is Hyde Park Gardens, which backs onto Hyde Park Gardens Mews. The fire was tackled from both roads

Neighbours
 were evacuated and two were treated for smoke inhalation. One man was 
treated for leg injuries by paramedics while the fire was contained.  
Nobody had been living in the house.

Estate
 agent Antoine Lurot, of Lurot Brand which handled the sale, told the 
Standard: ‘They have completely refurbished it and now it’s gone, the 
poor woman.’

Celebrity chef
 Heston Blumenthal, 47, once lived in a house on the road backing onto
 Hyde Park Gardens Mews - called Hyde Park Gardens - with his parents Celia and Stephen and sister 
Alexis.

Photographs and reports revealed the fire was tackled from both Hyde Park Gardens and the mews.
