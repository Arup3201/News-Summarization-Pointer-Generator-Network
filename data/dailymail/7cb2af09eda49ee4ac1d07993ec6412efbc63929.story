Georgia Eden was kicked out of the Miss England competition after posting this picture online

A model has been kicked out of the Miss England competition because she posted a topless picture of herself online to promote a breast cancer campaign. 

Georgia Eden was told on Friday she could not take part in the Miss Oxfordshire heat of the competition after it was discovered she had posted a 'selfie' of herself to promote the fight against breast cancer.

However, the 22-year-old professional model was told by organisers that the image contravened the rules because it brought the event into disrepute. 

Miss Eden challenged the ruling saying she tweeted the image twice in March with the hashtags #coppafeel and #breastcancerawareness after losing a close friend to the disease last year.

Coppafeel is a campaign that promotes the for women to regularly check their breasts for signs of cancer.

She said she had been asked to support the cause by her London modelling agency Mode, with who she has a strictly 'no-topless' contract.

In the photograph she covers her breasts with one of her hands and her arm.

Miss Eden said that she felt 'demeaned' by the ruling.

'I am quite upset by the accusation levelled against me because it is not true. 

'I have been made to feel cheap. The photo is implied topless - but there are no nipples on show,' said Miss Eden, who lives in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.

'This is my career, I wouldn't have posted the photo if I thought there was anything wrong with it. I have never posted a topless image. I have never even gone topless on a beach.'

However, organiser Beverley O'Neill, said she believed Miss Eden's pictures showed she was 'not suitable' for Miss Oxfordshire.

On Wednesday, Ms O'Neill emailed Miss Eden, saying: 'It has been brought to the attention of Miss England that you have previously posted semi-naked photographs on social media. 

'This contravenes rule 3, do not bring the Miss England contest or its sponsors into disrepute.

'As a result I regret to inform you that we will be unable to accept your further participation in the event.'

Mrs O'Neill said today: 'This woman has got her boobies all over the place.

'She is all over social media with these pictures of herself... she wants to be a glamour model she is into all that stuff, Loaded and I don't even know what. It is worlds apart from our contest.

'She may have made a mistake but you can't be in a beauty pageant and a page three model, they are completely different worlds.

'The Miss England representative has to be someone of a certain calibre and she is not suitable.'

Miss England area organiser Diane Slater said she believed there had been full frontal images but could not provide evidence of this. Miss Eden denied this completely.

Ms Slater added that even Miss Eden's 'selfie' image was enough though to contravene competition rules.

In the past weeks, Miss Eden and other contestants had their photos on the Miss Oxfordshire website and the public was invited to pay £1 pound each to vote for the girls.

Miss Eden said she had 52 votes.

Boyfriend Kieran Cochrane, aged 22 years, an Abingdon United footballer, said: 'One-hundred per cent, this doesn't make sense. She took this photo herself, to help a charity.

'She is a beautiful girl and was doing really well as a model, so when this happened she was really annoyed and upset.'
