Just a few days ago she was tearfully recalling how she 'fell in love' with her boss President Clinton - and, she claimed, unwittingly became the first person to have their reputation torn to shreds online.

But the former White House intern, 41, whose romantic entanglement with Bill Clinton shocked the world, looked carefree when she touched down at in New York yesterday.

Dressed in a black cardigan and pants combo with a grey shirt underneath, the controversial figure smiled as she walked out of the departures gate at JFK airport.

Touching down: Lewinsky smiled as she strolled through the terminal at New York's JFK airport

She smiles as she walked through the terminal, dragging a small suitcase and carrying a white canvas bag and $1,400 Goyard tote bag over her shoulder.

She donned sunglasses to step out into the bright New York sun as she waited for her pick-up outside.

Lewinsky has recently plunged herself into the limelight again by speaking out about her dalliances with the former President, which led to a national uproar and Clinton's impeachment.

Reinvention: Lewinsky, 41, is reinventing herself as a social activist who will fight cyber-bullying - of which she claims to be the first victim

She was the star speaker at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia last week, where she picked over the explosive revelations of 1998 again, and cast herself as 'patient zero' in an epidemic of cyber-bullying.

Addressing the crowd from a podium, she said: ‘Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss.

She continued: 'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one.

'I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet. 

'I fell in love with my boss': Lewinsky spoke out over her affair for the first time at a Forbes summit last week 

‘I lost my public self, or had it stolen... In a way, it was a form of identity theft... Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up.

'Yet around the world this story went - A viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly "social" media,' she recalled, according to Forbes.

The speech marked the start of Lewinksy's drive to shift her public image from being the butt of countless jokes to a social activist, fighting against bullying.

She used the Forbes event - and her much-commented-on Twitter debut the same day - to stoke the fires of her planned 'cultural revolution' over cyber-bullying.

However, though her ambition to become a public figure once again was praised by many, some derided her attempts to spin an affair with a married politician for PR points as cynical.
