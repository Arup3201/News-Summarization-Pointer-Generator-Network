A necklace worth at least 1.7 million pounds and due to be worn by Hollywood beauties like Cameron Diaz has been stolen at the Cannes Film Festival.

The mystery theft is the second to blight the glamorous French Riviera showbusiness spectacular inside a week.

It happened at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, where the cheapest rooms cost more than 800 pounds a night.

Stars including Sharon Stone and Ornella Muti were enjoying a lavish party in the hotel, which is a few miles along the coast from Cannes in Cap d'Antibes, when the thieves struck on Tuesday night.

The necklace, by Swiss jeweller De Grisogono and with a list price of 1.7 million pounds, vanished despite 80 security guards being in the building. Its link to the movie world will also add to its value on the black market.

The jeweller house, which was celebrating its anniversary, regularly loans its pieces to celebrities including Miss Diaz and socialite Paris Hilton.

'It is actually the first time it has happened in our 20-year history,' reads a company statement, adding that the theft happened 'despite the large security measures set in place: over 80 security guards plus police'.

Lost jewels: Fawaz Gruosi, pictures at the party with Sharon Stone and model Alessandra Ambrosio, said the £1.7m necklace was one of De Grisogono's 'most beautiful items'

‘We don't know exactly what happened, it 
was one of the most beautiful items we had,’ founder Fawaz Gruosi said. 
‘The police are trying to figure out what happened.’

Last Friday jewellery worth around £1m was taken from an uninsured room safe in the Cannes Novotel.

An
American woman working for the Swiss jewellery house Chopard was said 
to have been enjoying a champagne-fuelled night out on the town when a 
thief struck.

Chopard has 
40 staff at Cannes whose job it is to persuade stars like Julianne 
Moore, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne to wear their pieces. Nobody 
has yet been arrested in connection with the crime.

French
police also reported today that at least two flats being rented by film
executives at this year's festival have been burgled.

Cannes is notorious for jewellery thefts, with organised gangs frequently targeting boutiques and hotels, especially during parties, and when stars are on the red carpet.

Many turn of the raids turn out to be inside jobs, with staff helping the thieves to locate and then steal items.

Today detectives were inspecting the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc for clues. It is such an exclusive hotel that it only accepts cash payments.

Guests who regularly stayed there during the Cannes Film Festival have included Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

This year's festival is the 66nd, and actors attending include Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan and Ameesha Patel.
