Traveller families who were living illegally on the Dale Farm site have been warned they will be charged £80,000 each to cover the cost of their eviction.

Basildon Council will demand the families living on the 52 plots pay just over £4million between them.

The families were removed from the six-acre site near Crays Hill, Essex, after a 10-year planning row.

A council source said it would be likely to seek ownership of the land as there is little chance of the traveller families producing the money.

'There is more chance of getting blood from a stone than the travellers handing over money for being thrown off their land,' he said.

'I think realistically, what we will see is the council will take ownership of the land and it will become a council asset.

'The final use of the site has not been decided but there has been talk of it becoming allotments.'

Council leader Tony Ball said: 'Some travellers will pay more than others, as there were buildings which had to be removed, requiring more work to do.'

The £4million cost was just half of the £8million bill expected if activists had dug their heels in and held out against the bailiffs for months in the 'Battle of Basildon'.

As it turned out, travellers who had pledged to 'fight to the death' walked away from the former scrapyard just two days after the eviction began in October.

Essex Police has yet to finalise the costs of the eviction but it is anticipated they too will come in well under the budget of £10million.

The Dale Farm site remains blocked off and any families moving back onto the land have been warned they could be arrested.

Last month dozens of caravans returned to the site, sparking fears that the council could be left facing another long battle to remove them.

But many of the families are now living on plots on the legal part of the Dale Farm site - just 200 yards from where they were evicted.

Others in touring caravans are still parked up on the roadway leading to the site.

Former Dale Farm resident Mary McCarthy, 42, a mother-of-three, said: 'People have nowhere to turn to. This is home for them, Basildon is home. Essex is home so that is why we are still here.

'It is getting cold now and people are starting to suffer and that is why the families did not want to return to a life on the road.

'We have kids, it's not a life for them in these conditions.'
