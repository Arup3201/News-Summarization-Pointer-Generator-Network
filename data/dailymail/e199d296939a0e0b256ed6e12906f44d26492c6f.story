Two fire chiefs and two poultry farm bosses have been convicted and sentenced to prison terms of up to nine years for a fire at a plant in northeastern China last year that killed 121 people.

The June 2013 fire in Jilin province was China's deadliest industrial accident in five years and highlighted continuing violations of safety regulations despite recent improvements in the country's work safety record.

Survivors at the time described workers, mostly women, struggling through smoke and flames in the poultry processing plant to reach doors that turned out to be locked or blocked after an electrical short ignited flammable goods.

About 100 workers managed to escape the deadly smoke and flames. Those who survived said all the lights went out, the plant went dark and people started to panic

On Friday, two district courts in Changchun city sentenced two bosses of the plant and two fire officials, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

The chairman of Jilin Baoyuanfeng Poultry Company, Jia Yushan, was sentenced to nine years in prison and fined 1 million yuan (Â£102,000) for not ensuring the working environment was safe, and former general manager Zhang Yushen was sentenced to four years for installing substandard equipment, Xinhua said.

Lyu Yandong, the former chief of the local fire department, and his deputy Liu Guicai were convicted of abuse of power and sentenced to prison terms of up to 5 and a half years.

Prosecutors previously said they had failed to carry out any serious inspections of the plant and falsified information after the fire to try and cover that up.

While 121 people were killed in the deadly blaze, another 76 were badly injured.

At the time the company was producing 67,000 tonnes of processed chicken per year and employed about 1,200 people.

The fire at the plant started at around 6am, not far from the town of Dehui (illustrated), about 800 kilometers northeast of China's capital, Beijing

Many survivors reported scenes of panic in the immediate aftermath of the incident. Alarmingly, there were numerous reports of survivors saying they struggled to get out of the building because exits were 'blocked'.

They said because of the 'complicated' design of the building, including narrow corridors, blocked exits and lights cutting out, many were unable to escape.

Reports at the time claimed workers heard a loud explosion and then dark smoke and flames quickly engulfed the factory.

Speaking to Chinese state media CCTV, one woman said: 'I heard a huge blast, I thought it was an earthquake, everyone started running. I fell and and had to crawl out of the building.'

Another escaped by climbing out of the window.

She said: 'A huge cloud of black smoke came down the corridor. It was burning hot; it engulfed me.'

She collapsed unconscious as soon as she was outside.

Wang Fenya, a 44-year-old female worker said: 'Soon after (the fire started) someone shouted "run away!" and we quickly ran to the exit, which is about 40metres away from my seat. Suddenly the lights went out and the plant got quite dark.'

She said when she finally got outside and looked back, she could see big flames coming out of the building.
