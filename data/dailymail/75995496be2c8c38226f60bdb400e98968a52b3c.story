A wealthy entrepreneur and member of one of Britain’s best known families was stabbed to death by a screaming attacker armed with a pair of scissors.

James Fiennes – second cousin of Arctic explorer Sir Ranulph – was having a drink in an upmarket tapas restaurant when the man went ‘out of his mind’ and repeatedly plunged the blades into his body.

As the assailant was tackled by a former police officer, the 49-year-old victim collapsed to the floor.

He underwent emergency surgery in hospital but died five hours later.

A man who was stabbed to death at an upmarket tapas restaurant was the relative of actor Ralph Fiennes (right) and explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes (left), it emerged today

Last night, Sir Ranulph was said to be
 in deep shock as he flew back from the US. The victim, a father of two 
whose full name was James Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, was a more distant 
cousin of  actor brothers Ralph and Joseph.

Nicholas Hunter, 36, was remanded in custody today after he appeared in court charged with murder

His murder took place at The Tapestry restaurant in Mortlake, south west London on Tuesday.

Marlborough
 College-educated Mr Fiennes, whose family live near Sherborne in 
Dorset, was a regular customer and stayed at a nearby flat while working
 in London.

The businessman
 was drinking with colleagues at about 9pm when he was confronted by a 
man who arrived at the restaurant on a bicycle. Jackson Fiorini, who has
 managed the bar for 14 years and known Mr Fiennes for five, said: ‘The 
attacker came in and just stabbed him, he didn’t even buy a drink.

‘James hadn’t even had time to finish his beer, it was completely out of the blue.

‘James
 went to the loo, he came back and this guy attacked him. He went out of
 his mind. My niece heard what was happening and ran to tell him to 
stop. The guy was screaming like an animal.’

Mr
 Fiorini said that as his niece dialled 999, another customer – who once
 served as a police officer – stepped in and persuaded the attacker to 
drop the scissors, before immobilising him.

He
 said the assailant was yelling ‘kill me before the police come’, 
adding: ‘He was trying to get at James even as we were holding him down.
 It took about five people to hold him until the police came.’

The
 son of the former Dean of Lincoln, Mr Fiennes owned several businesses 
including an IT consultancy and a company selling imported French soap.

James Fiennes, 49, was stabbed at The Tapestry tapas bar in Mortlake, south west London, on Tuesday evening

Last
 night, his widow Caroline was being comforted by relatives at their 
farm in Bishop’s Caundle. They have two children, Georgina, 16, and 
Hector, 13.

His brother, 
property developer Adam Fiennes, 52, said the victim was a ‘very 
dedicated family man’. He added that the tragedy has ‘had a huge impact 
on us’.

Neighbour Sarah 
Dean, 52, said: ‘He was such a lovely man and he had two little children
 as well. I only saw him last week to give him an invitation to my 
daughter’s wedding. It’s awful news – they are very private people and 
we only ever used to meet them when we were out walking the dogs.  It’s a
 close-knit community and they are close friends of the Digbys, who own 
the estate in Bishop’s Caundle.’

A
 Metropolitan Police spokesman said a 36-year-old man was arrested at 
the scene and appeared before magistrates yesterday accused  of murder. 
Businessman Nicholas Hunter, of Clapham in south west London, is also 
accused of threatening to kill a second customer, who suffered minor 
injuries.
