State and local authorities are now investigating the death of John P. Gleeson Jr. who's family claims he begged for medical attention as an inmate at the Nassau County Jail but was ignored until it was too late.

The Nassau County corrections investigator Capt. Michael Golio told reporters the death of Gleeson Jr., 40, is now under investigation by the New York State Commission of Corrections, the Nassau County Police Department, and the jail's health care providers.

'The death of Mr. Gleeson is under investigation by numerous 
agencies,' Golio said. 'The Sheriff’s Department is 
cooperating and assisting with these investigations.'

The Post reports the Gleeson family attorney James Pascarella is also leading his own independent investigation.

'He was in a Nassau County correctional facility,' Pascarella told the paper. 'Any way you want to slice it, it’s their responsibility to 
keep him safe. It’s their responsibility to take care of any health 
issues he has. It appears that wasn’t done here and that’s 
unacceptable.'

Should an investigation show that the jail staff's action were criminal, Pascarella has promised to push for a prosecution.

'We’re doing our own investigation and, absolutely, if there’s 
potential criminality, we will contact the DA’s office,' Pascarella said. 'We 
want to make sure that, one, this never happens to anyone again, and 
two, that John’s memory is preserved and that justice prevails here.'

While Nassau County DA Kathleen Rice does is looking into the death, her office has not officially opened an investigation.

On July 14, the Gleeson Jr. told the jail's guards he was experiencing pain and swelling from his hands to his chest and neck.

He told them that he had a medical condition and that such swelling showed it had reached life-threatening levels.

After hours went by without treatment, Gleeson passed out and was rushed to Nassau County Medical Center.

He was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Family say Gleeson Jr. told prison guards that he had a medical condition and that such swelling showed it had reached life-threatening levels but was ignored

Gleeson Jr. was jailed on 
May 22 after being charged with petit larceny for stealing a manhole 
cover from an Oceanside parking lot.

His father, John Gleeson Sr., told Mail Online he refused to bail him out because he wanted to teach his son a lesson by leaving him in a Long Island jail.

But 
 weeks later the retired FDNY captain received the devastating phone 
call that John Gleeson Jr. had died while incarcerated.

'I didn’t bail him out,' Gleeson Sr. said. 'I said, ‘Let him get his act together.'

'He was down on his luck, trying to get scrap metal from abandoned 
buildings, whatever he could get his hands on,' his father told The Post.

Repentant: Gleeson Jr., pictured here with his children, had struggled with opiates in the past but was described as 'contrite' and ready to move forward with his life by family members

His family received the news when a correction officer called their home and reached Gleeson's mother, Margaret.

Gleeson Sr. recounted the phone call: 'Are you John Gleeson’s mother?' 'Yes.' 'Well, he expired.'

'My wife started to scream and he [the man on the phone] said, ‘You 
want more information, call the Nassau County Medical Center,’ and he 
hung up,' Gleeson Sr. said.

The Nassau County Sheriff’s Department has not responded to requests for comment.

According to a family friend who works at the jail, the last hours of Gleeson's life were filled with terrible pain that went entirely ignored.

'They give him a Benadryl,' his outraged father told Mail Online. 'Then that doesn't work, an hour later they give him another Benadryl. He's sitting there in pain. I don't care what you did, you deserve to be treated like a human being.'

The family knew something was off when Gleeson Jr. did not call home at his normal 6:30 p.m. time, but it would be hours before they had any idea how bad the situation was.

Jailed: Gleeson's father, John Gleeson Sr., said he refused to bail his son, pictured, out of jail because he thought he needed tough love

Gleeson Sr. said that despite the fact his son was unable to speak he was not removed from his cell and taken to the hospital until 10:30 p.m. He was declared dead half-an-hour later.

Gleeson Sr. told Mail Online that over the course of his son's month-and-a-half incarceration, the tough love seemed to be working.

'He was clean and sober,' he said. 'He missed his kids. He was contrite, talking about how he wanted to put his life together.

'It's beyond obscene.'

Gleeson Jr. left behind a son John, 10, and a daughter Erin, 12.

He had previously been arrested for forging an oxycodone prescription and had struggled with opiate addiction.
