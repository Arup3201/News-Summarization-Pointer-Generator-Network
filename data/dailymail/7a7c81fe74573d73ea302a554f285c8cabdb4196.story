Vicars will be able to swap their cassocks for jeans, T-shirts and even shellsuits at services, weddings and funerals after the Church of England approved the radical ‘makeover’ last night.

Rules requiring clergy to don traditional vestments were swept aside by a vote at the General Synod, the Church’s ‘Parliament’, as part of efforts to make services more relevant to modern congregations.

The Church will now draw up rules to permit clergy to wear what they deem appropriate for services, as long as they have the permission of their bishop.

Some vicars have already indicated 
they will adopt a ‘dress-down’ approach, which critics say opens up the 
prospect of seeing shellsuits in the pulpit.

The
 Synod, meeting in York, passed the proposals after London vicar 
Christopher Hobbs said: ‘There are some contexts where robes should be 
worn, and some contexts where robes may not help in conveying the things
 we want them to convey.’

Today
 the Archbishop of Canterbury warned against becoming 'too hysterical' 
over Islamic radicalisation in Britain as he spoke of his concerns about
 developing a 'culture of fear' towards Muslims.

The
 Most Rev Justin Welby said there was a problem with radicalisation of 
Muslims in Britain and an 'issue' with young men travelling to Syria and
 returning to the UK 'highly radicalised'.

But, speaking in an interview on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, the Archbishop said the proportion of Muslims in Britain who are radicalised remained 'extraordinarily small'.

He said there was a danger of a 'national culture of fear' over the issue. 'Clearly there is an issue with people going to Syria and coming back highly radicalised. There is a problem with radicalisation,' he said.

'But the proportion of Muslims who are radicalised is extraordinarily small and I'm just edgy about developing a national culture of fear because I don't think that gets us anywhere and I think we're in danger of slipping into a very fearful culture in which we see everyone against us and us against everyone and we're constantly trying to defend ourselves.'

The decision to relax the dress code for vicars came as the Synod prepared to debate the adoption of a 'shorter, clearer' liturgy for use at baptism services.

Members of the General Synod meeting in York will discuss a proposed new service which removes references to rejecting the Devil.

Instead it will require parents and god parents to say that they 'turn away from sin' and 'reject evil'.

The changes are designed to help people attending the services who may not have any previous connection to the Church.

A report for the Church's Liturgical Commission said: 'Clergy frequently find themselves conducting baptisms for "un-churched" families, sometimes at services separate from the main Sunday morning act of worship.

'On these occasions there may be a few people present who have a developed understanding of the Church's language and symbolism.

'For the majority of those attending, the existing provision can seem complex and inaccessible.'
