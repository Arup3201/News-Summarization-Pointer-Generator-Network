One of the saddest examples of the dramatic decline of Detroit and the surrounding area is what remains of the Pontiac Silverdome – the once proud home to the Detroit Lions, but which today is an empty shell left to rot.

In its heyday the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, hosted the Super Bowl, a pope, the NBA finals, Led Zeppelin, Elvis, WrestleMania and dozens of other world-class acts and sporting events.

But that all changed in 2002, when the NFL team moved to Ford Field in Detroit and the Silverdome soon fell into disrepair.

The Silverdome has had an uncertain fate ever since, as the city tried to find use for it - including monster truck rallies, boxing matches and as a drive-in theater - and the population in Pontiac dwindled.

One of the saddest examples of the dramatic decline of Detroit and the surrounding area is what remains of the Pontiac Silverdome – the once proud home to the Detroit Lions, but which today is an empty shell left that's been left to rot

Triple Investment Properties bought the Silverdome in 2009 for $583,000, but plans to turn it into a soccer stadium never materialized

Triple Investment Properties bought the Silverdome in 2009 for $583,000, but plans to turn it into a soccer stadium never materialized.

'They had a half-a-million-dollar soccer field they bought that was put in there as well as paying for maintenance of $1.5 million a year up until the roof caved in,' said Jim Passeno of RJM Auctioneers, who in June organized a nine day auction that raised about $500,000. 

Turf that still featured the Lions' logo from both end zones was auctioned for $1,600 each, while copper wiring proved very popular and raised $500,000. 

Now, what once was one of the premier venues in the world is a tattered, empty reminder of the stadium's memorable past - and of the dismal economy in Michigan.

Last month Michigan's sometimes harsh weather put pay to the final sections of the old stadium's Teflon-covered roof which just dropped to the field. 

Afterwards Ohio-based photographer Johnny Joo visited the abandoned stadium and his photos offer an eerie, empty look at a stadium that once held nearly 100,000 people.

'It's kind of crazy to see how much stuff was left behind, like all the old record of Led Zeppelin’s ticket sales,' he told the Daily News.

He describes standing on the carpet of a restaurant, which is now blanketed in green moss 'almost like it has been abandoned for 20 years.'

Joo, 24, photographs vacant buildings and he has compiled some of his pictures of deserted structures inEmpty Spaces: Photojournalism Through The Rust Belt. The book, which is available in e-book form, will be released in hardcover in 2015.

His next project, From Ohio to Oregon, is part traveling art exhibit, part 'pay-it-forward' adventure with a friend and his work is also available at his website.
