HMRC has provoked fury after saying that people struggling to fill in their tax returns should publicly tweet their questions to get advice.

Figures reveal that more than a third of calls to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs are not answered.

Some desperate callers are spending more than two hours on hold when contacting the jammed helplines to get advice on completing their self-assessment before the deadline at the end of this month.

New figures have shown that 2.4 million calls to the HMRC were not answered in September

The average time customers are left waiting on hold has more than doubled in the past year.

MPs last night called for HMRC bosses to be brought before Parliament to explain themselves after it responded to the dismal waiting times by suggesting those who are unable to get through on the phone try using Twitter instead.

They said it was ‘laughable’ to expect customers to sum up complicated tax questions in 140-character messages or to share them publicly. The latest figures show that 2.4million calls to the HMRC (34.5 per cent) were not answered in September, up from 1.2million calls (20.5 per cent) 12 months before.

The average time callers with queries about tax had to wait has more than doubled in a year, rising to 11 minutes 51 seconds in September, up from 4 minutes 42 seconds a year earlier.

Ten million individuals who self-assess have to submit their returns by January 31 with a £100 penalty for tax returns up to three months late.

An HMRC spokesman last night admitted some customers ‘can struggle to get through on our helplines at very busy times’, but added ‘customers can get help with general self-assessment queries by tweeting us’.

Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour’s exchequer spokesman, said: ‘It beggars belief that the Government’s response to taxpayers who can’t get through on their helpline is to urge them to publicly tweet about their tax affairs.

‘This is an unacceptable level of service to taxpayers and simply isn’t good enough.’ Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, called the tweet suggestion ‘laughable’, adding: ‘No customer based service should tolerate such a poor service and both ministers and senior management should simply sort this out.’

Mark Garnier MP, a member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘Only a small proportion of the country uses Twitter. I cannot think of even a simple tax problem that can be summed up in 140 characters. It is just rubbish, naive, stupid and facile comment.’

Chancellor George Osborne has announced new powers for the HMRC to seize assets of tax dodgers

David Hickson of the Fair Telecoms Campaign said: ‘It is ridiculous and absolutely appalling situation and no surprise that people having to wait more than ten minutes are giving up trying. While tweets may be suited to some types of enquiry, it is unacceptable for telephone enquiry lines not to be adequately staffed.’

The blunder comes at a time when HMRC is requesting new powers to take unpaid taxes directly from taxpayers’ bank accounts.

In the Budget, Chancellor George Osborne announced proposals to allow HMRC to seize assets from anyone who owes more than £1,000 in tax or tax credits, subject to certain safeguards.

HMRC’s helplines have been beset with problems for several years. In November 2013 it introduced a voice-recognition system, which it said would help cut overall call times.

But a Which? survey in December found the automated system is struggling with certain words and phrases.

Last month HMRC scrapped all of its 0845 helpline telephone numbers, which charge premium rates to callers. The numbers have been replaced with alternatives starting 03, charged at a local rate.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We are working hard to improve our handling of customer calls and are moving up to 1,500 extra people on to the phones during January as the self-assessment deadline approaches.

‘HMRC receives around 70million calls a year and we know that some of our customers can struggle to get through on our helplines at very busy times … customers can get help with general self-assessment queries by tweeting us.’
