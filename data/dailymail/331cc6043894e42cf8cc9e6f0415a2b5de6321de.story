A family claims they are allergic to their £900 Argos sofa after erupting in burning itchy rashes as soon as they sit on it.

Lynnette Stuckey, 52, bought a three-piece suite from Argos two months ago but within a couple of weeks she was hit with a rash, which spread across her stomach and back.

Now every member of the family, from Cardiff, has reported the same reaction after sitting on the black and grey 'Bailey' sofa.

Ms Stuckey said: 'It was a big red mark and it felt like a bee sting,' she said. 'I couldn't make out where it was coming from.'

Her daughter Laura said: 'Every person who sits on it gets like a burning sensation on the skin, and it's itchy straight away.

'It comes up into a rash or a lump, and then it becomes a hole and it weeps.'

Laura, 26, said she saw her GP for treatment for the rash but the various prescribed creams didn't make the rash go away.

Her sister and her sister's boyfriend have also since been affected.

Ms Stuckey said: 'It was a big red mark and it felt like a bee sting,' she said. 'I couldn't make out where it was coming from'

The family contacted Argos on November 5 about the issue and claimed that the company first told the family to phone pest control.

Ms Stuckey said: 'Pest control said there was no point coming out to see the sofa because from what I'd told him over the phone it's a chemical reaction from the sofa.

'He said if it was an infestation my mum would see things jumping on the sofa. He said coming out would be a waste of our money.'

Argos then told her they would send an upholstery crew to test the sofa, but the family say they haven't heard from them since.

An Argos spokesman said: 'As a responsible retailer we were extremely concerned to learn of the issues Ms Stuckey and her family have experienced with their chair and sofas. Our priority is conducting an urgent investigation into this matter.

'We have attempted to get in touch with Ms Stuckey to discuss this further, however we are unable to get hold of the customer at this time. 

In 2010, Argos and several other high street retailers agreed to pay out up to £20m in compensation to around 2,000 customers who reported that they had received chemical burns from their leather sofas.

It was found that the sofas were packed with sachets of the anti-mould chemical dimethyl fumarate which were used by some manufacturers to protect leather goods from going mouldy while stored in humid conditions.
