16-year-old Kyle Rees was killed in a tragic accident as he was hit in the head by a cricket ball as it was thrown across the playground

A schoolboy who was killed when he was hit on the head by a cricket ball thrown by his friend told him ‘I’m fine’ before collapsing, an inquest heard today.

Kyle Rees, 16, got in the way of the ball as his friend went to hurl it across the school playground in a boisterous game.

Kyle had urged his friend, who can’t be named for legal reasons, to throw the orange object towards the school IT block.

But the teenager then walked into its path and was hit on the side of the head.

The boy was initially arrested on suspicion of manslaughter but was released without charge, Kyle’s mother, Tanya Cooper, told the inquest that she did not blame the boy who threw the ball.

She said: 'They were really good friends. He is a lovely lad and I feel so bad for him. It must be so hard to have to keep going through it.

'Not for one second have any of us thought he would have done it on purpose. When we found out who had thrown the ball we knew it must have been an accident.'

The mother of the boy told of the effect his friend’s death had had on him. She said: 'He is devastated. He is not in the right place. A big part of him died that day. He can’t forgive himself. He was his friend. He can’t forgive himself.'

The boy, also aged 16, told of his dying friend’s final words before he slumped to the ground unconscious.

He said he grabbed hold of Kyle and asked if he was OK, to which he replied ‘I’m fine, let me sit down’ before stating ‘my head hurts’.

CCTV footage covering the school playground showed Kyle stumble to his feet before collapsing on the floor. He suffered a massive haemorrhage and died in hospital the next day.

The mother of the boy who threw the ball said her son ‘can’t forgive himself’ since the tragedy and that a ‘part of him had died’ when Kyle did.

An inquest today heard that the incident happened during the end of the lunch break at Porchester Boys School in Bournemouth, Dorset, on February 27.

A pupil climbed on to a flat roof building to retrieve several tennis balls that had been previously hit up there, triggering the impromptu throwing game.

After a teacher broke the game up Kyle and two friends discovered a harder ball in the playground.

Detective Sergeant Trevor Hawkins, of Bournemouth police, read out a statement made by the boy in question. He said: 'He (Kyle) told me to pass him the ball but I said no.

'He wanted me to throw him the ball but there were teachers about and I didn’t want him to get into trouble. I have it in my hand and we started to walk. He was on my right side. He said ‘throw it.’

'As I turn to throw it he comes around and is on my right side. I was just throwing it in a bit of space in the middle of the playground.

'He has come round the back of me and I just caught him. I wasn’t quite sure (where the ball hit Kyle), he had his hood up.

'The first thing I did was turn him around and say are you okay. He said ‘yeah, I’m fine just let me sit down’. Then he gets up and sits in the middle of the floor and lies himself down.

'He gets on the floor and is breathing heavily. A bit of spit and froth come out of his mouth. That’s when we went to find the medical woman.'

Kyle was rushed to the hospital before being transferred to a neurological unit at Southampton General Hospital.

Doctors established there was nothing they could do for him and he died the following day with his family around him.

GCSE student Kyle lived with mother Tanya Cooper, 42, his two elder brothers and sister at a semi-detached house in the Charminster area of Bournemouth.

The inquest continues.
