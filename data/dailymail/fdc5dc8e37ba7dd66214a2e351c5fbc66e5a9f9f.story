The return to the ground of their former club can be the making or breaking of a Premier League player. Will they buckle under the pressure or show the fans what they have been missing?

It is Rio Ferdinand's turn this weekend, with the former Manchester United stalwart returning to Old Trafford with QPR.

The defender will no doubt get a better reaction than players such as Sol Campbell and Samir Nasri at their old teams, but how do the United faithful usually greet their former heroes? Sportsmail looks at the some of the welcomes over the years.

Paul Ince (Liverpool, Middlesbrough)

Nicknamed the Guv'nor, Ince helped United to their first top division title in 26 years in 1992/93. However, Sir Alex Ferguson soon got tired of his attitude and shipped him off to Inter Milan.

No United fan would have expected him to end up at Liverpool two years later in 1997 though, and they didn't give him an easy ride on his first appearance back 'home' at Old Trafford.  

The England international was booed from start to finish in his two games as a Liverpool player there, and although things were a little easier with Middlesbrough, Ince took it to heart.

'I sweated blood for six years for that club and some of them give me stick,' he said. 'It disappoints me.'

Peter Schmeichel (Aston Villa)

Often heralded as the greatest goalkeeper in the Premier League era, Schmeichel, like Ince, ended up at one of United's biggest rivals. But his relationship at the club is much different.

After scooping five Premier League titles in his seven years at Old Trafford, Schmeichel made his way to Aston Villa and Manchester City via Sporting Lisbon in Portugal.

The goalkeeper received a rapturous reception with the Midlands side, while even when representing the blue side of Manchester he was talked about fondly.

Has admitted he was glad he pulled up injured in the warm-up ahead of City's visit to Old Trafford so his feelings wouldn't get the best of him, while he was even forgiven for producing his trademark celebration when Kevin Keegan's side won 3-1 at Maine Road earlier in the season.

David Beckham (AC Milan)

The poster boy from the famous Class of '92 graduates, Beckham walked out the door (helped along with a kick from Ferguson) in 2003 to join Real Madrid.

The midfield maestro said he would always support Manchester United, but had to wait until a loan move with AC Milan before he could meet the fans once again.

The Champions League tie was all but over by the time Beckham got on, while he was seen greeting and cuddling members of staff in the tunnel at half-time.

Given a standing ovation at full-time, Beckham donned the anti-Glazer green and gold scarf as he exited the pitch.

'When I first heard about the tie I think I almost cried because it is such a special place for me,' he said.

Carlos Tevez (Manchester City)

'I expect to have a good reception. While at United, I always gave my best and I had good relations with the fans,' Carlos Tevez, September 18, 2009.

Two days later he was subject of vile abuse, coin throwing and a chorus of boos upon entering the arena. Poor old naive Carlos.

But what else can he expect after leaving United despite the admiration of Ferguson, to join the wealthy rivals in a big-money deal?

After the 4-3 defeat, Tevez said: 'It was incredible because I have never seen something like that happen in the two years I played at Old Trafford, 

'As soon as I entered the field the atmosphere was very different. It was hard to take because previously I was always wanted by those people. But I suppose in football situations change.

Welcome to Manchester.

Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid)

Ever since turning up as a Portuguese teenager in 2004, Ronaldo's relationship with the United fans was special. For they had watched the scrwany winger transform into the best player in the world.

Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford in 2013 for a crucial Champions League round of 16 game for Real Madrid. He had joined his dream side, the Galacticos, for a world record fee two years earlier.

Undeterred by the emotions but also appreciative of the booming claps before kick-off, Ronaldo netted in a controversial fixture that saw Madrid advance in front of a fuming Ferguson.

The forward refused to celebrate, earning the respect of the Manchester faithful, and may well be back again soon..

‘I love Manchester,’ he told Sportsmail.

‘Everyone knows that — I have said it many times. Manchester is in my heart. I left many good friends there, the supporters are amazing and I wish I can come back one day.’
