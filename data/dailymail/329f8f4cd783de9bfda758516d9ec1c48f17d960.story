Justin Lee Collins' ex-girlfriend Anna Larke has spoken of the comedian's controlling ways during their turbulent relationship, claiming he made her cut contact with friends and family.

Former PR Anna, 38, said the Bristol-born funnyman, also 38, told her what clothes to wear and how to style her hair.

When they were out in public, he ordered her to look at ground in case she caught another man's eye in the street.

Anna spoke out in today's Daily Mirror after Justin was found guilty this week of a single charge of harassment causing her fear of violence on at least two occasions.

Judge John Plumstead described the crime as a
 'very serious matter' as he sentenced Collins to 140 hours community 
service and ordered him to pay £3,500 costs.

The former PR worker told how Collins started to take over her life within weeks of the couple moving into a flat in Kew, West London, in January, 2011.

Anna told the Daily Mirror: 'He stopped me talking to my old friends and family, he bought my clothes, told me what to wear, how to have my hair.'

She revealed that Collins was also incredibly jealous - telling her to 'look at the ground, the tree, any inanimate object' other than another man.

She admitted she felt 'humiliated' when he made her list every man she had been intimate with on a notepad, with details of contraception used, what body parts were touched and sexual positions.

Justin had left his wife Karen, 39, and their two children a few weeks earlier to move in with Anna, demanding the list of her conquests early into their relationship.

He also made her get a new mobile number and told her not to contact her friends, and even her brother.

She said: 'He made me close down my Facebook site, my Twitter. I wasn’t even allowed my own email, we had to have a joint one.

'Then he banned me from ringing my mum, who lives in Hertfordshire, unless he was in the room. Mum’s Greek and often we’d talk to each other in Greek on the phone but that had to stop too.'

'Mental abuse': Anna Larke saidCollins told her she was 'riddled with cellulite'

During the trial, Anna had told St Albans Crown Court how Justin had  had spat in her face, yanked her hair back, hit her between her legs and slapped her in the face causing 'hundreds' of bruises.

She said he forced her to close down 
her email and Facebook accounts, sleep facing him, compile an explicit 
dossier of her former lovers and throw away DVDs starring actors she 
found attractive.

Secret recordings were played in 
which Collins swore at Miss Larke calling her a '****ing slag', 'dirty 
vile whore' and '****ing coke head'.

The jury heard that at one point Collins told her: 'When you're with me 
you look at the ****ing ground, you look at a tree ... you don't look at
 any other ****ing human being.'

A jury of nine women and two men decided Collins was guilty of
 a single charge of harassment causing Miss Larke fear of violence on at
 least two occasions. The majority verdict came after almost 12 hours of
 deliberation and after one juror was dismissed.

But Mrs Collins – who is divorcing the presenter – gave evidence saying he was 'gentle, kind and generous'.

Speaking from her home in Bristol, Mrs Collins described the 
guilty verdict as 'ridiculous'. She said: 'At the moment my priority is 
the children. But I can say that I think the verdict is ridiculous. I 
don't believe it even for one second.'

Domestic violence charities reacted with fury after he escaped with a community sentence for harassment.

Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said: 'Until the courts give 
sentences that fit the crime, men like Justin Lee Collins will get away 
with campaigns of terror and thousands of women, like Anna, will 
continue to be at risk.'

Collins could have been jailed for up to five years for his campaign of physical and mental abuse against Anna.

The judge said: 'This is humbling work for someone who lives a prominent
 public life, but the very humility that manual work will induce will 
make you pause and think about what you have done.'

But Miss Larke's brother Alex, who gave evidence against Collins, suggested the sentence was lenient because he was a celebrity. He said: 'The maximum for what he did to my sister was prison, but we live in a time when celebrities unfortunately don't get what comes to them.'

Her family yesterday released a statement describing their relief at the verdict.

It said: 'We are absolutely ecstatic at the verdict and are relieved the jury were able to see through the lies of an abuser. We will not rest on our laurels in the wake of this good news and intend to go out into the world and use this experience to empower women to stand up to domestic abuse.'

In a statement, Collins's spokesman said: 'Justin is extremely disappointed by the verdict.'
