Adam Lallana is set to make his Liverpool debut at Tottenham on Sunday, Reds boss Brendan Rodgers confirmed after the £25 million summer signing from Southampton impressed at training during the week.

Lallana has recovered from a knee ligament injury picked up during training in Boston on Liverpool's pre-season tour of the US and joins striker Mario Balotteli among new faces available to Rodgers at White Hart Lane.  

'Adam Lallana will definitely be in the squad,' Rodgers confirmed on Friday. 'He has looked fantastic in training.'

'Fantastic': Brendan Rodgers confirmed Adam Lallana will be in the Liverpool squad Sunday at Tottenham

With Monday's 11pm transfer deadline looming Rodgers has said there'll more likely be a clear out of sorts than any further big name arrivals at Merseyside. 

'There aren't many more to come in, if any at all. We will have more going out than coming in,' Rodgers said.

'We have brought players in who can affect the team. That is the beauty of it. We are not relying on them all to make a difference.'

Jordon Ibe's loan departure to Derby County was confirmed earlier on Friday. 

Jose Enrique will be  available to Rodgers on Sunday although Glen Johnson will likely miss out due to thigh complaint. Questions marks hover over Alberto Moreno and Martin Skrtel, who picked up knocks during Monday's loss to Manchester City.

His most high profile addition Balotteli has been buoyant at training all week and slotted in well at the club, Rodgers said, but the manager was keen to avert the spotlight from his high-profile signing. 

The £16 million arrival from AC Milan gives Rodgers a good dilemma as to whether or not he hands the controversial but talented forward an instant debut.

Fans have also responded positively to Balotelli's arrival, congregating at Melwood to get a glimpse of the former City marksman. But when asked at his pre-match press conference about the Italy striker, Rodgers issued a reminder that there is more than one man in his squad. 

'Mario is fine and has settled in very well, but the focus is on his football,' Rodgers said.

'Balotelli is a class act. He is moving to Merseyside. But it's not the Balotelli show. The star of this team will always be the team.' 

Liverpool face Spurs on the back of a convincing loss to defending champions Manchester City but Rodgers is certain his side can pick themselves up quickly. 

He said: 'We have been good at bouncing back. It's a strange feeling but we are not used to losing. That's not sounding arrogant. We were flat coming off the pitch but there was a lot to be positive about.'
