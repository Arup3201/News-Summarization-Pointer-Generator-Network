Retail stores and other businesses may soon use facial recognition technology to identify and track big spenders.

Many retailers already use the technology to identify known shoplifters when they enter stores. Companies such as FaceFirst provide email or text notifications to alert business owners to known thieves.

Now, many companies are working on adding a new service in addition to security - boosting sales by tracking and targeting big-spending customers.

Instant recognition: Facial recognition technology makes an equation based on your facial features, like a fingerprint

UK-based NEC IT Solutions is already being used in several top stores around the U.S. to identify celebrities and valued customers.

When a valued customer enters the store, staff are sent vital information about them, including their name, clothing size, favorite brands and purchase history.

FaceFirst currently protects businesses from shoplifters.

'Just load existing photos of your known shoplifters, members of organized retail crime syndicates, persons of interest and your best customers into FaceFirst,' a marketing pitch on the companyâ€™s site explains.

'Instantly, when a person in your FaceFirst database steps into one of your stores, you are sent an email, text or SMS alert that includes their picture and all biographical information of the known individual so you can take immediate and appropriate action.'

Joseph Rosenkrantz, chief executive 
of FaceFirst, told The New York Times that he envisions stores using the
 system to recognize shoppers and send personalized offers to their 
phones.

Technology experts and consumer advocates are meeting to discuss just that in the first of a series of meetings concerning the technology in Washington D.C. on February 6.

The National Telecommunications & Information Administration will to develop a 'voluntary, enforceable code of conduct that specifies how the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights applies to facial recognition technology in the commercial context' in the meetings.

'Commercial facial recognition technology has the potential to provide important benefits and to support a new wave of technological innovation,' John Verdi, the agencyâ€™s director of privacy initiatives told the New York Times, 'but it also poses consumer privacy challenges.'
