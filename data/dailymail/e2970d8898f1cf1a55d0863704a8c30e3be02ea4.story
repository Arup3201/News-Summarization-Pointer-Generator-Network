While her elegant and demure sense of style remained the same, Kim Sears let her usual stoic demeanour drop today as she arrived at Wimbledon.

The 25-year-old smiled and laughed while walking into the stadium ahead of boyfriend Andy Murray’s third-round match against Roberto Bautista Agut of Argentina on Centre Court today.

Keeping her long hair in its straight, sleek style, Kim chose a below-the-knee white linen skirt from Hobbs, teamed with a laid-back cropped Levi denim jacket, black lace top, and funky leopard-print ballet pumps.

Once again the artist, who has been dating Murray for nine years and lives with him in Surrey, carried her beloved £1,395 cream Marylebone tote from Aspinal of London, which she has so far brought to every game.

Her cheerful attitude is no doubt a result of Andy’s stellar performances in Wimbledon thus far, having won his last two games - the last one in incredible straight sets.

And, as with most of the tennis champion’s matches throughout his career, Kim has been avidly watching each set from the side-lines.

Despite the media spotlight, Kim has not once faltered when it comes to fashion choices, choosing a white lace dress with cork wedges and a block print swallow dress with the same shoes for Andy's previous victorious matches.

Kim, who Murray has praised as a great support, has been highly expressive while watching him play

While her ensembles have reflected a cool and together young woman, Kim has not been able to help herself becoming emotional as she watches the matches.

Her face has reflected nearly every possible emotion as she gasps and cheers her way through the sets - and today's game is unlikely to be any different .

Despite his excellent form so far, Murray's game against Agut promises to be a nail-biting match, with his place in Wimbledon - where he is defending his title - hanging in the balance. 

However, despite the undoubted pressure he is no doubt feeling, having Kim by his side will be a comfort.

Murray, 27, has famously praised her ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship.

He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’
