Fifty suspected members of the LA Crips street gang have been arrested in a massive swoop by 1,300 FBI agents and LAPD officers.

The bust focused on the Five Deuce Broadway Gangster Crips, a gang with nearly 200 members operating in an area just west of the Skid Row district of Los Angeles, the FBI said.

Officers and agents working in small, heavily armed units burst into homes and properties around the area to seize suspects and weapons.

There were no reports of resistance to the surprise raids.

Suspects had their details taken in mobile police stations drafted in specifically for the operation before being carted off to jail.

Large quantities of weapons and drugs were seized and taken as evidence.

Most of those arrested were among 72 defendants named in a federal racketeering indictment which alleges their involvement in robberies, murders, extortion, witness intimidation and drug trafficking.

The suspects are alleged to have been involved in dealing drugs including PCP, methamphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine and crack cocaine, and cannabis.

U.S. Attorney André Birotte Jr said: 'Criminal street gangs make their livelihood by ruthlessly preying on the innocent people that live in the neighborhoods they claim as territory.

'What makes the conduct of this gang particularly insidious is not only the violent crimes alleged but also the exploitation of Skid Row drug users who are already living in difficult circumstances.'

Weapons seized included handguns, shotguns and even hunting rifles

Police struck yesterday morning after a three-year grand jury investigation led to a 112-count indictment. Suspects were taken away in buses while officers displayed dozens of seized weapons, including pistols, shotguns and hunting rifles.

Dubbed Operation Gremlin Riders, after the violent clique targeted, the swoop aimed at breaking up 'a criminal enterprise that used violence and intimidation to control an area centering on the intersection of 52nd Street and South Broadway in South Los Angeles,' the FBI said.

The gang formed in the 1970s to confront rival street gangs, the FBI said, but had since grown into an organised crime cartel 'that conducts annual meetings and enforces a strict set of rules.'

Specific allegations against members include four murders since 1987, including killings of unarmed victims with no gang affiliations; conspiracy to murder a fellow gang member who had given statements to police; 'follow home' robberies that targeted people who'd just been to banks; and 'numerous' drug deals near schools and playgrounds.

It also accused gang members of firing shots at California Highway Patrol Officers during a high speed chase two years ago.

Of the 50 people arrested yesterday, 48 were named in the federal indictment and two more were arrested on local charges. A further 17 grand jury suspects were already in custody on unrelated charges and eight more remain at large.

All those named in the federal indictment face potential minimum sentences of 10 years in prison, but many face terms of life without parole.

The Crips are an almost exclusively African-American gang founded in South Central LA in 1969 by Raymond Washington and Stanley 'Tookie' Williams. These days it operates as a loosely connected network of individual street gangs.

Members of the Crips had been known for their use of the colour blue in their clothing, and their bitter rivalry with the Bloods, a rival gang identifiable by the colour red.
