If Amelie Mauresmo is doing some backseat driving at Wimbledon then it must have been a ride of Rolls Royce comfort so far.

This introduction could hardly have gone better, with Andy Murray easing through the gears and making the last 16, and the sanctuary of the middle weekend, for the loss of just 19 games in three matches.

Faced with the in-form opposition of world No 23 Roberto Bautista Agut last night he responded by putting on an exhibition of sublime grass-court tennis to win 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 in just an hour and 35 minutes.

Get in: Murray now plays Kevin Anderson in the last 16

No wonder the 26-year-old Spaniard, who as a schoolboy was on the books of Valencia, joked beforehand he would rather be taking on the defending champion at football, a passion they share to the point where they have attended La Liga matches together.

The excellence of Murray rendered this a mismatch, with the only glitch en route to a fourth-round match against South African giant Kevin Anderson the loss of two service games.

Murray has talked about the need for energy conservation ahead of greater challenges, and so far he has only been out there for five hours and 12 minutes. Were it not for the odd scratchy game towards the end, when Bautista Agut began to hit freely, this would have been even briefer than his second-round romp past Blaz Rola.

This match coincided with his brother playing (and winning) in the doubles, and Murray feigned indignation afterwards that his family had opted to watch Jamie.

‘I’m obviously the No 2 son, he is the priority. My brother is obviously more important than me, that’s why I’m so competitive,’ he said.

Murray then added more seriously: ‘It was a step up today and I thought I responded well. It’s been a good week and now I can rest up and be fresh for Monday. I had enough long matches in the French Open to get me physically ready.’

Murray stressed last week that it would be too early for anyone to blame Mauresmo if anything went wrong in the opening rounds, so by the same token it may be  premature to give her too much credit.

Yet beyond doubt is that her charge has been spot-on so far in negotiating his title defence, and her presence appears to have been just as calming as Ivan Lendl’s ever was at this stage.

20 - Leonardo Mayer finally reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam at his 20th attempt.

5 - Jo-Wilfried Tsonga played on each of the first five days.

6.3m - Rafael Nadal has more Twitter followers than any other player.

4 - Four-set defeat for Jonny Marray and John-Patrick Smith in doubles.

21- Novak Djokovic clinched his 21st consecutive Grand Slam 4th round appearance. 

27 - Lucie Safarova made the last 16 for the first time at the age of 27.

42 - Lleyton Hewitt broke Andre Agassi’s record for most five-setters played in Grand Slams.

7- Seventeen-year-old Belinda Bencic is the first Swiss woman to reach the third round.

It is hard to recall in Murray this week a single moment of the destructive exasperation that can sometimes creep in. Stiffer tests are sure to come, starting with 6ft 8in Anderson who, as Murray observed, is currently playing the best tennis of his career to push his ranking up to No 18.

He can cause anyone problems with his huge serve and heavy hitting, but generally the 27-year-old Scot copes well with very tall opponents, as his return is one of the best in the game and he can exploit  their more awkward movement and keep them off balance in the rallies.

The South African’s serve will definitely be more potent than that of Bautista Agut, who has battled his way up from obscurity and an almost non-existent junior career through the typical Spanish tennis value of sheer hard work.

He came in here with some  very decent form, having beaten excellent grass-courters such as Nicolas Mahut and Benjamin Becker en route to the ATP title in Holland last week.

That put him on an unlikely seven-match grass-court winning streak for a man who has only played one Wimbledon before, when he reached the second round last year.

Murray had walked out at what is a familiar time for him, early evening, his first at this hour during the 2014 campaign due to his defending champion status on Monday and World Cup clashes on Wednesday.

Bautista Agut, with whom he trained during the clay-court season in Valencia, started with admirable assurance by claiming the first six points of the match before a Murray ace stemmed the flow.

No worries: Murray has won nine sets without dropping one after an impressive first week for the Scot

For a Spaniard he hits the ball remarkably flat — partly explaining his recent success on grass — but then Murray switched to softballing him to draw some mistakes before finding an almost perfect blend of defence and attack.

He was flying by the time he reached 5-2 in the second set and had three set points, only to waste them and then, by way of self-punishment, drop his serve for the first time in the tournament the next game.

He then rattled off the next five games in exhibition style before one other poor service game  interrupted his march to the last 16.

Murray looks extremely sharp and his has been the most convincing passage thus far with only Roger Federer, still in the third round, having looked similarly at ease.
