Hundreds of shoppers who fought over big screen TVs on Black Friday are now struggling to sell them on internet auction sites such as eBay.

Customers were seen fighting over the 40 inch Polaroid TVs, which had been reduced by £80 at Asda stores around the country. Others bargain hunters were seen brawling over the 50 inch Blaupunkt HD TV in Tesco stores, where they were reduced by £150 from £399 to £249. 

Many queued for hours to get their hands on the televisions, which sold out within minutes at the supermarkets.

But today, many of the bargain Blaupunkt TVs have already been placed on eBay and are struggling to get any interest.

Lots of Polaroid TVs have also been placed on the auction site, with one writing: 'Black Friday deal polaroid TV in box not been opened. Purchased 29/11/14 from Asda.'

Another enterprising punter is even trying to just sell the television box but has attracted no bids so far. The seller has written: 'Empty polaroid 40 inch TV box brand new as from black Friday, complete with polystyrene.'

Across Britain last week, Black Friday frenzy took hold with shoppers likening shops to 'war zones' as everyone tried to get their hands on the best bargains. Queues had formed before midnight as many retailers, who had heavily advertised Black Friday savings, opened early.

In Tesco stores up and down the country, desperate shoppers were seen scrapping as they tried to get a Blaupunkt HD TV.

At an Asda store in Wembley, shocking footage emerged showing a woman clinging on to a Polaroid TV - which had been reduced by just £80 to £139 - during a tug of war fight with two teenagers.

The woman is seen clambering over the box and, at one point, is thrown to the floor as she attempts to hold onto the cut-price TV, before a staff is forced to intervene.

Police were also called to deal with scuffles at a number of retailers' stores across the UK.
