If I were the Liverpool manager there wouldn’t be a moment’s doubt about what to do next with Luis Suarez. I’d keep him. Leave aside, just for a moment, questions of morality or whether his ban is long enough and what is going on is his head to make him do these extraordinarily bad things.

Purely and simply from a football perspective, what he does for you on the pitch — and I don’t mean biting people - makes him indispensable. And with the season Liverpool have ahead of them, that’s truer than ever.

They had a brilliant 2013-14, pushing for the title when many people thought they might struggle to get into the top four. Although they didn’t win it, they were superb, with Suarez the single most significant reason for that.

Bite man: Luis Suarez bites Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini and ended up with a nine game international ban and ban from all football activity for four months

The Premier League will be at least as tough next season, probably much tougher with Louis van Gaal at a new-look Manchester United, and Liverpool will have Champions League football, too, so any manager at Anfield would want Suarez in the team.

So that’s the football decision. It’s an easy one to make.

But if I were the chief executive or the money man at Liverpool, I’d have him up for sale already. The issue is one of risk and what might happen in the future given a pattern of behaviour. Keeping Suarez may potentially cost Liverpool tens of millions of pounds. Perhaps £70million or more.

How so? If he went somewhere else this summer — Spain, I guess, with Barcelona and Real Madrid showing recent interest and having the money — Liverpool cash in on their biggest asset. Yes, it will be a tough ask to replace such quality, but if all the proceeds and more were re-invested in a proven striker, it might make sense.

If Liverpool don’t sell him and he bites someone else after his ban ends, he could he thrown out for years.

Madness: Suarez was charged with biting someone for the third time in his career

Tooth ache: Suarez goes down holding his front teeth

Suarez certainly made his mark on this World Cup, albeit in regrettable fashion. Unfortunately this tournament will now be remembered as the one where Suarez bit someone. Amid all his goals and game- winning performances, the statistic that  stands out in his career is being banned for dozens of games in total for biting people.

Speaking to Uruguay fans here after the incident, the general feeling is of support and love for Suarez because he gives so much for the team on the pitch and is a great player.

Support: Uruguay have backed Suarez and will appeal the decision

The solution to the Suarez situation could be that if Barca do want him, I’d demand Alexis Sanchez in a swap deal.

I wasn’t watching the Uruguay-Italy match but saw a mention on social media as soon as the incident happened. For a few moments, I couldn’t believe he’d done it again. I thought it must be an old joke or a wind-up. Then the videos and photographs started flowing online. It’s just incredible behaviour, baffling.

I was just about at the point where not only did I think of Suarez as a fantastic player but that he’d rid himself of the devil inside and left all the rubbish behind.

But one chomp later it’s obvious he’s still Jekyll and Hyde.

Playing for keeps: Ferdinand says Brendan Rodgers should try and keep hold of Luis Suarez

Star man: Suarez helped Liverpool almost win the title last season

Key man: Suarez was named player of the year by both the players and the football writers

Within a fortnight he’s gone from a hero who can barely run but still manages to mastermind the beating of England, to a pariah banned from all football for four months.

The punishment, like the man himself, will polarise opinion. He had to be punished. He hasn’t got off lightly. Neither would I argue with those who sincerely feel he should have been banned for longer.

What he did is just inexplicable. I have three young kids and they asked me about what happened. ‘Dad, why did he bite that other player?’

We don’t know, do we? He evidently has some demons to handle when he’s on the pitch, sometimes. By all accounts he is a good team-mate and decent bloke away from it.

Tough battle: Rio Ferdinand says Suarez is one of the best players in the Premier League

‘He did a really bad thing, he was naughty,’ is how I explained it to my children. ‘He’s going to be punished. He won’t be allowed to play football or even go to games for a while.’ But of course they already know it’s bad to bite people.

Is his problem surmountable? Nobody can say. We all thought after last season that he was a changed man.

He’s created a huge dilemma now for Liverpool and I don’t envy them the decisions ahead.

Luis Suarez is indispensable for what he does on the pitch

Suarez could be sold for up to £70m and that could be too big to resist

If Barcelona want to buy Suarez then Liverpool should try and get Alexis Sanchez as part of the deal
