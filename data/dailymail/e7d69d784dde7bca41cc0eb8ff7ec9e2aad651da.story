Rickie Fowler's special Ryder Cup lavish haircut may get full points for patriotism but for intimidation factor the US star has fallen well short, at least with Europe veteran Lee Westwood.

Fowler, 25, made quite the entrance at Gleneagles on Monday sporting the letters USA shaved into the side of his head. 

Eight-time Ryder Cup competitor Westwood was impressed, but not fazed, and Fowler shouldn't hold his breath if he thinks he's started a trend.

'I've seen it. I've touched it. I gave it a stroke yesterday on the range!' Westwood joked in his pre-event press conference.

Asked if he would adopt something similar, the 41-year-old added: 'I know I've got a big head, but I don't know if it's big enough to fit "Europe' on it.

'I find it quite amusing. It's the sort of thing that a 25-year-old lad that's right behind his team does, I suppose. That's the kind of character he is and fair play to him.

'Suits him, I think. Looks good.'
