North Korea is to publish its own report saying its human rights record is 'bright and rosy' - six months after the UN condemned the regime accusing the secretive state of committing crimes against humanity.

The North's Association for Human Rights Studies said the report would counter the 'lies and fabrications' made by unspecified 'hostile forces' about the rights situation in the isolated state.

North Korea is regularly listed among the world's worst human rights offenders in indexes compiled by governments, UN agencies and rights watchdogs.

In one of the most comprehensive reports to date, a UN inquiry into the North's rights record published its findings in February and detailed a wide range of systemic abuses including murder, enslavement and torture.

The commission concluded that many of the violations constituted crimes against humanity and suggested they could be placed before the International Criminal Court.

The report likened North Korea's regime to Nazism and called for the International Criminal Court to close political prison camps.

The use of systematic torture, starvation, and killings is akin to punishments ordered under Adolf Hitler, the report stated.

'The gravity, scale and nature of these violations revealed a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,' it said.

However, North Korea rejected the report as a 'sheer fabrication' invented by the United States and its allies.

The country is estimated to have 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in its sprawling gulag system

A spokesman from the North's rights association said its own report would help people 'do away with their prejudice and misunderstanding' about the rights situation in the country.

'The report will show the true picture of the people of the (North) dynamically advancing towards a brighter and rosy future,' he said in an interview with the North's official KCNA news agency.

No release date was given but the spokesman said the report would be published in 'the near future'.

The impoverished but nuclear-armed North has been ruled for more than six decades by the Kim family dynasty that has maintained power with an iron fist and zero tolerance for political dissent.

The country is estimated to have 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners in its sprawling gulag system.

Those who are caught crossing the border to China in a bid to flee poverty and repression at home are often sent to jail or executed.

In February, the UN's commission of inquiry into human rights in North Korea published a damning report detailing human rights abuses committed by the country's leadership against its own people. 

They compared the scale of the abuse to the atrocities committed by the Nazis.

Michael Kirby, the chair of the report, personally wrote to Kim Jong-un to warn him that he could face trial at The Hague for his personal culpability in crimes against humanity.

The UN's Commission on human rights in North Korea gathered evidence for more almost a year. It said there was compelling evidence of torture, execution and arbitary imprisonment, deliberate starvation and a lack of free thought. 

Michael Kirby, an Australian retired judge, who was chairman of the panel, said: 'The commission wishes to draw your attention that it will therefore recommend that the United Nations refer the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea [the formal name for North Korea] to the international criminal court to render accountable all those, including possibly yourself, who may be responsible for the crimes against humanity.'

At the time of the report was published, Mr Kirby said there were 'many parallels' between the evidence he heard and crimes committed by the Nazis during the Second World War.

In one case a prison camp inmate had been given the task of burning the bodies of those who had starved to death before the remains were used as fertiliser. 

Mr Kirby said: 'Now the international community does know. There will be no excusing a failure of action because we didn't know. It's too long now. The suffering and the tears of the people of North Korea demand action.'

The report was 400-pages long and concluded there was overwhelming evidence that crimes against humanity have been and are still being committed. 

The inquiry also found 'an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'.

It reported on the vast network of secret prison camps known as kwanliso where hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are believed to have died. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 120,000 political prisoners are still held and their cases are often kept secret.

The report says: 'Their families are not informed of their fate or whereabouts. Persons accused of political crimes therefore become victims of enforced disappearance.

'Making the suspect disappear is a deliberate feature of the system that serves to instil fear in the population.'

If a woman becomes pregnant by a Chinese man, newborn babies are often drowned or the mother is forced to have an abortion. 

The report also said the state often uses food as a means of control over the population. 

'It has prioritised those whom the authorities believe to be crucial in maintaining the regime over those deemed expendable', the report said.
