More than 100 riot police broke up a frenzied crowd last night desperate to buy a new $220 Nike basketball shoe released for the NBA All-Star Game.

The crowd in Orlando, Florida, got unruly as hundreds of people packed a car park and waited for the limited-edition Nike Foamposite One.

Shoppers were asked to wait across the street when the mall closed at 9pm, but one person ran toward Foot Locker and the crowd followed.

Madness: The crowd in Orlando, Florida, got unruly as hundreds of people packed a car park and waited for the limited-edition Nike Foamposite One

It comes after the re-release of the Nike Air Jordan XI before Christmas caused mayhem in the U.S. as shoppers fought and broke down doors.

Police formed a line on Thursday and used shields to push back the crowd, while they told shoppers there would be no shoe release.

There were no injuries or arrests outside the Florida Mall, authorities said, but disorder was seen breaking out around 9:45pm.

‘I saw hundreds of people running toward me,’ shopper Amanda Charles, 20, told the Orlando Sentinel. ‘I thought I was going to get trampled.’

Ms Charles, who had made the 150-mile drive from Jacksonville to Orlando with six friends to buy the shoe, was waiting for its release at midnight.

But when the crowd got out of control, shoppers say police pushed them back and threatened to use pepper spray, but never did.

Other shoppers said the scene was ‘pandemonium’. Many had gathered because the shoes can be worth up to 10 times their retail price at resale.

‘It's unfortunate it happened over a shoe event, but we were proactive in our response and lucky it ended well,’ an Orange County Sheriff's Office's spokesman told Fox affiliate WOFL.

Foot Looker put on a day of events at its ‘House of Hoops’, including NBA player signings and a makeshift court, reported the Orlando Sentinel.

The shoes were inspired by a galactic theme, which fits in with Orlando’s image as the home of NASA and the Kennedy Space Center.

There were further appearances by NBA stars planned at the Foot Locker for Friday and Saturday, such as New York Knicks sensation Jeremy Lin.

But safety concerns have forced all further All Star events this weekend to be cancelled at stores in Florida, a Foot Locker spokesman said.

The Nike Air Jordan XI riots in December were over the shoes first worn 15 years ago by Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan.

Police used pepper spray in Seattle, Washington, four people were arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, and there were fights in Louisville, Kentucky.

Unruly crowds forced two stores shut in Austin, Texas, fights broke out in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a gunshot was fired in Richmond, California.
