A truck driver has been hailed a hero after he saved a one-year-old girl he found crawling along a highway.

Bryant Collins was traveling along Highway 72 in Carlton, Georgia on Friday when he spotted the baby girl and pulled over. He took care of her in his truck until police arrived.

The baby had crawled 300 yards from home 
through the woods, fallen down a 15ft embankment and was dangerously close to the highway when Mr 
Collins pulled over in his truck at 10am.Â

Mr Collins told 11Alive: 'The baby started crying. so I turned my phone on and let her listen to some gospel music and 
she calmed right down.'

The baby suffered insect bites and minor scratches.

Good Samaritan Mr Collins not so long ago turned his own life around after spending ten years in jail for cocaine production.

He was released five years ago, no longer takes drugs and has a job as an auto-repairman.

Mr Collins told KTVI: 'It made me feel good that I could be in society and do good, just as well as you can do bad, you can do good, you know.'

The girl's father, 37-year-old Timothy 
Pickens, has been charged with child cruelty, reckless conduct and 
obstruction, according to authorities.

Madison County sheriff's officials said 
the girl's father approached while deputies were investigating and was 
arrested after a scuffle.

Mr Collins waited with the baby girl at his truck until the authorities arrived. He then stayed for another two hours to make sure she was okay

The girl's mother told authorities she 
and her husband left the house and their other children, ages 13, nine and five, were supposed to be watching the baby.

The Department of Family and Children Services was brought in but decided to release the child to the mother's care so that she could be taken for medical treatment.

Authorities said charges 
also could be filed against the girl's mother.

It's unclear if Pickens has an
 attorney, and a number listed for him is out of service.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the Madison County Sheriff's Office.
