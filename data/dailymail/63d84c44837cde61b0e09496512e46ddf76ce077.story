A Texas man has been arrested in the kidnapping of a 23-year-old woman, it emerged Saturday.

Suspect Enrique Arochi, 24, was apprehended that day and faces an aggravated kidnapping charge, WFAA reported.

The charge is in relation to the disappearance Christina Morris, according to the affiliate station. 

Where is she? Christina Morris, pictured, was last seen with Enrique Arochi in a parking garage on August 30 

According to WFAA, DNA evidence had been linked to a vehicle belonging to Arochi - and it was towed on the day of his arrest.

David Tilley, a spokesman for the Plano Police Department, told the affiliate station 'The DNA evidence and the details that surround that... if we were able to release that, you would understand it more. Unfortunately, we're unable to release that.'

Tilley also said 'We have nothing to show evidence one way or another whether [Christina Morris is] dead or alive at this point in time.'

Arochi's bail was set at $1million, the affiliate station reported.

He previously told WFAA 'I feel they are wasting their time on me when they can be looking at somebody else that is actually the suspect, or the person that actually did it.' 

Morris was last seen with him in a parking garage on August 30, which was picked up by security camera footage, according to the media outlet.

Christina Morris, who went missing in August, has still not been found by authorities 

WFAA reported that last month Arochi had been charged with interfering with the investigation.

Referring to Arochi, Tilley told the affiliate station, 'A lot of deception on his part that we believe was intentional, that created problems with our investigation.'

CBS Dallas Fort Worth, citing a warrant, reported that bodily fluids, hair and DNA evidence were sought by authorities when examining Arochi's vehicle.

Morris' mother Jonni McElroy told Star Local Media 'I’m overwhelmed with excitement that our work, I believe, is eventually going to come to a closure and we'll get the answers that we need.

She continued 'In my heart I feel like we’re going to celebrate Christmas with her. ... We’re still going to worry, but ... I have a little bit of sparkle that’s shining through my heart right now.'
