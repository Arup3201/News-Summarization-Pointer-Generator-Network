Prince Harry’s girlfriend has overcome her concerns about marrying into the Royal family, it was claimed today.

Cressida Bonas, 24, has ‘got used to the idea’ of marriage and children with the 29-year-old Prince - and a wedding is expected to take place next year, according to friends of the couple.

‘Cressie is going to marry Harry,’ one of the dance student’s friends told The Sunday Telegraph. ‘Harry never stops talking about marriage and children, and she has now got used to the idea.’

It comes as Harry was mobbed by tens 
of thousands of adoring fans on Sydney’s famous harbour as he began his 
first official visit of Australia yesterday - which he attended without 
Miss Bonas.

Prince Harry accidentally gatecrashed a man proposing marriage to his girlfriend on a hotel rooftop in Sydney, it was reported today.

Accompanied by a woman, Harry and about 20 others who had joined him at his luxury Sydney hotel to watch a fireworks spectacular over the harbour, surprised the couple as the man, flowers in hand, was making his proposal.

Ian Sjaichudin, the male whose proposal was interrupted, told Channel Seven news he was asking his girlfriend to marry him on the roof of the Shangri-La hotel when Harry and his party turned up as the fireworks were exploding.

The incident occurred when Prince Harry and his party headed up to the roof, having been informed that it offered a superb view out over the harbour, where the fireworks were to be set off as part of the celebrations for the Royal Australian Navy's 100th birthday.

Screams greeted 
the Prince as he went on a walkabout among the excited crowds after 
officially attending the International Fleet Review, which involved 40 
warships from 17 nations.

Despite
being in Australia to represent the Queen, Harry’s party-loving 
reputation preceded him, as one national newspaper warned the country’s 
Prime Minister Tony Abbott to ‘lock up his daughters’.

Harry
has been dating Miss Bonas since July 2012 and sparked rumours in 
August when he whisked her off on an African safari, just like his 
brother William did with Kate in 2010 when he proposed.

Miss
Bonas, who recently graduated from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire in 
London, avoids the public eye wherever possible and the couple are very 
careful about being photographed together.

They
went to see a James Blunt concert last Monday in Notting Hill, west 
London, and then went to see West End musical The Book of Mormon the 
follow day.

And they were 
seen arriving at London King’s Cross station together following the 
society wedding of Thomas van Straubenzee to the Duke of 
Northumberland's daughter Lady Melissa Percy in June.

Yesterday, despite
a 20-hour flight from the UK, Harry showed no sign of jet lag as he 
boarded the Australian Navy’s survey ship HMAS Leeuwin.

The Prince was dressed in a white Army tropical uniform with the sky-blue beret of Army Air Corps.

Harry
was joined on board the Leeuwin by Mr Abbott, and Governor-General 
Quentin Bryce, the Queen’s representative in Australia.

As Harry sailed past the Sydney Opera House, tens of thousands of spectators roared at him.

Later, he changed into a navy blue suit for a walkabout among the  adoring crowds. Among them was student Lauren Burke, 22, who resembled Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas, 24.

She said: ‘I tried my best to flirt with him but it was quite formal and he was well behaved. I told him if he ever wanted to look around Sydney, I would be his guide. He smiled and laughed.’

Another onlooker, trainee medic Renee Simmons, 21, described Harry as ‘gorgeous’, adding: ‘I’m in love. He wears a uniform very well.’

The Prince then made his way across the harbour by boat to Kirribilli House, the official residence of the Australian prime minister.

He posed for photographs with Mr Abbott, his wife Margie and their daughters, Frances, 22, and Bridget, 20 – who the politician had described as ‘not bad looking’ during the recent election campaign.

Mr Abbott, a staunch monarchist, apologised to Harry for his nation’s strong republican movement, saying: ‘I regret to say that not every Australian is a monarchist, but today everyone feels like a monarchist.’

THE press had warned him to ‘lock up his daughters’ – but Mr Abbott was more than happy to introduce Prince Harry to Bridget, 20, Frances, 22, and his wife Margie at his official residence.

The fleet review climaxed with a stunning fireworks display over Sydney Harbour Bridge seen by an estimated million spectators.

He described his Sydney experience as ‘absolutely fantastic’ before boarding Mr Abbott's jet today to fly to the west coast city of Perth.

‘It's just ... really sad that we're leaving,’ the 29-year-old royal told reporters before boarding the jet. ‘Work - just can't get the time off work nowadays.’

‘The next time I come back you're going to be struggling to get rid of me, I'm sure,’ he added.

Western Australia state Premier Colin

throne explained that he had to be home in a few days.

‘He said it was a short visit because he had to be back to work on Thursday,’ Mr Barnett told reporters.

He is then heading to Dubai on Monday for a gala dinner for his charity Sentebale.

Prince Harry last visited Australia in 2003 during his gap year, when he worked on a ranch in the outback.
