The start of Sydney's whale-watching season has kicked off in spectacular fashion, with up to 10 humpback whales spotted off Bondi Beach and near Botany Bay.

A treat for those making the most the unusually warm autumn weather, two humpbacks were seen playing with a pod of dolphins off Bondi Beach on Saturday morning. This was followed by another five seen around the same area in the afternoon.

Jonas Liebschner from Whale Watching Sydney said the large number of animals sighted was extraordinary, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Welcome: The start of the whale-watching season kicked off with a stellar number of humpback whales spotted of the Bondi Beach coast, pictured, and Botany Bay in Sydney's south east

Frolicking: The pods of whales were seen playing together off the coast, to the admiration of onlookers who were keen to catch a glimpse of the majestic animals

'(It) is a phenomenal number for this early in the season,' he said. Mr Liebschner confirmed that four humpbacks were also spotted near Botany Bay, in Sydney's south east.

But those who missed out should not fret, with more expected throughout the season. Mr Liebschner said whale numbers had steadily increased by about 10 per cent in the last five to six years.

As part of their migration, about 20,000 whales will travel north past Sydney as they make their way to sub-tropical breeding grounds off the Queensland coast.

On their way back, this number is expect to be about 22,000 whales, with the addition of 2,000 newborn calves, Mr Liebschner said.

Making a splash: Adult humpback whales can grown up to 16 metres long as adults and weigh more than 36,000 kilograms

More than 20,000 humpbacks are expected to pass Sydney as they head north to warmer waters off the Queensland coast

As part of their migration from Antarctic waters, the whales make 5,000km trip along Australia's east coast

For those hoping to catch a glimpse of a humpback or many of the other species of whale, the mammals will complete the 5,000km trip along Australia's east coast from Antarctic waters - one of the longest in the animal kingdom - in the coming months.

The whales' northern migration can run into August and they often travel in pods and along the Great Barrier Reef before arriving in the Whitsundays area, according to Discover Hervey Bay.

Once in warmer waters the animals give birth and mate before making their way to Antarctic waters by the end of spring. On their southern migration, most humpbacks will leave the Queensland coast by the start of November.

Humpbacks, which can grow up to about 16 metres as adults and weigh more than 36,000 kilograms, spend the summer feeding on prawn-like krill in Antarctic waters.

Large whales are most likely to be seen in Australian waters between June and October, according to ABC.

About 40 species of whales and dolphins have been recorded in Australian waters.Â 

To best see the whales, watchers should pick a clear and calm day on a prominent headland.
