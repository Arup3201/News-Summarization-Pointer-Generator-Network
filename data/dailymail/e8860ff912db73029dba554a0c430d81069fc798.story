When New York was plunged into darkness last week during a blackout caused by Hurricane Sandy, the city streets became alien and frightening to most residents.

But as these eerie yet now familiar-looking photographs show, it is not the first time that the city has been left to find its way in the dark. In the summer of 1959, New York suffered a similar blackout - although the consequences were far less devastating that those wreaked by Sandy.

On August 31 that year, a 500-block radius around Central Park in Manhattan suffered a black-out - believed to have been caused because the grid could not cope with so many people using increasingly popular refrigerators and air conditioners in a heatwave.

The power was cut just as night fell, 
leaving New Yorkers to do their best to make their way to cafes and bars
where people crowded around candles as shown in the atmospheric but 
gloomy photographs taken by LIFE nearly half a century ago.

Gloomy: The summer blackout, which lasted for 13 hours, was believed to have been caused when the circuit overloaded due to the increasing popularity of refrigerators and AC

The pictures are strikingly familiar to those taken in the aftermath of Sandy as residents huddled together, shared food and warmth and helped each other through until daybreak. Reassuringly some things haven't changed - police reported very little crime during the 1959 blackout, a statement echoed by the NYPD in 2012.

Fortunately for New Yorkers back then, their power cut lasted just 13 hours. The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy was far more devastating. The ferocious storm killed at least 113 people and two million remain without power as the bitter November cold sets in.

Last week, the lower half of Manhattan was almost in complete darkness after power was cut off when an electrical substation blew up due to surging flood waters in the East River.

Although the situation has vastly improved on the island, about 1.9million homes and businesses remained in the dark for the seventh night in devastated communities up and down the East Coast - with Staten Island, Long Island, New Jersey and parts of Brooklyn some of the worst hit.Â
