Light-hearted: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson joked that Tory traditionalists are uneasy about gay rights because 'biddies don't like botties'

A Cabinet Minister who is opposed to David Cameron’s plan to allow same-sex marriages has light-heartedly said Tory traditionalists are uneasy about gay rights because ‘biddies don’t like botties’.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is among more than  100 Conservative MPs opposed to giving gays and lesbians the same rights to marry as heterosexual couples.

Wealthy Right-winger Mr Paterson, married to aristocrat’s daughter Rose Ridley, is known for his outspoken views.

He is a diehard opponent of Brussels and wind farms and a vociferous supporter of foxhunting. He has long been sceptical about gay rights and expresses his views in colourful terms privately.

Summing up why older members of the Tory faithful oppose measures such as gay marriage, Mr Paterson quipped: ‘It’s simple – biddies don’t like botties.’

The comment has shocked some more liberal-minded Conservative MPs but provocative Mr Paterson revels in repeating it to others.

A source close to the Cabinet Minister said: ‘Owen has no problem with the big strides made in improving equality for gays and lesbians. But he thinks same-sex marriage is a step too far.

‘He believes the Government ought to be concentrating on the economy and Europe instead of obsessing with gay rights.

And most ordinary members of the Tory Party agree with him. They don’t want their leaders endlessly going on about gays.’

The scale of the Tory revolt over the issue was underlined last night when Wellingborough MP Peter Bone warned: ‘It is by no means impossible that David Cameron could be brought down as Conservative leader by his gay marriage plans.

‘He is completely out of step with the mainstream of his party.’

To add to the Tory disarray, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will tomorrow denounce Tory ‘fantasists’ who oppose gay marriage.

Criticised: Paterson is opposed to giving gays the same rights to marry as heterosexuals. David Cameron has faced criticism from some within the Conservative party over the plans

In a keynote speech to mark his five years as Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Clegg will say: ‘The Tory Right dreams of a fantasy world where we can pretend the world hasn’t moved on, oppose equal marriage and refuse to accept the verdict of the British people by pretending the Conservatives won a majority at the last Election.’

And in a leaked email, Lib Dem Minister Lynne Featherstone boasted Mr Clegg forced reluctant Tory Ministers to introduce gay marriage laws.

‘I am so proud of our party because – don’t let anyone fool you – it’s because of Liberal Democrats that this is happening,’ she said in an email to Lib Dem MPs.
