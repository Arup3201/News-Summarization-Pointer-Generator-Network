The flu epidemic continues to rage into the new year with the deadly virus now widespread in 43 U.S. states - up seven from the previous count.

According to the Centers for Disease Control Prevention there have been 21 pediatric deaths this season as a result of the mutated H3N2 strain, with six fatalities in the week of Christmas alone.

During this period, there were 7,289 newly diagnosed infections, bringing the total number of cases to 37,938.

CDC's Dr. Michael Jhung announced on Monday that the situation could worsen as the flu has yet to rev up to high levels in large states like New York and California.

While the rest of the country is on red alert, the West Coast and Alaska have been experiencing outbreaks at a 'regional' level.

There have been 'sporadic' incidents in Hawaii and no reports in Washington, D.C., Guam or the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Because the flu strain  has mutated this year the CDC says  vaccines currently on the market may be ineffective.

Those particularly at risk of illness are those over 65 and children younger than four. 

Across the nation, 3,441 people have been hospitalized because of the growing crisis.

According to the CDC, data from 122 U.S. cities showed deaths from influenza and pneumonia exceeded the national baseline.

About 96 per cent of flu cases so far this year have been the virulent H3N2 sub-type, the CDC reported. 

Another state hit hard has been Minnesota, where health officials have made it clear to parents that this year's flu strain is particularly strong.

The flu has proved fatal to children with no apparent underlying health problems and statistics from the Minnesota Department of Health have revealed that in some parts of the state up to 50 per cent of students have been absent in December while battling the illness. 

Shannon Zwanziger, 17, from Minnesota, passed away in early December after contracting the flu

Shannon Zwanziger, a 17-year-old senior at Owatonna High School in Minnesota died at the Mayo Clinic in early December from the flu.

Initially falling ill with a fever and sore throat, Shannon deteriorated at home and her heart stopped beating while she was in her mother's arms after being sick for one week.

Despite the paramedics and best efforts, she passed away.

The CDC admitted earlier this month that the vaccine does not protect well against the dominant strain, H3N2.

That strain tends to cause more deaths and hospitalizations, especially in the elderly.

'Though we cannot predict what will happen the rest of this flu season, it's possible we may have a season that's more severe than most,' said CDC director, Dr Tom Frieden.

CDC officials think the vaccine should provide some protection and still are urging people to get vaccinated. 

Flu vaccine effectiveness tends to vary from year to year. 

Last winter, flu vaccine was 50 to 55 per cent effective overall, which experts consider relatively good.

Among infectious diseases, flu is considered one of the nation's leading killers. 

On average, about 24,000 Americans die each flu season, according to the CDC.

Nearly 150 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed for this winter's flu season.

Current flu vaccines are built to protect against three or four different kinds of flu virus, depending on the product. 

The ingredients are selected very early in the year, based on predictions of what strains will circulate the following winter.

The ingredients always include a Type A H3N2 flu virus. The most severe flu seasons tend to be dominated by some version of that kind of flu bug. 

The three most deadly flu seasons of the last ten years - in the winters of 2003-2004, 2007-2008, and 2012-2013 - were H3N2 seasons.

In March, after the H3N2 vaccine strain was vaccine production was underway, health officials noted the appearance new and different strain of H3N2. 'This is not something that's been around before,' Frieden said.

But health officials weren't sure if the new strain would become a significant problem in the United States this winter until recently, they said. 

Lab specimens from patients have shown that the most commonly seen flu bug so far is the new strain of H3N2. Specifically, about 48 percent of the H3N2 samples seen so far were well matched to what's in the vaccine, but 52 percent were not, the CDC said.

An official with one vaccine manufacturer - GlaxoSmithKline - emphasized that about half the samples do match the strain in the vaccine. 

He also noted flu seasons can sometimes involve a second wave of illnesses caused by a different strain.

'We're at the very beginning of flu season, and it's quite possible different strains will predominate,' said Dr. Leonard Friedland, director of scientific affairs for GSK's vaccines business.

HOW BAD IS THIS FLU SEASON?

It's not clear yet. Experts worry this winter will be unusually bad because the nasty bug that's making most people sick isn't included in this year's vaccine. Preliminary data on how well the vaccine is working is still weeks away. Among infectious diseases, flu is considered one of the nation's leading causes of death, killing roughly 24,000 a year, on average.

HOW UNUSUAL IS FLU THIS YEAR?

The different flu strain makes predictions more difficult. The current season hit hard in December - earlier than usual. But the last two flu seasons hit early, too. So far, flu hospitalization rates are similar to the harsh season two years ago, which was dominated by a similar flu virus. Especially this year, health officials this year are urging doctors to treat flu patients promptly with antiviral medications.

HAS FLU BECOME EPIDEMIC?

Yes, but that's not unusual. 'It's safe to say we have a flu epidemic every year,' Jhung said Monday. Epidemics occur when a virus spreads quickly and affects many people at the same time. According to one CDC definition, flu is epidemic when a certain percentage of deaths in a given week are due to flu and pneumonia. By that measure, flu epidemics occurred in nine of the last dozen winters, including this one. Flu-related deaths surpassed the epidemic threshold three weeks ago, then dropped below that level the next week. But other measures indicate flu still is epidemic.

IS IT TOO LATE TO GET A FLU SHOT?

CDC officials say no. The flu season appears to be on track to peak this month, but even if it does, the flu will still be around for months. Despite the new flu strain, the vaccine has been well matched in roughly a third of the flu cases seen so far. And it is considered to be effective against some other flu viruses that could surge in the late winter or spring. About 40per cent of the public was vaccinated against flu as of November, which is about normal in recent years, Jhung said.
