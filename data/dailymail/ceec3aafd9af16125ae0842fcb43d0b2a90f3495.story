If sending rovers to Mars wasn't enough, Nasa now wants to send submarines to Titan.

The space agency has outlined plans to launch the huge structure to Saturn's largest moon by 2040.

Titan is unique in the outer solar system in that it is the only one of the bodies outside the Earth with liquid lakes and seas on its surface.

If sending rovers to Mars wasn't enough, Nasa now wants to send submarines to Titan. The space agency has outlined plans to launch the huge structure to Saturn's largest moon by 2040. Pictured is an illustration of what the submarine could look like

The Titanian seas, however, are seas of liquid hydrocarbons – and astronomers now what to find out what lies beneath.

Specifically, they want to send a submarine to Titan's largest northern sea, Kraken Mare.

Sprawling over 154,000 square miles (400,000 square km), and around 300 metres (1,000 feet) deep, Kraken Mare is comparable in size to the Great Lakes in North America.

Nasa's conceptual Titan submarine would weigh about one tonne (2,200 lb), and would use conventional electric propulsion over a 90-day mission.

Sprawling over 154,000 square miles (400,000 square km), and around 300 metres (1,000 feet) deep, Kraken Mare is comparable in size to the Great Lakes in North America. Titan's atmosphere is largely made up of nitrogen and methane at a pressure one and half times that of Earth's, and with a temperature of -290 °F (-179 °C)

Nasa says it plans to send the submarine to Titan using a winged spacecraft similar to US Air Force X-37.

The craft would survive hypersonic entry into moon' atmosphere, release the submarine, while its sinks to the bottom of the alien ocean.

Titan's atmosphere is largely made up of nitrogen and methane at a pressure one and half times that of Earth's, and with a temperature of -290 °F (-179 °C).

The space agency said the submarine would be driven by a 1kW radiothermal Stirling generator that would propel the craft and also prevent it from freezing.

'The vehicle would observe – and perhaps ultimately exploit - tidal currents in the sea, which follow a cycle once per Titan day, or 16 Earth days,' the researchers write in the design proposal.

Overall, scientists estimate the boat will be able to travel at one metre per second (3.6 km/h, 2.2 mph).

If Kraken Mare is as deep as estimated, it could cause the proposed nitrogen ballast tanks to could condense into a liquid, making the craft sink.

Nasa has planned for this, and says a piston would enable liquid to pass liquid in and out, rather than simply relying air pressure.

The mission would primarily look for traces of compounds that could give scientists a better understanding of how life began on Earth.

'We will investigate a full spectrum of oceanographic phenomena: chemical composition of the liquid, surface and subsurface currents, mixing and layering in the 'water' column, tides, wind and waves, bathymetry, and bottom features and composition,' said Nasa.

'Measurements of all these aspects of Titan's hydrocarbon ocean environment can only be made through focused in situ exploration with a well-instrumented craft.

Heliopause Electrostatic Rapid Transit System (Herts)A propellant-less propulsion concept for deep space 
missions. Herts is like an electric solar sail - it is an array of 
wires extending out up to 20 miles (30km) from a rotating 
spacecraft that would gather energy from the sun. It would be capable of 
reaching speeds more than 430 miles (700km) per second - and at top speed could
 travel from the sun to Neptune in a year.

Swarm Flyby GravimetryA method for working out the gravity and mass of small solar system bodies (such as asteroids and comets) using a swarm of small, low-cost probes (illustration below).

The Aragoscope: Ultra-High Resolution Optics at Low CostA giant disc that could boost the viewing power of space telescopes by up to a factor of 1,000.

Exploration Architecture with Quantum Inertial Gravimetry and In-Situ ChipSat SensorsSpacecraft-on-a-chip
 systems, ChipSats, would be deployed on other planets or moons such as 
Europa to perform science at reduced time and risk (illustration to the right).

3D Photocatalytic Air Processor for Dramatic Reduction of Life Support Mass & ComplexityA device to be used on manned spacecraft that could turn light from the sun into oxygen.

Wrangler: Capture and De-Spin of Asteroids and Space DebrisThis nanosatellite-scale sub-satellite, called the Weightless Rendezvous And Net Grapple to Limit Excess Rotation (Wrangler) System, will capture and de-spin a space object such as an asteroid using a large ‘net’, in tandem with a tether deployer and winch mechanism.

Titan Aerial Daughtercraft     A small rotorcraft weighing under 10kg (22lbs), not too dissimilar to small portable quadracopter drones on Earth, that would be deployed on Titan by a balloon to acquire close-up, high resolution imagery and mapping data of the surface.

Using the Hottest Particles in the Universe to Probe Icy Solar System WorldsA method to measure the ice depth on outer planet moons such as Europa, Ganymede and Enceladus using experimental techniques adapted from high-energy physics (illustration below).

Periscope: Periapsis Subsurface Cave Optical ExplorerA proposed method to map subsurface structure on the moon using a ‘seeing-around-the-corner’ imaging technique adapted from periscopes.

Mars Ecopoiesis Test BedA
 device for studying the survival of terrestrial life forms on the 
surface of Mars. It would take life from Earth and see if it can live on
 the red planet as a precursor to one day terraforming Mars.

Comet Hitchhiker: Harvesting Kinetic Energy from Small Bodies to Enable Fast and Low-Cost Deep Space ExplorationA tethered spacecraft that hitches rides on comets to tour the solar system. This would be done by firing a ‘harpoon’ with a tether attached that would reel the spacecraft in, like a sort of cosmic fishing rod (illustration below).
