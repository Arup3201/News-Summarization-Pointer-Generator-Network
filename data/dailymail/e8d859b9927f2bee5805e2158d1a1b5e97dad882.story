Most of us like to dab on a little perfume in the morning but, for most of us, the fragrance only lasts until lunchtime.

Now a jewellery brand has come to the rescue of those who hate carrying clunky bottles around, courtesy of a set of pendants and bracelets that emit fragrance.

Although OBO bijoux look like stylishly modern jewels, each pendant is actually a mini perfume bottle that can be detached from the chain and used in the same way as a roll-on scent.

While the perfume inside lasts no longer than a regular scent, around six hours, wearing it around your neck means no more carrying bottles around.

'The simple idea behind OBO is to apply perfume, anytime and anywhere,' explains designer, Julien Cohen, 29, from Paris.

'We wanted to make a beautiful accessory that can perfume your skin.'

Mr Cohen, who is currently running an Indiegogo crowd-funding campaign in an attempt to raise the money to put his big idea into production, hopes the product will find favour with busy women hoping to make their life a little bit easier.

And to ensure the final design is completely fool-proof, he has been conducting an extensive series of tests to rule out embarrassing spillages.

'The
 perfume is leak-proof and it has been tested under high 
pressures to ensure that our roll-on gives the same results as a classic
 pump dispenser,' he reveals.

The OBO range, which comes in a choice of black or white bracelets and necklaces, uses magnets to attach the perfume bottles to their chains and will cost between £49 and £57.

Once launched, the range will include eight different fragrances, which will be sold in sets of three capsules alongside the jewellery.

'We worked with the perfumers Amélie Bourgeois and Anne-Sophie Behaghel and they created eight unique fragrances,' adds Mr Cohen.

'Each piece of jewellery contains around 3ml of perfume which gives between 20 and 25 applications on the skin.'
