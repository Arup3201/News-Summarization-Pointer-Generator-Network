The doctor whose family were killed in a home invasion has become engaged to a woman who volunteered for a charity set up in their honour.

Dr William Petit, 55, got engaged last weekend to photographer Christine Paluf, 34, who volunteered for the Petit Family Foundation in Connecticut.

The memorial organisation helps educate young people, improve the lives of those with chronic illnesses and protect those affected by violence.

Dr Petit was beaten with a baseball 
bat and tied up during a 2007 invasion by two men in Cheshire, but he 
escaped to a neighbour’s house.

However his wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit 
was killed and their daughters - Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were 
tragically left to die in a fire.

The two men, Joshua Komisarjevsky and 
Steven Hayes - who blamed each other for escalating the violence - are 
on death row for the killings.

Prosecutors said it took both of them 
to carry out the killings in a crime so gruesome it was compared to 
Truman Capote's book ‘In Cold Blood’.

That was about the brutal murders of a Kansas farmer and his family.

'I miss my entire family, my home, everything we had together. They were three special people'

Hayes, convicted of raping and strangling Hawke-Petit and killing the girls, was sentenced to death last year.

Komisarjevsky, convicted of the 
killings and of sexually assault, was condemned to die last month but 
will be formally sentenced this month.

Dr Petit told a court he had seriously 
considered suicide many times after the deaths of his wife, whom he 
called his best friend, and their daughters.

He emotionally talked 
about his family. ‘I miss my entire family, my home, everything we had 
together,’ he said. ‘They were three special people.

'It's been very difficult. It's not clear to me that time heals all wounds, but you form some form of scars'

‘I lost my entire family. I lost the records of our shared lives together due to the fire. Thus I lost my past and my future.’

Dr Petit said when Komisarjevsky was convicted that he has had the ‘occasional moments of peace’ since the crime.

But he said the trial evidence brought back all the horror.

‘It's been very difficult,’ Dr Petit said. ‘It's not clear to me that time heals all wounds, but you form some form of scars.’

'We're really excited and pleased that they've become engaged. I think that they seem to be very compatible'

Marybelle Hawke

Mrs Hawke-Petit's mother, Marybelle Hawke, welcomed the news of Dr Petit's engagement.

‘We're really excited and pleased that they've become engaged,’ she said by telephone from Florida.

‘I think that they seem to be very 
compatible. We've got to know her quite well.’ Mrs Hawke said her family
encouraged him to find peace and joy in his life.

‘I see a great change in him,’ she 
said. ‘I think he'll have pretty good sailing from now on. We felt he 
was a blank person for a long time.’
