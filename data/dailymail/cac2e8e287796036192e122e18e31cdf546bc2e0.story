Justice: Tanilla Warrick-Deaves was brutally bashed to death in 2011 by her stepfather Warren Ross. Today the cowardly killer was sentenced to 40 years in jail.

Murdered toddler Tanilla Warrick-Deaves was forced to run laps until she dropped, hit, whipped and thrust under a cold shower before she was beaten to death by her stepfather Warren Ross.

And in heartbreaking detail, courts heard how Ross abused the cute and cheerful little girl because he thought she was taking too long to learn toilet manners.

Ross will spend at least 30 years behind bars after he was sentenced on Friday for the brutal murder of the two-year-old.

Ross, 31, was sentenced to a maximum 40-year term and will not be eligible for parole until September 2041, due to time already served.

Few would disagree with the severity of the sentence, with startling details about Tanilla's tragic and short life revolting many in the community as the case unfolded.

Warren James Ross killed his stepdaughter at their Watanobbi home on the NSW Central Coast in August 2011 after beating and torturing the defenceless toddler. His inexplicable and callous motive was apparently over Tanilla's tardiness with toilet training.

The 31-year-old whipped her with various implements including an electric cord and a belt, and deliberately dropped a heavy tool box on her tiny hand.

Tanilla's mother Donna Deaves watched as Ross inflicted the fatal injuries on her daughter.

Ross and Deaves had been in a relationship for about two months when he began hurting Tanilla.

Deaves was last year sentenced for at least nine years over Tanilla's manslaughter.

Ross was found guilty of the shocking murder last year, in a case that shocked Australians around the country.

During Friday's sentencing, Ross reportedly rolled his eyes and waved at family members while terrifying details of his late stepdaughter's final days were read out.

A packed court had to be controlled by public order and riot police as Justice Stephen Rothman handed down the lengthy sentence.

Neighbours reported hearing her screams as she was repeatedly punished inside her Central Coast home.

Judge Rothman said that Ross, high on marijuana, held Tanilla under a cold shower and told her 'You don't s*** in my house - you are an animal', before banging her head into the shower screen twice, ABC reported.

Justice Rothman said the toddler's death came as a result of 'severe corporal punishment' and that her killer had shown no remorse.

Despite the brutality and callousness of the murder, Ross was not handed a life sentence.

Tanilla's heartbroken father - who has his daughter's name tattooed on the inside of his right arm - earlier told the trial how her death had devastated him.

He said: 'There is not enough words to express this heartache and pain I feel every day since that morning,' according to the ABC.

'I can only imagine her final two days and the fear she had being hit, smacked, whipped, made to run laps till she couldn't stand no more, being held over the toilet and having the final blow with her head being hit in the shower.

'I have nightmares, sleepless nights, things will never be the same.'

When today's sentence was read out, the mother of Warren Ross exclaimed: 'I'll be dead. What about the kids?'.

Earlier, Ross mouthed and gestured at Tanilla's father Adrian Warrick as the court heard the child killer had been bashed inside jail because of the cowardly murder.

Ross shouted 'see ya later Adrian' as he was led out of the dock to begin his four decades behind bars.

The judge ruled that the murder was not premeditated and therefore not in the most serious category of killings.

He added: 'No person with a modicum of humanity could fail to be moved by this murder.'
