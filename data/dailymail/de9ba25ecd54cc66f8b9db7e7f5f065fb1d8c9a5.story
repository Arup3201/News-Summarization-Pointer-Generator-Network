Two passengers aboard a flight in China have been jailed after opening the plane’s emergency exit doors in protest at a lengthy delay.

China Eastern Airlines flight MU2036 travelling from Chengdu to Beijing was already seven hours behind schedule at 3:45am on Saturday morning because of snow when crew began to de-ice the plane at the Kunming airport.

Passengers were initially told the flight, scheduled to take off at 8.45pm, was being delayed until 11pm. However, the plane was only cleared for take-off around 3.17am, according to local news sources.

The plane was taxiing on the runway when a man named  reportedly opened three emergency exits

Passengers were said to have become angry when the plane's ventilation system was turned off for 30 minutes during de-icing work to prevent fumes from entering the cabin.

Although the co-pilot had been dispatched to explain, passengers remained irate even after the plane left the gate and members of a tour group started arguing with the crew, according to police.

The plane was taxiing on the runway when a man named as Mr Zhou reportedly opened three emergency exits to prevent the plane from taking off and forcing it to return to the gate.

According to state broadcaster China Central Television, a total of 25 passengers out of the 153 onboard — all part of a single tour group — were held for questioning while the rest continued on to Beijing aboard a separate flight.

Kunming police said in an online statement that Mr Zhou and a tour guide named Li have been placed under 15-day ‘administrative detention’ for opening the doors.

An investigation has been launched and the names of all those found to have been involved would be placed on a ‘national uncivilised traveller record’, administration spokesman Zhang Jilin said in a statement.

Names can remain on such lists for up to 18 months, during which travel agencies can decide whether or not to accept them on trips.

China's fast growing air travel market is the world's second biggest, but heavy traffic and tight military control of airspace have given it the world's worst record for flight delays.

Cancellations, delays and service complaints spark frequent incidents of air rage at airports and aboard flights, including those to and from foreign destinations. 

Brawls between passengers and attacks on crew are often filmed and posted online.

Saturday's incident was the latest in a growing number of air rage cases involving Chinese travellers.

Last month, a China-bound Thai AirAsia flight was forced to return to Bangkok after a female Chinese passenger threw hot water on a flight attendant amid a heated argument between her boyfriend and the cabin crew over service.

Also in December, a brawl involving three women erupted on a Chinese flight from to Chongqing to Hong Kong yesterday when two of them complained to a mother that her baby was making too much noise.

Days later, a passenger on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu yanked open a door shortly before take-off to ‘get some fresh air’.

Last year the government released a lengthy list of do's and don'ts aimed at turning Chinese travellers into ‘civilized tourists’.
