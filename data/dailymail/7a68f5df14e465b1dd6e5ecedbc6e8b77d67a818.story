Expect the installation of a transfer hotline at The Hawthorns after this display. Tony Pulis wants new players, and he wants them now.

The security blanket his presence on the touchline has cast over West Bromwich Albion in four unbeaten games was whipped away by a Tottenham team operating at their optimum.

Christian Eriksen was majestic. Harry Kane even better. Mauricio Pochettino has his players drilled and decisive right now. They were too much of an attacking force for West Brom and this match effectively over inside 15 minutes.

This first defeat under Pulis was greeted by boos. He knows his side must improve but whether that is on the training pitch or in the transfer market remains to be seen.

What he would pay for a player like Kane, though. Prior to kick-off, he was clear about his admiration for the striker heading for senior England honours. Saido Berahino, his own player with hopes of a call from Roy Hodgson, has a ‘long way to go’ to reach Kane’s standard, the head coach said.

Kane’s brace killed off Albion as the Spurs star took his tally to 20 goals for the season — one more than Sergio Aguero. No Premier League player has more.

Another wonderful free-kick from Eriksen set the platform for victory. Four times in 16 games he has scored a decisive goal in the 87th minute or later. Here though, the Denmark international was on target as early as the sixth minute.

When Claudio Yacob fouled Mousa Dembele 25-yards out, Eriksen set his sights and sent his shot arcing over the wall and past Ben Foster.

Kane scored his first goal nine minutes later. He swept inside Andre Wisdom with ease from the left and smacked his finish past Foster before the England goalkeeper had time to extend his arms. West Brom were lacklustre but sprang to life midway through the half.

Pochettino had Hugo Lloris to thank for keeping the gap at two. Victor Anichebe broke at speed and passed to James Morrison, who bent a brilliant shot that was heading for the top corner until Lloris stretched a hand to tip over. Soon afterwards, a free-kick routine involving six West Brom players saw Berahino eventually cut back for Yacob to strike. Again Lloris reacted sharply.

Craig Dawson rattled the bar four minutes before the interval, meeting Morrison’s deep free-kick with a fine header, and it appeared West Brom would make a fist of a comeback in the second period.

It was not to be. In the 64th minute referee Kevin Friend pointed to the spot after Kyle Walker’s cross hit Joleon Lescott on the arm. Kane stepped up and sent his penalty just inside the left-side post at pace.

Pochettino said the top four was within reach for his team. ‘If we perform like today, then maybe — we need to be consistent,’ he said.

He also stressed he wanted Kane to sign a new contract. ‘Harry wants to stay at Tottenham and Tottenham want Harry to stay a long time.’

The away fans went through their repertoire of songs as the match wore on. The hosts were neutralised and their fans started slinking out well before the final 10 minutes.

Pulis said: ‘We started sloppy and gave the ball away too much. This week’s been difficult. I’ve been busy. I’ll be happy as long as we’ve brought in a few players.’
