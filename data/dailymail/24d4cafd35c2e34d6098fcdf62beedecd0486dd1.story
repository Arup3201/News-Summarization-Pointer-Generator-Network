This video shows the shocking moment a police officer punches a man in the face while struggling to handcuff him on the pavement.

Two officers pinned the unknown 23-year-old suspect to the ground when he attempted to resist by raising his head.

As he did so a male officer is seen to land a blow, with an open palm, on his face before saying: 'You spat at one of my colleagues once, you will not do it again.'
