The Adelaide father charged with allegedly stabbing his three-year-old son to death has been captured on video being handcuffed by police as paramedics tried to revive the boy nearby.

David Janzow is now recovering from surgery in at the Royal Adelaide Hospital after stabbing himself in the neck following the alleged attack on his son Tuesday.

Police said there was nothing in the 34-year-old's past that would have pointed towards him being charged with allegedly murdering his son, with no obvious history of domestic violence.

David Janzow was arrested on Tuesday after allegedly stabbing his three-year-old son to death in Adelaide

On his landscaping business website, Neighbour Labour and New Landscapes, the director and landscape planner is described as 'pretty awesome boss to work for'.

The business' website said he completed a Bachelor of Environmental Management at Flinders University in 2001, and later Project Management, Irrigation and Garden Design.

'At 6 foot 6 [he] is a sensational basketballer and was a DJ in a past life,' it said.

'The company's longevity is testament to his talent and hard work.

'Dave throws [a lot of] dedication and initiative ... into the development of his company and the management of his staff, which makes him a pretty awesome boss to work for.'

But Tuesday's events paint a very different story of Janzow.

He has been charged with the murder of his son after he went missing from the family home in Stepney, in Adelaide's eastern suburbs, and will face a bedside court hearing today, The Advertiser reported.

Janzow, who is the director of Neighbour Labour and New Landscapes, is described as an 'awesome boss'

Janzow is recovering from surgery in at the Royal Adelaide Hospital after stabbing himself in the neck following the alleged attack on his son Tuesday.

The boy's mother rang police at 8.25am on Tuesday morning saying her husband had taken their son from their Stepney home and she had concerns for their welfare.

About 9am, South Australia police were at an unrelated crash scene at the intersection of Hockley Terrace and Gorge Road in Athelstone, in Adelaide's northeast, when they were  approached by a man claiming he had injured his son.

Police allegedly then found the boy suffering multiple stab wounds in Janzow's four-wheel-drive ute and he was rushed to the Women's and Children's Hospital.

The boy died at the hospital as a result of his injuries.

Superintendent Graeme Adcock said the man's black Volkswagen Amarok has been impounded by police.

'We're fairly confident the actual vehicle was the actual crime scene,' he said.

A SA police officer called it a 'tragic set of circumstances' while briefing the media earlier on Tuesday

He said it was too early to say whether mental health issues were involved in the tragedy.

'It is an absolute tragedy that a little boy has lost his life in these circumstances,' Superintendent Graeme Adcock said.

'We are in the very early stages of the investigation, so I am limited in what I can say.

'However, I can confirm that an autopsy will be carried out tomorrow to determine the exact cause of death.'

The Eastern Adelaide Local Service Area officer-in-charge said the boy's wounds were consistent with being stabbed.

Superintendent Adcock said the 36-year-old - who was charged on Tuesday afternoon - remained in hospital and would undergo surgery for serious but non-life-threatening injuries to the neck.

'Police are unable to interview him until 24 hours after surgery,' he said.

'Understandably, the boy's mother is overcome by grief and police have not yet been able to take a statement from her.'

Superintendent Adcock added the mother would receive every possible support available from police.

'At this stage of the investigation, there is no indication of any history of domestic violence. However, we will continue to examine that as the investigation progresses,' he said.

Police say the boy was attacked at a home in Stepney before being driven 8km away to Althelstone

The boy was taken to the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide 

Police have said everyone who was involved in the incident were deeply affected by it.

'It's a tragic set of circumstances and our sympathies go out to the family,' a SA police spokesman said earlier on Tuesday.

'It was also a difficult incident for the police and the ambulance officers.'

Police said they did not know the man's final destination and the family was not known to them.

Anyone who may have seen the man's black Volkswagen ute heading from Stepney to Athelstone on Tuesday morning is urged to contact police.

Earlier on Tuesday, Gorge Road between Ryan Avenue and Coulls Road was closed to traffic due to the incident.

A Gorge Road business owner - who did not wish to be identified - said the area had been 'crawling' with police officers all morning.

'No one really knows what happened,' he said.

'It's just been one of those days that happens anywhere in the world and today it's happening in Athelstone.'

Eastern Adelaide police and Major Crimes are investigating the incident.
