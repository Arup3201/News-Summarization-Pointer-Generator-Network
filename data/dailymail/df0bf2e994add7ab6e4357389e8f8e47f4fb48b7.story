The Little Couple star has released a new picture showing her in a hospital bed as she receives chemotherapy treatment.

Jen Arnold, the matriarch of the TLC reality show, has taken the opportunity to thank her own mother as she goes through treatment for a rare form of cancer.

'My parents have been a great support during this challenging time! Love them! @judy_arnold,' she wrote as her lookalike mother posed beside her in the hospital bed.

Grateful: Jen Arnold posted this photo to her Twitter account alongside her mother during chemotherapy treatment

The neonatologist-turned-reality star has been actively updating her fans about her health over social media ever since announcing the diagnosis in December, shortly after she and her husband brought their second adopted child to their home in Texas.

Dr Arnold and her husband both have dwarfism due to a genetic condition, and her cancer diagnosis came after she had already been very open about their fertility struggles.

In addition to posting photos of her adorable toddler Will, she regularly updates about how '#ChemoSucks' and the victories of accomplishing everyday tasks like taking down the Christmas decorations.

An initial setback came when her chemotherapy had been postponed for a week because of low blood counts, but said the 'silver lining' was that she was able to have 'a better Xmas' with her family.

Updates: Arnold has been very open during her illness and updating her thousands of fans often

She certainly made the most of it, baking cookies with her son Will, 3, and daughter Zoey, 2, while her husband Bill Klein cooked an Italian feast for Christmas Eve.

She also shared pictures of her boy enjoying his presents on Christmas morning.

Arnold, who has been wearing a wig, detailed the terrifying moment that she learned something was wrong in an interview withÂ  People magazine.

'There are moments I feel just terrible,' she told the publication. 'I can't believe it is happening. Other times, I feel like this is just a bump in the road.'

The couple adopted son, Will, from China and they were in India to bring home their new daughter Zoey in October when Arnold began bleeding.

Desperate to stay with her daughter but feeling increasingly faint, Arnold made the difficult decision to return home.

Once back in the U.S., she was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcincoma, a cancer sparked by a non-viable pregnancy she had suffered.

Her fertility issues have been well documented on the show, and she was shocked when she became pregnant in August - although she said she was not surprised that an ultrasound showed the baby had no heartbeat.

'I had figured it wasn't going to be viable,' she told People magazine.

The embryo was removed but cells were left behind and sparked the quick-growing cancer. She began intensive chemotherapy while her husband was still in India.

But the mass in her uterus failed to respond to the chemo and grew four times its size - and then three tumors appeared in her lungs.

'Sometimes I think, "Seriously? Really? How can this be happening?"' she told People.

Doctors were forced to give her a hysterectomy - which they saw as their last resort because of Arnold's small airway.
