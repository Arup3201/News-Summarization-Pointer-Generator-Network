With a group that includes Uruguay and Italy, it might have been England's best chance of winning the World Cup.

But customs officers have thwarted more than 1,000 shots at glory - by seizing boxes rammed full of fake trophies at a warehouse in China.

The 1,020 statuettes were found in the city of Yiwu, Zhejiang province, which has among the busiest export trades in the world.

The fakes, which from afar bore a remarkable resemblance to the real thing, were due to be exported to Libya.

The General Administration of Customs of China launched a campaign in April to crack down on football-related copyright theft ahead of the tournament in June.

Brazil's World Cup is expected to make huge sums in merchandising, and China has a valuable dog in the fight: its factories have manufactured a million versions of the official armadillo mascot.
