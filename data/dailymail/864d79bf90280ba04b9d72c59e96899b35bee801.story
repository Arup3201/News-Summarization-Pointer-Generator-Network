A 79-year-old Minnesota man is in tears after learning that his $24 million yacht caught on fire in the Chula Vista boat yard on Thursday.

Larry Jodass, 79, a retired electrical engineer, entrepreneur, and the former chairman of a semiconductor company was heartbroken after watching footage of his beloved yacht the 'Polar Bear' burn to ash in footage posted online.

'It was my toy, my wonderful, beautiful 
piece of equipment. I think it’s the most beautiful boat that ever has 
been built,' Jodass told NBC.

A yacht in San Diego, California, went up in flames on Thursday, and a drone caught the dramatic scene on video

The yacht's owner and its builder, Larry Jodass, 79, wants answers as to why his precious boat caught fire in the shipyard where it was undergoing repairs

The $24 million dollar beloved yacht of Larry Jodass was only in the water for three years before it was engulfed in flames

Jodass told reporters that he isn't 'angry' about what happened but that he's devastated to lose the beautiful yacht that took him five years to build.

Jodass told NBC that the yacht has been in the water for three years and that it was dry docked in Chula Vista after he took his boat on a winter vacation in Costa Rica.

The vessel broke into flames at around 9:15 on Thursday morning at the dry dock in the 900 block of G Street.

Smoke filled the air and dispatchers warned fire crews that there was a lot of fuel on board the boat which put the vessel at risk for an explosion.

Fire fighters hosed down the flaming vessel from all directions.

Because a yacht is built to keep out water, the fire team's effort did little to quell the monstrous flames.

All that remains of the 'Polar Bear' is a charred skeleton after it mysteriously caught fire on Thursday

The boat had a top of the line renovated control station and had only been on the water for three years before it was destroyed

Police were compelled to use high powered rifles to open the yacht so that the water could enter and calm the fire.

The shipyard was evacuated as a per-caution and luckily the other boats did not catch fire.

A Hazmat team, a group of personnel specifically trained to handle dangerous materials, was also brought to the shipyard.

Now burnt and broken, the remains of the 'Polar Bear' don't even vaguely resemble the once opulent luxury vessel.

The boat was once equipped with a large master bedroom with a widescreen television and the bathroom housed top of the line marble counter tops.

'The beautiful part with this piece of equipment was that no matter who looked at it, it was like, "Wow, how in the hell could you have a boat like that? “'Jodass told NBC.

Officials are still investigating the cause of the fire but confirmed that a welder was working on the boat at the time that it caught fire.

Jordass wants answers and told reporters he will continue to pester the shipyard until he gets some kind of explanation.

'I don’t have enough data to make any positive or negative comment as to why somebody who’s doing their job obviously didn’t get it done because it would not have caught on fire,' he added.

Jodsass said the fire took something away from him that he truly loved and valued and he wont stop asking questions until he gets answers and hopefully an apology. 

'Do I love that boat? It’s a helluva boat, I just think it was wonderful, I enjoyed it tremendously and I think it was worth the money that I put into it,' he wept as he remembered the 'Polar Bear' in all its glory.

The boat's interior resembled that of an upscale home and was approximately 110 feet in size

The boat housed luxury amenities like this master bedroom with a widescreen television
