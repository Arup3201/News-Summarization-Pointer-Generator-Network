A 50-year-old man tested negative for Ebola in New York City on Thursday evening. 

The man, who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, was taken by ambulance to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan to undergo tests for the deadly virus. 

The man had returned from Mali in West Africa this weekend and attended the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn on Monday with alleged flu-like symptoms but was sent home.The man called 911 on Thursday morning saying his condition had worsened and was rushed to Bellevue Hospital.

He will continue to have further tests despite having a negative diagnosis.

'Because in early Ebola Virus Disease initial tests may be negative, the patient will have further Ebola tests in the coming days to confirm today’s negative result,' the Health Department said in a statement Thursday evening, reports CBS. 

It is unclear if he was asked about his recent trip to West Africa when sent home on Monday or offered information that he had traveled to Mali.

Interfaith Medical Center provided a statement to MailOnline on Thursday.

'This morning, the New York City Department of Health notified Interfaith Medical Center that an individual was seen on Monday, November 17th by his private physician in the physician’s private office located on the hospital’s campus and that the individual was taken today to Bellevue,' it read.

'Interfaith has put in place all policies, procedures and protocols required by the New York City and State Departments of Health for all New York hospitals to protect patients and staff and has been following up with Bellevue and appropriate authorities as warranted in these circumstances.' 

On Thursday, the man reportedly called 911 and after an emergency responder was alerted that the man had recently been in West Africa, New York City's Ebola precautions were implemented.

He was being cared for at Bellevue Hospital where his test results are pending.

A statement from the New York Department of Health said: 'An individual who came to the United States from Mali, a country with limited Ebola transmission, was taken to HHC Bellevue hospital Center today.

'Due to the individual’s travel history and symptoms, the patient has been isolated, and an Ebola test will be performed. Results are expected later today,' said the statement this afternoon.

Mali is not one of the countries in the Ebola 'hot zone' which covers Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

But according to a WHO update this week, in Mali there have been six reported cases of Ebola of which five people have died. 

On Wednesday, the Health Department confirmed that a woman, who recently returned from Guinea and dropped dead in a New York salon with blood pouring from her nose and mouth, did not have Ebola. 

Last week, Dr Craig Spencer was declared free of Ebola at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan after contracting the virus while treating patients in Guinea.

He was the first, and only, case of Ebola to date in New York City.
