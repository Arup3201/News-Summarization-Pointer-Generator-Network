It has been dubbed a NASA experiment, a spy device and a giant film projector by curious onlookers.

But the massive silver cantilevered platform hanging from the 28th floor of the luxurious $2 billion One Central Park in Sydney is none of the above.

It is actually a feature of a one-of-a-kind 110-tonne steel heliostat - a device used to reflect sunlight to another area.

This massive silver cantilevered platform hanging from the 28th floor of One Central Park in Sydney has been described as a NASA experiment, a spy device and a giant film projector by curious onlookers

The feature, designed by One Central Park architect Jean Nouvel and PTW Architects, serves two purposes, Fairfax Media reports.

It's an architectural design element and an engineered way to reflect light into the dark corridor beneath it. 

Frasers Property director Paul Lowe says the silver feature, which has been completed for about a year, still gets compared to a NASA experiment and a dream light-box.

'We believe the heliostat is unique to a residential structure - it is probably the only one we know of in existence here or around the world,' he said. 

But the glittering feature is actually part of a one-of-a-kind 110-tonne steel heliostat designed to redirect light into the dark corridor below

The almost glittering feature has 220 reflecting mirrors positioned underneath a platform to redirect light into the retail section, pool and communal areas below. 

The cantilever's upward facing side has a garden built in. 

One Central Park is a 38-floor glass building that hosts a range of shops and residential apartments, which currently start from about $800,000.

It boasts 1,120 square metres of vertical garden made up of 35,000 plants, including 250 Australian native species. 

They are watered through a drip-irrigation system and are able to grow without soil due to being attached to a water-soaked felt and mesh base

One Central Park took out the top gong at the Council on Tall Building and Urban Habitat awards late last year when it was named  the Best Tall Building Worldwide.
