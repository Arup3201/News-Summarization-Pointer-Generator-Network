A woman has told of a horrifying rape ordeal that took place at the hands of former Oregon State University football players over 16 years ago - but no one believed her.

Brenda Tracy, 40, from Oregon, has bravely come forward to detail a chilling account of how she reported the rape to police, saying that she was sexually assaulted in 1998 by four men, three of them college football players. 

She said she was gang raped, sodomized, robbed, and then re-victimized.

But a college football coach only suspended two of the players for one game and was quoted as saying his players had made ‘a bad choice.’

Tracy reported the gang rape to police in 1998. She'd told investigators the men stood around, watching it happen and cheering the others on.

Speaking out: Brenda Tracy, 40, from Oregon, has bravely come forward to detail a chilling account of how she was brutally raped and sodomized 16 years ago 

At one point, she said she begged one of the men to make it stop but they didn't.

The men who were accused of her rape were young at the time, and one was a teenager. 

Two Oregon State football players, defensive back Calvin Carlyle, 18, and running back Jason Dandridge, then 20, were named as suspects in the report. 

The other suspects were Michael Ainsworth 18, a Southern California high school football recruit and Nakia ‘Ken’ Ware, a 23-year-old community college defensive back who was on probation. 

Tracy, a mother-of-two said the ordeal was so harrowing that she wanted to commit suicide afterwards.

She told The Oregonian: ‘I'd decided I was going to kill myself.'

Speaking through tears, she told how she underwent a rape examination at  Salem Hospital.

Jenenne Stanley, the on-duty emergency room nurse at Salem Hospital that day, told investigators, ‘By all indications this was a case of non-consensual sex.’  

She was also humiliated into having to relay the details of the event to her boyfriend and mother.

She has never before been identified as the victim and has never before talked publicly about it.

Suspects: Michael Ainsworth, 18, left, was a Southern California high school football recruit. Nakia 'Ken' Ware, right, was a 23-year-old community college defensive back, was on probation for armed robbery in California

Accused: Oregon State running back Jason Dandridge, left, was 20 when he was identified as a suspect. Oregon State defensive back Calvin Carlyle, right, was 18 when he was named as a suspect 

In 1998, Brenda Tracy was 24 years old and working as a waitress. The petite blonde with shoulder-length hair, standing at 5 feet 10 inches and weighing only 140lbs, was a single mother to two boys, ages 4 and 5.

‘I had victim written all over me,’ she said. , 

She had suffered childhood abuse up until the age of 5, then domestic abuse as she got older at the hands of former boyfriends and attracted the wrong sort of man.

She remembers wearing a turtleneck in the summer once to cover bruising on her neck after being choked by a boyfriend.

‘My self-esteem was gone,’ Tracy said. ‘I didn't think I was worth anyone really loving me.’

A 28-page report by Corvallis Police Department details the events of the early morning hours of June 24, 1998, when Brenda Tracy's life changed.  

The report outlined a weekday late-night excursion from Keizer to Corvallis by Tracy and her best friend, Karmen McFadden, who were supposed to meet up with her boyfriend and a group of friends.

But instead of a fun get-together, the petite woman ended up naked, in various degrees of consciousness, on the living room floor with men taking turns raping her. 

Afterwards, none of the four suspects asked for legal representation. However, all were read their rights and each blamed the other.

They also blamed alcohol for the night's events at Carlyle's No. 3 apartment on Northwest 20th Street for what happened to  Tracy. 

The suspects told police the 24-year-old vomited in the restroom, asked to be left alone and said ‘No,’ at different points in the course of the seven-hour ordeal.

Tracy recalls waking up with someone pouring alcohol down her throat and her clothes tossed around.

Suicidal: Tracy, a single mother of two, said she was on the brink of ending her life after her assailants got off with only a slap on the wrist from OSU 

She said she was assaulted with a flashlight and digitally penetrated, and someone put ice on her groin.

Tracy told investigators that she woke up at another point and found Ainsworth on top of her having sex with her. 

The others, she said, were standing around the room, cheering. She told police she heard someone shout, ‘Yea dog!’

Yet Ainsworth told police he took Tracy's clothes off and had consensual sex with her. 

He said he didn't understand why Tracy would believe she was violated, despite admitting that the other men  in the room had violated her, he said, ‘Yea, but I know I didn't.’ 

The other players mostly denied involvement in the rape.

Carlyle initially denied any sexual contact with Tracy, but he later admitted to police that he'd touched her body and participated in brief oral sex.

Ware also denied having any kind of sexual intercourse with Tracy. He told police he put on a condom at one point and asked Tracy to have intercourse with him, but she declined. 

Dandridge, who knew Tracy from a local nightclub, told police the entire event was ‘a risky situation.’ 

Police obtained a search warrant for the house and found five used condoms in a bathroom wastebasket, alcohol bottles and a bag of marijuana. They also took DNA samples, including hair and fibers.

‘I remember not being able to move my arms and legs,’ Tracy said. 

‘I've always wondered if I was drugged. I was like a rag doll. They were picking me up and tossing me around the whole apartment.’

But Tracy's toxicology report the following day came back negative for drugs.

When it was all over, Karmen McFadden found a naked Brenda Tracy asleep on the floor under a blanket.

She told police she looked outside the window and saw Ware and Ainsworth stealing money from Tracy's car, which they later returned,

When Tracy woke up, she got in the car and drove home, sobbing the whole time. She called her mother and asked her to get off work and come to her.

Upon arriving home, Tracy's mother found the 24-year-old woman weeping on the couch in a fetal position.

All four suspects were arrested and booked into the Benton County Jail on charges of sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration and sex abuse.

Ware and Ainsworth were also slapped with the additional accusation of rape. If convicted, they would have faced up to 16 years in prison, meaning that their release date would have been this year. 

At the time, District Attorney Pete Sandrock had a solid case on his hands, with copious amounts of evidence, witnesses willing to testify and four suspects pointing fingers at one another, but what he did not have was Tracy's cooperation. 

Tracy was hesitant to set the rape case in motion, in part because her boyfriend was a former OSU football player who was afraid that the explosive allegations would cause embarrassment to the entire college community.

OSU head football coach Mike Riley suspended two of the men for one game and was quoted as saying they had made 'a bad choice' - a remark he now regrets making 

To complicate things further, Tracy's friend Karmen McFadden was dating rape suspect Michael Ainsworth's older brother and believed that Tracy was not entirely blameless.

‘What happened to me was not my choice,’ Tracy said. ‘What they did to me was not my choice. They violated me. I was garbage to them.

‘I'd made my mind up after talking to police that I was going to do the rape examination, then I was going to go kill myself. I was going to commit suicide.

‘I was already dead.’ 

Looking back on her decision, Tracy said: ‘I wish I'd have pressed charges.’

She added that she feels sick to her stomach that the men only got a slap on their wrist by Oregon State head coach Mike Riley.

‘I get sick of reading articles about how great a guy the coach is,’ she said. 

Tracy's ordeal was widely publicized 16 years ago, but opinion on what took place was divided, with some supporting her and believing her version of events, while others questioning it. 

When interviewed by The Oregonian about Tracy's rape, coach Mike Riley expressed ambivalence about his own response to the allegations made against his players.

‘It's so sad to me that it still haunts her. It's scary what that means to a lady,’ Riley said . ‘Maybe retribution would have helped that. I don't know.’

He also said he regrets the 'bad choice' remark, which has been haunting Brenda Tracy for 16 years.

One of the accused former players, Calvin Carlyle, went on to become an investigator for the US Department of Labor after a brief stint with the NFL. He is married and has three children.

He told The Oregonian that he hasn't given much thought to 'that crazy stuff' that went on in an apartment in Corvallis 16 years ago, but added that Tracy's decision to dredge up the past has left him feeling 'humiliated.'

After playing football for a short time for Canada’s Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Jason Dandridge moved out to California, where he now works as a personal trainer. He also has three children.

Michael Ainsworth excelled as a freshman playing football for Berkeley in 1998, but he got swept up in an NCAA investigation into academic fraud and dropped out of college a year later.

Public records show that Nakia Ware allegedly violated a restraining order in 2005 and convicted the following year of a domestic violence charge.
