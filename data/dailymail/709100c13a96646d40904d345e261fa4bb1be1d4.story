Fans who have long wondered what went through author J.K. Rowling's mind when she wrote the first Harry Potter novel now have their chance to find out.

And now the author's own annotated copy of the first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is to go under the hammer for charity.

The book contains Rowling's handwritten 
thoughts and commentary about the book and the film adaptation and includes 22 illustrations of its scenes and characters.

JK Rowling's personally annotated first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is due to be sold at the Sotheby's in aid of the writers' association English PEN. On the title page she has added: 'changed my life forever', and drew the Hogwarts crest where it went on to appear in later editions. She also questions: 'Perhaps Hufflepuff house would have the respect it deserves from fans if I'd stayed with my original idea of a bear to represent it?'

On another page, Rowling has drawn a picture of a sleeping baby Harry left on the Privet Drive doorstep of the Dursleys, his aunt and uncle, after his parents were killed by Lord Voldemort

The book is one of 51 titles annotated by their authors to be sold at auction in aid of writers' association English PEN at Sotheby's in London on Tuesday.

It includes a 43-page 'second thoughts' segment from Rowling, with notes such as, 'I wrote the book ... in snatched hours, in clattering cafes or in the dead of night.

'For me, the story of how I wrote 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' is written invisibly on every page, legible only to me ...'

Other contributions include copies of Roald Dahl's Matilda, Phillip Pullman's Northern Lights and Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary.

Dr Philip W. Errington, director of printed books and manuscripts at Sotheby's, said: 'This can undoubtedly be regarded as the definitive copy of any Harry Potter book.

'Not only is it a fine copy of a first edition of the first book, but the author has significantly personalised it with numerous written comments and many impressive and evocative illustrations.

'The personality of the author leaps from these pages and we are treated to a remarkable insight into her creative genius.'

In one of the annotations, Rowling adds the words 'changed my life forever' to the book's title.

Only 500 copies of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone were printed in its first run. Now author JKRowling has provided the annotated first edition for a charity auction at Sotheby's this week

On the chapter entitled Quidditch, Rowling's notes explain the sport's origins: 'was invented in a small hotel in Manchester after a row with my then boyfriend. I had been pondering the things that hold a society together, cause it to congregate and signify its particular character and knew I needed a sport. It infuriates men, in my experience (why is the Snitch so valuable etc.), which is quite satisfying given my state of mind when I invented it'

She also questions whether a badger to 
represent Hufflepuff, one of the four houses at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry where Harry studied, was the right choice.

Rowling writes: 'Perhaps Hufflepuff would have the respect it deserves from fans if I'd stayed with my original idea - a bear to represent it?'

Among the edition's 22 hand-drawn illustrations is one of the orphaned baby Harry wrapped in blankets and left on his auntie and uncle's doorstep with a note from Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore explaining that Lord Voldemort had killed the child's parents, James and Lily.

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
was first published in June 1997, and is the rarest of the series as 
only 500 copies were printed. One copy sold for Â£19,700 at auction in October 2007.

After the first book was published in June 1997, the Harry Potter series went on to sell more than 400million copies worldwide.

It was transformed into a blockbuster film franchise starring Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, and Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

Rowling became what Forbes magazine described as 'the first billion-dollar author'.
