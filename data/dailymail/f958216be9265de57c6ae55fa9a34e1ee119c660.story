A teenager who killed a father-of-three after causing a crash while texting and driving was found guilty today and sentenced to a year in prison.

Aaron Deveau, who was 17 at the time of the collision, was given the maximum sentences for motor vehicle homicide and causing serious injury while texting after he drifted across the central line and hit the other driver's car head-on last year on February 20.

Daniel Bowley Jr, 55, suffered serious injuries in the crash in Haverhill, Massachusetts before dying in hospital 18 days later.Â

District Court Judge Stephen Abany told the small but packed courtroom he wanted to send a message to all drivers with Deveau's sentence. The teenager had earlier said he wished he could 'take it all back'.

Although he noted the teenager's youth and lack of criminal record, the judge nevertheless ordered him to spend a year at the Essex County House of Corrections. Deveau, who has been out on bail after being sentenced in 2011, was taken into custody.

According to the Boston Globe, the judge said: 'People need to keep their eyes on the road, keep their eyes on the road.'

The family of the late Mr Bowley cried and clung to each other in the courtroom after Deveau was sentenced.

Mr Bowley's girlfriend Luz Roman, who survived the crash, wept with relief. She had earlier told the court: 'This has been giving me a lot of pain, there are no words to describe. Broken leg, broken heart.'

Mr Bowley's sister Donna Burleigh also spoke to the court about the 'tragic and unnecessary' loss of her brother.

Phone
records showed that Deveau sent and received 193 texts during the 
course of the day when he fatally crashed into Mr Bowley, a father of 
three adult children.

Mr Bowley had just attended church with Ms Roman and the two were driving to their favorite spot for a relaxing walk when they were hit.

Deveau had earlier insisted to the court that he was not texting at the time 
of crash and could not remember sending messages while driving.

Deveau was given concurrent sentences of
two-and-a-half years on a charge of motor vehicle homicide and two 
years for a charge of negligent operation of a motor vehicle causing 
serious injury while texting. His license was also suspended for 15 years.
