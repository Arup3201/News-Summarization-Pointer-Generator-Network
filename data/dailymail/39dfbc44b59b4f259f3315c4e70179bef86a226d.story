Tammy Gregory, 36 (pictured outside Reading Crown Court today) is accused of having sex with the underage boy at her home in in August 2013

A mother-of-three had sex with a 14-year-old friend of her daughter when he went to her house after spending an evening drinking vodka, a court heard.

Tammy Gregory, 36, appeared at Reading Crown Court today accused of having sex with the underage boy at her home in Reading, Berkshire, in August 2013.

The court heard how the schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, arrived at Gregory's three-bedroomed house in the early hours following an evening out with her daughter and friends.

Christopher Hewertson, prosecuting, told the jury that at about 2am or 3am the boy went to bed in Gregory's room, while his friends went into her young sons' room.

The jury was shown the footage of a police interview with the schoolboy, who said that while Gregory's daughter went to bed in her own room, he went to sleep in the master bedroom.

The court heard that the group had been drinking until about 2am and when the boy awoke in the double bed later that morning, Gregory, then aged 33, was in the bed next to him, wearing her pyjamas.

The jury was told they then started kissing before having full sex.

In the police video, the boy said: 'It was like 3am in the morning and she [Gregory's daughter] went to her room.

'So then I just went into her [Gregory's] bed. She was not there.

'I woke up, I don't know what time, it was light and she [Gregory] was there.

'We just started kissing and it happened. I pulled down her pyjama bottoms. We wasn't (sic) speaking.

'I stopped kissing her and pulled my shorts down and we had sex. I didn't say anything.'

When questioned by Mr Hewertson, the boy admitted he had been drinking vodka on the night in question, mixed with fizzy drinks.

Mr Hewertson told the jury of five men and seven women: 'The sexual activity takes place at the defendant's home address.

'There is no dispute that the victim was 14-years-old at the time. He had had his 14th birthday exactly a week before.

'Clearly alcohol was consumed.

'He wakes up close to dawn at which stage he is aware the defendant has got into bed with him.

'They roll over and face one another. There is a period of kissing. He, in effect, rolled on top of her. [It] led to full sex.

'It was full sexual activity, consensual and deliberate between the victim, aged 14, and defendant, clearly an adult.'

Mr Hewertson told the jury that the question they had to answer was whether the pair actually had sex or not.

'He says squarely that they did and she says squarely that they did not,' he said.

'The prosecution says this is not some kind of figment of imagination, made up by him. There is no motive. It is simply his frank position.

'She deliberately, and we say significantly, had sex with him underage.'

The court heard how Gregory allegedly engaged in 'full sexual activity' with the schoolboy, who is a friend of her daughter. The pair are said to have had sex after he went to her house after drinking vodka with friends

The schoolboy denied in cross-examination that he was lying about sleeping with Gregory and insisted she had joined him in bed and had sex with him.

However, John Barker, defending, suggested that the boy had arrived at Gregory's three-storey home very drunk.

He claimed that the boy had vomited in the back garden before being put to bed in the bedroom of Gregory's two young sons after she and her daughter cleaned up the mess.

Mr Barker said that at some point during the night, the boy went into Gregory's bedroom and told her he felt unwell so she got him a glass of water and allowed him to sleep there.

'You were drunk and sick,' he suggested.

'You went to bed and were shown to the boys' room. Shortly after that you got up and went into Tammy's room.

'You complained that you were feeling sick and she brought you some water and you stayed there and fell asleep on top of the bed covers.'

The boy denied that version of events, claiming he had gone to bed and had awoken to find Gregory beside him.

Mr Barker accused the boy of lying about having sex with Gregory to his friends.

'Did you say to them "I slept with Tammy",' he asked.

'Is that how all this started? You lied to your friends?'

However, the boy denied that he had lied and said: 'Why would I lie to them?'

Gregory, 36, denies one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and insists the teenage boy was drunk and went to her bed and fell asleep. The trial at Reading Crown Court (pictured) continues

Mr Barker said Gregory's daughter had persuaded her mother to let the boy stay because he was so unwell.

'You were puking and she took pity on you,' he said.

'She persuaded Tammy to let you stay. She [Gregory] put you to bed soon after you arrived. She looked after you, got you a drink, talked to you for hours.'

The boy denied that was the case and added: 'If I was lying, how would me telling two of my friends end up with me sitting here two years later?'

The court heard that the boy's mother found out about the alleged incident through friends and confronted Gregory at her home before reporting it to police.

Mr Hewertson said the boy did not feel like a victim.

'He, in many ways, despite being a child, doesn't consider himself really a victim in the archetypal sense,' he said.

'It is because he was fairly participating in the act.'

Gregory denies one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

She insists that she was in bed on the night in question and that the boy came to her room drunk where she comforted him before he fell asleep.

The trial continues.
