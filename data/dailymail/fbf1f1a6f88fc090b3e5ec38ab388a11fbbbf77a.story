Like a cowboy riding a bull, a daring frog enjoyed his own rodeo on a beetle - and stayed atop the insect for five minutes even as it tried to fly away.

The adventurous flying frog leapt atop the black beetle and even put its front leg in the air in a bid to keep its balance.

Photographer Hendy Mp captured the strange antics near his house in Sambas, Kalimantan Barat, in Indonesia.

Giddy up! Photographer Hendy Mp captured this daring frog hop a ride on a beetle and it even stuck its front leg in the air cowboy-style

King of the rodeo: The flying frog managed to stay atop the woodboring beetle for around five minutes before eventually crawling off

Risky business: The photographer, who captured the off antics in Sambas, in Indonesia, said the frog stayed on even as the beetle took off

He said the green and orange frog, pictured grinning widely, stayed on the beetle even as it began 'taking off'. 

The 25-year-old said: 'It was such an amazing moment, the frog just saw the beetle and decided to crawl on top.'

He added the frog stayed on the beetle for around five minutes before eventually crawling off. 

'It looked like the frog was a cowboy riding a bull and it even put its right leg in the air.

'The frog was on the beetle for five minutes and the insect was just happily running around.'

The frog, a Reinwardt's Flying Frog, is native to Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, and is classed as a near threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
