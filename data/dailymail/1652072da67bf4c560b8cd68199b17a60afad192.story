These are the first pictures to be released of a man who was found buried in his back garden with his wife after they were ‘shot dead by their daughter and son-in-law’.

The remains of William and Patricia Wycherley were recovered from the garden of their home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire last October following a tip-off to police.

Their daughter Susan Edwards, 56, and her husband Christopher, 58, are due to go on trial at Nottingham Crown Court tomorrow charged with their murder between May 1 and 5, 1998.

The remains of William and Patricia Wycherley were recovered from the garden of their home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire last October. They disappeared in 1998 but it did not come to light until a tip-off last year

Today, Nottinghamshire Police released a picture of Mr Wycherley as a young man before he moved to Mansfield and of him prior to his death in the late 1990s. Officers said they had so far been unable to trace a picture of Mrs Wycherley.

The Wycherleys disappeared from their home in Blenheim Close, Mansfield in 1998.

Police launched a murder investigation
 after two sets of human remains were recovered from the back garden of their semi-detached house last October.

Post-mortem examinations showed both had been shot.

Nottinghamshire
 Police said DNA testing had formally identified the remains as those of
 Mr and Mrs Wycherley, who would have been 85 and 63 respectively at the
 time of their death and 101 and 80 if living today.

Susan and Christopher Edwards were arrested at St Pancras International station in London on October 30 last year.

The pair, of no fixed address, both deny murder and the trial is expected to last up to four weeks.
