Baseball fans are among the most loyal in sport - and Derek Jeter can spot a true Yankees supporter from a mile away.

Or, as was the case in Houston on Thursday night, see through the demanding punters to the genuine ones.

The Yankees captain faced a tough task during the game against the Houston Astros this week, with one Astros fan desperately trying to grab a baseball he was giving away at the end of the inning.

Jeter had clearly already decided the souvenir would go to a young girl in the stands, however he had to repeatedly yank it away from a woman in the front row as he tried to hand it to his patient devotee.

Finally the over-eager woman gave up - or realized that the ball was not going to her - and the little girl claimed her prize, according to The Bleacher Reporter.

Fittingly she was was wearing a Jeter jersey, a Yankees cap and had a sign in her hand.

The Yankees beat the Astros 4-2.

The game was Jeter's last opening day of his career, with the legendary 39-year-old player set to retire at the end of the season.

The ball that was given to the girl will soon be worth a lot of money in terms of memorabilia.
