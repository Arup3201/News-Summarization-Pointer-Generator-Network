Michael Schumacher's 15-year-old son has crashed while test driving a Formula 4 car at 100mph in east Germany.

Mick Schumacher was racing through the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, when he skidded out of control and onto the gravel, it was reported.

The young protege began karting seven years ago, and this year reached the German Formula 4 - the racing category used as a stepping stone by junior drivers.

However, German newspaper Die Welt reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured.

His father, who is still recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races.

Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4 earlier this month.

At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.'

Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season.

His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September.

He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend.

Philippe Streiff, a former Formula 1 driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'.

However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend.

'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said. 'He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation.
