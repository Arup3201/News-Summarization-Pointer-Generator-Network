Jo Heywood said too many parents are failing to communicate with young children, instead filling their homes with digital devices to 'keep them quiet'

Primary school children are now speaking like toddlers because their parents are 'pacifying' them with iPads instead of talking to them, a private school head mistress has warned.

Jo Heywood said too many parents are failing to communicate with young children, instead filling their homes with digital devices to 'keep them quiet'.

She said the problem, which happens 'across the social spectrum', was ultimately stunting children's speech development.

And when they enter school aged five, some 'cannot even talk', with the communication skills of a two or three-year-old.  

Mrs Heywood said that while her pupils arrived well-prepared at Heathfield School, a boarding school for girls in Ascot, many other children across the country were suffering.

She said: 'You only have to spend a few hours watching parents or carers in any high street in this land to see how addictive and time consuming mobile technology is for them.

'I frequently see parents with prams juggling their childcare duties with texting or browsing the internet and having virtually no communication with their baby or toddler.

'Bottles or dummies are shoved into their mouths to keep them quiet or mobile phones or iPads into their hands as soon as they can hold them and play with the bright lights.

'There is no social barrier to the parents I see doing this. This is a digital not a class issue. iPhones and iPads have become the new pacifiers.'

In a conference speech for Policy Knowledge in London last week, Mrs Heywood stressed the importance of instilling basic skills at an early age.

She said that without that foundation, children will grow into adults unable to read a newspaper, a book, a recipe or simple instructions.

She pointed out that there are currently 'thousands of men and women in this country who struggle with literacy levels barely above that of a five year old child.'

And she added that there were many teenagers in today's secondary schools who lack the basic English and maths skills to enable them to study other subjects like science.

The problems is being made worse by today's '24/7 media culture', which has caused the 'disengagement of some parents from rearing their children'.

She added: 'Many parents are unconcerned because they do not see the value of reading a book themselves when information is so readily available on a smartphone.

'I am sure I am not the first to remark on the fact addiction to smartphones is doing the opposite of making children smart.

'Many are living in households where parents are hooked into their mobile phones or internets without speaking to them and they are given uncontrolled access to digital devices to keep them quiet.'

She said it was a problem for children from both disadvantaged backgrounds and well-off homes, especially when parents work.

'So the end result is that thousands of children are entering a primary school system with the communication skills of a 2 or 3 year old instead of a 4 or 5 year old,' she said.

'Some of them cannot even talk let alone be in a position to learn to read via a phonics system, many teachers have reported. This puts even more pressure on a primary system which is geared towards helping children read and write in the early years.'

Mrs Heywood's £30,000-a-year secondary school celebrated a record year in 2014 with over half of all the exams taken awarded the highest A*-A grades.

She said that while pupils arriving at Heathfield had all been well-educated in basic literacy and numeracy skills, they were easily distracted by tablet devices.

She said: 'The simple fact is that the brain does not go into a deep learning zone if it is switching between tasks.'
