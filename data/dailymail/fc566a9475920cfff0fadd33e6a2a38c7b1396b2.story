Libraries should pay authors a fair sum each time they lend out an e-book or writers will go bust, a leading novelist claimed today.

Philip Pullman, best-selling writer of the His Dark Materials children's fantasy trilogy, says authors could lose up to two-thirds of their income and even be forced to give up writing altogether if hard copies of books in libraries are replaced by e-books.

A new reporty by the Society of Authors, of which Mr Pullman is President-elect, warns: 'There is a risk that e-books have the potential to undermine the perceived value of books generally to a point below which [writing] ceases to be commercially valuable.

'The risk is even higher with e-lending.'

Author Philip Pullman says writers must be paid fairly when e-books of their work are borrowed from libraries

As President-elect of the Society of 
Authors, Mr Pullman is leading a campaign to force publishers and the 
Government to make sure writers are paid properly when electronic 
versions of their work are borrowed from public libraries.

E-books are a growing trend, with consumer sales up more than 130 per cent last year.  The Society of Authors estimates that more than half a million e-books were lent out through libraries in the first 10 months of last year.

But, the society says, authors are not seeing income from that stream.

Under the current royalty system, authors are paid about 6p by the Government each time a paper version of their book is borrowed from a library, but paid nothing when a e-version is borrowed.

The society has also discovered that publishers may be unintentionally underpaying writers for e-book loans, meaning they could be losing out twice over.

Mr Pullman said: 'New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting, for all kinds of reasons, but one principle remains unchanged: authors must be paid fairly for their work.

'Any arrangement that doesn't acknowledge that principle is a bad one, and needs to be changed. That is our whole argument.'

The society, which was founded in 
1884 and has more than 9,000 members, says publishers must reimburse 
writers who have been underpaid, with interest on what they are owed, 
and ensure that publishing contracts are correctly interpreted so 
writers are paid what they are due in future.

It also wants the Government to ensure e-books are covered by the Public Lending Right (PLR) scheme.

In a report out today, the society says most authors - for whom the average wage is £12,000 - already 'struggle to make ends meet', adding:

'Advances have fallen while more unpaid work is expected of authors in marketing and publicising their work, including appearances and use of social media.'

The report adds: 'PLR provides a significant and much-valued part of many authors' incomes...It amounts to a total of around £6m per year.'

Anne Sebba, chairman of the society's management committee, said: 'Authors are keen to embrace the opportunities offered by digital publishing and want to support libraries by offering their eBooks for lending.

'However, we need to ensure that authors are paid sufficient money from digital to enable them to keep writing.'
