She was given just three months to live after a stranger pointed out an unusual mole on her shoulder.

But twelve months after being diagnosed with stage four melanoma- a terminal condition- Emma Betts is still healthy and determined to make a difference, chronicling her journey through her blog.  

After being given the initial diagnosis, Emma said that she spent a lot of time 'googling young people with melanoma and trying to find other people's stories' in an attempt to figure out what was happening to her.

'Most of them just said "I went to treatment and then this happened', but I wanted something blunt and honest,' Emma said.  

Emma decided, somewhat nervously, to start her own blog, Dear Melanoma, in order to document her daily struggles and start 'a conversation about cancer'.  

Covering everything from the plans she has for her death, her support for the 'dignity to die' cause, and her fear of leaving her new husband, Serge, behind, her blog offers a raw and honest account of living with cancer. 

'While it's tough writing the posts and I get quite upset, seeing the comments and reading how it has impacted people makes me feel like I'm actually doing something for myself, as well as other people,' Emma said. 

'I see it almost as a job, it's therapeutic, being honest about showing the really tough side of things that people don't want to admit to,' she said.

After being given the news that the cancer had spread into her liver and many of her other major organs, making her cancer inoperable, Emma's life changed dramatically.  

Having gained access to a clinical trial for a new immunotherapy treatment, Emma began seeing her tumours shrink, and then stabilise, which she said is both positive and negative. 

'I had an appointment with my oncologist and she was so excited, because she never thought I'd make it this far,' Emma said.

'But for me, the year mark has been met more with fear than with excitement, because people who take the drug normally respond for 22 months,' she said.

'It's already been a year and so every day I'm here I have to ask, how long until it stops working? It means that life isn't normal.  Everything is now taken into consideration,' she said.

In March 2013, Emma married her husband Serge, who she met just as she began her treatment.

'He got thrown into the deep end. I think lots of people wondered why we were getting engaged as we weren't sure I would live to see my wedding, but we've been through more in the past year than some people do in a lifetime,' she said.

'He was pretty amazing to have signed up for this. But it means that every decision we make now involves cancer.'  

'Serge was pretty amazing to have signed up for this. But it means that every decision we make now involves cancer,' said Emma

Emma said she is doing small things to make herself happy, like having fresh flowers in the house

'The days that are good are the ones where I reach a goal. Serge and I moved our wedding forward because we weren't sure I'd be alive, but I was fine,' Emma said

For Emma, part of this is writing her blog, an outlet which has now become a driving force in her life and has allowed her to be both candid and realistic in her writing. 

'I would happily give up everything that I hoped for my future just to be able to grow old. I don’t need to have children. I don’t need to have a career. I just need to be alive,' she wrote in her most recent post. 

'I know that this will kill me, we just don't know when. There are good days and bad days, but the cancer is always there,' Emma said.

'The days that are good are the ones where I reach a goal. Serge and I moved our wedding forward because we weren't sure I'd be alive, but I was fine,' she said.

'My next goal was my birthday, and then seeing my nephew born, and then Christmas. And now I'm just living one day at a time,' she said.

Emma said she was determined to find small ways to live a life that was good.

'My goal was my birthday, and then seeing my nephew born, and then Christmas. And now I'm just living one day at a time,' Emma said.

'I really struggled writing a bucket list because all the things I was writing down, like having children or a career, or travelling, I couldn't do,' Emma said.

'They were all things I couldn't have, and so everything on my list are everyday luxuries. Fresh flowers in the house, eating pavlova if it's on a cafe menu, drinking wine and champagne and not just saving it for a special occasion,' she said.

'I wanted to bring a bit of happiness in my life that wasn't dependent on a doctor saying yes or no.' 

Emma said she is now hoping to use her story to fund research for clinical cancer trials, and is hosting a fundraising event for the Melanoma Institute of Australia.

'It's so important to raise money for the trials, because it gives people like me more options. Once the drug stops working, you want to jump onto the next and the next one to gain more time,' Emma said.

'What my life looks like for next little while is tough because I don't know how long life is,' she said.

'Serge and I aren't planning too far in advance, just spending lots of time together and enjoying each other as it comes.'
