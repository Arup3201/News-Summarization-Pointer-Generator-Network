Flint, Michigan has America’s highest murder rate. It also
shares a zip code with a wealthier less crime ridden area called Grand Blanc Township.

Grand Blanc Township officials are disputing the U.S. Postal
Service's decision not to allow parts of the 48507 zip code to be ‘Grand Blanc’
instead of Flint, according to the Journal.

Grand Blanc officials believe sharing a zip code with Flint
forces businesses to pay higher insurance rates due to Flint’s high crime rate.

Business Insider reports Flint’s murder rate is 62 per
100,000 people compared to 3.8 per 1000,000 in New York City. In addition to
having a high crime rate, Flint is very poor.

According to city-data.com, 38 per cent of residents live
below the poverty line. Its Median income was also less than $28,000 in 2009.

Grand Blanc Township is doing a little better with a median
income of $59,000 compared to $45,000 for the entire state of Michigan.

Flint wasn’t always so destitute. In the mid-1900s it had a booming
auto industry after a 1936 auto strike began an era of Union labor. GM employed
80,000 Flint workers in 1978.

In the 80’s GM set up factories in Mexico and by 2006 GM
only employed 8,000 people. Flint’s lack of a major industry caused poverty
rates to soar and people to leave.

Now in Flint Michigan, unemployment rates soar even for law
enforcement officials. This lack of authority lends to Flint’s crime rate.
There were only 122 police officers in 2012 down from 265 officers five years
ago. That’s only one officer for every 830 people.

Drug use has also increased in Flint. Heroin use has
increased in people aged 18-29 as reported by The Flint Journal in 2011.

Flint also has a reputation of being a dangerous place for
women. There were 66 homicides against women in 2012 and an 87-year-old woman was raped
outside of her home in the middle of the day.

As the going got tough, Flint residents got going. There
were 125,000 people living there in 2000, but that number declined to roughly
101,000 by 2011. This population decline demonstrates Flint is no longer a
place where people want to live.

Rob O'Lynnger, owner of Maplebrook Village Apartments in
Grand Blanc, told the Flint Journal that unlike Flint, Grand Blanc was an
attractive place to live.

‘We have a lot of families here and when people are deciding
where they want to live, school district is important to them,’ O'Lynnger told
the Journal. ‘We're proud to be part of Grand Blanc and we want residents to
know we are a part of it.’

'We wanted to do everything we can to protect and
attract businesses,' said Grand Blanc Township Supervisor Micki Hoffman

The 48507 ZIP code includes parts of Grand Blanc, Mundy and
Flint townships, as well as a southern part of Flint.

Officials call the shared zip code 'confusing' and bad for the township's economic health.
