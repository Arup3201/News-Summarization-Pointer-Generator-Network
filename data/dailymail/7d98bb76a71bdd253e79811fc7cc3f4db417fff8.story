A married couple have transformed a decrepit toilet block into a trendy ice cream parlour.

Mandeep and Jagbir Sidhu, both 36, spotted that the old toilets were for sale - and paid £180,000 for the whole block.

The dedicated couple then spent all their time and effort ripping out urinals, sledge hammering toilets and piling heaps of bricks into skips.

Makeover: Mandeep and her husband Jagbir   forked out £180,000 pounds for the block, and spent almost a year doing it up

Now nearly a year later they are now filling sundae glasses rather than skips after the parlour in Brockenhurst, Hampshire, opened last weekend.

The former public conveniences - in the centre of the village - had been derelict for more than seven years.

But after the transformation, customers can now purchase homemade Italian gelato and freshly ground coffee from the new parlour called Melt.

The couple noticed the old toilets were for sale and felt they would be perfect to house their dream business

The owners hope to attract students from the nearby Brockenhurst College as well as villagers and tourists who want an alternative to a pub.

Among the menu items designed to tempt visitors are homemade cakes, waffles and sundaes.

The couple say the parlour has been themed around a rustic-style ice cream parlour but with a modern twist and aims to appeal to people of all ages.

Mr Sidhu, from Southampton, Hants, said: 'If you went back in time to what it was, you would never believe what it has become.

'It has come a long way because it is such a drastic change of use.'
