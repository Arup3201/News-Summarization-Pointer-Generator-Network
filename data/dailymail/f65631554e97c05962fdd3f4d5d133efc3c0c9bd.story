The last eight days have provided a portal into Liverpool’s future and while there is some cause for encouragement, there will also be cause for concern.

Not before time, there has been news of Anfield’s expansion, the addition of 8,500 seats, something the club have long required if they are to remain among the elite.

But here, for the second time in little more than a week, was a view of life at Liverpool without their talismanic captain, the player who remains the heartbeat of this club.

With an important Champions League game against Basel coming next, not to mention a trip to Manchester United next Sunday, Brendan Rodgers made a sensible decision in starting with Steven Gerrard on the bench on Saturday.

When, however, the result of that is a performance much like their display against Stoke the previous weekend, when Rodgers decided he needed to start resting 34-year-old Gerrard for certain games, there is sure to be a heightened sense of anxiety.

In fairness to Rodgers and his players, their football improved before Gerrard was unleashed from the bench in the second half against Stoke that concluded with a winning goal from Glen Johnson.

But there was a lack of urgency in that first-half display that was evident again here, and a lack of authority in the midfield area Gerrard so likes to command. Until he came on in the 66th minute, Liverpool were unimpressive, although credit should be given to a Sunderland defence well organised by Gus Poyet.

The home side were tentative when they should have been attacking with real intensity, fearful of what Sunderland might do to them when they should have had the confidence to be crushing their visitors.

If Rodgers thought his players had shown great character to respond as they had after their dreadful defeat at Crystal Palace, and he said as much in his programme notes, there was little sign of it during this encounter.

It clearly worries supporters who were strangely quiet until Gerrard came on as a replacement for Adam Lallana. They can see it too. They can see how Gerrard almost single-handedly raised the tempo of Liverpool’s play, just as they can see the size of the task facing Rodgers: the need to identify new leaders now that Luis Suarez and Jamie Carragher have gone and Gerrard could be leaving too if he decides against signing the new contract he has been offered.

Even though Gerrard was unable to inspire a goal that would have secured a third successive league win for Liverpool, Rodgers acknowledged the need to find players who can fill the void in his captain’s absence.

‘It is very hard to replace that quality,’ said Rodgers. ‘You see that pass when Stevie first came on; not too many in the whole league could play that, that quality. He still has that talent, he has world-class ability and that is something of course we will need.

‘But we can’t always rely on Stevie. His talent is world class but that contribution has to come from the team. It can’t be up to him every single game to be the catalyst. He was excellent when he came on and of course he plays on Tuesday.’

Liverpool are lacking in other areas too. They have scored just seven league goals at home this season — only Aston Villa and Burnley have inferior records — and that owes much to the absence of Daniel Sturridge.

But what they really missed was any stature in midfield, which was something Sunderland clearly tried to exploit.

At times Liverpool’s back four almost buckled, with Martin Skrtel forced to make a desperate challenge to deny the advancing Connor Wickham. Sunderland’s appeals for a penalty were ignored, which looked just about fair enough.

Liverpool responded with a purposeful attack down the right flank, Rickie Lambert meeting Adam Lallana’s cross with a header that flew only narrowly wide.

And it was not long before Liverpool threatened again, with Philippe Coutinho unleashing a low shot that finished up in the side- netting.

But it amounted to a fairly uninspiring first half, with Liverpool creating just those two chances.

The second half started much like the first had concluded, with Sunderland showing more energy and determination until Gerrard injected fresh impetus into Liverpool.

The home side were better then, for sure. Coutinho unleashed two reasonable efforts, the second of which forced a fine save from Costel Pantilimon after a terrific run from Raheem Sterling, who then felt he should have been awarded a penalty after a challenge by Wes Brown.

It would have been harsh, and it was not even mentioned by Rodgers afterwards. But then he had wider, more significant concerns.
