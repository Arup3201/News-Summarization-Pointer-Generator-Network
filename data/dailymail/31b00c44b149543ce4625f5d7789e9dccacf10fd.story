Rising levels of obesity have forced hospitals to spend thousands of pounds on facilities to accommodate heavier people – including wider mortuary doors.

Some NHS trusts have had to buy sturdier beds, chairs that can stand weights of up to 50st and even winches to help lift patients who are severely overweight.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show hospitals in Greater Manchester have spent £167,000 on the extra equipment and modifications in the past three years.

Increasing weight: Hospitals in Greater Manchester have spent £167,000 on extra equipment and modifications for patients who are severely overweight in the past three years

Tameside Hospital had to widen its mortuary doors at a cost of £2,270, while Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust racked up a total bill of £97,000.

Stockport NHS Trust has seen its spend on apparatus for obese patients more than double in the past two years – spending £15,000 in 2013.

The majority of the cash was spent on 
hiring beds, hoist chairs and commodes for obese patients, which set 
them back £53,558 in 2011/12, after which the trust started buying their
 own equipment.

The Trust 
put £31,240 towards hiring more sturdy beds over the last three years, 
as well as another £10,350 on bariatric chairs, cushions and commodes.

Bolton NHS Trust bought a commode and two chairs that can stand weights of up to 50 stone as part of a £19,750 spend on equipment suitable for obese patients over a two-year period.

The Christie paid £18.95 for a walking stick as part of a £4,371 spend on bariatric equipment, and Tameside spent a total of £3,916.25.

A spokeswoman for The Christie said; ‘We remain committed to providing the very best standards of treatment and care for our patients.

'Purchasing equipment like this walking stick ensures we can provide personalised care to help improve the patient experience.’

Peter Denton, manager at HealthWatch Tameside, a patients’ group, said: ‘It’s the way the population is now unfortunately.’
