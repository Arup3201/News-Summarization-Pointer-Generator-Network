A nationwide collapse in house prices has led to the widest ‘North-South’ divide since records began, research revealed yesterday.

Prices have fallen in every region since the peak in 2007, with property values in Northern Ireland crashing by 53 per cent.

But falls in the North have been far greater than in the South.

House prices have plunged by up to 53 per cent since the peak in 2007, with the North, Wales and Northern Ireland dominating the worst hit areas

To live in the South, you have to pay a premium of nearly £100,000 on the price you would pay in the North, according to the Nationwide Building Society.

At present, a home in the South costs an average of £231,245, compared to £135,340 in the North.

The news comes a day after the Mail revealed that a lavish property with 25 acres of park land, a clock tower,  stables and servants’ quarters in the Durham village of Rushyford has sold for just £241,000.

In contrast, the average home in the West London borough of Kensington and Chelsea costs more  than £1million.

Growing divide: Prices have fallen nationwide (left) but the north has suffered more than the south. Average house prices in the north of England have slipped from 70 per cent to 59 per cent of average southern England prices since 2005 (right)

Nationwide said house prices have 
fallen in every single region of Britain since the peak, but some 
regions have been far worse affected than others.

Overall,
the Nationwide's figures show house prices have more than halved since 
2007 in Northern Ireland, but typically dropped by between 10 to 15 per 
cent in other regions.

Prices
are down only 1.9 per cent in London, but 9.7 per cent in the South 
West, 11.1 per cent in East Anglia, 14 per cent in Yorkshire and the 
Humber and 16.1 per cent in the North West.

Robert
Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide, said the jobs market was 
crucial to the future of house prices. If unemployment rose sharply, 
they were likely to fall further.

'Labour market developments will remain of paramount importance in deciding the trajectory of house prices,' he said.

‘There
are grounds for caution on this front as the unusual combination of 
rising employment and declining economic activity that was evident in 
the first half of 2012 is unlikely to be sustained.’

The
figures highlight the nightmare facing homeowners who bought their 
property five years ago, and have seen its value collapse. Many are 
trapped in negative equity, which means the size of their mortgage is 
larger than the current value of their property.

Overall, national house prices peaked in October 2007 at £186,044. Today the average price is £163,964, down 11.9 per cent.

Ed
Stansfield, chief property economist at the consultancy Capital 
Economics, said: ‘It certainly seems as though the housing market is one
area where there is precious little evidence of ‘green shoots’.

‘Given
the fragile nature of the economy, the huge squeeze on real incomes and
offsetting impact of ultra-low interest rates, this gradual downward 
drift in house prices makes sense.’

Mark
Harris, chief executive of the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, 
said it is vital the Bank of England’s new £80billion Funding for 
Lending scheme to help homeowners works.

He
said: ‘There is already much debate as to whether it will help those 
borrowers who really need assistance. We need cheaper mortgages for 
people with smaller deposits.’

For
example, the Halifax yesterday launched a two-year fixed rate mortgage 
with a rate of just 2.44 per cent, but you need a 40 per cent deposit. 
The fee is £1,995.

But, if 
you have a deposit of only five per cent, the rate will typically jump 
over six per cent for a two-year fixed rate deal, or over four per cent 
with a 10 per cent deposit.
