The German-made camera that was used to take one of the most iconic pictures of the 20th century has sold for almost $150,000 at auction.

Photographer  Alfred Eisenstaedt used the Leica Illa rangefinder to capture the image of a sailor kissing a mystery nurse as he celebrated Japan's surrender at the end of the Second World War.

The camera was expected to sell for about $30,000 but fetched five times that amount at the Westlicht auction house in Vienna.

Iconic: Photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt's image of an impulsive sailor kissing a woman he did not know in New York's Times Square to celebrate Japan's surrender in 1945, became one of the most iconic of the 20th century. The Leica IIIa rangefinder he used sold for $150,000

Mr Eisenstaedt, a German-born Jew who was forced to leave his homeland when the Nazis came to power, was in New York's Times Square on August 14, 1945, when Japan's surrender was announced.

He started photographing an impulsive sailor in the square as he kissed passing women in celebration.

The image of the sailor and the young nurse in a passionate clinch became a world-famous symbol of the V-J Day festivities.

Mr Eisenstaedt continued to use the camera until his death in 1995, including for a photo shoot with President Bill Clinton.

The
only defect on the camera, which was a successor to the groundbreaking Leica I, is a small dent on the underside of the camera, which 
resulted from the photographer dropping it which carrying out an 
assignment.

The photograph of the kiss, a 17.5x12in print 
bearing Mr Eisenstaedt's signature on the back, also exceeded its estimate when it went under the hammer.

It was expected to make about $22,000 at auction but sold for almost $31,000.

However, the historic camera was not the most expensive sold at the auction on Saturday.

A gold-plated Leica III 'Luxus', which had been passed down passed through the family that owned German sparkling wine company Henkell, sold for $682,366.

German
firm Leica, founded in 1913, distributed thousands of cameras during 
the Second World War - but nearly all of them went to the Nazi side.

The company made a 'Luftwaffe' model for the German air force but at the same time as supplying the Nazis, staff at the company helped Jewish employees flee the country.

The Leica III series helped pave the way for the small hand-held cameras which became commonplace in the 20th century.

It was one of the earliest 'rangefinder' cameras, which allowed photographers to measure the distance between them and their subjects in order to make sure their pictures were in sharp focus.

The IIIa was first made in 1935, and represented an advance on its predecessors by allowing photographers to use a shutter speed of just 1/1000 seconds.

Mr Eisenstaedt 
bought the camera when he was living in Germany, before emigrating to 
the U.S. at the age of 26 in 1935 as the Nazi government became 
increasingly oppressive towards the Jews.

Before
his departure, he photographed senior Nazis including Adolf Hitler, 
whom he snapped during a meeting with Benito Mussolini, and Joseph 
Goebbels, who is scowling in his photograph - apparently because he had 
just discovered that Mr Eisenstaedt was Jewish.

After settling in the Jackson Heights neighbourhood of Queens in New York City, he became a staff photographer for Life.

Mr Eisenstaedt's work appeared on 90 covers of the magazine, showcasing stars such as Sophia Loren and Ernest Hemingway.

He was awarded the National Medal of 
Arts by George H.W. Bush at a White House ceremony in 1989, and in his 
old age took a series of intimate photographs of the Clinton family on 
holiday.

However, his most famous work remained the iconic picture of the sailor and the nurse.

The
first Leica prototype was built by the company Ernst Leitz in Wetzlar 
in 1913,  but it was not until 1925 that the firm produced its first 
commercially available camera.

The
small, portable cameras became quickly popular, and established Leica's
reputation as one of the world's leading photography companies, which 
it remains today.

Like 
many German firms, Ernst Leitz co-operated closely with the Nazi 
government in the 1930s and 1940s - Goebbels encourage citizens to use 
its cameras to produced idealised depictions of the Aryan race.

However, behind the scenes the company was working to save its many Jewish employees by helping them leave Germany.

Ernst
Leitz II set up what would become known as the 'Leica freedom train', 
sending workers to its offices overseas to allow them to escape the 
racist Nuremberg laws within Germany and start a new life in Britain, 
France or the U.S.

Leitz
never talked about his heroic deeds, which were brought to an end by 
the onset of war in 1939, but Jewish groups have recently paid tribute 
to his altruistic attitude.

The identity of the two people in the
photograph is not entirely clear, but they are widely believed to be 
George Mendonsa and Greta Friedman.

In
1979, Edith Shain wrote to Mr Eisenstaedt  claiming she was the woman 
who was kissed, but experts later claimed she was too short to be the 
person depicted.

However, when Life magazine asked the
subjects of the photograph to step forward, a total of three women and 
11 men claimed to be the kissers.

An examination of the sailor's scars 
and tattoos soon suggested that Mr Mendonsa was the man, and he 
identified Ms Friedman - who was a dental hygienist - as the woman.

The sailor was at the cinema with a 
date when news came of the Japanese 
surrender, and he says he kissed the woman because he considered her 
uniform showed she was part of the war effort.

Mr Mendonsa's date, Rita Petry, would
later become his wife - she has since said she did not mind the 
passionate embrace, which took place right in front of her, but added: 'In all these years, George has never kissed me like that.'

Ms Friedman played down the significance of the kiss in later years, saying: 'It wasn't that much of a kiss. It was more of a jubilant act that he 
didn't have to go back [to fight in the Pacific].'

She also paid tribute to the upbeat atmosphere in Times Square on VJ Day: 'All throughout the day and the evening, people were there. It was like New Year's Eve, only better!'

And
she had no idea she was being photographed when the stranger grabbed 
her - she was just anxious to get back to her job at the dentist's
