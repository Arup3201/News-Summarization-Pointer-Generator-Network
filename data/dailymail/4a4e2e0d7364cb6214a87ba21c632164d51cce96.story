Protests have turned violent in Berkeley, California after demonstrators hit the streets for the second consecutive night to speak out against the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York.

A crowd of 750 protesters swarmed freeway overpasses at two locations in Berkeley, near San Francisco, prompting police to move in to clear the roadways and handcuff some protesters.

Three officers and a technician were hurt and six people were arrested.

Some protesters hurled objects at police, who responded by firing gas, the California Highway Patrol's Golden Gate division said on
its Twitter feed.

It said demonstrators threw unspecified 'explosives' while protesters targeted them with rocks and bottles and tried to light a patrol vehicle on fire.

Some demonstrators said on Twitter that police had fired
rubber bullets, but this could not be confirmed.

West Coast cities had braced for trouble after clashes in 
nearby Berkeley and Seattle, Washington on Saturday.

Protesters
in New York and other cities have staged demonstrations every
day since a grand jury's decision on Wednesday not to bring
criminal charges against the white police officer whose
chokehold contributed to the man's death in New York in July.

Saturday's looting and rock-throwing on the West Coast
contrasted with the mostly peaceful demonstrations that have
taken place elsewhere. New York was quieter over the weekend.

The killings of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown,
an unarmed black teen, in Ferguson, Missouri, have highlighted
the strained relations between police and African-Americans and
rekindled a national debate over U.S. race relations.

The decision by a grand jury not to return an indictment inBrown's killing ignited two nights of arson and rioting in theSt. Louis suburbs.

Earlier on Sunday evening hundreds of protesters began 
marching down a main thoroughfare in Berkeley after massing on
the campus of the University of California.

Officer Jenn Coats of the Berkeley Police Department said
the crowd, estimated at 500 to 600, was peaceful.

On Saturday evening, what had begun as a peaceful march
ended in an extended confrontation between demonstrators and
police, resulting in six arrests, damage to local businesses and
a minor injury to a police officer.

'There were definitely a group of people that were intent on
violence,' Coats said.

In downtown Seattle, about 200 people gathered on Sundayevening, a day after a demonstration drew more than 1,000protesters, with some throwing rocks and attacking police inclashes that resulted in seven arrests. Their numbers haddwindled to about 60 by 10 p.m. with only one arrest.

New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said on Sunday the
department's internal investigation into Garner's death could
last four months. He said he would review the results to decide
if officers involved in Garner's arrest had violated department
policy. The Justice Department is doing its own investigation.

In Chicago, church-affiliated protesters marched through the
city, carrying signs and chanting, 'I can't breathe' and 'Hands
up, don't shoot,' television news footage showed.

Protesters in Miami blocked a portion of Interstate 195 on
Sunday afternoon, clogging traffic to the Art Basel show in
Miami Beach, CBS-TV Miami reported.

The outcry over the recent killings surfaced in NFL stadiums
as well. Detroit Lions running back Reggie Bush was among
several players donning pre-game practice jerseys reading 'I
can't breathe,' Garner's dying words.
