A shocking set of images appearing to show 911 dispatchers asleep at their desks in a Florida call center have been released.

The images, taken by a concerned employee over several days in November, show workers hunched over at their desks with their eyes closed.

The staff man the lines at a critical emergency dispatch center in Miami Beach, which handles about 170,000 incidents a year for the fire and police department.

Shocking: This photo taken in November allegedly shows a supervisor dozing next to the employee she was training

As the photos were circulated on Local10 news station, experts have warned that the behavior could put lives at risk.

'This job can go from zero to 60 in a matter of seconds. You need to be awake and alert. Someone could miss a call for assistance,' a retired dispatcher, who asked not to be named, said.

The employee who took the photos claimed that in one image a supervisor is pictured napping alongside the woman she was training.

He claimed it wasn't unusual to see staff sleeping at their desks and that a manager had been made aware of the situation.

Asking to remain anonymous, the employee added that the department was understaffed and claimed everyone was forced to work overtime.

The claims were backed by a retired dispatcher, who claimed staff did 'forced overtime'.

'They would come up to you and say, "You are staying",' the former dispatcher said.

It was alleged that if an employee refused to work overtime they would be issued with an official reprimand.

It is not clear if the people pictured seemingly asleep were on duty at the time, but Miami Police Chief Ray Martinez said the department had spoken to staff previously about sleeping in unauthorized areas.

The dispatch center is reported to be installing cameras in its offices and hiring an extra seven members of staff.

A Mail Online request for comment from the police department has not yet been returned.
