A top Indian entrepreneur was found hanged just days after she complained to police about being harassed by her in-laws over her love-match marriage.

Akanksha Rathi, 32, told police her mother and father-in-law had tried to stop her claiming her husband Anirudh Rathi’s inheritance - and said she had never been good enough for him.

The glamorous businesswoman, renowned in India's male-dominated steel industry, was found dead at her parent's home in Delhi on October 23, just weeks after her husband, 34, died of a heart attack.

She had claimed the family waged a campaign of mental harassment following Mr Rathi’s death on September 4 to stop her inheriting a share of the family steel empire.

Harassed by in-laws: Akanksha Rathi, 32, was found dead just days after she told police that her in-laws tried to stop her claiming her husband Anirudh Rathi's inheritance

Mrs Rathi had improved a branch of the Rathi family business into a £43million a year company in a few years and had won the Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Award in 2009.

Women's rights: Campaigners said that Mrs Rathi's death reflected a 'sad reality' for many women in India unable to overcome caste prejudice

Police said that Mr Rathi’s parents 
confiscated her property and argued she had no claim to it after she 
travelled to New Delhi to attend a religious ceremony for Mr Rathi.

She was later reported missing and was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her home after taking sleeping pills.

The couple had married in 2004 despite objections from his parents to the 'love match'. The Rathis were members of one of the wealthiest families of the Jat caste in modern India.

Police spokesman Abid Khan told The Daily Telegraph: ‘Mrs Rathi had filed a dowry harassment complaint against her in-laws earlier this month.

‘She had accused them of mentally torturing her and passing casuist remarks.

‘We had sent a team to Delhi to arrest the accused named in the complaint but they have acquired anticipatory bail.

‘We will be following the legal procedure.’

Campaigners for women’s rights say Mrs Rathi’s death reflected the ‘sad reality’ for many women in India whose beauty or career successes could not influence caste prejudice.

Akanksha's mother Anita Singh said: 'Not being able to bear the trauma of his death, my daughter ended her life.

'A month and a half after Anirudh's death, on October 16, we lodged a complaint of harassment against Akanksha's in Indore.'
