My mum, Linda, is a lifelong Marks & Spencer clothes shopper. From slacks to sparkly tops, everything she wears is scooped from the rails of this High Street favourite. But I do sometimes wonder if she does it all with her eyes shut.

Or maybe, at 68, she’s got used to playing it safe in beige, florals and the occasional sequin.

In her defence, shopping in M&S can be a bit of a gamble for anyone — their clothes so often blur the line between frumpy and fashionable. But if Mum would just look beyond the ubiquitous waterfall cardigans and shapeless blouses, there are hidden gems to be found.

I decided to show her where I think she’s going wrong and suggested we browse through the new collection and each choose our favourite items. But could I tempt Mum out of her comfort zone?

Black dress, £49.50

Shoes, £79Charlotte says: This dress is a showstopping bargain. It looks designer and it gives a curvy shape, but it’s not too tight. What more can you ask for? Mum looks fantastic and it knocks years off her.Linda says: I couldn’t believe this was from Marks & Sparks — boy, did it look risque! I would never, ever have picked this up for myself — it’s far too showy. But, I have to confess I love it. It’s incredibly flattering, and the biggest surprise is how comfortable it is. I feel really glamorous in it — and I can still breathe.

Parka coat, £89

Green blouse, £28

Long skirt, £45

Boots, £85Linda says:
 This is so me. The anorak could go over absolutely everything I own. I 
love the stylish fur trim and the fact it’s so cosy and comfortable. I 
chose this because I  like the way it covers my middle.Charlotte says: Can you see why I’ve been trying to persuade mum she’s stuck in a style rut? This outfit is dowdy from top to toe.

Cream coat, £249

Metallic skirt, £149

Cream top, £29.50

Court shoes, £79Charlotte says: OK, I admit the skirt’s a bit much, but the coat is hugely stylish and worth the money. Mum looks years younger. Linda says: When I saw this coat, I thought it was a dressing gown. The next shock was the price — £249 is far more than I’d usually spend on an entire outfit, let alone one item. But I admit that it did look — and feel — great.

Linen top, £22

Chinos, £22.50

Sandals £35Linda says: I’ll live in this blouse. It’s lovely and loose and the colour will go with anything. And the trousers are so comfy. Charlotte says: When Mum goes shopping, she’s magnetically attracted to beige, so I’m not surprised she’s chosen this. I tell her the colour makes her look washed out, but she ignores me.

Burgundy top, £35

Brown trousers, £45

Court shoes, £79

Necklace, £19.50Charlotte says: Mum’s convinced herself she needs to wear loose- fitting trousers, but these tailored cigarette pants look terrific. The top is sophisticated and the colour adds warmth.Linda says: Me in a pair of slinky trousers? I never thought I’d see the day at my age, but I can see that they are rather flattering. Crucially, they’re still comfortable, which for me, is a must.

Jumper, £21

Long navy skirt, £45

Ankle boots, £59Linda says: A skirt like this hides a multitude of sins and I can wear it with shoes or winter boots. The jumper is a neutral colour and the three-quarter length sleeves are flattering. Charlotte says: Sorry mum, but where’s the broomstick? This really is an unflattering combination. The skirt piles pounds on you and the jumper’s just ‘blah’. And as for the boots, there should be a law against anything that ugly.

Cardigan, £139

Silk blouse, £35

Leopard-print skirt, £35

Belt, £19.50

Court shoes, £79Charlotte says: The pencil shape makes Mum look slimmer and the animal print is subtle enough to look stylish without a hint of mutton. Linda says: I’m amazed how different I look. Charlotte’s right. The skirt I chose is shapeless in comparison to this one, and the animal print is trendy. But I’m afraid there’s simply no way I’d wear these shoes.

Floral print dress, £39.50

Shoes, £35Linda says: As a rule, I avoid dresses, but I like this one. The floral pattern’s pretty and it’s not too clingy round the middle. It’s shorter than I prefer,  but the sleeves are a flattering length to hide crepey arms. I’d happily wear this to church or out to lunch.Charlotte says: It’s probably best Mum doesn’t buy too many dresses if this is what she goes for. It ages you Mum. Put it back!

Polka dot dress, £49.50

Belt, £8

Shoes, £35Charlotte says: No sleeves, knee-length and fitted at the waist — I’m really pushing Mum out of her comfort zone with this, but I think she looks fantastic. The pattern’s understated and the colour is flattering. It looks fun. You’re not past it, Mum! Linda says: I feel self- conscious about my chubby knees and there’s far too much arm on show for my liking. Quick! Someone get me a cardie.

Linda says: This has definitely spurred me on to be more adventurous. I didn’t realise how much of a rut I was in. Practically all my togs are from Marks & Sparks — but they’re all the same. It’s time to ditch the beige. I thought the more fitted styles would be uncomfortable, but they weren’t and they were more flattering. Charlotte says: I really hope this is the wake-up call Mum needs. She looks terrific. Instead of always buying the same old florals, she needs to experiment. I bet her friends won’t guess it’s all from M&S.
