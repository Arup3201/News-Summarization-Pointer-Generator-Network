Ministers have vowed to continue immigration checks at Tube and train stations - despite allegations of 'racial profiling'.

Immigration minister Mark Harper said one in three of the illegal immigrants caught during operations this summer had already been deported.

He defended the operations, which took place this summer, as part of efforts to encourage migrants with no right to be in Britain to return home.

Speaking to the World At One on BBC Radio 4 he said: 'Yes, there will be more of them.

'We base these operations on intelligence, so where we have cause to think we are going to be successful in targeting people who have no right to be in the United Kingdom, not based on racial profiling, they're based on intelligence and on the behaviour of individuals.

'We will continue to use them because they're effective in targeting people who have no right to be in the United Kingdom and who we should be removing.'

On July 30 immigration officials carried out 29 stops at Kensal Green Tube station in North London, and arrested three people.

At Walthamstow, East London, a total of 48 people were stopped, leading to 14 arrests. One further person was arrested by British Transport Police in Stratford.

Out of the 18 arrests, six have been deported, ten are going through the deportation process and two have claimed asylum.

Mr Harper said the operations had been 'very successful.'

He said such operations were carried out under the last government since 2008.

He added: 'All our operations are intelligence-led, so clearly I want them to be as effective as possible.'

“Would I like to arrest more people as a proportion of those we encounter? Yes I would.'

At the time of the operations, Migrants rights groups accused the Home Office of turning Britain in to a 'hostile environment' for illegal workers, and demanded an amnesty allowing them all to stay.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage also criticised the raids, telling Sky News: 'Spot checks and being demanded to show your papers by officialdom are not the British way of doing things.'

The equality watchdog launched a probe into whether immigration officials were guilty of 'unlawful discrimination'.
