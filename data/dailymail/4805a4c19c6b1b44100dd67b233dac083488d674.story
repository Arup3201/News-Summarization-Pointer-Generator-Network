Town and country: Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the National Trust, says the children of families in rural areas don't have a God-given right to live near their parents

Children raised in the countryside have no automatic right to live near their parents’ homes when they grow up, the chairman of the National Trust declared yesterday.

Sir Simon Jenkins said the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities, rather than in unspoilt rural areas.

His comments are at odds with existing policies that encourage affordable housing to be built in villages for local families.

Sir Simon said: ‘Somehow it is considered the right of people in the country to have their children living next door at public expense. I don’t understand it.

‘Are you going to say that people who have lived in the Windrush Valley [in the Cotswolds] for 100 years have a right to go on living there? No, I’m afraid they don’t. Sorry.’

Last night, some countryside groups attacked his comments, warning that villages without young families risked being turned into ‘little more than retirement ghettoes’.

But Sir Simon, who owns homes in west London and rural Wales, even called for areas of the countryside to be listed to protect the most beautiful parts. He suggested introducing four different listed ‘grades’ of countryside – one of which could include a ‘presumption against development’.

He said: ‘We should list the countryside as we list the town by virtue of its beauty.What it is that people want to retain.

‘We don’t want to pull down Belgravia. We don’t want to build housing estates in Hyde Park. We should adopt the same approach to the countryside.’

Picturesque: Sheepscome in the Cotswolds. Families who have lived in villages like this do not have a right to go on living there, says Sir Simon. He says the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities

Idyll: The village of Snowshill in the Cotswolds. Many countryside groups say there is an urgent need for affordable homes in rural areas

But opponents warned that house prices will rise even higher in rural areas if new homes are not built there.

The row comes at a time when the average home in the countryside costs around £200,000 – around £30,000 more than a town house.

Under threat? Castle Combe in Wiltshire. A minister said Britain faces a situation where home ownership is the right of a privileged few unless more homes are built

The
Windrush is a river in the Cotswolds, which flows through the famously 
picturesque village of Bourton-on-the-Water as well as the Prime 
Minister’s constituency town of Witney.

Prices of homes near the Windrush can be eye-watering, with bungalows in Bourton-on-the-Water selling for up to £645,000 in recent months.

But Sir Simon, who was speaking in a 
personal capacity, told the Home Builders’ Federation conference in 
central London: ‘I want building to take place in towns on the whole. I 
want there to be massive incentives to build in towns because it makes 
more sense.’

He said there 
will be many parts of the countryside – ‘on the whole, rather lovely 
parts of the countryside’ – that ‘just don’t want to take large numbers 
of more people.’

He singled
out the Cotswolds village of Stow-on-the-Wold, where he said many 
residents are ‘seriously angry’ at proposals to build a large number of 
new homes.

Last night his comments were attacked by those who said more affordable rural homes were needed.

Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders’ Federation, said: ‘We need to be providing homes across the country in places where people want to live. We should not be trying to just pigeon-hole people into living in towns where they might not want to live.’

Kate Houghton, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We do agree that the bulk of new housing should be built in or near to urban areas, so people have more easy access to public transport, community facilities and essential services.

Sir Simon said protecting villages like Bisley from major housing developments and concentrating new homes in towns and cities 'makes sense'

‘However, if we don’t make provision 
for at least some affordable houses in rural areas, where it is clear 
that there is need and people do want to stay, then our villages could 
become little more than retirement ghettoes or commuter dormitories.’

At the conference, Malcolm Harris, chairman of house builders Bovis, accused Sir Simon of being ‘quite naïve’.

He
said: ‘These are your children. These are people who already live in 
the community. We have failed for year after year after year to provide 
the housing. That is a real issue in Great Britain.’

In England, around 110,000 new homes are
built ever year, but this is way behind the rate at which new 
households are being formed, estimated to be around 230,000 a year.

A spokesman for Priced Out, the first-time buyers’ campaign group, accused Sir Simon of being ‘out of touch with the aspirations of hard-working young adults who have been priced out of a home in their local area.’

Housing Minister Mark Prisk, who spoke at the same conference, said home ownership remains the dream of the vast majority of Britons.

He told builders that the quality of the homes they build is just as important as the quantity, calling on them to reject the stereotype of the ‘rabbit hutch’.

Sir Simon’s intervention comes weeks after Planning Minister Nick Boles warned Britain will be dragged back to the 19th century when home-ownership was the preserve of the wealthiest unless more homes are built.

He said: ‘We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends.

We can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents.

‘Or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally.’
