Facebook has revealed its income in Ireland is 43 times higher than in the UK, despite being a fraction of the size.

Accounts for the social networking site show how it earned £1.5billion last year through its offices in Ireland, compared to just £35million through Facebook UK Ltd.

Ireland's corporation tax rate is significantly lower than in Britain and MPs have raised concerns about companies using legal methods to register profits in countries with lower tax rates.

Latest figures reveal the huge amount of revenue Facebook says it raised in Ireland, compared to the UK which has a much higher population

The firm says it complies with the law and its Irish office acts as its European HQ.

But it raises further questions about how the firm makes 43 times more money Ireland, despite the UK having 14 times more people.

Facebook makes money from selling adverts targeted at its users based on their personal preferences.

In a practice that is legal but has been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs, the social networking company records most of its UK sales in Ireland. Like other US technology firms such as Google, it bills its UK arm simply as a service and marketing division.

MPs have urged HM Revenue and Customs to take legal action against global firms like Facebook, Amazon and Google to test their claims that they are paying their fair share in Britain.

The Irish tax regime saw the Dublin branch pay only £4.3million in tax, of which £1.6million was corporation tax.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, claimed the government was not doing enough to stop firms from exporting profits

It comes after it emerged Facebook paid no corporation tax in Britain last year despite raking in more than £200million from its UK operations, documents reveal.

It means the internet giant has paid just £1million in corporation tax on the half a billion pounds of revenue it has made since arriving in Britain in 2007.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the public accounts committee said: ‘These artificial tax structures are all too familiar. They are simply devised to avoid paying a fair share of tax on the profits made in the UK.’

She also criticised the government: ‘They are making it easier for companies to export their profits. Far from clamping down on it they are making it easier.’

A Facebook spokesperson said: ‘Facebook complies with all relevant corporate regulations including those related to filing company reports and taxation.

'We have our international headquarters in Ireland that employs almost five hundred people and a series of smaller local offices providing support services all over Europe.

'Dublin was selected as the best location to hire staff with the right skills to run a multi-lingual hi-tech operation serving the whole of Europe.'
