Pieces of art by one of Britain's most notorious criminals are set to be sold for thousands at auction tomorrow.

Charles Bronson cemented his reputation as 'the most violent prisoner in Britain' thanks to a long rap sheet of brutal attacks on prison officers and fellow inmates.

But despite his fearsome reputation, the 61-year-old fitness fanatic, currently serving a life sentence at HM Full Sutton, Yorkshire also has an artistic side - producing large quantities of paintings, drawings and poetry.

And even his name reflects his passion for the arts.

Born Michael Peterson, in August 2014 Bronson changed his name via deed poll to Charles Salvador - a tribute to his favourite artist, the late surrealist painter Salvador Dali.

Now a selection of 200 of the prisoner's artworks are set to go under the hammer at JP Humbert Auctioneers in Towcester, Northamptonshire. 

The collection, offered up by Mr Salvador's family, is believed to be the first ever single-artist sale of Bronson's works.

The lots will include the final ever piece of artwork painted under the name Charles Bronson and the first two pictures drawn under the artist's new name Charles Salvador.

Other items for sale include paintings, personal effects, clothing, signed books, a hand-made Christmas present and even part of his shaved beard.

Mr Salvador now says he has put his violent past behind him and is looking for a peaceful life creating his artworks.

He said: 'I have given this a lot of thought and I really have little choice but to kill Bronson off once and for all. I have become a hostage of my own notoriety - Bronson is burying any chance of me ever being freed.'

Due to the controversial nature of the material, the auction is operating on a 'no estimate, no reserve' basis, but previous paintings by the artist have fetched more than £1,000

Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert said: 'From an individual who has clearly spent most of his adult life in prison and who, by any stretch of the imagination, has lived a very 'alternative' life, come pencil and crayon studies that show an intelligent albeit troubled and frustrated mind working together with a capable and detailed hand, combining to depict works of clear artistic merit.

'What is clear from the many stories that these items tell - is that even though so many years have been served behind bars, the indomitable human condition still fights through with a clear sense of humour that prison walls cannot quell.'

The sale takes place at J P Humbert Auctioneers Ltd of Towcester from 5pm Thursday October 9, with a proportion of money raised going to The Brain Tumour Charity and Keech Cottage Hospice at Luton.
