A busty barmaid dressed in a German lederhosen costume impresses punters with her unique cocktail making skills.

The blonde gets ready to make a Jager bomb, which is a mix of Red Bull and Jagermeister, by lining up ten shots on top of glasses along the bar.

She then balances another ten glasses along her arm and pours the black spirit in each glass with the composure of a true expert.

But the real party trick comes when she turns the tower of glasses on its side and manages to fill each shot glass - without spilling a drop.

Then she nudges the first shot glass and like a pack of dominoes, they fall into each glass of Red Bull, completing the cocktail mix.

The punters are clearly impressed and cheer the skilled bartender on as they film the footage.
