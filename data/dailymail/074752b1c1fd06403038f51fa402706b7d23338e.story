David Cameron was accused of making excuses by Nick Clegg last night as he plunged plans for TV debates between party leaders into further chaos.

The Prime Minister indicated he would take part in a head-to-head with Ed Miliband and a five-way clash adding Mr Clegg, Nigel Farage and Green leader Natalie Bennett.

But he appeared to reject broadcasters’ demands for a third debate featuring only him, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg, dismissing the Lib Dems as a ‘minor party’.

During Prime Minister’s Questions, the Labour leader claimed Mr Cameron was ‘frit’ – a dialect word for ‘frightened’ once used by Margaret Thatcher.

Mr Clegg, sitting next to the Prime Minister, was seen to shout, ‘Excuses, excuses’ at him, while Labour MPs made a chorus of chicken clucking noises.

But Mr Cameron accused Labour and the Lib Dems of ‘running scared’ over the inclusion of the Greens, who are biting into the vote of both parties.

Tory strategists said including the Greens – whose membership has doubled since September and is on course to overtake Ukip’s in weeks – was a ‘simple matter of fairness’, given the party regularly outpolls the Lib Dems and beat them in last May’s European elections.

Broadcasting sources said that if the Greens were included, it would be difficult to refuse the Scottish Nationalists a place. With the SNP on course to win far more seats than Ukip or the Greens, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has threatened legal action unless her party is allowed to participate.

It is far from clear whether Labour would take part in a TV debate in which it could be undermined by the Greens in England and the SNP in Scotland.

Senior broadcasting figures are understood to have discussed whether to ‘empty-chair’ Mr Cameron if he refuses to take part, as Labour is demanding. Roger Mosey, the BBC’s former editorial director, suggested it would be possible to leave a spare lectern where the Prime Minister would have stood.

‘Those who are willing to put themselves on the line should be allowed to do so,’ he wrote in the Guardian. ‘Those who don’t can watch at home and see what an empty chair looks like over 90 minutes of prime-time television.’

Ofcom says ‘due weight’ must be given to the major parties in election campaign coverage.

But some senior broadcasters are concerned about the sway the regulator has over election coverage, after it declared earlier this month that it regards Ukip as a ‘major party’. Senior politicians suggest the terms of the TV debates should be negotiated by an independent commission, as with US presidential clashes.

Miss Bennett last night wrote to Mr Miliband, Mr Farage and Mr Clegg. She revealed that ITV has not yet decided who should take part and urged the three leaders to agree that she should be included. Labour strategists have long been counting on the TV debates to boost their chances – and Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron was using the Greens as a ‘pathetic excuse’ not to take part.

He said it was for broadcasters and ‘not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate’, adding: ‘However he dresses it up, everyone knows he is running scared.’ But Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘I’m all for these debates, but you cannot have two minor parties without the third minor party. Why is [Ed Miliband] frightened of debating the Green Party?’

A Downing Street source said the Tories had made no final decisions about TV debates and various formats were still ‘up in the air’.
