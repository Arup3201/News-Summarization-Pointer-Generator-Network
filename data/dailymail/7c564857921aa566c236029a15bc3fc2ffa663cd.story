Criminal kingpins who robbed British victims of millions of pounds in savings to spend on their playboy lifestyles have been targeted in an unprecedented international crackdown.

A total of 110 alleged fraudsters were held as 
police moved to stamp out so-called boiler room fraud, where investors 
are duped into buying worthless or non-existent shares.

So far 850 UK victims of the gangs 
have been identified, mainly pensioners, who have lost a total of around
 £15 million - ranging from around £2,000 up to £500,000 per person.

One of the victims took their own life after being defrauded.

Smashed: Officers from City of London Police and their Spanish counterparts arrest a suspect after raiding a business property in Barcelona in an international crackdown on a so-called boiler room fraud

Worldwide crackdown: Officers from City of London Police joined Spanish counterparts from the Policia Nacional in a series of dramatic raids in Barcelona, Madrid, Marbella and London

But police believe that this is 'the tip of the iceberg' and that there are thousands of people who have been duped.

Officers from City of London Police joined Spanish counterparts from the Policia Nacional in a series of dramatic raids in Barcelona, Madrid, Marbella and London this week, in one of the biggest anti-fraud operations ever staged.

Details of the crackdown, which also saw arrests in the US and Serbia, can now be reported after a reporting ban was lifted by a Spanish judge.

Investigators targeted a number of organised crime gangs, aiming to take out the top levels of the networks as well as dozens of the conmen who work for them.

Ill-gotten gains: This Aston Martin DB( convertible was among a number of luxury cars towed away in the raids

Seized: Their lifestyles have been likened to the excesses portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street, spending the stolen money on cars like this Ford Mustang Mach 1

Lavish: This Ferrari Spyder and £500,000 in cash were also removed as police targeted the top levels of the criminal networks as well as dozens of the conmen who work for them

Sprawling criminal network: Police believe that these raids are 'the tip of the iceberg' and that there are thousands of people who have been duped

Excess: The fraudsters also spent the stolen cash on designer watches (above), drugs and prostitutes

Their lifestyles have been likened to the excesses portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street, spending the stolen money on sports cars, designer watches, drugs and prostitutes.

One of the suspects was believed to be paying £40,000 per month just to rent an apartment.

An Aston Martin, Mustang, Ferrari and BMW were among the cars seized by police, along with various watches and £500,000 in cash.

Speaking near the site of one of the searches in Barcelona on Tuesday, City of London Police Commander Steve Head, said: 'What we've seen today is the culmination of a two-year investigation that has been worldwide in its nature. What we've seen is an unprecedented level of co-operation.

'We expect this network alone to have upwards of 1,000 victims. We've seen millions of pounds taken from people.

International ring: Of the 110 arrests, there were 84 in Spain, 20 in the UK, two in the U.S. and four in Serbia

Facing trial: Most of the suspects are British and a core group are expected to be extradited back to the UK

Boiler room fraud is a scam where conmen sell worthless or non-existent shares to unsuspecting customers.

They are called 'boiler room' scams because of the high-pressure techniques employed by the broker.

They buy a list of investors who have already put money into companies, perhaps from a corrupt stock broker or from a data store that sells personal information, and then contact them, offering tempting investment returns.

Most of their victims will be elderly and lonely people who live in rural areas and are more isolated and easier to trick.

The gangs targeted in the unprecedented operation led by City of London and Spanish police would use high pressure sales techniques, assuming false identities and bullying them into handing over money.

Sometimes they would use confidence tricks, paying out a small 'dividend' to persuade the investor to give them more of their cash.

This kind of scam is considered to be one of the greatest fraud threats to the UK, with an estimated £240 million lost by victims last year.

'You see real victims in real communities whose lives have been devastated. Savings that they thought they could rely on in their old age have gone in a heartbeat.'

In total, the international team executed 35 warrants on offices used to run the fraud and the criminals' lavish homes.

Mr Head added: 'These people have no conscience in terms of what they do to people's lives. This is not at all a victimless crime. We've seen lives that have been utterly devastated.

'We have dismantled an international network of fraudsters. Make no mistake, this will make a difference to the ability of fraudsters to operate at this level.

'This network has been dismantled, hopefully we have sent a message to those who think that it's an easy crime that it doesn't matter where you are, we will come after you.'

As well as the investment scams the gangs are involved in drug dealing, money laundering and gun crime, and use their ill-gotten profits to hire prostitutes.

City of London Police has spent two 
years looking at the top levels of the fraud gangs, and aimed to take 
out key figures such as lawyers, money launderers and financiers.

Around
 40 officers from the force travelled to Spain for the operation, staged
 along with around 300 of their Spanish counterparts.

Evidence: Officers from City of London Police and their Spanish counterparts from the Policia Nacional remove items after raiding a business property in Barcelona

Taken out: The operation closed down 14 boiler rooms in Spain, two in the UK and one in Serbia

Extensive operation: City of London Police has spent two years looking at the top levels of the fraud gangs and aimed to take out key figures such as lawyers, money launderers and financiers

Joint enterprise: Around 40 officers from the force travelled to Spain for the operation, staged along with around 300 of their Spanish counterparts

Most of the suspects they were targeting are British, and a core group are expected to be extradited back to the UK to face trial.

Commissioner Jose Luis Andre Vega from the Spanish national police, said: 'This sort of crime knows no frontiers or boundaries. It's important to investigate this sort of organised crime on an international level.'

It is one of the biggest ever police 
operations to crack down on fraud, and also involved the UK National 
Crime Agency, Financial Conduct Authority and Serious Fraud Office.

Mr Head added: 'In terms of economic crime and fraud this is one of the biggest operations there has ever been.

'The kind of co-operation we've seen has never been seen before in terms of going after international fraudsters.

'That's a really important message to go out there to those international fraudsters who think they can act with impunity.

'We have shown that we can work together with law enforcement teams across the world to go after these people.'

Of the 110 arrests, there were 84 in Spain, 20 in the UK, two in the United States and four in Serbia, with most of the suspects arrested on suspicion of money laundering and fraud offences.

The operation closed down 14 boiler rooms in Spain, two in the UK and one in Serbia.
