A 12-year-old boy and his  instructor died after their hang glider crashed onto a dry lake bed in Nevada.

The child, whose name has not been released, was visiting with his family from New Mexico and was inside the hang glider tethered to a pick-up truck that plummeted to the ground on Friday afternoon. 

The adult male instructor, who has not been identified, died at the scene, while the boy's family  was able to transport him to Nevada Highway Patrol troopers who were on the side of the road. 

However, as troopers performed CPR they were unable to revive him.

A boy, 12, and his hang-gliding instructor died after their glider crashed onto a dry lake bed in Nevada 

During the activity, the hang gliding company, which has not been named, tethers gliders to the rear of a pickup truck to propel them into the air

Stanley Oloff, who was at the scene and is reportedly the child's great grandfather said that the family loved adventure and that it was their first time trying hang gliding

Metro police and NHP troopers arrived at the first scene of the incident, where the glider crashed at the Jean dry lake bed, near Sloan Road and Interstate 15 at 2.50pm, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal.  

The family. from Farmington, was a part of a tour group that was organized to do the activity with the hang gliding company, which has not been named, according to Fox 5 Vegas.

Stanley Oloff, who was at the scene and is reportedly the child's great grand-father, said the family loved adventure and that it was their first time trying hang gliding.

The boy was the most excited of the group so he was selected to go on the first ride. 

During the activity, the hang gliding company tethers gliders to the rear of a truck to propel them into the air. 

Police said the hang glider was in the air when the truck driver pulling them turned around abruptly.

The driver is believed to have thought the tether had been released which is ordinarily done by the person inside of the glider, before both the child and the man tragically plummeted to the ground.

Authorities are still trying to piece together the cause of the incident and said it was too early to determine if it was a result of a mechanical or operational issue, said Capt. Peter Boffelli

Police said the glider was supposed to release the tether from the truck itself. Apparently, that tether release did not occur

Troopers performed CPR, but the child died while inside of the truck, said Trooper Loy Hixson

Metro police and the Federal Aviation Administration are still investigating the incident

'The glider was supposed to release the tether from the truck itself. Apparently, that tether release did not occur,' said Capt. Peter Boffelli from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

'So what occurred is when the truck turned around thinking the tether was released, the glider itself plummeted straight to the ground.' 

The male instructor died while inside the glider. 

The boy's family and some of the company's employees placed the child inside of a truck and were headed to a hospital in Las Vegas when they spotted NHP troopers 10 miles away on the side of the road, according to 8 News Now.

The troopers performed CPR, but the child died while inside of the truck, said Trooper Loy Hixson. 

Authorities are still trying to piece together the cause of the incident and said it was too early to determine if it was a result of a mechanical or operational issue, said Boffelli.

Metro police and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating.
