Every single major artery on Britain's railways will remain closed on Boxing Day, leaving millions stranded or pushing them onto the roads.

No trains will run between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western mainlines - and the Midland, Cross Country and East Anglia lines will also remain shut.

The near-non-existent service has returned this year despite a fierce political battle over the so-called Boxing Day shutdown dating back to at least 2007.

Leaving the city? Perish the thought - every cross-country artery will be closed again on Boxing Day

Labour and Tories have repeatedly traded accusations over the lack of service, which affects football fans, families without cars and shop workers in the Boxing Day sales.

Apart from airport shuttles and Eurostar, only Chiltern, Scotrail, Southeastern and Southern will be running any trains on December 26.

Even then the services will be extremely limited and only call at major stations.

Not even the Heathrow Express train from London to its largest airport will be running, despite terminals remaining open on Boxing Day.

Campaigners blamed a 'blind spot' in the set-up of private rail franchises which puts no obligation on firms to run services on December 26. 

Bruce Williamson, spokesman for the passenger group Railfuture, told MailOnline: 'Things need to improve.

'Even trains not running on Christmas Day is a relatively new development - I believe British Rail were running Christmas Day trains as recently as 1981.

'We appreciate it sometimes makes more sense to extend Christmas engineering works to Boxing Day to give yourself a major chunk of time, but we're calling for more lines to be open next year.

'The problem is it's a blind spot in the way the Department for Transport runs its franchise agreement with the operating companies.

'They're under no obligation to run on Boxing Day and it's often a loss leader because you don't have huge numbers of people travelling.'

He added: 'Personally I'm already down at my mother's house in Devon. I drove because I didn't want to be stranded, and because I'm sure the trains will be absolutely rammed to the gills today.'

Despite the complaints Boxing Day is traditionally quiet compared to normal commuting days - so many firms are using the opportunity to do engineering work.

London Bridge station, one of the largest in the capital, will see one of the most disruptive parts of its five-year upgrade this week as part of the £6billion Thameslink programme.

A Department for Transport spokesman told MailOnline: 'Deciding the level of service on specific days is a matter for train operators. 

'But we know passengers want to travel on Boxing Day, and that’s why we have worked with the rail industry to ensure there are limited services on some franchises on that day.

'Network Rail and train companies have ensured that a large part of the railway will remain open over the Christmas/New Year period and alternative routes are provided where the lines are closed for essential engineering work, and that these are communicated properly to the public.'

One group that will be worst-hit are football supporters - with ten major Premier League fixtures on Boxing Day involving some of the nation's biggest clubs.

Tottenham Hotspur fans  face a 100-mile trek to a 3pm kick-off against Leicester City while Aston Villa fans will have to travel 150 miles for their club's draw against Swansea City.

Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke told the Daily Mirror: 'This is a ­significant issue for a lot of fans. Not just away fans - without public transport even home fans can find a three or four mile journey almost impossible.

'This is one of the biggest footballing days of the calendar. It is a shame nothing has changed.' 

Similar chaos in previous years prompted transport minister Stephen Hammond to tell the Commons in January there was 'no reason' why lines without engineering works shouldn't run.

While in opposition Mr Hammond slammed the Labour government over Boxing Day line closures, saying they were 'condemning sports fans and families trying to celebrate the Christmas period together to misery on our clogged-up motorways.' 

But he was sacked in July's reshuffle and today Labour accused the Tories of hypocrisy.

Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher told the Mirror: 'They had four and a half years to do something about this, but the lack of action shows they never really cared'. 

Politics: The Boxing Day shutdown has been the subject of party political spats since at least 2007

A spokesman for the campaign group Passenger Focus said operators often had no choice but to close lines on Boxing Day.

'This is nothing new,' he told MailOnline. 'If the operators did decide to run services on Boxing Day that's usually the period when Network Rail wants to shut the network down anyway for engineering work.

'The people who are put at a disadvantage are the leisure traveller, such as football fans, who want to travel and come across a lot of engineering work. If you are a commuter Monday to Friday you're less likely to encounter that.

'But we have been calling for investment and improvement and the quiet Christmas period is the ideal time to do that. You have to go with the numbers, and Christmas is a traditionally quiet time'.
