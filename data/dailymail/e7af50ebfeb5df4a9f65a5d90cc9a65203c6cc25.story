Disgraced charity boss Greg Mortenson has returned to Afghanistan in a desperate bid to repair his shattered reputation after being found to have misused funds and lied repeatedly in his best-selling book.

The 'Three Cups of Tea' author was pictured visiting female students at a middle school established by his Central Asia Institute charity, in Afghanistan’s Logar province.

Three years ago, Mortenson's world came crashing down after '60 Minutes' and author Jon Krakauer alleged he had fabricated much of the book and mismanaged the charity which he co-founded.

Three Cups of Tea author Greg Mortenson has returned to Afghanistan after his reputation was left in tatters when he was found to have lied repeatedly in his best-selling book

Mortenson was subsequently found to have spent millions in donations on his personal expenses, including travel and clothing. 

Three Cups of Tea details how Mortenson resolved to build schools in Central Asia after he became lost and wandered into a poor Pakistani village, then follows him as he expands his school-building efforts there. 

Among many indiscrepancies was Mr Mortenson's account that he wandered lost into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb the world's second-highest peak, K2, then decided to build a school there.

His previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village.

60 Minutes revealed that Mortenson made up large parts of his best-seller Three Cups of Tea, and its sequel Stones Into Schools

In an interview published in the Washington Post he now admits he was only in Korphe for a few hours saying his relationships with villagers developed on subsequent visits.

He said: 'It was obviously a lie.

'I stand by the story, but there were compressions and omissions.'  

He now admits that said that he didn’t pay close attention to the writing of the book,and that it was largely penned by his co-author, David Oliver Relin.

Mr Relin tragically committed suicide after the inaccuracies in the book were exposed.

The book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson founded in 1996 with a $1million donation from Dr. Jean Hoerni, a Swiss physicist and mountaineer. 

An attorney general's investigation resulted in Mortenson reimbursing the organization more than $1.1million, removing him from any financial decisions and making wholesale changes to the organization's leadership. 

He added: 'I suck as an administrator.

'The book was the best thing we had. By promoting the book, I was bringing in money to CAI.'

Mortenson was also accused of not building some of the Afghanistan schools he claimed to have built. Others were revealed not to have had any students. 

He has previously said he plans to eventually leave the organization, but first wants to help raise contributions so they match expenses.

He still understood to be the highest-paid employee of Central Asia Institute, drawing $169,000 in salaries and benefits last year.  

The scandal caused the charity to lose most of its donors, with contributions plummeting from a high of about $22million in 2010 to $2.7million last year.

After its release in 2006, Three Cups of Tea became a best seller and it, along with Mortenson's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years, resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the Central Asia Institute - the charity he ran. 

In one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held Mother Teresa's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000.

Mother Teresa passed away in 1997 - the same week that Princess Diana lost her life in car crash in Paris.

He was said to have reaped financial benefits at the expense of the CAI, including the free promotion of Three Cups of Tea and his later book, Stones Into Schools.

He also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies CAI bought to donate to libraries, schools, churches and military personnel, a 2012 report by the Montana Attorney General said.

Mortenson has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering, fraud, deceit, breach of contract and unjust enrichment.

However, in the aftermath of the 60 Minutes investigation Mortenson was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights, family vacations and luxury personal items.

Mortenson's control of the Central Asia Institute went largely unchallenged by its board of directors, which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him, the report prepared by the Montana Attorney General's office said.

When an employee would question his practices, Mortenson either resisted or ignored the person.

The result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for. Itemized expenses listed as program-related were missing supporting receipts and documentation.

Employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to CAI credit cards.

In 2012, Mortenson was told he must reimburse the charity more than $1million under a settlement agreement - according to Montana's Attorney General.

The attorney general's probe focused only on the charity's finances and operations, and did not examine the books' contents.

The yearlong investigation from 2011 to 2012 concluded that the Central Asia Institute took in far more donations than it spent, and had $23million in reserves.

Greg Mortenson's best-selling book 'Three Cups of Tea' came under intense scrutiny after 60 Minutes, author Jon Krakauer and some people in the book said some of the stories were fabricated. Here is a glance at some of those stories, what is being disputed and Mortenson's response in a recent interview with The Associated Press.

MORTENSON'S DESCENT FROM K2:

Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson stumbled upon the Pakistani village of Korphe in fall 1993 after trekking from the base camp of K2, the world's second-highest peak. He spent days in the village recovering from the descent.

The dispute: Mortenson could not have wandered to Korphe on that trip because it is on the opposite side of the Braldu River, which could not be crossed without reaching Mortenson's original destination on the opposite shore, the village of Askole. Author Jon Krakauer says no bridge crossing existed. Krakauer says he interviewed a climber and others who confirmed a bridge was at that location before and after that period, but not at the time Mortenson was there.

Mortenson's response: Mortenson insists he went to Korphe over a narrow footbridge, and disputes Krakauer's assertions to the contrary. Mortenson has acknowledged that he spent only a few hours there, not days as was depicted in the book.

MORTENSON'S PROMISE TO BUILD A SCHOOL:

Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson promised the villagers of Korphe that he would build them a school, after they nursed him back to health. That promise forever changed his life, and he dedicated himself to building schools in Central Asia.

The dispute: Since Mortenson never went to Korphe, he couldn't have promised to build them a school. However, he did promise the villagers of Khane to the southeast that he would build them a school, but he reneged on that promise and instead built it in Korphe. A fundraising plea written by Mortenson in 1994 backs up the claim that he wanted to build the school in Khane, and it makes no mention of Korphe.

Mortenson's response: Mortenson now says he visited both Korphe and Khane villages during that 1993 trip, and promised the residents of both that he would build schools for them. He says he planned to first build the Khane school but then switched to Korphe after finding a lack of local support and corruption in the first.

MORTENSON'S KIDNAPPING:

Three Cups of Tea: Mortenson was kidnapped and held hostage by militants in the remote Pakistani region of Waziristan. They took his passport and money, kept him under armed guard and monitored his every movement. He won his freedom after asking for a Koran and telling his captors that his wife was expecting a child.

The dispute: People who were there described Mortenson as a guest in Waziristan, not a hostage. A photo shows him with his supposed captors, with Mortenson brandishing an AK-47.

Mortenson's response: Mortenson stands by his story, though he says he regrets the unflattering descriptions of his captors in 'Three Cups of Tea.'
