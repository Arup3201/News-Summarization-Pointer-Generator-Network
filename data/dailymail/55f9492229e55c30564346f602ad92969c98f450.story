A brave bride who lost both her legs and one arm to an infection has made a miraculous recovery to walk down the aisle and marry her long term love.

Debbie Bury, 44, was struck down with a rare form of pneumonia last year and was forced to call off the wedding to partner Bob Bury, 63.

Debbie, from Gilberdyke, East Yorks, managed to pull through, despite falling into a coma - but doctors were forced to amputate both her legs, and part of her right hand.

Debbie decided to postpone the nuptials, and, determined to walk down the aisle, began learning to walk again on prosthetic legs.

Twelve months on, inspirational Debbie finally said 'I do' in front of hundreds of her friends and family after proving doctors wrong and fighting to tie the knot.

Debbie said: 'It's been a marvellous day, very tiring, but worth it.

'I was a bit nervous, but because people were all be looking at me, not because I thought I'd fall.

'There were times when I thought I wouldn't be able to walk down the aisle, but I had a test run and that went okay.

'I'm so excited to be marrying Bob - I've waited long enough for it.'

Debbie clutched her partner's hand after exchanging rings and family and friends applauded as she was led out of the church.

Bob was dressed in his Merchant Navy uniform, while his bride wore a white dress with a long train, which she was able to wear despite having had the fitting for the dress before falling ill and losing her legs.

The rare form of the lung condition meant Debbie spent 6 weeks in a coma, and doctors were forced to amputate both of her lower legs as well as her fingers and half the palm of her right hand

Bob said: 'Debbie looked beautiful and she's a very happy girl. It was about time we finally got married.'

Reverend Rob Taylor, who led the wedding ceremony, said he felt proud to marry the couple.

Revered Taylor said: 'Every wedding is a joyous occasion but when there are special circumstances like this, it's all the more memorable. It was a real delight.'

The couple were taken by horse and carriage to the Lowther Hotel, in Goole, for their wedding reception and they are planning a honeymoon later this year.

Family member Gareth Davies, 45, walked Debbie down the aisle and she wore dainty shoes attached to her prosthetic limbs.

Gareth said: 'We're all really proud of her, it's amazing how she's overcome everything.

'This is a day we never thought would come after she fell ill.'

Bridesmaids at the were Gareth's wife Nicola, Debbie's stepdaughter and sister Claire Bury, who wore red gowns.

Nicola, 38, said: 'It was a bit strange to see my dad get married but it's been a very emotional day and it's a real milestone for the pair of them.

'I think Debbie was quite overcome by it all afterwards.'

Best man, Paul Holland, 30, Bob's grandson, said: 'It's been a nice ceremony and it's about time they had some good luck.

'This is the happy ending they both deserve.'

Pneumonia is inflammation of the tissue in one or both of your lungs. It is usually caused by an infection.At the end of the breathing tubes in your lungs are clusters of tiny air sacs. If you have pneumonia, these tiny sacs become inflamed and fill up with fluid.

The most common cause of pneumonia is a pneumococcal infection caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae.

However, there are many different types of bacteria and viruses that can lead to pneumonia.

The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly (over 24-48 hours) or may come on more slowly, over several days.

Pneumonia symptoms vary and can be similar to those of other chest infections, such as acute bronchitis.

You are likely to have a cough. This can be dry, or may produce phlegm (thick mucus) that is yellow, green, brownish or blood-stained.

Most people recover well with antibiotics and rest, but the elderly and those with a weakened immune system may be at increased risk

If you experience any symptoms of pneumonia, see your GP for diagnosis.

Debbie, who insisted she had waited 'long enough' to marry Bob, had a wedding dress fitting the day before she became ill.

She went into a six-week coma last year before undergoing several surgeries.

Debbie said: 'I woke up in the night feeling ill, and I went straight to the doctor the next day.

'They said I had contracted a viral infection and that I had a serious form of pneumonia.

'That is all I remember until I woke up a month later.'

Debbie was rushed from Hull Royal Infirmary, where her initial diagnosis was given, to Glenfield Hospital near Leicester, which has a special unit for dealing with viral infections.

While Debbie was transferred, relatives frantically tried to contact her fiancee, who was working in the merchant navy in Brazil.

He was able to fly back to the UK and arrived in Leicester two days after Debbie was admitted.

Bob said: 'They said it was one of the worst cases they had seen.'

As the cocktail of medicines and Debbie's body fought to keep her vital organs going, her limbs started to die.

Bob said: 'We started talking about funeral arrangements at the hospital, the doctors advised me to start making them.

'I thought I would be travelling back to cancel our wedding and book a funeral.

'But that week, she started improving.'

Debbie had begun to feel tired and was coughing on the evening of Sunday, March 11, last year.

She was taken by ambulance to Hull Royal Infirmary and then Leicester the following day. Bob arrived at Glenfield Hospital on Wednesday, March 14.

Bob said: 'When she was in the coma I would keep talking to her.

'I'd just tell her about everyday things like what was going on and who would be visiting her that day.

'When I spoke to her, her eyes would flutter like she was trying to open them, so the nurses said keep doing it.'

In April, Debbie was transferred back to Hull Royal Infirmary and she started to come round.

She said: 'When I woke up I couldn't even move my head and I had a bed sore, which had worn through to my skull because I had been on the bed such a long time.

'It was very scary when I woke up, I didn't know what was happening.'

At first, doctors thought they would be able to save Debbie's legs near her ankles, but when surgery began they realised they would have to remove most of her calves, almost to her knees.

Her fingers and half of her palm was amputated on her right hand.

She also had to have her little finger on her left hand removed.

Debbie was allowed home on July 13, last year and in August she was fitted with her first pair of new prosthetic legs.

Debbie said: 'As the swelling keeps decreasing, I will need different legs in future.

'I don't know whether I'll be able to have a bionic hand, but I've told them I don't just want a plastic thing that is for show. I'd rather just have nothing if it isn't going to have a function.'
