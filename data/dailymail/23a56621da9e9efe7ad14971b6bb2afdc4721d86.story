It was the most memorable goal of an unforgettable World Cup, and now Robin van Persie's diving header against Spain is adorning the walls of a Brazilian favela in a brilliant bit of street art.

While the YouTube videos and Vines will serve as a reminder of Van Persie's brilliance online, Brazilian artists have left a more traditional tribute to the wondergoal on the streets of a favela.

Daley Blind's 50-yard ball from the left wing had looked to evade the Dutch hitman before he threw himself forward to brilliantly guide it over Iker Casillas and into the back of the Spain net - inspiring his side to eventually run out 5-1 winners in the group stage.
