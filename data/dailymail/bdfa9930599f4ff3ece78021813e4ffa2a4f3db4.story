Almost a third of married women say they still haven’t found Mr Right, while most men claim they're happy with their other halves.

Research revealed that while most women claim to love their husbands, 31 per cent said they were still on the hunt for their ideal partner and were still attracted to other men.

Of their doting husbands however, 69 per cent said they'd definitely found the One and were happily married, according to the poll of 1,000 adults by The Fine Bedding Company.

The poll which surveyed 1,000 married adults turned up some interesting results

The majority of women who admitted they still hadn't found the perfect partner despite being married believed this was because they were still attracted to other men.

Fortunately for their other halves, 83 per cent insisted they would remain faithful if Mr Right came along. 

Married men who claim not to have met their ideal spouse also blame being attracted to other women as the reason why.

1. You're still attracted to your spouse

2. You consider your other half to be your best friend

3. Your partner still makes you laugh

4. You agree on important family decisions

5. You are proud of each other's achievements

However contented couples cited still being attracted to each other as the most important part of a happy relationship, with 33 per cent of women and 39 per cent of men saying they still 'fancied' their other half despite being in a long-term relationship.

Having a husband who is your best friend or who makes you laugh as well as agreeing on important family decisions were also listed by women as the keys to a happy marriage.

The fifth most common reason given by married women as to why they know their partner is the One is that they admire their husband's achievements. 

The same five reasons were given by men, though more (12 per cent) admitted to being proud of their wife's accomplishments.

Only ten per cent of the men and women polled said they didn't believe there was such a thing as Mr or Mrs Right when it comes to true love.

Emma Heald of the Fine Bedding Company said: 'The overwhelming majority of Brits believe that The One is out there somewhere and it is just a matter of finding them.

Happily married individuals such as Richard and Judy (pictured) said being able to make their partner's 
laugh, calling them their best friends and being attracted to one 
another made for a successful marriage

'Many admit that, though they are 
married, they have still not have found their perfect love.

'But, they 
also are quite certain that they do love their partner and that, even if
 Mr or Mrs Right were now to come along, they would remain faithful to 
their spouse.

'We were shocked by just how many people still believe they haven’t found their perfect love.'
