This two-year-old really has something to shout about - he has scaled the most spectacular mountains in the U.S.

Backpacking toddler Bodhi Bennett went on his first outdoor adventure when he was just five days old.

Along with his mother Shannon, 27, who is currently pregnant with her second child, and father Blake, 29, he has taken part in numerous climbs and more than 300 miles of hiking.

The youngster, from Mammoth Lakes in California, has witnessed stunning sights such as Thousand Island Lake in the Sierra Nevada and Yosemite National Park.

In total he has explored around 40 different US states and the majority of America's national parks.

Since Bodhi was born, Mrs Bennett has documented their hikes on Instagram - racking up thousands of followers in the process.

She said: 'When I was pregnant with Bodhi it was important to my husband and I that our lives didn't change because we were going to become parents.

'We had heard so many times that children change your life completely and you can no longer do those fun things you did when you were younger.

'But Bodhi climbs everything and really enjoys mimicking what we do.'

Mrs Bennett, who has years of climbing and backpacking experience, insists she takes extreme caution with Bodhi while following all safety precautions.

She added: 'People are always incredibly pleased to see a child way out in the back country.

'We've heard it so many times - people saying they have never seen such a young hiker before.

'I don't know if I've ever been so proud of anything in my life as I am when I witness his ability and determination.

'I'm due to give birth in two weeks and have never felt stronger in my life - women should know anything is possible with the right mind set.'
