With Christmas approaching, one might have expected the future Edward VIII to be full of good cheer.

But after arriving at Sandringham in 1919 to join his family for the holidays, he told his lover he was ‘so, so sick of his bloody job’, describing the pain he felt that his royal commitments were keeping them apart.

In a recently unearthed letter to his mistress Freda Dudley Ward, the 25-year-old Edward makes it clear – using somewhat colourful language – that he would rather spend time with her than on official duties.

Lovestruck Edward had an affair with mother-of-two Mrs Dudley Ward from 1918 to 1923, years before giving up the throne in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. 

Edward, who was known as David, Prince of Wales at the time, also moaned about a 'f****** world trip' he was about to embark upon in his royal capacity.

Their liaison began in 1918 after a chance meeting at a party in an air raid in London and lasted five years.

Then 23, the socialite was a married to Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, who apparently turned a blind eye to the affair.

By 1919, the prince wrote he was 'fearfully madly' in love, and appears to have introduced her to members of the Royal Family, including his brother Bertie, the future King George VI.

The letter he wrote to her is now tipped to sell for £3,000 when it is sold at auction later this month.

In it, he wrote of how he loathed saying goodbye to Mrs Dudley Ward on the morning he wrote the letter.

He stated: 'I do so resent this separation and I do miss you so this evening my precious one. I feel so lost sweetie. I’ve been thinking of you so much sweetheart since we parted and am so happy I took you to the station.

'Darling, darling I can’t even start to try to thank you and bless you for all your divine marvellous sweetness.

'I can never tell you how madly and desperately I love you darling and you know it and how yuou mean absolutely all and everything to me in life; nothing else seems to matter now, not even my bloody job of which I am so so sick!!'

Their affair was well-known to aristocrats and politicians.

In 1927, Winston Churchill travelled on a train with the couple, and noted: 'It was quite pathetic to see the prince with Freda. His love is so obvious and undisguisable.'

The prince sent her thousands of letters and the pair stayed in contact until he met Mrs Simpson.

He would bombard Mrs Dudley Ward her with extravagant gifts, including a gold watch, and wrote letters to his 'precious Fredie Wedie', signing off as 'adoring little David'.

Mark Huddlestone, from Birmingham’s Fellows auctioneers, said: 'The love letter reveals a rare glimpse of the innermost private lives of the British monarchy, and furthermore of an ordinary man completely besotted with his lover.

'The letter portrays the scene of a man, forced to leave his lover over work commitments.

'Writing only hours after their parting, he passionately describes his hatred for leaving her on the train platform that morning, and his longing for her reply.

'The Prince describes his Royal duties as tedious chores, tearing him away from his love and one person in the world he feels at home with.

'Edward wrote to his mistress frequently throughout their relationship, each letter filled with as much passion and infatuation as the last.'

In the letter, the former monarch also wrote of a hair-raising car journey he took with his brother Bertie, who became King George VI on the way to Sandringham in Christmas 1919.

The two princes drove at over 60mph on ‘greasy’ country roads to reach the rural estate, bursting a tyre along the way.

Edward headed the letter ‘York Cottage, Sandringham’ and, clearly wanting to be elsewhere, wrote underneath the address ‘f*** it!!!’

Writing about the perilous car journey he said: 'Bertie and I arrived safely at 6.00.

'We took 4 hrs to come via Newmarket as the roads were greasy and we tore an outer cover which meant changing the wheel; but the car ran fine and we overran 60mph twice tho how I wanted you to be sitting beside me instead of Bertie.'

The letter is owned by a private collector and is being sold on March 30.
