Some of his team-mates may be back home going through some tough training sessions, but Manchester United star Wayne Rooney looked a million miles way in Las Vegas.

Rooney, with wife Coleen, was relaxing by his hotel pool in the party capital of USA on Monday, while Ryan Giggs took pre-season training at Carrington.

The likes of Tom Cleverley and Jonny Evans were put through their paces ahead of the new campaign, with Louis van Gaal ordering double sessions for some.

Even though the Dutchman is thousands of miles way with Holland at the World Cup, the new manager has put his stamp on the squad as United prepare to bounce back after a turbulent campaign under David Moyes.

Coleen and Wayne spent the day around the hotel pool in the heat in Vegas, surrounded by their friends.
