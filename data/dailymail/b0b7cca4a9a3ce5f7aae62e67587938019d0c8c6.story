She suffered throughout what she described as a difficult and painful pregnancy.

But in the few days before she was rushed to hospital with suspected preeclampsia, there was a sanguine beauty about Kim Kardashian as she relaxed in Los Angeles sunshine.

The 32-year-old looked beautiful as she showed off her expectant form in a pretty Inca bikini while relaxing by a pool with friends.

She gained a substantial amount of weight during her pregnancy and Kardashian is apparently already trying to shift those pounds.

Meanwhile it's been revealed that the baby's name does NOT start with a 'k': 'They're not quite ready to announce the name yet,; a source close to the couple tells Us Weekly.

'But the name definitely does not start with a K, despite all the rumors that have been out.'

The reality star is reported to have just left hospital following the birth of her daughter in the early hours of Saturday morning according to Hollywood Life.

And according to reports she can’t wait to get back in the gym and regain her slim figure.

‘She’s already looking ahead to when she can exercise again,’ a source told Us Weekly.

Another added: ‘She really wants to get back into shape. It’s important to her.’

The eye of the storm: Little did Kim know she would be delivering her daughter in just a few days

Kim, 32, was working with trainer to the stars Tracy Anderson throughout her pregnancy, but the publication also claims she is considering hiring Gunnar Peterson.

Gunnar is responsible for helping Kim’s younger sister Khloe, 28, with her recent 25lbs weight loss.

While she is not able to start exercising just yet, Kim is allegedly already watching what she eats.

The magazine claims that the star’s hospital room is chock-a-block with flowers but she has insisted well-wishers are not allowed to bring any tasty treats for her to eat.

‘She has over 30 bouquets from loved ones,’ a source said. ‘She told everyone not to bring sweets – she said she doesn’t need any temptations.’

It is believed that Kim and her daughter, whose name is yet to be revealed, will stay in hospital until the baby, who was born five weeks prematurely, reaches five pounds.

While Kim and the little one are getting some rest, the baby’s father Kanye West has apparently been hard at work.

The rapper’s creative juices have been flowing since he welcomed his daughter into the world.

‘He's been really inspired by the birth,’ a source told Life & Style. ‘He's written four songs already.’

The insider added that while Kanye, whose album Yeezus was released on Tuesday, has been busy with his music, he has also been very attentive to his two girls.

‘Kanye is actually really being good right now,’ the source said.

Kim is unsurprisingly enamoured with her child and gushed to a friend that the little one ‘is so cute and sweet’, according to Us Weekly.

But she had a stressful time during the birth over the weekend.

Warned by doctors that she was most likely suffering from the life-threatening condition preeclampsia, Kim was forced to deal with going into premature labour on Friday night to save the life of her baby girl.

With her 'blood pressure skyrocketing' and 'the baby in distress' according to reports, the TV favourite was forced to grit her teeth and get on with the delivery.

And the curvy brunette was so brave in dealing with the terrifying ordeal that her often absent beau, 36, is now desperate to marry her as soon as possible.

'They'll start planning their next project, a wedding, sooner rather than later,' a source told People.

'He definitely wants to marry her, he hasn't left her side.'

While their recently purchased $9million Bel Air home is being renovated, Kim and baby will be staying with her mother Kris Jenner and Kanye has also agreed to move in.

A source told HollywoodLife.com that the New Slaves hitmaker thinks the move is 'a good idea'.

The insider added: 'All that's going to happen is that the family is going to wait on Kim hand-and-foot and do everything around the house while she and Kanye just chill with the baby. That sounds like a deal. It's like first class service all the way at Kim's mom's house.'

The source also said: 'They want to take their girl home and love her and begin this journey together.

They're very thankful for the way they've been treated, and the hospitality [at the hospital] is amazing. But it's nothing like being at home, in your own space, with your own things.'
