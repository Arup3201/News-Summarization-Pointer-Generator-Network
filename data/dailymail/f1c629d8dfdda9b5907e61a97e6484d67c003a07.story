TV pundits and political analysts love making lists, ranking those in Capitol Hill on their skills, achievements, and, of course, shortcomings.

But one annual list takes a look at Washington’s workers in a more superficial way.

Enter The Hill’s annual ranking of the most winsome, attractive, and handsome – the Top 50 Most Beautiful People list, which is topped off by a former TGI Friday’s Worker-turned model-turned House Administration Committee staffer and a special assistant to a Republican representative.

Number one: Max Engling used to work at TGI Fridays, became a model, and ended up working in Washington

First on the list is 25-year-old Chicago-born Max Engling, who once slung burgers and fries for TGI Fridays. According to the Hill, Mr Engling was discovered while waiting tables for the casual dining chain.

Double trouble: Julian Malasi, 28, is an identical twin

He worked as a model until 2011, when he realised his true passion lied in politics.

He now works as a staff assistant for the House Administration Committee.

But his days in the service industry aren’t over – after his day job, he heads to a local steak house to wait tables with his wife, Kelcey.

Second on the list is Carolyn Amirpashaie, a Republican originally from Woodbridge, Virginia.

The engaged assistant to Rep. Randy Forbes (R-Virginia) told The Hill that she is often mistaken for a sibling of the Kardashian clan.

Her response is slightly mixed. ‘I’m just like, “Thanks?” I guess it’s the Middle Eastern thing,’ she told the website. Her father is Iranian and her mother hails from Pennsylvania.

Others in the top ten include Kristen Callaway, 24, who works for Rep Steve Southerland (R-Florida), and Warren Wright, 34, a military fellow in the office of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).

Mr Wright was stationed in Kodiak, Alaska for two years as a Coast Guard helicopter pilot, and was shocked that he landed an interview with Sen. Murkowski’s office, saying he had to buy a suit at a Men’s Warehouse in D.C.

All smiles: Former Republican presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann was named the tenth most beautiful person in Washington, in part to her campaign makeover, which included sharper outfits and more styled hair

Then there is Leslie Rath, a 22-year-old Republican who hails from Winterhaven, Florida.

At work, she plans the schedule for Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Arizona), but at play, she enjoys taking her thoroughbred-cross Blondie on fox hunts.

‘We don’t actually kill the fox,’ she explained to The Hill. ‘The whole thing is the chase.’

The light-hearted list caused a stir this year, particularly because of former Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann ranked as the tenth hottest person in Washington.

The Hill discusses the glossy electoral make-over the Minnesota representative underwent for her failed 2012 campaign, noting that women across America took inspiration from her coiffed, shoulder-length blow-out and asked for it at salons.

The also wrote that Mrs Bachmann ‘made noise – literally – wearing a French manicure that clicked and clacked on the podiums of the GOP primary’s many debates.’

The Washington Post’s Reliable Source blog blithely deemed the rankings as ‘superficial and possibly sexist assessments of male and female public servants dedicated to the future of this country.’

The Hill’s editor-in-chief Hugo Gordon told Reliable Source: ‘She is a pretty woman.’

But Mr Gordon said that it all changed when she entered the presidential race. ‘She turned to stylists and enhanced the way she looked. She looked great on the trail.’

In good humour, VanityFair.com compiled a tongue-in-cheek look at the list, citing the 50 most beautiful sentences in The Hill's list.
