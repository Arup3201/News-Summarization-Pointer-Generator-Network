Kevin Pietersen is still on track to play in this summer's Caribbean Premier League for the St Lucia Zouks.

Organisers confirmed the schedule on Tuesday, in a press release which lists Pietersen as one of its stars - alongside West Indies big-hitter Chris Gayle, Martin Guptill and Jacques Kallis among others.

Pietersen negotiated a release from the majority of his Indian Premier League contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad next month and in May so that he could agree a new contract with Surrey.

The superstar batsman, sacked by England last year after their Ashes whitewash defeat, is hoping a return to four-day county cricket may yet pave the way for a Test recall.

New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves has hinted that could be a possibility, if Pietersen performs well.

The 34-year-old has said he will 'do anything' to play for England again, and dreams of being back for this summer's Ashes rematch - a series which runs from July 8 to August 24.

Pietersen agreed in the close season to return to play for the Zouks, as he did last summer.

His commitments for them may, however, clash with part of the Ashes - or his hopes of continuing to press his claims with runs for Surrey.

The CPL season begins on June 20 and ends on July 26 and the tournament's international director of cricket, Tom Moody, is confident Pietersen will be there.

'At this stage he sees himself very much as part of the CPL, he's made the commitment and will have played a lot of county cricket at that time,' he told the CPL's official website.

'We don't see that changing, he hasn't indicated that's going to be the case (to pull out) but if he's suddenly picked in an Ashes Test match that's all going to change very quickly.

'I think that is probably not a realistic target for him unless something dramatic happens between now and then. It's going to be hard for him, there's a lot of hurdles to be overcome; one, form, which will be his easiest hurdle; two, his fitness and three is his building bridges. There are many to be built after what has been said from both parties over a long period of time.'
