The head of an Oklahoma Indian tribe is being accused of physical abuse of his mistress and spearheaded a massive cover-up.

Johnna Townsend filed a lawsuit Monday in an Oklahoma court against George Tiger, principal chief of the Muscogee (Creek) Indian Nation and two of his brothers detailing the affair and alleged abuse, as well as harassment from family members who learned of the affair.

The charges leveled in the lawsuit include assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and false imprisonment, according to the Tulsa World.

Townsend has accused Tiger of throwing her to the ground and wrestling a phone from her hands shortly after she threatened to call his wife about the affair in one of many instances of abuse, reported the World.

Additionally, tribe Attorney General Roger Wiley and Dennis Northcross, patrol captain, Lighthorse Tribal Police, are accused of helping their brother Tiger cover-up both the alleged incidences of abuse and the affair itself.

‘My focus is going to be just continuing to work on the positive things for the Muscogee (Creek) Nation,’ Tiger said when contacted by the World for comment on the suit, then declining when pressed for more information.

Townsend's attorney told the paper that his client spent years in ‘a turbulent and emotionally manipulative relationship with Tiger,’ adding ‘she thought she was in love, and for him it was a game throughout.’

Additional harassment accusations have also been leveled against Kendra Root and Molly Moore, also relatives of Tiger.

Among the occurrences of harassment cited in the suit, Moore and Root sandwiched Townsend’s vehicle between them, driving in two separate cars, the World reported.

The spurned mistress asked for an order of protection against the two women and subpoenaed her former lover to appear at a hearing for the order – Lighthorse Tribal Police refused to serve the order, according to the World.

Wiley explained the tribe’s resistance in a letter to the local county clerk, which Townsend characterized as part of the ‘cover up for the personal misdeeds of George (Tiger) and Kendra (Root),’ reported the World.

‘The Muscogee (Creek) Nation is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma Courts and is not required, absent an order from the Muscogee (Creek) Nation District Court to give full faith and credit to the Okmulgee County subpoena,’ said the letter, according to the World.

Tiger denied to the paper he had been served a subpoena, saying ‘I haven’t seen any paperwork.’

Townsend once worked as a consultant for the Muscogee tribe, both for the Indian nation’s housing division and Tiger personally.
