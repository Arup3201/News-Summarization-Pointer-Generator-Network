When Peter Hammond started breeding parrots at his home, he didn’t expect a squawk of protest from his neighbours.

His rural property was a noisy pig farm until recently, and there are other farms in the area. But his hobby has split the village – with angry neighbours complaining of sleepless nights and stress.

Now Mr Hammond’s critics appear to have won the battle to have the birds removed, after the local council ruled he had to rehome all of them within six months.

The 76-year-old insists he only has around 200 parrots, but neighbours have claimed he in fact keeps up to 500.

Some villagers are overjoyed by the ruling, while others simply cannot understand what all the fuss is about.

Sarah Griffiths, 47, who lives four doors away and has been leading the campaign against the exotic birds, said the decision was an ‘enormous relief’.

‘The parrots, some of them macaws, emit what can only be described as alarming, primeval squawks at random intervals, sometimes for several hours,’ she said.

‘Every member of my family and most of our neighbours have suffered directly because of Mr Hammond’s hobby. We have gone to work exhausted and I have sent my children to school tired.’

Neighbours said the noise sometimes begins as early as 5am.

One claimed to have been so stressed by the racket that they took six months off work.

But church pastor Graham Steward and his wife Gwen, who live opposite, said they were not bothered at all by the birds.

‘When I wake up early in the morning the noise of the pigeons is more of a nuisance,’ said Mr Steward, who is in his 50s.

‘There were pigs in the outbuildings before the farmer who lived there retired.

‘I am quite happy for the parrots to remain. Sometimes when they are being fed they make a bit of a noise but they are certainly not a problem to us.’

Matters came to a head on Wednesday when Mid Suffolk District Council considered retrospective planning permission that Mr Hammond, a widowed former game farmer, was told to submit following complaints.

His application to change the use of his agricultural buildings was turned down. Mr Hammond’s daughter, Angela Berry, attended the meeting and said her father had built a 10ft-high, 4ft-deep straw bale wall in 2013 to dampen the noise. 

But Chris Knock, Battisford Parish Council chairman, said members felt Mr Hammond had not gone through the proper procedures before acquiring so many parrots. He added: ‘It was not just a few birds. There were far more than someone would normally have as pets.'
