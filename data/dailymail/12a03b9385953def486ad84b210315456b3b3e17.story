A South African teacher fired after taking three pupils to get penis piercings has apologised, saying that he was 'stupid and naive'.

Pieter Oberholzer, 57, the former head of drama at Willowridge High School in Pretoria, was dismissed after taking three pupils - two of whom were over 18 and one who was almost 16 - to get the intimate piercings.

He said there was nothing sexual about the incident, adding that the boys involved wanted one after they saw his own penis ring while he was in the shower after swimming practice.

He told South African paper The Star: 'We were preparing for Midmar (Mile swimming race) and I had a shoulder injury so I went to shower to warm up.

'Two of the boys wanted to check on me and walked in while I was drying my hair and I immediately covered up.'

He said the pupils 'hounded him' for months about helping them before he finally decided to help them find a reputable piercing studio.

He added: 'I agree 100 percent that I should not have got involved, I was trying to make sure they were safe. The guys threatened to pierce themselves. I’m also terribly sorry for the stress it has caused my family and friends.'

A few days after the piercings took place he realised his mistake and informed the headteacher and the boys' parents.

None of the parents pressed charges but the incident was reported to the local education board and Oberholzer was sacked after a disciplinary hearing.

He was also found to have given some of his students penis-shaped pasta and allowing them to bunk classes, according to The Star.
