Phil Simms almost keep his promise not to say Washington's name during their Thursday night matchup against New York but was tripped up late in the game.

The Giants legend had announced last month he would not say 'Redskins' and only use 'Washington' during CBS broadcasts, where he's lead analyst calling games with Jim Nantz.

He reiterated his decision before the game, but said he wasn't taking a stand against supporters of the current name.

Sympathy: Former Giants quarterback and CBS analyst Phil Simms said his decision not to say Washington's name was out of 'sympathy' for those offended

'It offends a certain group of people and I have sympathy for them,' Simms told MMQB. 'So I can have sympathy for them and I am not denigrating the other side.'

Simms danced around the name for most of the matchup, which saw the Giants pick off quarterback Kirk Cousins four times before going on to win 45-14.

Still Simms, who played 20 games against Washington as quarterback for New York, reflexively let one slip late in the game as Washington attempted to mount some offense in their losing effort.

'Can the Redskins ... can the Washington offensive line hang in there and block?' 

The name was also said plenty in the booth by Simms's broadcast partner Jim Nantz, whose response to the controversy was that it's 'not my job to take a stance.'

Fans held up anti-Phil Simms fans emblazoned with the slogan 'Keep the Name,' which is also the name of a fan group supporting the Redskins name. 

Few commentators have decided to drop the name like Simms, alternatively considered a slur and a neutral term for Native Americans.

Loss: During the game, 'Skins QB Kirk Cousins threw four interceptions, with three in the third quarter, allowing the Giants to runaway with the game 

Legendary: Phil Simms spent 14 years in New York where he played Washington 20 times and led the Giants to 2 Super Bowl wins

Earlier this month, the New York Daily News announced the name would not appear in their articles, and created a symbol using the team's uniform colors to replace the Native American logo.

NBC's Tony Dungy, who was the first African-American coach to win a Super Bowl, also said he would drop the name.

'I will personally try not to use Redskins and refer to them as Washington,' he told the Associated Press.

In polls, Americans overwhelmingly support keeping the name. Public Policy Polling conducted a December 2013 survey that found 71 percent of Americans wanted Washington to keep the name.

The poll also found that support of the name among African Americans was 64 percent and Hispanics only 49 percent.

CBS bought the rights to Thursday night games this season with Nantz and Simms working the booth.
