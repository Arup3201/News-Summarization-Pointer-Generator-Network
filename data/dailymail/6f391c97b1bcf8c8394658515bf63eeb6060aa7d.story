Darren Fletcher's move away from Manchester United is set to go ahead despite a dispute over a pay-off.

Sportsmail understands the club have told the player's agent that they will allow the long-serving Scotland midfielder, whose contract expires at the end of the season, to leave on a free in this transfer window.

They are also known to be happy for Fletcher, who turns 31 on Monday, to see out the remainder of his deal at Old Trafford.

However, it is unlikely United will both pay-up the remainder of the contract AND waive their right to a transfer fee.

Officials believe that not asking for a fee is a sufficient gesture of goodwill towards Fletcher, who is nearing a 20th anniversary with the club he signed for as an 11-year-old.

West Ham United are keen on bringing the player to Upton Park but whether they are able to bridge the gap and pay the equivalent of what he would have earned at United is unclear.

Despite the above, however, a move away from the club is likely to take place in the near future.

Fletcher was named vice-captain by Louis van Gaal following the Dutchman's arrival at United but has struggled for playing time.

The acquisitions of Angel di Maria and Daley Blind have limited his opportunities and he will not be offered a new deal at the club.

This season Fletcher has started just four Premier League matches and was replaced as vice-captain by Michael Carrick in December.

Aside from West Ham, West Bromwich Albion and Valencia are interested parties.

A return to United in a coaching or ambassadorial role is an option, but this would not happen until his playing days are over.
