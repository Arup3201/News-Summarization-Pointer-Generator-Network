Once a year, millions of people make room in their lives for The X Factor.

But for Jade Jones, it is a rather more permanent obsession.

For two years, she has queued up to get the judges to sign her arms - before turning the scribbles into tattoos.

Superfan: Jade Jones, 24, has spent two years queuing up to get The X Factor's judges' signatures on her arms

The big one: Finally, she flagged down the show's creator Simon Cowell to get what she deems a complete set

Finally, she has added the show's face and creator Simon Cowell to her almost-complete collection - much to his bemusement.

The 24-year-old, from Llanelli, south Wales, already has Nicole Scherzinger, Gary Barlow, Louis Walsh, Sharon Osborne, Caroline Flack and Dermot O'Leary etched into her skin.

Branding Cheryl irrelevant, Miss Jones was only after one more.

Finally, standing behind the railings at the Cardiff auditions for Britain's Got Talent, she flagged down the TV mogul and told him about her unusual quest.

Explanation: She explained her unusual quest to Simon, who responding with 'But...why?' - before signing

Special touch: Miss Jones added a crown to Simon's scribble because 'he's the daddy of it all'

Puzzled Cowell replied: 'But why?'

Despite mocking her with a teasing laugh, Simon was more than happy to pen his name on her right arm.

She said: 'Now I feel my tattoos are complete - Simon was always the one to get.

'He’s the Daddy of the show and the boss. It’s his autograph I’ve wanted all along.

Delighted: Simon laughed at her, and her friends and family think she's mad, but Miss Jones loves her collection

Inked: The embellishments are a sign of her ultimate devotion to the reality show, Miss Jones said

'I saved a spot, pride of place for his signature.

'I showed him the others and he laughed at me but still signed his name.'

Claiming she loves the show 'more than anything', Miss Jones said: 'My friends and family might think I’m mad, but I had the tattoos to show off my devotion to the show.'
