An 11-year-old boy has been charged in connection with the death of his baby brother after he allegedly confessed to dropping the infant because he was jealous.

The unidentified child is facing a felony child abuse charge in the November 9 death of six-month-old Kamdyn Barnell Johnson, authorities said Thursday.

The children's mother, Wendy Latwann Johnson, 33, was charged earlier this week with involuntary manslaughter and child abuse causing serious bodily injury in the death of her child.

According to a police report, officers were called to a home on the 6300 block of Suntrace Way in Charlotte, North Carolina, and found the infant unresponsive.

The child was transported to Carolinas Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

An autopsy revealed the baby suffered a 'subgaleal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic to the right eye, injuries to both cheeks, forehead, nose, back of the head, lip, and has a torn frenulum.'

Johnson was arrested Monday and placed in the Mecklenburg County Jail on $200,000 bond.

Johnson's mother Debra Sanders told WBTV
that her daughter had left the baby in the care of her 11-year-old son 
when the infant was killed, but she hadn't been gone long.

She
said her grandson gave a taped confession to police Monday night and 
told officers he picked up the baby and dropped him. She said the boy, 
who has a tendency to be jealous, demonstrated what happened using a 
doll.

Sanders admitted Johnson made a 'poor
judgment' but said she was devastated by the incident and angry and 
hurt her daughter has been charged in the case.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Police Department's Homicide Captain Cecil Brisbon confirmed to the TV station on Thursday that 'the mother was not home during the time of the 
actual event.'

He said after Johnson was arrested, detectives 'continued the investigation and determined the juvenile was also responsible and charged him as well.'

Brisbon said that he can't say who's responsible for the list of injuries, but that 'Ultimately there's a level of responsibility and accountability that also lies with the parent in this case.'

He added: 'Understandably, the grandmother is upset with her daughter being charged... However, it goes back to what I've said before - we charge based on the total picture. We charge everyone that's responsible in all cases.'

Johnson has been issued a public defender and will have a bond hearing next week and a probable cause hearing at the start of December.
