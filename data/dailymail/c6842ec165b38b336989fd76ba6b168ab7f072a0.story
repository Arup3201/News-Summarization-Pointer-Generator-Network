The London house boom has left the rest of the country behind, with some areas even registering price falls.

Land Registry figures show the average price in the capital was up by 10.6 per cent in November compared to a year ago, taking it to £396,646.

The average London property price has increased by £38,000 in just 12 months – the equivalent of £730 a week.

Across England and Wales, prices rose by 3.2 per cent on average over the year – but this figure masks falls in the North.

The
 average price in the North East was down by 1.6 per cent in a year to 
£96,227, while the North West was up by just 0.8 per cent to £109,692.

At
 the same time, there were rises of 1.4 per cent in the East Midlands 
and 1.6 per cent in the Yorkshire and Humber region – both below the 
increase in the general  cost of living.

Property prices in London have boomed amid an economic recovery in the city and an influx of wealthy foreigners.

They have also been boosted by a raft of government schemes designed to encourage home ownership and mortgage lending.

But the data from the Land Registry makes clear that there is no price bubble beyond the M25.

Even in the South of England, the average annual increase is just 3.5 per cent.

The upturn in the housing market is said
 to have boosted consumer confidence, but there have also been fears 
that people are being encouraged to stretch themselves too far 
financially to meet rising prices.

There have also been signs of ‘gazumping’ - which happens when a buyer thinks they have agreed a deal to buy a house only for someone else to step in and outbid them - being back on the increase in the capital.

The South East saw the second largest annual jump in house prices, with a 3.5 per cent increase taking typical values to £216,618.

Meanwhile, Wales recorded a 3.3 per cent annual increase in house prices, pushing them to £118,310 on average.

Surge: Prices in London rose by 10.6% annually to reach £396,646 on average

The East saw the most significant monthly price fall with a 0.7 per cent drop taking average prices to £177,975.

The Land Registry’s latest figures also showed how house sales have been much stronger than in the same period last year.

The most up-to-date figures available show that during September 2013, the number of completed house sales in England and Wales increased by 24 per cent to 65,378 compared with 52,870 in September 2012.

The housing market has consistently shown a strong pick-up throughout 2013 following the introduction of Government schemes such as Help to Buy, which have given mortgage borrowers with small deposits a helping hand on or up the housing ladder.

Mark Harris, chief executive of 
mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘With funding more readily 
available than at any time in the past five years, many buyers are 
finally able to realise their property-ownership dream.‘

He
 added: ‘This surge in demand is pushing up prices, particularly in 
London, where supply is already limited. Gazumping and sealed bids are 
becoming commonplace as relatively ordinary properties fetch a premium.

House prices: The only region to see property values drop in 2013 was the North East, which fell by 1.6%

Business Secretary Vince Cable has warned the £130billion project, which provides lower deposits and loans, could ‘inflate the market’ and push property prices even further out of reach of young families.

Despite protestations from George Osborne, the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Institute of Directors have weighed in, claiming there is no doubt house prices will be driven up.

Branding the scheme 'mad' and 'very dangerous', Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘The housing market needs help to supply, not Help to Buy, and the extension of this scheme is very dangerous.’

And experts warn young first-time buyers will bear the brunt of the side-effects, such as unavoidable administration costs.

Many buyers are worried that if they don’t take the plunge now, they will be priced out further.’

Mr Harris said that locking into a fixed-rate mortgage deal could help give ‘peace of mind’ to some people who are worried about the prospect of interest rates rising.

He added: ‘There are still plenty of rock-bottom mortgage deals available, with some particularly good pricing on five-year fixed rates.’
