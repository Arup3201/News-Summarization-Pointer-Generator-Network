Chelsea have confirmed they made a written offer for Wayne Rooney but Manchester United rejected their sensational opening bid.

Sportsmail understands the initial offer on Tuesday was £10million cash plus David Luiz or Juan Mata but Chelsea deny involving the two players in their bid.

The London club then returned with a second offer of £22m outright - but that was also rejected by United, who told their Barclays Premier League rivals not come back with another offer.

Something on your mind? Wayne Rooney arrives at Manchester United's training ground on Wednesday

David Moyes's first home game in charge of Manchester United is against... you guessed it, Chelsea on August 26.

Will Rooney line up against his former side or will he be made to sweat until the transfer window closes on September 2?

United have insisted Rooney is not for sale and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho must now decide whether to submit a fresh offer.

A statement from Chelsea read: ‘Chelsea 
FC can confirm that yesterday it made a written offer to Manchester 
United for the transfer of Wayne Rooney.'

But in another twist, Chelsea appeared to suggest that Sportsmail's story came from United's training camp in Sydney. 

The statement continued: 'Although the terms of the offer are confidential, for the avoidance of doubt and to the contrary to what appears to be being briefed to the press in Sydney, the purchase price does not include the transfer or loan of any players from Chelsea to Manchester United.’

United insist they have not briefed the press on this story but simply confirmed the bid had been made.

Chelsea have been 
warned, however, not to return with a second bid as United have no 
intention of selling Rooney to another Premier League club.

Up for grabs? Chelsea have offered Juan Mata (above) or David Luiz (below) in part-exchange for Rooney

Arsenal have already made an initial 
enquiry and remain in the frame despite also making offers for Luis 
Suarez and Gonzalo Higuain.

Mourinho is willing to sell Mata and Luiz and hoped the inclusion of one of them in a deal would tempt United to sell up.

Meanwhile, United's chief executive Ed 
Woodward has left the club's tour of Australia to try to secure Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona.

Rooney feels he is at the peak of his career and has nothing to prove after nine seasons at Old Trafford.

The England forward is understood to be ‘angry and confused’ over comments by new manager 
David Moyes that he will not be sold because he provides important 
back-up for first-choice striker Robin van Persie.

The offending words were delivered to Sunday newspaper journalists during a briefing with Moyes in Bangkok last week.

Moyes
said: ‘Overall, my thought on Wayne is that if for any reason we had an
injury to Robin van Persie we are going to need him and I want as many 
options as possible.’

Uncertain future: Rooney was overshadowed by Robin van Persie (below) at United last season

Since returning from United’s tour of 
the Far East and Australia for treatment on a hamstring injury last 
week, the 27-year-old has made his feelings known to the club.

He has re-iterated his desire to leave —
having issued a similar message to Sir Alex Ferguson last season — and 
is now prepared to put in a formal transfer request.

Rooney
wants to go this summer with the World Cup less than a year away, and 
sources close to the player say he has no intention of allowing his 
career to go backwards by being a squad member or playing second fiddle 
to Van Persie.

Moyes faces a quandary now the player has raised the stakes but there seems little chance of him staying.

United have already discussed the possible
scenarios and believe that out of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris 
Saint-Germain, the French champions would be their preferred buyer.

Mourinho added more fuel to his interest
in Rooney on Tuesday by warning that England’s World Cup hopes could 
suffer if he stays at United.

Chelsea appear to have settled on Rooney 
as their main target after losing out on Radamel Falcao to Monaco and 
Edinson Cavani to PSG.

Mourinho said: ‘If Wayne is a second choice for Manchester United, then the national team will be affected.’

He also said that Rooney is 'a player I like very, very much.'

He added: 'Being fast and direct, I like him very much but he’s a United player. From an ethical point of view I can’t speak about players from other teams.'

Big fan: Jose Mourinho has not tried to hide his admiration for Rooney as he tries to bring him to Chelsea

Those comments forced Moyes to reaffirm his stance that he would not sell a player he brought through at Everton.

'Unless I was speaking double Dutch last week, we said Wayne is not for sale,' he insisted.

'It’s hard to keep repeating myself but I will — Wayne is a United player and it will remain that way.

'Jose said in his comments that he doesn’t normally talk about other players. But it does happen.'

Rooney must now consider whether he takes the next step and puts in a transfer request. He arrived at Carrington on Wednesday morning as he recovers from his slight hamstring injury along with Nani, Nemanja Vidic and Nick Powell.
