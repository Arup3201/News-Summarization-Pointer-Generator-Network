This is the horrific moment a zebra foal fell prey to a float of crocodiles after stumbling at the last minute crossing the Mara River in Kenya.

The frail youngster had waited with the rest of its herd until it was safe to cross the stream.

But when they finally took the plunge, the foal lost his footing in the deeper water and became isolated from the group.

Tragic: Almost at the other side of the Mara River in Kenya, this young foal slipped away from his herd and was captured by a preying crocodile

Within seconds, three more emerged from the murky water to pull the foal into their clutches as the rest of the herd could do nothing but flee

Before any of its cousins could turn around, the zebra was pulled into the river by one of the looming tetrapods.

It was a tragic end to a meticulous river crossing that lasted almost an hour.

Zimbabwe-born amateur photographer Michael Olsen, who captured the event in the Maasai Mara National Reserve described how close the foal came to escaping.

Mr Olsen, 60, said: 'It was an incredibly tense situation 
in which obviously we were hoping that all the zebra would make the 
crossing safely. They nearly did.

Waiting: The herd of dozens were at first drinking the water from the river in Maasai Mara National Reserve

Calculating: They had to cross to continue their migration to Tanzania in search of fresh grazing, but spent almost an hour biding their time to move at the right moment

'It
was quite amazing to watch the way in which the zebra communicated as a
herd when preparing for the crossing and also seeing the ambush 
strategy of the crocodiles in action.'

Led by a mature zebra stallion, nicknamed 'Captain Courageous' by Mr Olsen, the herd had to cross the river in order to continue their migration to Tanzania in search of fresh grazing.

Operating on the principle that there is safety in numbers, the zebras waited until the herd numbers had swelled to a significant number to make the crossing en masse.

Tightly-formed group: They meticulously filed into the stream close together to form a protective line that would be difficult for crocodiles to break into safely

After patrolling the river bank to find the best crossing spot, 'Captain Courageous' swam to the far shore - then bravely returned to the north bank after realising that the rest of the herd had failed to follow his lead after getting spooked by a hippo.

However, the herd committed to the second crossing and they filed into the water in two distinct lines, following each other closely for safety.

'The crocs had taken up ambush positions in the river above and below the crossing point,' Mr Olsen, currently based in Accra, Ghana, said.

'There were a few unsuccessful attempts made by the crocs to grab a zebra and a few extremely close escapes.

Two lines: As this group plough through the deep water, others trot further up stream to form a similar line to complete the operation quickly while their predators are at bay

Slipped: But this is the moment a baby zebra at the back of the line lost its footing in the deep water and fumbled to clamber to safety

'There were also a number of crocs who were certainly trampled under the frenzied hooves of the zebra.'

Most of the animals had completed the crossing when suddenly one of the younger zebra foals lost his footing in the deeper water, drifting from the protection of the line.

Within a second, the crocodile launched, snapping its powerful jaws over the muzzle, breaking its bones instantly, before dragging the zebra foal beneath the water.

Attack: As if out of nowhere, the predator leaps up from beneath the murky water and wraps its jaws around the young zebra's head, despite its attempts to turn away

Moving: Mr Olsen said the moment was difficult to watch as such a young animal fell prey to a calculating crocodile

'We felt very helpless and sad to see how a vulnerable young animal can so easily become prey,' Mr Olsen added.

'As soon as it became separated from the safety of the crossing line it was attacked - all it took was one mistake.

'We left in a very sombre mood. The reality of nature can be quite harsh.

'The zebra were so focused on surviving the crossing amidst the threat of the crocodiles - they just carried on, while the crocodiles went into a complete feeding frenzy - floating downstream and out of sight like a raft.'
