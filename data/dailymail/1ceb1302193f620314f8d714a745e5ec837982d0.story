Oxford University beat Cambridge by a length and a half to win the 159th BNY Mellon Boat Race.

The Dark Blues, who won the toss and opted for the Surrey station, made a strong start and finally broke a spirited Cambridge effort just as the river turned towards the finish at Barnes Bridge.

Twelve months ago, Oxford lost amid one of the most dramatic and controversial Boat Races in history.

Today, the race was clean and tightly fought with no swimming protesters or broken oars.

A crew featuring Olympic medalist Constantine Louloudis stormed the final stretch in a race which lasted 17 minutes 27 seconds to cut Cambridge's overall lead to 81-77.

Oxford's
 Constantine Louloudis said: 'It was a heck of a race. We fancied our 
chances but Cambridge made it very difficult for us, we had to push 
hard.'

This year, the tensions was such that 
presenters were forced to apologise after one of the crew  was heard 
shouting f*** on air during the heated race.

Last year Oxford bowman Alex Woods collapsed during the Boat Race but returned to win with Isis this year.

He told BBC Sport he was 'always proud to see the Blue Boat win'.

He added: 'It is hard to put into words what the Boat Race means to me and I am proud of myself coming back and trying again.'

Organisers
were anxious to prevent any repeat of last year when the annual race had
 to be halted after Australian Trenton Oldfield swam into the path of 
the Oxford and Cambridge university crews, narrowly avoiding being 
struck by an oar.

After a 40-minute delay, the race was won by Cambridge, but it had long since descended into farce.

Marines had today been monitoring eight miles of the River Thames in inflatable boats, and police have been monitoring Twitter for any signs of  planned disruption to the event.

The 25-year-old American cox said 'It was fun, tough, but that was what we expected'

Boat Race executive director David Searle said: 'We are taking additional measures this year and have reviewed all of our actions last year in detail.

'The Boat Race course is four and a quarter miles long so we have eight and a half miles of riverbank to manage and monitor.

'What I would say to anybody thinking of disrupting the race is that it's unbelievably dangerous. You risk injuring yourself, the crews and the other people following the race.

'Nobody wants that to happen. This is just a sporting event.'

Oxford emerged as clear 
favourites to win the race after more than 70 per cent of bets were 
placed on the Dark Blues, according to bookmaker William Hill.

Oldfield, 36, was released from prison in December after he served seven weeks of a six-month sentence after being found guilty of causing a public nuisance.

He has since been contacted by the Metropolitan Police by letter and on Twitter to establish whether he was planning any action this year, saying they were 'keen to facilitate any peaceful protest'.

In a statement, the police stressed they were not offering to organise a protest but to afford him the opportunity to exercise his 'lawful rights without causing disruption or danger to themselves or others'.

However, Oldfield told The Spectator he would 'probably have a ramble across the Cotswolds instead'.
