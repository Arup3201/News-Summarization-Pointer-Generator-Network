Pregnant women should eat more fish after all, research suggests.

They are usually advised to restrict consumption amid fears over mercury, which builds up in oily fish.

The metal can damage the brain of unborn children. This has led to mothers-to-be being advised by the Food Standards Agency to limit the amount of tuna, mackerel, sardines, salmon and trout they eat, and to avoid shark, swordfish and marlin altogether.

Warning: The Food Standards Agency had previously advised mothers-to-be not to eat fish like mackerel, pictured, because of the metal

But a large-scale British study  suggests that concerns over mercury levels in fish may be unfounded.

With fish credited as having numerous health benefits, the researchers said they hope that ‘many more women will now consider eating fish during pregnancy’ – although the FSA said that its advice remains unchanged.

The researchers compared mercury levels in blood samples from more than 4,000 pregnant women from the Bristol area with information about their diet and lifestyle.

Fish accounted for only 7 per cent of the mercury in the women’s bodies, and food and drink accounted for 17 per cent. Other sources of the toxic metal include air pollution, dental fillings and pesticides.

Overall, only 38 of the women – fewer than 1 per cent – had mercury levels higher than the maximum  recommended by the US National Research Council. There is no official safe level in the UK. The study  concluded that advice to pregnant women to limit seafood intake is unlikely to reduce their mercury  levels substantially.

Professor Jean Golding, lead author of the report published in Environmental Health Perspectives, said: ‘We were pleasantly surprised to find that fish contributes such a small amount to blood mercury levels.

‘We have previously found that eating fish during pregnancy has many health benefits for both mother and child. We hope many more women will now consider eating more fish during pregnancy.’

Professor Charles Kingsland, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ‘Fish is a valuable nutrient and is something we wouldn’t tell patients to avoid because it is full of mercury.

‘We’d say to eat more of it because it is full of omega-3 oils and all things that are good for you.’

But the Food Standard Agency said its advice stands. A spokesman said: ‘Most people do not eat enough fish. However, children, pregnant women and women who are trying to get pregnant should not eat shark, marlin or swordfish. If you are trying for a baby or are pregnant, you should have no more than four cans of tuna a week. Mackerel, sardines, salmon and trout should not be eaten more than twice a week.’

The study also found that herbal teas were linked to higher mercury levels in the blood, perhaps due to contamination. Wine appeared to raise mercury levels more than beer.

However, women who ate lots of chips and white bread tended to have lower levels.

But results of large-scale study have questioned this theory

Other food and drink accounted for 17%

Dental fillings and air pollution are also sources of the toxic metal
