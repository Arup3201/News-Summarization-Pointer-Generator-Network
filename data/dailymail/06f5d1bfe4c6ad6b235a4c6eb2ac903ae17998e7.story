Scientists at Svalbard have successfully used instruments to observe the total solar eclipse - in the hope of solving one of the sun’s biggest mysteries.

For some reason, the corona of the sun - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - is a lot hotter than the surface, and no one is sure why.

But by observing the atmosphere of the sun around the eclipse, astronomers will be hoping to solve this mystery once and for all.

In a blog post, research student Nathalia Alzate from Aberystwyth University, who is part of the team conducting the research, said that everything had gone as planned.

‘What a show! Observatory doors open, special glasses ready, cameras, all of us standing in the cold, waiting for the moment of truth,’ she said.

‘Those two minutes of eclipse time brought us all here and connected us. Time to look at our data!’

A total solar eclipse is the only time that the entire atmosphere of the sun can be observed.

Why is the sun’s corona - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - so much hotter than its surface?

That is one of greatest solar mysteries, but astronomers will be hoping to find an answer today - by observing the total solar eclipse from the North Pole.

The plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse, so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena.

Some Nasa spacecraft have a ‘coronograph’ on board, which lets them block part of the sun and create an artificial eclipse, but the effect pales in comparison to viewing the atmosphere of the sun around the moon.

At Svalbard, including fellow research student Joe Hutton from the university, measured radiation before, during and after the eclipse.

They used a high-tech particle camera developed by the Cern@school programme to measure changes in radiation.

Cern@school also provided similar detectors at schools across the UK, to measure changes in radiation from the eclipse at varying degrees of totality.

In Svalbard, 100 per cent of the sun was covered by the moon, but much further south in London, only about 85 per cent was obscured. 

And in an amazing coincidence, the eclipse occurred over Svalbard in the North Pole on the same day the sun came into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years.

The team at Svalbard (shown), led by Professor Shadia Habbal, Professor of Solar Physics at the University of Hawaii, included scientists from Aberystwyth University in Wales. They joined scientists from the US, Czech Republic and Germany as part of the 'Solar Wind Sherpas'

The team of scientists worked at an old observatory on Svalbard, midway between continental Norway and the North Pole.

They travelled to this region to ensure they saw totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse.

For observers in other regions, such as the UK, less than 90 per cent of the sun was covered.

Up to 14 specially adapted cameras were used to photograph the sun in different frequencies during the eclipse, capturing images of the plasma from the corona.

In so doing, they will hope to solve the sun’s greatest mystery. 

The temperature of the sun is known to be around 6,000°C (10,800°F), but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000°C (1,800,000°F), and even reaches 2,000,000°C (3,600,000°F) in some areas.

This factor of 300 difference would be akin to the flame of a fire being 300 times colder than the air around it - but why this is occurring is unknown.

One potential reason could be magnetic forces on the sun, with superheated gas creating a strong magnetic field and funnelling energy into the corona, but this has not yet been confirmed.

Data and images taken during the eclipse will be used to try and develop a mathematical model to understand this difference in temperature.

'The difference between the temperature of the sun and that of the sun’s corona is one of the great mysteries of astronomy,’ said Dr Huw Morgan, a Reader at the Solar System Physics Group at Aberystwyth University, who is overseeing the team’s work from the UK.

‘A total eclipse gives us an unique opportunity to measure the corona of the sun is so much detail and collect data that will enable us to better understand this difference.'

He also added that studying the corona could help protect satellite-based communication systems from solar storms, which can be affected by coronal mass ejections - huge eruptions of material - from the sun. 

The temperature of the sun's surface (shown ion this Nasa image) is known to be around 6,000°C (10,800°F), but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000°C (1,800,000°F), and even reaches 2,000,000°C (3,600,000°F) in some areas, a factor of about 300
