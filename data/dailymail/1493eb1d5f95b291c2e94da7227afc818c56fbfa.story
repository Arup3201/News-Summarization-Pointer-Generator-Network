The distraught wife of an ANZ banker who was involved in a road accident in Papua New Guinea earlier this month has revealed she wanted to stop after 'clipping' a seven-year-old girl on the Poreporena Freeway but couldn't as she was fearful for her own life.

Belinda Coleman - whose husband Gareth was the ANZ Head of Supply and Chain in Port Moresby - was driving along the busy road on May 7 when Serah Kevin ran out in front of her vehicle and collided with her side mirror.

The seven-year-old, who was fleeing from an 'attacker', was knocked down and then run over by a second car, suffering two broken legs. The Coleman family was flown back to Australia immediately over fears of a 'targeted revenge attack' by locals.

Agony: Serah Kevin was knocked to the ground and then run over by another vehicle after she collided with Belinda Coleman's side mirror on May 7. She suffered two broken legs as a result

Horror: Serah's mother Belsy was seen wailing with grief as her daughter lay severely injured on the Poreporena Freeway in Port Moresby

Distressed: ANZ executive banker Gareth Coleman said his family had suffered a traumatic ordeal after they were forced to flee PNG

'I'm traumatised, I'm sickened at what's happened,' she told MailOnline.

'There was a road accident that I had no control over...she was running from an attacker, she was frightened, she was scared. It could have been your wife, it could have been your daughter, it could have been you in the car.'

Mrs Coleman said the girl dropped a thong in the middle of the road and turned back to retrieve it when she was accidentally clipped by her vehicle.

'I'm saddened that I lived in a country that I loved where it was too dangerous to stop,' Mrs Coleman said.

'As a mother, my heart breaks...I did everything I was told to do.'

Carnage: AFP officers, on patrol with local cops, were among the first to respond to the accident and were forced to use sticks as makeshift braces

Revenge: ANZ bank flew the Colemans home immediately over fears of a 'targeted revenge attack' by an angry Papua New Guinean community

In PNG, Australian expatriates are instructed by security experts never to stop on the side of the road after a traffic incident due to the threat posed by locals.

Mrs Coleman followed protocol by driving to ANZ headquarters and informing her husband, who passed on details of the crash to officials.

'This is standard practice in PNG in terms of leaving the country after being involved in anything. To be frank, it wasn't a pleasant experience but it's par for the course,' said Gareth Coleman.

'You leave for your own safety.'

Crime scene: AFP officers only provide 'advice' to the local police force and are not involved in the official investigation into the crash

Medical emergency: Serah Kevin has since undergone surgery, paid for by ANZ, and has corroborated Mrs Coleman's version of events

Mr Coleman said it is made 'explicitly clear' not to stop after road accidents and instead to go to the nearest point of safety.

'My wife is very, very upset...distraught,' he added.

'(Over) the fact that she was unable to stop.

'What happened was incredibly unfortunate and both parties have suffered as a result. The young girl has physical injuries and my wife has gone through an ordeal of her own.

Powerless: Belinda Coleman said she had 'no control' over the May 7 incident that left Serah Kevin with horrific injuries

'It's deeply distressing and we are encouraged by the progress of the young girl.'

Young Serah's medical bills have been paid for by the ANZ bank and it is understood she has corroborated Mrs Coleman's version of events.

An ANZ spokesman told MailOnline Mr Coleman would remain as an employee of the bank.

PNG traffic inspector Philip Koliadi told MailOnline police were talking to 'two very close eyewitnesses' as their investigation into the crash continues.

The driver of the vehicle which ran over Serah has not yet been found.
