Plans to make teenage boys and girls share school toilets have been condemned by children’s campaigner Esther Rantzen.

The ChildLine founder said the proposal for unisex toilets at a school  in Kent was ‘one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard’.

The move will mean that girls as young as 11 will share the bathroom facilities with 16-year-old boys.

Parents at The Towers School in Ashford, which has 1,400 pupils, believe the plans will remove pupils’ privacy and provide an environment for bullying. And they fear the plans could lead to children having sex in the toilets.

But the school governors have given their backing to the scheme and claim it will cut down on vandalism.

Ms Rantzen said: 'These children are at an age when they are extremely self-conscious and aware of their bodies and the changes they experience'

‘These children are at an age when they are extremely self-conscious and aware of their bodies and the changes they experience,’ said Ms Rantzen.

‘It’s an extremely delicate time for them and one would hope that a school would seek to make them as comfortable as possible. This is one of the worst ideas I’ve ever heard and I suggest the school rethinks its proposal.’

Parent Daniel Gray, 39, said: ‘Many parents are upset that the school has dreamt up these proposals without consulting them. Some girls will be  as young as 11 and experiencing puberty – not something to be shared with teenage boys as old as 16.

‘I think it is a bit much to ask teenagers to be responsible enough to give each other privacy. Girls in particular need privacy and there will be boys calling at them over the cubicle doors.

‘Teenagers are full of hormones and I’m sure this will encourage them to canoodle in the loos – whether it’s heavy petting or worse.’

Designs for two shared toilet areas have been posted on a school noticeboard, one with 11 cubicles for females, ten for males and one for disabled pupils, the other with eight male  toilets and ten female. Both have wash basins in the middle of the room.

A sign underneath the designs reads: ‘These are just to give an idea of the proposed layout for the new unisex toilets. The colours of the cubicles  and hand wash area we propose to have will be much brighter and the whole area more modern looking.’

School governor Simon Petts said the governing body has approved  the idea and is waiting for it to go to a funding committee.

He added: ‘The toilets have been in desperate need of refurbishment for a long time and we decided the best way of reducing vandalism was to make them unisex. I understand parents’ concerns but we have had someone researching child welfare and this has  not raised any red flags.’
