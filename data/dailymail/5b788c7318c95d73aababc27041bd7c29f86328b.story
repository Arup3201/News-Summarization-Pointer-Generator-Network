Lisa Martin was made redundant after exposing neglect at the Orchid View care home, which was shut down in 2011

A whistleblower who exposed a care home where five residents died says she could lose her house because no one will employ her.

Lisa Martin lifted the lid on Orchid View, which an inquest found was riddled with ‘institutional abuse’.

The 46-year-old, who worked for the Southern Cross care home chain as business administration manager, called police after witnessing a catalogue of errors being covered up or ignored by senior staff.

Her actions led to the £3,000-a-month home being shut down in 2011. As a consequence Miss Martin was made redundant from her £36,000-a-year job.

And the mother of two says her decision to go to the authorities has left her feeling ‘victimised’.

She said: ‘I have applied for well over 100 jobs in the last two years, mainly in care, and I’m still out of work. People just don’t want to know.

‘I feel like I’ve just been branded as a troublemaker and no one is willing to hire me, even though I have done nothing wrong. All I have done is told the truth.’

An inquest heard how residents at Orchid View, in Copthorne, West Sussex, were routinely given overdoses and were left soiled and in pain during two years of mismanagement and staff shortages.

The coroner ruled that abuse and neglect contributed to the deaths of Jean Halfpenny, 77, Wilfred Gardner, 85, Margaret Tucker, 77, Enid Trodden, 86, and John Holmes, 85.

Another 14 residents died of natural causes after suffering ‘sub-optimal’ care.

Mrs Halfpenny died after being given three times the correct dose of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Miss Martin, from Horley, Surrey, says she was asked to shred Mrs Halfpenny’s medical records and new ones were falsified.

She said: ‘I wasn’t completely sure what
it was I was shredding and with no medical training I felt I wasn’t in a
position to question my manager but alarm bells were starting to ring.’

Miss Martin said she became increasingly concerned about the welfare of residents after finding one elderly patient on a mattress eating his breakfast ‘out of a bowl like a dog’.

She said: ‘There were things that were worrying me, bell cords were tied up and out of reach and residents were not being fed properly.

‘I felt a sense of responsibility and I didn’t know what to do or who to tell.’ Miss Martin said the stress caused her to lose three stone in weight. She also separated from her partner of 15 years.

She now relies on her children – Luke 21, a golfer, and Lauren, 26, a chartered accountant – to help her pay the bills while her father, a retired businessman, pays the mortgage on her semi-detached home.

She said: ‘It has been a nightmare and I can see why people are reluctant to whistleblow, but I’m glad I made that call.

‘If I had left it any longer we could be looking at another 19 deaths and no one wants that.

‘I’m proud that I was able to find the courage to speak out. I shouldn’t be made to feel  like a victim.’
