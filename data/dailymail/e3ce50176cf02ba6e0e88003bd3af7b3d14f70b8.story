Returning to your car to find a pranged wing mirror is one thing... but you'd never expect to find your vehicle sitting in a large crater, courtesy of the council.

Impatient workmen created the hole in Dudley, West Midlands, when they resurfaced a road and laid tarmac around a parked car.

The abandoned black Volkswagen was left on the busy Pensnett Road - with no yellow lines in sight - when engineers arrived to put down the new surface yesterday.

After failing to locate the owner, 
the council workers stunned residents as they decided to leave a neat 
rectangular pit around it.

One resident said: 'I can't believe it when they carried on laying down the tarmac but did it around the car. It is going to look ridiculous when someone comes back and drives the car off.

'The council have enough problems with potholes but now they have gone and created a car-sized one. It is utter madness, I just can't believe anyone could be that stupid.'

Dudley Council had warned of 'considerable delays' ahead of the work, which started in March. The road provides the main route past Russells Hall hospital.

It is being carried out to resurface the badly damaged road and paint new markings - and has already caused gridlock with queues stretching back half-a-mile.

A spokesperson for Dudley Council said: 'It does appear that the workmen took the unusual decision to tarmac around the car but when it is moved, the road will be resurfaced.'

From clumsy yellow lines in Lincolnshire...

Historic cobblestones in a picturesque
market town were ruined after council workers made a clumsy 
attempt to paint double yellow lines over them.

Residents
in Stamford, Lincolnshire - dubbed 'England's most attractive town' by 
poet John Betjeman - were furious when they saw the Georgian cobbles 
daubed in thick, yellow paint last November.

The
paint ran among the stones, which were laid in the Georgian era, 
leaving an unsightly mess in St Mary's Place in the town, a popular 
tourist destination.

... to 'Disableb' in Northamptonshire

It is a mistake that even the short-sighted among us would struggle not to notice.

Painted in 2ft-high white capital letters was the word 'disableb' - mistaken for 'disabled' by council workers.

The
embarrassing blunder on a parking bay left motorists baffled last October as they 
tried to park on a residential street in Northamptonshire.
