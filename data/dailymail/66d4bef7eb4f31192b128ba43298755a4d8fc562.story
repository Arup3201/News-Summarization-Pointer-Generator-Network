Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry is tipped to win the battle of the TV chefs after her cookbook soared to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list.

It is the first time that the BBC One judge, who has written more than 70 books since 1970, has made Amazon’s top ten.

With just 11 days to go before Christmas, the 82-year-old is outselling rivals including Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and the Hairy Bikers – and seems destined to be the top-selling recipe book of the year.

Last night she told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I’m absolutely gobsmacked.

'It’s something I never believed that I would do. I’m thrilled to be joining some very special people on the bestseller list.’

Over the past decade, chef Jamie Oliver has dominated the Christmas No 1 spot

He topped the bestseller list from 2009 until 2012 but was knocked off the hot spot last year by The Hairy Bikers’ reinvention as The Hairy Dieters.

This year, Oliver has three books in the Top Ten, including his latest offering Jamie’s Comfort Food, which looks set to come in at No 2.

Mary and her co-star Paul Hollywood are also outselling other festive recipe books with Great British Bake Off: Christmas.

Xavier Garambois, vice-president of EU retail at Amazon, said: ‘Mary’s enduring and approachable style has seen her become the ultimate Christmas hostess, and chances are most of us will enjoy one of her recipes this December.’
