Cats can sometimes be a mystery, even to their owners.

But our felines friends may not be as difficult to understand as you might think, with clues to their personality hidden in their features.

This is according to a California-based cat behaviourist who has identified three different types of cat face shape that she says can accurately reveal personality.

'Cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said cat behaviourist, Arden Moore

'Cat face geometry is one of the best tools for matching a cat to a person,' says Arden Moore, author of 'Fit Cat: Tips & Tricks to Give Your Pet a Longer, Healthier, Happier Life'.

'It especially helps with "mutt" cats whose breed cannot be determined.'

While Moore's theory is not based on any scientific study, she says experience has revealed there is a strong link between looks and personality.

This may be because different breeds of cats, with distinct behaviours, often have the same face shape.

For instance, some cats, such as Main Coon, can have square faces and bodies. These cats are often keen to please their owners.

'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said  Moore.

Triangular cats have been referred to as 'the herding dogs of the cat world.' Triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy, curious, smart and vocal

Cats with round faces have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads and rounded bodies.  Arden Moore describes them as the 'lap dogs' of the feline world.'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' she said

According to a report in the New York Post, the best type of owner for these cats is one that has a a social life, works a 9-to-5 job and has a family who will play with the pet. 

Cats with round faces. meanwhile, also have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads, and rounded bodies, such as a Persian cat. 

Moore describes them as the 'lap dogs' of the feline world, and 'library cats'.

Square - 'The retrievers' 

These cats are often large with square faces and bodies. 

Maine Coon, the largest domesticated breed of cat, falls into this category. They have been described as the 'retrievers of the cat world.' 

Cats with square faces are often keen to please their owners. 'Square cats tend to be affectionate and love to snuggle and give head-butts,' said cat behaviourist, Arden Moore.

Ideal owner: Works a 9-to-5 job and has a family who will play with the pet. 

Round - 'The lapdogs'

Cats with round faces also have flatter features, large eyes, circular heads, and rounded bodies. 

An example would be the Persian cat. Arden Moore describes them as the 'lap dogs' of the feline world.

'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' she said.

Ideal owner: A homebody who enjoys spending time with the cat in a quiet environment.

Triangular - 'The herders'

Cats with triangular faces include Siamese or Abyssinian cats.

They are sleek and lanky cats, often boasting big ears and faces that narrow at the nose. 

They have been referred to as 'the herding dogs of the cat world.'  Triangular cats are thought to do best in active households and are usually busy, curious, smart and vocal. 

Ideal owner: Someone who wants to show off their pet and teach it tricks, and who doesn't own, another submissive cat. 

'They tend to be low-energy, easily frightened, submissive cats that gently display their affection to trusted family members,' Moore told Petsbest.com. 

The ideal companion would be a homebody who enjoys spending time with the cat in a quiet environment.

Most would prefer to look out of a window and watch the scenery than snuggle on your lap. 

Moore says they are the perfect cats for people who want to teach their pets tricks. 

She adds that basing a cat's face shape on their personality is remains a theory and not based on scientific studies.
