A customer who bought a Big Mac meal in Japan was shocked to discover a human tooth in the fries - in the latest food safety scandal that has led to plummeting sales in the country this year. 

Japanese officials apologized to the customer for the incident, which occurred in August last year, and said none of the employees at the branch in question had lost a tooth.

They added there were no signs the tooth had been fried - and said they are investigating how it came to be in the fries.

Senior executive Takehiko Aoki said: 'To make such cases zero is our goal. We are doing our utmost to tackle them, one by one.'

He added: 'I will eat McNuggets. I will feed McNuggets to my children. I have no doubts.'

McDonald's is extremely popular in Japan with more than 3,000 restaurants. 

But a series of recent scares, including customers finding fillings and plastic in chicken nuggets, has led to the company reporting its first annual operating loss in Japan.

Sales for January fell by a record 39%, and over the course of 2014, losses totaled 6.7billion yen - or $57 million. This is compared with an operating profit of 11.5billion yen a year earlier.

In December last year, a child was injured by a piece of plastic in an ice cream sundae in a McDonald's in Japan.

According to the fast food chain, the fragment had fallen into the dispenser while it was assembled.

In two other cases, pieces of plastic were found in Chicken McNuggets, delivered from a plant in Thailand. 

One was blue, and could have fallen in during production, but the other was clear, a type not used at McDonald's, said officials. 

Mr Aoki denied these cases highlight an overall quality-control problem and branded them 'isolated' incidents.

He acknowledged there were other cases, including a piece metal in a pancake and plastic in a McMuffin, but declined to give a tally of the total number of incidents. 

But he also added that it was possible that outsiders had planted the tooth and other items. 

Over the years, the restaurant has survived "mad cow" scares and general health worries about high calories. 

McDonald's is extremely popular in Japan, with more than 3000 outlets but customers have been driven away after a shortage of fries and series of food safety failings

Last year, orders for fries were limited to small servings because of a potato shortage. Large fries only came back recently. 

The problems are an added distraction for McDonald's Corp, the world's largest restaurant chain by sales, which last month replaced its CEO with Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook following one of its worst financial years in decades. 

McDonald's in China and Japan along with other fast food chains were hit by a scandal last year over expired meat from a Chinese supplier.

The Japan unit, 49.9% owned by McDonald's Corp, was hit after a major Chinese supplier of chicken was found to have been in breach of food safety standards.  

McDonald's Japan chief executive Sarah Casanova said the company was determined to restore its reputation.

'We serve billions of menu items every year and in the food industry we understand these kind of issues should never happen. It's our responsibility to do everything we can to obtain as close to zero as possible,' she said. 

The company has also announced plans for third-party inspections of its kitchens, fresh training for staff and sharing of information about suppliers on its website.

Shares in McDonald's Japan fell 1 percent prior to the earnings release. They have lost around 12 percent since last year's peak in June.
