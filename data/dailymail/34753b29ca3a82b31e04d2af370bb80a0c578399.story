Arsene Wenger made his first ever signing as Arsenal manager exactly 18 years ago on Monday when he brought 17-year-old striker Nicolas Anelka to the club from PSG.

The long-serving Gunners boss has been responsible for bringing in some of the greatest talent the Premier League has seen during his time in north London, as well as some flops along the way too.

Here, Sportsmail picks out the best signing from each of Wenger's 18 seasons in charge of the club.

Nicolas Anelka Arsene Wenger's first signing as Arsenal manager, 18 years ago on Monday

1996-97

Nicolas Anelka - £500,000 from PSG

Anelka was Wenger's very first signing for Arsenal and the young French striker went on to top score for the club in the 1998-99 season with 17 Premier League goals.

He earned the PFA Young Player of the Year award but fans turned on him because of a perceived poor attitude and Wenger sold Anelka to Real Madrid for £22m.

1997-98

Marc Overmars - £7million from Ajax

The pacey Dutch winger thrilled Arsenal fans with his direct style of play down the left flank and Overmars scored in the FA Cup final in his debut season.

He went on to make 100 Premier League appearances for club before moving to Spanish giants Barcelona for £25m, making him the most expensive Dutch footballer at the time. 

Marc Overmars joined the Gunners from Ajax for £7m and was sold to Barcelona three seasons later for £25m

1998-99

Freddie Ljungberg - £3million from Halmstads BK

The little-known midfielder became a transfer record for a Swedish player when Wenger brought him to Highbury and he went on to develop a reputation for scoring important goals in big games.

Ljungberg scored more than 70 goals for the Gunners and made more than 300 appearances during a nine-year spell at Arsenal winning two Premier League titles and three FA Cups.

1999-00

Thierry Henry - £11million from Juventus

Arsene Wenger's greatest ever signing, Henry joined the club from Juventus as a left winger before he was transformed into one of the Premier League's most deadliest strikers.

Henry is fifth on the all-time goalscoring list and was the star player in Arsenal's title-winning invicibles side in the 2003-04 season as he netted 30 times.

2000-01

Robert Pires - £6million from Marseille

Arsenal fought off competition from Real Madrid to secure Pires' signature from Marseille and the former France international was worth every penny of the £6m fee.

The graceful midfielder contributed goals and assists as he played a key role in the Gunners' double-winning season in 2001-02 and reproduced his scintillating form as he was selected in the PFA Team of the Year for three consecutive seasons.

2001-02

Sol Campbell - Free transfer from Tottenham

The former England international made the contentious move to switch north London allegiances after joining Arsenal from fierce rivals Tottenham on a free transfer.

Any danger of supporters not taking to the commanding defender was quickly dispelled as he helped Wenger's side claim the double during his first season at the club.

Gilberto Silva - £4.5million from Atletico Mineiro

A series of impressive displays during the 2002 World Cup with Brazil earned Gilberto a move to the Premier League champions and the midfielder fitted seamlessly into Wenger's side.

The Brazilian made 35 Premier League appearances during his debut season and formed a formidable partnership at the heart of the Arsenal side with Patrick Vieira.

2003-04

Cesc Fabregas - Free transfer from Barcelona

Pinched from Barcelona as a 16-year-old, Fabregas, one of Wenger's greatest success stories, broke into the Arsenal side as a teenager and eventually took on Vieira's No 4 shirt after the Frenchman left for Juventus.

The Spain international went on to captain the Gunners despite his young age, becoming one of the best Arsenal players post-invincible era, but he could not resist the overtures from boyhood club Barelona and sealed a £35m switch before joining Chelsea last summer.

2004-05

Mathieu Flamini - Free transfer from Marseille

Another young player plucked from relative obscurity by Wenger, Flamini endeared himself to the Arsenal fans with his no-nonsense tough-tackling approach.

But after staking his claim as a regular and an important player in Wenger's side in 2007-08, Flamini refused to sign a new contract at Arsenal and left on a free that summer to join AC Milan.

2005-06

Theo Walcott - £9million from Southampton

Walcott burst on to the scene as a 16-year-old as a product of the famed Southampton academy and convinced Wenger to sign him after making just 21 appearances in the Championship.

Walcott enjoyed his best season in 2012-13 when he netted 14 Premier League goals but has endured two years of injury hell that has prevented the pacey forward from fulfilling his early promise.

2006-07

Alex Song - £1million from Bastia

The central midfielder, currently on loan at West Ham, was another from Wenger's crop of young stars that went on to enjoy huge success in the first team.

Originally considered nothing more than a destroyer in the middle of the park, Song's technical ability and range of passing was evident in his final two seasons with the club as he struck up an accord with Robin van Persie, setting up a number of the Dutch striker's goals before he moved on to Barcelona.

Alex Song joined Arsenal for £1m and was eventually sold to Barcelona for £15m

2007-08

Bacary Sagna - £6million from Auxerre 

Another in the long list of French players Wenger successfully brought to Arsenal, Sagna became one of the Premier League's best right backs during his seven years at the club.

Equally adept at going forward as he was defending Sagna was twice named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year before leaving the club at the end of his contract to join champions Manchester City last summer.

2008-09

Andrei Arshavin - £15million from Zenit St Petersburg 

The little Russian forward was hugely influential for Arsenal during his first 18 months at the club after singing on transfer deadline day in January 2009 following a series of impressive displays at Euro 2008.

Arshavin scored all four goals for the Gunners in a 4-4 draw against Liverpool shortly after joining and scored 10 league goals the following season before a catastrophic drop in form saw him leave the club.

2009-10

Thomas Vermaelen - £10million from Ajax 

The Belgian centre back arrived from Ajax and appeared to be the solution to Arsenal's vulnerability in defence and even scored on his Premier League debut during a 6-1 win against Everton.

His commanding displays saw him elevated to club captain after Fabregas left for Barcelona but Vermaelen was dropped from the Arsenal side before he followed in the footsteps of his predecessor and joined the Catalan club last summer for £15m. 

Thomas Vermaelen appeared to be the answer to Arsenal's defensive frailties before falling out of favour

2010-11

Laurent Koscielny - £10million from Lorient 

The French defender joined the club with a lack of top-flight experience and Koscielny did little to dispel concerns that he lacked Premier League quality with a slow start to his career in north London.

But the 29-year-old has gone on to earn a reputation as one of the best centre-backs in England and is now one of the first names on Wenger's team-sheet.

2011-12

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - £12million from Southampton 

Another signing from the Southampton academy, Oxlade-Chamberlain has excited both Arsenal and England fans in equal measure but his progress has been slowed by a number of injuries.

Chamberlain earned rave reviews following an imperious display in central midfield against AC Milan in the Champions League during his first season, and at 21 he already has 20 international caps to his name.

2012-13

Santi Cazorla - £16million from Malaga 

Spain international Cazorla was signed from Malaga with the club in financial difficulty and the fee paid was considered a bargain for a player of his quality.

Cazorla scored 12 Premier League goals during his first season in England and is hitting similar heights this campaign, scoring important goals to help Arsenal into third in the table. 

Signed by Wenger in 2012, Santi Cazorla scored 12 goals in his first season at the Emirates

2013-14

Mesut Ozil - £42.5million from Real Madrid 

He was the singing that Arsenal fans had craved, the marquee that Wenger had proved so reluctant to bring to the club, and Ozil made a blistering start to his career at the Emirates.

The World Cup winner's form tailed off towards the end of his first season before injury curtailed this campaign. But Ozil has been in fine form since his recent return to the side, reminding supporters why the club smashed their transfer record to take him from Real Madrid.

2014-15

Alexis Sanchez - £35million from Barcelona

Another world class talent, the Chilean has enjoyed a brilliant first season in England and is the club's leading Premier League scorer with 12 goals.

Sanchez, who scored 19 La Liga goals for Barcelona in his final season in Spain, has an infectious enthusiasm that seems to inspire his team-mates and the 26-year-old should still have his best years ahead of him.
