Terrifying footage of the disaster, filmed by a passing motorist's dashboard camera, has emerged and shows the ATR 72-600 turboprop domestic flight, reportedly with 58 people on board, plunging into the water only three minutes after taking off from Songshan airport which was 5km away. 

Speaking earlier today Wu Jun-hong, a Taipei Fire Department official who was coordinating the rescue, said the missing people were believed to still be in the fuselage, blocked from the entrance by interior wreckage, or had been pulled downriver.

'The focus of our work is to try to use cranes to lift the front part of the wreckage, which is submerged under the water and is where most of the other passengers are feared trapped,' Wu told reporters at the scene.

'At the moment, things don't look too optimistic. Those in the front of the plane are likely to have lost their lives.'

In what was believed to be the final communication from the cockpit, aired by local television news, the plane's crew could be heard shouting 'Mayday! Mayday! Engine flameout!'.

A 'flameout' is when the flame in a plane's engine is extinguished, resulting in a loss of power or engine failure.
