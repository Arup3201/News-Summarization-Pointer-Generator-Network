The bird flu-hit farm where 6,000 ducks have been culled waited almost a week to sound the alarm - after staff first thought the animals were spooked by Bonfire Night.

Egg production dropped at the Cherry Valley breeding site in Nafferton, East Yorkshire, on November 8, but a vet only sounded a formal bird flu alert with the government on November 14, last Friday.

The firm said staff first thought the noise of fireworks might have stressed the birds into laying fewer eggs. Then a vet suspected a bacterial infection, but antibiotics didn't work.

Delay: The East Yorkshire farm where 6,000 ducks were culled yesterday (above) in a bird flu outbreak only sounded a formal alarm six days after the first problems were spotted, operator Cherry Valley has confirmed

Hosed down: Ducks are disinfected at the farm today. Three days before the first signs of the virus, a shipment of 15,000 eggs left the farm. They are now being tested for the virus in incubators 50 miles away

Only three days before the first problem was seen, a shipment of 15,000 eggs left the farm. They are now being tested for the virus in incubators 50 miles away amid fears they may have to be destroyed.

A drop in egg numbers is one of the six key warning signs for spotting bird flu listed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

But Cherry Valley, which breeds 7million ducks a year for ready meals sold in Tesco, M&S, Lidl and Aldi at 33 sites across Britain, said many factors could have been responsible

A Cherry Valley spokesman told MailOnline: ‘On November 8-9 the farm first noticed problems and notified a consultant [private] vet, who was in touch with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).

‘There was no suspicion of bird flu originally, party because it was around bonfire weekend and there were fireworks.

A Cherry Valley spokesman defended the delay, telling MailOnline: 'It could have been one of many things rather than jumping to the very worst conclusion straight away, like a person feeling ill and going to the GP'

'These are one of the external factors which cause stress in animals and egg production to drop.

‘So it could have been one of many things rather than jumping to the very worst conclusion straight away, much like a person feeling ill and going to the GP.’

The private vet first contacted the APHA on November 11, but both parties agreed it was probably a bacterial infection and prescribed the ducks with antibiotics the same day.

When ducks continued to die and the antibiotics didn’t work, the vet reported a suspected bird flu case on November 14, the spokesman added. 

Tests then confirmed the disease the next day and a public warning went out a day after that. 

In a statement, the firm added: 'There are well-established robust processes in place and they were closely followed.

'There was no suspicion of bird flu initially as a fall in egg production can be a symptom of several different things. These include general stresses, such as disturbance due to such things as fireworks which were a feature of that weekend.' 

Defra confirmed yesterday the virus was the same H5N8 strain found in Germany and the Netherlands.

A leading health expert claimed there will 'probably be human cases' of the strain - despite it never infecting a human before. 

Elizabeth Mumford from the World Health Organisation warned the virus was 'unpredictable' as all 6,000 white Pekin ducks on the farm were gassed to death and dumped in metal containers.

Red signs were placed around the small East Yorkshire village as environment secretary Liz Truss told MPs: 'Whilst we're never complacent about such an important issue, we do have a very strong track record'

Egg laying begins dropping at Nafferton farm. At first staff suspect ducks have been 'spooked' by loud noises on Bonfire weekend.

Tuesday, November 11

Vet contacts Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA); both agree it is probably a bacterial infection and prescribe antibiotics.

Friday, November 14

With deaths continuing, vet sounds first bird flu alarm with APHA. Tests taken the same day.

Saturday, November 15

Tests confirm the virus is bird flu of type H5. Later tests rule out lethal H5N1 strain.

Sunday, November 16

Public alert declared late at night after emergency meeting involving the chief vet.

Tuesday, November 18

6,000 ducks culled as Defra confirms virus is same H5N8 strain found in Germany and the Netherlands. 

She said there could be 'a few sporadic cases', adding: 'We believe any time that humans are in close contact with poultry, there's a possibility of transmission to humans'.

Although the possibility of seeing human cases was low, she said: 'I don't see why we wouldn't. If it's really circulating widely, there's no reason we shouldn't see human cases.' 

It was the first time an expert had claimed the H5N8 strain could pass to humans. Other top scientists, including Britain's chief vet and Public Health England, have stressed repeatedly that the risk of transfer to humans is negligible.

Yesterday a second site owned by Cherry Valley was drawn into bird flu fears for the first time. 

The firm's Usselby hatchery near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, incubating between 14,000 and 15,000 duck eggs which left the stricken farm on November 5 and are due to hatch in two weeks.    

Defra is now set to test the eggs and work out whether they need to be destroyed.

A spokesman said: 'As part of our robust action in response to the confirmed case of avian flu, we are considering a range of measures including destroying a shipment of eggs sent to a separate farm for hatching earlier in November.

'This is in line with our tried and tested procedures for dealing with avian flu outbreaks.'

Cherry Valley admitted the move but insisted: 'As the World Health Organisation, the Minister, the Food Standards Agency, Public Health England and others have made clear, there is absolutely no risk to humans and people should continue to eat all forms of poultry.

'Any eggs that are destroyed are done so to protect the integrity of the supply chain and ensure that the disease does not affect more birds.' 

Dr Colin Butter, head of avian viral immunology at The Pirbright Institute for animal health, said: 'It's certainly possible that eggs from an infected flock could carry influenza on their surface.' 

Final moments: Ducks are packed into crates and taken to be culled today at a bird flu-hit Yorkshire farm

Operation: The farm is run by Lincolnshire firm Cherry Valley, whose products from the 7million ducks it breeds in Britain every year include frozen duck meals for supermarket shelves such as the one above

He added: 'In chickens you would know very fast because they die. With highly pathogenic bird flu, which this is, the can die within a couple of days, so you know very fast that you have a problem in the flock.

'However, with some water fowl such as ducks, the symptoms of influenza can be much less severe, so farmers have to be on a very sharp lookout.'

But he added: 'There's all evidence to suggest this farm picked it up extremely quickly... [And] I'm quite sure the scientists from Defra have this question in hand.' 

A Defra spokesman said: 'The advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Public Health England remains that the risk to public health is very low. The Food Standards Agency have said there is no food safety risk for consumers.'
