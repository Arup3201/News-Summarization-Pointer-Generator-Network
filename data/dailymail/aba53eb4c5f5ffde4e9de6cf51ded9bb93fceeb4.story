Sentenced: Martyn Jones, 40, who had 17 previous convictions, was jailed for three years over the crash

A hit-and-run driver who left a pedestrian in a coma after mowing him down while being chased by police had been speeding because he was desperate for the toilet, a court heard yesterday.

Martyn Jones, 40, whose four-year-old son was with him in the car, was jailed for three years after admitting leaving Tekie Yamani, 37, with brain injuries, fractured ribs and memory loss.

At the time of the 60mph crash in the Deane area of Bolton, Greater Manchester, witnesses said the pedestrian was thrown into the air and landed up to 50ft further along the road.

Jones - who had 17 previous convictions - had soiled himself and was being chased by two officers in a police van. They had noticed his erratic driving as he left a nearby McDonald’s restaurant.

Katy Appleton, defending, told Bolton Crown Court that Jones suffered from difficulties with his bowel movements and wore a colostomy bag.

She said: ‘He had visited his daughter and was in a distressed state. He was desperate to go to the toilet and soiled himself, which led to the very unfortunate events.’

His victim Mr Yamani, a taxi driver and father-of-three originally from Eritrea, was walking to a shop on Wigan Road to buy a phone card when he was struck by the car, on July 18 at about 12pm.

Jones claimed to police he was unaware that he had hit a person, instead thinking someone had hit his car with a metal bar in an attempted carjacking.

But he drove his blue Vauxhall Astra to a friend’s house in nearby Leigh and asked him to keep the vehicle, with the damaged windscreen covered up.

The court heard that Jones’s speed was about twice the legal limit and he was seen weaving in and out of traffic and overtaking vehicles.

John Hatton, who was driving a bus which Jones overtook, said it was ‘the worst driving’ he had ever seen in his career.

Mr Yamani suffered a serious brain injury and post-traumatic amnesia, the court heard. He was in a coma for the three weeks after the accident.

CCTV footage which captured the horrifying moment Mr Yamani was struck was played to the court.

Jones, who lives in a £60,000 terraced house in Leigh, pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop.

Recorder Stuart Driver said: ‘This was a prolonged and deliberate case of serious bad driving.

‘Your victim was a pedestrian and a vulnerable road user. You did all this while you had your vulnerable four-year-old son in the car with you.’
