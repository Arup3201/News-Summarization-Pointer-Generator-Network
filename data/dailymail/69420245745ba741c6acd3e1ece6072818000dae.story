Angel di Maria will become the latest player to wear the iconic Manchester United No 7 shirt when he lines up for his debut at Burnley's Turf Moor on Saturday lunchtime.

We are all aware of the legends who have worn this number down the years - George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. 

But what about those who wore the shirt but didn't live so long in the memory? Who took on the legend but weren't able to live up to expectations? MailOnline Sport takes a look back.

Magnificent Seven: Angel di Maria is the latest to wear the iconic Manchester United shirt number

Steve Coppell (United 1975-1983)

It would certainly be unfair to say winger Coppell was a flop as a United No 7 but he perhaps didn't achieve the glory he deserved.

Part of Tommy Docherty's promising team in the late seventies, he suffered FA Cup final heartache in 1976 when United were beaten by second division Southampton at Wembley.

Coppell made amends 12 months later, ending Liverpool's Treble ambitions in a 2-1 win and in all he made 322 league appearances, scoring 53 times.

Hindered by knee problems, Coppell was forced to retire in October 1983, at the age of just 28, before forging a long managerial career.

Underachiever? Steve Coppell was good at United but perhaps could have been more

Ashley Grimes (United 1977-1983)

Dublin-born utility player Grimes played in 107 matches for United during his half a dozen years at Old Trafford yet was never able to hold down a first-team place.

He wasn't especially favoured by manager Dave Sexton and even less so by his successor Ron Atkinson, who brought in the likes of Bryan Robson.

Grimes played for United during a relatively barren spell in their history for silverware but he did collect an FA Cup winners' medal in 1983 as an unused substitute in the final with Brighton.

He was moved on to Coventry the same year and later played for Luton Town and Osasuna. He won 18 caps for the Republic of Ireland.

Ralph Milne (United 1988-1991)

Squad numbers officially came along with the inception of the Premiership in 1992, but Milne wore the No 7 shirt during his three years at Old Trafford in the early Alex Ferguson years.

United had finished second in the First Division the season before midfielder Milne arrived and Ferguson believed the former Dundee United man would help them win the title.

It didn't quite transpire that way, with Milne scoring just three goals in 30 appearances for the club. He was certainly not loved by the fans and regularly crops up in debates about their worst-ever players.

Ferguson admitted many years later that Milne was his worst signing, saying: 'I only paid £170,000 but still get condemned for it.'

Given this, it's remarkable Milne clung on to the club's payroll until the summer of 1991 before being released.

Keith Gillespie (United 1993-1995)

A member of the Class of '92 alongside Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville et al, Northern Irishman Gillespie was a player with real pace and promise.

But he was unable to force his way past Russian Andrei Kanchelskis in an era of success for United and he only made a handful of first-team appearances.

In the end, Gillespie moved on to Newcastle, part of the deal that brought striker Andy Cole to Old Trafford.

He later went on to play for Blackburn, Leicester and Sheffield United among others and won 86 caps for his country.

Michael Owen (United 2009-2012)

It's fair to say that Ferguson's offer to join United came as a big surprise to Owen, who was considered well past his best and prone to injuries.

Handed the No 7 shirt, Owen spent three years at United, making 52 appearances and scoring 17 times.

He found it hard to dislodge the likes of Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov from the forward line and any progress seemed to be checked by yet another injury setback.

Highlights included a last-minute winner against Manchester City and a Champions League hat-trick away to Wolfsburg.

Antonio Valencia (United 2009-present)

After Owen's departure, the No 7 shirt was passed on the Valencia, who was entering his fourth season with the club.

The change in number led to an inconsistent season with the Ecuador winger finding the net only once in 40 games, a decrease from his previous seasons.

He duly switched back to his more familiar No 25 shirt the following year though it's debatable whether his form has actually improved for the change.
