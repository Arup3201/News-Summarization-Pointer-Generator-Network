Hurricane Katia, a Category 2 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, is expected to pass between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States over the next day or two, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a report late Tuesday.

At 11:00pm EDT, Katia was located about 325 miles south-southwest of Bermuda and was packing maximum winds of 105 miles per hour, the NHC said.

'Katia is moving toward the northwest near 9mph and this general motion is expected to continue through Wednesday, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest and north Wednesday night and Thursday,' the NHC said.

Incoming: Hurricane Katia is currently around 450 miles from Bermuda with gusts of 160 mph, but could sweep inland

Upgraded: The storm, which could come inland next week, has now become a category 4 hurricane, the second-highest level of intensity

A tropical storm watch is in effect for Bermuda, the NHC said.

The core of Katia is expected to move between the east coast of the 
United States and Bermuda on Wednesday and Thursday, the NHC added.

Although
experts believe Katia may veer away from the East Coast later this 
week, large swells from the hurricane could still cause life-threatening
coastal surf and rip currents.

Katia has already left impact along the Central Florida coastline, as lifeguards on Labor Day warned beachgoers of dangerous rip currents and jellyfish, reports ClickOrlando.com.

Beach patrol officers said jellyfish stung nearly 300 swimmers on Monday. Meanwhile, waves in Daytona Beach have doubled in size since Sunday and dangerous rip currents prompted about 20 rescues throughout Volusia County.

The storm has weakened since Monday from a Category 4 storm as it continued its route across the Atlantic.

Still, insurers are also bracing 
themselves incase Katia does increase in strength and come inland, just 
days after the extensive flooding of Hurricane Irene and torrential rain
of Tropical Storm Lee.

Global insurers and reinsurers have already suffered catastrophe losses of more than $70billion this year, by industry estimates, including up to $6billion in the United States from Irene.

NHC hurricane specialist Robbie Berg told Reuters the greatest threat from Katia for the U.S. eastern seaboard was likely to be the large swells and resulting dangerous coastal surf and currents the storm generated on its path.

Mr Berg said: 'Even though these storms 
may stay offshore, they still can be a deadly threat, especially to 
people going to the beach.

'It may be a beautiful nice day out and you may just not know that there are rip currents there that can pull you out to sea.'

There is still thought to be around a one in ten chance that parts of the East Coast could experience tropical storm-force winds when Katia passed well offshore later this week.

Jutting coastal areas like North Carolina's Outer Banks and Cape Codd in Massachusetts could be particularly at risk.

Katia, the second hurricane of the June-through-November Atlantic season, has kept forecasters guessing for days about its potential threat to the United States.
