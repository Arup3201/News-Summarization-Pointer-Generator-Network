Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger knows all too well what is on the line when his side face Besiktas for a place in the group stages of the Champions League.

The Gunners head to Istanbul for the first leg of their play-off tie looking to maintain their record of reaching Europe's elite club competition for each of the last 16 campaigns.

It is, of course, not all just about prestige, with each Champions League home match estimated to bring in around £3million of additional revenue not to mention lucrative prize money which kicks off at some 8.6 million euro (£7million) for successful qualification.

Not like last time: At this stage last year Arsenal eased past Fenerbahce but Wenger knows it won't be easy

Confidence: Wenger hopes that the Gunners can build momentum from their Community Shield win

Arsenal breezed through what was last season a potentially tricky tie against Fenerbahce, coming away from Istanbul with a 3-0 victory before winning 2-0 back at the Emirates Stadium.

Wenger, though, is taking nothing for granted against Slaven Bilic's well-organised outfit, who defeated Feyenoord 5-2 on aggregate in the third-round with former Chelsea striker Demba Ba netting a hat-trick in the second leg.

'I believe it will be a very tough game and a very important one for us. We want to be in the Champions League group stage,' said Wenger.

'Besiktas had a convincing result against Feyenoord, and so for us we have the luck to play the first game away.

Tough task: Wenger is pleased to be playing the second leg at home against a strong Besiktas side

New signing: Chile star Alexis Sanchez has arrived at the Emirates Stadium keen to make a big impact

Absent: Neither Podolski or Ozil are likely to be fit for the trip to Turkey after their World Cup exploits

'We know what is at stake of course and want to be highly focused for this game.'

Besiktas' Vodafone Arena ground is being redeveloped, so Tuesday night's match will take place at the 72,000-seater Ataturk Olympic Stadium, where Liverpool famously beat AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League.

German-born Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil is of Turkish descent, but unlikely to get the chance to play in the first leg as he has only just returned from an extended break following the World Cup.

Arsenal added Chile forward Alexis Sanchez, France international defender Mathieu Debuchy, promising young centre-back Calum Chambers and Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina to the squad over the summer.

Impressive: Kieran Gibbs starred in the Community Shield win against Manchester City

Full-back Kieran Gibbs is confident the Gunners have the strength in depth to make an impact on all fronts this season.

'More players have arrived than departed and so the squad looks deeper than in previous seasons,' he wrote in a blog on sportlobster.com.

'There is now more competition for places, which is important for the team throughout the year.

'Hopefully, everyone can stay fit and well, because it should raise the performance of each individual player.'
