Andy Murray revealed he was enjoying a Sunday afternoon on the sofa playing Mario Kart when he got the call to replace the injured Roger Federer for an impromptu ATP World Tour exhibition match.

A mammoth final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic was cancelled after the Swiss star claimed he wasn't 'match fit' to take part following a grueling semi-final clash against Stan Wawrinka on Saturday night.

To the delight of the London crowd, Murray dutifully agreed to take part in a one-set exhibition match against the Djokovic, but was unable to overcome the Serb, going down 5-8.

Speaking after the match, Murray told the crowd: 'I was playing Mario Kart on the sofa when I got the call. I was winning at that. My Mario Kart is better than my tennis.' 

The likes of Jose Mourinho, Hugh Grant and Will Young were in attendance as Djokovic and Murray looked to pick the crowd up following the disappointment of Federer's premature exit.

Djokovic came onto court ahead of playing Murray to receive the trophy, which was understandably a low-key occasion.

Addressing the crowd, he said: 'Clearly this is not the way I wanted things to happen. I'm really sorry for Roger not being able to come to the court.

'I've known him for a long time and I would say he and Rafa (Nadal) are the biggest competitors, guys who always give 100 per cent, so I'm sure, if he could have come out and played, he would have done.

'I wish him all the best to recover. He has an important week ahead of him.'

The pair took the first to eight set as seriously as you'd expect, but for several flashes of humour including Djokovic jokingly lobbing the ball in the direction of Sunday night's umpire following a controversial decision.

It may have ended up as nothing but a bit of fun for the crowd, but Djokovic showed enough to convince even Federer's greatest admirer that the trophy would have fallen into the Serbian's hands.

Federer now faces a battle to be fit for the Davis Cup final against France which starts in Lille on Friday.

Along with the Olympic singles title, the Davis Cup is the major honour which still eludes the 17-times grand slam champion, with Switzerland's hopes resting on the shoulders of him and Wawrinka.

'The way I feel right now there's no way I can compete at any level really,' Federer said. 'Probably in a few days it's going to be better.'
