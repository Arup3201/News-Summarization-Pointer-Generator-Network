Police are investigating claims that Leonard Rossiter, pictured, was in a gang of sex attackers

Police are investigating claims that Leonard Rossiter was in a gang of sex attackers working on a notorious BBC drama.

Operation Yewtree officers – whose inquiries were sparked by the Jimmy Savile revelations – have been told the actor, was involved in abuse on the set of the 1968 drama, The Year of the Sex Olympics.

Rossiter, who starred in Rising Damp and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, died in 1984. Police are said to be preparing to question up to ten former BBC staff over alleged assaults on a man and a woman.

The Year of the Sex Olympics told of a future dominated by reality shows and pornography. The male complainant, a 66-year-old actor, was 18 and an extra at the time of filming at London Television Centre.

Rossiter played a TV producer, part of the global elite, who stranded a family on an island and delightedly kept the cameras rolling as their lives fell apart. He also co-ordinated judges giving points to couples having sex,

The drama broadcast was controversial in itself. But it is only in recent months that it has been claimed sex crimes were being committed behind the scenes during four days of filming.

According to the first complainant, an actor now aged 66 who was 18 and an extra at the time of filming, he found the BBC set at London Television Centre to be a ‘cesspit of depravity’.

He claimed he was assaulted twice by three men – with the second attack involving Rossiter as an excited spectator.

The man said: ‘In the rehearsal room, one BBC man tightly held my wrists while two others were behind me trying to rape me. I was the victim of two assaults.

‘The second time they obviously tipped off Leonard Rossiter because while I was struggling and shouting for help he was in the room.

‘He obviously found it all a big turn-on. He was watching with glee. The staff who attacked me were animals and thought they could get away with anything.’

The former extra said that he, like the female victim, had been instructed to remove his clothes so he could be covered in gold paint for the BBC2 play.

And he said he found the woman was a victim too shortly after the attacks on him, when he found her distressed at the west London studios.

The man said: ‘She looked really upset and I asked her what was wrong. She said: “It’s like a f****** orgy in there - I didn’t come here to get f*****”.

One of the complainants claimed the abuse occurred on the set of a drama, which was filmed at BBC Television Centre, pictured, in 1968

‘She had clearly witnessed something bad. She said she was going to do something about it. She did not go into details about what had happened to her.

‘She was crying and had obviously been very disturbed by what had happened.

‘I told her she wasn’t alone and that I had been attacked by Rossiter and his colleagues too.’

He said the pair then reported the attacks, continuing: ‘She was even more distressed than I was and we went to see someone senior at the Beeb to tell him what had happened.

‘I remember them saying, “If you pursue this you will never work for the BBC again.”

‘It was disgusting but we were both young and feared for our careers. The woman was too distressed to continue that day, so filming was cut short.

‘It was disgusting but we were both young and feared for our careers. The woman was too distressed to continue that day, so filming was cut short.’

The man went on: ‘It is important people know what a cesspit of depravity it was at the BBC. Staff at the Television Centre assumed they could get away with anything. It’s time these people face justice.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said it was not the force’s policy to give a running commentary on enquiries.

And a spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Any allegations of criminality are a matter for the police, and the BBC is not able to comment.’
