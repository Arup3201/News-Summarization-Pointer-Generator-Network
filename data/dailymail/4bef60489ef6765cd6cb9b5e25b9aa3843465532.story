The recovery of eight classic sportscars swallowed by a huge sinkhole in Kentucky began Monday at the National Corvette Museum.

The
 first car, a relatively undamaged 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil that landed into 
the 30-foot hole on its wheels, was pulled out of the giant hole by a 
crane at the Bowling Green museum as bystanders broke into cheers.

Amazingly,
 the car started and drove around 20 feet to the entrance of the museum 
after its wheels reached solid ground once again.

Rescued! Workers use a crane to recover the first Chevrolet Corvette, the 2009 Corvette ZR-1 "Blue Devil," from the sinkhole at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky on Monday

Sinking feeling: The Blue Devil was the first of eight collectible Corvettes that crashed into the earth beneath the Corvette Museum early February 11

Right again: Workers set the 2009 Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1 "Blue Devil" on the ground. The area of Kentucky where the 30-foot deep hole opened up is home to many sinkholes and cave systems including Mammoth Cave

'That's a GM product for you. They take a licking and keep on ticking!' project manager Mike Murphy said in a release.

Workers hoped to recover a second 'vette on Monday--a 1993 Ruby Red 40th Anniversary Corvette.

All told, the cars are believed to be worth around $2 million.

About
 100 people watched the recovery work, which proceeded following 
warnings that efforts to pull out the cars could take weeks to get off, 
or inside, the ground.

Museum
 spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli says workers hope to recover a third car 
Tuesday. Others won't be pulled out until workers further stabilize the 
sinkhole. That could take three weeks.

Chevrolet will oversee restoration of the cars at a Michigan plant.

For now, folks around the museum are just happy the effort is underway.

'It's been a huge relief. It went better than expected,' Murphy said.Â 

Still running: The dusty Blue Devil appeared to be the least damaged of the eight that fell into the earth and even drove several feet to the entrance of the museum after it was recovered

More to come: The entire recovery effort was expected to take about a week

It was around three weeks before on February 11 when things came crashing down inside the museum.

A gaping hole 40 feet wide opened up beneath the showroom, but since it was around 5:45am, no injuries occurred.

However, some of the cars weren't as lucky.

One black 1962 Corvette was discovered with a 5-ton block of concrete on its hood.

Expensive: Classic cars valued at more than $1.6 million have been swallowed up by a 30 feet sinkhole. It happened at 5:45am on February 11

A
 1993 Spyder, the one millionth Corvette from 1992, a 2001 Mallett 
Hammer Z06 Corvette, and the 1.5 Millionth Corvette from 2009 are also 
all still slated to be pulled out of the wreckage, according to the New 
York Daily News.

The museum plans to put the cars, damage and all, into a special display through August 3 once they're all recovered.

From there, Chevrolet is expected to take over the restoration in Warren, Michigan, which will take many months.

The museum is taking donations to use toward restoring its wrecked display.

Mind the gap: The cars were consumed when the earth opened up early Wednesday beneath a display area when the museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky was closed. No injuries were reported
