South Africa's Trevor Fisher Jnr maintained the 100 per cent record of home players in the Africa Open by winning his first European Tour title with a brilliant display in East London.

Fisher Jnr played his last 36 holes in 17 under par, adding a closing 64 to his third round of 63 to finish 24 under par, five shots ahead of England's Matt Ford.

South African players have won the Africa Open every year since its inception in 2010, when Fisher Jnr was joint fourth behind former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel. Fellow major winner Louis Oosthuizen won the title in 2011 and 2012, with Darren Fichardt and Thomas Aiken also triumphing on home soil.

'It's amazing,' said Fisher Jnr, who had won eight times on the Sunshine Tour. 'I can't believe it. It's been a long time coming. I've been a pro for a long time.

'I played well. It's always a bit nervewracking leading, you always try not to think about the result but I think I did a good job today of staying in the moment. I was nervous the last few holes but I think that's natural. It was a great day, I played well, everything worked out well and the putter was amazing.

'I think it's written in the stars; if you can get out of your own way you can achieve a lot of things. Everyone has to keep trying and keep working.'

Fisher Jnr took a two-shot lead into the final round and birdied four of his first seven holes, but a bogey on the fifth meant that four birdies in the same stretch from Ford ensured the gap was cut in half.

The decisive moment came on the ninth as Fisher Jnr made birdie and Ford missed a short putt for par, and the world number 271 secured victory in style with four birdies on the back nine - including one from 35 feet on the 18th.

'I made birdie on 16 and knew I had a five-shot lead and it would have been very naughty of me to lose that lead,' Fisher Jnr added at the presentation ceremony.

'Matt's a little British bulldog. He just sank putts and I thought 'Jeez I'm not going to get away from this guy'. He made birdie, I made birdie so it was quite tough and then on nine I made a great birdie and he made a five and that was where it turned around for me and I knew I just had to keep my head up and keep going.

'It's really been tough, I've gone to many tour schools and it's such a tough week. If you don't play well that week you don't get your card. It's amazing - everything worked out well this week, the putts fell and I'm very grateful.'
