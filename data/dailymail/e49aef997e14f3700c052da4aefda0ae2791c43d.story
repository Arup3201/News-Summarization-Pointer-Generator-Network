Rio Ferdinand has promised his form and that of Queens Park Rangers will improve.

Rangers are bottom of the Barclays Premier League ahead of their eighth game of the season this weekend, against Liverpool on Sunday.

Ferdinand has played in all seven games thus far, but Harry Redknapp's men have been struggling.

 The 35-year-old former Manchester United defender told the London Evening Standard: 'It's early in the season and things will turn around - I'm confident of that.

'We haven't gelled as a squad so when we do, I'd like to think results will improve. Although it's not as easy as that - it's no good just talking about it, we have to go out and do it.'

Ferdinand, who has until next Tuesday to answer a Football Association misconduct charge for a comment made on Twitter, recognises he has struggled to adjust to life fighting at the foot of the table.

He added: 'I'd like to think I can play more good games than bad. If anyone thinks I'm here not to muck in and fight with the rest of the lads - it couldn't be further from the truth.

'Yes, it's been difficult. I've had to readjust. The way of thinking and of playing is different to what I was used to at United.

'I'm 35 but still feel like I have a lot to offer - that's why I made the move. I'm very pleased that QPR gave me a chance and more than likely, this is where I will end my career.'
