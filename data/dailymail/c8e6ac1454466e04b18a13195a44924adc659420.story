Zoila Leiva was four-and-a-half months pregnant and looking forward to having twins when she received some terrible news - she had breast cancer.

But the 42-year-old from Whittier in California, refused to have an abortion and was able to battle back to health and keep her precious sons despite undergoing chemotherapy.

She spoke to Mail Online on the day doctors reported in The Lancet that pregnant women with breast cancer can be treated safely and don't need to delay treatment until they give birth.

Rocky road: Zoila had four rounds of chemotherapy during her pregnancy after refusing to abort her twins

The team from Belgium's Leuven Cancer Institute found chemotherapy can be 
safely given in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy without affecting the unborn baby and, in 
general, surgery is safe during any of the three trimesters.

The advice given to Ms Leiva, who was diagnosed back in 2007 was very different. She had first felt a lump in her breast in February of that year but had been told it was a benign cyst following a mammogram and ultrasound.

However, in December she was told it was actually cancer and she faced a terrible decision of life and death.

She told Mail Online: 'My oncologist recommended an abortion straight away as my cancer was advanced and had spread to the lymph nodes.

'They told me there was no way of knowing if it had spread into any organs while I was pregnant as I couldn't have any of the necessary scans.

'They wanted me to have a termination within two weeks but after hearing about the procedure I was horrified. I could feel my babies moving. I thought "I'll just die of depression if I kill them now."

'So I never went back to that medical practice.'

Aided by the cancer support network Hope For Two, Ms Leiva went to see a series of experts including obstetrician Dr Elyce Cardonick who told her that she could have cancer treatment while pregnant - especially as she was past her first trimester.

She began a course of chemotherapy at the Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. But she was still able to enjoy her teenager daughter's Cinderella-themed birthday celebration with a full head of hair.

'The stylist pulled off a miracle as it all fell out the next day,' she said.

She had four rounds of chemotherapy over 12 weeks, while also taking the drug Herceptin. By the time she was ready to give birth at  the recommended 32 weeks the tumour had shrunk to almost nothing.

Ms Leiva said she had three specialist doctors on hand during her C-section as they were worried her sons would weigh as little as 2lbs. However, however when they were born in April 2008 Julian was 4lbs 3oz while Joel was 3lbs 12oz.

'They were strong healthy boys,' Ms Leiva, who is a manager at a brake systems company, said.

'The doctors had told me they could be in intensive care for five weeks but they were ready to come home in two weeks!'

Zoila Leiva: 'Cancer doesn't have to be a death sentence'

Now Ms Leiva's treatment could continue in earnest. She had a further 10 rounds of chemotherapy using a more toxic combination of drugs. Thankfully the disease had not spread to any of her vital organs. When her sons were six-months-old she had a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction.

When her chemotherapy finished in January 2009, Mrs Leiva was ecstatic to be told she was in remission. However, she still had to undergo two months radiotherapy treatment and continued to take Herceptin until November 2010.

Ms Leiva has now been clear of the disease for three years and says she is enjoying every day she gets to spend with her sons.

'They are four years old now and little terrors!' she joked.

'They are full of energy and they are excited about starting (a junior form of baseball) Tee Ball this Saturday.'

My miracles: Zoila was relieved to find the cancer hadn't spread to her organs while she was carrying her babies

In the UK, 5,000 women of reproductive age are affected by breast cancer every year. Of
 all cases diagnosed in women aged 30 or under, 10 to 20 per cent take 
place during pregnancy or in the first year after a birth.

Breast cancer in pregnant women is 
generally diagnosed later than usual because symptoms 
are obscured by expected changes to the body such as an increase in 
cup-size.

Frederic Amant a doctor from  Belgium's Leuven Cancer Institute who worked on The Lancet report, said: 'The new 
insights we gained during our research facilitate cancer treatment and 
provide hope for mother and child in most cases.

'Most mothers feel stronger and are even
 more motivated to undergo the cancer treatment and its side effects, 
since she is fighting for her child as well.'

But Dr Amant admitted that breast cancer in pregnancy 'remains challenging' because in some situations advanced cancer can 
lead to death of mother and baby.

The report said women and their partners
 should be informed about the treatment available, and 
that termination of pregnancy did not seem to improve maternal outcome. But it said 'the decision to continue or end the pregnancy is a personal one'.

Ms Leiva said she was keen to tell these women that they did have options.

'I want women to know that there is hope and that they can save their lives and that of the babies as well,' she said.

'Cancer doesn’t have to be a death sentence.'
