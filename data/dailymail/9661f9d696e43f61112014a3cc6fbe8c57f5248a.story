An enterprising mother has ensured her children and their classmates can enjoy a nutritious hot school lunch after their canteen closed by becoming the new school cook.

Children at St Andrew's Primary School in Buckland Monachorum, near Yelverton, Devon, had been reluctant to eat the hot meals on offer and the canteen kitchen was eventually closed.

For 18 months all 202 pupils at the school had to make do with packed lunches everyday - and like many parents Susie Zaleski, 41, found it hard to come up with healthy lunchboxes

She felt her children Aiya, eight, and Lola, six, would benefit from a decent hot meal during their school day.

She set up a catering firm, won the contract at St Andrew's and now spends her days in the school's kitchen making everything from pizzas to Spanish chicken stew and chocolate brownies.

Now, nearly every pupil in the school sits down at lunchtime to enjoy a delicious, locally sourced, child-friendly meal - compared to just 30 pupils a day in previous years.

The Government's free school meals policy, which means every child aged five to seven is entitled to a hot lunch, has put pressure on catering staff across the country to come up with healthy, balanced menus to keep young diners and their parents happy.

Susie has enlisted the help of other parents at the school to help her serve lunch and come up with simply, good-quality meal ideas for the children

Ms Zaleski, who has enlisted the help of other parents at the school to help her serve lunch, says she wants to show that it is not rocket science - children just want simple, good quality food.

 'We've got kids at the school and we all know what they like,' she said. 'We run the menus past our own kids and they'll say 'yay' or 'no', depending on what we suggest.

'We cook everything from scratch. The spaghetti bolognaise is a recipe my mum used and we also follow recipes we've found online from Nigella Lawson or Mary Berry.

'We've had such amazing feedback from the children and parents. 

'One little girl didn't eat anything for the first couple of days, but gradually she's started to try more and more. Her mum saw me in the street and said 'thank you so much'.'

Ms Zalesk, who used to work as a waitress at the River Cafe restaurant in London before taking on various desk jobs, said moments like that have made her new role hugely satisfying.

She said: 'I don't want to sound trite but it's so nice to feel as though you're putting something back into the community.

'We knew we wanted our children to have hot meals but we didn't want any old catering firm coming in and doing it.

'I just thought - let's go for it and do it ourselves'

Living in Buckland Monachorum, she says says many parents are willing to pay the £2.30 it costs for each meal because they trust her as a fellow villager and playground mum.

Now, in the 12 months her catering firm Zest has been up and running, she has had the chance to learn all the children's names and their dietry requirements, plus if they like a bit of extra gravy now and then.

Tom Wilkinson and classmate Kashi Sen, both seven, said their school dinners were a real hit.

'They're amazing - we all really love them,' said Tom.

'They're so good,' said Kashi, 'About the same as my mum makes at home.'

Headteacher Julie Tailyour, like many of her staff, regularly joins the children for lunch to take advantage of the local ingredients and home-cooked style.

'The meals here are absolutely lovely, we are delighted with the quality,' she said. 

MONDAY: Homemade chicken goujons or vegetable, tomato and mozarella pasta bake. Blueberry muffins.

TUESDAY: Homemade lamb koftas or Quorn stew with herby dumplings. Stewed apple with blackberry and vanilla ice-cream.

WEDNESDAY: Roast chicken or cheese and lentil roast. Oaty biscuits.

THURSDAY: Homemade pizza. Fruit and natural yogurt.

FRIDAY: Oven baked fish fingers or Quorn sausages. Pear and chocolate sponge and custard.

'It has made such a difference to the children.

'They are happier, more well behaved and settled. 

'Before, when everyone had packed lunch, the atmosphere was rather like a picnic - it just wasn't right.

'Now the children look forward to their meal, they talk about their meal - they just love their dinners!'

Mother Suzy Connor said that was certainly true for her children Holly, seven and Daisy, four.

'My two love their lunches,' she said.

'I am also happier, knowing they get a hot and healthy meal for lunch.

'They seem to have more energy now at the end of the day.

'I helped out one day for lunch and took some left over pizza back for our supper. It was better than any pizza that we had had at home before.'
