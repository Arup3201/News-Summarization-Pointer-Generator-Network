Shocking footage emerged this evening of one of the suspected Woolwich attackers, covered in blood and saying: 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.'

The footage, obtained by ITV News, shows the moments after the brutal attack.

It shows the suspect, wearing a dark jacket, jeans and a beanie hat, calmly walking towards the camera with what appears to be a machete and a large knife, clasped by the handles in his bloodied left hand.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Gesticulating with both hands the man points to his own face as he says: 'We must fight them as they fight us. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth'

The man appears to be carrying a knife and a machete in his blood-covered hands

He speaks to onlookers at the scene and apologises to the women who 'have had to witness this today'

Gesticulating with both hands - while gripping the weapons - the man points to his own face as he says: 'We must fight them as they fight us. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.'

Over his shoulder, a group of onlookers can be seen just a few steps from the victim.

Traffic, including an articulated lorry, has stopped on the carriageway, metres from the figure lying in the road.

The suspect, speaking clear English with a London accent, says: 'I apologise that women have had to witness this today, but in our land our women have to see the same.

'You people will never be safe. Remove your government, they don't care about you.'

In footage released by The Sun, the man 
can also be heard to say: 'You think David Cameron is going to get 
caught in the street when we start busting our guns you think 
politicians are going to die? No it's going to be the average guy, like 
you, and your children.'

The man tells the people at the scene: 'You people will never be safe. Remove your government, they don't care about you'

The footage also shows two men being detained by police on the ground

As people stand aghast at the terrifying scene unfolding in front of them, one woman is seen pulling her shopping trolley along behind her, seemingly oblivious to the horror.

As the man finishes addressing a few members of the public, he turns back towards the victim lying on his side in the road. He then talks to a second man. A blue car is parked on the pavement, a short distance from the victim in the road.

It has significant damage to its front, with debris and markings on the walkway.

The footage also shows the brave 
actions of three women who appear to be tending to the victim as he lies
in the middle of the road.

Witnesses film the drama as it unfolds on camera phones before being shepherded away by officers

The man who filmed the video of one of the alleged attackers has told ITV News he was assured he was in no danger.

He said the man with the bloodied hands approached him when he saw he was filming. He said he was told: 'No, no, no - it's cool, I just want to talk to you.'

He said the man had been able to escape, but wanted to talk about the incident.

ITV's footage then cuts to two men being detained by police on the ground nearby, while passers by mill around just behind them. Some are filming the drama as it unfolds on camera phones before being shepherded away by officers.

Eyewitnesses said the victim, who a local MP said was believed to be a soldier, was attacked by two men, with some suggesting the attackers tried to behead him.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'I have been briefed by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and the Director General of the Security Service.

'It has been confirmed to me that a man has been brutally murdered this afternoon in south east London. Two other men were shot by armed police and they are currently receiving treatment for their injuries.

'I have called a COBR (Cabinet Office Briefing Room) meeting where I will receive further briefing. This is a sickening and barbaric attack.'

David Cameron described the attack as 'truly shocking'.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister, who was planning to stay in Paris overnight after meeting the French president, would be returning tonight instead.
