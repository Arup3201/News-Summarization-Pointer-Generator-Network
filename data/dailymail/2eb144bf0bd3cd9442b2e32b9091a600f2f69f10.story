A free app which combines old and new photographs of the world's biggest cities to show how they've changed over time has been released.

Free phone app Timera works by overlaying vintage images of iconic landmarks such as London's Tower Bridge in 1892 or the Eiffel Tower in 1940, with how the locations look today.

Users can compare how cities such as London, Paris, Washington and St Petersburg, looked in the past with the present before combining the two to make unique images.

They can then upload any of the time-shifted images they create on the app to their profiles so others can look at them - much like any other social networking site.

A free phone app that allows users to look at how a selection of major cities have changed over time has been released. Here, the Timera app combines a vintage image of London Bridge with how it looks today

The app, which is available on iPhone and Android, compares images of numerous cities including Paris, St Petersburg and London - the city's Burlington Arcade in 1819 pictured

The app, available on iPhone and Android, was created by British entrepreneur David Webb, 45, who said: 'We wanted to create something that would bring history to life for the smart phone generation.'

The developer, originally from Southampton but who now lives in St Petersburg, added: 'We also wanted to enable an easy way for people to create this kind of art and share it with their friends.

'There are so many selfies and pictures of sushi out there and we wanted to give people access to a more rewarding type of photo creation that is artistic, creative and emotive.

Soldiers and civilians in Normandy, France, in 1944, pictured on a background from today. The developer was inspired to make the app after reading about photographer Larenkov's work Link to the Past

'The idea came about when I reading an
 article about a Russian photographer named Sergey Larenkov and his 
work, "Link to the Past".

'I wanted to provide a way for people to create this work instantly and easily without Photoshop skills.

'Everyone uses their phones today as personal computers, so I knew it was possible.

'I reached out to Sergey and he liked the idea and advised us on the type of effects needed.

'Working with a couple of Russian 
programmers, we quickly created a prototype to prove the concept and 
then launched into development.'

The
 project started in July, 2013 and while the app was launched earlier 
this year, it is still being worked on by a team of Americans, Russians 
and Brits.

Mr Webb added: 
'The base to a Timera image is an old photograph. Then you literally 
look through the old photo as it appears transparently over the top of 
the feed from your camera on your phone.

'Then you can add different effects. The name Timera is a mashup of Time and Camera, and gives you the ability to take photos through time.

Nevsky Prospect in St Petersburg, Russia, in 1953. The developer says the name Timera comes from a combination of words Time and Camera

'It's proving to be massively popular.

'As well as getting mashups of old and new, we have people overlaying paintings on top of Timeras or showing day and night or winter and summer in the same location.

'There is some really creative work going on and it's a treat to wake up to in the morning and see what's new.'
