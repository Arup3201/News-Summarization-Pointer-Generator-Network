Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling returned to the wizard’s magical school Hogwarts last night to host a star-studded fundraising event for her charity which helps orphaned children.

Actress Emma Watson – Hermione in the blockbuster movies of the bestselling books – attended the gala held at the Hertfordshire Warner Bros Studio where the series was filmed.

She was joined by actors Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman and Warwick Davis, film director Richard Curtis, comedian John Bishop and fashion designer Stella McCartney who were all treated to a banquet in the famous school’s dining hall.

The author was joined on the red carpet by her husband, Dr Neil Murray.

An auction was held with star items including a J.K. Rowling drawing of the book’s Sorting Hat and a sculpture by  artist Anish Kapoor.

JK Rowling hosted the star-studded event with her husband Dr Neil Murray. The event was to raise money to help reunite children with their families in Eastern Europe, and the charity is named after a Harry Potter spell

Donations raised will go towards Rowling’s Lumos charity, named after a spell  in the book, which works to help children in orphanages.

J.K. Rowling said: ‘Since setting up the charity eight years ago to help change the lives of so many children living in appalling institutions across the world, Lumos has helped governments to take nearly 12,000 children out of these institutions. 

Actor Hugh Grant also met some scary Death Eaters at the Harry Potter-themed charity event to help vulnerable children in Eastern Europe

‘We have prevented the deaths of more than 400 extremely vulnerable children with disabilities who were not receiving the care they needed in institutions.

We have helped the EU change its rules on how it uses money to reform health, education and social services – and we are just beginning.

‘There is so much more we need to  do. Tonight will go towards helping  achieve that.’
