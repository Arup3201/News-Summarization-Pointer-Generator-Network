Former Tory Shadow Minister Patrick Mercer could be the first MP in more than 60 years to be kicked out of the Commons without committing a criminal offence

Disgraced former Tory Shadow Minister Patrick Mercer could be the first MP in more than 60 years to be kicked out of the Commons without committing a criminal offence.

Parliamentary standards watchdogs are now considering demanding his expulsion over ‘grave’ new allegations against him breaching Commons rules.

The MP referred himself to the Commons standards committee after he was caught up in a cash-for-questions probe last year.

Newark MP Mr Mercer was accused of agreeing to set up  a parliamentary group at the request of undercover reporters posing as lobbyists aiming to lift Fiji’s suspension from the Commonwealth.

He was covertly filmed appearing to offer a Commons security pass to a fake firm that paid him thousands of pounds to ask parliamentary questions even though Commons rules ban MPs from undertaking such ‘paid advocacy’.

Until last week, Mr Mercer was expected to be suspended from the Commons for up to six months in line with punishment already handed out to Labour peers caught in a separate lobbying sting.

But Commons sources last night claimed that new evidence had now been unearthed which could lead to him being kicked out. One said: ‘It’s very serious and all options are now being considered.’

The Mail on Sunday understands the allegations relate to misuse of the portcullis symbol of the Houses of Parliament.

The Commons standards committee is due to hand down its judgment on Mr Mercer after Parliament’s Easter recess – although any demand for expulsion will have to be voted on by the Commons as a whole.

He would be the first  MP in 67 years to be expelled from the Commons without having committed a criminal offence.

In 1947, Labour’s Garry Allighan was ejected after accusing colleagues of offering private parliamentary information to newspapers for cash while doing it himself.

A former Army colonel with a distinguished military record, Mr Mercer entered the Commons in 2001 and served as Shadow Minister for Homeland Security.

The MP may be kicked out of the Commons in light of new evidence, sources revealed last night

In 2007, David Cameron sacked him for an interview in which he suggested that being called a ‘black b*****d’ was a normal part of Army life. Since then he has been an outspoken critic of the PM.

But the expulsion would present the Tories with a potentially disastrous by-election in an area where UKIP could pick up its first Westminster seat.

Mr Mercer last night said  he had co-operated ‘fully’ with the inquiry but declined to comment further.
