The Earl of Cardigan accused his son of being greedy

The Earl of Cardigan has accused his son of being greedy after he claims he went along with a decision to sell his ancestral home. 

The 61-year-old Earl lost his battle to stop the sale of Tottenham House in Wiltshire, a Grade I listed estate with 100 rooms. 

He had been embroiled in a bitter legal battle over the sale of the mansion in the 4,500 acre Savernake Estate, outside Marlborough, Wiltshire, to an unnamed buyer - Mr. A - for £11.25m.

But he lost his bid at the Court of Appeal to save the dilapidated 200 year old mansion as judges ruled it should be sold, with the proceeds shared between him and his estranged son, Viscount Savernake.

Lord Cardigan said he was ashamed his son had gone along with the decision. 

He told The Times: 'To my shame, my son has acquiesced in this appalling blow inflicted on my family's historic estate, and somehow I have to try to put that down to youthful greed and somehow forgive him.' 

He said he was disappointed because his father, the 9th Marquess of Ailesbury, had given the greater share of the estate to Viscount Savernake in a bid to keep it in the family.

The Eton-educated Earl had claimed the estate was worth much more than the trustees were planning to sell it for and claimed the price was inadequate. 

The trustees, chartered accountant Wilson Cotton and John Moore, a barrister's clerk, had been trying to sell the property in Wiltshire.  

They claimed, much of it lay decaying because it had been unoccupied for years. 

Sitting at the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Vos said he did not gain any assistance from considering whether the trustees were right to regard Mr A's 'bird in the hand' offer as preferable to an international marketing campaign.

But he said they were 'justified in acting on competent professional advice.' 

The Earl of Cardigan has fought trustees for two years to try and save Tottenham House, his ancestral home 

Judges ruled that Tottenham House, in Wiltshire, should be sold following the bitter two year battle

Their decision to enter into the sale to Mr. A 'was one which reasonable trustees could properly take in the interests of the beneficiaries,' and dismissed the Earl's appeal.

The main beneficiary is the Earl's son Viscount Savernake, Thomas James Brudenell-Bruce, who has a controlling 51 per cent share in the estate.

The 92,000 square feet mansion has been unoccupied since the 1990's and is 'extremely dilapidated,' Lord Justice Vos added.

Together with Lord Justice Moore-Bick and Lady Justice Black he dismissed appeals by the Earl and his son Viscount Savernake - against High Court approval of the sale last December.

The Earl's dispute with the trustees  date back to 2011 when they decided to sell off some valuable paintings.

They were put up for auction after he lost another High Court fight in 2012 with the trustees over the sale.

During the proceedings, the Earl lived off a weekly state allowance of £71 and claimed he was forced to shower at a gym and wash his baby daughter in a sink.
