Dr Clive Mowforth, 57, sent out 108 leaflets to neighbours after cats killed birds in his garden

A scientist has sparked fury after he threatened neighbours with ‘drastic action’ if they do not stop their cats from going into his garden because they are killing birds.

Dr Clive Mowforth, 57, distributed 108 angry leaflets containing images of the two ‘leading killers’ on his street in Dursley, Gloucestershire.

The threats have left the Oxford University-educated research chemists’ neighbours concerned for their pets’ safety.

But Dr Mowforth explained he had to take action after he witnessed three birds being killed in the last week.

He has spent the last ten years transforming his garden into a paradise for the local wildlife but recently noticed less birds and more cats.

He said: ‘We had a lot of different birds in the garden - starlings, sparrows and blue tits, but now we have got very few birds in the garden and a lot more cats.

‘Putting two and two together the cats are coming into the garden and eating the birds. There are about ten cats coming in total.

‘The final straw for me was when I was sat eating dinner and I saw a cat leap up onto the bird table and kill a goldfinch.’

He continued: ‘Usually there is about one bird a month killed in the garden but this month there have been three. I’ve had enough.

‘I decided to write the leaflet and put it through the letter box of 108 doors in the area. I spoke to one person whilst I was doing it and he didn’t seem to have a problem with it.

‘But now I’ve heard that it’s all kicking off on Facebook and one person is threatening to firebomb my house.’

He has since defended his actions, saying he thought it was entirely possible for people to control their cats and if not he is planning on buying something that will scare them away.

‘If my dog was going around doing this all hell would break loose,’ he said.

‘There are things people can do - if they attach bells to them the birds can hear them coming for example.

‘This could now push me out of my house. I’m about to retire and I want to be able to enjoy my garden.’

‘I am now planning on getting something from America, I won’t disclose what, which will scare them away.

‘I don’t plan on killing them but I want my garden back for the birds.’

The leaflet, which is titled ‘cat menace’, includes pictures of cats that have been caught in his garden, as well as dates of birds’ deaths.

One of Dr Mowforth’s neighbours, Amanda Woods has two cats, one of which belongs to her nine-year-old son Brandon Allen.

‘There is nothing you can do to stop your cats going in other people’s gardens - unless you have house cats,’ said the 39-year-old.

‘One of the cats is my son’s and he got really upset when he saw the letter.

‘We all got leaflets through the door, it’s all over Facebook - it really has upset a lot of people.

‘If he doesn’t like cats in his garden there are things he could do about it. He could just spray them, or set up sprinklers. It’s harmless and it means they won’t come back.

‘My neighbour thought about taking the leaflet to the local police station, I’m not sure if he has yet. If they don’t take it to the police I’d happily do it myself.’

As well as the 26 neighbouring houses on Dr Mowforth’s street, the letters have also been put through the doors of adjoining streets.

One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, was shocked when she noticed her cat was one of those pictured.

She said: ‘Everyone in the street got one of these letters through the door.

‘I was actually quite shocked when I saw it. My cat is actually pictured on the front of the leaflet.

‘I think the whole thing is a bit like Crimewatch for cats, it all seems very petty.

‘I was actually really concerned when I read the bit about him taking “drastic action” against the cats.

‘I don’t know what it could be but it certainly sounds very worrying - I’m sure the RSPCA would be interested to hear about it.

‘I haven’t bothered confronting him because I don’t want to cause a big argument but I know he has upset a lot of people.’
