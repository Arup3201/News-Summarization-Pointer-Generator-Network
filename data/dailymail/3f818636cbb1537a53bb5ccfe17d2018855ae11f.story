In chilling detail, a French hiker who stumbled on the aftermath of the Alps massacre yesterday revealed how he was convinced one of the two girls who survived the shootings was dead.

The 41-year-old man said he found Zainab Al-Hilli, seven, lying on the ground close to where her parents and grandmother had been executed in the family's BMW estate.

Zainab, who was shot in the shoulder and suffered a fractured skull after being pistol-whipped, was showing no signs of life.

Horrifying: Philippe, an experienced walker who lives locally, then ran up to the car park, where the bodies of the Al-Hilli family were all lying dead inside their BMW car

'I then leaned over the little girl,' said the local man, who identified himself as 'Philippe D'.

'She did not reply to our calls. I clapped my hands, but she was not reacting. I even said a few words in English, as I saw the car had British licence plates, but nothing happened. As far as I was concerned she was dead.'

As a French judge and prosecutor travel to Britain as part of their inquiries, Philippe is the first witness to speak publicly about the brutal murders of British engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, her mother Suhaila  Al-Allaf, 74, and Sylvain Mollier, a  45-year-old French cyclist.

Each of the murder victims were shot twice in the head last Wednesday at a secluded spot on the outskirts of the village of Chevaline, close to Lake Annecy in eastern France.

Philippe and two women friends were driving towards the scene about 4.10pm, when a 'terrified cyclist' came hurtling towards them.

The cyclist was the unidentified retired British RAF veteran who had stumbled on the murder scene, but who had been unable to call for help.

'This man was in a panic and coming down the road,' said Philippe. 'He explained to me in bad French that there was a drama a little higher up.

'He was trying to call an ambulance. I did not know if he didn't have a mobile phone, or if his phone network was not connecting at this point.'

Philippe ran up to the car park, where the bodies of the Al-Hilli family were inside their car. 'I understood what was happening straight away,' he told Le Parisien newspaper. 'I approached the car. I did not touch anything, but I could see there was nothing more to be done. There was no sign of life.

'There wasn't a sound - it was like in a movie, one of those TV series where everything begins with a murder. Except this time the actors were us, and we didn't have the remote control to change the channel.

'We did not know whether we were alone or not or whether we were in danger or not - whether the people who had done this were still there or not. We thought we were taking risks. The arrival of the emergency services reassured us.'

Unbeknown to him, the Al-Hillis' four-year-old daughter Zeena was hiding under her mother's corpse in the BMW. It would be eight hours before she was discovered.

Lying motionless nearby was Zainab, who is making a steady recovery from her injuries and is set to become the prime witness in the case.

A few seconds after wrongly concluding she was dead, Philippe went back down the hill to call the emergency services. His was the first registered call to police.

'If we had been there a few minutes earlier it could have been us who were dead, rather than the French cyclist,' said Philippe. As he went up the forest road before discovering the carnage, Philippe said he had 'heard nothing and come across not a single person, no car, no bike'.

This supports the theory that the gunman, or gunmen, may have been in place waiting to ambush their victims, or else had arrived by an isolated mountain path.

Despite being heavily sedated, Zainab Al-Hilli said she was 'still frightened' by what she saw after coming out of her coma at the CHU hospital in Grenoble

According to reports, little Zainab will be shown photographs of the murder scene in an attempt to get her to identify the gunmen.

Specialists officers are preparing to interview her, after she emerged from an induced coma at Grenoble University Hospital. In her first haunting words since regaining consciousness, the orphan reportedly said: 'I was scared. What is happening?'

Meanwhile, the son of victim Mrs Al-Allaf has a history of mental health problems and allegedly repeatedly threatened to kill his parents.

Haydar Thaher Al-Saffar, 46, regularly attacked the elderly couple at their home in Stockholm, it was claimed.

Mr Al-Saffar, who blamed his parents for his mental illness, was arrested on several occasions and was once accused of beating his dying father with his own walking stick.

Last night, as police continued to investigate the brutal killings of his mother, sister and brother-in-law, Mr Al-Saffar's whereabouts were unknown.

It is also believed that detectives 
are looking into Mr al-Hilli's profession, with reports emerging that he
was working as a contractor for a satellite technology company in 
Surrey.

Witnesses have
said they saw a green four-wheel-drive vehicle in the area at the time 
of the killings, and possibly a motorbike.

Investigators
found 25 used cartridge cartridges at the scene - a car park in the 
Combe d'Ire forest near Chevaline - while two mobile phones found in the
al-Hilli's bullet-ridden BMW estate are being analysed by police.
