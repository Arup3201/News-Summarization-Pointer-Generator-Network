The bus tour of a city is one of the great clichés of travel.

And perhaps one of the most dreary ways to see a major metropolis. You plonk yourself on a seat by the window, and listen to an unenthusiastic guide drone on about some monument or other, in a voice that says they’ve done this spiel about a thousand times before. Which, of course, they have.

But there is nothing dreary – and certainly nothing clichéd – about the new bus tour which is set to bring drama, and just a hint of danger, to the streets of Tokyo.

More than your average tour: Tokyo is now offering the 'Samurai and Ninja Safari'

Feel the pain: Costumed actors will stage battles between samurai warriors and ninjas as part of the tour

Tourists who like their travel to come with a little flair can now book themselves onto a ‘Samurai and Ninja Safari’ jaunt around the Japanese capital – a one-hour itinerary that involves flying fists and roars of pain as costumed figures throw themselves into combat.

Launched by JTB – Japan’s biggest bus tour operator – in conjunction with an events company SGRS, the ‘safari’ will offer visitors a taste of Japanese history that goes far beyond a dusty map in a museum, or a quick docu-film on the country’s military past.

Fleet-footed: 'Fights' will take place outside the bus, with tourists able to look on from the safety of their seats

Stealthy living: The tour will attempt to bring Japan's medieval history to life for a modern generation

The first half of the tour will be a standard route through some of Tokyo’s key areas.

But once the bus enters Asakusa – a part of the city famed for its temples and visible heritage – things will get a little feisty. And, if you will, a little 'fisty'.

Street performers dressed as both samurais and ninjas will burst out of the shadows and leap into battle, assailing each other with a range of acrobatic kicks and athletic blows.

Parts will be played by actors from the Tokyo pantomime group Gabez.

Have some of that: Samurais were the knights of 16th century Japan, and carried the traditional katana sword

In your face, mate: Ninjas were covert figures - though there is nothing too covert about this fight here

Tourists will look on from the bus as the action unfolds outside.

The organisers hope that the idea will prove popular with visitors who want a little more from their sight-seeing.

‘It’s theatre in motion,’ says Kazuhiro Kumade of SGRS.

‘As the samurai and ninja battle in Asakusa, passengers can enjoy it from inside the bus.’

The best tickets for the tour – seats with the clearest views – will cost around £40.

The tour is not entirely unprecedented. New York currently offers a trip called The Ride, which runs on a similar basis – with theatrical performances taking place along the route.

There's more where that came from: The tour is described by its organisers as 'theatre in motion'

Ninjas and samurai are a fundamental part of Japanese history.

Samurai warriors were the Japanese equivalent of the knights of medieval Europe – guided by a strict code of conduct, and clad in thick suits of armour, usually made of iron or leather, bound by small straps.

In the 16th century, many of them carried the katana – the traditional curved sword which has become a recognisable symbol of Japanese lore.

Ninjas, by contrast, were covert figures – mercenaries and spies who were allowed to operate between the rules, their effectiveness based on stealth and invisibility.
