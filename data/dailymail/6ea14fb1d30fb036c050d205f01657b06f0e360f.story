Agony: Catherine Moretti was bitten on the bottom by a false widow spider

A nurse was left in agony after being bitten on the bottom by a false widow spider that had crawled into her onesie.

Catherine Moretti, 44, from Southport, was at home with her son watching television when she was bitten.

She said: 'I felt something bite me and it became really itchy, but at first I thought it was just psychological.

'But by Tuesday morning it had swollen, become really red and felt hot and very uncomfortable. I couldn’t even sit down'

Ms Moretti was given antibiotics by her GP but they made no difference and the following day the bite turned jet black.

'By this point I was terrified, so I went to the minor injuries unit at Ormskirk Hospital', she said.

'They advised that I stay and have it checked out but I was due to fly to Switzerland the next day and as I have health insurance there, I decided to take the trip as planned.'

While in Switzerland, Ms Moretti's bite worsened and she began to suffer necrosis, which can lead to gangrene.

She said: 'By Sunday, the bite had become really nasty.

'There was a gaping hole underneath and it was oozing quite badly.

'A Swiss doctor informed me that the antibiotics I had been given in the UK were useless and wanted me to have an operation there to have the wound drained and cleaned.

'I couldn’t, as I needed to fly home days later, so I had to make do with a much stronger form of antibiotics and some heavy duty painkillers.'

Fashion statement: Onesies have become increasingly popular in recent years

Luckily, the medicine seems to have worked and Ms Moretti is now on the way to recovery.

She wants her story to serve as a warning to others.

She said: 'I don’t want to scare people but I want them to be mindful that poisonous spiders do exist in this country.

'As far as I am aware, the media has only reported incidents in the south of England up to now.

'I believe there has been a false widow spider in my home at least once before, as I remember seeing a spider in the summer with a peculiar pattern on its back.'

The false widow spider, or Steatoda Nobilis, has been cited as Britain’s most venomous arachnid.

It has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream coloured markings that are often said to look like a skull.

False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions
 of false widows, pictured right, Britain's most poisonous spider, are 
found across the UK and the population is growing.

Also known as Steatoda Nobilis, it is frequently confused with the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.

It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The
 species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a
 skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size.

The
 Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is 
spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in 
southern England.

This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE

The
 key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it 
because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened.

To
 avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the
 only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the 
four legs.

Do not leave
 clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in 
them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight.

If
 you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with 
your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if 
you are storing things.

If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.
