Vile: Isle of Wight Crown court heard Anton Barnes, 22, pictured, met his victim years earlier and fantasised about having a sexual relationship with her

A rapist lured a woman to his house using a fake Facebook profile, before drugging, handcuffing and attacking her.

Isle of Wight Crown court heard vile Anton Barnes, 22, met his victim years earlier and fantasised about having a sexual relationship with her.

After years of no contact with his 22-year-old victim, Barnes searched for her on Facebook and created a false identity on the social networking site to befriend her.

After developing a relationship they discussed the idea of her coming to the house, which he shared with his mother in Cowes, to have sex.

Knowing that his mother would be out of the house, he told her to let herself in and have a 'cocktail' he had made her - which actually contained sleeping pills.

Prosecuting, Anthony Bailey, said: 'There was no contact for five years, but the defendant had fantasised about having a sexual relationship with her.'

'He admitted searching for her on Facebook and creating a false profile to lure her to his house with the intention of having sex with her. He knew his mother would be out,' said Mr Bailey.

They agreed to meet on a date in September last year, at around 4pm, but when she arrived at the house, she found no-one was home.

She texted Barnes and he said he was out shopping, but she could let herself in.

They previously discussed cocktails online and in his text he said he had left her a drink made from a 'home-made' recipe.

The drink was milky coloured and smelled of lemon. She was suspicious and texted him to ask if it was drugged.

He said no and she drank it.

The drink was later discovered to have contained four crushed Loprazalam tablets, a prescribed drug for insomnia that Barnes had taken from his grandfather.

The concoction had an almost immediate effect, the prosecution said.

She had difficulty moving and tried to text Barnes, but later told police her fingers would not work.

She lost consciousness and awoke on the sofa in the living room, handcuffed with duct tape over her eyes, before she was carried upstairs and raped, said Mr Bailey.

'She felt stupid and dirty. The rape was unprotected and she had to wait for four months for an HIV test,' said Mr Bailey.

After the ordeal, Barnes loosened one of the restraints when she complained her watch was digging into her wrist.

She was able to pull her blindfold down and see her attacker.

'He vision was blurred at first, but she immediately recognised him as the defendant, not the person she had been talking to on Facebook,' said Mr Bailey.

He brought her clothes back into the bedroom. Still dazed by the drugs, she got dressed and left the house.

She called a friend, who arranged for another friend to collect her and they went to the police.

Barnes was arrested that night and police found masking tape, handcuffs and a restraint bar.

He admitted he had 'gone after her' and after the attack he deactivated the Facebook account because he no longer needed it, the court heard.

Barnes claimed his victim was not bound and blindfolded until after he had helped her upstairs, but he accepted she did not consent.

He felt 'terrible' about his crime and pleaded guilty to spare her from appearing in court, said Oliver Thorne, defending.

He said he felt stupid after the attack and that his victim would have felt betrayed.

The court heard he was withdrawn and lacking in confidence because he had no job and lived with his mother.

Barnes, of previous good character, was deemed a medium risk of committing further sexual offences.

He was jailed for six years and will be released on licence in three.

Judge Richard Hetherington said Barnes was a young man and a reduced sentence was appropriate.
