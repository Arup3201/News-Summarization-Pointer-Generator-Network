A freight train derailment caused major disruption to travellers on one of Britain's busiest rail lines today.

Services on the West Coast Mainline between Milton Keynes and London Euston were cancelled during the morning rush hour after the electric locomotive came off the tracks at Bletchley in Buckinghamshire at 2.20am.

The driver, the only person on board, is thought to have escaped with minor hand injuries.

Crash: The loco caused substantial damage to overhead lines and is still in place

Disruption: Two of the four passenger lines in Bletchley are open, but the fast lines remain closed while repairs are carried out

Accident: The derailed locomotive, which was being operated on its own when it came off the tracks

The derailed locomotive was being operated by Virgin Trains

The engine – which wasn’t hauling any carriages at the time – belonged to Virgin Trains, on lease from Freightliner.

Virgin Trains, Southern and London Midland advised passengers to seek alternative routes until the line was cleared.

A Virgin Trains spokesperson told MailOnline that it would not be commenting on the incident as an investigation by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch is underway.

She advised passengers travelling from London to Birmingham to switch to Chiltern Railways from London Marylebone, and passengers from Manchester to travel south via Leeds.

She added that maps showing alternative routes are being handed out at Manchester Piccadilly and London Euston stations and that passengers should check the National Rail website for updates.

Robin Gisby, Network Rail managing director, network operations, said: 'Unfortunately there is quite substantial damage to the tracks and overhead lines following this morning’s incident.

Key area: The train derailed near Bletchley station on the West Coast Main Line

Diversion: Passengers at London Euston travelling to Birmingham are being advised to use Chiltern Railways from Marylebone instead

'Our engineers have been on site since the small hours to assist investigators and are now carrying out repairs to the tracks and overhead lines which have been damaged.'

A Network Rail spokesman added that two of the four lines running through Bletchley are now open, but that the loco is still in place while the cause of the crash is investigated, so full service cannot resume just yet.

The cold weather is not thought to have played a part in the accident.
