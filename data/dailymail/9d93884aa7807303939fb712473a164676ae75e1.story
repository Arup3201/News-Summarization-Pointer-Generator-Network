Defense Secretary Ash Carter says he wasn't irritated last month when Vice President Joe Biden groped his wife Stephanie's shoulders at his swearing in ceremony.

Carter says he found the episode rather funny.

'Oh, I laughed. I laughed,' a smiling Carter told Today's Savannah Guthrie. 'They know each other extremely well. We're great friends of the Bidens.'

The first interview of his tenure as Pentagon chief, it was the first time Carter had spoken out about the incident that had even President Barack Obama mocking his No. 2.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter, center, claims he wasn't irritated last month when Vice President Joe Biden groped his wife Stephanie's shoulders at his swearing in ceremony

The NBC interview with Today's Savannah Guthrie followed Carter on a plane back to his alma mater, Abington Senior High in Abington, Pennsylvania, and covered a range of serious, and in the case of Biden, light-hearted issues that have arisen during his first six weeks on the job at the Pentagon

'Joe rubs my shoulders, too,' the president said earlier this month during the Gridiron Clubs annual dinner, which traditionally features politicians roasting each other and their colleagues.

The awkward moment has become fodder for Biden's opponents as well, with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus telling a gathering of conservative activists that the gaffe-prone vice president shouldn't be elevated to the Oval Office because he 'can't control his mouth - or his hands.'

Carter chuckled as Guthrie asked him in the Monday interview about Biden's shoulder groping moment as they walked the halls of his alma mater, where he was to give a speech on the future of the military later that day. 

The NBC interview followed Carter on a plane back to his Pennsylvania high school, Abington Senior High, and covered a range of serious, and in the case of Biden, light-hearted issues that have arisen during his first six weeks on the job as defense secretary.

Carter backed the president's stance toward Iran, which has until today to make a deal with an international coalition of countries before the White House pursues other, less diplomatic options. 

'If there is a good agreement to have, obviously it's worth waiting for and completing the negotiations,' Carter told Gurthrie. 

When it comes to the war against ISIS in Iraq, the president's chief military strategist said it's 'too early to say' we're winning.

But 'I'm confident we will win,' he added.

Mum was the word on Bowe Bergdahl, the missing soldier whose freedom was secured last year when the president OK'd the release of five Taliban commanders. 

After a months-long review of Bergdhal's disappearance, the Army announced last week that it would charge the Afghanistan veteran with desertion, a crime that could lead to jail time.

'I really don't want to get into that,' Carter told Guthrie, citing the ongoing investigation. 

'We do have a principle that we bend over backward in favor of trying to return an American service member.'

While he publicly supports the president's position on major foreign policy and national security issues, Carter insisted that he's more than a yes man. 

'I never think about whether he's going to like what I say. I only think about whether what I'm saying to him makes sense,' Carter said, admitting that there's been at least one time already where they did not see eye to eye.
