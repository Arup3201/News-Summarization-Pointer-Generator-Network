With a perfect copy of the New Moon film poster emblazoned across her back, portraits of Edward Cullen on both ribs and the Cullen crest splashed across her breastbone, describing Cathy Ward, 52, as a Twilight fan is a bit of an understatement.

But there's more to the Twihard's tattoos than a penchant for Robert Pattison, although the self-confessed member of Team Edward admits that it does play a part.

For Cathy, her etchings are also an important reminder of how far she's come since Christmas 2009, when she weighed six stone more and was an unhappy size 24 - and a reward.

Twihard: 52-year-old Cathy Ward has spent just under £8,500 on inkings that depict characters from Twilight

Commitment: Cathy Ward's first tattoo was this full-back poster of the New Moon film

Yet trading comfort eating for Twilight tattoos hasn't come cheap, as she happily admits. So far, she has spent just under £8,500 on getting inked but expects to have spent £25,000 by the time her 'body suit' is complete.

'I've had about 91 hours of tattooing now and it's costing a small fortune,' explains Cathy, who works as a baker for the Morrisons supermarket chain in her hometown of Reading.

'I've forked out just under £8,500 and by the time I'm finished, when [my] body's completely covered, we're looking at between £17,000 and £25,000.'

Cathy's passion for ink began after a friend handed her a copy of the first Twilight book at the end of 2009.

Hooked, she quickly devoured the first novel and sped through the remaining three before buying the DVDs and soundtracks of the accompanying films.

Her first tattoo, an elaborate recreation of the film poster for New Moon, followed with more etchings added two weeks later.

'We've got the book covers, we've got the ribbon, we've got the family crest, we've got the hairpiece, we've got the chessboard from Breaking Dawn, we've got the wolf tribal symbol,' she reveals.

'I've had five wolves done and one of the last things Jacob says to [Bella] when he realises he's lost her. He said: "It would be as easy as breathing with me".'

Perfect portrait: Kristen Stewart, Taylor Lautner and, of course, Robert Pattinson have pride of place

Recovery: Mrs Ward's obsession with Twilight tattoos acts as a reminder to her of pulling through the depression and subsequent obesity after she lost her mother

But
 despite her love for the Wolf Pack - the subject of an inking currently
 underway on her left leg - it's Edward, played in the films by Robert 
Pattinson, who interests her the most.

'Obviously, I'm Team Edward so most of my tattoos are of Edward,' she explains. 'I'm definitely a Robert Pattinson fan.

'It's
 because he's not classically good looking - he's different,' she adds. 
'I'm not what I'd call good looking, I'm average and he's similar. 
Plenty of other guys in the film are better looking but he's striking in
 different way.'

Since 
discovering Twilight, Cathy has lost an incredible six stone and says 
that having the tattoos is a permanent reminder of just how far she's 
come since 1999 when the shock of losing her mother resulted in an 
unhealthy obsession with food.

'That's when I started going really hell for leather doing what I wanted and abusing my body,' remembers Cathy.

'I was sitting down, overeating, just vegetating all the time. I was ashamed of myself and what I looked like.

'When
 my friend gave me the first book and I got well and truly hooked on it,
 it kind of focused me. Of course, then I got the music, the soundtracks
 to all of the movies, so I got them out, I'd exercise to them and I'd 
be watching a DVD and I'd just be exercising in front of them.

'And then I'd get another tattoo and it'd just give me something to focus on. I've lost six stone and that's what did it.

'It's a permanent reminder and a reward to me for getting my life back on track to what it should be.'

But
 not everyone is as supportive of Cathy's decision to get inked. 
Although her husband Colin, to whom she's been married for 21 years, 
tolerates her tattoos, not everyone in her family agrees.

'My
 father, at first he was very resistant,' she says. 'He wouldn't be seen
 out with me. My brother, I haven't spoken to in five years. He's quite 
embarrassed by me.

'My 
sisters... they're just quite glad to see me come out of my shell and be
 who I should be. I used to be very quiet, sort of hide in the 
background, be a bit of a wallflower.'

She
 certainly isn't anymore and revels in the stir she caused when she was 
invited onto the red carpet at the Breaking Dawn part one premiere in 
2011.

'I got sent tickets to
 the premiere, which was brilliant although security wouldn't let me 
near the main characters,' remembers Cathy with a chuckle.

'But the fans reaction was brilliant - it was an hour and a half of mayhem because they all wanted pictures with me.'

Her
 tattoos also got her the attention of Taylor Lautner, the 21-year-old 
American who plays Jacob, who, to her delight, even mentioned her in an 
interview.

Tolerant: Cathy's husband Colin says he is happy for her to have tattoos provided they don't go on her face

Quote: Her right arm shows a line uttered by Jacob that reads: 'It would be as easy as breathing with me'

So far Mrs Ward's spent 91 hours under the needle, costing her £8,500, but she still plans lots more and aims to cover her entire body

'Taylor Lautner 
and Rob [Pattinson] were on This Morning when Breaking Dawn came out and
 he [Lautner] commented on my tattoos,' adds Cathy.

And
 Lautner isn't alone in his appreciation of Cathy's tattoo tribute. At a
 convention last year, she met MyAnna Buring who plays Tanya, a member 
of the Denali coven who come to the Cullen's aid during a confrontation 
with the Volturi.

'I've not 
met any of the main characters,' explains Cathy, 'but I have met Tanya 
(Buring), Seth (Booboo Stewart) and the guy who plays Jared (Bronson 
Pelletier).

'It was at a 
convention last year and they all said it was brilliant artwork but to 
meet one of the main [characters] would have been great.'

For
 now, Cathy is focusing on finishing a tattoo of the Wolf Pack on her 
left leg and, once it's done, plans to have another of the Volturi inked
 on her right.

Does she have
 any plans to stop? Unsurprisingly, the answer is no. 'The way I look at
 it, I've still got two to three years work to go and you need to do 
maintenance,' she explains. 'There's always going to be things that need
 touching up or recolouring.

'I
 stand out, I don't care that I stand out,' she adds. 'This is me, this 
is what I like, this is what does it for me. It keeps me feeling young.

'It's keeping me permanently broke but no matter what the cost, I am not stopping!'

Mrs Ward says she piled on the pounds after the death of her mother, and spent most days comfort eating on the sofa
