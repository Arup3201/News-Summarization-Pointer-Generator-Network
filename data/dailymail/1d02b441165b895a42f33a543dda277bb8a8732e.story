Tottenham Hotspur commemorated the 10-year anniversary of the death of Bill Nicholson before their game against Newcastle at White Hart Lane on Sunday. 

Nicholson, the most influential manager in the club's history, was honoured with a minute's applause, while Tottenham's players wore specially-made t-shirts and a host of former stars also paid their respect on the touchline.

Darren Anderton, Martin Chivers, Ray Clemence and Pat Jennings were among those paying tributes ahead of the 1.30pm kick-off with the family of Nicholson also pitchside.

Tottenham's players wore special t-shirts during their warm-up with Nicholson's famous 'Echo of Glory' phrase

T-shirts worn by the Tottenham players during their warm up had 'Echo of Glory' written on the front. The phrase was made famous when Nicholson said: 'It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high, so high in fact that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.' 

Tottenham also produced a special souvenir match-day programme, which reportedly included never-before-seen photographs of his time at the club, as well as a free commemorative pin badge.

The club also took the decision in the summer to pay tribute to Nicholson with their new kits. Tottenham's home kit for the season features the 'Echo of Glory' quote, while the away kit features 11 golden stripes representing the 11 trophies he won during his time at the club. 

Nicholson made more than 300 appearances for Tottenham before a spell as manager from 1958 to 1974 

During his 16 years at the club, Tottenham became the first British club  to win a major European trophy after clinching the 1963 Cup Winners Cup and the first club to win a League and Cup double in 1961.
