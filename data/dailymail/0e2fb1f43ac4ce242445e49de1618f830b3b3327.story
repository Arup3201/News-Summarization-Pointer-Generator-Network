A runner has suffered a setback in his training for a charity triathlon after discovering he is allergic to running.

Within minutes of returning from intensive training runs, Ben Dixon, 29, finds his eyes swell up so much he can barely see.

And as the extreme puffiness takes up to three days to go down, medical physicist Ben is embarrassed to face his colleagues at work because they think he's been in a fight.

An eyesore: Ben is ashamed of his face when suffering an uncomfortable flare-up

Ben's wife Maria (right) believes he suffering with urticaria, more commonly known as hives.

The allergic reaction, which also causes his whole body to come out in pink bumps, has baffled Ben's GP wife Maria, 30.

Ben, who lives in Gateshead, said: ‘It only ever happens when I run really hard, nothing else brings it on.

‘I know it's not hayfever because it happens at all times of year and it's not an allergy to sweat because it never happens with other sports.

‘I've joined Saltwell Harriers running club and the other day I did their three mile club race and really went for it, sprinting at the end.

‘Within ten minutes of finishing I could feel my eyes starting to itch and then they just blew up - I could hardly see.

'I look absolutely ridiculous and it's really embarrassing - I end up trying not to make eye contact with anyone.

Ben has tried taking antihistamines, but they make no difference during flare-up.

Maria believes Ben's allergic reaction is exercise-induced urticaria, more commonly known as hives.

Chris (left) and Ben (centre), pictured here with Ben's wife Maria (right), were the best of friends.

Indeed there is a specific type of urticaria called exercise urticaria.

Exercise triggers the flare-up because it stimulates the activity of mast cells, a type of 
connective tissue cell.

When the cells are put under stress, such as when a person is training intensively, they release a substance called histamine. It 
is this chemical that triggers the swelling

Ben, who works at James Cook University 
Hospital in Middlesbrough, said he has suffered the allergic reaction 
about 20 times and it always occurs after pushing himself particularly 
hard during a run.

He is training for The Outlaw Half Ironman Triathlon in Nottingham in June in memory of his friend Chris Bygate.

Chris died tragically aged 30 last October after falling 100ft while walking in the Lake District with his fiance Gar-Ling Ng.

The couple, who lived together in Derby, were due to marry this May.

Ben is doing a triathlon in memory of his late friend Chris (pictured), who was a keen runner.

Gar-Ling, Chris's sister Lorna Smith and a team of 29 friends including Ben have entered the triathlon in a bid to raise £20,000 for the Great North Air Ambulance, whose paramedics were first on scene after Chris's accident and gave him the best chance of survival.

The epic challenge is half the distance of a full Ironman Triathlon and involves a 1.2 mile swim, a 56 mile bike ride and a 13.1 mile run.

Ben, who met Chris while they were both students at Durham University, said: "Chris did a full Ironman Triathlon last year and I know he would be laughing his head off at us all doing this.

'He was someone who lived life to the full, not only in terms of his amazing achievements but also in his home life.

'He always had warm words and a huge smile for his friends and family and was such an uplifting and positive person to be around.

'He was totally inspirational and I'm truly privileged to have called him my friend.'

Chris, who worked as an engineer for Rolls Royce, died in hospital four days after the accident and saved the lives of two other people by donating his organs after his death.

Urticaria or hives is a raised, itchy rash that appears on the skin.

It can be limited to one part of the body or spread across large areas.

It occurs when high levels of histamine are released in the skin.

Allergic reaction, extreme hot or cold, infection and some foods can trigger an attack.

However, in over 50% of cases, no cause can be found.

If it clears completely within six weeks, it is known as acute urticaria.

Treatment usually involves taking antihistamines, although in severe cases steroids can be prescribed.

Long-term urticaria may require treatment from a dermatologist which involves medication and advice on avoiding triggers.
