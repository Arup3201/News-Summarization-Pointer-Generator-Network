NHS figures show that each year around 5.2million people visit their GPs with a blocked nose

Patients with minor complaints such as colds or dandruff are causing huge backlogs for busy GPs.

The NHS figures reveal that one in five visits to a doctor were not needed, meaning delays for those with more pressing needs or the elderly.

Other non-urgent appointments apparently booked by patients included those seeking to complain about minor cuts.

And of the 51.4million GP visits by patients across England and Wales, more than 20,000 related to travel sickness.

5.2million - almost ten percent of the figure - were for blocked noses, whilst 40,000 went to see their GP for advice about dandruff.

Medics have warned people that visiting their GP unnecessarily could lead to a backlog for other patients.

Richard Vautrey, Deputy Chair of the BMA's GP Committee told Mail Online: 'It is important that patients visit their GP if they have any concerns about their health. GPs are experts at identifying serious illness even when symptoms appear vague or trivial. Spotting health conditions early on is one of the best ways of ensuring successful long term treatment.   

'At the same time, patients do need to make sure they are using services appropriately so that unnecessary workload is not created for an NHS that is already facing increasing levels of demand and shrinking resources.'

GPs have also warned previously of the strain they are under caring for seriously ill patients who would previously have been in hospital.

Some family doctors claim they have been left ‘exhausted’ by the changes.

Family doctors had to deal with 40,000 appointments about dandruff last year

The Government wants patients with cancer, heart problems and other long-term illnesses to remain at home and be checked on by GPs.

But family doctors say it is not possible to ‘examine’, ‘investigate’ and ‘prescribe’ drugs for patients with such highly complicated illnesses in a ten-minute slot at the surgery.

Dr Chand Nagpual, a North London GP, told the British Medical Association’s annual conference in Bournemouth earlier this year the pressure was ‘physically and emotionally exhausting’.

Dr Nagpaul, who is also a senior member of the BMA, said many of his colleagues were ‘exhausted and demoralised'.

He quoted the results of a poll of 19,000 GPs that found more than 90 per cent felt stressed.
