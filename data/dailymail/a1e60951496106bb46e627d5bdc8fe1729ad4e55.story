Chelsea's preparations for the Premier League season were dealt a blow as Didier Drogba limped off less than 30 minutes into his first start since returning to the club, as Jose Mourinho's side rounded off their pre-season tour of Europe with a hard-fought win against Ferencvaros.

The former Ivory Coast international went down clutching his ankle midway through the first half and had to be replaced by Oscar after 28 minutes. Chelsea were already behind at the point, due to the left boot of former Fulham playmaker Zoltan Gera.

Ramires equalised for the visitors with an impressive dipping strike early in the second half, before substitute Cesc Fabregas netted his second goal for the Blues with a stunning individual effort nine minutes from time.

Ferencvaros: Dibusz, Bonig, Bode, Gyomber, Gera, Busai, Nagy, Nalepa, Cukic, Pavlovic, Mateos.

Chelsea: Cech, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Zouma, Luis, Mikel, Ramires, Schurrle, Willian, Torres, Drogba.

Host commentator

Thanks for following our live coverage of Chelsea's 2-1 win in Budapest against Ferencvaros.

We saw a couple of great goals on a decent night for Jose Mourinho's side. Next up they face Real Sociedad on Tuesday at Stamford Bridge before opening their Premier League campaign against Burnley.

That's that. Chelsea win their final game of their pre season tour - coming from behind at the break.

Ramires and Cesc Fabregas grabbed the goals in an excellent second half for the Blues. The only downside was Didier Drogba's injury and we await further news on that.

Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa link up - the playmaker finds Costa and puts him in on goal but the dinked finish goes narrowly wide with the 'keeper floored.

We enter stoppage time at the end of the game.

Victor Moses plays with his marker down the right and crosses it left footed. Oscar and Fabregas were both flying in for the header and the latter couldn't divert it past the 'keeper with the pair completely unmarked.

Another brilliant strike! Fabregas brings the ball in from the right wing and some brilliant dribbling takes him on a run past three defenders before he slots it past the 'keeper.

It's his second goal of pre season and he looks more than ready for his Premier League return. Great ball control, tidy finish.

Nine minutes left and Chelsea lead.

Ake instantly goes close with a header.

Marco van Ginkel on for Mo Salah - who himself had come on as a replacement at half time.

Nathan Ake on for Kurt Zouma

Eden Hazard is back - a trademark drop of the shoulder takes him round the outside of the full back and he slides the ball across the box. Sadly Oscar can't quite reach it and the chance is wasted. Any touch = goal.

20 minutes left at the Groupama Arena. Chelsea are well on top and the hosts are struggling to cope with the rise in tempo. Looks like the Blues substitutes have had the required effect.

The Nigerian winger replaces Azpilicueta on the field. He'll need to impress here to get into Jose Mourinho's thoughts - or those of another manager considering a move.

How did that not go in?!? Fabregas delivered the ball into the box and Cahill flicks it onto the post and then Ivanovic couldn't quite knock in the rebound with the 'keeper sprawling.

Then the hosts run straight up the other end and they have a two-on-one but they waste the opportunity.

Nemanja Matic comes on for John Obi Mikel while Eden Hazard replaces Ramires.

Hazard moves in to the No 10 role.

Oscar should have put Chelsea ahead there. He latches on to an excellent Ramires through ball but he can't do it justice and his hesitation ruins the chance.

Looks like Eden Hazard is the next replacement coming on.

Two subs combine: Gary Cahill is unmarked in the box and directs Cesc Fabregas' corner at goal with a stooping header but it's well saved by the substitute 'keeper.

Fantastic finish from the Brazilian! A deflected Mo Salah cross comes to Chelsea's No 7 on the edge of the box and he blasts a dipping finish into the 'keeper's top corner!

He took the ball down with an exquisite touch before swinging his left boot at it to level the scores at the Groupama Arena after 51 minutes.

LOADS of changes at the break for Chelsea.

Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Mo Salah, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Mark Schwarzer replace Fernando Torres, Andre Schurrle, Filipe Luis, Willian, Andreas Christensen and Petr Cech.

Didier Drogba looked the brightest he has so far for Chelsea but Jose Mourinho will be worried about his injury that could reduce him to just two fit strikers.

The Ivorian hurt his right ankle coming down from an aerial challenge but tried to continue before leaving the field of play.

Andre Schurrle has looked good, showing pace on the right flank to stretch the defence but he has so far been unable to provide the ammunition to Fernando Torres since he moved central.

That's it for the first half. Chelsea not overly impressive and they trail courtesy of Zoltan Gera's 17th minute goal. They started brightly but have since faded.

More concerning though was Didier Drogba limping off injured with just eight days til the Blues kick off their Premier League campaign.

Andre Schurrle has been the best player in Blue and he's only supposed to be half-fit - expect a few changes from Mourinho at the break.

It's a bit of a Raheem Sterling moment here. Willian goes down and Schurrle bends in a brilliant free kick from 25 yards out.

It looks like it goes nestles in the back of the net but on the replays it actually hit the stanchion and ended up behind the goal. False alarm.

Daniel Nagy goes down under a challenge from Filipe Luis in the Chelsea area and claims for a penalty.

The referee waves away his protest though and replays show it was a good tackle by the Chelsea new boy.

Meanwhile, Gary Cahill, Cesc Fabregas and Branislav Ivanovic are warming up on the touchline. 

Cesar Azpilicueta drives a shot wide for Chelsea - bit of a rarity there. And it has Eden Hazard doubled up in laughter on the bench as it zips wide of the goal.

Didier Drogba hobbles off towards the bench now - boot off and he can't continue.

Brazilian midfielder Oscar replaces the veteran striker. Looks like Torres will go into the No 9 role now.

Drogba's back on but he doesn't look comfortable. You'd imagine Jose Mourinho wouldn't risk him carrying on in a friendly if it's serious though.

Didier Drogba is down injured inside the Ferencvaros box. Let's hope it's just one of his playacting routines.

There didn't look to be much contact with the 'keeper but he turned his ankle as he landed from an aerial challenge.

Not great - by all standards. It must be difficult for the former Liverpool man out of position on the left wing - but here's another comical vine as he knocks a ball out for a throw in.

Jose Mourinho doesn't look best impressed...

Former Fulham and West Brom man Zoltan Gera gives the hosts the lead at the Groupama Arena.

A simple finish well executed as he tucks home a cross with Kurt Zouma caught ball-watching.

Drogba's at the heart of everything here for Chelsea - he finally looks fit after some mixed appearances as a sub previously in pre season.

This time he gets away from his marker but he doesn't hit the shot cleanly from the edge of the box and it's easily gathered by the 'keeper.

Close! Drogba hits a cross after drifting out to the right wing but it's mishit and flies towards goal. Luckily Dibusz was there to tip it away.

The game is opening up a bit now - Didier Drogba (deflected) and Andre Schurrle both have efforts beaten away by Denes Dibusz in the Feren goal.

Pretty low key start from both sides so far. But Ferencvaros look to have had the best chance with Daniel Nagy blazing over a decent opportunity eight yards out.

To partially save his embarrassment the linesman has his flag up.

The home side get the game underway at the Groupama Arena.

We're not far from the 7.45pm kick off now.

Victor Moses is among the Chelsea substitutes - he's sporting the No 18 shirt. How many appearances is he likely to get this season?

Jose Mourinho will be taking this seriously - but probably not as seriously as the Hungarians. Their president is here for the opening of the new stadium, and they've just had their air force flying overhead.

With the young Belgian pretender still out with a minor injury niggle, Petr Cech has another chance to show what he can do in goal.

Here he is taking a cross from Mark Schwarzer during the warm up.

The big news from Budapest is that Didier Drogba makes his first start since returning to Chelsea - and the big man will lead the line alongside Fernando Torres.

Other summer signings Filipe Luis and Kurt Zouma both also start while 18-year-old Andreas Christensen is in Jose Mourinho's line up too.

It's already looking busy at the brand new Groupama Arena.
