If you were hoping for a little respite from the cold weather, the prospects are not looking good.

A cold snap will take hold of Britain over the next few days as freezing winds sweep across the nation.

Strong gusts of up to 50mph will mean that temperatures hovering around freezing point could feel more like -10 degrees in some areas.

The chilly winds and overnight frosts will cover all of Britain, while the east will be affected by light snow flurries.

Large swathes of the South-West and West Coast will be sunny today and tomorrow, while the East faces snow flurries and clouds

In the West Midlands night temperatures are expected to plunge to -4C, while tomorrow could see London and the South-East hit by snow.

The temperatures are much colder than normal for this time of year, a weather expert said, when we should expect averages of around six to eight degrees.

Billy Payne, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'It's certainly going to feel much colder today and over the weekend.

'Temperatures are expected to stay just above freezing point throughout the day, but with the wind chill factor it could feel more like than -5 degrees, or even -10 degrees where the winds are strongest.

'They could hit around 50mph in Cornwall, while the rest of Britain will see gusts of around 30mph and higher in exposed areas.

'These temperatures are very cold for this time of year. We expect cold weather in February but it is impressively cold really.'

On Saturday there is an increasing 
risk of snow flurries coming in from the east and spreading across the 
west towards Wales leaving a dusting of snow behind.

It will remain cold on Sunday with more wintery showers before temperatures start to rise on Monday.

The Met Office has issued a health alert amid fears the freezing weather could ravage the health 
of the elderly, young children and other vulnerable people.

The Met Office said: ‘Prolonged 
periods of cold weather can be dangerous, especially for the very young,
very old, or those with chronic diseases.’

‘This weather could increase the health risks to vulnerable patients and disrupt the delivery of services.’

A
Met Office spokesman added: ‘The main thing we’re concerned with is the
cold and how it will have an effect on health, rather than travel and 
transport.’

A Department of
Health spokesperson said: 'Severe cold weather can be dangerous, 
especially for the very young or very old or those with chronic disease.

'You
can find advice on how to reduce your risk or that of somebody you know
on the NHS Choices website, ringing NHS Direct on 0845 46 47 or 
contacting your local GP or pharmacist.

'The NHS is well prepared for the winter and we are providing an extra £330 million to the NHS and social care services to help cope with the added pressure that the winter brings.'

The cold will 
be heightened by strong winds dragged over the North Sea from 
Scandinavia and Siberia, especially in southern areas, which will also 
face ‘penetrating overnight frosts’.

The Met Office also warned that roads 
and pavements are likely to be icy over the next five days, but no major
disruption from snow is expected.

After a frosty start today, it will be a cold and breezy day across the UK with sunny spells.

The
best of the sunshine will be across western England, while central and 
eastern parts of the country will be fairly cloudy with the chance of a 
few snow flurries towards North Sea coasts.

The cold snap is set to continue into the rest of next week although the severe weather alert expires at 7am on Sunday.
