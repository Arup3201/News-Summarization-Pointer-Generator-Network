Drivers in a village in south Wales are bemused and confused after workmen painted double yellow lines - in a layby.

The lines were painted on Friday in the village of Cwmffrwd on the outskirts of Carmarthen.  

One driver spoke to one of the workmen, who admitted he had never put double yellow lines in a lay-by before.

Isn't that what a lay-by is for? The double yellow lines lines were painted on Friday in the village of Cwmffrwd on the outskirts of Carmarthen

The community council requested the double yellow lines, citing obstruction to the driveways

He told the South Wales Evening Post: 'I just don't understand it. It's a big lay-by. It's pathetic.'

Carmarthenshire’s executive board member for transport services Colin Evans said: 'The double yellow lines have been laid following request from the community council as a result of persistent obstruction and blocking of driveways.

'The order was subject to consultation and no objections were received.'

In April a council was accused of painting Britain’s most pointless double yellow lines which measure just 18in - too small to fit a single tyre.

Residents were stunned when the lines appeared in Kingston, south west London, curved around a corner kerb at a three-way junction - but barely big enough for a toy car or a unicycle.

In 2012, double yellow lines measuring just 21in also appeared in Canterbury, Kent

Motorcyclist Oliver English, who spotted the lines, said: ‘I think it's stupid and a bit pointless. The way they've made the access road look pedestrian is very dangerous for pedestrians and motorcyclists

The shortest double lines in the UK were painted in August 2013 between a taxi rank and parking bays in Central London, measuring just over 9in.

Westminster Council said it was a mistake made by a contractor, and would be corrected.

Earlier last year, double yellow lines stretching for just 13in were discovered on a street in Cambridge.

Baffled families slammed these barmy new yellow lines which measure just 21in

Cambridgeshire County Council described the lines as 'common practice'. A spokesman said: 'The yellow lines are at either end of a disabled parking bay and are there to prevent vehicles parked either side from encroaching on the disabled bay'.

Council bosses also laid down 18in double yellow lines on parking bays in Highbury Crescent, north London, in 2007.

In 2012, double yellow lines measuring just 21in also appeared in Canterbury, Kent.
