Inter Milan watched Patrice Evra on Wednesday night as they consider an offer for the Manchester United left-back.

Inter's technical director Piero Ausilio was in attendance at The Emirates Stadium for the 0-0 draw with Arsenal in the knowledge that France international Evra is out of contract in the summer.

He has interest from Monaco and Paris St Germain, however, the Italians are rebuilding their squad and also see the 32-year-old as a good free signing.

Eye on the ball: Patrice Evra in action for United against Arsenal

Evra has the same agent as United winger Luis Nani, who Inter tried to sign in January, and they have been alerted to the fact the defender is considering a fresh challenge.

Inter have already made a proposal to Evra's teammate Nemanja Vidic as they look to take the United captain on a two year contract with the option for a third year at the end of the season and the combative Serbian is believed to be close to an agreement.

Inter have Nani as a possibility in mind for the summer still but remain keen on Tottenham's Erik Lamela too if Daniel Levy will countenance a sale or loan.

United are continuing to evaluate new left-backs of their own. Southampton's Luke Shaw and Atletico Madrid's Filipe Luis remain targets. United were rebuffed in enquiries for both last month although talks will be resumed in the summer. Monaco also have an interest in Filipe. He has been out with an adductor rupture but is expected to return for the Madrid derby on March 2.

Manchester City will offload Javi Garcia in the summer as they look to recruit a new defensive midfielder.

The Premier League title contenders have agreed a deal for 20-year-old Argentine Bruno Zuculini from Racing Club but also want a player with more experience.

Garcia has failed to establish himself at Eastlands and his departure was discussed as part of negotiations over the proposed deal for Porto's Fernando and Eliaquim Mangala last month.

Fernando has since agreed a new contract at Porto but is one of City's options as they re-evaluate players for that position with Blaise Matuidi of Paris St Germain and Southampton's Victor Wanyama among the names being studied.

Garcia, 27, joined City in 2012 from Benfica for £15.8m and scored on his debut against Stoke but he has struggled to progress since alongside more illustrious performers. Napoli wanted to take him on loan last month and may come back into the market depending on City's asking price with Garcia still having three years left on contract.

Porto midfielder Fernando's agent, Antonio Araujo, told Portuguese radio yesterday that his client will move to the Premier League. Although City are considered favourites for his signature, Everton and Liverpool have shown an interest in the 26-year-old, with Everton having gone to the lengths of securing a work permit for him ahead of a failed bid last summer.

Manchester United were also offered Fernando but had reservations about his level. France international Matuidi had agreed a new contract in principle with PSG but is understood to be holding off signing it as City and Arsenal  show interest.

Wanyama was considered by City last year while at Celtic and his statistics make good reading at Southampton this season. They have conceded only 11 goals while he has been on the pitch and, since his return from injury, they have kept two clean sheets.

Zuculini, meanwhile, will join City in the summer after confirmation from Racing Club president Victor Blanco.

Talking to Argentine newspaper El Dia, Blanco said: 'We wanted to keep the side and reinforce it, but we have several highly coveted gems from the outside, such as Luciano Vietto, Rodrigo De Paul and Bruno Zuculini - who has already signed an agreement to leave in June to join Manchester City.'

Chelsea have agreed a £3million deal with Hajduk Split for midfield prospect Mario Pasalic.

MailOnline revealed talks were ongoing at the end of last month and the 19-year-old Croatia U19 international has confirmed he is moving in the summer.

Pasalic made the announcement at Hajduk Split's 103-year anniversary celebrations saying: 'The Hajduk jersey is sacred and I will miss it in the summer when I go to Chelsea.'

Chelsea will give a trial to 14-year-old Swedish prospect Almin Masic later this month. Masic from Orebro SK is a quick, wide midfielder with an eye for goal who impressed Chelsea scouts during a tournament at his hometown club last summer.

He has been invited to train for a week with Chelsea's U15 side from February 24. Masic said: 'It feels great and I'm looking forward to going there and training. It will be a good experience.'

Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is Jose Mourinho's No 1 striker target for the summer. Chelsea will look at various ways to bring in the 25-year-old who has scored 24 goals in 26 games this season.

Atletico would want the £32million buy-out clause figure as they need to bring in as much cash as possible to appease fans in any such sale.

Atletico may ask for Fernando Torres while Demba Ba could also be offered in negotiations.

Chelsea have considered Edinson Cavani but Manchester United are favourites at this stage for his signature so long as they improve their form and finish the season with a flourish.

On the move? Papiss Cisse

Papiss Cisse is a target for affluent clubs in China as they scour Europe for big name strikers ahead of their transfer window closing on February 28.

Alan Pardew can ill afford to lose another player given their current results but Cisse has struggled to rediscover his old form.

China though has proved an unhappy hunting ground for the likes of Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba, the likelihood is Cisse and Newcastle will wait until the summer.

Reports in France say Newcastle received £20m for Yohan Cabaye but are due another £3.23m in bonuses over the next 18 months for the 28 year old central midfielder.

Spartak Moscow and Dinamo Kiev are showing interest in signing Jermaine Pennant over the next few weeks.

The former Arsenal and Liverpool winger is a free agent after his contract ended with Stoke City in January. The much-travelled 31-year-old made 11 appearances for Stoke this season and scored the winner in the Premier League game at West Ham in August.

Tottenham are in discussions over a deal for Nigerian teenager Musa Yahaya. The midfielder has been linked with Manchester City recently but is due in London on Saturday to undergo medical test at Spurs Lodge and formalise a move to Tottenham.

Yahaya, likened to Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta, was part of Nigeria's U17 World Cup winning team. The 16-year-old will be accompanied by his father, one of his agents Mohammed Babawo and Auwal Yusuf who is part of the Mutunchy Academy.

Barcelona may retain an interest in Chelsea's David Luiz but Pep Guardiola remains keen on the Brazilian and will have the greater financial muscle at his disposal.

Bayern have received a cash injection of £90million after selling off an 8.33 percent stake in their stock company which will allow them to pay off their stadium debts.

Insurance company Allianz, which already holds naming rights to the team’s stadium, now shares a 25 per cent stake in the Bayern Munich Aktiengesellschaft (AG) along with other Bavaria-based brands Adidas and Audi.

Munich-bound? David Luiz is a target for all-conquering Bayern

The remaining 75 per cent belongs to the club and its members. None of the £90m will go into the day-to-day business but does allow other monies to be focused on a burgeoning player budget.

On Wednesday, the German sports weekly Sport Bild published a list of the Bayern payroll, claiming France international Franck Ribery and Germany star Mario Goetze are the top earners at the club, with an annual salary of £9.8m.

Philipp Lahm and Bastian Schweinsteiger are reported to be on £8.2m, while Toni Kroos, who has yet to renew his contract having failed to agree terms with the club, currently only earns £3.7m.

Leed will rival Sheffield Wednesday for the loan signing of Connor Wickham. The England U21 international was recalled by Gus Poyet in the last week of January from a spell at Hillsborough where he had enjoyed a productive spell with eight goals in 11 games including one in the 6-0 thrashing of Leeds.

Brian McDermott has also considered Matty Fryatt at Hull City as he looks to kick-on on the playing front while talks continue over a proposed takeover.

Coveted Hamburg defender Jonathan Tah asked not to be considered for last weekend's clash with Hertha Berlin.

MailOnline reported the 17-year-old centre-back is caught in a contract dispute with his father, agent and Hamburg and Manchester United, City and Arsenal are showing interest.

HSV sporting director Oliver Kreuzer said: 'Jonathan is not terribly difficult, but he did not play. It was simply because the boy has endured an awful lot during the week.'
