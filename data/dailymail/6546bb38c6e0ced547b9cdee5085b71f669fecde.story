Red phones boxes are few and far between these days but their status as British icons is undiminished.

But to stop them from disappearing altogether, people have been converting them for a variety of different uses.

The latest has been transformed by a group of people in Settle, North Yorkshire, who turned their red phone box into an art gallery.

Dubbed Gallery on the Green by the volunteers who run it, the converted BT phone box is free to view and open to visitors every day.

The telephone box was bought as part of a
 scheme called Adopt a Kiosk in 2009 and since then has put on 10 
exhibitions in the tiny space inside.

Roger Taylor, 72, Gallery on the Green's curator, said: 'We bought the box off the local council for £1 and all the town helped to refurbish and paint it. It started off as a place to display postcards, no more than that but has now grown into something much more sophisticated.' 

Supporter: Brian May is set to showcase his obsession with Victorian 'stereographic' photography - the 3-D of its age - in the phone box gallery in November

Queen legend Brian May has even 
confirmed that he will be showing an exhibition in the tiny gallery in 
November, showcasing his interest in Victorian 'stereographic' 
photography.

Mr Taylor said: 'I have known Brian 
for over 30 years and he has had an exhibition here before, which was so
 popular. I am delighted to hear the news that he is exhibiting again 
here.'

'We are very lucky for him to be able
 to come and do this with us. He is very enthusiastic and it is a great 
opportunity for us to showcase his exhibition in our beloved tiny 
gallery. It will be great fun.'

The Gallery on the Green has had 
visitors from as far as Australia, Japan and the US and continues to
 draw spectators to the small town, who wish to experience its quirky 
charm.

Mr Taylor said: 'The
 gallery is extremely quirky and is one of those odd things that people 
respond to. They like it because it is off the wall and a little bit 
different.'

'It is a vibrant gallery which draws people in from all over the world,' he added.

The mini-art gallery is run entirely by volunteers and is looked after by the entire community.

He said: 'It is proliferating. It acts as a role model for other villages to set up a gallery else where.'

'People have really embraced the gallery - we are excited about what the future holds for it.'

Good call: The phonebox gallery stands in an idyllic setting next-to a village post box, overlooking green fields
