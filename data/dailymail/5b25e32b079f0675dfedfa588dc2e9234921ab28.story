West Ham are set to wear their  FA Cup kit for the first time when they take on Everton in the third round replay at Upton Park on Tuesday.

But it could be the only time the Hammers fans get to see the players in the limited edition strip if they are dumped out of the competition, despite setting supporters back £49.99 for an adult shirt.

West Ham were denied a place in the fourth round last week when Romelu Lukaku cancelled out James Collins' goal in the third minute of stoppage time to set a replay.

West Ham will wear their purple FA cUp kit for the first - and maybe the last - time against Everton on Tuesday

And the Hammers will don the purple, gold and black strip for the clash on Tuesday night and at each home and away game throughout the FA Cup campaign, should they make it through to the fourth round.

A tie against Doncaster Rovers or Bristol City await West Ham in the next round if they advance at Everton's expense.

West Ham were supposed to wear the kit in the original third round match but it would have clashed with Everton's blue home kit. 

The club have urged supporters to get their hands on the replica shirt before they're gone after selling half of the 4,000 that were made.
