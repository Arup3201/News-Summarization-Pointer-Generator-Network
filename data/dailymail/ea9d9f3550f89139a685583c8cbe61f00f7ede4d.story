An Australian backpacker has been hired as a nanny by David and Samantha Cameron after a series of long distance interviews over the internet.

Sammi Strange, 24, has limited professional experience of looking after children having previously worked as an advertising sales assistant for a Melbourne television channel.

But she charmed the Prime Minister and his wife during chats on Skype and has now been trusted with their three children Nancy, eight, Arthur, six, and Florence, 20 months.

Miss Strange, the daughter of a pub owner, was first identified in the Australian press earlier this week.

She is believed to have already started the role and will be in Downing 
Street for six weeks while the Camerons' permanent nanny, Nepalese Gita 
Lama, is on leave.

Mr and Mrs Cameron were so impressed by Miss Strange 
they were able to laugh off an internet survey she had completed as a 
teenager where she admitted shoplifting, smoking and drinking.

In the survey on a social networking website the former Melbourne 
Grammar School pupil denied taking drugs ‘in the last month’ and when 
asked if she swears she replied: 'F*** yeah'.

Asked to declare the number of drugs she had taken, she replied: 'No comment'.

Miss Sammy said her first thought in the morning was that she did not 
want to get up and her top achievement would be to finish university 
that year without dropping out.

The survey also revealed she loves 
eating sushi, longs to visit Europe, that her dream job was to be an 
events manager, her weakness is maths and her biggest fear is sharks.

Miss Strange decided to leave her former  job to go travelling last 
month.

Before setting off she registered for a nanny agency,  where Mr 
and Mrs Cameron found her CV.

Before being interviewed she was told her CV was being considered by a 
'high profile' family and was left 'shaking' when she learned it was the
Camerons.

Her father David Strange, a former vice-president of an Australian Rules
football club, said his daughter was enjoying her new job but was 
concerned about the publicity it attracts.

He said: 'It’s all blown up a
bit. She is very worried about it.'

Mr Strange said he had given her an Australian Rules football to give 
as a gift to the Camerons' children to help induct them into his 
nation’s culture.

The former vice-president of St Kilda Football Club 
said: 'She was shaking when she found out who it was. She was very 
excited and nervous.

'I hope she might marry Prince Harry but I couldn’t afford the wedding.'

When the socially-conscious Camerons recruited Nepalese Mrs Lama they 
plucked her from the 'virtual slavery' of working for a family that 
refused to pay her.

The Prime Minister and his wife found Mrs Lama more than eight years ago
through a charity that helps abused domestic workers wanting to flee 
their bosses.

Miss Strange has been recruited on a temporary contract to cover for Mrs Lama.

A Downing Street spokesman dismissed the online survey, saying it had 
been filled in 'as a joke’ when Miss Strange was a teenager.
