Google has started to remove search results, following last month's 'right to be forgotten' ruling.

Europe's top court ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which led to the tech giant being bombarded with requests.

Searches for people’s names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results ‘may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’.

This warning appears on all results, regardless of the name that has been searched for, and is not an indicator that the specific person has requested links be deleted.

A Google spokesman told MailOnline: ‘This week, we’re starting to take action on the removals requests that we’ve received.

‘This is a new process for us. Each request has to be assessed individually and we’re working as quickly as possible to get through the queue.

‘We’ll continue to work with data protection authorities and others as we implement this ruling.’

Last 
month’s decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which 
affects 500 million citizens, requires that search services remove 
information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' - and 
failure to do so can result in fines.

European
 citizens can submit take-down requests directly to internet companies 
rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a 
search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress 
from the courts.

Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’.

Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.'

This particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally.

The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’

The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it.

If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined.

Last month, a MailOnline investigation uncovered that a man convicted of possessing child pornography, a misbehaving politician seeking re-election and a doctor with bad reviews, were among the flood of people who contacted Google demanding that their internet histories be deleted.

Legal experts have commented that the criteria for determining which take-down requests are legitimate, is not completely clear from the EU court’s decision.

Google has therefore had to painstakingly sort through the requests and last week sent notifications to people who requested a removal, asking them to bear with the search engine.

It began removing the first results under the European data law yesterday, and plans on ramping up the speed of the process when it is sure that the systems put in place are effective.

Google is starting its work now to show good faith in complying with the ruling, which it did not greet with enthusiasm last month.

Following the ruling, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told the company’s annual shareholder meeting: 'There's many open questions.’

'A simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know. From Google's perspective that's a balance.

'Google believes having looked at the decision, which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.’

The company is now keen to be transparent about the modification of its search results, which is why it is showing the message: ‘Your results may have been modified under data protection law in Europe,’ for all name search results, expect for celebrities.

This is so that notices do not appear next to certain individuals, but the notice could evolve over time.

Google is also notifying people who made ‘right to be forgotten’ requests that have been turned down, as well as those where more information is required.

The tech giant is not new to notice-and-takedown removals, to do with defamation, for example.

It also has experience dealing with take-down requests in its YouTube video website, which has a process to remove uploads that infringe copyrights. But the ruling marks an entirely new process for search engines.

Google is the dominant search engine in Europe, commanding about 93 per cent of the market, according to StatCounter global statistics. Microsoft Corp's Bing has 2.4 per cent and Yahoo Inc has 1.7 per cent.

A spokesman for Microsoft's Bing told MailOnline: 'We’re currently working on a special process for residents of the European Union to request blocks of specific privacy-related search results on Bing in response to searches on their names. 

'Given the many questions that have been raised about how the recent ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union should be implemented, developing an appropriate system is taking us some time.  We’ll be providing additional information about making requests soon.'
