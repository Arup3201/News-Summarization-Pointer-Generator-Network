To queue or not to queue: that has always been the question when it comes to going for drinks in a bar or pub.

Do you risk losing your table (and your mind) jostling for position behind rival boozers, or do you hang on until the queue dies down... only to watch it build up once more as your thirst becomes more extreme?

But fret no more! Now there's Orderella, a new UK-based app to help you solve this age-old dilemma by allowing you to use your mobile phone to order drinks.

Use your phone to order drinks without leaving your table thanks to the Orderella app, right, which is due to be rolled out nationwide from next month

You'll never need to leave an interesting conversation with your friends again thanks to the Orderella app (but you'll never get out of a boring one, either...)

The
Orderella app - currently being used in the Keyworth Tavern, Keyworth, 
Nottingham, and due to be rolled out nationwide from next month - lets 
pub-goers place their orders for drinks online and be alerted when the 
bartender has made them.

And you can even do this from home, 
meaning when you arrive at the pub there will be a nice chilled round 
waiting for you and your friends at your table.

Andy Crawford, operations director of the Pub People Company, which owns the Keyworth Tavern, told The Express: 'The way you order drinks in a pub hasn't changed for a thousand years. This is trying to get away from the Luddite mentality towards change in pubs.

'But customers will still be able to have friendly contact with pub staff. I think it's an extension of the relationship. Don't forget, the drink will be brought to the table by a member of staff.'

When customers order drinks the barman is notified on his iPad and begins mixing, alerting the customer via the app when their order is ready

When a customer orders drinks the barman is notified via his iPad, and when he starts making drinks the customer receives a message. He receives another when the drinks are ready.

Keyworth Tavern manager Adrian Clarke said the app is working well, and that 'people are always more comfortable when they're sat at their table than when they're stood at the bar'.

He added: 'When you have to go to the bar, you have to break that conversation mid-flow. With this, the conversation doesn't stop.'

Orderella's chief operating officer Jamal Hirani said the app should enhance the social drinking experience: 'It's about enhancing customer service, it's not taking away the customer's ability, when the pub's empty, to go to the bar and talk to the barman. It makes life a little easier.'
