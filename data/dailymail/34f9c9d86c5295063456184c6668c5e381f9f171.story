If you are caught staring at a head-turning outfit, it's normally the wearer who notices your gaze, not the clothes themselves. Until now.

A forward-thinking Chinese fashion designer has used complex sensory technology to create a dress that moves, changes shape and even lights up when it is looked at.

Montreal-based designer Ying Gao installed her high-fashion creations with eye-tracking technology so that they activate when they sense someone's gaze.

Look but don't touch: A base of glow-in-the-dark thread shines through a shredded overlay in a creation that fuses fashion and technology

Gao's loose white and ivory shift dresses are made from shredded and ruched super-organza- the world's lightest fabric.

They are sewn with photoluminescent thread and contain tiny eye-tracking electronic devices.

The gaze-activated dresses have small motors sewn into them that can move parts of the dress and make them change shape.

Sensory technology is used to transform the garments from pale, ethereal dresses into luminescent art works that resemble jellyfish.

Ying Gao explained the concept to Dezeen: 'We use an eye-tracking system so the 
dresses move when a spectator is staring, she said.

'[The 
system] can also turn off the lights, then the dresses illuminate.'

Gao said she was inspired by an essay by Paul Virilo and told TIME it is, 'about speed, light 
and disappearance, so while creating these dresses, I must have 
unconsciously related to it as the movement of jellyfish.'

Ethereal: The intricately-designed creation is made from super-organza and weighs around half a pound

Interactive: Gao's series of reactive garments include a leather coat (left) and layered cape (right) that move when light is shone on them

'Whether it is a direct visual contact 
or through a camera, the artistic concept of gaze has always appealed to
me.

Therefore, when my robotics designer Simon Laroche and I started 
working on the project, we thought a lot about how
to bring both the conceptual and technological level together,' Gao 
explained to a TIME reporter.Â
