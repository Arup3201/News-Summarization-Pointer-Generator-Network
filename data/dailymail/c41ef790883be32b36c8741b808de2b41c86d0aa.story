Mimi Anderson is no ordinary grandmother. She has conquered deserts, the Arctic and the jungle on foot in a number of gruelling 'ultra marathons'.

Now she is set to challenge herself again by running 1,460 miles across South Africa.

The 52-year-old from Kent is joining forces with Australian ultra runner Samantha Gash, 29, to take on the epic journey.

Long journey ahead: Mimi Anderson is an experienced distance runner but she said taking on the Freedom Trail in South Africa will be her biggest challenge yet

The pair will run together along the Freedom Trail, an off-road route starting in Pietermaritzburg and finishing in Paarl, just outside Cape Town.

The route requires navigational skills, river crossings and scrambling across rocks in parts and will take the pair just over a month to complete - running a total of 56 marathons back-to-back.

Although both are experienced endurance athletes, Mimi told MailOnline that taking on the Freedom Trail will be one of the hardest things she has ever done.

'For both of us this will be the biggest 
challenge of our running careers,' she said. 'Running an average of 80km per day 
for 32 days isn't something to be taken lightly and 
technical running isn't my forte.

'But I believe that in order to grow as a
 person we all need to do things that take us way out of our comfort 
zone, each time pushing just that little bit further – this project will
 push me further than I have ever pushed myself before, in many ways.'

Mimi and Samantha are putting themselves though the long-distance run with the support of NGO Save The Children Australia in order to raise money for girls and women in South Africa.

Mimi, who has achieved three World Records including being the fastest woman to run from John O'Groats to Land's End, said: 'Both of us felt that if we were to take on a challenge as big as this we wanted to raise money to help South African girls and women. Samantha is 29 and I'm 52, two women, two generations and two pairs of legs supporting others.'

Not going it alone: The grandmother-of-three, pictured here during another endurance race, will be joined by Samantha Gash as they run about 80k a day for 32 days

They are aiming to raise awareness 
and 
funds to set up of a social enterprise business in the Free State 
of South Africa that will employ a dozen South African women to make 
re-usable sanitary pads in order to keep girls in education. The pair 
were shocked at how many girls are missing out on school
because of a lack of adequate sanitary products.

Mimi explained: 'Once they reach 
puberty, one 
in three South African girls miss out on four or five days of
 school per month because they cannot afford to buy sanitary pads. 
Instead they stay at home and use anything from old rags and rolled up 
newspapers - anything they can get their hands on. Eventually 
they drop out of school altogether.'

The grandmother-of-three said 
thinking about the cause will keep her pushing on when the going gets 
tough when the race gets underway in September.

Accomplishment: Mimi has previously ran the Badwater ultra marathon in Death Valley twice in a row

She said: 'Many people have asked me 
what is driving us to run this ridiculously long distance. The answer is
 simple; we are absolutely passionate about the cause for which we are 
running. 

'We are both lucky and have had 
privileged backgrounds where education was a given, enabling us to make 
choices about our futures, the South Africa girls in rural communities 
aren't always so lucky.

'By supporting girls to remain in 
education it will enable them to make a lasting and positive impact on 
the communities they live in and society as a whole.'

Mimi is no stranger to such endeavors for charities. Her
 many other endurance feats include the fastest crossing on foot across 
Ireland (345 miles in three days, 15 hours and nearly 37 minutes), doing
 the infamous Badwater Ultra in America twice back-to-back and 
completing the Marathon Des Sables ultra in the Sahara desert.

Inspirational: Mimi only took up running at the age of 36 and it has helped her overcome an eating disorder

What makes Mimi's achievements ever 
more remarkable is that in her youth, she suffered from an eating 
disorder and only took up running at the age of 36.

It was the joy of running that gave her the impetus to overcome anorexia.

She explains: 'Running means I have to eat, otherwise my body simply wouldn't have 
enough energy. So I'm no longer afraid of food, it's not the enemy but an
 essential part of life. Running quite literally has given me back my 
life which otherwise may have turned out so differently.'
