Father-of-six Tyree Landrum was driving to one of his three jobs when he came across a line of Ferguson protesters blocking the road in the middle of the San Diego rush hour.

Furious that the demonstrators might make him late to work and risk him getting fired, he decided to get out of his car on the I-5 in La Jolla to confront the group of students.

He then told a photographer for ABC News 10: 'If I don't get there, I'm going to get fired. I've got six f****** kids to feed.'

Mr Landrum's reaction on Wednesday has since gone viral, and has drummed up support from hundreds on social media.

Meanwhile demonstrations have continued across the country in the wake of the decision by a grand jury not to indict Darren Wilson who shot unarmed teen Michael Brown.

Anger: Father-of-six Tyree Landrum shows his frustration as he arrives at a group of Ferguson protesters on the I-5 in San Diego who are making him late for work 

Frustration: Hundreds of motorists were prevented from getting to their final destination because of the demonstration during the morning rush hour 

Many other drivers around him shared his anger, including nurses in their scrubs en route the hospital, and got out of their cars.

Mr Landrum then approached one protester standing with a bullhorn shouting: 'No justice, no peace.'

He ripped the device from him and replied: 'Hey, I feel you; we ain't got no justice either.'

A woman then shouted 'arrest them' before a unit of California Highway Patrol and San Diego police arrived at the scene - half an hour after the protest started. 

As officers began talking to them, one motorists said: 'You're spending the night in jail! That's right, you're spending the night in jail tonight.' 

Face-to-face: Mr Landrum, who works three jobs in a bid to provide for his six children, then walked up to the protesters to confront them 

Tussle: At one point, Mr Landrum wrestles the bullhorn from one of the demonstrators 

However they were not arrested because police said the protest was peaceful. 

Mr Landrum's rant to the protesters went viral on Facebook, with many people coming out in support. 

Reflecting on his actions, he said that he didn't consider himself a hero but an everyday person and regrets losing his temper.

'I'm nobody special, just doing what I thought was right,' he told the station.

'And then he put this bullhorn in my face, and I'm like get this bullhorn out of my face. At that point, I was confused, frustrated and completely angry.' 

Mr Landrum was late to work, however his boss reportedly understood the situation and did not take any action. 

Ryan Fusco, a total stranger, was taken back by what Mr Landrum with and decided to help his family.

He started a YouCaring campaign to help him buy Christmas presents for each of his six children. 

Fusco told the station: 'He's obviously doing all he can to support his family. The sincerity, the passion, his willingness to stand up and do something really spoke to me.'

Mr Landrum said he thought the gesture was a blessing.
