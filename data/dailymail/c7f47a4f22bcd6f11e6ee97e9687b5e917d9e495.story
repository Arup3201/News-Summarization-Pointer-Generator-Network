Predator: Coach Scott Studer pleaded guilty to eight counts of videotaping dozens of high school basketball players in the shower between 2005 and 2012

A former high school basketball coach who pleaded guilty to videotaping boys in a locker room shower was sentenced Wednesday to 15 years in prison and ordered to give $5,000 to the Connecticut town where a gunman killed 27 people.

The judge didn't specify exactly where Scott Studer's fine should be directed, only that it go to the Newtown community.

‘I don’t care where that money comes from, but something good is going to come from this very awful situation,’ said Stark County Common Pleas Judge Frank Forchione.

Studer, 46, was sentenced after he pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with eight counts of illegal use of a minor in a nudity-oriented material or performance: one count for each of the eight seasons during which the coach spied on his students.

He was initially facing up to 64 years in prison.

After pleading guilty to each of the counts Studer issued an apology to the victims.

‘I’m so sorry for the bad things that I did. I always talked to my players about trust and respect and family. My bad decisions went against everything that I ever talked about.

‘I wish that I could take it all back and make everything better for them but I can’t. I hope someday they can find it in their hearts to forgive me but I understand if they can’t,’ he said, according to Fox8.

Assistant Stark County Prosecutor Chryssa Hartnett read statements from parents and from victims, whose names have not been made public to protect their privacy.

One of Studer’s former players wrote, ‘You were more than a coach to me, you were my hero,’ adding ‘somewhere inside you was a beast that only hungered to use us for its sick fantasies we trusted you betrayed us.’

Another letter written by one of Studer's victims said 'Coach Stu' was once his inspiration.

'I thought you were a great man,' the letter stated, 'but now all I see are lies and deceit. You have tainted the program I love and tarnished the memories we all hold most dear.'

Judge Forchione ordered the tapes destroyed after two years pending civil lawsuits or appeals.

In addition, Studer was banned for life from attending any scholastic or athletic events in Jackson Township and from making any contact with the victims.

At least 74 boys have been identified on the secretly recorded videotapes made over the span of eight years, Jackson Township police Lt. Rick Mitchell said Wednesday.

He wasn't sure whether more victims might be identified, but authorities have noted in the past that Studer may have been in contact with as many as 112 boys dating back to 2005 when it is believed that the 46-year-old began taping students in the shower. 

Prosecutors detailed the logistics of Studer's crime, explaining that he would place small cameras 'in a box or a shoe and put them in the locker room, face the shower and put towels over them and adjust them where he would be able to film the victims.'

During the investigation, police carefully examined Studer's computers and emails to see if he shared the photos or even discussed them with anyone else, but came to the conclusion that he kept them to himself.

The search of Studer's home was led by
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which hasn't commented on what led 
its investigators to him.

‘I don’t think there’s any question you have a very tortured soul to take advantage of these young men and your penalty will be severe, and not just the penalty of the clanging of the bars when they close but I think you are going to find yourself ostracized from this community forever,’ Judge Forchione told the defendant.

The parents of all those who were videotaped and the victims who are now adults have been notified, he said.

Mitchell said the community would welcome the resolution of the case.

‘I think the quicker we get it done, the better. Everyone can move on from that point,’ Mitchell said.

'Figure of trust': Scott D Studer was secretly filming his basketball students while they showered

Studer coached the freshman boys 
basketball team at Jackson High and was arrested after investigators 
searched his home and found nude images on a DVD, a computer and a flash
drive. He quit as coach and school building aide the day he was 
arrested last month.

Police 
said the videotaping involved student-athletes. There was no evidence of
videotaping in the visitor locker room, police said.

Akron Beacon Journal Online reported that under
terms of Ohio’s sentencing laws, Studer will be eligible for parole 
after serving about seven-and-a-half years, but it is not believed that 
he will be set free after serving only half of his term.

Following his release, Studer will be registered as a Level 2 sex offender.

After Studer's arrest, many parents 
were angry with how the situation has been handled by authorities. 
Mother Vicky Smith, whose son plays on the freshman basketball team, 
told Newsnet5 she was upset that the school hadn't contacted parents immediately or provided counseling.

'For
them, the school, not to have psychologists in there today working with
the boys through this, not having contacted the parents of the 
children, having to hear about it from outside sources, I'm very 
concerned,' Smith said.

Meanwhile,
students have taken to social media discuss their anger and betrayal by
a long-standing figure of trust. Many boys have recalled how Studer 
used to make students take a shower, even if they didn’t want to.

Other potential victims spoke of odd practices at showertime, such as Studer suggesting snowball fights or playing with a volleyball.
