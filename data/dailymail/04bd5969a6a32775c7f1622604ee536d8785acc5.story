Floyd Mayweather will have his next fight on September 13, ruling out a potential meeting with Amir Khan.

Fresh from beating Marcos Maidana and unifying welterweight titles two weeks ago, Mayweather Promotions chief executive Leonard Ellerbe confirmed a to-be-determined opponent.

Khan, who impressed on the Mayweather undercard with an excellent win over Luis Collazo, is unable to fight in September because he observes Ramadan.

'Floyd will go on September 13 and we're looking at who he's going to fight and where he is going to fight,' Ellerbe told ESPN.

'Obviously, Las Vegas is his home and the MGM Grand is always the leading candidate but we will take a look at our other options.'

Ellerbe added the undefeated Mayweather has no intention of moving the date to face Khan.

He said: 'If Amir Khan wants to flight Floyd Mayweather, we're going to fight on September 13.'

Time: Khan is worried time is running out on a meeting, but the date won't change to accommodate him

Speaking earlier this month Khan said he was worried that time was 'running out' for a potential bout.

‘I think time might be running out,’ admitted Khan. ‘You always fear a little bit that the fight may not happen, but then I think to myself that at least the world knows I wanted it to happen.

‘It’s a fight I really want and if it never happens I’ll be upset because he is the best out there. If he’s not ready or confident then the fight isn’t going to happen. Even if the world says fight Amir Khan next, if he says ‘no’ then it won’t happen.

‘I really do believe I have the style to beat him. I don’t think he is scared of me but he has said he is scared of getting beaten and I think he sees something in my style which would cause him a lot of problems.'

Potential: Maidana may be in line for a rematch after his showing in the MGM Grand, Las Vegas

Maidana may get a shot at a rematch with Mayweather, with the welterweight champion saying in the aftermath of the win that he would consider fighting him again.

'He's definitely in the mix,' Ellerbe said. 'He's a very dirty fighter. He used a lot of dirty tactics, but Floyd handled him easily and he gave the fans a great fight. But there's a long list of opponents. Everybody wants to be in the Floyd Mayweather sweepstakes. Several guys have made it clear they want to be next.'

Other potential opponents include Danny Garcia, Shawn Porter and Keith Thurman.
