A father-of-two faces losing his leg after breaking it in six places during an horrendous holiday accident on a Turkish waterslide.

Des Jarvis has a bone infection in his right leg and could have to have sections of his lower limb removed after he plummeted through a slide with such force that with sent him crashing into a pool wall opposite. 

The impact broke his leg in six places during the accident last August and he is still on crutches.

He is now threatening to sue tour operators First Choice after he was told that had he sustained such horrific injuries in Britain, it was likely his leg would have been amputated.

The accident left him with horrific open wounds held together by metal plates and screws

The window fitter, 45, was on a £5,500 holiday with his girlfriend Nikki and their children, the Sun reports.

They were staying at the Didim Beach Resort in Altinkum.

He told the paper that he felt like the travel company did not care about the incident, and did not visit him until his third day in hospital. 

He said: 'It’s ruined my life.

'I used to be in the gym every day and play golf twice a week. Now I struggle to get upstairs.'

The accident - which left Mr Jarvis with an open wound, held together by a metal plate- was caught on film.

He has since had two more operations and is seeking compensation from the holiday firm.

A First Choice spokeswoman said it operates the strictest quality standards across all of its hotels.

A spokesman added: 'First Choice is sorry to hear about the injuries sustained by Mr Jarvis, whilst he was holidaying at the Wasd Didim Beach Hotel in Turkey in 2012.

'As the matter in question is currently subject to a legal process, it would be inappropriate of us to comment any further at this time. Our legal team is in direct contact with Mr Jarvis solicitors.

'We would like to reassure customers that incidents of this type are very rare, the health and safety of our customers is of paramount importance to First Choice and we operate the strictest quality standards across all of our hotels.'
