Surviving a day without a smartphone may strike terror into many of us who rely on our gadgets to keep in touch with friends and navigate cities.

Now a survey has revealed that six out of 10 people say they could not go a day without access to the internet, while a similar number could not survive without their mobile phone.

The poll was commissioned by a charity to highlight the difference between ‘essentials’ in the West and those in developing countries, where people cited electricity and irrigation systems among their necessities.

More than a third of people surveyed said they need a morning coffee to get them through the day, according to the survey by fair trade organisation Traidcraft.

And more than two thirds of 16-24 year olds listed their smartphone as their top necessity, as well as half of Londoners, while a quarter of men polled said they couldn’t live without their car.

Half of those surveyed in Scotland chose a hot shower as their daily essential.

The survey coincides with the launch of the charity’s Fair Necessities Appeal which aims to help smallholder farmers in some of the world’s poorest countries escape poverty and build better lives.

Essentials in the UK:

Internet access - 60 per cent of people polled

Smartphone - Two thirds of 16-24 year olds

Coffee - a third of people

A hot shower - Half of Scots

Essentials in Bangladesh:

Electricity

Irrigation systems for farming

Food for the family

Despite producing 70 per cent of the world’s food, farmers who cultivate small plots of land make up half of the planet’s poorest people.

Many of them struggle to afford enough food to eat, basic levels of healthcare for their families, or education for their children.

The charity teaches farmers in Bangladesh, regions of India, and in East Africa more effective cultivation techniques and business skills to help grow more crops and earn more so they can afford the essentials they need.

During a recent trip to Bangladesh, Larry Bush, Marketing Director at Traidcraft, asked farmers about their most important necessities.

‘They listed things like electricity, irrigation systems for the fields, and food on the table.

‘This contrasts greatly with the necessities we in this country consider to be important,’ he said.

The UK government will match every pound raised during the three month appeal through the UK Aid Match scheme.

‘Around 28 million people in Bangladesh live in extreme poverty, unable to access the basic necessities that so many of us take for granted,’ said International Development Secretary, Justine Greening, who is supporting the appeal. ‘Traidcraft's Fair Necessities Appeal will help smallholder farmers around the world support themselves to escape poverty.’

Members of the public can donate to the appeal on Traidcraft’s website, or by texting ‘DOUBLE’ to 70500 from their smartphones to donate £5.
