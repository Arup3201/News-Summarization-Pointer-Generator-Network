With property prices in central London rising one entrepreneur has  converted a former public toilet into a fashionable new bar.

Will Borrell has opened the aptly named 'Ladies and Gentlemen' after an 18 month battle with residents over the abandoned underground restrooms.

The businessman, who owns a Polish vodka company, has even named a cocktail 'Nimby' after the local residents who tried to block the bar in Kentish Town, north west London.

Mr Borrell, the brother of Razorlight star Johnny,  has secured a 15 year lease for the former public toilets and has  restored the building, which features a pre World War Two marble floor and traditional beams.

The toilets and a wall of urinals have also been restored  and a kitchen  added.

'We are signing up to a council scheme that means our toilets will be open to the public,' said Mr Borrell.
