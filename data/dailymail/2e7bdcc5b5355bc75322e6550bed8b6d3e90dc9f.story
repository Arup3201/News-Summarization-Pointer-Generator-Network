Mitt Romney scored an overwhelming win  in Puerto Rico's Republican presidential primary on Sunday.

He trounced chief rival Rick Santorum on the Caribbean island even as the two rivals looked ahead to more competitive contests this week in Illinois and Louisiana.

Romney's wife, Ann, urged Republicans to unite behind her husband. 'It's time to come together,' she said at a rally in suburban Chicago.

'It's time to get behind one candidate and get the job done so we can move on to the next challenge, bringing us one step closer to defeating Barack Obama.'

Late on Sunday night, with 61 per cent of the Puerto Rican votes counted, Romney had 83 per cent of them.

He won all 20 delegates to the 
national convention at stake because he prevailed with more than 50 
percent of the vote. That padded his comfortable lead over Santorum in 
the race to amass the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.

Romney announced the Puerto Rico win 
at the Illinois rally and told the crowd, 'I intend to become our 
nominee and I intend to get Latino voters to vote for a Republican and 
take back the White House.'

The Santorum campaign accused Romney 
of pandering. 'Mitt Romney says he supports English as the official 
language of America while on the mainland, but then says Puerto Ricans 
don't have to learn English while he's on Puerto Rico,' Santorum 
communications director Hogan Gidley said in a press release.

As the day began, Santorum claimed he was in contest for the long haul because Romney is a weak front-runner.

'This is a primary process where 
somebody had a huge advantage, huge money advantage, huge advantage of 
establishment support and he hasn't been able to close the deal and even
come close to closing the deal,' Santorum said. 'That tells you that 
there's a real flaw there.'

Yet Santorum sidestepped when asked if
he would fight Romney on the convention floor if he failed before 
August to stop the former Massachusetts governor from getting the 
required number of delegates.

Romney, in turn, expressed confidence that he'd prevail.

'I can't tell you exactly how the process is going to work,' Romney said. 'But I bet I'm going to become the nominee.'

Both campaigned in Puerto Rico last 
week - in a campaign focused on statehood for the U.S. territory - but 
Romney cut short his trip so he could head to Illinois and Santorum 
spent Sunday in Louisiana.

Illinois, a more moderate Midwestern 
state, votes on Tuesday and is seen as more friendly territory for 
Romney, while Santorum is the favorite in the more conservative Southern
state of Louisiana, which votes on Saturday.

After the Puerto Rico victory, Romney 
had 521 delegates in his camp and Santorum had 253, according to The 
Associated Press's tally. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich trailed 
with 136 delegates and Texas Rep. Ron Paul had 50.

Enrique Melendez, the Republican 
representative on the Puerto Rican State Electoral Commission, told the 
AP that Romney 'won the Puerto Rican primary by a huge margin and we are
granting him the 20 delegates.'

At this rate, Romney is on pace to 
capture the nomination in June unless Santorum or Gingrich is able to 
win decisively in the coming contests.

Both have said they would stay in the 
race and perhaps force the nomination to a fight at the GOP's convention
in Tampa if Romney doesn't amass enough delegates to arrive with a 
mandate. That would turn the convention into an intra-party brawl for 
the first time since 1976.

Even as Santorum declined to commit to
forcing a brokered convention, his advisers were working behind the 
scenes on a plan to persuade convention delegates to switch candidates 
if the former Pennsylvania senator fails to derail Romney before that.

Inevitable? Mitt Romney is seeking to cast his candidacy as unstoppable in an effort to end the race quickly

Romney's aides call this a fantasy scenario even as they try to prevent delegates from defecting.

Half of the states have yet to weigh 
in on a race with seemingly no end in sight anytime soon. That's 
prompted fresh speculation within the GOP over whether a contested 
convention is likely.

Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus insisted that party will have a nominee sooner rather than later.

'We're only at halftime,' Priebus 
said. 'I think that this process is going to play itself out. We will 
have a nominee, I think, fairly soon - one, two months away.'

In Puerto Rico, the race was focused 
on the issue of statehood, and Melendez said, 'This proves Governor 
Romney's electability and his ability to reach out to Hispanics and 
minorities.'

Whether that's true or not, Romney 
told Puerto Ricans he would support statehood while Santorum said 
English would have to be the official language of the island if it were 
to join the United States - a statement that roiled residents.

'In Puerto Rico, we get along fine 
with both languages,' said Francisco Rodriguez, a 76-year-old architect 
who supported Romney and hopes Puerto Rico becomes the nation's 51st 
state.

Even as Puerto Rico voted, Romney and Santorum traded barbs from afar.

'Senator Santorum has the same 
economic lightweight background the president has,' Romney told a crowd 
in Moline, Illinois. He went a step further in Rockford, saying, 'We're 
not going to replace an economic lightweight with another economic 
lightweight.'

That drew a Santorum retort: 'If Mitt Romney's an economic heavyweight, we're in trouble.'

Aside from a pair of TV interviews, 
Santorum spent the day visiting a pair of churches in Louisiana, sharing
how his faith has shaped his political career and his opposition to 
abortion rights and gay marriage. He didn't mention Romney or any of his
other Republican opponents during talks at both churches.

He made clear he didn't plan to exit 
the race anytime soon, saying in Bossier City, Louisiana, 'One of the 
great blessings I've had in every political campaign is people 
underestimate me, people underestimate what God can do.'

But he was curt when asked about his 
odds in Illinois. 'Keep working,' Santorum said after services there. 
'That's all we can do.'
