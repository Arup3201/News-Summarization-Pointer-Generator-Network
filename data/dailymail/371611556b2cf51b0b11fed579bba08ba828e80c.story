Aston Villa forward Gabby Agbonlahor is poised to hand manager Paul Lambert a major boost by penning a new long-term deal.

The forward has been an integral member of Lambert’s team and the Scot has been keen to secure his future.

The forward has been locked in negotiations over fresh terms for several weeks and has now virtually agreed what is understood to be a new four-year deal.
