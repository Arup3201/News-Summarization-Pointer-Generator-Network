The Internal Revenue Service has today awarded a jailed tax cheat whistleblower and former UBS AG bank employee Bradley Birkenfeld $104 million for handing over insider information into the Swiss bank's promotion of secret offshore accounts to U.S. taxpayers.

Lawyers for the Boston-born banker said that they believed that the sum is the largest reward ever handed to one whistleblower in the U.S. and the IRS confirmed that amount had been given to Mr. Birkenfeld, but refused to say whether it was the largest award to date.

The money was awarded to Mr. Birkenfeld after he told U.S. authorities about illicit banking practices that were encouraged by the Swiss banking giant that led to UBS paying $780 million in fines and agreeing to hand over information on more than 4,000 Swiss bank account holders to avoid a criminal case.

$104 million man: Bradley Birkenfeld talks to the press before surrendering to authorities at the Schuylkill County Federal Correctional Institution in Minersville, Pennsylvania in January 2010

The 47-year-old former banker wasn't at the press conference held by his attorney's. He has only been recently released after serving part of a 40-month sentence after pleading guilty to withholding information about his own role in the Swiss bank scheme, specifically his relationship with a California property developer.

Mr. Birkenfeld took advantage of a 2006 law passed by Congress that awards whistleblowers up to 30 percent of the revenue they help to recover with the information that they supply to the IRS.

The 2006 law sponsored by Republican Senator, Charles Grassley targets high-income tax dodgers, guaranteeing rewards for qualified whistleblowers if the company in question owes at least $2 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties.

The $104 million that has been handed to Mr. Birkenfeld is taxable experts said to the Wall Street Journal and speculated that the attorney's fees could range from 15 percent to 35 percent of the pretax award.

'The IRS today sent 104 million messages to whistleblowers around the world — that there is now a safe and secure way to report tax fraud and that the IRS is now paying awards,' Birkenfeld's lawyers, Stephen M. Kohn and Dean A. Zerbe, said in a statement. 'The IRS also sent 104 million messages to banks around the world — stop enabling tax cheats or you will get caught.'

The IRS, which doesn't usually confirm individual award payments, said Birkenfeld signed a disclosure waiver, allowing the agency to confirm his award.

'The IRS believes that the whistleblower statute provides a valuable tool to combat tax non-compliance, and this award reflects our commitment to the law,' IRS spokeswoman Michele Eldridge said in an email.

Birkenfeld has become something of a cause-celebre among whistleblowers because of the magnitude of his case and the fact that he was jailed after cooperating with authorities.

In a summary of the award provided by Birkenfeld's lawyers, the IRS said, 'The comprehensive information provided by the whistleblower was exceptional in both its breadth and depth.'

'While the IRS was aware of tax compliance issues related to secret bank accounts in Switzerland and elsewhere, the information provided by the whistleblower formed the basis for unprecedented actions against UBS AG, with collateral impact on other enforcement activities and a continuing impact on future compliance by UBS AG,' the IRS said in the summary.

Federal prosecutors, however, had said Birkenfeld withheld information about his own dealings with a former UBS client who pleaded guilty in 2007 to tax charges.

In a case that shook Swiss banking to its core, UBS in 2009 entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and paid $780 million in fines, penalties, interest and restitution to settle charges that it helped 17,000 U.S. clients hide $20 billion. U.S. authorities are still investigating other Swiss banks.

As the U.S. government struggles with a massive budget deficit, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said as a result of the information provided by Birkenfeld, 'billions of dollars in taxes owed will be collected that otherwise would not have been paid.'

A typical Swiss bank account is traditionally one of the most secretive options for storing money and of avoiding tax

Grassley has in the past criticized the IRS whistleblower program, which gathers information from people who want to alert the tax-collecting agency to misconduct. Grassley, a Republican, wrote a bill in 2006 that overhauled the program.

Last year, the whistleblower program collected only $48 million in tax revenues, down from $464 million in fiscal 2010. New whistleblower cases were down, as well, with some lawyers complaining that the program office was slow and uncooperative with whistleblowers.

Grassley said the case showed the whistleblower program can be effective, but he criticized the IRS for taking nearly four years to settle with Birkenfeld.

'If the IRS is serious about encouraging future whistleblowers, it needs to continue to honor the spirit and intent of the law and issue awards in a timely manner.'

The sum paid by the IRS to Birkenfeld is 'the largest whistleblower reward issued to a single individual,' said Stephen Kohn, one of the former banker's lawyers.

Dean Zerbe, another Birkenfeld attorney, said his client's actions have brought in $5 billion in taxes from 'big banks and wealthy individuals who tried to evade paying their fair share.'

The U.S. crackdown on Americans dodging taxes in Switzerland has spawned a diplomatic showdown between the two countries. In 2010, UBS agreed to disclose 4,450 American client names.

Eleven Swiss banks are known still to be under investigation by the United States and the Swiss have been seeking a legal deal to remove the taint from their financial industry.

The Birkenfeld case could prompt a backlash from the financial industry and its U.S. allies, said Solomon Wisenberg, a partner at law firm Barnes & Thornburg.

'The response could be for the friends of big business in Congress to argue this is an outrage that someone involved in this could get this kind of award,' he said.

'But if ever there was anyone who deserved a big reward it was this guy. He's done something no one's ever done before, essentially brought the Swiss banks to their knees,' said Wisenberg.
