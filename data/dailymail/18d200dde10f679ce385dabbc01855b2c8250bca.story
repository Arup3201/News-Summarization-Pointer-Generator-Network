Violent biker gangs from Australia, Canada and the US have arrived in Europe prompting fears of a battle for organised crime markets throughout the continent.

Britain has been warned that turf wars could break out as 'Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs' fight for control over the drugs, weapons and human trafficking criminal markets.

The European Union's law enforcement agency has now warned of a repeat of the 1990s biker wars that left at least 11 dead.

Warning: Hells Angels are among the biker gangs that are expanding, according to Europol

Europol said the arrival of notorious gangs including Comancheros and Rebels from Australia, Rock Machine from Canada and Mongols and Vagos from the US has exacerbated tensions with established clubs.

It has informed police forces across the continent that established gangs are expandings and said there are already ongoing territorial battles with organised crime groups.

Football hooligans from Britain and the continent, as well as former military personnel, right-wing extremists and prison gangs are among those expected to be targeted for recruitment.

Europol said the four main groups - Outlaws, Hells Angels, Bandidos and Gremium MC - were all increasing their membership, particularly in north east and south east Europe.

It has warned that gang members are known to use 'extreme forms of violence' including automatic rifles such as Kalashnikovs and grenades 'indiscriminately'.

Europol said the number of biker gang chapters in Europe has increased significantly since 2010 and there are now more than 700 chapters across the continent.

Experts fear the new wave could lead to a repeat of the Nordic Biker Wars in the 1990s.

Eleven people were killed and dozens more injured during a three year battle between the Hells Angels and Bandidos in Scandinavia that involved the use of car bombs and machine guns.

Biker gang violence has also been seen in Britain more recently.

In 2008 seven members of the South Warwickshire Outlaws were jailed for the murder of Hell's Angel Gerry Tobin, who was shot as he rode his Harley Davidson on the M40 after leaving a biker festival.

A Europol spokesperson said: 'The main threat to public safety associated with OMCGs stems from their propensity to use extreme forms of violence... and the indiscriminate nature with which this violence is often used in open conflicts between rival groups.'

The spokesperson added: 'Merely establishing a chapter on the ‘turf’ of another OMCG is interpreted as an act of provocation and is likely to result in violent confrontations and retaliation.

'Given the significant expansion of OMCGs and charters in Europe, Europol has informed its law enforcement partners that dedicated monitoring and analysis is needed because of the risk of clashes and the possible impact on the general organised crime situation.'
