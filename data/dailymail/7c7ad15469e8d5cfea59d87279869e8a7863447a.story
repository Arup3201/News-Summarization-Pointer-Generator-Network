While Kristen Stewart and her married
 director paramour Rupert Sanders have both issued grovelling apologies 
for their exposed affair, Robert Pattinson has remained resolutely silent.

Still, his actions speak volumes.

The 26-year-old has packed his bags and left the LA love nest he shared with Kristen Stewart, according to reputable American magazine People.

The 'heartbroken and angry' British actor has gone to ground and sources tell the publication he is not in contact with his partner of three years.

The insider adds: 'I'm not sure they'll be able to recover from this.'

It's unclear exactly when Robert 
found out about the 22-year-old's affair with Snow White and the 
Huntsman director, who has two children with British model Liberty Ross.

Kristen and Rupert were photographed in the throes of passion on July 17 but the images did not surface in the media until two days ago.

She was pictured with Robert on July 19 at The Hotel Cafe in Hollywood and onlookers said they were 'kissing and laughing.'

They also attended the Teen Choice Awards together on July 22 looking like a decidedly happy couple.

But fellow attendees back stage at the ceremony detected some tension between them away from cameras, with a source telling the New York Post: 'Rob and Kristen were having a long and intense conversation backstage, and he looked miserable, heartbroken and humiliated. She was pleading.'

The actor made his feelings regarding
 infidelity clear in April, telling Vanity Fair: 'There's a thing I've 
never got: That is, why do people cheat?'

He explained that while he 'can 
understand the impulse' to cheat, he doesn't comprehend 'how you can 
keep two relationships going at the same time for long.'

'I'm not the casual-affair kind of 
guy,' he said. 'If I choose to be with someone, it's because I really 
want it. When I have a relationship, I'm 100 percent into it.'

Kristen said in her apology statement: 'I love [Rob], I’m so sorry.'

The star has not emerged since details of the dalliance hit the press.

Us Weekly detailed the liaison, with a source saying Rupert was 'all over' Kristen.

Another source added they 'would only take a 
break [from kissing] when they thought someone was walking by.'

Taking direction: Kristen and Rupert seen chatting in between takes on the set of Snow White And The Huntsman

A photographer followed Kristen from her Los Feliz home and
 when the actress pulled into the parking lot of a deserted building and
 Rupert got into her car.

The source explained: 'It seemed like they couldn't get enough. Kristen 
was sitting up with her back against the driver's-side window, and this 
guy was kissing her entire body.'

The pair left when they thought they were being watched and drove to an 
area near the Hollywood sign and Kristen appeared 'swept up in the 
moment' as they kissed and cuddled outside the car.

While the area they were in was quite deserted, they were disturbed by 
some dog walkers and each time 'as soon as they heard a voice, they 
would split up and walk in opposite directions'.

Meanwhile,
 the young heartthrobs new movie The Rover has been given the green 
light by Screen Australia, according to The Hollywood Reporter!

Set
 in the Australian desert, The Rover is a futuristic western that 'tells
 the story of Eric (Guy Pearce), who has left everything, everyone and 
every semblance of human kindness behind him, as he’s forced to join an 
injured gang member, Rey (Pattinson), to hunt down Rey’s gang after they
 steal the last of Eric’s possessions.'
