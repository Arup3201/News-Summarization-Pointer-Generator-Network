A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found inside a suitcase at a sports ground in London yesterday.

The suitcase was discovered hidden among the trees surrounding the field by Thornfield Avenue, Mill Hill, north London, at around 5pm yesterday.

Police were called to the scene and the area has been cordoned off.

Detectives from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command are now investigating.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said a post-mortem examination will be arranged in due course.

The woman, who has been described as a young adult, has not yet been identified.

A police helicopter hovered overhead this afternoon as detectives combed the scene for clues. No arrests have been made. 

Murder Squad DCI Nicola Wall, speaking by the crime scene, said: 'We have worked throughout the night and we are working as hard as we can to find out who is in that suitcase and how they came to be there.

'We are in the early stages. There is a family out there and I don't want to give the wrong information and unnecessarily worry them.'

Local residents said police arrived at the scene shortly after 5pm and sealed off the area around a footbridge which crosses a brook at the back of a row of 1930s suburban houses.

But some told how they believe the body may have been there since Saturday.

Diving instructor Richard Heraty, 44, walked alongside the brook with his two children, three and six, when he noticed what looked like clothing, or a blue tarpulin against a fence on Saturday afternoon.

He said: 'It looked weird. It looked like clothing in the wooded area. It did not look too good. It's usually pretty tidy in there. I thought it might of been rubbish left by drinkers.

'It looked like either clothes, a blue tarpaulin, or someone someone sleeping rough.

'I had my three-year-old and six-year-old on their bikes and was watching to make sure they didn't fall in the stream so I didn't look too closely.'

Mr Heraty has lived in the area for 15 years and came forward after hearing on the news about the gruesome discovery.

He added: 'It's quite disturbing. If someone has dumped something they have gone out of their way to dump it here. There are lots of dog walkers all day long. Its a lovely walk.'

Resident Donna Pickup, 42, spoke of her shock as she and her family had walked through the strip of woods just an hour before the body was discovered.

She said: 'It's awful. We saw police with sniffer dogs and quite a lot of police. It was all open when we walked through about 4pm. By five it was all closed off.

'We could have walked past the poor woman without realising she was there. It's a big shock. There are lots of children and dog walkers who use the park.

'You don't expect this sort of thing to happen quite where you live.'

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I live across the road from the brook and footbridge. At about 5.30pm the police came and sealed off the area. They cordoned off the footbridge and then began searching along beside the brook.

'I asked one of the policemen what had happened and all he would tell me is that it was a crime scene and we wouldn't be allowed to go down there.

'I later found out that they had found the body of a woman.

'It must have been brought from somewhere else because this is a very quiet area. We get some kids down by the footbridge but they are not really any trouble - it must have been somebody else who brought it and dumped it.'

Local residents believe the body may have been left in the woods since Saturday after walkers spotted what appeared to be clothing strewn about the area
