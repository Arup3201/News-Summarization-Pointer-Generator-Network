Gary Lineker and Jamie Carragher were involved in a lively Twitter debate on Tuesday night regarding John Stones' display against West Ham.

Match of the Day presenter Lineker praised the Everton defender for dribbling the ball out from the back.

But former Liverpool centre back Carragher disagreed with Lineker and insisted Stones' decision was 'stupid' as his error almost led to a goal at Upton Park.

Lineker kicked off the discussion by tweeting to his 3.49million followers: 'I know he cocked up, but I like that John Stones was brave enough to attempt to dribble out from the back. Wonderfully un English. #WHUEVE.'

To which Carragher replied just four minutes later: 'It wasn't brave it was stupid! Had 3 men to beat on the edge of his own box!! Although a man in the world 11 would have as well.'

Former Leicester and Tottenham striker Lineker believes young English players should be applauded for trying to take the game to the opposition, however Carragher again stated there is a time and place for such tactics.

Lineker said to Carragher: 'Thought you might disagree with that one. He'll learn when to do it, but so many English defenders lack the balls to try and play.'

Sky Sports pundit Carragher responded: 'I agree, he shows for the ball is willing to step in to midfield as well. But taking on 3 men on the edge of the box is madness,' to which Lineker replied: ' I like madness, but then I was a striker!'

The conversation came to an end when Carragher concluded: 'As a striker you'd love a defender dribbling out! Would imagine it was Sharp doing the tackling though!!'

We take it Carragher was referring to Lineker's former Everton team-mate, Scottish striker Graeme Sharp. 

West Ham managed to progress to the fourth round of the FA Cup by defeating Everton on penalties.

Spanish goalkeeper Adrian scored the winning kick to book a date with Bristol City in the next round of the competition.
