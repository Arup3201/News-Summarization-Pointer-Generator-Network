They believe it contains a garage for UFOs and is the only place safe from the end of the world on Friday.

But now Doomsday followers have been blocked from reaching their 'mystical mountain' in the tiny French village of Bugarach.

Thousands of devotees have flocked to Bugarach praying that aliens will rescue them when the apocalypse comes.

The picturesque village of Bugarach has become a focal point for fanatics who think it is the only place safe from the end of the world on Friday

Vigilant: French Gendarmes patrol the village and mountain area which has been blocked off to Doomsday believers

Mayor Jean-Pierre Delord has called in the police to protect Bugarach from the thousands of believers it is feared will descend on the village

But Mayor Jean-Pierre
Delord fears the sleepy village, which has a population of just 189, 
will be overrun with New Age fanatics who think aliens will whisk them 
to safety 'in another dimension' while the rest of the planet perishes.

Today, he appealed to believers to 
stay away and has called in the police to protect the village until two 
days after the predicted end of the world.

He said: 'I am making an appeal to the world - do not come to Bugarach.

'This is no laughing matter. If 10,000 people turn up on December 21, our village will not be able to cope.'

After one hippie died climbing the mountain earlier this year, Mr Delord quipped to the French media: 'The end of the world came a bit earlier for him than he expected.'

Police and troops have now set up road blocks to stop hippies scaling the summit - and declared the zone a no-go area for five days from December 19.

Regional prefect Eric Freysselinard said: 'I have issued an order barring anyone from climbing the mountain.

'And those trying to get into the village will be stopped and asked what their business is.'

He added: 'Bugarach and the mountain will then remain closed off until two days after the world is supposed to end.'

The normally peaceful village will be closed off until two days after the world is supposed to end

But hippies flooding into Bugarach are convinced the area has been selected by aliens as the only place to survive in the run up to Doomsday - when the Mayan calendar's 5,125-year cycle finishes.

Earlier this year, France's Mission for the Fight against Sects also placed Bugarach under scrutiny due to concerns over possible mass suicides.

And it warned people in a report not to be taken in by 'New Age clap-trap' being peddled by cult leaders.

Their report also stressed that December 21, 2012, would be the 183rd time the world had been predicted to end in the last 2,000 years.

The last time the world was due to end was May 21, 2011, according to a prediction by US-based cult Rapture.

Its leader Harold Camping said after the apocolyse failed to happen that he was 'flabbergasted' that the world was still there.
