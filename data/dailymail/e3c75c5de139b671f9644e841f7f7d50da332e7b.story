Rory McIlroy took a giant leap towards dominating the golfing world by winning the Australian Open last year, so it was fitting that he posed with a baby kangaroo on his return to Sydney on Tuesday.

McIlroy endured a dismal year for most of 2013 but is back Down Under looking to defend the title which kick-started his stunning resurgence - the Northern Irishman claimed two majors this year, starred at the Ryder Cup and is the undisputed world No 1.

'Great to be back defending the Australian Open and the Australian Golf Club is looking amazing,' said McIlroy on Twitter as he posed for a picture with a Joey in Sydney Harbour. 'Bring it on!'

If McIlroy performs as well this week as he did in beating home favourite Adam Scott to the title 12 months ago, he'll even have the Aussie galleries jumping for joy.

Given McIlroy's brilliant performances this year, which brought major victories in The Open and US PGA Championship plus two other wins, it is hard to believe just how bad 2013 was in comparison.

McIlroy struggled to adapt to his new equipment, fell out with his management company and walked off the course during his defence of the Honda Classic, not to mention labelling his own play 'brain dead' when missing the cut in the Open at Muirfield.

The 25-year-old had to wait until December to win his first tournament of 2013 at Royal Sydney, denying Scott the triple crown after the Masters champion had won the Australian PGA and Australian Masters.

Twelve months on McIlroy returns to Sydney - albeit a different golf course - already thinking about completing a career grand slam in the Masters next April and brimming with confidence.

'This year has been full of ups and downs, mainly ups, which is a great thing,' said McIlroy, who won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in May just days after calling off his wedding to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki.

'I learned a lot from it and I feel like I came through this year stronger and wiser, and I can go into 2015 in a much better place. I'm happy with the success that I've had and I feel like there's been a lot that I've learned this year, as well, and that's a great thing going into the future.

'This week's a big week. I want to go down there and play well and do a good job with defending my title. After that I've got a pretty busy week. I'm not playing golf but I've got a few other commitments and things to do.

Victory at the Australian Open last year was the springboard to success in 2014 for McIlroy

'But I'll have a little bit of downtime over Christmas and New Year, which will be nice. I'll start practising again early on in the new year and getting ready for Abu Dhabi.'

McIlroy has now spent a total of 56 weeks as world No 1 during his career and feels he has finally come to grips with the responsibility which accompanies such a lofty position.

'I used to be uncomfortable,' added McIlroy, who is in his fifth spell at the top of the rankings. 'You get to the point where there's added scrutiny and there's added criticism or whatever it is.

'But I learned to deal with it. It's just part of the title now, world No 1. That's what it comes with. I've become comfortable with it.

'I've spent more than a year of my career at world No 1, so if I'm not used to it by now, then there's something wrong. I obviously enjoy it. It's where I want to be. I want to be the best player in the world and I want to keep it for as long as I possibly can.'
