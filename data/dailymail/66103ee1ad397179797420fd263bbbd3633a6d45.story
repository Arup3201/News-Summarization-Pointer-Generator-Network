Members of the England football team who struggled to unwind after their game against Poland was delayed by 20 hours were given sleeping tablets, it has emerged.

The decision is likely to raise questions after the team managed only a 1-1 draw - losing out on two vital World Cup points - in a lacklustre performance when the game finally went ahead at Warsaw's National Stadium last night.

The England players, some of whom routinely take caffeine stimulant tablets before matches, had been all set to take on the Polish team on Tuesday night, but the game was postponed at the last minute because of a waterlogged pitch.

Many players struggled to unwind after being poised to take to the pitch, and those worst-affected were given sleeping tablets.

When the match went ahead last night Wayne Rooney scored to give his team a first-half lead, but Poland's Kamil Glik equalised 20 minutes from time to bring the score level.

The disappointing result raised questions over the impact taking sleeping pills can have on a player's performance.

But goalkeeper Joe Hart was quick to take the blame for the scoreline, while defender Rio Ferdinand took to Twitter to rubbish suggestions sleeping tablets had anything to do with Wednesday's result, posting 'What's all the fuss with caffeine/sleeping tablets?? Players have used them for yrs before + after games without any fuss...'

Hart shouldered responsibility for Poland’s goal after coming out to punch a corner, only to be beaten to the ball by centre half Glik.

‘I came out and didn’t get there,’ said Hart. ‘It’s my fault and that’s cost us the three points.'

Poland mastered the sodden pitch better than the English players, who looked to have suffered more from the disruption of the game being put back because of a waterlogged pitch.

Thousands of football fans who had travelled to eastern Europe for the game were left infuriated after officials ignored weather forecasts and chose not to close the £400million stadium's retractable roof.

Heavy rain had been falling in the Polish capital for most of the day, but the roof stayed open and - after 45 minutes of deliberation - the game was called off.

The key World Cup qualifying tie eventually went ahead last night, but players and fans will have been disappointed with the result.

Manager Hodgson said: ‘I had the impression 
earlier in the week that the players were looking sharp and lively. I 
didn’t have that impression today. I don’t know if that’s due to the 
extra night, the sodden pitch or that we didn’t play well on the day.

‘There are days when you don’t hit the heights. You just have to make certain you don’t go away ruing that fact. A point in Warsaw is not to be looked down upon.’

Hodgson took his team for a walk and a stretch on Wednesday morning and no-one tried to use the delay as an excuse.

Captain Steven Gerrard questioned why the roof of the stadium in Poland wasn't closed due to the weather ahead of the scheduled match on Tuesday, but added that the players were 'at the top level' and couldn't use the delay as an excuse.

'When you’re fired up, pumped up and you’ve had your massages and you’re ready to go and then don’t play, that’s not ideal,' he said.

'But we’re professionals. We’re playing at the top level and we had to get ourselves up for this but I didn’t think we were totally at the races.

‘The pitch was slippy, wet and cutting
up. I think it was laid a week-and-a-half ago. So it wasn’t ideal. Both
teams tried to make the most of it and they did it better.

‘The surprise was why they didn’t shut the roof the night before when it was raining. But that’s life. We get on with it. I won’t use the delay and conditions as an excuse. The reason we didn’t win was because we didn’t pass it when we went in front.’

The draw means England will be overtaken as group leaders if Montenegro beat San Marino next month and manager Hodgson is looking for a big improvement when his side travel to San Marino and Montenegro in March.

He said: ‘We didn’t play well. We’ve got to be satisfied we came away with a point. We were fortunate to be 1-0 up at half-time because we hadn’t played well.

‘The extra day and stay over, the sogginess of the pitch didn’t work in our favour. But we leave here with a point, on an unbeaten run, and hopefully we’ll continue to progress and get the points  we need.’
