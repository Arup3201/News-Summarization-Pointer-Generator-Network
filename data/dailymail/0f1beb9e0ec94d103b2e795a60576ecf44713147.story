Slavisa Jokanovic  rounded off his Chelsea career with an abandoned FA Cup party and returns as the manager of Watford with the aim of wrecking another Chelsea celebration before it has even started.

The Serb, the first signing made by Claudio Ranieri in 2000, was part of the squad that reached the 2002 FA Cup final but never got off the bench as the Blues lost 2-0 to Arsenal.

‘The FA Cup final really was one of the most important days in my whole career,’ he said. 

Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic is looking forward to facing his former side on Sunday

Jokanovic, pictured with Tim Sherwood, plied his trade at Chelsea for two years between 2000 and 2002

‘I remember we had some celebrations planned because we arrived at this game with intentions and belief to beat Arsenal. We had plans but Arsenal broke us that day. I was very, very disappointed.’

His time at Chelsea ended when his contract lapsed two months later before Jokanovic went on a managerial odyssey taking in five clubs in five countries before this one.

He said: ‘It is probably true that if I hadn’t played for Chelsea then I might not be manager of Watford now. I am very happy to have another chance to be in that stadium again.’

Jokanovic became Claudio Ranieri's first signing at Chelsea when he moved from Deportivo La Coruna
