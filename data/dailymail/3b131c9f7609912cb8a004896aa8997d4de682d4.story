New York mayor Bill de Blasio has laid a wreath at the site of the Paris kosher store terror attack and vowed to stand in solidarity with France against 'terrorism and anti-semitism'.

The mayor today visited the Hyper Cacher supermarket - alongside members of the local Jewish community -  as part of a brief overnight visit to the French capital.

Hostages Yohan Cohen, Yoav Hattab, Francois-Michel Saada and Phillipe Braham were murdered at the kosher bakery by gunman Amedy Coulibaly, who was subsequently shot dead by police  on January 9.

The mayor's office released a statement during his visit in which he promised to support France.

It read: 'The mayor will stand in solidarity with our friends in Paris and across France to send the clear message that together we will fight terrorism and anti-semitism at every turn, and that crude attempts to intimidate free expression will not succeed.'

His trip also includes a meeting with Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, a wreath-laying at the Charlie Hebdo offices, and a visit to the spot where police officer Ahmed Merbat was shot and killed.

The visit by the mayor comes just days after US Secretary of State John Kerry's belated trip to France in the wake of the terror sieges.

After a wave of domestic criticism that the US had not sent adequate representation to France in the wake of the attacks,  Kerry arrived late last week to undertake what turned out to be an awkward show of contrition.

De Blasio, meanwhile, remains under pressure at home with tensions between City Hall and New York police officers at their highest in decades.

The head of the NYPD's largest police union has said de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' for the deaths of Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, after they were gunned down by a madman who was upset about alleged police brutality cases.
