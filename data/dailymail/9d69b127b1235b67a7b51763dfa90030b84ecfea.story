Chelsea battled their way to the Capital One Cup final with a hard-fought 1-0 extra-time win ensuring a 2-1 aggregate victory against Liverpool.

Branislav Ivanovic's header in the opening period of added time was enough for Jose Mourinho's men, who will face either Tottenham or Sheffield United at Wembley.

Here, Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown rates each player.

CHELSEA (TEAM AVERAGE 6.6)

Thibaut Courtois - 7.5

Made some good saves in the first half. He can pluck the ball out of the air at will.

Branislav Ivanovic - 6

Awkward without an opponent opposite him and was outmuscled. 

John Terry - 6.5

A difficult task against Sterling but kept things simple and passed the ball well. 

Kurt Zouma - 6

Sometimes took too long on the ball but recovered well to deny Sterling in the first half 

Branislav Ivanovic rises highest to score the decisive goal and send Chelsea to Wembley

Filipe Luis - 6

Luis In what was a full on game, the Brazilian was quiet but he did his job. 

Nemanja Matic - 6

Not as assured as normal. Liverpool’s pressing forced him into some rare mistakes. 

Cesc Fabregas - 6

Had to work harder defensively than he might have liked and struggled in attack.

Eden Hazard - 8

The harder you press him, the faster he goes. As good as any winger in world football.

Willian - 7

Buzzed around with plenty of energy and an important ingredient in the win.

Oscar - 6.5

Disappointing after a good spell. The least effective of Chelsea’s front men.

Diego Costa - 7.5

The ultimate warrior but he may have crossed the line on this occasion.

MANAGER

Jose Mourinho – 7

Disappointing to see him calling for players to be sent off but he manages on the edge.

Chelsea striker Diego Costa had an eventful night against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge

SUBSTITUTES

Ramires (for Fabregas 50, 6.5), Azpilicueta (for Luis 78, 6)

Not used: Cech, Cahill, Ake, Remy, Drogba.

LIVERPOOL (TEAM AVERAGE 6.9)

Simon Mignolet - 7.5

Hugely improved and dealt well with everything. Made two fine second-half saves.

Emre Can - 6

The German had a difficult start but grew another lung in extra-time.

Martin Skrtel - 7

Showed fighting spirit and is the man of the team, but lucky not to concede a penalty.

Mamadou Sakho - 6.5

Understands his role in the back three and was solid, but hit a poor second-half pass.

Lazar Markovic - 6

Used his pace well and put in the hard miles for his team before coming off. 

Steven Gerrard - 6

Not quite at his best in fiery game. Only one chance left for a Wembley final.

Lucas Leiva - 7.5

A vital part of the defensive screen and pinched the ball intelligently.

Jordan Henderson - 7

Passed well and fought hard in a busy midfield but will rue a late missed chance.

Philippe Coutinho (right) was the star man on the night despite Liverpool's extra-time defeat

Alberto Moreno - 7

Was impressive on the flank and used his pace well to give Ivanovic problems.

Philippe Coutinho - 8 (STAR MAN)

His closing down and running with the ball was of the highest quality.

Raheem Sterling - 7.5

Dangerous in a central role and tested the Chelsea defence but unable to break through.

Raheem Sterling was once again asked to play as a lone striker by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers

MANAGER

Brendan Rodgers – 7

Set his team up to attack well. This was more like the Liverpool of last season.

SUBSTITUTES

Johnson (for Sakho 57, 6), Balotelli (for Markovic 70, 6)

Not used: Ward, Lovren, Lambert, Lallana, Allen.
