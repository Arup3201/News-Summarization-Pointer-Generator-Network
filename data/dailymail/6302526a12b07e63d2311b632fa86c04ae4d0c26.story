Art often confronts questions of life, death and the human condition.

Now one introspective painter has delved even further into existential themes.

He creates each of his works entirely from his own blood.

Vincent Castiglia, from New York, insists that the content of his work - surrealistic human bodies in various stages of decay - overshadows the strange medium.

The tattooed 30-year-old describes his figures as being painted with 'what could be described as "liquid flesh"'.

He says that the iron oxide in human blood is a pigment common in paint, and also found naturally in rust and iron ore.

His first experiments with using his blood as paint were prompted by a 'need to connect with his work on the most intimate level', but he insists the methods are not gimmicky.

'My response would be to really take a 
look at the content of the work, which overshadows what it's made from, I
 think,' he said.

'In order for something to be a gimmick, it really 
would have to lack substance.'

Castiglia's website says he 'practises a kind of modern-day phlebotomy [blood-letting]... siphoning the life force which contains his own psychic energy, while giving it an outlet and form [and dissolving] the barrier between artist and art.'

He sketches out his pieces in graphite or pen, before extracting his blood in the studio and completing his scarlet artworks.

The larger, more detailed 
paintings can take more than three months to complete all the works cost between $950 and $26,000. Rock and blues musician Gregg 
Allman recently acquired a 2006 painting by Castiglia called Gravity.

Castiglia's latest exhibition, Resurrection, consists of a collection of his blood paintings from the last 10 years, and runs throughout October in Soho, Manhattan.

One of the pieces, Feeding, depicts a mother with decaying legs in a wheelchair gazing at an infant she is breastfeeding. Castiglia describes it as an expression of the fragility of life and the hope and drive that can still accompany it.

His art may be familiar to slasher film 
and heavy metal fans. In 2010, one of his works was used as the
 poster for MTV horror film Savage County, and other paintings were used 
as album art for Swiss heavy metal band Triptykon's debut Eparistera 
Daimones in the same year.

Castiglia's work has also featured on Spike TV and tattoo parlour reality show Miami Ink.
