David Cameron distanced himself when he met for talks with former Prime Minister Tony Blair during the second day of his visit to Israel and the West Bank, saying he never said he wanted to be 'heir to Blair'.

Cameron met Blair in East Jerusalem to be briefed on the Palestinian economy and the state of Middle Eastern peace talks prior to his meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

Blair met with the PM as peace envoy for a group called 'the Quartet' (the UN, US, EU and
 Russia) his role being promotion economic growth and job creation in the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip.

While Cameron said he was taking the advice of Tony Blair in regards to the peace talks and economics in the Middle East, he denied that the relationship between them was turning into a friendship

Mr Cameron said of the meeting: 'We come from different political parties, different political traditions
 and there are many things we disagreed about.

'But we both want a 
two-state solution and he has got a contribution to help bring that 
about by helping generate Palestinian economic growth.'

When
 questioned about his relationship with his predecessor, he said: 'I 
obviously listen to Tony Blair's advice, as I listen to many people's 
advice.

'I wouldn't say it is about friendship.

'We were very vigorous opponents.

'I remember facing him across the dispatch box every Wednesday at prime minister's questions.'

Because of the peace process in the 
middle east, Blair, in his duties of economic planning, is constantly 
facing issues to do with peace talks, as they are vital to boosting the 
economy in the area.

The 
meeting with Blair lasted around 20 minutes, and during the talks the 
pair discussed Mr Blair's Palestinian economic initiatives.

Following the meeting, Blair said: 'The British Government has actually got a great opportunity here, 
because it is relatively trusted by both sides, which is quite rare in 
this situation.

'I think we have got the right idea on relationships between a political 
negotiation to resolve all the difficult issues about borders and 
security and Jerusalem and so on, and the economic side, which is 
absolutely vital because if we don't build the Palestinian economy up at
 the same time as you are pursuing the political negotiation then a 
state for the Palestinians seems a dream and not a reality.'

Cameron has promised £1.5 million in grants to help Palestinian companies with foreign investment.

He
 also wants to see more training for the 1,000 female refugees in Gaza, 
to create new jobs and industries that would lead to benefits to Israel.

Despite the rocket attacks on Israel by Iranian-backed militants in Gaza the day before, Cameron held a video-chat with Palestinian youths to discuss humanitarian issues.

He also held a meeting with eight Palestinian businesspeople from East Jerusalem and claimed that he hoped one day East Jerusalem would be a Palestinian state capital, re-emphasising his support for the states of Israel and Palestine to come together in peace.

In addition to the meeting with Blair,
 Mr Cameron took time out from his day's scheduled discussions to visit 
the site considered to be the birthplace of Jesus Christ.

At
 the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the Prime Minister visited a grotto traditionally identified as the
 location of Christ's manger. 

Cameron met with both members of the Armenian church, and the Catholic Church of St Catherine

Cameron's visit is to last two days, and it is the first time he has visited the area since he was the leader of the opposition four years ago

After entering the church through a low stone doorway known as the 'door of humility', Cameron 
spoke with the leaders from the Greek Orthodox Church.

The church is dimly lit by ornate golden lamps, and has rain dripping through the ceiling, which is currently under repair.

After visiting the birthplace, the 
PM was introduced to members of the Armenian church, then went on the 
adjoining Catholic Church of St Catherine, where he lit a candle.

He 
later went to St Jerome's cave, where King Herod is said to have 
buried children killed during his effort to eliminate the heralded King 
of the Jews.

David Cameron spoke during a joint news conference with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. He held separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abbas, who are at odds over U.S. proposals to keep peace talks going beyond an April target date for an agreement

Both Blair and Cameron believe that the UK is in a unique position, as it is able to appeal to both sides of the Israel - Palestine conflict

He also met with Mayor of Bethlehem, Vera Baboun, and took a tour of the city after his visits to the various holy sites, as well as meeting with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas at the residence of the Palestinian Authority in Bethlehem.

Shortly after, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to visit the Teva pharmaceutical plant as part of his official scheduled meetings with the leaders of the states.

Mr Cameron last visited Israel as leader of the opposition in 2009.
