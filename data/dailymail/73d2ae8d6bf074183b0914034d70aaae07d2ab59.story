Police are hunting for an armed robber who raided a New Hampshire Dunkin' Donuts store on Tuesday night wearing a President Obama mask.

CCTV footage shows the disguised male suspect walking into the eatery on Lowell Road, Salem, just after 8pm, brandishing a small black hand gun.

After being handed a wad of cash by the server, the man turns around and exits.

A manager at the store told WMUR News that the robber instructed the clerk to 'hurry up.'

Police were called to the store at 8.10pm. They say the man fled the scene of the crime in a dark green Toyota which had no rear licence plate.

Investigators are currently contacting stores in the area that sell similar masks to help identify the thief.

Deputy chief Shawn Patten of the Salem Police Department said that ski masks are commonly worn in armed robberies and 'it's not often we see a Halloween type-mask.'

Along with the mask, the man wore an all-black ensemble consisting of gloves, sneakers, pants and what is believed to be a Adidas brand tracksuit top.
