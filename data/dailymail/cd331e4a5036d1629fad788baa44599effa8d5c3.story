A school in Indiana is campaigning for gay students or couples not to be invited to their prom. 

Several parents and students at Sullivan High School, in Indiana, as well as the local church, have joined the crusade for a 'traditional prom' which would ban homosexual people attending. 

Diana Medley, believed to be a special education teacher at a different school but supporter of the campaign, told local news site My Wabash Valley: 'We don't agree with it and it's offensive to us.

Backlash: A Facebook group called Support The Sullivan High School Prom For All Students has been set up in protest

'Homosexual students come to me with their problems, and I don't agree with them, but I care about them.

'It's the same thing with my special needs kids, I think God puts everyone in our lives for a reason.'

'Do you think they have a purpose in life?

'No I honestly don't. Sorry, but I don't. I don't understand it. A gay person isn't going to come up and make some change unless it's to realise that it was a choice and they're choosing God.' 

Several pastors have also pledged their support to the movement according to the news site.

Anger: People have taken to Twitter to vent their anger at the plans to have an anti-gay school prom

Bill Phegley, who belongs to Carlisle Church, said: 'Christians have always been prepared for a fight. Jesus gave us armor for the front, not the back; we're not running anymore.'

But a Facebook page, called Support The Sullivan High School Prom For All Students, has been set up to defend the school's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender student body.

The page now has more than 4,000 likes. 

Karen Kirshner wrote: 'Shame on you Sullivan County anti-gay bias crime parents. 

'You have no good Christian right to commit such civil rights violations against gay students.'
