Most stars endure intense diets and fitness regimes prior to a televised awards show.

But Kaley Cuoco was instead taking a big bite out of a McDonald's hamburger before making her way down the Emmys red carpet on Monday evening.

The Big Bang Theory's resident blonde bombshell managed to look stunning as she sauntered in front of the cameras post-junk food fix.

The fast food theory: Most people would not follow her lead by gorging on a burger and fries before such a high profile event

In the pink: The Big Bang Theory's leading lady Kaley Cuoco lived up to her million dollar billing on the Emmy Awards red carpet on Monday

Despite recently landing a million dollar per episode pay raise to stay on the programme, Kaley couldn't resist the burger and serving of fries off McDonald's dollar menu.

The 28-year-old, who plays the programme's dullard Penny, attended the otherwise formal evening in a beautiful red gown with pink floral detailing, rounding off her ensemble with a matching salmon-coloured clutch purse.

The saucy starlet was escorted down the red carpet by her handsome tennis pro husband Ryan Sweeting, who has dropped off the ATP world rankings due to recent inactivity.

After the cheeky actress posted the fast food-knoshing image on Instagram while 'getting ready' for her big night, she then gave her fans another treat.

It beats the US Open: No doubt her husband prefers attending glitzy showbiz bashes than grinding his way through qualifying tournaments

Kaley uploaded a cute selfie of herself 
with fellow million dollar star Jim parsons, who plays the ever popular 
Dr Sheldon Cooper on America's number one sitcom.

And perhaps it was a good luck charm, as he was later crowned best comedy actor, 
his fourth award in the category which brought him level with superstars Kelsey 
Grammer and Michael J. Fox

But Kaley was not the only stunner from the show flaunting her figure at the popular awards show.

Her fellow stars Melissa Rauch, who plays Bernadette, looked in fine form indeed in a form-fitting navy blue number.

She was complimented by Mayim Bialik, also known as Sheldon's girlfriend Amy Fowler, who dazzled in a similarly hued lacy frock with a puffy skirt.

A hair raising moment: The former Blossom star also posted an image of herself getting ready for the show

The show's red carpet crew was rounded off by Jim, who was escorted by his art director boyfriend Todd Spiewak, and the show's resident hunk Johnny Galecki.

Kaley and Jim were the only stars on the show, along with fellow favourite Johnny, to negotiate a budget busting episode fee during recent contract negotiations.

Despite being just as important to the show, fellow stars Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar's pay packets were only increased to the 'mid six-figure range', while Mayim and Melissa's fees trail far behind.
