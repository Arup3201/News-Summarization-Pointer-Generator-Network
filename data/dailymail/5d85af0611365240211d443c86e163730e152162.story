A teenager banished from the insulated world of the Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church (FLDS) has spoken about how his life has dramatically changed since being forced out of the polygamous sect.

Willy Steed, 19, together with his parents and six sisters were among a group of between 500 and 600 people banished by the sect’s leader - and so-called prophet - Warren Jeffs, who has spent the past seven years behind bars after being convicted of sexual abuse of young girls.

The Steed family received help of a group called Holding Out Help, a nonprofit for those leaving polygamist groups.

Willy was placed with a couple called Pam and Ron Jenson, who have helped him to reclaim his lost childhood and experience a number of things for the first time - including his first ride on a rollercoaster, his first birthday cake and even Facebook.

Like most boys in the FLDS, Steed was pulled out of grade school to work and so he has also had to learn to read for the first time.

Steed's life also took an unexpected turn in June, when he met a photographer who believed he had model potential and invited him to a photo shoot.

The invitation to become a model shows just how far Steed's physical and emotional transformation has come since leaving the sect.

‘Someone saw me for who I was and singled me out and picked me because of that,’ Steed told ABC News.

‘All my life [I] never believed in myself. It was so easy for me to get lost in the crowd of family, but out here it's so easy to be seen in a crowd and not get lost.’

Steed is one of the lucky ones. Just weeks after he left several of his close friends died in a car crash after a beer party.

Under the FLDS' strict religious code, boys and girls are forbidden from speaking to one another in their community and so many attend the secret desert parties.

‘There's a reason the young boys go out at night, and the young girls go to those parties,’ he told ANC News.

'It's because they can drink, they can be themselves and they can put away all that stress.’

According to church teachings, anyone who attends these parties becomes a ‘son of perdition.’

‘Son of perdition means you are Satan's property, and that you will burn in hell when you leave this life for what you have done,’ Steed explained.

The community lives a lifestyle far removed from the modern world with no internet, no television and little contact with the outside world.

Every aspect of life - what people wear, what they eat, even whom they marry - continues to be controlled by Jeffs, even though he is behind bars. Some of is more recent bizarre edicts have included banning toys, bicycles and the eating of corn.

The community, which has up to 10,000 members worldwide, still believes in their 'prophet' even though he is serving life plus 20 years for sexually abusing children.

Approximately 8,000 people still reside at the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas and they are still reportedly receiving instructions from him.

'We know he is innocent,' Dr. Maryam Holm, primary health care provider at the Yearning for Zion Ranch, told ABC.

'And we all yearn for his deliverance,' she added.

When questioned about why Jeffs is still allowed to give guidance from the jail cell, officials say there is little they can do.

'If somebody comes in and visits with him, and he gives them 
instructions and they take them back by word of mouth, there’s just 
nothing we can do to control that,' John Hurt, director of public 
information at the Texas Department of Corrections, told ABC News.

Followers of the movement had also congregated in sites in Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah.

Arizona's Attorney General Tom Horne in February announced a criminal probe of the FLDS and the Marshal's Office, which serves as a small police force in the twin polygamous towns Hildale and Colorado City.

A highly publicized raid in 2008 on the sect's community - the Yearning for Zion compound in Eldorado, Texas - revealed to the world for the first time the society Jeffs had been developing.

The move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in U.S. history.

Pictures showing members' unusual 
appearance, particularly of the women in the community who wear 
restrictive floor length dresses and are forbidden from cutting their 
hair, were broadcast across the world as 400 children were put in 
temporary custody for the duration of the police investigation into 
sexual abuse.

During his trial, jurors wept as they heard a graphic tape of the twisted sexual instructions Jeffs gave his brides - some of whom were just children.

He warned God would reject them if they did not to submit to his instructions and DNA evidence presented during the trial proved he had fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl.

'If the world knew what I was doing, they would hang me from the highest tree,' Jeffs wrote in a chilling journal entry from 2005 - one of thousands of pages of notes seized by authorities.

He was given life behind bars for one count of aggravated sexual assault and an extra 20 years, to be served consecutively, for the second count of sexual assault - the maximum allowed for each count.
