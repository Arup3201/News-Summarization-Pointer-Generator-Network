Pressure: Ed Miliband's stance on Syria has been questioned by senior party figures

Ed Miliband is coming under growing pressure from Labour heavyweights for his refusal to back the government on military action in Syria.

Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair said the Labour leader had got it wrong in the crunch Commons vote as former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said the party’s foreign policy had been reduced to ‘being nice to Iran’.

Mr Miliband faces growing division in his party over his decision to vote down the government, even after David Cameron moved to accept his concerns about not rushing to war.

The Labour leader initially said he backed a ‘limited’ strike against Syria, but urged Mr Cameron to tone down a government motion on military strikes for last week’s vote.

But the Prime Minister’s call for action was rejected by a majority of 13 MPs after 39 coalition MPs joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat.

Today Mr Blair issued his first major rebuke of the Labour leader, saying he disagreed with the way Mr Miliband had handled the who affair.

The former prime minister said: ‘I wrote before the vote that I thought we had to support action in Syria and I said after the vote that I was disappointed by it.

‘So this is something where I just have to disagree with the leadership of the party.

‘But I know it’s a difficult position for political leaders to be put in when they’ve got to take decisions like this, but my position on these issues is pretty clear over a long period of time.’

He was backed by Mr Bradshaw, a foreign office minister in the Blair government who was promoted to Culture Secretary by Gordon Brown.

The Exeter MP warned a ‘considerable number of Labour MPs (many more than have so said so publicly) feel deeply uneasy about’ the fact that Mr Miliband has ruled out a second vote on military action.

Writing in the Guardian, Mr Bradshaw expressed alarm that Mr Miliband was following the Prime Minister's lead rather than taking a ‘sensible and measured approach’.

On Wednesday Mr Miliband insisted the Commons vote was not about Britain 'shirking its responsibilities' but about preventing a 'rush' to war.

He repeatedly argued that the key was now bringing other countries to the table - including Iran - to help negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

But in a a direct swipe at Mr Miliband's approach, Mr Bradshaw said: ‘Does being nice to Iran and talking about Britain's now diminished diplomatic and humanitarian role constitute a foreign policy?

‘Labour needs to have clear and unambiguous answers to these questions. They will dominate politics through the party conference season.’

Division: Tony Blair said Mr Miliband had got it wrong on Syria while former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said many Labour MPs were 'uneasy' about the leader's position

Mr Bradshaw said the amendment Labour tabled to the Government motion setting out five conditions for military action last week was ‘clear and sound’.

‘Instead of sticking to this sensible and measured approach, we seem to have abandoned it because of the incompetence of a Tory prime minister’ he said.

‘We have allowed Labour foreign policy to be dictated by the Government.’

It comes after David Miliband put himself at odds with brother Ed to warn that international intervention in Syria is ‘increasingly necessary’.

The former foreign secretary condemned the failure of western governments including Britain to ‘break the diplomatic and military deadlock’ and warned humanitarian aid cannot reach refugees because aid agencies are coming under ‘aerial bombardment’.

His warning that Syria risks becoming a ‘dangerous no-man’s-land’ like Afghanistan appears at odds with Ed Miliband’s insistence that Labour will not back a second vote on UK military intervention.
