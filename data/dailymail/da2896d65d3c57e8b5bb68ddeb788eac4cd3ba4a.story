Garry Kasparov has revealed he believes Vladimir Putin to be a far bigger threat to the US than ISIS.

The former world chess champion also accused the Russian leader of being 'the most dangerous man in the world'.

Asked why he had issued such a stark warning, the political activist said that Putin 'plays poker while the rest of the world plays chess', warning that the Russian president's actions showed he had a tendency to try to call the world's bluff.

Warning: Garry Kasparov claims Vladimir Putin is the 'most dangerous man in the world'

He said Putin's next gamble would be to threaten to cut gas supplies to Europe and the former Soviet republics before the winter.

Kasparov believes that the threat will be more than enough to force America and Europe to back down from their recent round of sanctions.

In an interview with Yahoo News, the former grand master, 51, said: 'Putin is the most dangerous man in the world, a greater threat to the United States than the Islamic State.'

And he attacked President Barack Obama for being too late in checking Putin's actions in Ukraine that eventually led to Russia annexing Crimea.

Kasparov also slated European leaders, claiming that indifference to Putin's actions was similar to the complacency shown by leaders in the build-up to World War Two.

He said it was hypocritical for the US and its allies to supply arms to Syrian rebels opposed to ISIS but to refuse to agree to similar requests from Ukraine.

The 51-year-old also said the Islamic State militant group was simply a 'diversion' for the world to focus on.

But he said the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West would eventually work - but would only do so if they were left in place until at least March 2015.

Kasparov believes Putin will use Russia's huge supply of natural gas as a bargaining chip ahead of what he dubbed the coming 'cold winter', threatening to shut down supplies to Europe and other former Soviet republics.

Kasparov thinks that this threat could be enough to encourage an easing of penalties against Russia.

He also believes Putin is telling his associates that the western governments 'will blink' and is simply calling the world's bluff – 'playing poker while everyone else is playing chess'.

Kasparov, who once showed an interest in running for political office, said he now saw an uncertain future for Russia.

'We should forget about power in Russia changing hands throughout the election process. I'm afraid it will be not a very lawful process and it may eventually end up with the collapse of the country,' he said.
