She's walked the 
runway for Marc Jacobs, showcased her curves for Agent Provocateur and 
even bagged a date with heartthrob Harry Styles - and now Daisy Lowe is showing us why.

The model is the latest to join the #mycalvins social media campaign and celebrated by posting a saucy snap of herself in just her underwear on Instagram.

Daisy joins the likes of Miranda Kerr, Rita Ora, Jourdan Dunn and Ellie Goulding in this global social media campaign to promote Calvin Klein Underwear.

So THAT's why she's a top model! Daisy Lowe is the latest star to join the #mycalvins social media campaign, which involves posting a snap in your Calvin Kleins

The sultry black and white snap Daisy posted in her bedroom is part of the 'show yours. #mycalvins' campaign - an image-driven initiative to promote the brand’s latest men’s offering, Calvin Klein Dual Tone, via social media.

And the best is yet to come - the likes of Fergie, Iggy Azalea and Poppy Delevingne will soon be posting their own snaps.

It's been a busy fortnight for the 25-year-old. Daisy was one of the 70 women from the worlds of fashion, film, music, art 
and business picked to travel to the top cities of Europe for charity, 
and she certainly made sure it was a stylish trip.

Guess who started it! Miranda Kerr was the first to post her snap, which she captioned 'My new Calvin's #mycalvins #ad' underneath the Instagram shot of her modelling her 
underwear

The
 British model stepped out in three different outfits across the two 
days, and jumped into a red Mercedes to spread the word about charities of Cash & Rocket alongside the likes of Chloe Green.

She also attended the star-studded Anya Hindmarch and Mytheresa dinner at the capital's Royal Academy of Arts with model pal Alexa Chung on Tuesday night.

She tweeted: 'Thanks @mytheresaprgirl 
@antkendal and #AnyaHindmarch for a dream dinner in the dream location 
and giggles on tap @chungalexa'.

Daisy has also been busy penning her debut cookbook, Sweetness & Light - a new 
collection of recipes for 60 healthy sweet treats.

By making simple changes to ingredients, such as using maple syrup 
rather than refined sugar, or discovering new ingredients like raw 
chocolate, Daisy promises that her recipes are transformed into something 'devilishly 
delicious' but 'angelically healthy'.

Speaking about the £15 
book, which will hit shelves in July, Daisy said: 'This is the result of
 my journey to discover the craft of baking guilt-free delicious treats.

'I wanted to create a collection of recipes that ensure you can enjoy sweet things without harming your body.

'You’ll find recipes 
here to satisfy even the sweetest tooth. Many are gluten, dairy and 
refined sugar-free, some are vegan and others raw. Cook with love and 
make your body feel good.'

Split over seven 
chapters with names such as 'make-you-feel-great cakes', 'skinny 
puddings' and 'scream for ice cream', plus featuring treats such as 
apricot and ginger cake, frangipane tart with pears and lemon and lime 
scented granita, Daisy says there's a recipe suitable for any craving.

Daisy
 is adamant that we shouldn’t deprive ourselves of the foods we crave. 
She said: 'I never thought it would be possible for me to kick the sugar
 habit until I moved to New York.

'There,
 I tasted natural products that give you a sweet hit without harming 
your body. Recently I also found out that I am intolerant to wheat and 
dairy.

'A few of the 
healthy substitutions I’ve made for wheat, dairy and sugar in these 
recipes will be new to you, but you will easily be able to find them in 
health food shops and online.

'My body feels so much healthier and it works better. I have more energy, I sleep better, I get sick less often.

'I
 am feeding myself, not starving or depriving myself of the sweet things
 I love. I wanted to share these recipes so you can do the same, and 
love yourself from the inside out.'

Daisy,
 25, is so proud of her cooking skills that she hosts dinner parties for
 her showbiz pals, such as Nick Grimshaw and Pixie Geldof, as many as 
four times a week.

Speaking to Grazia Daily
 about her diet, the size 8 model said: 'I eat healthily for six days, 
then have Sunday off. It’s taken a long time for me to appreciate my 
curves. I get insecure about my shape every day.

'I love food so much, 
sometimes it’s a bit tricky. The weekend after fashion week, I had pizza
 for lunch, dinner and the leftovers for breakfast. Then I went to the 
NME Awards and they served Domino’s. I was like, “I stink of pizza!” I 
don’t starve myself ever, which is clearly why I’m not as tiny as models
 are - the teeny ones. But I’m OK with that.'

Daisy
 was first spotted in Camden at the age of 14. Fast forward 10 years and
 she has starred in major fashion campaigns for Marc by Marc Jacobs, 
Louis Vuitton and Agent Provocateur and walked for Chanel, Vivienne 
Westwood and Burberry.
