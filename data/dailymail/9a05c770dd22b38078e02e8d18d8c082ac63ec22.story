Six people were hurt - and one seriously injured - when a miniature train derailed at a safari park yesterday.

The rear carriage of the Jungle Express at Longleat, Wiltshire, overturned, trapping one person underneath and injuring five others.

Firefighters and paramedics were sent to the family attraction. But by the time they arrived the trapped person was reportedly pulled free by frantic visitors at the park.

A total of 115 people - including many children - were on the train at the time.

Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said two crews were dispatched to the scene at 3.45pm today.

Three ambulances and an air ambulance were also sent amid fears of a major incident at the popular attraction.

A fire service spokeswoman said: 'We were told that their little train had overturned and we sent a crew from Warminster and one from Westbury.

'Six people have been injured - five had minor injures.

'One person who has been underneath the overturned carriage but had been released by the time we got there.

'I think they are being transferred to hospital by ambulance. From our perspective the train had already been made safe.

'We remained at the scene, just helping the ambulance personnel with just looking after people - just extra bodies to keep people calm.'

The steam locomotive has nine carriages and is one of the attractions at the park's Jungle Kingdom.

It takes visitors past the sea lions, bird sanctuary and gorilla pens.

A spokesman for the park said: 'One carriage went on to its side and the other remained upright, the other carriages stayed on the track.

'Staff immediately instigated the emergency procedure to safely evacuate all passengers from the train and the emergency services were notified.

'There were 155 people on the train at the time.

'At this time there are three people confirmed to have sustained injuries and have been taken to hospital.

'Staff are currently undertaking a thorough investigation into what caused the incident and the railway will remain closed during this time.'
