Crime novelist Reginald Hill, who created the detective characters Dalziel and Pascoe, left £2.6 million in his will.

Hill, who died aged 75 in January, wrote 24 bestselling novels featuring Yorkshire detectives Superintendent Andrew Dalziel and Inspector Peter Pascoe.

His characters inspired the BBC TV drama Dalziel And Pascoe, which ran for 12 series between 1996 and 2007 and regularly had audiences of more than eight million. 

Detective work: Warren Clarke and Colin Buchanan starred in the BBC adaptation of Dalziel and Pascoe.

The show featured Warren Clarke as the politically incorrect Dalziel, while Colin Buchanan played Pascoe, a sociology graduate.

Probate records released last  week disclose that Hill left his entire net estate of £2,628,728 to Patricia, his wife of 51 years. The couple had no children.

The author, who was born in Hartlepool, County Durham, in 1936, died at his home near Ravenglass, Cumbria, after a year-long battle with cancer.

Crime novelist Reginald Hill died in January, aged 75.

The son of a professional footballer, he was brought up in Carlisle.

At Stanwix primary school, he recalled: "I was always scribbling."

Hill once said that he wrote "for fun" from an early age and ended up with "a bottom drawer of first chapters".

He passed the 11-plus and at Carlisle Grammar School excelled at English.

After National Service between 1955 and 
1957, he went up on a scholarship to St Catherine’s College, Oxford, 
where he played rugby.

Graduating in English Literature in 1960,
Hill became a schoolmaster and later lectured at Doncaster College of 
Education before deciding to become a full-time writer in 1980.

By the age of 30, he began looking to writing as a career and the first Dalziel and Pascoe novel was published four years later.Fuelled by the success of the BBC television adaptations, Hill went on to find a worldwide audience.

A series of five books set in Luton featuring a black private investigator called Joe Sixsmith followed, with a host of other novels published under other names, including a series of thrillers as Patrick Ruell.

Hill won the Crime Writers’ Association Cartier Diamond Dagger for Lifetime Achievement in 1995.
