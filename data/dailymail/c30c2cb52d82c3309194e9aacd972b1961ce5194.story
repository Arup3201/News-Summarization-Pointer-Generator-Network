Mohamed Diame pointed to another evening of frustration in front of goal as the main reason for West Ham's Capital One Cup exit on Tuesday night.

The Hammers were beaten on penalties by Sky Bet League One side Sheffield United having dominated for most of the 120 minutes leading to the shoot-out.

Summer signing Diafra Sakho marked his full debut with the opening goal for Sam Allardyce's side but Sheffield United levelled when Winston Reid scored an unfortunate second-half own goal.

Blades goalkeeper Mark Howard was in inspired form to deny a string of West Ham chances - and kept out Enner Valencia's penalty as the visitors secured a 5-4 shoot-out win.

With 23 shots over the course of the night, West Ham will feel they create plenty of opportunities to progress in a competition where they reached the semi-finals last year.

It was a similar story on their defeat at home to London rivals Tottenham on the opening day of the Barclays Premier League season and Diame knows that, with the help of new attacking coach Teddy Sheringham, the Hammers must improve their conversion rate.

'It's a shame we didn't win this game at home,' he said.

'But we need to keep going now and focus on the league. We missed chances against Tottenham and didn't win the game, we took our chances against Crystal Palace and we won (3-1).

'We have to keep focused and keep going. We're doing great work with Teddy Sheringham in front of goal, so we have to keep working and try to score goals.'

Allardyce's side are back at Upton Park in league action on Saturday when they welcome Southampton to east London, with Diame targeting a second win of the season.

'Every time we play at home we need to play for the three points,' he added.

'It's going to be a big game because Southampton are a good, strong team. I saw them against Liverpool and they played well.

'We need to be ready for this game and make sure we take the three points.'

Sheffield United captain Michael Doyle converted the winning penalty following Valencia's miss - but Howard revealed he was eager to provide the heroics from the spot as well as on his goal-line.

'I do fancy myself to be fair,' he said.

'I wanted to be in the top five (penalty takers) - it is another string to your bow. We all practice penalties in training before cup ties and I'm no different, I like taking them as well as saving them.'

Former Arsenal trainee Howard also praised the work done by video analysts at the club to help secure progression into the third round.

'I had done a bit of homework before,' he said.

'Our video guys helped me out and they told me the right way to go for that one. It does help to do your homework. It is a great feeling but, overall with our grit and determination, I felt we deserved to win it.

'The standard of our penalties was excellent. It is totally different for a goalkeeper, as an outfield player you can practice until the cows come home but it is a total different situation under the pressure.

'As a goalkeeper you don't feel that pressure - it just feels like someone wants to score past you.'
