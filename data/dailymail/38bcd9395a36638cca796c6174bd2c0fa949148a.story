Holding toys: Jameson Davis has been given prosthetic arms for the first time. The 9-month-old's arms stopped growing at the shoulder during pregnancy

A baby from Washington born without arms has been given his first prosthetic limbs and is already enjoying reaching for his toys.

Nine-month-old Jameson Davis suffered an abnormality in pregnancy which stopped his arms growing below the shoulder, KXLY.com reports.

Determined to give him the best opportunity in life possible, his parents Brooke and Jim started saving and fundraising to buy him $25,000 prosthetic limbs.

And the family are now enjoying watching him use reach for toys and use his arms for the first time.

'It's just been amazing to see him like pull this up to his own mouth, before we would have to hold the toy or teether, now he can do it,' Brooke said.

The family from Spokane say they  were overwhelmed by their community’s response with old and young and rich and poor contributing to the fund.

'We couldn't ask for any more for our baby, the love that we felt from the community is awesome,' Brooke said.

'A little boy wrote us a letter saying he wanted to give $5 to Jameson out of his piggy bank just so he could help,' father Jim Davis added.

The arms were fitted by Advanced Arm Dynamics in Portland Oregan, they also help with hand-eye coordination, vision depth and distance.

However, the family have another hurdle ahead as Jameson will need further prosthesis as he grows  - and eventually they want him to have pair of electric arms.

‘Myoelectric means that they will be a prosthesis which pick up on electrical charges in his muscles in his short arms and it will convert those to movements in the prosthesis,’ Jim explained.

Myoelectric arms cost around $50,000 and $100,000.

The family will begin fundraising again next month but for now they are just grateful to see their little boy fully mobile. 

'Thank you again to all of Jameson’s supporters, Brooke wrote on her fundraising blog. 'We 
could not have gotten this far with out you.'
