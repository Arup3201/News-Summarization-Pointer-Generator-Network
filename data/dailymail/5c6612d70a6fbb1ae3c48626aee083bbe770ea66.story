Arsene Wenger is seeking clarification on Javi Martinez's future at Bayern Munich before he presses ahead with a £20million move for Lars Bender.  

As it stands, Bayer Leverkusen's Bender remains the Gunners' leading midfield transfer candidate, with club officials feeling he is the best realistic option open to them this summer.

Big fan: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is huge admirer of Bayern midfielder Javi Martinez

But they are monitoring Martinez's future and, amid rumours the Spaniard is unhappy at Bayern, they have enquired about his availability.  

Wenger tried to sign Martinez ahead of the 2012-13 season as a replacement for the outgoing Alex Song. But Arsenal were blown out of the water by Bayern who met the midfielder's £32m release clause.

However, Wenger remains a huge admirer of Martinez, 25, and would jump at the chance of landing the midfielder, who can also play centre back.

Most wanted: Arsenal's top target is Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan

Priority: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants to strengthen his squad

Arsenal are looking to strengthen their squad in the summer and a defensive midfielder is a priority.

The club's ideal target is Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan, but they realise their chances of landing the highly coveted Germany international are slim.

Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is another option.
