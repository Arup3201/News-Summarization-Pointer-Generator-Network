Organisers are currently putting the finishing touches to Europe’s largest display of giant Chinese illuminations for an event taking place in Britain this winter.

Around 25 miles of LED lights have been used to create 20 different dazzling displays for the Festival of Light at Longleat House in Wiltshire, which will officially open next month.

The highlights of the spectacular event are a 230ft long dragon made up of 23,000 lit porcelain cups, bowls and plates and a mythical creature called a Gilin, which is made from at least 30,000 glass phials filled with coloured liquid.

The beautifully intricate structures which are dotted throughout the grounds, took a team of 50 more than six months to make

Longleat's Festival of Light takes the tradition of Chinese lanterns and transforms and updates it with LED lights for a modern audience

The display also features a 65ft tall Chinese temple, huge traditional Chinese masks, a family of life-size pandas, giant elephants and other animals including zebras, lions and deer.

In total, 30 tons of steel has been used to build the frames for the illuminated structures.

A team of 50 highly-skilled craftsmen from the village of Zigong in China’s Sichuan province have spent six months creating the structures and will remain at Longleat throughout the festival, which runs until the New Year.

Written records of lantern festivals in China date back 2,000 years and Zigong is considered to be the home of the finest due to its ingenious concepts and beautiful designs.

Bob Montgomery, chief executive of Longleat House, said: “The Festival of Light is something truly unique.

“We are taking the age-old tradition of the Chinese lantern and completely transforming it for a modern audience using giant LED illuminated structures.

“There will be around 20 different scenes to explore over 30 acres, created from a mixture of silk, satin and vinyl covering fixed frames, and the sheer scale and intricacy of the designs is breath-taking.

The grounds have been transformed into a wonderland by the beautiful light sculptures which are dotted throughout

“We’ve spent close to six months working with a team of experts from Zigongto make this a reality.

“Nothing like it has been attempted on this scale before in the UK - it’s about as far away from those familiar lightweight flying lanterns as it’s possible to get.

“These are fixed, larger-than-life illuminated tableaux which people can wander through.”

The Festival of Light opens on November 14 and runs until January 4. 

Organisers say the Festival of Light is the first of its kind in the UK as nothing on this scale has been attempted before

Some of the 50 talented sculptors from Zigong put the final touches to the herd of illuminated zebras which will adorn the grounds

The giant Chinese illuminations have been described by event organisers as 'larger-than-life illuminated tableaux'
