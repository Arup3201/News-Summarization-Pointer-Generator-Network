Chris Froome closed to within 19 seconds of race leader Alejandro Valverde at the Vuelta a Espana, despite crashing on Friday's seventh stage.

The Team Sky rider crashed just before tackling the first categorised climb on the 169 kilometres route from Alhendin to Alcaudete.

He needed bandaging on his right arm but, having initially fallen more than a minute adrift of the peloton, recovered to rejoin it and then leapt clear of the main group with a sprint finish to come home seventh and pick up valuable seconds.

Alessandro de Marchi won the stage, having led a four-strong breakaway, with Valverde of Movistar holding on to the red jersey, 15 seconds ahead of team-mate Nairo Quintana and 18 clear of Alberto Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo).

De Marchi burst clear of the breakaway group in the closing kilometres, finishing ahead of Ryder Hesjedal (Garmin Sharp). Hesjedal's general classification hopes took a huge blow with a poor showing on Thursday and the GC contenders were content to let him form part of the breakaway, which moved clear after 40km.

Hubert Dupont (AG2R La Mondiale) crossed the line in third.
