An innocent bystander was shot and killed by a 14-year-old boy on a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday evening.

The victim, identified by the police as Angel Rojas, 39, of East Flatbush, was rushed to Woodhull Medical Center, where he died a short time later, the police and emergency workers said.

The shooting occurred shortly before 6:30 p.m. on a B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

Married father-of-two Angel Rojas, 39, was declared dead at a Brooklyn hospital after he was shot by a 14-year-old boy following a disagreement on a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus on Thursday evening

The
 victim was shot in the back of the head after tragically being in the wrong place at
 the wrong time when a dispute involving several teenagers broke out on 
the bus.

The alleged killer and some other 
teens were sitting at the rear of the bus when an apparent rival
 boarded and started walking toward them, sources said.

'One kid pulls out a gun and he lets off a couple of rounds,' the source told the New York Daily News.

'He’s
 running out of the bus, still letting rounds go, and this poor guy gets
 shot in back of the head. He wasn’t the intended victim.'

Cops found six empty shell casings at the scene, police sources said. No other injuries were reported.

The
 teenager was taken into custody, and authorities said they seized a 
revolver from him.

No charges had been filed as of late Thursday night.

Rojas was pronounced dead at Woodhull Medical Center.

Originally from the Dominican Republic, he had moved to the U.S. about four years ago with his wife, Maria Lopez, 41, their son, Saury, 12, and daughter, April, 8.

He worked at two grocery stores and would take the bus home in between shifts to hug his children and get something to eat, according to his family. 

'That was very bad of him,' son Saury said of his father's killer. 'He’s too small to be with a gun. If he didn’t have that gun, my dad would be alive now.'

Police have said that they believe the teenager was the only shooter and they're reviewing surveillance footage from a laundromat near the crime scene.
