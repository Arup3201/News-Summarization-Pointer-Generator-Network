Donning a black suit and with his wavy blond hair slicked back, the convict looked forlorn as he spoke to his attorney, Whitney Boise (hired by Miley), before being escorted out of the courthouse.

Helt, an aspiring model, was arrested on a series of misdemeanor charges - including breaking into an apartment - in his native Oregon in 2010, receiving probation.

But during the following year, he missed meetings with his probation officer, violated his curfew and failed to complete community service after moving to Los Angeles. 

During his time in the Californian city, he sought modeling work, toiled at a few low-paying jobs and was homeless from time to time.

Speech: Helt is pictured making Miley's acceptance speech, alongside presenter Jimmy Falon, after she won the VMA video of the year award. During the speech, he spoke about homelessness in the U.S. and LA

Miley, who scooped the VMA award for her song 'Wrecking Ball', said she met Helt while touring the Hollywood homeless center My Friend's Place, before later befriending him. 

During the awards ceremony, she was seen wiping tears from her eyes as Helt spoke to the audience about homelessness in the U.S. and Los Angeles while host Jimmy Fallon held the microphone.

He also told viewers how they could donate to the homeless center, while Miley's Facebook page was updated with a video explaining how they could give cash.  

Shortly after the ceremony, news of Helt's previous crimes hit the headlines, prompting the 21-year-old singer to tweet about Helt.

Miley, who touched down in Los Angeles on Saturday after completing the South American leg of her Bangerz tour, wrote: 'People who are homeless have lived very hard lives. Jesse included.'

She later added: 'I hope that this can be the start of a national conversation about youth homelessness and how to end it.' 

On August 29, Helt turned himself in to authorities in his rural community, 60 miles southwest of Portland, after a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was later freed on $2,500 bail.  

Last month, he got a rebuke from Judge Campbell after showing up 45 minutes late to a hearing. The judge told him to 'bring a toothbrush' if he was tardy to today's probation violation hearing.

Messing around: Shortly after the awards ceremony and news of Helt's previous crimes hit the headlines, the 21-year-old singer tweeted: 'People who are homeless have lived very hard lives. Jesse included'

Far from being late, Helt turned up 20 minutes early to the courthouse. 

However, it did not win any points with Judge Campbell, who agreed with prosecutor Aaron Felton's recommendation for six months in jail. Helt will get credit for 57 days previously served.

Mr Boise unsuccessfully asked Judge Campbell to give Helt one more chance to meet the terms of his probation, saying his client grew up in poverty and has never known stability or discipline.

He agreed that Helt made a big mistake in not following through on the terms of his probation, but noted that he did not run afoul of the law while in Los Angeles.

He added that his client's appearance on MTV has given him a calling, helping youth. 

Rather than make money off his '10 minutes of fame', Helt has done volunteer work while hoping to enroll in community college to learn how to install solar panels, he said.

'In a few words, he wants to change his life,' Mr Boise said. 'He wants to make a difference.'
