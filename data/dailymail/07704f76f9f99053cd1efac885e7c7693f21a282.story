Grand Rapids Griffins ice hockey player Mitch Callahan shared a gruesome image of his bloody mouth after he was hit in the face by a puck.

Callahan, 22, uploaded the picture to his Twitter account just minutes after he was struck by a teammate's shot during an American Hockey League game against Iowa on Wednesday.

Callahan, who was already missing his two top front teeth, lost 10 teeth and suffered a broken jaw and split lip in the incident and underwent surgery on Thursday.

He was helped off the ice with a towel over his mouth as his teammates began looking for his teeth and, around 15 minutes later, he shared the photo with the message: 'Ouch.'

After posting the photo, he was taken to the hospital and the Detroit Red Wings prospect was undergoing surgery on Thursday, Wings general manager Ken Holland told the Detroit Free Press

Callahan was hit by a slap shot from team-mate Ryan Sproul, who feels guilty about the incident, according to a former Griffins player, Luke Glendening.

'He 
feels terrible,' Glendening said. 'He didn't want to talk about it. He 
feels bad. I guess Cally got cross-checked and he was falling as Sproul 
shot it, but he still feels terrible.'

Callahan is the the Grand Rapids Griffins' second-top goalscorer and the team went on to beat Iowa 6-1 in the game on Wednesday night.
