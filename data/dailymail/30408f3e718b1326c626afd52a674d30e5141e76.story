The mom of a three-year-old who works in fast food, a man who just graduated from a study course aged 49, another who cares full-time for his mom - and two men who are in prison.

They may seem very different, but these people have something in common - their lives have been blighted by an addiction to methamphetamine.

Esther Allison, Glenn Lagrew, James Hibbs, Joseph Harris, and Perry Bennett became the public faces of drug abuse when their mugshots were used in the Faces of Meth campaign in 2004 - and are still recognized for it today.

And - thanks to an extensive investigation by The Oregonian - with some making steady progress kicking the drug, holding down jobs and making their way in life.

Public faces: Esther Allison, now 38, is pictured above in jailhouse mugshots showing the effects of meth addiction over just eight months. She now works as a manager in McDonald's

Today: Allison is now out of jail and has a managerial job at McDonald's - as well as a son to look after

Decline: The above mugshots show how the drugs aged  Glenn Lagrew, who has done 17 years of jail time

Out and working: Lagrew now has two jobs - and graduated from an education program in June

Reporter Kasia Hall tracked down six of the eight drug users who featured in the campaign, which was born from a project by a sheriff's deputy at the Multnomah County Jail in Portland, Oregon.

Deputy Bret King was the ravaged faces in front of him every day, and compiled mugshots of the most extreme examples into a drug prevention package which made it round the country thanks to its stark, visual message.

Some of those featured later revealed that they hated the fact that their problems were made so public - while others are glad if their pictures turn anybody away from the same path.

Allison was tracked down by The Oregonian to a home in Carlton, an hour outside of Portland.

Despite last being arrested as recently as 2012, the 38-year-old has managed to turn her life around, splitting her energies between caring for her son and working as a manager at a McDonald's.

Shocking: Images such as these - showing Theresa Baxter - were compiled in the Faces of Meth campaign, which showed the stark physical effects of using the drug

Grizzled: Patrick Lucas, now 51, is another former addict whose image was featured in the attention-grabbing campaign

She began using meth as early as 12, she said,  while she was living in foster homes around Portland. She later became homeless and worked as a prostitute - but now has something to live for and is trying to shake her association with the drug.

She said: 'Everybody knows your name here, but I'm trying to be a good mom. Now, I'm a manager at McDonald's. That means something to me.'

Lagrew, 49, graduated from an education program this year in Portland and now holds down two jobs: working in a warehouse and delivering home equipment.

But the former addict, also a father, has spent a total of 17 years behind bars - and during one of the appearances landed in the campaign.

Speaking at the graduation ceremony, he said: 'I want to make amends to the city and be a role model so my son ... will make it out, too.' He told The Oregonian he hopes to be an addictions counselor and help others.

James Hibbs is a third who made it out and is now clean. He started using the drug aged just 15, while travelling with his carnival worker parents, and ended up homeless in Portland - where he says the generosity of locals meant he had no trouble supporting his habits by begging.

Troubled past: James Hibbs, pictured above in successive mugshots, started using meth when he was just 15

Now: Hibbs is now married and cares for his mom in their Spokane, Washington home. He says participating in the campaign - and potentially turning people away from meth - makes him feel better

In an interview with the newspaper, he said: 'Other people should see what [meth] does.

'Even though I'm dumb enough to do it, if I can convince anybody else from doing it, that makes me feel better. Not everybody has to be as dumb as I was.'

Though he was once a gang member - and has the tattoo to prove it - he says it has been seven years since he used the drug. He now lives with his wife and ill mother, whom he cares for, in Spokane, Washington.

However - the stories of those whose images were turned into a weapon against the drug that so damaged them are not uniformly positive.

Two of the eight faces are still behind bars - and one admits he is likely to start using again once he gets out.

Joseph Harris, 52, has been using meth since he was 14. And he told the paper that as soon as he is let out of Jefferson County Detention Center, Kansas, he will probably start up again.

Pocked:  Joseph Harris, 52, has one of the most shocking set of mugshots. But according to a recent interview, he will take up meth again once he leaves jail in Kansas

Arrested not long after a pressure cooker exploded while preparing the drug, his pockmarked faces from 2000 is one of the most shocking in the series.

He said he hopes to keep living in Kansas with his girlfriend once he leaves jail - and to pay his way by fixing up then selling his dad's Montana ranch.

Perry Bennett, 50, is also in jail - this time a correctional facility in Portland. He has spent just over half his life inside and has repeatedly tried to quit meth.

Hoping to fix it: Perry Bennett, shown above, has spent more than half his life in jail - but now has a son and hopes to stay clean when he is next released for his sake

Missing link: Jennifer Lundgren, shown above at the times of her arrests, could not be found for an update

But he said that once he is released next month he will approach the task with renewed vigor because he now has a son - which could spur him to leave the drugs behind.

Two more of the subjects - Theresa Baxter and Jennifer Lundgren - either could not be found or would not agree to be interviewed - but their shocking images of decline continue to form be used as a tool in the war of meth.
