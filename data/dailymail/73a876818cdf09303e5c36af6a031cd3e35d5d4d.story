Trial: Marcin Kostrzewa (pictured today arriving at Plymouth Crown Court) allegedly broke into his neighbour's flat and took the restricted files

A Polish man stole secret documents about British nuclear submarines from a neighbour and tried to sell them to his government for £50,000, a court heard today.

Marcin Kostrzewa, 31, of Plymouth, Devon, allegedly broke into Shane Spencer’s next-door flat and took the restricted files which were stored in his airing cupboard.

They only met when Kostrzewa knocked on Mr Spencer’s door to complain about noise - but he became ‘infatuated’ with him after finding out he worked with submarines, the court was told.

Kostrzewa allegedly took the documents after searching online for terms such as ‘spy games’, ‘spies’ and ‘secret documents’ - then contacted the Polish embassy and tried to sell the papers. 

Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said Kostrzewa entered the flat of Mr Spencer, who works as an engineer on submarines at the Royal Naval dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth.

Mr Chalk told Plymouth Crown Court the Polish man took ‘sensitive or secret material’ and was caught by a joint operation between British security services and the Metropolitan Police.

Kostrzewa thought he was in contact with a man called 'Alex' from the Polish government - but in fact he was a UK security services agent.

Mr Chalk said the two men met in a Plymouth hotel and their conversation about the deal was recorded. Kostrzewa also allegedly claimed he had stolen the contents of a computer hard drive.

The jury heard at the time Mr Spencer was working as an engineer and was involved with designs for Trafalgar and Astute class submarines.

Mr Spencer first met Kostrzewa in late 2011 when the Pole had knocked on his door to complain about noise, the court was told.

Mr Spencer’s girlfriend Sophie Berriman concluded that Kostrzewa was lonely and kept turning up at weekends and in the evenings with alcohol. She thought he was ‘infatuated with Shane’.

Mr Chalk said: ‘He said he worked on submarines and showed him a picture of a bulkhead - and that image excited the defendant.’

That unrestricted image from a Trafalgar class submarine was one of those later stolen - and Mr Chalk said the Pole must have seen the folder, which was also stolen.

Mr Chalk said Kostrzewa’s frequent attendance began to grate on Mr Spencer and his friends, they refused to answer the door to him and he could be heard saying ‘you reject me, you reject me’.

The court heard that the Pole asked Mr Spencer out for a drink but Kostrzewa let himself back into his neighbour’s flat alone - telling a flatmate he had ‘lost’ Mr Spencer.

Miss Berriman also found that she had lost her key to her boyfriend’s flat and Kostrzewa let her into the shared entrance - and then allegedly said he had found her key on the floor of a Co-op store.

She was surprised that the key had fallen off the tight-fitting keyring. In the covert recording with the agent Alex, the defendant allegedly said he had ‘acquired keys to Shane Spencer’s flat’.

Mr Chalk said on various dates in March 2014, Kostrzewa used search engines on his computer, entering words including ‘spy games, secret documents, spies, consulate Republic of Poland’.

Mr Spencer went to Gibraltar to work from March 19 to 25. The prosecutor said: ‘He then offered to sell off the documents relating to UK submarines to the Polish government.’

In April agent Alex rang the Pole and they met on April 10 in Plymouth, going to a hotel room which was rigged up with hidden recording gear.

He allegedly said he found a key to access the flat and stole the relevant papers and planned to copy Mr Spencer’s hard drive - and wanted £50,000 for the information.

Alex said he 'needed time to consider the documents'. In the recorded conversation, the defendant said ‘this is only the beginning’.

He told Alex his neighbour Mr Spencer ‘designs nuclear submarines’ - and said Mr Spencer did not know he had stolen the material from him, the court was told.

Kostrzewa allegedly said he pulled out the sheets of paper and replaced them empty sheets of paper to make the file look as thick in the folder.

He said he and Mr Spencer ‘booze it up on the vodka’ but his pharmacist girlfriend is intelligent and stops Mr Spencer talking about his work as a mathematician and physicist.

Alex asked him how much he wanted for ‘all of it’ with the hard disk - and Kostrzewa requested£50,000 for the material as ‘there are over 20 boats’ and ‘they are boats that are already sailing’.

Kostrzewa left the room and Met Police officers turned up at the hotel and studied the documents.

Alex allegedly then offered the Pole £4,000 but he said that ‘was not enough’. However, he said he would think about it - but would want the cash in £20 notes, the court was told.

As he left the room he was arrested by police. Kostrzewa denies burglary between January and April 2014. The trial continues.
