'Heartless': Sandra Cole, a frail pensioner with arthritis and a heart problem was forced to walk five miles home in the rain

A pensioner had to walk for three hours to get home after being ordered off a bus for having a pass that was ‘too worn’.

Sandra Cole, aged 68, who has arthritis and a heart problem, walked the five miles to her home in Tile Hill, Coventry, after a row with a bus driver.

The female bus driver confiscated her pass after telling her it was too worn to check her ID, then ordered her off the bus.

The retired nurse had to walk home because she did not have enough money to pay for another bus ticket.

After her son lodged a complaint about the 'heartless' way she was treated, the bus company Stagecoach apologised and said she should have been allowed to continue her journey.

Mrs Cole, a full-time carer for her disabled husband Hugh, says she felt humiliated by the incident which happened as she tried to board the X17 bus near Crackley Lane on the outskirts of Kenilworth.

Sandra Cole, who has arthritis and a heart problem, endured a three-hour trek to her home in Tile Hill, Coventry from where she was ordered off the bus in Crackley Lane

The X17 Stagecoach bus in Kenilworth, like the one Mrs Cole, 68, was ordered to get off

Mrs Cole says she had no choice but to walk the five mile route home through Crackley Woods, Cannon Hill, and Canley.

It was nearly three hours before she arrived home, which she says was distressing knowing her wheelchair-bound husband was probably in need of her help.

'[The driver] was heartless...she said it wasn’t her problem when I told her I’d have to walk five miles. It was so humiliating. I felt intimidated, like I’d been abandoned.'

Mrs Cole added that she had used the pass for three years without any problems and had used it earlier that day. 

'I can't let it happen again. What if she does this to someone more frail than me? Someone who can barely walk, or a child?'

Her son Alastair, 34, a teacher in London, was so incensed by the way his mother was treated he lodged an immediate complaint with Stagecoach, and received an apology from the company three days later.

A Stagecoach boss confirmed it was company policy to remove a pass if the photo and name were no longer visible.

A Stagecoach spokesman said: 'We are very sorry to hear of Mrs Cole’s experience in using our bus service.

'While the driver was correct in removing a concessionary pass which was totally illegible, with the photo and name rubbed off, it is our policy to still carry the passenger to their intended destination.

'We will be investigating this further and taking any appropriate action necessary.'
