Coffee chain Caffe Nero has not paid a penny in UK corporation tax since 2007 despite racking up around £100million in profits.

The popular British coffee house has become the latest big firm to come under fire over its tax affairs, in the wake of US behemoths Starbucks, Amazon, and Google.

One MP said the revelations over its tax affairs would be ‘hard to take’ for family-owned cafe owners around the country and accused Caffe Nero of ‘free-loading on the back of British taxpayers’.

Criticised: The popular British coffee house, which has not paid corporation tax since 2007, has become the latest big firm to come under fire over its tax affairs, in the wake of US behemoths Starbucks, Amazon, and Google

The Italian-style coffee house has become a firm fixture on the High Street, with 566 outlets in the UK.

Over the weekend the chain announced ambitious plans to open another 225 outlets over the next five years, creating 1,700 new jobs. It is also expanding into the US.

But HM Revenue & Customs has very little to show from Caffe Nero’s breakneck expansion since it started life in 1997 as single coffee house in South Kensington.

Analysis of its company accounts show it has not paid any tax since its financial year ending May 31, 2007.

In the period since then it has notched up just under £1billion in sales and made profits before tax of around £100million.

Latest filings to Companies House shows the privately-owned company made a £21.1million profit in the year ended May 31 2013 and generated £204.3million in sales.

Founder, chief executive and chairman Gerry Ford has defended his business’s tax affairs, arguing profits have been wiped out by interest payments on its debts of £250million.

The 56-year-old entrepreneur also told
 a Sunday newspaper that his firm’s complex structure, including the 
decision to base its holding company in Luxemburg ‘has no implications 
for our corporate tax at all’.

He added: ‘It wasn’t set up as a financial engineering thing. We’re not in the same category as Starbucks.’

Mr
 Ford, who owns 60pc of Caffe Nero since taking the company private in 
2007, added that the firm paid £21million in VAT last year and 
£13million in National Insurance contributions.

But last night the comments received short shrift from MPs and campaigners.

John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the influential Treasury Select Committee said:

‘Its unfair competition. If other cafes around the country including those owned by families are paying proper British taxes, why shouldn’t this company? I think people will be shocked to see Caffe Nero is free-loading on the back of the taxpayers’.

The issue of tax dodging by companies has soared up the political agenda, after revelations about a string of companies, including Starbucks, Google and Amazon sparked a public outcry.

US coffee giant Starbucks provoked a furious backlash from MPs and the public after it emerged it paid nothing in UK corporation tax between 2009 and 2012, despite sales of £400million in 2011.

It emerged that Starbucks reduced its tax bill by buying coffee beans for the UK through a Switzerland-based subsidiary and then roasting the beans in another subsidiary based in Amsterdam.

It finally agreed to pay £20million in corporation tax by 2015, in a bid to restore its reputation.

The Government has promised to crack down on companies and individuals using elaborate schemes to cut their tax bills.

There is no suggestion that Cafe Nero is doing anything illegal.

But Margaret Hodge, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee who last year grabbed headlines by branding Google’s tax dodging as ‘evil’, said:

‘It’s still far too easy for global companies to structure themselves so they do not pay their fair share of taxes. It’s about time the Government matched up to their tough rhetoric and really clamped down on this.’
