A second fence has been
erected along part of the White House grounds, pushing tourists
and passersby farther away after a fence jumper got into the
executive mansion.

The new waist-high barricade, which closes off part of the
sidewalk on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House,
went up late Monday or early Tuesday.

It is about 8 feet (2.4
meters) from the regular spike-topped fence.

Security around the White House perimeter has been intensified since last Friday when a 42-year-old Army veteran climbed over the fence and dashed across the north lawn and entered the executive mansion before being stopped

The barrier was erected after Iraq war veteran Omar
Gonzalez, 42, allegedly scaled the 7-foot (2.1-meter) fence on
Friday, ran across the White House lawn and entered the building
through an open door.

Gonzalez was carrying a pocket knife and had 800 rounds of
ammunition in his car, officials said. He was subdued by Secret
Service agents and has been charged with unlawful entry. 

President Barack Obama and his family were not in the building
when the incident occurred.

'This temporary closure is in effect while the Secret
Service conducts a comprehensive review of the fence jumping
incident,' agency spokesman Brian Leary said in an emailed
statement.

The House of Representatives oversight committee has
scheduled a September 30th hearing on the security breach. 

The Secret
Service is charged with safeguarding U.S. leaders and visiting
heads of state and government.

The Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House, which is
closed to traffic and is a favorite site for tourists and
protesters, had an increased number of Secret Service agents on
Tuesday, including at least one with a dog.

The agency is considering ways to expand the security zone
around the White House to keep the public farther away and do
more screening of people. 

Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, appeared in federal court on Monday to face charges of unlawfully entering restricted grounds while carrying a weapon. He could get 10 years in prison if convicted.

As he appeared in court, Virginia authorities also revealed he had been arrested last July and charged with possession of a sawed-off shot gun and eluding police.

During the proceedings on  Assistant U.S. Attorney David Mudd said Gonzalez, who has been homeless for three months following a decade in the army, was a danger to the president.

But relatives have insisted that Gonzalez, from Copperas Cove, Texas, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder after serving three tours in Iraq. He retired after losing part of his foot in an IED blast.

Jerry Murphy, whose mother was married to Gonzalez, said relatives always knew Gonzalez owned a small arsenal of weapons but said they doubted he intended to hurt Obama.

'I know he's got heavy artillery, you know? He's got all kinds of weapons and he was trained to use them,' Murphy said. 'I believe if he wanted to make a scene or cause problems, he very well could have. But it's clear that he didn't.'

Gonzalez was arrested Friday inside the Presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn, the Secret Service said. 

According to agents who arrested him, Gonzalez said that he was desperate to see the President to warn him about 'the atmosphere collapsing'.

President Obama and his daughters had left for Camp David via helicopter just minutes before Gonzalez allegedly rushed the northern entrance.

According to a criminal complaint obtained  authorities found 'several assault rifles' in a vehicle when he was arrested after speeding and eluding state police in Virginia in July.

After nearly crashing, Gonzalez was eventually pulled over.

Virginia State Police said that he had a map of D.C. with a circle drawn around the White House when he was arrested. They also allegedly found 11 different weapons in his car.

Then on August 25, he was stopped while walking along the fence of the White House. In that incident, authorities found he had a hatchet in his waist band.

He allowed cops to search his car, but they found no further weapons or ammo and he was not arrested.

The Army said Gonzalez enlisted in July 1997 and was assigned to the 10th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at Fort Hood, Texas. At the time, he listed his home as Puerto Rico.

He was discharged in September 2003 after completing his service obligation. Gonzalez enlisted a second time, in July 2005, and served until his retirement in late 2012.

Gonzalez served in Iraq from October 2006 to January 2008.

Samantha Bell, Gonzalez's ex-wife, said that after his second tour in Iraq, Gonzalez began carrying a .45 on his hip at all times.

He would also kept three or four rifles and shotguns behind the doors in their home, said Bell, who remarried and now lives in southern Indiana.

She claims she split up with him in 2010 because of his worsening mental condition

Bell described how Gonzalez kept the blinds drawn and would repeatedly go downstairs during the night to make sure the doors were locked and the oven was off. 

She said she once woke up in the middle of the night to find Gonzalez standing at the foot of the bed and staring at her. She said he told her he was simply watching her sleep.

'It was really odd and I didn't know how to take that,' she said. 'I just couldn't deal with it. I didn't want to deal with it, I couldn't — that's the whole reason I left. He was so paranoid he was starting to make me paranoid.

'Omar is a good guy, he's just got some issues that he needs help with. I think this is a cry out for help, what he's done. He really does need help. I just hope he can get it.'

Second arrest: Kevin Carr, 19, was taken in by officers on Saturday after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point outside the White House and then refusing to leave when he was asked

In the wake of his attempt on the White House, the Secret Service announced new, tougher security.

The agency was criticized for not apprehending Gonzalez sooner, and admitted their performance was 'not acceptable,' leading to new measures being put in place.

In a statement, Secret Service officials said: 'The challenge of securing the White House complex from security threats is ever present.

'Although last night the officers showed tremendous restraint and discipline in dealing with this subject, the location of Gonzalez's arrest is not acceptable. 

'In addition to the criminal investigation of Gonzalez by the Secret Service's Washington Field Office, Director Julia Pierson immediately ordered the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility to conduct a comprehensive after action review of the incident.' 

The statement continued: 'In the interim, Director Pierson has ordered the immediate enhancement of officer patrols and surveillance capabilities along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex. These measures went into effect last night.' 

In court: Gonzalez appeared at a federal court proceeding at this courthouse in Washington D.C. on Monday

President Obama has backed the agency. 

A White House spokesman said: 'The president has full confidence in the Secret Service and is grateful to the men and women who day in and day out protect himself, his family and the White House.'

However, press secretary Josh Earnest stressed that providing security to The White House was a 'complicated business' because of the number of tourists that visit on a daily basis. 

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also encouraged the public 'not second-guess the judgment of security officers who had only seconds to act.' 

He insisted in a statement issued today that the public should wait 'until all the facts are in' before passing judgement on the security services. 

Barriers:  The Secret Service announced that 'officer patrols and surveillance capabilities' would be enhanced in the wake of the two attempts by intruders to reach the White House  

Increased security: The measures came into affect along the Pennsylvania Avenue fence line around the White House complex on Monday  night 

The two-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House's north gates has been closed to vehicle traffic since May 1995.

President Bill Clinton ordered its immediate closure in an effort to prevent a potential car- or truck-bomb attack.

Even so, there have been a number of recent breaches that have caused the Secret Service and Capitol Police to step.

Last September a man was arrested and accused of throwing firecrackers over the fence on the north lawn. 

A few weeks later a Connecticut woman sparked a police chase through downtown Washington after ramming a security checkpoint. Miriam Carey, 34, was shot and killed after the bizarre incident. 

Another man was apprehended on September 11 before the anniversary commemorations after he jumped the White House fence 

He was charged last week in local court for unlawful entry, according to the Secret Service and is set to appear in court in October.
