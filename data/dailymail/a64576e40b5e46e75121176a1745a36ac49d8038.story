A grandfather has carved a wooden replica of the Bayeux Tapestry, despite having lost three of his fingers in an industrial accident.

Jason Welch, 43, has always been a dab hand with a chisel but didn’t know what he was getting himself into when he started the project in 2011.

The self-employed wood carver, from North Creake, Norfolk, decided to create a scale model of the 230ft tapestry to help cope with the grief of his 16-year-old son Ricky dying three years ago, and he has been hard at work in his shed ever since.

True dedication: Grandfather Jason Welch decided to create his Bayeux Tapestry replica to help cope with death of his son Ricky, who tragically died in 2011 aged 16

The self-employed wood carver managed to complete the incredibly intricate carvings despite losing three fingers in a horrific farming accident when he was aged 19

The grandfather-of-two searched for weeks before sourcing the 25 five foot planks of wood he needed for his project.

It took him two years to carve, paint, draw and then sand his 135ft long version of the historical Bayeux Tapestry.

He finally completed the work just before Christmas but says his masterpiece is now gathering dust in his workshop because it is so big.

Mr Welch, a self employed wood carver, said: 'I like working with my hands and keeping active... I had to draw all the detail onto these five foot panels, then chisel it and spend ages sanding it.'

Comparison: The original Bayeux Tapestry was created (bottom left and bottom right) was created over nine centuries ago. Legend suggests it may have been commissioned by William the Conqueror's wife. Jason Welch's version (top left and top right) was carved out of wood rather than embroided into cloth

Shame: He says the the 230ft scale model is now gathering dust as it is too big to put in his home. He is hoping someone will come forward to put it on display

Mr Welch added: 'That last part was the hardest because my hands started to ache because I don’t have all my fingers... I just hope that someone will get in touch with us and put it on somewhere for the year.'

Remembering the accident in which he lost his fingers, Mr Welch said: 'I was about 19 and I used to work on a farm... I had these gloves on and they got caught in a chain and cord. It pulled my hands into it and my fingers went.'

He added: 'It was horrific it really was. I lost all the fingers on my left hand bar my thumb. Luckily they managed to partially sew my little finger back on.'

After two years of hard graft in his workshop, Jason Welch finally completed his ambitious 230ft scale replica of the Bayeux Tapestry shortly before Christmas

Jason Welch has always been interested in history and religion so started working on the project without realising it would take up most of his spare time for two years

A slice of history: The original Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and is actually created from a piece of embroided cloth, not wood

Mr Welch was inspired to create the masterpiece after the tragic death of his 16-year-old son Ricky in 2011.

He says the daunting task kept his mind off the heartache that left he and partner Belinda, 42, devastated.

He added: 'Originally I started it because my son died and I trapped myself in my work shop... I was always interested in my history and religion so I just started doing it.'

'I just developed a passion for ancient history and just thought it would be a great achievement if I could actually carve the whole thing in planks of timber... I never imagined it would become what it is now. I’m really happy,' he said.

The most famous scene on the Bayeux Tapestry depicts King Harold being shot in the eye by an arrow. One theory suggests the work was commissioned by William the Conqueror's wife

The original Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and is actually created from a piece of embroided cloth, not wood.

It is more than nine centuries old and shows the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England that culminated in the famous battle.

French legend maintains it was commissioned and created by Queen Matilda, William the Conqueror’s wife and her ladies in waiting.
