Five Guantanamo Bay prisoners accused of helping orchestrate the September 11 terror attack- including self-proclaimed mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed- returned to court Monday as arguments resumed over preparations for a trial that remains distant.

It was the first time the five prisoners had been in court since February and they sat calmly through a morning's worth of dense legalistic testimony, with none of the outbursts that characterized previous sessions.

The court appearance came the same day that the Obama administration released the list of 48 prisoners they said were too dangers to ever let free.

Big day: Khalid Sheik Mohammed appeared in court on Monday alongside four other prisoners who were reportedly involved with the September 11 attacks

Mohammed, the self-proclaimed terrorist mastermind and lead defendant, wore a camouflage jacket and white turban, his bushy gray beard dyed reddish-orange.

The camouflage jacket was a point of contention in earlier procedural hearings as it was argued that he wanted to wear the garment in order to drive a point home that he considers himself a soldier in their fight.

In the audience, behind panels of glass that allow the government to cut off sound in case classified information is inadvertently uttered, were two retired New York firefighters injured while responding to the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, as well as relatives of other victims.

The spectators were chosen by lottery to view the proceedings at the U.S. base in Cuba. Several said they were eager to see it move along.

'They are obviously guilty, I think they have already admitted it, and the trial should happen as quickly as possible,' said Joe Torrillo, one of the two retired firefighters.

Mohammed has told the military that he was involved in a long list of terrorist plots, including the killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and has said in court that he was proud of his role in the September 11 plot.

The men have not yet entered pleas and defense lawyers say the men were tortured in CIA custody.In the start of what is scheduled to be five days of hearings on pretrial motions, the defense questioned retired Navy Vice Adm. Bruce MacDonald, the Pentagon legal official who oversaw the military tribunals until his term expired in March.

The government has asked for a trial in late 2014, though it's likely to be later.

Mohammed and his four co-defendants each face charges that include terrorism and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles planning and aiding the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States. They could get the death penalty if convicted.

The came the same day that a list released by the U.S. government Monday identified several dozen Guantanamo Bay prisoners who have been designated as too dangerous to release but who can't be prosecuted.

Names to faces: The 166 prisoners who remain detained in Guantanamo Bay have been known for years, but now the government identified which are denoted as ones who will never be released

Reaction: In response to the list of 46 'indefinite detainees', women protested outside the American embassy in Sana'a, Yemen

Those on the list are prisoners who 
have been held without charge under the Authorized Use of Military Force
act passed by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2001, 
said a spokesman for the Pentagon, Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale.

The
names of all Guantanamo prisoners have been public for years, but the 
administration of President Barack Obama had declined to disclose which 
detainees had been designated for indefinite detention in 2010 by an 
inter-agency review panel.

This will be the first public disclosure of the list, though the identity of many of them was widely known through their lawyers.

The government released the list after The Miami Herald sued for the document under the Freedom of Information Act.

International attention: Amnesty International protesters gathered in front of the site of the G8 summit in Belfast on Sunday calling for the release of all prisoners being held at the controversial base

Procedural: It was the first time the five prisoners had been in court since February and they sat calmly through a morning's worth of dense legalistic testimony, with none of the outbursts that characterized previous sessions

Most of the 48 on the list are from 
Yemen and Afghanistan. The Herald specifies that 26 men are from Yemen, 
12 from Afghanistan, 3 from Saudi Arabia, 2 from Kuwait, 2 from Libya, 
and one a piece from Kenya, Morocco and Somalia.

Two
are now dead â€” one by suicide, the other by heart attack, meaning that 
there are 46 on the list who are still alive at the controversial base.

Of those 46, The Herald reports that 
Fawzi al Odah, Fayez al Kandari and Abdal Malik Wahab are all 
participating in the ongoing hunger strike and have been force-fed by 
guards.

The Wall Street Journal identified five men as indefitine detainees, though it is not clear what acts of terrorism they are linked to or involved with.

Those men are named Mullah Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mohammed Nabi, Khairullah Khairkhwa, and Abdul Haq Wasiq.

There are a total of 166 prisoners at Guantanamo.

The government has said it wants to release or transfer the remaining prisoners to their homelands or other countries pending adequate security safeguards to prevent the men from attacking the U.S. or its allies.
