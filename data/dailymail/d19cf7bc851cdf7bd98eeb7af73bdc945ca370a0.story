Britain could have its first true taste of spring this weekend as parts of the country experience temperatures warmer than Ibiza, and the first batch of British-grown strawberries hit the shelves.

London and parts of Devon could hit 18C over the weekend, while the famous Balearic party island, as well as inland hotspots including Madrird, are expected to be just 16C.

According to forecasters, the warm weather will continue tomorrow morning, with waves of sunshine working their way up from the south.

The rise in temperatures, which will be accompanied by dry and still weather, is expected to bring a welcome change across the country after an unrelentingly damp winter.

Forecasters at the MeteoGroup are predicting highs of 18C in London for Sunday. Forecaster Andy Ratcliffe said: 'England and Wales in general will be fine and warm with sunny spells. It will be cloudier in the Northwest, Scotland and Ireland.'

Temperatures have been steadily increasing over the past days, with the year's highest - 16.7C in Heathrow - recorded this afternoon.

A wave of high pressure across the southern England has sent sun-revellers into the shops with John Lewis reporting an 11 per cent increase in the sales of barbecues this week.

Shops have also reported a spike in barbecue sales in anticipation of of the warmer temperatures. Retailer John Lewis has sent extra stocks of barbecues in its department stores to prepare for the weekend.

It has seen online sales of barbecues increase by 11 per cent this week, compared to the same time last year, with other outdoor essentials also performing well.

Sales of planters are up by 67 per 
cent compared to last year, while demand for garden tools has increased 
by more than 400 per cent, with green-fingered Brits keen to make the 
most of the sunshine.

Nicola
 Gidlow, outdoor living buyer at John Lewis, said: 'After a wet and 
miserable winter it looks as though spring may have arrived earlier than
 expected.

Tomorrow will bring a wave of mild 
and settled weather across the country, with the peak temperature to be 
found in Devon and built-up areas around London. North Devon, Heathrow 
and Norwich in Norfolk were all tipped by the Met Office to experience 
the peak 17C temperature, with lower highs across the rest of the 
country:

Scotland: 13CNorthern Ireland: 14CNorth of England: 13CMidlands: 14CEast Anglia: 14CWales: 14CSouthern England: 16CLondon: 17-18C

'Last March
 we still had snow on the ground across much of the UK, so this year 
Brits are understandably keen to make the most of the warm weather by 
getting their grills going.'

A spokesman for the Met Office said: 
'We're going to see progressively drier and more settled weather over 
the weekend, continuing for a couple of weeks.

'Saturday will have a dull start, put sunshine will come up from the south, spreading across the country by mid-afternoon.

'An
 area of high pressure sitting over the UK should mean really good 
weather up until Wednesday, and early indications are that it will 
continue for some time.

'Although temperature will be mild, the air will be very settled, so you won't have that chill from the wind. People will feel warmer because it had been so wet over the whole winter, which can make it feel colder.'

Although the temperatures nationwide will be a far cry from the March weather record - a reading of 25.6C in Cambridgeshire from 1968 - they are still several degrees in excess of the average.

The happy predictions come as Tesco announces that its first English strawberries will be on sale tomorrow thanks to an early harvest because of the unseasonal warmth.

The supermarket said that fruit from Chichester, West Sussex, will be sold from tomorrow - a week earlier than usual.

Strawberry buyer Simon Mandelbaum said: 'We are a nation of strawberry-lovers who cannot get our hands on the English crop quick enough and this year will be no exception - we are expecting a mad rush.

'Good levels of sunshine and unseasonably warm weather so far in March have been key for our growers, giving them an early crop.'

The high pressure system set to send good weather our way is currently settled over France, where beach-goers have been enjoying temperatures in excess of 19C.

The beach at Nice was packed as sun-seekers looked out over the clear blue waters, with some giving their bikinis the first outing of the year.
