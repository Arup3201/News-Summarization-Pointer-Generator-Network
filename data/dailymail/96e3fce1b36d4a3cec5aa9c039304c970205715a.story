Conservative pundit Meghan McCain, 29, only moved to L.A. in April after growing up in New York and says she has no plans to move back east just yet

The daughter of former Republican presidential nominee John McCain is adamant she isn’t about to join daytime chat show The View and instead is too busy enjoying the new life she has made for herself in Los Angeles, including a new job and settling into a fabulous new apartment that she has just had decorated.

Conservative pundit Meghan McCain, 29, impressed producers on the New York-based chat show that is currently down a couple of presenters after appearing as a guest co-host last month.

However McCain, who only moved to L.A. in April after growing up in New York says she has no plans to move back east just yet.

Particularly since McCain has landed herself a job as the cohost of Pivot's nightly show TakePart Live.

‘I
 have the most utmost respect for everyone at The View. The show was 
amazing for my career for a long time. But, right now, I really love my 
job at TakePart Live,’ she told Refinery 29.

Takepart
 Live is a nightly, interactive news show aimed at millennials and 
McCain says she much prefers it to working on the cable news channels. 

'I don’t want to be part of making America more sided. It’s just not my personality; it’s not who I am and what I believe in,' she said.

Another good reason to stay in L.A. for the time being is the amazing apartment which McCain has had specially decorated for her by a friend

'I don’t want to think that just because you’re on the left you can’t find something in common with the right. Our country is still so divided in so many ways.'

Despite initial fears that she might feel out of place as a Republican in L.A., McCain has no regrets about her move cross country.   

Another good reason to stay in L.A. for the time being is the amazing apartment which she has had specially decorated for her by a friend.

‘My best friend from high school is an interior designer, and I literally said, “I want my apartment to be a little Graceland and a little Scarface and a little Goldie Hawn in the ’70s, and you do whatever you want."'

McCain's best friend from high school is an interior designer and so she told her: 'I want my apartment to be a little Graceland and a little Scarface and a little Goldie Hawn in the '70s, and you do whatever you want'

McCain says she absolutely loves it. 'I feel like I have a big-girl apartment now,’ she said.

Since moving to L.A., McCain has also been appointed to GLAAD's national board of directors, a posting which she describes as an honor.

‘I’m
 a straight Republican and to be a member of the board and to show my 
people the fight for marriage equality and LGBT rights is universal and 
it goes beyond politics,' she said.

Politically, McCain describes herself as a ‘socially liberal Republican’

She defines that as someone who doesn't want to focus as much on social issues and what people do in their bedrooms and with their bodies.

‘I’m much more interested in what we’re doing fiscally as a country and national defense and how our government is run,' said the senator's daughter who has turned the blog she penned documenting her father’s 2008 presidential bid into a blossoming media career, which includes the campaign memoir Dirty Sexy Politics.
