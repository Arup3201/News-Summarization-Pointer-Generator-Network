The judge in the murder trial of Etan Patz today refused to release the man accused of killing the six-year-old after the prosecution reminded him of the brutal crime he confessed to.

Pedro Hernandez, from New Jersey, appeared in court today, where his lawyer asked that he be released from jail immediately due to the slow-moving case and lack of evidence against his client.

But the prosecution asked that this request be denied, reminding the court: 'Let's remember he killed a six-year-old child.'

Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley said that due to Hernandez's mental state, he would remain in prison until the trial, which is due to begin in Spring 2014.

Hernandez, who was led into the court handcuffed by police, said nothing during the short hearing.

His lawyer Harvey Fishbein expressed 
his frustration at the speed at which the case was moving, 
referring to it as Groundhog Day, and accused the prosecution of dragging their feet while his client is languishing in jail, where he has been since May 2012.

Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said prosecutors were moving as fast as they could.

Fishbein has always maintained that Hernandez is schizophrenic and bipolar, and that his admission was 
false, peppered with questionable claims and made after almost seven 
hours of police questioning.

Hernandez has entered a not guilty plea in the case.

Etan vanished on May 25, 1979. The anniversary was later named National Missing Children's Day in his memory. He became one of the first vanished children pictured on a milk carton.

Hernandez was arrested last May after
 police got a tip that he'd told people years before that he had killed a
 child in New York City.

He then told authorities he'd seen 
Etan at the bus stop, offered the boy a soda to entice him to a corner 
store where he worked and choked the boy in the basement.

Hernandez said he tossed Etan's book 
bag behind a basement freezer, put his limp body in a box and left it 
with some trash about a block away.

No body or bag has ever been found.

Under New York law, a person can be 
convicted based only on a confession if there's additional evidence that
 a crime was committed.

'The evidence before the grand jury 
(that indicted Hernandez) amply supports the offenses charged,' 
prosecutors wrote in a filing this winter.
