Wet bandit: Jennifer Burgess, 24, was arrested on Tuesday after allegedly found showering in a man's home and attempting to make off with his belongings

A man who returned home to find a naked woman greeting him at his front door says she was homeless and caught in the act of using his shower.

Randy Kizer said he was walking up to his front steps in Sacramento, California on Tuesday when 24-year-old Jennifer Burgess exited his front door, hair wet and wearing his son's army green bathrobe.

'She answers my front door and she goes, "I can explain,' Mr Kizer told Fox40.

Mr Kizer said he didn't dare follow the woman inside his home when she asked to go change - which he said he eagerly hoped she would do - instead fearing there could be more intruders inside.

'I go, "Are you homeless?" and she goes, "Yeah,"' Mr Kizer mimicked the young woman with a hesitant voice.

Later showing a CBS news reporter around the bathroom she used, including the camouflage-coloured bath robe and a bar of soap, he said: 'It was like I was intruding into her home, not the other way around.'

After allowing the woman to return from dressing, Mr Kizer said he noticed she had pockets that appeared quite swollen on her.

With police at the scene cuffing Burgees, they discovered she had planned to walk away with a bit more than some wet hair.

In addition to taking every spare key
in his house, including his car and house keys, she had also emptied 
his children's piggy banks he said.

'The kidsâ€™ allowance money and stuff had all been taken,' he told CBS Sacramento. 'My daughter was real upset that her (money) for church had all been taken.'

In all $46 dollars was taken according to Mr Kizer.

Adding to his discomfort, he believes the woman had been there possibly a few times before, despite her denial. He uses his dogs' calm demeanour around her as an example.

No stranger: Because both of his dogs, pictured, also appeared surprisingly calm around Burgess, the homeowner feared she had been there more than once before

'One of the dogs was lying on the floor here and this is the dog that jumps on everyone,' he told Fox40.

'It's very creepy. We had just bought video security, not installed yet. It is now,' he said.

Burgess was arrested and booked in the Sacramento County Jail for burglary according to Sgt Jason Ramos.

Her bail has been set at $50,000.
