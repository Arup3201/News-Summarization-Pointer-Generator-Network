Revealing images have shown Amanda Knox confidently preparing to face the world - and her critics - ahead of her appearance on Good Morning America today - her first ever live interview.

Photographs show Knox, wearing a floral shirt and khaki trousers, smiling as she is pampered by makeup artists, while later images show her timidly leaving the studio after the emotional interview.

When on air, she made a tearful plea to the family of the roommate she was acquitted of murdering - Meredith Kercher - saying: 'I really hope we can connect one day.'

Knox said she hopes the Kercher family will read her new book detailing her experiences in the aftermath of the slaying in November 2007 - even though they have said they will not.

Getting ready: Amanda Knox appears relaxed ahead of her appearance on Good Morning America on Wednesday

'Meredith Kercher is the victim, Meredith Kercher died,' Knox said, struggling to contain her emotions. 'Her family deserved answers; the prosecution didn't give that to them.

'I still hope they'll read my book because in it I talk about Meredith, I talk about the relationship I had with her - and that is the little amount I can give them of her.

'They're seeking answers and they 
deserve to have answers. I give every answer I can in my book. It's the 
first thing I can give to them... I really hope we can connect one day.'

The book, which she claims reveals 
her side of the story while earning her a reported 
$4 million pay, has been rejected by the Kercher family.

Apprehensive: When Knox is seen outside the studio in New York City, she appears more timid

'We're not interested in this book, 
just like we weren't interested in the others about the case, and we 
won't read it,' Meredith's sister Stephanie Kercher said after its U.S. 
release on Monday.

'Meredith is the victim in this tragic case,' she added.

In
the Good Morning America interview, Knox told Robin Roberts that she 
was grateful for the opportunity to share her experiences in the memoir,
which is entitled 'Waiting to be Heard'.

'I wanted people to know who I was 
because I felt as if I was lost in the middle of this storm,' she said. 
'I was taken over. I wanted people to know precisely what I was 
thinking.'

She added that her identity was lost 
in the media frenzy after Kercher was found murdered at their apartment 
in Perugia, Italy in 2007.

Knox's seemingly bizarre behavior - joking around and kissing her Italian boyfriend Raffaele 
Sollecito, who was also convicted of the murder before he was acquitted - made her prime suspect.

In the interview on GMA, she attempted to defend her actions.

'It's
the greatest hurdle that I've had to come across in defending myself,' 
she said. 'Until you're in a situation that is as incredible, surreal 
and overwhelming and tragic that I was...

'I
had to learn how to deal with it. I was 20, I was in a foreign country,
I barely spoke the language and my friend was murdered and I'd never in
my life experienced anything like that.

'I was clueless all the way through. I had to learn how to survive.'

She also touched upon her odd behavior in an exclusive interview with Diana Sawyer, which aired on ABC News on Tuesday evening.

Emotional: Amanda Knox appeared on Good Morning America on Wednesday and said she hopes that the family of her murdered roommate, Meredith Kercher, will read her newly-released book

Story: She told Robin Roberts the book gives her a chance to explain her relationship with Meredith

'I think that everyone’s reaction to something horrible is different,' Knox said. 'I was stunned by her death, completely bowled over because it was unfair. She was my friend, and I lost a friend.'

But she admitted: 'I could have been more sensitive.'

In
the interview, Knox 
said she was now considering returning to Italy for the trial. But she 
said the prospect of the case made her feel as if she had 'another field
of barbed wire to crawl through.'

And asked of those who have called her a 'she-devil,' a sexual 
thrill-seeker and a seductress, she firmly defended herself saying: 'They're wrong.'

Knox also opened up about the first time she met Kercher when they moved in together.

'I
was putting away my things in the room when she came to my room and 
introduced herself,' Knox said, adding that she thought: 'Wow, this is someone who, who I can get along with.'

Others have contrasted that Kercher found Knox's loudness and lack of ambition annoying.

'It bothers me when people suggest that she wasn’t my friend,' Knox said of their relationship.

On November 1, 2007, the bloody body of Kercher was found after sustaining 47 wounds including a fatal slash across her 
throat.

Knox says she was never at home when it happened but was at the apartment of her boyfriend of one week, Sollecito. She says the two of them had sex, watched a movie, stayed up late talking.

The next morning she says she left Sollecito's apartment to return to her own for a change of clothes. Once inside she saw blood in the bathroom sink but went ahead and took a shower anyway.

'I
thought it was strange,' she admits but defends that she didn’t know 
how to react to it all - 
and believed it had to be all innocent. She then went to Sollecito's apartment for breakfast.

Defense: In an emotional interview with Diana 
Sawyer, which aired on Tuesday night, Knox said she was upset about how 
she had been branded in the aftermath of her roommate's murder

At
the crime scene, Knox says she heard something about a ‘foot’ spoken by
investigators in Italian. Her curiosity soon escalated into fear as her
understanding of their conversation advanced.

‘There was blood and there was a blanket,’ she recalled police saying that day.

‘My
friend had been murdered and it could have just as easily been me. 
Somehow she had died in the house where we were living and it could have
been me,’ Knox said of her initial fears.

Knox was taken to jail and accused of Kercher's murder, which she denied.

Investigators
suggested that she may have had amnesia from so much trauma she had 
experienced.

When her local boss and boyfriend opened up to 
investigators about what may have happened, suggesting Knox may in fact 
have played a role, Knox says it had a dramatic effect on her defense.

At the scene: Knox says that on the morning she found Miss Kercher's body she was returning from Sollecito's apartment and entered the crime scene while ignoring the blood found on her bathroom sink as nothing serious

‘I,
I can only describe it as breaking down. I didn’t know what I 
remembered and what I didn’t remember anymore,’ she defends of her then 
admission to Kercher’s murder while behind bars.

Of the confession she signed, she says: ‘I signed it because I was incredibly vulnerable at the time.’

Despite not one trace of Knox’s DNA found at the crime scene, she was found guilty of murder. Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito received 25 years.

Behind bars she says she considered cutting her wrists or swallowing bleach to end her life. She says she would sing the Star Spangled Banner and prayed to stay positive.

But in 2011 her murder conviction was overturned.

In an earlier interview with USA
Today, Knox issued a plea to be one day 'allowed' to visit the cemetery in Mitcham, 
south London that holds Kercher's body.

Amanda Knox and then boyfriend Sollecito spent four years in jail until their convictions for Ms Kercher's death were overturned

'I really want to go see her grave,' 
said Knox. 'And right now I don’t feel like I have the right to without 
her family’s permission. So that’s something that I want to work toward 
to get closure.'

Kercher's 
family has publicly maintained their own personal conviction in Knox's 
involvement in the murder and in a statement released early Tuesday 
reminded that she could still be found guilty.

'The Italian legal system still has 
an appeal procedure under way and so the case is returning to a new 
court hearing. The sentence can still be overturned,' said Meredith's sister 
Stephanie Kercher.

Following Knox's and Sollecito's release from prison, 
Sollecito moved to Switzerland while she returned to Seattle to finish 
her creative writing degree at the University of Washington.

A
third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found 
all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence for Miss 
Kercher’s murder.
