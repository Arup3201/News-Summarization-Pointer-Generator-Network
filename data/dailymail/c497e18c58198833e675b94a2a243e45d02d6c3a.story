With Halloween approaching, this rare rodent appears to have already got into costume as the ghost squirrel.

The bizarrely hued critter is an albino meaning it lacks the pigment in its fur and so appears completely white.

The shocking discovery was made by Severn Trent Water ranger Thomas Crawford as he surveyed Draycote Water, near Rugby, Warwickshire.

Thomas said: 'We've been all of a flutter since the ghostly white squirrel was spotted at Draycote Water.

'Visitors were reporting sightings of the albino rodent, but as with spectres it was proving difficult to capture on camera.

'Because of its white colouring it does standout against the autumnal colours here, but it moves so fast, photographing it was very difficult.

'Just before Halloween, we can't believe that this rare rodent has made Draycote Water its new haunt.

'We hope that it will stay around for the half term holidays so that all of the local children can have a chance to see it.'

The albino grey squirrel is one of just 50 thought to be alive in the UK.

More usual colour: The grey squirrel (seen here in Cannon Hill Park, Edgbaston, Birmingham) is a recognisable critter in the country's parks

Albino animals are a rare occurence but some have become popular as pets.

Albino hedgehogs, rabbits and even snakes have all been photographed.

Albinism is caused by a recessive gene and in the animal kingdom, an albino animal can be in danger as it doesn't have protective camouflage.

No camouflage: Albie the Albino hedgehog was found on the side of the road in Cloneen near Feathard Co Tipperary. His white spikes leave him vulnerable to predators

Rare: This albino Burmese Python was the first to be bred in Zagreb, Croatia
