Neil Adams was full of praise for striker Cameron Jerome after his brace sent Norwich top of The SkyBet Championship.

Jerome - who made his first start of the season after his move from Stoke - scored two goals in the second half after Alex Tettey gave Norwich the lead against a spirited Brentford side.

Norwich had John Ruddy to thank for keeping his side in the game and Tettey and Jerome made no mistake at the other end.

Match Ratings from JAMES ANDREW at Griffin Park 

Tettey finished off a good team move to lift the ball over David Button and then Jerome wrapped up the points with a diving header and an excellent strike from the edge of the area.

Adams said: ‘Cameron scored two fabulous goals. The second was an excellent strike, it was unsaveable.

‘You have to start well in this division. You have to make sure you go about your business and we’ve been delighted with how we’ve started.

‘It is fantastic for us to be top of the league, it may only be for 24 hours, nothing is handed out in September, but I would rather than be there than not be.’

But Brentford boss Mark Warburton was raging at referee Tim Robinson not to award his side a penalty when Alex Prichard was brought down in the box by Jos Hooiveld.

Norwich then broke away and scored their second and Warburton called it the turning point of the game.

He said: ‘I thought should have had a penalty. I’m disappointed as it changed the entire course of game. If it’s not a penalty then book our player. That doesn't happen. That to me was a shocking decision which changed the game.

‘If I am the only one who thinks that is a penalty then I need to go to Specsavers.’

Adams said: ‘Your heart’s in your mouth when a player goes down in the box. I looked to the referee straight away. Luckily enough it wasn’t given. Our players didn’t think it was.’

Brentford had been the better side up until the first goal and had three excellent chances to take the lead before the break.

Moses Odubajo crossed for Andre Gray who turned brilliantly on the edge of the six yard box and fired just wide of Ruddy’s goal and Gray was then denied by the outstretched leg of Jos Hooiveld.

And on the stroke of half time Ruddy pulled off a stunning one handed save to deny Alan McCormack’s 30 yard piledriver.

Bradley Johnson had two good chances to give the visitors the lead at the start of the second half, but he fired his first shot over the bar after good work by Jerome.

And then dragged his shot wide after a mazy run through the Brentford defence.

Ruddy was again forced into action as he tipped Alan Judge’s shot round the post just after the hour mark.

But Norwich were able to keep them out and then Tettey put his side ahead shortly after the hour mark and then Jerome met Steven Whittaker's cross to head home at the far post before his spectacular second to earn Adams' side all three points.

And Adams added: ‘We scored three goals which is probably a bit unfair. People will probably think Brentford have been battered. But they haven’t’
