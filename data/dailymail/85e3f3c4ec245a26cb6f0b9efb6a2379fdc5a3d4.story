As the wedding vows say, they agree to build a life together ‘for richer, for poorer’.

But just how rich or poor seems to be a secret among couples – with women the worse offenders for keeping their partners in the dark.

A report reveals that one in ten people fail to tell their loved ones about all of their savings, while 63 per cent of couples’ savings are kept in separate bank accounts.

Stash: One in ten people hide money from their partners - and women are the worst culprits, a survey found

The average hidden stash is around £1,300 – an increase of 9 per cent since last year – meaning that Britons are furtively hoarding some £3billion all together.

And, according to the research by Lloyds Bank, one in eight women admitted concealing money from their partner, compared with one in ten men.

The typical female had a stash of £1,400, while men’s hidden savings were around £1,100. Men were also more likely to exaggerate their savings than women, with 5 per cent telling partners they had more put away than they did.

The research also found that among those who shared a joint savings accounts, one in ten said their other half would not have to ask before dipping in – but the limit to take without permission was £286.

Philip Robinson from Lloyds Bank said: ‘The number of couples keeping savings secret is on the rise with the UK’s hidden savings pot growing to just over £3billion.

‘However it is worth considering pooling funds between partners as combined savings could provide greater returns on interest.’

The survey of 2,000 adults also found a marked contrast in how different generations approached their banking.

Younger couples were more likely to have independent accounts, with 82 per cent of under-25s saving separately – up from 80 per cent in 2013. This compares to just half of couples who are over 55.

The Lloyds spokesman said they did not know why more people were keeping their savings separate – or even secret – as the economy started to improve.

However Anna Bowes, from the Savings Champion website, said many couples save independently to ensure they are both entitled to an ISA account – in which they can each put £15,000 a year.

A separate report yesterday found savings among the over-55s had risen by £10,000 in the last three years.

The research by Aviva insurance also found that average mortgage debt among older people has fallen to £59,000, compared with £64,000 in 2011.
