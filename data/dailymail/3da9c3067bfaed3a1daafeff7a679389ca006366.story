Smartphones are being turned into ‘pocket doctors’ capable of spotting Parkinson’s disease.

The popular devices come equipped with technology needed to record speech and movement – both of which are eroded by the condition, Britain’s biggest science conference heard.

The information can then be analysed and, it is hoped, used to diagnose the disease earlier and more accurately. More prompt treatment should improve quality of life.

A patient’s symptoms could also be tracked over time, ‘revolutionising’ treatment by allowing doctors to adjust drug dosage as needed.

More studies are needed but British researchers have already shown they distinguish Parkinson’s patients from healthy people with almost 100 per cent accuracy – and they are in negotiation about using the technology on the NHS.

Some 127,000 Britons suffer from Parkinson’s but with diagnosis based on symptoms, it is often not confirmed until relatively late.

Once it is diagnosed, fluctuations in the severity of symptoms make it difficult adjust drug doses.

High-profile sufferers include Michael J Fox, who was just 30 when he was diagnosed with the condition, and Muhammad Ali.

Comedian Robin Williams was in the early stages of Parkinson’s when he died last month.

Symptoms include tremors, stiffness and a gradual slowing down of the body. As more and more brain cells die, speech and balance can be affected and some sufferers become wheelchair-bound.

There is no cure but early treatment improves quality of life.

The ‘pocket doctor’, unveiled at the British Science Festival in Birmingham, is simply a normal smartphone.

Aston University mathematician Dr Max Little has shown it is possible to use voice recordings to spot Parkinson’s with 99 per cent accuracy. 

Give-aways include soft, breathy speech and a tremor to the voice.

The team has also used the phone’s accelerometer - the inbuilt motion sensor that ensures the information on the screen faces the right way – to log movement. This is important, as Parkinson’s patients often freeze while walking.

Dr Little told the British Science Festival in Birmingham: ‘We have been able to show that if someone puts the smartphone in their pocket and walks forward 20 paces and back we can get very high accuracy – around 98 per cent or so – in detecting whether someone has Parkinson’s.’ 

The actor Robin Williams, 63, pictured in July this year, was also in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The scientists behind the new app say voice recordings can diagnose the disease with 99 per cent accuracy

He hopes that if he can study enough people, it will eventually be possible to detect the disease in its early stages.

Dr Little said: ‘We don’t know how to diagnose the disease until in essence it is too late. If we could get an advantage of even five years, that would be great.’

Possibilities range from a program that is only used by doctors to an app that the general public can use, although the ethics of this would have to be examined.

It is hoped the gadgetry found in smartphones could also be used to help spot other conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety and depression.

Claire Bale of charity Parkinson’s UK, which is helping fund Dr Little’s work, said: ‘This research is a welcome step forward. 

'Parkinson’s is a very complex and fluctuating condition – so effectively managing it is a real challenge.

‘Smartphones offer huge potential as they continuously capture information, and can monitor subtle changes - such as an increase or decrease in someone’s tremor.

‘Arming doctors and people with Parkinson’s with this technology could revolutionise the way the condition is managed.'
