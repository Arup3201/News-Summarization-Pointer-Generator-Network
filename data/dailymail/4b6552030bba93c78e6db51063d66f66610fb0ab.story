Morgan Schneiderlin's second-half absence proved to be extremely costly to his side's hopes of maintaining their impressive run as his replacement Maya Yoshida and Victor Wanyama failed to deal with Manchester City's runners.

Manchester City's opening goal was fortuitous as Schneiderlin may have been in a better position to block Yaya Toure's shot had he not picked up a knock before the interval.

Both Ronald Koeman and his players will be hoping the France international is fit for Southampton's next two fixtures against Arsenal and Manchester United.

Saints boss Ronald Koeman will be hoping Schneiderlin is back in time to face Arsenal and Manchester United

Saints are clearly at their best when Schneiderlin, who Koeman forced to stay at the club following a mass summer exodus at St Mary's, is dictating play from his side's engine room.

Southampton boss Koeman came into his side's Premier League encounter against Manchester City brimming with confidence having led his side to second spot after 12 games.

The Dutchman said he had not 'seen one team better than us' throughout his first few months in England but that claim is no longer relevant after Sunday's result.

Koeman will be extremely disappointed that his side were beaten by a Toure goal, which was deflected into Fraser Forster's net, and late strikes by Frank Lampard and Gael Clichy.

The home side rarely tested Joe Hart but they also managed to keep Manuel Pellegrini's side at bay for the first 75 minutes.

Substitute Maya Yoshida failed to close down Frank Lampard for Manchester City's second goal

Southampton's back line, which was made up of Jose Fonte, Toby Alderweireld, Nathaniel Clyne and Ryan Bertrand, stood firm to minimise the visitors' threat at goal until they went in search of an all-important equaliser.

Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero was denied a stonewall penalty by referee Mike Jones in the first half - but he rarely had a sniff at goal other than in the 84th minute when Southampton were hit on the counter attack.

The biggest negative for Southampton was that they lacked creativity to unlock City's shaky defence - even when Eliaquim Mangala was shown a second yellow card in the 74th minute for a reckless challenge on substitute Shane Long.

Lampard and Clichy managed to put the game to bed when Southampton were on the lookout for a goal but again Koeman's midfield failed to track City's runners from deep.

The Premier League fixture computer has been unkind to Southampton in making the south coast side face Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United in quick succession - but it also provides Koeman's side the chance to prove their manager was right in suggesting they can go toe-to-toe with the big boys.
