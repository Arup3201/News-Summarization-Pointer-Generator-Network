He was listed in critical condition.

His parents, Robbie and Patricia, rushed in from another area of Florida where they were vacationing to be at his side.

They told local media that Sanghwan was a good student who had recently been accepted to medical school.

His father added: 'He came [to Miami] to have fun and this kind of thing happens... It's unreal.'

After the incident, police found Bennett's car in the parking lot at Tootsie's Cabaret.

According to an arrest report, she turned herself in on Monday at the office of lawyer Gerald Tobin but couldn't prove she had a valid driver’s license.

However, she was released from jail on Tuesday after posting a $12,500 bond.

The hit-and-run case remains under investigation.
