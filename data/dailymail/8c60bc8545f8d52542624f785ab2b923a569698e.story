Brazil legend Ronaldo is moving to Britain to become a student.

The World Cup winner will come to live in London next month and plans to study advertising, according to Brazil's Veja magazine.

It is believed the former Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid striker will stay for at least two years and take up a work placement with London-based communications company WPP, under the guidance of Sir Martin Sorrell.Â 

Highlight: Ronaldo scored twice in the 2002 World Cup final - now he's going back to the books

Ronaldo called time on his playing 
career in 2011 after a spell with Corinthians and has run his own sports
marketing agency 9ine for the past two years.

He also turned out for Cruzeiro, PSV Eindhoven and AC Milan and lifted the World Cup in the Far East in 2002, scoring twice in the final against Germany.

The star, who has houses in Sao Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro and a private island off the Rio coast, is also on 
the organising committees for the 2014 Brazil World Cup and the 2016 Rio
Olympics.

His spokesman recently confirmed Ronaldo's plans to learn the tricks of the trade with WPP's founder Sorrell.

He said: 'He intends to go to 
England, which he will receive advice and guidance from Mr Sorrell, 
who's the head of the world's largest advertising company.'

WPP is the world's largest communications services group, employing 162,000 people, in 3,000 offices in 110 countries.

Guidance: Ronaldo will have a work placement with Sir Martin Sorrell

Multi-millionaire Sir Martin built the business up after taking a stake in Wire and Plastic Products Plc in 1985 and transforming it into an international communications group.

The company moved its headquarters to Dublin in 2008 but announced last month that it will now pay its taxes in Britain from January 2 this year.

Ronaldo, 36, said in an interview that he could not wait to become a student again.

He told Brazil's Meio e Mensagem newspaper: 'Eighteen years have passed and I've hardly studied at all. I feel a great need to become a student again.

'I've learned a lot in life, travelling, living abroad, just in the school of life.

'But I also have to immerse myself in something. Learning from Martin Sorrell will be perfect.

'I won't leave him alone, I'll be asking him questions the whole day, just like a striker. He's going to have to tell me everything.'
