A toddler battling leukaemia who nearly died after his lungs collapsed during life-saving treatment has defied the odds to survive.

J’ssiah Brown's mother claims doctors told her the chances of him surviving were a million to one.

Jeanene Walters had been told to prepare for the worst after the two-year-old had to be put into an induced coma following a bone marrow transplant when his lungs collapsed and his liver failed.

But after three weeks on life support, J’ssiah stunned everyone by pulling through.

He is now recovering from the life-saving surgery with his mother and six-year-old brother Kyerell - who donated the bone marrow that saved his life.

Ms Walters said: 'We were so happy when we found out Kyerell was a match and wanted to help his brother.

'But shortly after the surgery, J’ssiah started struggling to breathe, and everyone was rushing round him.

'I was told they would have to put him in an induced coma to give him any chance of survival. He would have taken his last breath otherwise.

'But even though everybody thought he wouldn’t get out of it, I knew he would.

'I asked him if he was tired and he told me he was. He nodded and said "yes’".

'I said to him: "The doctors are going to put you to sleep but you have to keep fighting - you have to remember to wake up, OK?" 'He nodded yes as if he knew. 

'He was fighting so much when they tried to put him to sleep. The doctors were happy about that and I was ecstatic.

'He was fighting and fighting. The nurses said they’ve never seen someone have this transplant and come off the machine.

'At first, they told me that things 
looked bad, but he was on life support and just kept going. They told me
 the chance of him coming out of the coma was one in a million.

'But after a while, they said to me "I don’t know what it is, mum, if it’s you being here 24/7 or this book" - because I had the Bible with me. They said it’s actually a miracle.

'The journey that he has been through and seeing it firsthand, I just put my hands up to him. He has made me such a proud mum.'

J’ssiah was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer - acute myeloid leukaemia - in June 2013, when he was just one.

The toddler underwent several rounds of gruelling chemotherapy but the cancer remained.

When six-year-old Kyerell proved to a transplant match for J’ssiah, he immediately offered to undergo surgery to save his baby brother’s life.

J’ssiah’s mixed heritage - a combination of Indian, Chinese and Caribbean - meant he had very little chance of securing a transplant from anywhere else.

Staff at the Royal Marsden Hospital have praised J'ssiah's cheerful nature

His mother said: 'It was such a relief when Kye was a match. Without that, we would have been looking forever.

'He was so brave - he just wants his brother home.'

A spokesman for The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust’s Bone Marrow Transplant team said: 'J’ssiah is a delightful two-year-old boy who has a particularly aggressive form of acute myeloid leukaemia.

'He was first diagnosed with AML in July last year, but sadly his leukaemia came back two months after finishing standard chemotherapy treatment.

'His only good chance for cure was to have a bone marrow transplant and fortunately for him, his older brother was a perfect match.'

He added that J’ssiah’s bone marrow transplant is working but there have been some complications.

'Unfortunately due to a number of complications, he has needed to make several visits to various hospitals for specialist care.

'But, despite all this, J’ssiah has remained his usual cheerful self, who brings a smile to everyone he meets.'

Cancer charity African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT) has set up a JustGiving page to raise money and send J’ssiah and his family on a special trip.

The charity’s co-founder Beverley De-Gale said: 'To be able to arrange an all-expenses paid trip for two-year-old J’ssiah, in order to give him a break from his world of treatment and therapy, would be wonderful treat for J’ssiah and his sibling.

'The bravery of J’ssiah and his brother should be celebrated.'
