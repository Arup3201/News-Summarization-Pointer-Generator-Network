It was a grisly scene that brought an abrupt end to the rural tranquillity of the morning bus ride.Passengers watched as a pack of hounds chased a fox out of a forest and tore it to pieces in the road.

Up to ten hunting dogs savaged the animal on the edge of a lay-by, although a bus traveller who took this image of the attack said a hound also died when it was struck by a car.

Yesterday police were investigating the circumstances surrounding the fox’s death as local hunt organisers distanced themselves from the incident.

The hounds pounced on the fox on the A40 in the village of Abergwili near Carmarthen, South-West Wales.

Killing: The exhausted fox had been chased across country when it ran onto the road - where the ten hounds pounced

Hunt: Martin Walters (centre) a master of the Carmarthenshire Hunt, which has denied being involved with the dogs

It came to light after the unidentified bus passenger posted images – taken by mobile phone – on Facebook.

The passenger wrote: ‘This morning on the A40 just coming out of 
Abergwili a group of hunting dogs came running down from the forest on 
the hill on to the busy road with a fox and started tearing it to 
pieces. One of the dogs was hit and killed by a car in the process and 
it was one of the most horrible things to experience.’

Police are studying CCTV from a security camera mounted on the front of 
the bus. The local Carmarthenshire Hunt denied responsibility. Joint 
huntmaster Martin Walters said: ‘Our hounds were 20 miles away in the 
village of Pendine when this happened.

Ban: The Hunting Act 2004 made hunting with dogs illegal, although exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are all still legal. Pictured is Mr Walters (left) a master of a local Hunt

‘We are a registered pack and we are regularly monitored. We were being 
monitored by the National Trust on Saturday when this happened.’ Mr 
Walters added that unlicensed hunting with foxhounds went on in the 
area.

He said: ‘There are so many rebel packs at the moment. These hounds 
could have come in from anywhere with people hunting on foot.’ The 
Hunting Act 2004 made hunting with dogs a criminal offence, although 
exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be 
shot are legal. 
Animal rights campaigners claim loopholes in the law are continually being exploited.
