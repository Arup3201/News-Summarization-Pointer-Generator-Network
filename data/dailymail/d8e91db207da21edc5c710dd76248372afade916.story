Andy Murray's immediate reward for scoring his 500th career win on Tuesday night was to be presented with a giant green cake that would threaten to add a few inches to any man's waistline.

The deeper satisfaction will have been in passing a significant landmark that few manage, and it came with a hard-fought 6-4 3-6 6-3 win over South African Kevin Anderson that sees him into the last eight of the Miami Open.

He now faces Austria's 21 year-old world No 52 Dominic Thiem after becoming the 47th man to get 500 wins since the game went completely open to amateurs and professionals in 1968.

Haas - 561 

Berdych - 507 

Robredo - 505 

Murray - 500

That averages out at one per year and it is a fitting testament to Murray's admirable consistency at the top of the game. Only nine active players can claim the same distinction.

It was also a day notable for British tennis gaining a second, ready-made top 100 player, as Slovenian-born world No 83 Aljaz Bedene confirmed that he has received British citizenship and will be playing under the Union Jack.

After carefully managing not to take a bite from his garish acreage of confectionery Murray contemplated the feat and said, 'It's an amazing feeling, winning matches these days is extremely tough.

'It's very pleasing and not something I expected to do when I first came on tour. It's great to do it here in Miami where I spent a lot of time training and put in do a lot of the hard work.'

This has been a prosperous tournament for him, and it was a 25th victory at this Masters level event. There was plenty of high quality tennis as he just about defused the power of the giant South African world No 15, despite suffering a lull that saw him fall 0-4 behind in the second set.

He will soon be joined in the British ranks by 25 year-old Bedene, who since 2008 has lived in Welwyn Garden City with his girlfriend Kimalie, a pop star in her native land who is a protégée of renowned record producer Jeff Wayne.

Bedene attended a citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday and will formally receive his passport within the next two weeks and start entering tournaments as a British player.

However, whether he can play Davis Cup for GB is a different matter, as he has three times been in the Slovenian squad, albeit never having played a 'live' rubber. He is appealing a new rule banning players from representing two nations on the basis that his citizenship application was being processed when it was introduced.

Bedene is the most significant British tennis import since Greg Rusedski. An athletic and agile baseliner, he has already been ranked 71 in the world and after being held back by injuries last year ought to be heading into the top 50 before too long.

'This is something I have wanted since the moment I stepped foot in this beautiful country,' he said.

' I feel honoured to be able to compete under the Union Jack on the ATP Tour. Davis Cup is another dream and one I will have to fight for with everything I have.' He is unlikely to figure for GB in July's quarter final against France, especially after the heroics of James Ward against the USA. However, he would be a huge asset in any clay court ties.
