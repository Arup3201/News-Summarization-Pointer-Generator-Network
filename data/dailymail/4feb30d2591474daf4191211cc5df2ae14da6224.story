Taxi app Hailo is leaving America's shores in the face of competition from ridesharing services Uber and Lyft, the company announced Tuesday.

The company was founded in 2011 in London but struggled to gain a foothold in the United States against well-funded competitors.

The company also announced that founder Jay Bregman had left the company, though specific reasons for his departure were not given.

Fail: London-based Hailo is pulling out of the United States, where it worked hard to enter the New York taxi market while running up against well-funded competition and regulators

When Hailo waded into the crowded American market, the company was looking to distinguish itself by connecting users to yellow taxis instead of coordinating with livery cab drivers.

But The Verge reported that in New York the company faced a battle with the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which imposed service radius and payment process restrictions.

Breaking down the company's failure, Fortune said Hailo never had the numbers to make e-hailing taxis a reality.

Only a 'tiny fraction' of New York's 40,000 registered cab drivers signed up to work for the service, and cabbies said they were suspicious of the company.

Hailo also faced tough competitors such as Uber and Lyft, who are now mainly competing against each other by throwing their financial heft around.

CEO Tom Barr blamed the departure on the 'astronomical marketing' costs 'required to compete' against these companies.

'Profitability for any one player is almost impossible,' warned Barr. 

Hailo, which was funded to the tune of $100million, was facing off against Uber, who recently closed a round of financing at $1.2billion.

As for Bregman, he had been scheduled to speak at a tech conference in London before news of his departure.

Barr said that Bregman 'by his own admissions has taken the business to the level he can.'

Hailo will now turn its focus on the European and Asian markets, planning to expand next into Singapore.

Justin Raymond, formerly president of Hailo Canada, had announced he was trying to work out a licensing deal to continue the service in Toronto, according to TechCrunch, but the company said they would not be negotiating such a deal.
