A little girl who lost both of her feet after he father accidentally ran over her with a lawn mower has celebrated a happy milestone in her young life by having a princess party for her third birthday.

Ireland Nugent, who opted quickly for a Spiderman costume instead of a princess outfit, had to have her feet amputated following the April 11 accident, and now she is learning how to walk using prosthetic limbs.

'It's just not her birthday to us, it's just a celebration of being here,' her mother Nicole said to The Tampa Bay Times.

Birthday girl: Ireland Nugent, seen here with her cousin, celebrated her third birthday on Sunday, months after she had both her her feet amputated due to a lawn mower accident

Memorable moment: The birthday was a highlight for the Nugent family who has had a particularly tough year

'I think this is a day we will never forget.'

While the attention was focused on the celebration of her birthday this weekend- which included a princess-themed party- her health battles are far from over.

The Tampa Bay Times reports that on Thursday she will go under the knife with another surgery as doctors have to shave down a portion of her right leg.

Such a surgery may become a regular occurrence as they need to constantly adjust based on her growth.

Ireland apparently doesn't enjoy wearing her prosthetic limbs, saying that they hurt, but it doesn't hold her back as she moves around freely without the aides like she did at her Sunday birthday party.

Embracing the new: Ireland is said to be doing very well with her prosthetic legs, though she opts not to wear them sometimes because they hurt slightly

Different ways of getting around: The accident left her both knees but nothing below

Her recovery following the April accident when her father ran after Jerry as he rode a lawn mower up the driveway at their Palm Harbor home.

Her mother, Nicole Nugent, frantically motioned for him to stop, but he misunderstood, put the lawn mower in reverse and backed over the child.

The toddler's legs were severed below the knees and she had cuts to her hand. She also broke her thumb.

Experts were worried that the little girl might refuse to walk with her new prosthetic limbs, but the Tampa Bay Times reported that the girl has already become emotionally attached to the legs.

Days out: The little girl has embraced the changes in her abilities but will undergo more surgeries moving forward including one this week

Community effort: Supporters have raised $150,000 so far to help pay for her medical expenses

When the prosthetist said he would need the test limbs back during a June fitting, the little girl said she wanted to keep them.

The shocking case garnered national attention and photos of Ireland's bright smile warmed the hearts of thousands who followed her progress.

All told, $150,000 has been donated to the family in order to help pay for her medical bills.

'She will continue to succeed. She will do great things in her life,' her mother Nicole told reporters at a press conference in April. 'This will not stop Ireland.'

When she took her first post-operation steps in June, her father was brimming with pride after there were initial fears she may reject the prosthetics.

'She took it over the top ... She's not ever going to hold back,' he said.

'That's my superhero. That's my angel.'
