Too much: Ben got caught up in a 'hedonistic' party lifestyle in London

Police and a coroner have been accused of serious failings in their investigations into the death of a teenage boy allegedly groomed by a TV star.

Ben Cowburn was found dead in hospital after telling medical staff he had been raped by the celebrity, whose identity was covered up at the inquest into Ben’s death.

Now it can be revealed that the nurse who discovered his secret torment was never asked to give evidence to the jury, even though the fashion student’s family were desperate to hear from him.

The nurse says Ben told him he was raped by the comedian, and believed he was plied with drink and drugs to ensure he gave his  ‘consent’ for sex.

Although Scotland Yard claims to have carried out a full investigation, detectives did not even manage to access the tragic 18-year-old’s phone to look for text messages he received from his alleged abuser.

The TV comic himself was never questioned by police or the coroner and, when asked about his former friend this week,  replied: ‘Who’s Ben Cowburn?’

Last night there were calls for the Metropolitan Police to reopen its investigation into the sexual assaults allegedly suffered by Cornwall-born Ben during the year he spent caught up in a ‘hedonistic lifestyle’ in London.

An online petition has been launched calling on the Metropolitan Police to ‘investigate fully all the allegations’, and ‘at least interview’ the celebrity.

Critics said coroner Emma Carlyon should explain why she failed to approach key witnesses and why she agreed that the comic should only be called ‘Mr X’.

A friend of Ben said: ‘We’re very concerned that key witnesses were not contacted, and the police didn’t do a very good job.’

The court heard how Ben was ‘groomed’ by the comedian after moving from Truro to study at the London Fashion Retail Academy in September 2009, aged 17.

In July 2010 the comedian and Ben fell out and the teenager’s mental health quickly deteriorated. He returned to Truro but made a series of apparent suicide attempts and was admitted to Longreach House, a nearby mental health centre.

There he gradually revealed how the celebrity took him to drug-fuelled parties, leaving him feeling ‘dirty and used’.

On one occasion, he said, the older man climbed uninvited into his bed, engaging him in a sex act.

Another time Ben said he was persuaded to strip by a group of men and publicly fondled.

Ben was found dead in his room beside a plastic bag in December 2010. But after the eight-day hearing ended last Wednesday with an open verdict, Ben’s mother said the family had been ‘failed by the inquest process’ and suffered a ‘tragic injustice’.

In a joint statement with the rest of her family, Mrs Cowburn, 52, highlighted how ‘key members of Ben’s care team… were not available’ to the inquest.

They had asked to hear from a nurse whom Ben told about the alleged rape. However Gavin Simonsen-Kuhl was never called to give evidence. Family solicitor Rachel Heelis said: ‘He was one of the staff Ben felt he could talk to. We requested he attend the inquest but were told he was in Norway so couldn’t be called.’

The nurse was stunned to be told by this newspaper that he had been deemed ‘unavailable’.

Mr Simonsen-Kuhl, a 35-year-old former soldier, said he ‘found it really, really surprising’ not to be called, adding: ‘Ben told me he was raped in London. All the stuff that was going on in his head –  he was taken advantage of.’

He added: ‘You’ve got to take what he says until you can actually find out the truth. It’s a grey area in mental health, but for someone to go the way he did there has got to be some truth in what’s gone on.’ Told that the Metropolitan Police said there was no conclusive evidence of sexual assault he replied: ‘Why didn’t they go and look for it then?’

The Met’s DC David Gadsby told the inquest how Ben revealed his torment in a one-to-one conversation with Mr Simonsen-Kuhl in which the nurse ‘was quite sure the word rape was used’.

Ben had already described other traumatic sexual incidents involving the older comedian and his friends. But this was the only time he spoke of a criminal offence.

Detectives found some Facebook messages between the pair and decided they were friendly, but could not crack the security features on Ben’s phone.The Met said: ‘Following an assessment of the available material no criminal offences were disclosed.’

The celebrity accused of grooming Ben Cowburn has denied knowing the teenager.

The gay comedian dedicated a gig to the 18-year-old after his death in 2010. But when asked by

The Mail on Sunday about his former friend this week, the TV star replied: ‘Who’s Ben Cowburn?’When he was reminded that he had previously paid tribute to Ben, the comic said: ‘I don’t remember.’The star – referred to only as ‘Mr X’ at Ben’s inquest – then refused to answer any further questions.

When told that Ben’s twin sister Sophia had spoken of concerns that her brother had been ‘groomed’ by the comedian in London, he replied: ‘I have nothing to say.’

The comedian was approached again by this newspaper after the conclusion of the inquest in Truro, Cornwall. He refused to answer any questions, and walked away.

The comic has, however, made a series of angry comments on the internet about the allegations surrounding him.

These cannot be reported for legal reasons, after coroner Dr Emma Carlyon unusually granted him anonymity at Ben’s inquest.

At a pre-inquest hearing attended by lawyers for Ben’s family and the hospital where he died, the coroner decided that the older man should only be referred to as ‘X’. Sources say it was because he was not a witness and had not been interviewed by the police.

The media were not told about this hearing in advance and the coroner did not make a formal order banning the reporting of the name. Media law expert David Banks said of the decision: ‘I’ve never seen anything like it myself. I can’t see that it was entirely successful or satisfactory for any party. It’s very unusual.’ 

The name of the gay comedian was not mentioned during the inquest at Epiphany House in Truro, Cornwall, last week

Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘This case worries me. Secrecy does not seem to be justified, but is enforced by the judicial system.’

Under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, judges and coroners can keep the identities of individuals secret, but only if they would refuse to give evidence otherwise, or if naming them would not be in the interests of justice.

Even police officers involved in highly sensitive shootings have been named in inquests after challenges to anonymity orders.

After last week’s Mail on Sunday revealed details of the comedian’s relationship with Ben, he hired a prominent legal firm to ensure his name remained secret.

The internet remains awash  with speculation over his identity, but his solicitors have threatened to sue any newspaper which unmasks him.
