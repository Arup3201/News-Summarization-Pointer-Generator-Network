 They were an aspirational family who believed in hard work, the importance of education and good manners.

In their middle-class suburban neighbourhood Jitendra Lad, 49, his wife Daksha, 44, and their two teenage daughters were regarded as ‘the nicest family in the world’.

But yesterday police were investigating the mysterious deaths of all four members of this seemingly loving family.

Detectives believe that Mr Lad may have murdered his wife and daughters Trisha, 19, and Nisha, 16, before killing himself.

The family had not been seen for several days when a neighbour gained access to their £250,000 detached house and found the horrific scene on Monday evening.

Police and ambulance were called to the quiet cul-de-sac at 8.30pm. Mrs Lad and her daughters were dead in one room and Mr Lad was found hanging in another. Friends and neighbours were unaware of any problems in the family and had heard no arguments.

Both parents had good jobs as clerical officers with the local council and were keen to climb the career ladder.

Trisha was in her second year at Leeds University studying for a degree in biochemistry and Nisha was at sixth form.

Forensic officers yesterday scoured the house in Clayton, Bradford, as detectives began researching the family for a motive to the horrific murder.

Post-mortems were due to be carried out today to discover how Mrs Lad and her daughters died, but their deaths were being treated as ‘murder’.

Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

The parents and Nisha were seen heading to work and school as normal at around 7.30am on Friday, saying their usual cheerful hello to the newspaper delivery man. However, police said the bodies ‘may have been in the property for some time’ and neighbours could not recall seeing the family over the weekend.

Mr Lad and his wife married in Bradford 23 years ago. The Hindu couple worked at Bradford Council, Mr Lad in revenue and benefits while his wife was an administrator.

Shop manager Niraj Patel, 49, a friend of Mr Lad, said he was stunned to be told he may have murdered his family. ‘He was a very happy, easy-going chap, always a smile on his face,’ he said. ‘I’m totally shocked. You’d never believe he would have an ounce of violence in him.’

Susan Hawkins, 34, a support worker, said: ‘They were the nicest family in the world and the last family you would ever expect this to happen to. I used to see the mum in the playground when the kids were younger and she had a gorgeous smile, she was a real doting mum.’

Mr Lad’s parents were being supported by family at their home less than half a mile from the scene yesterday.

A relative, who did not want to be named, said: ‘They are very, very shocked. They don’t know what exactly has happened, they are waiting for the police to tell them.’

Neighbours at the family’s previous address in Clayton, where they lived for 14 years, said the couple sold up to move to a better area and a better home.

One said: ‘You could call them aspirational. She wanted to be head of planning or something like that.’

Jessica Garside, 18, who used to catch the bus to school with the girls, said: ‘Trisha was really clever and always had a nice word to say about people.’ 

Couple: A friend said that Mr and Mrs Lad were inseparable and even worked at the same council as clerical staff

Much loved: Friends said today Nisha and Trisha, left and right, they were bereft after their deaths

Crime scene: Sources say that the deaths are linked to the father of the house, who then killed himself

Upset: Neighbours said today there were no clues that a tragedy like this would engulf a 'lovely' family

Chris Sampson, the headmaster at Thornton Grammar School, where Nisha Lad and her sister Trisha both studied, said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by these tragic deaths. Our thoughts are withthe family's relatives and friends. We will be helping the police with their enquiry in any way we can.' 

The University of Leeds confirmed Trisha was in the second year of a biochemistry degree.

A spokesman said: 'This is dreadful and shocking news and our thoughts are with Trisha's friends and loved ones.

'Staff are working with the University's counselling and chaplaincy services to help students who are affected by this tragedy and we will do all we can to support them.'

Melissa Taylor, president of the Faculty of Biological Sciences Society at the university, said on Twitter: 'Heartbreaking to hear about the death of Trisha Lad, such a lovely, well-liked person. Rest in Peace.'

Steph Mapplebeck said: 'Trisha Lad was one of the sweetest and kindest people I have met whilst studying at Leeds. What a heartbreaking loss. Rest in peace.'
