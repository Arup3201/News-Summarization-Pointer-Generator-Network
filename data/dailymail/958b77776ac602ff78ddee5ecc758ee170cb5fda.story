Murdered: Eileen Jones was kicked and stamped to death as she went o take a meal to her blind neighbour

A man who kicked and stamped a great-grandmother to death as she delivered a meal to her blind neighbour has been jailed for life.

Pensioner Eileen Jones, 73, was not found until the next morning after the brutal attack by Christopher Newton, 45, in Bethnal Green, east London.

Her body was discovered by paramedics in the blood-spattered ground floor flat of blind resident Paul Rangel after he hit an emergency alarm.

Mrs Jones, who used a trolley to help her walk, had suffered multiple fractures to her face and body. Newton had left his bloodied footprint on her clothing.

He was found guilty of murder after a jury ignored his claims that Mr Rangel, 60, had worn all of his clothes to carry out the killing.

Members of Mrs Jones family cheered and clapped in the public gallery as the verdict was announced.

Jailing Newton for life with a minimum term of 22 years, Judge Paul Worsley QC said: 'You showed not a flicker of remorse.

'You left the flat taking with you any evidence you thought might implicate you in the killing.

'You had stayed in the flat with the body for a time but you sought no help.

'It is likely she survived 30 minutes after the infliction of the injuries. One can only hope she was unconscious.'

Mrs Jones had met Newton by chance as he was in the flat with Mr Rangel when she called on him.

She had last been seen after winning Â£6 at bingo on March 23, when she offered to deliver the uneaten meal to her neighbour Mr Rangel.

She agreed to stay with them for a drink, but unbeknown to her alcoholic Newton had been drinking all day.

He went out later to buy a bottle of brandy and was known to become 'increasingly aggressive' when under the influence of alcohol.

The judge said: 'For reasons known only to you, you carried out an attack on that vulnerable lady who posed no threat to you what so ever.

'The pathologist described the attack as ferocious, so it was. You punched her, kicked her and stamped on her. You broke bones in her face and body and I am satisfied by that attack you intended to kill her.'

Mrs Jones who was pronounced dead upon the arrival of paramedics at the property in Bethnal Green on March 23 this year.

The pensioner's blood was later found soaked into Newton's trainers, jeans and shirt, while shoe imprints matching his footwear were also found on her face and clothing.

His palm print was also found on a wall close to her body, while further bloodstains were found in the flat's kitchen and bathrooms.

Mrs Jones was widowed in 2006 after almost 50 years of marriage.

A mother-of-four, grandmother-of-three and great-grandmother to four, she moved from Bethnal Green, where she had lived for much of her life, after her husband's death to be closer to her family in Chelmsford.

But she returned to the East End after failing to settle in Essex.

In a statement her family said they wanted to remember her as 'independent, happy and full of life not how she would have looked after such a merciless assault'.

One of her daughter's Jackie Robinson said: 'The vision of what happened to her haunts my every waking moment.'

Judge Worsley described Mrs Jones as a 'cheerful friendly and caring lady'.

He told Newton: 'She was 73. she was vulnerable, you took advantage of her mercilessly.'
