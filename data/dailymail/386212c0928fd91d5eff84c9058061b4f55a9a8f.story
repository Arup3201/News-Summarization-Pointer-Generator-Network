Pictures have emerged of New York Knicks' star Jason Kidd partying hard at a Long Island club, just hours before he was arrested for drunken driving after crashing his Cadillac SUV.

The two-time Olympic gold medalist told police he didn't remember the wreck early Sunday and didn't feel any pain, even though he received minor injuries and had to be hospitalized when he smashed into a telephone pole and skidding 25 feet into the woods.

The new photos reportedly show Kidd, his shirt stained with sweat, dancing at a trendy nightclub prior to his arrest.

The bust comes just three days after he signed a contract to become the Knick's newest guard -- the biggest star to sign on for the team in the off season.

The pictures, posted by Barstool Sports, were sent in by a reader who said, 'My buddy’s wife was at last night (sic) where Kidd was partying. Said he had to be carried out by security at the end of the night because he was so wasted.'

Before his wild clubbing, Kidd, 39, attended an upscale gala in the Hamptons thrown by rapper Ne-Yo's Compound Foundation, which provides money to 'empower and inspire youth in foster care.'

The event was in honor of Star Wars creator George Lucas. Kidd tweeted a photo of himself and his wife Porschla Coleman looking respectable with the legendary filmmaker.

From there, he went on to the SL East club, where he began drinking vodka and dancing. At some point during the night his wife went home and left him alone in the club, the New York Daily News reports.

He left after breaking a light fixture when he tried to swing from it. Witnesses say he had to be supported by friends to make it to his SUV.

Police allege the NBA guard blew through a stop sign in the upscale village of Water Mill on Long Island on his way home and crashed into a telephone pole, snapping it off at the base.

The SUV also skidded about 25 feet off the road into the woods and struck several trees.

The crash occurred just a mile and a half from the $6 million summer home he owns in the Hamptons.

Police say he claimed he didn't remember the crash. An officer noted he had watery, bloodshot eyes and was unsteady on his feet.

An officer reported smelling alcohol on his breath, though Kidd refused to breathalyzer test.

Witnesses told the Daily News that Kidd stumbled out of his SUV and slumped to the ground as he waited for police to arrive.

'I saw him lying down, completely out of it. I think he was just so wasted.' Gautam Ahuja told the newspaper.

After the crash, Kidd was taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries.

He was then arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated.

His lawyer said he will plead not guilty.

Despite the reported antics and the crash, Kidd's mother-in-law is sticking up for him.

'He was tired. He’s not a drunk!' Denotra Coleman, his wife's mother, told the Daily News.

She said that Kidd has been a good father an a good husband to Porschla -- his second wife.

She said Kidd just fathered his fifth child with Porschla and that he never would have driven home drunk with a small child at home.

The latest Knicks recruit signed a three-year, $9.5 million deal with the basketball team on Thursday.

Prior to that he had played for the Dallas Mavericks since 2008, and also led the New Jersey Nets to two NBA Finals appearances.

He also has Olympic two gold medals -- playing for Team USA in 2000 and 2008 -- and won the NBA finals with Dallas in 2011.

In
2001 he pleaded guilty to a domestic violence charge involving his 
ex-wife, Joumana. He is now married to former model Porschla Coleman.
