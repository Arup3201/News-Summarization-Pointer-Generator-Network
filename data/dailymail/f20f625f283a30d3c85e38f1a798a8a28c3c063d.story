Juventus have been enjoying the sights and sounds of Sydney as they prepare to take on the A-League All Stars on Sunday in their latest tour match.

Coach Massimiliano Allegri and his players posed for pictures in front of the iconic Harbour Bridge and Opera House as the Italian champions count down to the match at ANZ Stadium.

Among those greeting the club's Australian fan base in Sydney was veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, striker Carlos Tevez and new signing Patrice Evra, who joined from Manchester United earlier in the summer.

New challenge: Patrice Evra, in Australia with Juventus ahead of a match against A-League All Stars, is keen to add to his mammoth trophy haul with Manchester United and maintain the Old Lady's domestic dominance

The 33-year-old left-back had won five Premier League titles and the Champions League at Old Trafford but decided to leave after eight years in a £1.2m deal.

And the Frenchman could be forgiven for feeling a sense of deja-vu as he touched down in Sydney, for he was there with United 12 months ago at the very start of the ill-fated David Moyes reign.

His expectations of lifting every piece of silverware remain as high as ever, though.

'Now I am a Juventus player, it's a massive club with a big history,' he told a news conference on Friday.

'We are a strong side, we have some great champions in the team.

'It doesn't change from when you are with Manchester United, when you arrive you have the same number of fans. It shows you how big a club this is, how many trophies they have won.

'And that's why I chose to come and play for this club, because I know all that matters is winning, this is the winning mentality and I love that.'

Juventus won the Scudetto by a 17-point margin last season, their third successive title win, but saw coach Antonio Conte depart over the summer.

Allegri, who was last at Milan, will be tasked with regaining the title and also improving the club's wretched recent record in Europe.

It is a challenge that Evra readily accepts.

Moving on: Patrice Evra admits it was hard to leave Old Trafford after eight successful years there but is ready for a fresh challenge in Italy

'It was very difficult to leave Man United because it was like my second family,' he said.

'But as soon as I knew there was interest from Juve, I knew it would be a new challenge for me because I have to repay the faith they showed in me.

'I have to show more as a Juventus player because we have to win four times in a row. It's never easy to win four times in a row.

'I won it with Man United three times but four times is really difficult. And we have to do much better in the Champions League.'

Evra made his Juventus debut in Jakarta on Wednesday as an Indonesia XI were thrashed 8-1 but they are expecting a much stiffer test against an A-League side led by club legend Alessandro del Piero.

The striker won Serie A eight times at Juventus, as well as the Champions League, the Italian Cup and the Intercontinental Cup in a glittering career.

Del Piero refused to have a bad word about Juventus despite being about to play against them for the only time in his life.

He said: 'No, no, no. I had a great time at Juventus and I enjoyed every single moment. I am still a fan of Juventus now.

'I spent 19 years at Juventus. For sure, it was not just one part of my life, it is a great and big part of my life.

'The connection between the fans, the club and the team is still strong and I'm happy.'
