A man accused of making child pornography with a boy he and his Australian partner purchased in Russia for a reported $8000 was sentenced Friday in U.S. federal court in Indiana.According to investigators, dual Australian-American citizen Mark J Newton, 42, and his partner Peter Truong, 36, used a falsified birth certificate listing Newton as the child's biological father to adopt the boy and take him to their home in Cairns in Queensland, Australia.

Newton was sentenced to 40 years in an Indiana court, where the videos were found downloaded on a home computer after pleading guilty to conspiracy charges involving possessing child pornography and sexual exploitation of a minor.

The judge overseeing the case said she accepted the plea agreement only because the videos were too horrific to show a jury.

Australia's ABC News reports that the boy, now eight, had been living with the men in Cairns for several years when in 2011 New Zealand authorities discovered evidence on a New Zealand man's computer that the boy had been used in child pornography.Australian police raided the couple's house in 2011, just after the men and the boy had left for the United States. Police discovered a 'mountain of material' and seized computers, electronic equipment and documents that uncovered high-definition video and images of child exploitation.

During the hearing, prosecutors said the charges stemmed from abuse that occurred when the boy was four to six years old. But prosecutors said they discovered video this week showing Newton using the boy for a sex act when he was less than two years old.

Investigators also allege the man and his partner took the boy to foreign countries where they allowed other men to abuse him, often recording the acts.

The videos were uploaded to an international syndicate known as the Boy Lovers Network.The Boy Lovers Network is known to police as a forum for men who describe sexual abuse of boys between the ages of two and 10 as a form of consensual love between man and boy.

According to 7:30, Boylover.net had 70,000 members worldwide before it was the subject of a series of global raids that resulted in the arrests of 670 men around the world.'These men submitted this young child to some of the most heinous acts of exploitation that this office has ever seen,' Indiana U.S. Attorney Joe Hogsett said in a statement late Friday, following the hearing.Newton and Truong had been living with the boy in California when they were arrested in 2012. Prosecutors said the boy had been rescued and was being cared for in California.U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker said the man sentenced Friday deserved a harsher punishment, but she didn't want to subject jurors to such disturbing evidence.'This is not a case that lends itself to easy understanding,' Barker said during the hearing.In a quaking voice, the shackled Newton stood before Barker and apologized, saying 'being a father was an honor and a privilege that amounted to the best six years of my life.''I'm deeply sorry,' he added. 'And I regret any harm I caused to my son or anyone else.''Words don't help,' Barker responded. 'What can be said? What can be done to erase some of the horror of this?'The judge noted that Newton and Truong went to great lengths to 'acquire' an infant from a mother in Russia and brainwashed him into thinking the abuse he endured was normal.

Federal prosecutor Steve DeBrota said the crimes occurred in Australia, the U.S., France and Germany. U.S. authorities also found videos involving two more boys at Truong and Newton's Cairns home.DeBrota said evidence showed at least eight men had sexually abused the boy, including one in Illinois and one in Florida, though other details weren't released.Newton was also ordered to pay $400,000 in restitution to the boy.Monica Foster, chief public defender for the Southern Indiana U.S. District, declined comment following the hearing.

The document also said the men used falsified documents to bring the boy to the U.S. and to legalize the adoption in Los Angeles.Pornographic recordings of the abuse were found on computers in San Francisco; Arlington, Virginia; and Anderson, Indiana, according to investigators. U.S. postal inspectors worked with federal prosecutors to trace the pornography to its source.

Truong is awaiting his sentence, while two other American men have also been charged.Queensland police officer Jon Rouse, who investigates online child exploitation as part of Taskforce Argos, says authorities in Australia won't rest until all the men involved in the network have been caught.

'With this network, rest assured that we will pursue them to the ends of the Earth to make sure each and every one of them faces justice for what their role has been in crimes against this child,' he told 7.30.

'The purchase of the child for the explicit and sole purpose of exploiting him across a network of men is incredibly depraved and a very sad tale for that little boy.'

Truong and Newton evaded detection for six years, appearing for all intents and purposes as doting parents of a little boy, until the chance discovery in New Zealand exposed their true motivations.

President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill that sharply limits the adoption of Russian children by people from countries that allow same-sex marriage.

The new law prohibits adoption by same-sex foreign couples whose homeland recognizes their union as marriage, as well as by single people or unmarried couples from those countries.

A Kremlin statement said the measure is intended to guarantee children a 'harmonious' upbringing and protect them from 'complexes, emotional suffering and stress.'

The bill signed Wednesday is the latest move by Russia to buck the Western trend toward greater acceptance of homosexuality. On Sunday, Putin approved a ban on giving children any information about gays.

The adoption bill further shrinks the possibilities for 600,000 Russian children without parental custody. Last year, Russia banned all adoptions by Americans.
