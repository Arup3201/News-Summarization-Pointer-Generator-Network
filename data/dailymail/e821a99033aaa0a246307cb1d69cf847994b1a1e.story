David Davis said chief police officers can no longer be trusted to carry out major disciplinary investigations into officers

Chief police officers can no longer be trusted to carry out major disciplinary investigations into their own officers, former Tory Party Chairman David Davis said last night.

Mr Davis, an ally of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, said revelations around the Plebgate scandal showed chief constables had failed to properly investigate their own juniors - and misconduct should be ‘taken out of their hands’.

His comments came as the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would re-open its probe into a now infamous meeting between Mr Mitchell and three Police Federation representatives in October last year.

The three officers met Mr Mitchell amid furore over claims he had called police officers ‘f****** plebs’ after they refused to let him cycle his bike through the Downing Street gates. The fallout from the incident resulted in his resignation a month later.

Following the meeting, the three officers, Sergeant Chris Jones, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Inspector Ken Mackaill told the media Mr Mitchell had ‘refused to elaborate’ on what happened during the altercation.

A secret recording of the meeting, made by Mr Mitchell, showed he had provided a detailed account of what happened, but a misconduct probe cleared the three officers of lying.

Yesterday a report by MPs said the evidence the three officers had provided to them at a public hearing last month was ‘misleading, possibly deliberately so, and lacking in credibility’.

Their accounts were ‘contradictory, inconsistent and provided little or no insight into their actions’, the Home Affairs Select Committee concluded.

The committee has told two of the officers, Sgt Jones and Det Sgt Hinton that they must appear before it again tomorrow and apologise or be in contempt of Parliament.

At the same time, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would reopen its investigation into the meeting with Mr Mitchell, after it found ‘procedural irregularities’ in how the police handled it.

Mr Davis said it was ‘astonishing’ and ‘deplorable’ that three chief constables had been prepared to ignore clear evidence more junior officers had not told the truth about a meeting with Mr Mitchell at the height of the scandal.

When they appeared before the committee, the Chief Constable Andy Parker of Warwickshire, West Mercia chief David Shaw and Chris Sims from the West Midlands force all apologised to Mr Mitchell. But only Mr Shaw said he thought the disciplinary probe should be reopened.

MPs on the committee said the officers had shown ‘an absence of leadership’ over the affair.

Mr Davis told the Mail: ‘Truth is central to the judicial system so you expect the police to abide by that.’

The recording of the meeting proved that the three officers ‘weren’t telling the truth,‘ he said, and given that, it was ‘really worrying’ that disciplinary action had not been taken.

He added: ‘For the chief constables of three important police forces to let it go is astonishing. I’m afraid it shows you cannot trust the Chief Constables at all to do this.

‘All complaints above a relatively trivial level should go to the IPCC and they should be equipped to carry them out, including the disciplinary hearings.

‘What we need is a core of untouchables to investigate anyone without fear or favour. That way the bad apples in the police will not be able to bring the others in to disrepute.

‘This will be welcomed by the vast majority of officers who are probably very unhappy about this.’

The scathing report by the committee accused the three Federation officers of ‘obstructing the truth’ when they appeared before its MPs last month.

It said: ‘If evidence was given in a similar manner by three serving police officers to a court of law it is our view that such testimony would undermine a case and lead a jury to reach an unfavourable conclusion as to the credibility of the evidence given by those police officers.’ 

It criticised Det Sgt Hinton for referring to Home Secretary Theresa May as ‘that woman’ at the meeting, before claiming he was misquoted.

IPCC deputy chairman Deborah Glass said there were ‘procedural irregularities’ between the production of a draft version of the disciplinary report and a final version that warranted further investigation.

Miss Glass said the IPCC would conduct the investigation itself so public confidence was not eroded further.

Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The narrative of what we have seen could rival any great work of fiction.

‘At every point and at every level, instead of being transparent, we have uncovered a process that obstructs the truth. If this can happen to a Cabinet minister, what hope is there for anyone else?’
