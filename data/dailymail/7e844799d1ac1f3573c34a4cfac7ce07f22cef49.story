A little over two years ago, Lee Selby could barely fill a Welsh leisure centre but the featherweight from Barry now stands on the verge of winning a world title.

A stoppage victory over Australian Joel Brunker at London's O2 Arena earned the 27-year-old the right to challenge IBF belt holder Evgeny Gradovich.

Selby, nicknamed the ‘Welsh Mayweather’ due to his slick, evasive style, and formerly the British, European and Commonwealth champion, dominated from he first bell until 11 seconds before the end of the ninth round when a left hook to the body left Brunker on the canvas.

Selby's stock has risen since joining Eddie Hearn at Matchroom last year.

Indeed, on Selby's unveiling, his promoter offered to stake his house on his new charge winning a world title.

That bet looks more and more like a safe investment as Selby ground his opponent down until the clinical and decisive finish.

Brunker, who was unbeaten in 27 fights, had broken up his 10,000 mile journey from New South Wales with a stopover in New York.

But he looked a long way from home as Selby established his distance, measured his shots and found his target.

Brunker was content to play the role of the aggressor but left himself open to the Welshman's fast hands. A right hand on the bell for the end of the second was an exclamation mark on another successful session and, save for the odd flash of defiance, Brunker continued to ship punishment in the third round with Selby's right uppercut hitting its target as if laser-guided.

After a quieter fourth stanza, Brunker again looked short of ideas as Selby let his hands go before slipping off and out of reach, like a shadow in the night.

Between them, 25 of their combined 47 fights had gone the distance and by the halfway stage here, that trend looked set to continue.

The penny appeared to drop for Brunker at the start of the seventh round, however, as the Australian doubled his work rate in a bid to reduce his deficit.

But normal service was resumed in what would prove to be the final session.

After twice having Brunker at his mercy against the ropes, Selby finished the job at the third attempt, leaving his opponent winded on the canvas with no chance of recovery.

Gradovich, the champion for 18 months, will defend his title against Jayson Velez in Nebraska next month.

Selby will be watching with interest.
