This Christmas was always going to be difficult for the family for Lily-Mae McKinstry, a 10-year-old from Essex who tragically died of brain cancer last month.

But the shadow hanging over the family's festive season has been partially lifted after mystery Christmas presents starting arriving in the post.

The schoolgirl's parents have now discovered that their daughter spent her final days buying her relatives gifts online.

Lily, from Chelmsford, lost her battle with a rare and terminal brain tumour earlier this winter, leaving her parents Andrew and Vicki heartbroken.

But they have been left amazed at their daughter's ingenuity after they started receiving the gifts she bought with her father's credit card in the post.

The family of Lily-Mae McKinstry (right) were left devastated by her death from a brain tumour last month. They have now discovered the youngster ordered them all presents online in the weeks before she died

Lily was diagnosed with a rare and terminal brain tumour earlier this year and underwent radiotherapy

Mrs McKinstry, 42, a hairdresser, said: 'When Lily passed away last month both me, Andrew and her big brother Ethan, were all left completely devastated.

'Our whole world came crashing down, we were making plans and expected Lily to be around for Christmas.

'After she died we were sorting out her things and were so shocked when we saw Andrew's credit card details in her notebook - but when we chased it up the penny dropped. Our beautiful, special girl had brought us all surprise Christmas presents.

'Now every few days we are receiving packages in the post, it's really emotional when we open them but it's also so comforting. Lily was so thoughtful and organised, I know how happy this would've made her.'

Mr McKinstry, 48, a brewery  engineer, said: 'So far we have received bandanas in all of our favourite colours - Ethan loves wearing them, so she knew he'd appreciate the gift.

'She's also sent a chicken costume for Ethan which was a funny surprise and completely shows her sense of humour, and also some books.

'A really special gift was a Build-A-Bear teddy bear which we were going to bury with Lily, but after her big brother saw it he wanted to keep it to remind him of her.'

The youngster made a 'bucket list' after being diagnosed with the tumour and the list included a wish meeting famous people. It came true when she met One Direction earlier this year

Mr McKinstry added: 'We could never be mad at Lily for paying for our presents on my credit card, she was so clever and it's amazing seeing what gifts she wanted to get us.

'We even found thank you cards addressed to everyone she cared for.

'We don't know what gifts we'll receive or when, but every single one is a really special present from Lily.'

The surprise gifts are helping the family cope during their first Christmas without their daughter.

DIPG is a type of brain tumour found in the lower back of the brain, near the top of the spinal cord.

The tumours tend to be discovered during childhood, with most of those diagnosed being found in youngsters between the ages of five and seven.

The condition makes up around 10 per cent of all brain tumours found in children.

Unfortunately, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for DIPG in recent years and only 10% of children found to have the tumours live for more than two years after diagnosis.

There is no known cure for the tumours, which are often treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery.

Mrs McKinstry said: 'It's helping us get through Christmas without her, it makes it feel like she's still with us in some way.

'Lily just loved this time of year - she still believed in Santa Claus, and we couldn't wait to spend this Christmas with her as we though it would be her last one.

'The presents are made even more special because we know how excited Lily would have been to give them to us.

'We get so excited whenever we see the postman, as we just can't wait to see what he'll deliver next.'

Lily led an active  life before her diagnosis, but she started suffering from weak muscles in her arms, legs, eyes and face and, in May this year, she was diagnosed with Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) - an extremely rare and terminal brain tumour.

Mrs McKinstry said: 'Our lives were turned upside down, Lily was quite the adrenaline junkie and loved indoor skydiving and wake boarding. She was perfectly healthy before her diagnosis and had a real lust for life.

'Her tumour in the brain stem was inoperable, so Lily had to undergo six weeks of radiotherapy at UCL Hospital.

'Lily never moaned, she was so brave and she returned home to us in mid-July. It was great seeing her be able to chew, talk and walk normally again.

'But tragically a week after her eight week check-up scan, she started having the same symptoms again and a CT scan confirmed the tumour was growing.'

Mrs McKinstry added: 'We were told this time that there was nothing more doctors could do, Lily fought so hard but in the end she couldn't stop it from claiming her life. She achieved so much though in such a short time and we are all so proud of her.

'We found a note in her bedroom after she had passed away which we know she had written after her radiotherapy because of her handwriting.

'The note said that if she was to pass away young she wanted her IPad to go to her dad, her laptop to go to her brother, her favourite mannequin to me, her clothes to go to poor children and any money to go towards her funeral.

'That was just the kind of girl she was, so kind and caring.'

Mr and Mrs McKinstry are now in the process of completing a bucket list Lily drew up to honour their late daughter.

Mrs McKinstry said: 'It's really important that we carry out Lily's wishes after everything she's been through.

'Some of her wishes were really mature for her age - number one was to have world peace and number two to have better access for disabled people in the underground system.

'She received a letter back from Boris Johnson about it which was amazing and he did a video message to her.'

Her parents say the secret scheme by their daughter has made a difficult Christmas easier to get through

Lily was carried by horse-drawn hearse to her funeral as one of her 'bucket list' wishes was to enjoy a horse and carriage ride

She added: 'Lily was a huge fan of the X Factor as well and was supposed to meet Simon Cowell the day she died.

'She met One Direction and had video messages from stars including Pixie Lott, Ollie Murs and Louis Walsh. One of her favourite things was taking a helicopter ride, she loved it.

'Every message made Lily smile and they meant so much, I want to thank everyone who took part in making my girl's last days so special.

'I know we might not be able to complete everything on the bucket list but we are going to try.

'Last week we all stayed in a posh hotel with two bath tubs in the room.'

Mr McKinstry said: 'We know some of her things on her bucket list will be hard but we will keep going - we would do anything for her.

'We want to raise as much awareness about DIPG as possible, we need more research so more lives can be saved and finally a cure can be found.'
