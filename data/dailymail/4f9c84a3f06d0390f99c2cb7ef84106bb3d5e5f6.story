A former factory worker who spent thousands of his savings restoring a cemetery has been banned from tending the graves of war heroes by church officials.

Stephen Jackson, 62, forked out for new gates at the entrance of his local graveyard and has spent four years renovating crumbling tombs and cutting brambles.

But the dedicated volunteer, who has won awards for his selfless work, has now been ordered to down tools after a meeting with religious chiefs from his diocese.

Banned: Stephen Jackson, 62, spent thousands of his savings restoring St Mary Redcliffe Cemetery in Bristol, but has been told he can no longer tend the graves of war heroes by church officials

They claim he is not permitted to carry out work on graves and say he needs to apply for a permit to continue his vital refurbishments.

Stunned Mr Jackson said today: 'I was so upset when I came out of the meeting.

'They told me I shouldn’t have had the gates done. What I have done, I’ve done with my own resources - but they are not going to stop me.

'For the diocese to have allowed for the cemetery to get into that position is a disgrace.

'If it was just left it would become more and more overgrown.'

Mr Jackson started visiting St Mary Redcliffe Cemetery in Bristol four years ago to visit the resting place of Colston Marshall, dad of his foster father George Marshall.

As a child Mr Jackson and his brother were rescued from a life in a children’s home by Mr Marshall and his wife Gladys.

Savings: Mr Jackson paid thousands of pounds out of his own pocket to have the old gates professionally restored and claims he has spent £9,000 renovating the cemetery

The former Cadbury’s chocolate factory worker thought tending to the graves was a fitting way of showing his gratitude.

He has renovated five graves of Victoria Cross winners, as well as the final resting place of Bristol firefighter Arthur Wale - who died in 1906 while battling a factory blaze.

Mr Jackson, who lives with his brother in Longwell Green, Bristol, also began clearing other parts of the cemetery - cutting back overgrown plants and shifting rubble.

He even paid thousands of pounds out of his own pocket to have the old gates professionally restored and claims he has spent £9,000 renovating the cemetery.

The tireless Good Samaritan even won a First Gold Star award from his local newspaper, the Bristol Evening Post, last year for dedicating his time and money to the graveyard.

He says he has always kept the church office at St Mary Redcliffe informed about any works he has carried out and they have never asked him to stop.

But now the Diocese of Bristol - which is in charge of Anglican churches in the area - has said he should not do any more work in the grounds, which are a mile-and-a-half away from St Mark Redcliffe Church itself on the city’s Bath Road.

At a meeting with diocesan officials Mr Jackson was told he should only tend to the graves that belong to his own relatives.

They also said he should not have arranged for the cemetery gates to be restored - even though he paid the bill himself.

Mr Jackson said: 'I had a meeting with the diocese and they have asked me not to do any more work in the cemetery because they think it is not my concern.

'It is the first time anyone has said anything like this.

'I had told them I was trying to get the chapel restored and they told me I was not to do anything because it is consecrated ground.

'Everything I have done at the cemetery I have always informed the church office about and they know what I have been doing because I have always informed them and the council.

'When the wrought iron gates were taken away I informed the church as a matter of courtesy but the diocese have told me that they didn’t like the thought of me doing the gates.'

Bristol Diocese said because St Mary Redcliffe Cemetery is now closed to burials, responsibility for its maintenance lies with the city council.

It claimed that work to graves, churches and cemeteries requires a request for permission - called a faculty.

In a statement the diocese said: 'Mr Jackson has been advised that, although he is welcome to look after the graves and memorials of his relatives, as a matter of ecclesiastical law, no works should be carried out on other graves and memorials or parts of the cemetery and chapel without a ‘faculty’ from the Diocesan Chancellor.

'The faculty jurisdiction is designed to safeguard consecrated church property, in particular graves and monuments. Mr Jackson has not applied for a faculty at this time.'
