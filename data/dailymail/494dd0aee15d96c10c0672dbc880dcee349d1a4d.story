The minds behind The Simpsons have spent two years creating it's most expensive episode ever and it's first that places America's favorite family in a Springfield made of LEGOs.

The episode dubbed Brick Like Me will be historic episode number 550 of what is now the longest running scripted series in television history.

But it wasn't easy getting there.

Is that you, Marge? A May 4 episode of The Simpsons puts America's favorite family into a LEGO-fied Springfield

Very special: The episode is historic on many fronts. Not only will it be the 550th episode, but it will also rank as the most expensive half-hour Simpsons episode ever produced

'We've literally been at this thing for two years â€” twice the time it takes to do one of our regular episodes,' executive producer Matt Selman told TV Guide.

The idea for the episode began with LEGO Group approaching Fox about creating a Simpson's character playset.

LEGO's president of licensing Jill Wilfert told TV Guide that while merchandising was still being hashed out, the 80-year-old company suggested the show do a LEGO opening couch sequence.

'They quickly came back to us and said, 'Forget the couch; let's do an entire episode!'" Wilfert said.

It was the start of a delicate dance between two popular culture titans.

'We're pretty picky about how our brand is represented,' Wilfert said. 'No one at the show is used to dealing with creative input from the outside.'

TV Guide's sneak peek of the May 4 episode revealed it to be a tamer offering than viewers are accustomed to from the series, but it did show LEGO showing more leg than usual.

TV Guide writes:

'LEGO Homer and LEGO Marge get frisky and are clearly heading to the bedroom. Their afterglow scene, with LEGO arms, hands and feet pulled apart and scattered everywhere, is priceless.'

The central character of the episode is Homer, who is excited when he first finds himself in LEGO world but later finds himself wonders if it's where he and his now-plastic family belong.

What Homer decides had yet to be revealed, but the work put into the episode and the beloved status of both brands ensures the show will me a memorable one.

'At its core, the LEGO brand is all about creativity and imagination,' said Wilfert of the pairing. 'We respect that in others.'

The historic episode was the result of a delicate dance between titans: the 82-year-old LEGOs brand and the longest-running scripted series in the history of television

Playset: The show is also timed with the release of special edition collectible Simpsons LEGO men (and women and baby)
