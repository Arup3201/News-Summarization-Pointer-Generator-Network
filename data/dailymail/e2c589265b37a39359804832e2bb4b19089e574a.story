Everton manager Roberto Martinez hailed Romelu Lukaku as being 'back to his best' after the striker convincingly won his heavyweight contest with Manchester City's £32million defender Eliaquim Mangala on points.

Lukaku, criticised this season for some lacklustre performances, was too quick and strong for his rival on a number of occasions and was the catalyst for a stirring Everton comeback against the champions.

The Belgian – signed for £28million from Chelsea in the summer after a successful loan spell at Goodison Park - twice outpaced Mangala to nearly score, forced the City defender into a yellow card with another strong run and by the end the centre-half was panicky enough to nearly concede a penalty against Phil Jagielka, and then let Steven Naismith free for the equaliser that saw Everton salvage a 1-1 draw.

Lukaku, 21, said after his FA cup goal against West Ham in midweek that he had asked Martinez to play more direct football to help his game.

And the Everton boss was happy enough with his centre-forward on Saturday.

'Romelu is a player who needs to be at his physical best because of the power and pace in his game,' said Martinez.

'He can't contribute by just being half-fit and after the World Cup he wanted to make himself available even when he wasn't fully 100 per cent.

The Brazilian midfielder was unmarked in the six-yard box to flick a header into the bottom corner 

'Now he feels strong and can work for the 90 minutes. He proved in the races with Mangala and Martin Demichelis that he is strong. He would score in that position against Joe Hart nine times out of 10 but on this one the goalkeeper made a very good save. Romelu was full of character and responsibility. He looked back to his very best.'

Mangala is finding his first season in English football but boss Manuel Pellegrini went through the same thing with Demichelis last season. 

'We will analyse all the performances with the players but I hope people remember Demichelis had criticism last season and he became a very important player for us,' said the City manager.
