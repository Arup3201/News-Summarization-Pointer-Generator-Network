The parents of an 11-year-old autistic boy have been arrested after the child was found living in a cage in the family's California home.

Anaheim child protective services and police were dispatched Tuesday night to the home in the 1300 block of Garrett Street after receiving a tip that a boy was being kept in a large dog kennel, police Lt. Bob Dunn said. When officers went inside, they found the cage with a mattress and bedding in it.

The boy's severe autism means he cannot communicate and often has violent outbursts, which have grown more violent over the years, Dunn said. 

It is 
believed the parents, Loi Vu, 40, and Tracy Le, 35, kept him in the cage
 to protect themselves and their two younger children.

Arrested: The parents, Loi Vu, 40, left, and Tracy Le, 35, right, of an 11-year-old autistic boy have been arrested after the child was found living in a cage in the family's California home

Cage: Crime scene investigator and a detective carry a cage from a residence in Anaheim. An 11-year-old autistic boy who police suspect was kept in a cage has been removed from the home, and his parents have been arrested

The
 cage was big enough that the boy was not forced into an 'unnatural 
position,' Dunn said, adding that there were no other signs of potential
 abuse.

The boy was well nourished and had no visible injuries, he said. Regardless, the child was taken to a local hospital for a check up.

The parents have been booked on suspicion of felony child endangerment and false imprisonment.

Their son and his siblings are now in CPS custody.

Investigators will interview other 
relatives who live in the home, and a second family that rents a 
bedroom. They will also speak to neighbors.

The parents are of Vietnamese decent and do not speak English, so police will need to use a translator to interview them.

The discovery comes after a father whose wife allegedly tried to kill their autistic daughter called for more support for families with children who have the condition.

Matt Stapleton, from Elberta, Michigan, said that raising their 15-year-old, Issy, is hard and has brought their family to 'cracking point,' primarily because of her violent attacks.

'We need more research, more support and more therapies to help families manage both the challenges of autism and their own stress,' he told People magazine's latest issue.

However, he condemned his wife Kelli Stapleton's attempt to kill the girl and herself.

'Kelli did something unspeakable,' he said. 'I still love her but I'll never forgive her.'

Mrs Stapleton told police that after years of physical abuse from Issy directed at her and her other children, she 'thought this would be the best solution... if Issy and her went to heaven.'

'This is not an okay act for any parent of an autistic child,' Mr Stapleton told People.

Kelli Stapleton faces a maximum life sentence for attempted murder, with her trial beginning July 16.
