It was supposed to be Britain's cheapest house when it went on sale for just £8,000.

But as property prices rise across the country, a buyer has snapped up a tiny home which has its only toilet outside for nearly double the guide price.

Graham Porter, 53, spent £15,000 on the one-up, one-down terraced home in the Welsh valleys - and is now planning to spend another £20,000 doing it up.

The 100-year-old cottage, in the former mining town of Brynmawr, near Newport, was advertised as Britain’s cheapest property.

With the average home in London now costing in the region of £400,000, Mr Porter bought the home for the price of a small car.

He renovates properties and said he believes he has got a bargain - even though he will have to spend more than a penny knocking down the outhouse and installing an indoor bathroom.

'It may be run down but I’m going to turn it into a little gem. I will have to invest up to £20,000 doing the place up and bringing the toilet inside,' he said.

Rundown: The property was dubbed the cheapest in Britain when it went up for auction with a guide price of £8,000 - however it sold for almost double

'Then it will be a perfect, nice little home.'

Graham and his wife Lena, from Stratford-Upon-Avon, have bought other run down houses to do them up but they think their latest buy is the best bargain yet.

Auctioneer Paul Fosh said: 'Even at a smidge over £15,000 you are talking about buying a house for the price of small car.

'And when you compare it to property prices in London and the rest of the country - this is where the value is.'

The property last changed hands for £16,500 last August, but it was put back on the market.

Across the country average house prices have surged by £14,000, or 8.8 per cent in a single year, rising at their fastest pace since 2010 the latest house price index has revealed.

The Nationwide announced this week that house prices have been rising for 13 consecutive months, the longest unbroken run of monthly increase since the financial crisis began in 2007.

Last year we featured a two-bed home in Burnley, Lancashire that went under the hammer for just £1,000.

That property was so delapidated that it would have taken thousands of pounds to make it liveable, and it is not believed to have sold.

Many parts of the country are currently experiencing a housing boom, but in some areas it is possible to purchase a home for less than the cost of a small car
