'I'm bored!' is a whinge many parents may hear this half term unless their offspring is glued to an iPad or TV screen.

But as more studies have proved this week how children's health and academic performance can improve if they exercise, a sedentary break from school could do them more harm than good.   

So what can parents do to get their children active whilst having fun and being competitive when it doesn't involve an Angry Bird?

Olympic heroes: The Brownlee brothers Jonny, left, and Alistair are encouraging kids to get active this half term

Olympic heroes Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee have the answers. The Yorkshire brothers say there are many easy and affordable ways to get your children moving whilst still having fun.         

Jonny, 23, told MailOnline: 'Active can involve anything. There are so many different ways to get your kids moving - you could build dens, play Pooh sticks, make an assault course or create a treasure hunt. It doesn't have to have too much structure.'

His older brother Alistair, 25, added: 'Our parents were fantastic at giving us 
things to do and showing us how to make fun for ourselves and just 
enjoying being outside and active.'

On your marks: The brothers have grown up competing against one another and love being sporty

The brothers love of being outdoors, running, cycling, swimming - and generally trying to be better than the other at whatever game they played - led to them becoming professional triathletes who took gold (Alistair) and bronze (Jonny) at the London 2012 Olympics.

While sibling rivalry is often frowned upon or seen as a bad thing, the brothers are adamant it is what has driven them to glory.

Jonny explained: 'Sibling rivalry has massively helped our careers. It's taught us how to 
compete and not to be scared of competition. We can learn from each 
other and spur each other on. If Alistair beat me at table tennis in the
garden I would go away and practise to be better so I could beat him. I
think sport can teach a lot of life skills.'

He revealed he may never have become an Olympian if he wasn't inspired or pushed in training by his big brother.

He said: 'I swam and ran anyway but might not have
tried triathlon if it wasn't for Alistair. And I 
definitely wouldn't be as good.

'Alistair is a barrier-breaker with his 
training and racing. Coaches used to tell him when he was younger, "you 
can't do that amount of training" and he said "yes I can".

'I would have 
listened to those coaches and done less training but seeing Alistair do 
it made me realise I could too. I have learnt a lot from him. I remember
when he got his first Great Britain kit, I thought I want that.'

Alistair adds that having his younger brother nipping at his heels has also pushed him to be the best in the world.

'You always want to beat your little brother and him catching up with me pushes me to go forward a bit more,' he said.

Competitive: The brothers love to challenge one another

Get active: The brothers say joining a club and setting a goal is important to keep you motivated

The brothers admit when they younger they were competitive about 'anything and everything' but today they save their rivalry for racing. However, they also support one another when competing where they can, working together on the bike section and giving one another words of encouragement.

And still nursing the pain of being outsprinted by Spaniard Javier Gomez for victory at the ITU World Triathlon Grand Final in September, Jonny admitted if he is ever beaten, he'd rather it was by his brother.

Thanks to their rivalry, the Brownlees were chosen to be brand ambassadors for Warburtons as their latest advert for their Half and Half loaf features two brothers squabbling over who is the best.

Of their involvement with the campaign, which included coming up with the ideas to get children active at half term, Jonny said: 'It was a lot of fun casting our minds back to all the hilarious stuff we got up to playing together as kids. My brother and I spent many a school holiday making up games and challenging each other.'

But aside from the fun activities like break dancing and den building that the Brownlees recommend, what they really want to encourage children to do is find a love of sport like they have.  

For children who want to follow in their footsteps, the brothers, who are now are targetting medals at next year's Commonwealth Games and the Rio 2016 Olympics, recommend joining a club.

Jonny said: 'Parents should encourage their children to try triathlon and show them how
fun it is. Finding a club is important, every area should have one 
local to them now. They can meet new people there and make friends who 
they can compete and train with.'

Alistair said joining a club is also important for adults who want to get fit.

He said: 'Join a club or arrange a time to go out 
with your friends. It's so much easier when you get home from work to 
get out again if you know there's a group session you can join in or 
you're meeting up for a run with your friends.'

Jonny believes that setting a goal, such as a race, will also help children and adults stay motivated.

To this end, the brothers recently staged their own event, the Brownlee Tri, at a National Trust property in Yorkshire. Thousands of people of all ages and abilities took part and it was such a success they hope to do more around the country in the future.

British Triathlon provide information on their website (www.britishtriathlon.org/clubs/index.php) on clubs around the country and how you can join them.

Future Olympians? The Trust have staged events around the country to get children active

A new charity founded last year, the British Triathlon Foundation Trust, is also making strides to get children involved in the sport. They have been visiting schools and staging events around the country where children can have fun whilst competing.

Many of the events for children of all ages involve the traditional swim, bike and run whilst others have sections on scooters or duathlons (races where participants run then cycle then run again). For more information, visit www.britishtriathlonfoundation.org
