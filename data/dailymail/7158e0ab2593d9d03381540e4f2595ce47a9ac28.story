The No 9 might be more commonly associated with football's most deadly strikers, but it's another shirt number which is leading the way when it comes to Premier League goals this season.

Of the 487 strikes in the league since the 2014-15 campaign kicked-off in August, 56 of those have been netted by players with No 10 on their back - 18 more than those sporting No 9.

Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney and Swansea's Wilfried Bony are leading the way for those who wear No 10, with both players having scored eight league goals.

Chelsea forward Eden Hazard, who scored his side's equaliser at Southampton on Sunday, has chipped in with seven goals, while Everton's Romelu Lukaku (six goals) and Burnley's Danny Ings (four) have both made solid contributions to the goals netted by players wearing No 10.

In second place sits the No 9 shirt, which has been worn by the scorers of 38 goals this season.

QPR's in-form centre forward Charlie Austin leads the way with 12 strikes to his name, while Newcastle's Papiss Cisse (nine) and West Ham frontman Andy Carroll (three) have also played a part in the stars wearing the traditional striker's number sitting second in the table.

Helped by the seven goals of West Brom's Saido Berahino, players with the No 18 shirt on their back have been the third most prolific this season.

Hull forward Nikica Jelavic (five), Manchester City's Frank Lampard (four) and Stoke's two-goal hero against West Brom on Sunday, Mame Biram Diouf (five), are also among the No 18s to have hit the back of the net this term.

Summer signing Diego Costa, who joined Chelsea for £32million from Atletico Madrid, has taken to the Premier League with ease and scored his 13th goal of the season against the Hammers on Boxing Day.

Those goals have helped the No 19 shirt sit fourth on our list, with Southampton's Graziano Pelle (eight) and Stoke's Jon Walters (four) among the other contributors to its 32-goal total.

Seven goals apiece from Tottenham's Christian Eriksen and Leicester's Leonardo Ulloa have helped the No 23 into fifth position with 24 goals, while the No 11, 16 and 17 shirts have each bagged 23 goals during the current campaign.

Everton's Kevin Mirallas, who scored against Newcastle on Sunday, is the most prolific No 11 with five goals, while Manchester City's No 16, Sergio Aguero, has already found the back of the net on 14 occasions this term.

West Ham's No 15, Diafra Sakho, has contributed to his shirt number sitting in seventh place in our table having bagged seven league goals since moving to Upton Park last summer.

Spain midfielder David Silva, who scored against Burnley on Sunday, has netted six of the 19 goals by players wearing the No 21 shirt this season.
