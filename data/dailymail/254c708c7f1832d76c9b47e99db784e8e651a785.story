The head of the UN has described the destruction of Gaza as 'beyond description' as he visited the city today following the war between Israel and Palestine this summer.

Ban Ki-Moon was shown entire neighbourhoods of Gaza which were flattened during bombing by Israel, just as efforts at rebuilding the city got underway.

Ban was also shown Hamas tunnels used to attack Israeli soldiers, calling them 'shocking', and adding that Israeli citizens should not have to live under the threat of missile strikes.

Ban Ki-Moon visited Gaza today as efforts to rebuild the city began, describing the devastation as 'beyond description', and was also shown Hamas tunnels used to attack Israeli troops

The conflict this summer killed an estimated 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and another 72 Israelis after tensions in the volatile Middle Eastern region spilled over.

Ban said the destruction he saw in Gaza was 'much more serious' than what he witnessed in the Palestinian territory in 2009 in the aftermath of a previous Israel-Hamas war.

The UN leader said he came to the territory with 'a heavy heart' and told Israeli and Palestinian officials  that 'there is no hope for the long-term stability of Gaza without addressing the underlying causes of the conflict.' 

Two months after the war ended in a stalemate, border restrictions remain largely in place, but today marked the arrival of the first construction materials allowed through Israel's blockade.

Israel has agreed to a UN-monitored system to allow the entry of construction materials, and over the weekend the international community pledged $2.7 billion in reconstruction aid.

Israel, which controls the main cargo crossing into Gaza, called Tuesday's effort a 'pilot' initiative, still wary that building materials could be used by Hamas to rebuild its military infrastructure. 

The UN is monitoring the use of construction materials that pass through the Israeli border crossing, to ensure the materials are not diverted for Hamas military purposes.

Raed Fattouh, the Palestinian Authority coordinator for goods imports to Gaza, said 75 trucks of cement, aggregates and metal supplies were entering Gaza - double the daily average in 2013.

In another move aimed at reconciliation, the Israeli army said it will allow Gaza farmers to sell produce to the West Bank for the first time since Hamas took over Gaza in 2007.

The export ban was one of the most painful restrictions crippling Gaza's economy, because the West Bank used to be the tiny coastal territory's main export market.

In a sign of growing international support for the Palestinians, Ban met with ministers of the new Palestinian unity government in Gaza. 

Learning curve: During his visit, Ban also visited schools that are being run by the UN as part of a relief effort  to help support the thousands left homeless by Israel's bombing campaign this summer

Peace: Ban used the visit to appeal to both sides to address the underlying reasons for the conflict in order to prevent it from happening again

Though Israel has denounced the Palestinian government because it is backed by Hamas, Western governments have signaled a willingness to work with it.

Later, Ban also visited southern Israeli communities that have been battered by years of Gaza rocket fire and consoled the family of a 4-year-old boy killed during the war. 

The military also gave him a tour of the one of the underground tunnels that Hamas built to attack Israeli civilians - the discovery of which prompted Israel's ground invasion in Gaza.

Flattened: Whole neighbourhoods in Gaza were destroyed during Israeli bombing this summer in a conflict which left 2,100 Palestinians dead

On the mend: Rebuilding efforts began in Gaza today after the first shipment of construction materials were allowed through by the Israeli blockade

Ban's visit came amid fresh waves of criticism of Israeli policies as Britain's parliament voted Monday to recognise an independent Palestinian state.

While the Prime Minister abstained , and half of MPs did not vote, the symbolic gesture was designed to send a message to Israel about its approach in Gaza. 

The vote should have no tangible effect on British foreign policy. But Britain's ambassador to Israel warned it symbolizes a trend that should worry the Jewish state. 

Healing: Israel has also lifted a ban on Gazan farmers selling produce on the west bank which they have not been allowed to do since Hamas took control of the city in 2007

Rebuilding: While Israel are fearful that building materials will be diverted by Hamas to rebuild military infrastructure, they have agreed to allow in cement and metal under UN supervision

Change: Israel's slackening of import and export rules around Gaza reflect a wider global political change towards sympathy with Palestine following the conflict this summer
