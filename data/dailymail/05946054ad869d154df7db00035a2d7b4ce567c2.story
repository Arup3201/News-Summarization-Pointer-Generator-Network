College football is in the middle of bowl game season, but for University of Florida running back Adam Lane Jr - it's more like a bowel game.

The Gator was unfortunately caught with an embarrassing mark on his pants after scoring a touchdown in Saturday's Birmingham Bowl game against the East Carolina University Pirates.

Cameras showed Lane's apparently soiled trousers as he jogged to the sidelines after the second quarter score.

Cover up: A team assistant later brought a towel to Lane, who used it to cover up the mark on his pants 

A team assistant was later seen bringing a towel over to Lane, which he used to cover up the mark. 

By the time Lane took the field again, he had changed into a new pair of white spandex. 

While Lane will likely never live down his accident on national TV, as a consolation the freshman was named MVP of the game for his stunning performance leading the pack in rushing. 

The Gators beat the Pirates 28-20. 

Whoops: When Lane later took the field again, he had changed into a new pair of pants (right). Despite the embarrassing moment, Lane came out on top since he was named MVP of the game
