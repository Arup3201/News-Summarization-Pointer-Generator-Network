Self-conscious: Pearl Lowe experienced hair loss and was constantly tired

Designer and former singer Pearl Lowe prides herself on her healthy lifestyle: she gets her five-a-day, eats oily fish regularly, doesn’t drink or smoke and swims every day.

She’s also never ill, rarely even catching a cold.

So, it didn’t make sense when a few years ago, Pearl, 43, started to feel permanently exhausted, her nails became brittle and her hair was getting thinner.

‘I was feeling awful all the time,’ she says. ‘I had no energy and was dragging myself around. I often felt as if I needed a liedown during the day and was ready for bed in the early evening. I couldn’t think why — I live a really healthy lifestyle.

‘I also felt really down and not myself. As I was only 40, not an old woman, I couldn’t work out what was going on.’

It wasn’t only her lack of energy that bothered her — Pearl, who has four children, also had fairly serious hair loss. This had started after the birth of her son Frankie in 1999 when Pearl was 29.

‘I really noticed it on the sides. In fact, I had a bald patch about 5cm wide on the left side near my temple,’ says Pearl, who lives in Somerset. ‘I would try to cover it with my remaining hair, but that was pretty thin, too.

‘It didn’t get any better over the years, and when I washed it, I could see handfuls coming out at once.

‘It became really noticeable that I had this bald patch and generally thinning hair. If I had something special to attend, I would wear a hairpiece that I would clip into the front or a fake ponytail. I even wore a hairpiece for my wedding.

‘When I did photo-shoots, they would automatically airbrush in extra hair, which was really embarrassing.

‘It does affect how you feel about yourself,’ says Pearl who is married to Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey and was famously once one of the Primrose Hill set, along with Kate Moss and Sadie Frost.

Pearl’s thinning hair continued to distress her, but she didn’t see a doctor because she presumed nothing could be done.

However, two years ago she sought medical advice about her fading energy levels.

Her GP took blood tests, which found 
an explanation for her problems: she was anaemic, but more 
significantly, she had an underactive thyroid gland.

Hypothyroidism,
 as it’s known, is a common complaint, affecting at least two in every 
100 people in Britain, though some experts suggest the figure could be 
higher as many spend years undiagnosed.

Living a fuller life: As well as her medication for hypothyroidism and anemia, Pearl began taking a supplement for her hair loss and says she can see a difference already

The thyroid produces the hormone thyroxine, which helps regulate the body’s metabolism and other key processes.

‘If you have too little, the body’s system runs too slowly. That’s why people with an underactive thyroid gland tend to feel lethargic, feel the cold more, have low moods and are prone to putting on weight,’ says Myles Black, a consultant ear, nose and throat and thyroid surgeon at the London Thyroid Clinic and East Kent Hospitals University Trust.

Hair loss is also common. This may be because the condition slows down the normal turnover of cells, which can include new hair cells.

Other symptoms include finding your mind works slower than normal, constipation, dry skin and brittle nails, palpitations, aching muscles and irregular or heavy periods. Typically, it’s caused when the body’s own defences turn on it and produce antibodies to attack the thyroid gland.

Hypothyroidism is ten times more common in women, possibly because auto-immune conditions tend to affect more women than men.

‘The thyroid gland becomes inflamed and scar tissue forms, which means it is able to pump out less and less thyroxine,’ says Mr Black.

Some patients develop it as a result of damage to the thyroid following surgery or radiotherapy, or as a result of side-effects from medication such as lithium.

Childbirth can also be a trigger, because it leads to a brief time of having an over-active thyroid gland, which can damage the thyroid and eventually leave it underactive.

‘Most people who go to their doctors complaining of tiredness will be given a standard battery of blood tests, which involves a test to check for levels of thyroxine [also known as T4] and thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH,’ adds Mr Black.

If it shows low levels, some doctors then choose to give patients another blood test that measures antibodies to the thyroid gland. If present, it shows that the antibodies have caused the problem. But not everyone who has the symptoms of low thyroid function gets a test.

‘The problem is that it’s mainly women who are affected,’ says Lyn Mynott, chief executive of the charity Thyroid UK.

‘Women go in and the doctor says: “Of course you’re tired and achy — you have young children.” Then they go back years later and the doctor say: “Of course you’re tired and achy — you’re going through the menopause.” ’

The other problem is that women who have had an underactive thyroid may have low moods and sometimes doctors think they are just depressed.

‘We’ve heard from women who have gone to their doctor and the doctor focuses on the low mood,’ says Lyn. ‘Actually, they aren’t depressed — their low mood is due to hypo- thyroidism, so they end up taking antidepressants unnecessarily.’

Another complication is that people’s needs for thyroxine differ. While some develop almost no symptoms even though they have low thyroxine levels, others have symptoms of hypothyroidism even when they are on the borderline of a healthy thyroxine level.

Once diagnosed, treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine tablets. When Pearl was diagnosed, the doctor explained that as well as low energy and low mood, it could have explained why she had suffered a miscarriage three years earlier. Studies have linked hypothyroidism to an increased risk of miscarriage.

‘At the time I was devastated,’ says Pearl. ‘It also explained why I was struggling to lose weight. I had been really skinny, but had gradually put on a stone and couldn’t shift it.’

‘Levothyroxine tablets have helped my energy and mood no end. I felt like my old self again. But it didn’t do much for my hair.’

This could have been down to her anaemia as well as an underactive thyroid. Anaemia is a key trigger for hair loss in women, says Dr Bessam Farjo, a hair transplant surgeon who works in London and Manchester.

‘I ask every woman who comes to me for help with hair loss to first have a blood test to rule out an underlying medical condition such as hypothyroidism, which could trigger it,’ he says.

‘However, the most common cause by far to be picked up this way in women is anaemia. This is because iron is needed to help make protein and hair is essentially dead protein.’

A friend suggested Pearl try a supplement called Viviscal, which contains iron, vitamin C, silica and a marine protein complex.

‘I started taking it only six months ago and my hair feels so much fuller,’ says Pearl, who is the mother of model Daisy Lowe, 24.

A multi-centre study suggested the supplement may thicken hair and reduce shedding. When 72 women with hair loss were given it or a placebo, those who had the supplement had reduced shedding and their hair shaft width increased after three months. The full study will be published later this year.

Meanwhile, Pearl is happy to finally have ‘everything sorted’. ‘I don’t feel like a tired old woman any more, and my hair no longer gets me down.’
