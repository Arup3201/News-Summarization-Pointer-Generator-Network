Former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness has criticised Manuel Pellegrini making an astonishing Champions League gaffe.

The Manchester City manager failed to realise that one more goal against Bayern Munich would have seen the English club finish top of Champions League Group D... and they had a full 28 minutes to try to score it!

James Milner scored in the 62nd minute to put City 3-2 up at the Allianz Arena, leaving Pellegrini's side requiring a solitary goal to leapfrog the Germans at the top of the group thanks to a superior head-to-head record.

A 4-2 result City would have seen them avoid the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid in the knockout stages.

Leading goalscorer Sergio Aguero was left sitting on the bench as Pellegrini waited until the 88th minute to make his final substitution, replacing striker Edin Dzeko with midfielder Jack Rodwell. 

Souness, working as a pundit on Sky Sports, was clearly bemused. He said: ‘I’m not sure he’s understanding the goal difference here. It has to be the strangest substitution this season in taking off Dzeko, a centre forward, and putting on Rodwell, who at best is an attacking midfielder.

Confusion: Pellegrini said he was tempted to bring Aguero on if City scored the fourth, but they only needed one

Mishap: Pellegrini brought off Edin Dzeko in the closing stages and brought on Jack Rodwell

SKY SPORTS: You're 3-2 up, you've got quite a bit of time to get this goal which would have topped the group, were you not tempted to put on (Sergio) Aguero, your best striker?

PELLEGRINI: I was tempted if we scored the fourth goal of course, that's why I sent out Aguero to warm up but also I think that it was a risk to continue with (David) Silva, he can't play more than 70 minutes.

'I would suggest that they've not 
spoken about it and he wasn't aware. Maybe the guys he's sitting with on
the bench, Brian Kidd and his other coach, had not spoken about it and 
weren't aware that 4-2 gets them through.

'When
he says (in his post-match interview), 'if we'd got another goal, I'd 
told Aguero to warm up', it tells you he's thinking he needs to get 
five. It was one of the strangest substitutions I've seen in a long 
time.'

Pellegrini admitted that he would only
have put on Aguero if City had made it 4-2.

Man City could have gone through with another goal, based on their head-to-head record against Bayern

Second place: Pellegrini said it 'was difficult to score two goals' with the score at 3-2, but City only one

Turnaround: James Milner wheels away after putting City 3-2 ahead in Munich having been 2-0 down

‘Maybe if we had scored a 
fourth goal I would have made the change,’ said the confused Chilean 
coach. ‘It was important to be first in the group but not the most 
important.

‘Arsenal on Sunday was a priority above this game. I said it was very difficult to win by three goals.’

James Milner, who scored the winning 
goal with 28 minutes left, said: ‘We’re slightly disappointed we did 
not finish top of the group.

No holding back: Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness

'We didn’t know if 4-2 would be enough or if
we would need 5-2. We thought it needed to be 5-2 to be honest.’

Sky Sports analysts Souness, 
Glenn Hoddle and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher were all left baffled by Pellegrini’s decision.

Hoddle added: ‘Does he understand that 4-2 puts him through (as group leaders). ‘There’s no urgency to make a substitution.’

Carragher said: ‘He must know he can’t
play any English team and the ones left — Barcelona, Real Madrid, maybe
Atletico Madrid — could be massive.’

Pep Guardiola said: 'I would like to 
congratulate Man C for this great victory. It is never good to lose 
again but maybe this club the manager and the team sometimes we need a 
defeat because we always win everything, in the Bundesliga, in Europe.

'We
have started very well in the Bundesliga in the cup, we won in 
Manchester. You always think everything is easy, but Europe is very 
difficult so maybe it is good for us for Maracech next Saturday.

'We played really well in the first 30 minutes. Then first ten mins in second half Manchester City were better than us. In general we are satisfied for Bayern.

'I hope we can see how difficult it is playing in Europe, sometimes things like this happen and we have to understand and learn our lessons from this. We have to understand how difficult it is to win all the time, so we are ready for the knockout stages.

'We have got to realise we can also lose. We are a great team, a super team but we can also lose, because the other teams are good.

'They started really well, they were really focussed. But if you are not in control of the game... the passes between our players were not good, we must use the ball better and do something with it.

'Manchester City are not a bad team, you cannot score against them with just 2-3 touches.

'They shot 4 times on our go, in the first 15 minutes of the second half they were better than us, just that little period, maybe we were level for the last 15 of the first half. The rest of the time we were better.'

A similar incident resulted in Manchester City's relegation in the 1995-96 season, with Alan Ball in charge at Maine Road.

Battling
against relegation and playing Liverpool on the final day of the 
season, City conceded two own-goals before drawing level through Uwe 
Rosler and Kit Symons.

World Cup winner Ball knew his side 
needed to do better than Southampton and Coventry to survive - so when 
he got word that Wimbledon were beating Saints late on he instructed 
City to play out time.

Steve
Lomas was playing keep ball near the corner flag when the recently 
substituted Niall Quinn ran out of the tunnel to tell his team-mates 
otherwise - Wimbledon were not winning.

But
it was too late to find a winner, and City were relegated. Ball (below) left 
the club three games into the following season in Division One.
