Supermarket staff have been grassed up by shoppers for trying to flog discounted plants - despite them looking dead.

Customers at Aldo spotted the drooping pot plants and wilted ornamental grasses outside a branch in Exeter, Devon.

They claim workers have continued to wheel out the withering greenery for the past week without realising it’s all gone to pot.

Withered: The shabby plants on sale at an Aldi in Exeter. Locals say the plants have been on sale for a week, despite obviously being dead

Still not a bargain: Despite the price being slashed from £2.59 to £1.99, shoppers haven't been tempted

The plants were still on sale today for £1.99 each, despite much of the foliage literally withering on the vines.

A shopper said: 'I noticed these plants looking the worse for wear last week and was amazed to find what looks like the same batch still on sale several days later.

'A member of staff must be wheeling them out each morning oblivious to the fact these plants are as dead as a Monty Python parrot.

'The manager told me he was watering them but it looks far too late to save them. I know Aldi shoppers like a bargain but nobody wants a dead plant.'

Bosses at Aldi - whose slogan is Spend a Little, Live a Lot - are yet to comment.

The petals on these flowers are turning brown at the edge - but they are still on sale
