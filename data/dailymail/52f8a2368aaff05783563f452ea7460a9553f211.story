Whether you’re rowing your boat, winding the bobbin up or doing the Hokey Cokey, having a little boogie with your baby can do more than just entertain them, according to research.

The new study has found that moving in sync with your tot can actually turn them into more helpful children.

Bouncing at the same time to music with 14-month-old babies encourages them to display altruistic behaviour, the study from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, found.

Bouncing in unison with your baby can encourage them to be more helpful little beings, the study found

Laura Cirelli, lead author of the new paper, due to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Developmental Science, said: '‘Movement is a fundamental part of music that affects social behaviour from a very young age.'

Cirelli, and her colleagues in the department of psychology, neuroscience and behaviour, showed that 14-month-old babies were much more likely to help an adult person after the experience of bouncing up and down in time to music with them.

Bounce in sync with your baby and reap the rewards of their helpful behaviour

Cirelli 
and fellow doctoral student Kate Einarson tested 68 babies, many of whom
 could not yet walk, to see if bouncing to music with another person 
made them more likely to assist that person.

Some babies were bounced in sync with a researcher standing opposite them while others were bounced at a different tempo.

When the song was over, the researcher performed several simple tasks, including drawing a picture with a marker.

While drawing she would pretend to drop the marker to see whether the infant would pick it up and hand it back to her – a test of altruism in babies.

The babies who had been bounced in time with the researcher were much more likely to toddle over, pick up the object and pass it back to the researcher, compared to infants who had been bounced at a different tempo.

The findings suggest that when we sing, clap, bounce or dance in time to music with our babies, these shared experiences of synchronous movement help form social bonds between adults and babies.
