It’s certainly rather different to sitting outside all day with a fishing rod and bait to catch your dinner.

Residents of Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province in China, were delighted to find yesterday that they could chip free frozen fish from an icy river.

A section of the river was drained last month due to the construction of a nearby metro line - leaving only a shallow amount of water, according to local environmental protection bureau officials.

One said: ‘Due to the low temperature and shallow water, the fish were killed by the frozen water.’
