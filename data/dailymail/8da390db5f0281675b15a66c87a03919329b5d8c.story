Growing up in Tennessee, where her mother worked as a university professor, Satara Stratton had dreamed of escaping to Hollywood to become a movie star.

But just eight months after the 24-year-old made the leap to pursue that dream, she has been reported missing and is believed to have become swept up in the city's seedy underworld.

Her mother Sharon Stratton, who has not heard from her daughter since November, believes she is addicted to heroin and under the influence of a registered sex offender.

Satara, whose stage name is Satara Silver, left home in June 2011 for the West Coast, where she enjoyed early success in a handful of films, including a horror flick called Cult Movie.

Determined to make a success of her new life, the petite blonde also began taking classes and started a job at the Disney Store on Santa Monica Boulevard.

But it was short lived, as she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, causing her to miss a semester of school, her mother told the Los Angeles Times.

She added that her daughter's troubles worsened when a fellow employee began extorting money from her and harassing her.

While making a film, Satara met 46-year-old registered sex offender Paul Constantinescu, who runs a rubber stamp company on Santa Monica Boulevard, according to the LA Times.

Police
have arrested her on several occasions, with her mugshots documenting 
how her life appears to be spiralling out of control. Arrests have 
included possession of narcotics 
in a hospital.

Los Angeles police are now looking for Stratton, as well as Constantinescu, with whom she is friends on Facebook. Investigators have visited Constantinescu's address, but he was not there.

On the state's Megan's Law website, Constantinescu's offenses are listed as attempted lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 14 and attempted forced oral copulation with a minor under 14.

Detective Carmine Sasso of the LAPD's Missing Persons Unit told the Culver City Patch that Constantinescu
is not accused of any wrongdoing.

But he added that authorities have released his photo as
Stratton has 'been seen with him, and if he pops up, maybe he can say, 
"Oh, she's over there".'

'We're
doing all we can to generate feedback,' he told the Patch. 
'The mother is very concerned because [Stratton] is looking worse and 
worse in the photos we have.'

He said she has been spotted at the 
6500 block of Santa Monica Boulevard in the heart of Hollywood and 
appealed to the public for further information. He added that her 
situation is not unique.

'These
young people come out from another state, some small town, to a 
multimillion population, trying to hit it big and they get caught up,' 
he said. 'You have these predators who prey on these individuals.'

Job: Satara was working at a Hollywood Disney Store when she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, missing a term of school. Her mother said that is where her problems began

Police are considering her 'voluntarily missing' - but her mother refuses to believe it, saying that Satara was always in touch regularly.

The last time Sharon spoke to her daughter was in November to arrange for Satara to see her grandmother before she died.

Satara’s grandmother, with whom she was close, died in January and 'she would never have missed that', Sharon told the LA Times.

'She had never, ever done anything until these men came into her life. She wasn’t into drugs,' she added.

Sharon wrote a blog post for the 
Examiner.com in which she claimed her daughter was in the custody of 
'stalker turned abductor Paul Constantinesco - he and his group place 
Satara into life threatening situations via use of drugs, and coercion 
through violence', according to the Patch.

She later posted a message calling for help on Facebook, writing that her daughter 'has health issues risk to life, and previous torture by this man lead to suicidal ideas, and he forced drugs'.

Authorities would not divulge the nature of her health issues.

On her Facebook page, the concerned mother wrote: 'Satara is not voluntarily missing; she has had no contact with not only family but friends throughout this occurrence.'

Sasso added: 'On the surface, she’s an adult and can do whatever she wants.

'But you start digging below the surface and you find these connections and you can’t ignore these connections. So where is she?'

Hunt: Satara is noted as 'voluntarily missing' but her mother disputes this, saying they spoke every day
