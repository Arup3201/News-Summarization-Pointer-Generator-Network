Harry Redknapp called it, when he said Arsenal were his dark horses for the Champions League.

Praise from an unlikely source given he was manager of their bitter rivals Tottenham less than three years ago.

Recent history would suggest Redknapp is wrong - they have exited the competition at the last-16 stage in their previous four seasons - but Arsenal appear poised to amount a serious assault on one of the few trophies to elude manager Arsene Wenger during his 18 years at the club.

GETTING INTO THEIR STRIDE

Like a nervous-yet-primed 100m sprinter, Arsenal have uncurled from their delayed push out of the starting blocks and are starting to open out and power towards the finish line. Perfect timing for a Champions League charge.

They have won 10 of their last 12 matches in all competitions and are on a run of nine straight home wins, which began back in November.

Hitting form has coincided with Olivier Giroud netting eight in his past 11 games, taking some of the pressure off free-scoring Alexis Sanchez.

DAT GUY WELBZ

Back in February 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson surprised many when he included Danny Welbeck, facing a difficult second season after breaking into the Manchester United first team and up until that point have only scored once, to face Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the first leg of their knockout double header.

Welbeck responded brilliantly. He upstaged Wayne Rooney after scoring early on from his team-mate’s corner in a 1-1 draw. Ferguson said afterwards: ‘They found it difficult to handle him. He was marvellous. He worked so hard.’

His work-rate, which often comes at the detriment to goals, should not be underestimated and could prove crucial in key Champions League ties.

LUCK OF THE DRAW

Arsenal only finished runners-up in their group and could have faced Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Monaco, Bayern Munich, Barcelona or Porto. The French Ligue 1 side are arguably the easiest draw of the lot.

Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United have all demonstrated in previous years that a sprinkle of the magic stuff can help to win the competition.

It takes monumental comebacks, penalty shootout victories or sometimes two goals deep into stoppage-time to win Europe’s greatest club competition.

Drawing Monaco could be the bit of luck Arsenal need.

COQ-A-HOOP

Arsene Wenger has been delighted with the emergence of defensive midfielder Francis Coquelin from exiled to exceptional.

He appeared on his way out of the club until a spate of injuries forced Wenger’s hand. Coquelin has excelled, mopping up in front of the back four. Arsenal have so many midfield options, but the problem is none of them want to defend and Coquelin is the enforcer they were so badly lacking.

He was offered a new contract in January, which he signed this month. 'I saw that he made huge improvements in training so I sent him on loan for match practice,’ Wenger said. ‘He took that challenge and he's done very well. He is a long-term solution.’

INJURIES ABATING

Fourteen players have missed chunks of this season with injuries this season. Fourteen. That’s almost an entire starting XI and substitutes bench. And most of them have been first-team players.

They’ll have to get a revolving door installed in the treatment room fairly soon if this continues.

But key players are returning and the pressure is easing on the final run-in. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere are all on their way back and Theo Walcott is playing again after a year out.

They have also missed the likes of Mesut Ozil, Giroud and Laurent Koscielny who are now back to full fitness.
