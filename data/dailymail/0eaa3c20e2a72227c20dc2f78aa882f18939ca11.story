A 20-year-old woman was gang-raped, killed and hanged from a tree in Pakistan in a case that bears a chilling resemblance to a double rape and murder that caused outrage in neighbouring India last month.

Pakistani police said Muzammil Bibi was attacked by three men in a field in the impoverished Layyah area of densely populated Punjab province.

Senior officer Sadaqat Ali Chohan said: 'This is the first time in my 22 years of service in the police that I have seen such a case, where a girl was raped in this way and found hanging from a tree.

'We have heard of such cases in India but never in Pakistan. The girl's clothes were torn. We took her down and moved her to hospital.

'Her body had signs of resistance. We have arrested three individuals who have confessed to the crime.'

According to police, the 20-year-old resisted the rape and her attackers strangled her.

Police said her parents spent all night looking for her and found her body hanging the next morning.

In a shockingly similar crime which took place in May, two teenage cousins were found hanging from a tree after being raped in the north of India.

Three men have been arrested over the killings. Two policemen were held on suspicion of trying to cover up the crime.

Shortly after the incident, a lawmaker
 from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party described 
rape as a social crime, saying 'sometimes it's right, sometimes it's 
wrong.'

The controversial remarks came as
 political leaders of Uttar Pradesh - the state where the two cousins aged 12
 and 14 were raped and hanged - faced criticism for 
failing to visit the scene.

Another
 regional politician from Modi's party, the Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP), said the crime of rape could only be considered to
 have been committed if it is reported to police.

In yet another incident earlier this month, another woman, who was just 19 years old was also found dead hanging from a tree in India - becoming the fourth 
woman from the same state to die in this way.

The
 woman had gone missing from her house in Rajpura village in Uttar 
Pradesh before family members said they went to report the matter to 
police in nearby Thakurdwara.

Her
 body was then discovered outside a village in Moradabad district, 
around three hours from Delhi, police said. Her family say she was 
raped.

Despite a rape being reported in India every 21 minutes on average, law 
enforcement failures mean that such crimes are often not reported.

The cases have triggered a debate throughout the region about violence against women.
