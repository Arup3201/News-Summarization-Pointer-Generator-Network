Mystery: Russell Matthews reappeared in January after vanishing and being declared a missing person more than three months before

A man who served for more than 15 years in the Coast Guard has miraculously reappeared after being declared missing more than three months ago, Honolulu police and the Coast Guard said on Tuesday.

Petty Officer First Class Russell Matthews, who worked as a rescue swimmer, returned to his home in Hawaii on Sunday night after he was presumed dead.

Officials said he was incoherent and taken to a military hospital for observation.

Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Gene 
Maestas said the service doesn't know where Matthews, a Hawaii-based 
rescue swimmer, has been and what he's been doing since his new wife 
reported him missing on October 9.

Matthews had been married once before and tragically lost his first wife, Clara, in 2011.

The mother of his two children committed suicide in 2011 by shooting herself in the head; Matthews went missing around the one-year anniversary of her death, according to KITV.

Authorities suspect that Matthews’ first wife pointed the gun at her head in part because of the traumatic brain injury she suffered two years prior in a bicycle accident.

Tragedy: Clara and her children were involved in a head-on bicycling accident in 2009 and the mother suffered a traumatic brain injury; two years later, she committed suicide

According to reports at the time, Clara was hit by a car as she was riding her bicycle along the North Shore in Pupukea in March of 2009. Her two children, aged three and five, were riding along in a two-wheel trailer.

Clara and her children were seriously injured when a woman veered her sedan into the bike lane and hit the family head-on.

The mother was thrown from her bicycle and hit her head on the car’s windshield, while her children were pushed by the car around 80 feet, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.

According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Matthews was being investigated for marijuana use at the time of his disappearance.

Coast
 Guard investigators dispatched to see him confirmed his identity after 
he called his command from Castle Medical Center in the Honolulu suburb 
of Kailua, Maestas said.

He's now being evaluated at Tripler Army 
Medical Center in Honolulu.

Coast
 Guard investigators looking into his disappearance won't question him 
until he's released by doctors, Maestas said. But the service will probe
 the incident.

Matthews' children have been staying with Clara's family members in his absence, KITV reports. The ABC affiliate adds that the rescue diver could face charges for going AWOL.

'We'll try to find out why he disappeared and all the details surrounding his case,' he said.

Police
 found the 36-year-old guardsman's car abandoned at Kaena Point, a 
remote area of Oahu, when Matthews was reported missing in October.

Crews from the Coast Guard, Navy, 
state, county lifeguards and Honolulu fire and police departments 
together searched more than 10,000 nautical square miles - on land and 
at sea - for Matthews.

The search was called off on December 13.

Honolulu
 Police Sgt. Kim Buffett of Crimestoppers said Matthews isn't giving the
 police a statement because he's in the hospital. Detectives have no 
reason to pursue the case as it's not against the law to be missing, she
 said.

The police case is closed now that Matthews has been found, she said.

It's unusual for a Guardsman to go missing for months and then reappear, Maestas said.

'This is not the norm for the Coast Guard. In my 28 year career in the Coast Guard, I have never come across a case like this,' he said.

Matthews, an aviation survival technician, has been in the Coast Guard for 15 years. He's been assigned to Hawaii since 2007.
