Marco Fu became the third shock exit in two days at the Shanghai Masters, slipping up to 17-year-old Chinese prospect Zhao Xintong.

Teenager Zhao was runner-up at last year's World Amateur Championships and stunned world number eight Fu with a 5-4 first-round victory on Wednesday.

Fu followed Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan out of the Shanghai event in the first round, with nine of the 16 seeds already eliminated.

Zhao clinched the final frame 65-64 after sinking the decisive black ball to complete a match-winning break of 64.

'For one moment I was very shocked. It was only after I potted the last black that I realised I had won the match by only one point,' said Zhao, who faces Fergal O'Brien in the second round.

World champion Mark Selby dispatched Ken Doherty 5-2, with a top break of 99.

Stephen Maguire eased past Jimmy Robertson 5-1, while Mark Allen defeated Andrew Higginson 5-3.
