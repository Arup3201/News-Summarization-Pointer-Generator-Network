Overdose: Carol Tsoi committed suicide hours before her husband was due to appear in court

A wife who was ‘terrified’ about the outcome of her husband's court appearance for sex crimes took a fatal drugs overdose - just hours before he was cleared of all charges, an inquest heard.

Carol Tsoi, 64, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, committed suicide hours before her husband Kam was due to appear in court, charged with historic sex offences against four young girls.

She was said to have been very anxious about Mr Tsoi's hearing - and this distress came on top of existing significant medical problems and the trauma of a recent bereavement.

Mrs Tsoi did not leave a suicide note and had told her own doctor that she wanted to attend the trial at Liverpool Crown Court to support her 66-year-old husband.

Bolton Coroner's Court was told she appeared to be in a positive mood when the whole family left their home in Wigan on October 12 last year to attend to a car boot sale.

But Wigan assistant coroner Geoffrey Saul found that the 64-year-old supervisor took her own life later that day or early the next morning.

She had retired to her own bedroom early in the evening, having declined an evening meal, and bolted the door from the inside.

The discovery was made the following morning by son Michael, who had been staying over with his wife and children. She was lying face down on the floor next to her bed and was ‘clearly deceased’.

Ex-soldier Michael had been forced to shoulder-charge the bungalow's bedroom door open after his mother failed to answer pleas to come for the breakfast which his chef father Mr Tsoi was cooking.

The hearing was told Mrs Tsoi was already being treated for depression following the death of her own father and the loss of her pet dog Izzy.

Mrs Tsoi was also battling diabetes, asthma, increasing problems with arthritis - for which she was facing a future hip transplant - and problems with sporadic alcohol dependency.

She had undergone a gastric band operation in an effort to control her weight but was also suffering from bowel problems.

Shortly after Mrs Tsoi's death, the inquest was told, Mr Tsoi - who did not attend - was acquitted in court of nine counts of alleged historic sex crimes against four young girls.

Dr Stephen Wells, a pathologist at Wigan Infirmary, confirmed that Mrs Tsoi had died because of an overdose of drugs. Police ruled out foul play or trauma.

In a statement submitted on behalf of her own GP Dr Sanjay Wahie, Mrs Tsoi was said to have had no thoughts about suicide or self-harm in her consultations with him.

'It was just one thing after another and she never fully recovered from something before there was something else. She was terrified about the court case and what may happen. I think she had had enough'

Although she was concerned about the ‘accusations’ made against her husband and the forth coming court case, she ‘wanted to be there for him’.

Michael Tsoi, her eldest son, told the inquest that the day before her death had been normal, with all the family visiting a car boot sale and then making arrangements to have a family car collected to be scrapped.

He said that, since the gastric band operation, it was ‘quite common’ for his mother to decline an evening meal or to retire to her own bedroom earlier than the rest of the family, to read.

He added that Mrs Tsoi had been locked in a downward spiral of physical and mental health issues.

She had been treated at hospital for an anxiety attack and was deeply affected by the death of her grandfather and the family pet.

He said: ‘It was just one thing after another and she never fully recovered from something before there was something else. She was terrified about the court case and what may happen. I think she had had enough.’
