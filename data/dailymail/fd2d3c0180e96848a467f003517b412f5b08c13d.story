The magic of Disney has been taken to new heights after 80 metre high characters were projected onto The White Cliffs of Dover.

Buzz Lightyear was just one of an all-star cast of cartoons which lit up the famous landmark in Kent and greeted excited visitors as they crossed the Channel.

The hero space ranger was joined by fearless pirate Captain Jack Sparrow and super hero dad Mr Incredible as they stood at a whopping 80 metres high by 500 metres wide.

Making a statement: The parade's full line up included 
Buzz Lightyear and Jessie (Toy Story), Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones 
(Pirates of the Caribbean), Mr. & Mrs. Incredible (The Incredibles),
Mike Wazowski and Sulley (Monsters University) and The Lone Ranger and 
Tonto (The Lone Ranger)

The illuminations signalled the start of the first Digital Disney Parade which saw projected characters turn London into a city-sized playground as they ran amok across the famous landmarks.

The iconic characters also marked the arrival of Disney Infinity, an all-new gaming universe where players can create their own adventures with characters like never before.

Joss Hastings, from Disney UK, said: 'Disney Infinity creates a virtual toy box where fans can play with all their favourite characters together and design their own adventures.

'What better way to celebrate the 
launch of the game in the UK than with the first Digital Disney Parade, 
showing the characters making their own fun in London.'

The
parade's full line up included Buzz Lightyear and Jessie (Toy Story), 
Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean), Mr. & Mrs. 
Incredible (The Incredibles), Mike Wazowski and Sulley (Monsters 
University) and The Lone Ranger and Tonto (The Lone Ranger).

Iconic: The White Cliffs of Dover are cliffs 
which form part of the English coastline and face the Strait of Dover 
and France, reaching 350 feet. They spread both east and west from Dover
in Kent and are symbolic as they guard against invasions

It's not the first time famous faces have been projected on to the famous coastline, made famous by Dame Vera Lynn with her spirit-lifting Second World War son starting with the line 'There'll be bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover.'

David Beckham was beamed on to the cliffs as part of a H&M marketing stunt to promote his new intimates range.

The White Cliffs of Dover are cliffs which form part of the English coastline and face the Strait of Dover and France, reaching 350 feet. They spread both east and west from Dover in Kent and are symbolic as they guard against invasions.

They are also the first or last sight for those travelling to and from the UK because crossing at Dover was the primary route to the continent before air travel was developed.
