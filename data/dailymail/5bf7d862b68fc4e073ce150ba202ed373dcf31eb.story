The Duchess of Cambridge said she was taking flying lessons - but the suggestion Prince Harry is her instructor has not been confirmed

The Duchess of Cambridge has revealed she's learning to fly a plane - and she may even be being taught by Prince Harry.

The 31-year-old, who gave heart to other new mothers by appearing with what looked like a few grey roots, told a group of RAF officers that she had been taking lessons in a fixed-wing aircraft, as opposed to the helicopters flown by both her husband and brother-in-law.

Kate, whose father was a dispatcher for British Airways and mother was an airline hostess, said: 'My grandfather [the late RAF pilot Peter Middleton] flew planes.  I've had a few lessons on fixed wing.'

But Kensington Palace would not confirm the rumour that Kate was being taught by her Apache helicopter commander brother-in-law.  Prince Harry took lessons in flying fixed wing planes at the Army Air Corps base in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, in 2008.

The Duchess of Cambridge looked as elegant as ever as she helped promote the Poppy Appeal in London yesterday.

She and her husband, Prince William, surprised commuters at High Street Kensington underground station yesterday when they made the short journey from their home in Kensington Palace on a classic 1960s London Routemaster bus, accompanied by forces personnel and poppy sellers.

They were helping to promote a Royal British Legion effort to raise £1million for forces charities in a single day in the capital.

Prince William seemed to enjoy his rare trip on the bus, saying: ‘It’s very sociable. Although I suppose everyone’s got their earphones in.’

Among their party was actress Barbara Windsor, who asked after baby George. Kate replied: ‘He’s half asleep,’ gesturing towards the apartment they share in the Palace. William added: ‘He’s behaving himself this morning.’

A slender-looking Kate chose a £345 red coat by LK Bennett for the occasion, to match the three poppies pinned on to the lapel. She was also sporting a slightly different hairstyle, parted in the middle rather than to one side.

According to sources Kate normally enhances her sleek hairstyle with an organic vegetable-based colour wash and subtle low lights at the Richard Ward salon in Chelsea.

But yesterday a few grey hairs could be seen, perhaps suggesting that Kate has, like many breastfeeding women, decided not to dye or highlight her hair.

The couple were mobbed as they arrived at the tube station yesterday morning.

Lisa Durchstecher, 24, from Hanover, who had just arrived at the station to take a tour of Kensington Palace, said: ‘We came from Germany to see Kensington Palace. This is a dream come true. We were screaming.’

William, who left his operational role in the RAF two months ago for a ‘transitional year’ of royal duties mixed with charity projects, told wellwishers he was missing flying search and rescue helicopters but enjoying the young family’s more settled life in London.

‘It’s quite nice being in one place,’ he said.

The couple also spoke to Serena Alexander, 58, from Hammersmith, west London, whose son, Marine Sam Alexander, was killed by an improved explosive device in Afghanistan in 2011.

As fundraisers prepared to scramble aboard the Routemaster bus, Mrs Alexander remembered her son, who was awarded the Military Cross, saying: ‘He loved a party. He would have thought this bus was a really good idea.’

Unfortunately, Kate and William were unable to take the bus back to the Palace – the huge crowds at the station meant the couple had to jump in an official car instead.

Peter Middleton served as an RAF fighter pilot who used the wing tips of his Mosquito warplane to divert deadly German 'doodlebug' flying bombs away from London.

Kate was close to her grandfather, and after his death at the age of 90 in 201, she delayed the announcement of her engagement to Prince William by several days.

Flying Officer Middleton was posted to the No 37 Service Flying School in Calgary in 1942, when he was a volunteer reservist aged just 22, and spent two-and-a-half years as an instructor, training Spitfire, Hurricane and Lancaster pilots.

Later he became an unsung hero in the air war against Hitler's Luftwaffe, after joining the reservist 605 Squadron at Manston, near Ramsgate, Kent, in August 1944.

Showing incredible courage, he was deployed in a de Havilland Mosquito fighter bomber to nudge the wings of unmanned German V1 flying missiles to divert them from London.

The deadly 'doodlebugs', launched from France, could each destroy at least three houses. About 8,000 were launched at Britain and more than 2,000 hit London, killing thousands.

Middleton was among a group of elite RAF 'top guns' used to push the V1s off-course. Despite risking his life on an almost nightly basis, it is not thought that he received an honour for his bravery.

After being demobbed in 1946, Middleton flew Tridents with British European Airways, a forerunner of British Airways. And in 1962, he made the Middleton family's first direct royal connection when he acted as First Officer to the Duke of Edinburgh on a two-month flying tour of South America.

Prince Philip piloted 49 of the tour's 62 flights, often with Middleton -- who had been specially chosen for the tour by BEA -- by his side. Middleton was later sent a letter of thanks and a pair of gold cufflinks from Buckingham Palace.
