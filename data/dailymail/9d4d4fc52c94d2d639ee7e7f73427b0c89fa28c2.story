Smash hit: Author EL James posing with her book Fifty Shades of Grey at a book signing

They were the undisputed literary hits of the summer breaking all sorts of records as copies flew off the shelves at unimaginable speed.

But rather than enjoying racy scenes featuring Anastasia and Christian Grey, a quarterly magazine has taken a more analytical approach to reading EL James' 'Fifty Shades of Grey' trilogy.

Journalists at Delayed Gratification trawled through all three books - Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Free - to find out just how much of the novels was about sex and to highlight the kinkiest moments.

Each successive novel was found to feature less sex than its predecessor but the later books did score higher on the kinkiness scale.

Readers reached the sexiest scenes earlier in the second and third books after having to trawl through 80 pages of Fifty Shades of Grey to reach the saucy stuff.

The statistics show that the first book in the trilogy, Fifty Shades of Grey, was made up of 13 per cent sex, that's 71 out of 528 pages.

The kinkiest highlights for readers, according to the statistics, included Grey's 'red room of pain' and the employment of leather handcuffs, eye masks and a flagellation device.

The second book, Fifty Shades Darker, features less sex, making up 11 per cent of the book or 62 pages out of 544.

Readers found scenes where a silk tie and massage oil were used as among the most titillating.

Finally, the trilogy's last outing, Fifty Shades Freed, featured the least sex with eight per cent or 50 pages of 592.

Among the hottest highlights was a sadomasochistic scene featuring flagellation.

Delayed Gratification editor Rob Orchard told The Economist: 'The idea to pull together the data came from that old story about copies of "Lady Chatterley's Lover" falling open on the "interesting" bits, which made us think we should provide a user's guide to the "Fifty Shades" books.

'We were spurred on by the secret code we kept hearing between people reading the books on the train–"Have you reached page 348 yet?"'

Fifty Shades of Grey, James' first book, tells of the sadomasochistic affair between wealthy entrepreneur Christian Grey and naïve literature student Anastasia Steele.

Widely dubbed 'mummy porn', the steamy novel topped book charts all over the world following its release in 2011, selling more than 4 million copies in print and on Kindle at Amazon's UK website alone between March and August 2012.

The x-rated book broke a separate British record in June when it became the fastest paperback to hit one million sales, taking 11 weeks to reach the mark.

The trilogy's first offering even outsold all seven Harry Potter books on website Amazon.com back in August.

Movie rights to the trilogy were bought up by Universal and Focus Features, U.S. media reported in March.
