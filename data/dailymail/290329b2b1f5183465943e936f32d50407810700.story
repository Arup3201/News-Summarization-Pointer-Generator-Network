A community outraged over the death of a 14-year-old skateboarder who was struck by a car only 100 metres from his home on Saturday say it's the second time in just six months a child's been killed on the suburb's 'dangerous and deadly' roads.

The tragic death of Ethan Stephenson, from Russell Island in Queensland, comes only months after nine-year-old Tyson Archbold died after he was hit by a car on nearby Canaipa Road in December.

A student at Victoria Point State High, Ethan died at the scene of the crash when the driver of a four-wheel-drive ran into him on the island's main road, Centre Road, at about 5.20 pm.

Police claim the driver of the red Land Cruiser had been drinking, however no charges have been laid.

Ethan's death has sparked outrage at the local council amongst residents, who are still also mourning the death of nine-year-old Tyson Archbold, who died after being hit by a car at the side of Canaipa Road in December of last year.

Blaming the lack of a footpath and street lights on the main thoroughfare for causing the accidents, they have continued a campaign which began back in 2011.

The grandmother of Tyson, Ingrid Selier, told the MailOnline she does have concerns regarding road safety in the area, but also suggested drivers involved in these incidents should be tested for drugs, not just alcohol.

Ms Selier added that there needs to be a greater focus on road safety education.

'I believe that kids should have far more education on road safety, the law changed [so] that police can charge a youngster under 10 for not wearing safety gear, which currently police cannot do.'

'My daughter will be campaigning against the above concerns not footpaths.'

Though she also voiced her concerns about the safety of the island's main road.

'Centre Road is a health hazard. I used to ride a bicycle down that street and always feared for my life as the road is very narrow.

'If a car passes a bike it has to almost cross onto the other side and hope no car comes from that direction.

'The times when I had to go into the gutter or off road into slippery gravel were numerous and women walk down that road on the road with prams.'

Tyson Archbold was tragically killed on the same small island on a nearby road in December of last year

Russell Island is a small community located 40 kilometres south-east of Brisbane

Russell Island is a small island which is about eight kilometres long and just under three kilometres wide, located off the Queensland coast 40 kilometres south-east of Brisbane.

The mother of one of Ethan’s close friends and a resident of Russell Island, Kate Hill, has taken the lead in the protests by sharing video footage of the condition of the island’s footpaths.

'I just promised my 14 year old son he will not lose another mate on this island because council do not provide basic infrastructure nor do they care,' Mrs Hill wrote.

'All we are asking for is a footpath and lighting on the main road that I believe is approximately 8.5km long.'

The video shows an unknown person walking along a narrow path on the island's main road, which only extends up to two kilometres, according to Mrs Hill.

The short path is boarded by dense shrubs on one side and the edge of a busy road on the other. The rest of the way, residents are forced to walk along the road.

'Ethan was a beautiful boy and he died way too soon from that something that could have been avoided,' Mrs Hill said.

'He was actually seen on that footpath and then was forced onto that road again to get home because there's nowhere to walk.

Russell Island resident and the mother of one of Ethan's friends, is petitioning her local council for changes to be made

Ethan's death has sparked outrage amongst community members who blame a lack of basic pedestrian infrastructure for his death

'We have a main road with very little lighting and no footpath. It's utterly and completely ridiculous.

'What we're trying to do is get as many people to write to councilors, our MP and our mayor and say this is inadequate. This is a basic duty of care, not just to our children but a lot of our population are elderly who have mobility scooters and they’re on the road because there’s no footpaths  - in the dark.'

Another Russel Island resident, Melissa Warne, said infrastructure for the neighboring Macleay Island, would also be included in their demands.

Residents have so far bombarded their local council with letters and plan to meet with their mayor in the coming week for discussions.

Ethan's devastated high school friends have also planned to write tributes to the 14-year-old on a pole at their school.

Tyson's death at the end of 2013 also sparked outrage from the small close-knit community, and friends and family were further upset when council apparently removed his road-side memorial from the place he was struck.

The Forensic Crash Unit are still investigating both incidents, and charges are yet to be laid over either incident.
