Everyone has dreamed of living like a billionaire, but only a select few can afford the luxury.

However one luxury travel company has made the lavish lifestyle more accessible by offering a tour around the world's best hotel rooms.

Hurlingham Travel have organised a three-week holiday incorporating 10 of the globe's most expensive suites, and it could cost as little as £371. The trip takes in the world's best hotel accommodation, some of which costs as £25,000 a night.

It includes the Royal Suite of the 7-star Burj Al Arab in Dubai, which comes complete with a butler and a solid gold iPad concierge service, and the two-story Sky Villa at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas, which has a cantilever pool on the roof with a panoramic views of the strip.

The trip also takes in Europe's largest suite The Villa La Cupola in Rome’s Excelsior, which has just undergone a renovation, and  the Penthouse Suite in the George V in Paris, which has stunning terraces offering sweeping views of the city, including the Eiffel Tower.

Travellers can also play the Grand Piano while gazing at the New York skyline from the Ty Warner Penthouse situated at the top of the Four Seasons Hotel, and catch a private helicopter ride across the Bosphorus in Istanbul to the The Sultan’s Suite at the Çirağan Palace Kempinski.

The holiday, which has been put together by Hurlingham Travel, is available through to buy through luxury launch company VeryFirstTo for £359,000 up front, however AuctionWhatIDid is putting the trip under the hammer online for those with tighter purse strings, and the starting price is a measly £371.

The final cost will include business class flights to every destination and accommodation at every hotel.

Chris Woodcock, founder of the online auction site, said: 'During this relentless recession, a way to purchase products at a fraction of their price is going to be popular. Especially when that product is something reserved only for the rich and famous.'

Marcel Knobil founder of VeryFirstTo said: 'No one has ever had the unadulterated pleasure of indulging in a trip of this nature before – I’m delighted that we can make it available to those with deep and shallow pockets.'
