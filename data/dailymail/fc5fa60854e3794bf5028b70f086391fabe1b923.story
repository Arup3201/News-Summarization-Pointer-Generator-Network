Two fathers who had their young sons kidnapped and taken to Europe by their mother, who they had both been married to, are now telling the incredible story about how they got their boys back.

Larry Hummel and Bob Pfeifer launched a transatlantic hunt for their children after mother Maria Pfeifer spirited them away to Europe in 2012.

Sasha Hummel, 4, and Robert 'Jerry' Pfeifer, 10, were returned to the US in December after the men were tipped off that they were living in France, where they had been disguised as girls.

But the boys' mother claims they should still be living with her.

Relief: Two fathers, Larry Hummel and Bob Pfeifer, fought to find their sons Sasha, 4, (right) and Jerry, 10, (left)   for 18 months after their mother kidnapped them and hid them in Europe in 2012

Happier times: Larry Hummel was married to Maria Pfeifer and had a son called Sasha

Previous love: Maria was also married to Bob Pfeifer and they also had a son - Robert 'Jerry' Pfeifer

Happy father: Larry Hummel finally got his son Sasha back in the US in December 2013

Reunited: Robert Pfeifer and his son Robert 'Jerry' Pfeifer, 10, walk at LAX after arriving from France, Saturday, December 28, 2013

Now the fathers have explained how they hunted for their children until last December when the FBI told him they had found Sasha and his older brother living in France under false names.

And as the men explained to ABC News the video that shocked them showed footage of the boys with their mother at a campsite in Slovakia.

Both boys had long blond hair and the youngest boy even had pigtails, so the men think that their mother was trying to disguise their sons as girls.

Mother Maria Pfeifer had taken the children from Los Angeles to a court-approved vacation in eastern Europe but never returned.

After having no success in tracking down their children for the first year the fathers turned to a huge social media campaign all over Europe.

'We would take a photo and the message in the native language and literally post it on every Facebook page in the target area, whether it was a bar, a hair dresser, an entertainer,' Pfeifer said.

'Thousands of hours went into this,' he added.

Hopes: Maria told ABC's 20/20 that she wants her boys back

Never give up: The fathers organized a huge social media campaign to try and find their children, and Pfeifer even went to the US Embassy in Paris without an appointment to enlist the help of the FBI

Return: Maria said she is willing to face criminal charges in the US to have a chance at getting custody of her children

Pfeifer pressed two felony counts of Child Detention with Right to Custody against his former wife.

After a tip-off from one of Maria's friends that she might be with the boys in Paris, Pfeifer flew to the French capital.

The
 desperate father then walked into the the US Embassy - without an 
appointment - and showed his investigations to FBI special agent Eugene 
Casey.

Agent Casey immediately started on the case and, at the end of 2013, it all paid off.

In December, Hummel told the Los Angeles Daily News: 'I’ve lived this moment in my head for 18 months and to actually have it come true and be able to pick him up, bring him home, put him in my bed... it’s unbelievable.'

Yet Maria Pfeifer says that she wants her sons back and is planning to return to Los Angeles in the near future.

On ABC's 20/20 on Friday night the tearful mother she said that is willing to face criminal charges back in the US if it means a chance of getting some custody of the children.

But last year Hummel explained to the New York Daily News that having young Sasha back in his life is ‘magical.’

‘It's
 beyond great. I was worried because we hadn't seen each other for so 
long, but all my fears about him not recognizing me are over.

'It's the best, like he never left,’ the overjoyed father told the paper.

At last! Bob Pfeifer was overjoyed to get his son back in December 2013, after 18 months away

Happy child: Sasha pictured back in the US

‘She was basically on the run, paying for everything in wads of cash and forcing the boys to live like refugees in Slovakia, Germany, Switzerland and France,’ said Mr Hummel.

The feds tracked her down after an anonymous tip shifted their focus to France, and then to a town on the border with Switzerland.

The boys’ fugitive mother had grown out their hair and changed their names. Mr Hummel believed she was also turning tricks as a prostitute to make ends meet, something she had a history of in the past, he said.

Court records cited by the Daily News revealed Ms Pfiefer was acquitted in 2010 of escorting without a license and a second count of prostitution was dropped.

Together again: Mr Hummel and his son look as happy as ever

Both Mr Hummel and Robert Pfeifer, the father of the older boy, worked to bring the children home – and they finally had success.

‘I was really nervous about how much Sasha would remember because he was only three when he was taken, and I knew he'd be seeing me for the first time totally out of context in France,’ Mr Hummel recalled to the paper.

‘Within 10 minutes, we were playing together like old chums,’ he added.

Both men were married to the supposed prostitute for less than year, he explained. The two fathers plan to keep the children close and allow them to see each other often.

Their mother is out on bail in France and faces extradition to the US to face charges of abduction.

Despite her facing jail time, Mr Hummel expressed hopes to the paper that she would ‘face the music’ so she could eventually ‘get back in Sasha's life.’
