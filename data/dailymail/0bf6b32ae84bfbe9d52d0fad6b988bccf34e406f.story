Storms could bring travel chaos to Britain later this week, with restrictions already placed on some parts of the railway network.

The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning for gales and heavy rain, saying that gusts of up to 80mph were possible tonight and tomorrow.

First Great Western said train services between Exeter St Davids and Penzance had been suspended due to deteriorating conditions in the South West.

And Southeastern warned rail passengers in south-east England that high winds and heavy rain could lead to floods, landslips and falling trees.

A 40mph speed restriction has been put in place across part of the network from 11pm tonight until tomorrow evening.

Network Rail said speed restrictions are in place on the coastal route between Havant in Hampshire and Hastings in East Sussex.

It is likely that further restrictions will be put in place on the route between London Waterloo and the south coast, a spokesman said.

It comes as London Underground workers launched a 48-hour strike tonight in a row over ticket office closures, causing travel chaos in the capital.

Thousands of union members walked out at 9pm, and again at the same time next week, leading to disruption to Tube services until Friday morning.

Winds of up to 80mph could hit some southern and western coastal areas - and Britain can expect a series of Atlantic depressions over the week.

Meanwhile, Western Power Distibution said that 6,000 homes were without power in South-West.

On the lookout: The Environment Agency has issued 198 flood alerts, mostly in the South East, the South West and the Midlands - as well as 68 flood warnings

A Met Office spokesman said: ‘Heavy rain and gales sweeping in from the west later on Tuesday and for Wednesday brings the risk of further flooding.

'(There will be) possible disruption to transport and power supplies. Southern England is also at risk for further heavy rain on Thursday night.

'However, there is some uncertainty about whether this area of low pressure will reach our shores. It may stay to the south of us.'

The Environment Agency has issued 198 flood alerts, mostly in the South East, the South West and the Midlands - as well as 68 flood warnings.

The EA said widespread rain could cause river and surface water flooding in the South and West as well as parts of the Midlands.

Strong winds and large waves will increase the risk of coastal flooding along the South West and southern coasts tonight and into tomorrow, it added.

It said severe flood warnings, which mean there is danger to life, are likely to be issued along the Dorset coastline for the high tide tomorrow morning.

The flood misery could continue for 
people isolated on the Somerset Levels as forecasters have predicted 
more rain for the region.

Meanwhile coastguards have warned people to be particularly careful in coastal areas.

‘Rough
 seas and extreme weather might look exciting, but getting too close can
 be risky,’ said the RNLI's coastal safety staff officer Will Stephens.

‘So respect the water and, in particular, avoid exposed places where big waves could sweep you off your feet.’

Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales has said the ‘tragedy’ on the flood-hit Somerset Levels is that ‘nothing happened for so long’.

Charles
 made the remarks as he met local farmers, flood victims and emergency 
services personnel who have been affected by the on-going disaster.

He pledged a £50,000 donation to support flood victims, with the Duke of Westminster matching the funding with an additional £50,000.

Charles's comments came amid growing anger over a perceived lack of Government action to help flood-hit areas on the Levels.

Residents have begged the EA to start dredging, with many complaining they are living in ‘third world’ conditions with ‘overflowing’ septic tanks.

‘There's nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something,’ the prince said. ‘The tragedy is that nothing happened for so long.’

The Somerset Levels suffered ‘once in 100 years’ flooding in July 2012, but has endured even worse conditions from December 2013.

More than 128,000 acres have been deluged - at a huge cost to local farmers - with around 40 homes under water and 200 more cut off.
