There have been countless iPhone 6 concepts that show how designers would like the handset to look, but not necessarily how it will look.

A Dutch industrial product design student has addressed this balance by creating a series of mockups based on leaked specifications, images of dummy models and current handsets.

All the elements were modelled from scratch, and any dimensions that haven’t been leaked have been based on the iPhone 5S.

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up
 until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest 
phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 
millimetres).

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). 

By
 comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 
millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches 
(7.5 millimetres).

Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M9 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres). 

The concepts are the work of Dutch project design student Mark Pelin, and show a sleek, thin and rounded design.

The home button is shown with a metal ring, expected to be Apple's next-generation fingerprint scanner, and the rear of the case features black stripes along the top and the bottom.

Pelin told MailOnline: ‘The antenna stripes are 1mm wide - significantly thinner than on the dummy models - and have a ‘black glass’ idea to them, similar to what the 5S has on the back.

‘I modelled every part, from scratch, [including the] headphone jack, cameras, lightning port, and all the buttons.

‘As far as I can tell, the dimensions are correct down to the millimetre.

'I used the dimensions of the ‘leaked’ iPhone 6 schematics, and the dummy dimensions.’

The design (pictured) resembles the rounded edges of Apple's 3GS. Any dimensions in Pelin's mockups that haven't been leaked were based on the current iPhone 5S

Rumours suggest the iPhone 6 will be 6mm (0.2 inches) thick, which is smaller than the iPhone 5s' 7.6mm (0.3 inches) design. This has led to rumours the handset will be known as the iPhone Air. The antenna stripes on Pelin's mockups (pictured) are 1mm wide - thinner than what's appeared on the leaked dummy models

Any dimensions that haven’t been leaked or hinted at were designed as they appear on the 5S.

This includes the lightning port, headphone jack and volume rocker, which Pelin thinks are unlikely to change.

'There are some parts where I had to take a good guess of course,' continued Pelin.

‘It's hard to model the iPhone 6 without exact dimensions for everything.

'Overall, it's extremely close to the dummy model and probably the real thing.’

Rumours suggest Apple is working on two versions of different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One.

A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5.

A recent selection of leaked images revealed changes to button placements.

The power button, usually found on the top of iPhones for example, appeared to be located on the side of the device.

The volume and lock buttons, however, will seemingly remain where they are.

Latest images of Apple's supposed iPhone 6 were leaked last month (shown), showing a phone with an ultra-thin design and rounded images. The power button, typically found on the top of previous iPhones, appears to have been moved to the side, making the device easier to operate with one hand

The rumoured back of Apple’s new iPhone 6 (pictured left) looks similar to that of the HTC One (pictured right) with a horizontal line at the top and bottom and curved edges. It also suggests Apple may have found a way to make its 'True Tone' flash technology smaller as the whole is different to an iPhone 5S

It is believed the iPhone 6, which some think will go by the name of the iPhone Air, will sport a 1704 x 960 resolution display, and an A8 processor.

The iPhone 5S, by comparison, has a 1136 x 640 resolution, and the A7 chip.

These hardware changes will be in addition to the features of Apple's latest iOS 8 software, unveiled last month, which include health monitors and smart notifications.
