Maintenance works at the hotel where Jeremy Clarkson allegedly punched a producer in a row over a steak dinner had to be delayed the morning after - so he could have a cooked breakfast.

BBC staff reportedly pleaded with the Simonstone Hall Hotel in the Yorkshire Dales not to disconnect the hotel's electricity supply for planned works after Clarkson overslept following the incident.

Clarkson was suspended after allegedly punching producer Oisin Tymon during a row after filming over a hot meal at the hotel.

Maintenance works at the hotel where Jeremy Clarkson (pictured today) allegedly punched a producer in a row over a steak dinner had to be delayed the morning after - so he could have a cooked breakfast

The following morning the Top Gear presenter slept in while most of the BBC crew checked out and left, a hotel staff member said. 

The worker, who spoke to Sky News anonymously, said Clarkson was lucky he had not been served cold cereal instead.

They said: 'I got a call to say Clarkson was still in his room and wouldn't be down 'til 10 o'clock,' a member of the kitchen staff told Sky News.

'I said, "Well in that case he'll have to have Weetabix" because a sign on reception said the electricity would be cut off at half past nine.' 

The top-rating show was pulled off air while an inquiry was launched into the alleged 'fracas'.

The BBC's report into the events will be handed over to the director-general next week, a corporation spokesman said.

Senior BBC executive Ken MacQuarrie has been tasked with sorting out what happened during the incident, but a date for the conclusion of the inquiry is not yet known.

The BBC has postponed the remaining episodes of Top Gear following the incident  - a move which has seen it lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints.

Sunday night's planned episode was replaced by a Red Arrows documentary which pulled in just one million viewers - compared to the five million who regularly tune in for the popular motoring show.

Meanwhile, a petition to Bring Back Clarkson has attracted more than 960,000 supporters.

Another petition calling on the BBC to hire Alan Partridge, the fictional broadcaster played by Steve Coogan, as the new presenter of Top Gear has also been launched, with almost 20,000 signatures. 

The presenter is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live Top Gear shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and a decision on whether to go ahead is expected soon. 

All three men's contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs, which could render any disciplinary hearings redundant.

Clarkson is also expected to record an episode of the BBC's top-rating satire show Have I Got News For You in May.
