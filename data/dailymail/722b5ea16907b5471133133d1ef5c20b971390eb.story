An Oregon hotel is suing a TripAdvisor user who alleged in a review that its housekeeping staff ‘were high or drunk’ and that the owner ‘smokes weed’.

The reviewer, who went by the username 12Kelly, also wrote that ‘breakfast is nasty, the rooms are nasty’ and ‘Jen front desk had phone sex with someone’, the defamation suit said.

It is being brought by The Ashley Inn, in Lincoln City – owned by Lincoln City Lodging Limited Partnership - which claims that the review was malicious.

‘Defendant made the statements deliberately, maliciously, and willfully with the specific intent to cause damage to the character and reputation of Lincoln City Lodging and the Inn,’ the suit reads, according to Oregon Live.

The review has since been taken down, but the suit states that it was accessible ‘to any person who visited TripAdvisor form a computer device in Oregon’.

At the time of writing 287 reviews had been posted on TripAdvisor for the Ashley Inn, with 158 ranking the hotel as 'excellent', 74 'very good', 15 'average', 18 'poor' and 22 'terrible'.

The hotel has an average customer score of four out of five.

One described the hotel as 'a haven for the weary' and another 'a diamond on the Oregon coast'.

The person responsible for the review that’s the subject of the lawsuit has yet to be identified.

The suit was filed to Multnomah County Circuit Court by Portland attorney Jeffrey Frasier.

The news follows a warning by hospitality chiefs in Britain that hotels and restaurants are being targeted by 'blackmailers' who demand free meals and stays in exchange for not writing bad reviews on TripAdvisor.

The fraudsters are telling staff they will post bad comments on the review site if they don't get better service, free food or upgrades.

Restaurant, hotel and B&B owners across the UK have reported a huge rise in the number of customers who use TripAdvisor as a threat.
