An NFL star has been caught on tape using the N-word at a Kenny Chesney concert.

Pointing his finger aggressively at the crowd of the June 9 show, Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper appears to say on the cell phone video: 'I will jump that fence and fight every n***** here.'

The offensive remark came just minutes after Cooper was caught having a disagreement with another concert goer in the parking lot at the Lincoln Financial Field event, though the argument was broken up swiftly.

Slur: Pointing his finger aggressively at the crowd and the camera, Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper, pictured, launches into a racist tirade

The 25-year-old was quick to apologize for his behavior on Wednesday afternoon, after the video showing the racial slur went viral online.

He took to Twitter to condemn the slur.

'I am so ashamed and disgusted with myself,' he said in an apology spread over several tweets. 'I want to apologize. I have been offensive. I have apologized to my coach, Jeffrey Lurie, and Howie Roseman and to my teammates.

'I owe an apology to the fans and to 
this community. I am so ashamed, but there are no excuses. What I did 
was wrong and I will accept the consequences.'

Cooper has been fined an undisclosed amount by the team and now awaits word on whether the NFL will offer up more discipline.

On
 top of his earlier tweets, the receiver spent nearly seven minutes 
apologizing and answering questions at a press conference on Wednesday 
evening outside the club.

He said he intended to apologize later to his teammates, many of whom are African American.

'It's
 going to be very difficult for me. I'm going to tell them, "I'm 
extremely sorry," tell them exactly what I'm telling you guys. There was
 a confrontation and I handled it extremely, extremely poorly,' Cooper 
said.

'This is kind of the lowest of lows. This isn't the type of person I want to be portrayed as. This isn't the type of person that I am.

'I know no one in Philadelphia is happy with me right now. I accept that. I just hope they see the true me. And accept my apology.'

NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined to say if the league would take further discipline.

'The NFL stands for diversity and inclusion. Comments like this are wrong, offensive, and unacceptable,' Aiello said.

The tape, obtained by Philadelphia sporting blog Crossing Broad, shows Cooper, dressed in a sleeveless red and black plaid shirt and with his blonde hair in a ponytail, push a man's hand off his shoulder before launching into the tirade.

It's not clear what his companion said immediately prior to the remark.

No excuses: 'I owe an apology to the fans and to this community. I am so ashamed, but there are no excuses. What I did was wrong and I will accept the consequences,' he tweeted

He then brushes his hand away again and turns around, at which point a bottle of beer is clearly visible in the footballer's hand.

Afterwards, the country star pulled Cooper, teammate Jason Kelce and coach Chip Kelly on stage to perform 'Boys of Fall.'

Cooper was a fifth-round pick in the 2010 NFL Draft. He had 23 catches for 248 receiving yards last season for the Eagles.

He is expected to compete for a starting wide receiver job to replace the injured Jeremy Maclin.
