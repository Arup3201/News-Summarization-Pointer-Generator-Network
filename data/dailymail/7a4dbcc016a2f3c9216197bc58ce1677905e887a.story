Barely 20 years after it brought digital viewing into the nation’s living rooms, it seems the DVD is on its way out.

Machines that play and record the discs are being overtaken by ‘on demand’ streaming services such as Netflix – suggesting DVDs themselves will soon follow video tapes and vinyl records into the dustbin of history.

The latest victim of technological advance has been signalled by the release of the annual ‘shopping basket’ by the Office for National Statistics – a list of 700 items that reflects household spending habits and is used by the Government to identify the official inflation rate.

Known as the consumer price inflation index, the rate is calculated using 180,000 price quotations from 150 areas across the UK, and sets the benchmark for increases in pensions, benefits and often pay.

DVD recorders have been dropped from the basket completely and rental subscriptions have also been replaced.

Hardwood floors join the list of casualties as families turn away from minimalist design in favour of carpets, while the continued squeeze on the cost of living has also caused the removal of fees for gardeners and children’s after-school clubs. 

However, their replacements reveal the impact of celebrity culture on the public’s buying patterns.

Fresh fruit snacking pots have been included to reflect the increasing shelf-space in supermarkets devoted to prepared fresh fruit. Honey is on the list for the first time, perhaps a result of renewed interest in baking

Service providers are also taking on traditional broadcasters by making their own exclusive content. Netflix, for example, has had a hit with its series House Of Cards, the US political drama starring Kevin Spacey

Canvas training shoes, like those 
favoured by Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas, and statement 
necklaces like the one worn by Charlize Theron to the Oscars have made 
it into the basket for the first time, while the influence of smartly 
dressed male stars such as Gary Barlow can be seen in the addition of 
men’s rented suits.

Hire firm Moss Bros has reported strong growth in recent years, pointing to rising popularity of school proms for suit hire and men smartening up for their weekend wardrobes.

Meanwhile, busy lifestyles are reflected in the fact that snack pots of prepared fruit, sold by supermarkets and sandwich shop chains, have been added.

The flexibility of online on demand viewing means that a monthly subscription allows their output to be viewed on laptops, tablets and smartphones, rather than being restricted to the family TV.

Broadcasters shouldn’t worry just yet though, as  other additions to the basket include bird seed, suggesting programmes like BBC’s Springwatch have fired our interest in wildlife.

Honey, which is perceived as a healthy alternative to sugar and jams, also makes an appearance.

It has been helped by recommendations from chefs like Lorraine Pascale and a return to cooking from scratch as seen on The Great British Bake Off.

However wallpaper paste has been omitted, as DIY and the chore of putting up wallpaper is rejected by many young families in favour of emulsion paint.
