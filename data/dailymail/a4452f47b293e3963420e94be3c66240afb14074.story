Physics genius Professor Stephen Hawking has told Roy Hodgson that his best chances of winning the World Cup in Brazil rest on key factors like playing a 4-3-3 formation, wearing red shirts and persuading the blondest players to take the penalties.

After a month long study into the science of England’s past World Cup performances, Professor Hawking shared some of his findings.

Perhaps most worrying among them for a team set to start their campaign in the Amazon rainforest, he found that a five-degree increase in temperature reduces England’s chances of winning by 59 per cent.

Winning formula: Professor Stephen Hawking has unveiled maths that would win England the World Cup

Success: Hawking's formulae for England winning the World Cup (top) and for penalties victory

Numbers game: The Cambridge physicist analysed data from every tournament since 1966 - but he believes the heat, the altitude and the distance from home could all scupper England's chances

He also discovered England are 22 per cent more likely to win short-haul games and that jet-lag, cultural differences and the nationality of the referee and shirt colour all take their toll. They are better close to sea-level and kicking off as near to 3pm as possible.

In red, England have a 20 per cent higher rate of success, fitting the theory that red makes teams feel 'more confident, more aggressive and more dominant', something which will not be lost on Cardiff owner Vincent Tan.

Professor Hawking also found England won 63 per cent of games with a European referee, compared with 38 per cent when the referee is from elsewhere. He also added that: 'WAGs are irrelevant.'

As for penalties, he discovered strikers score the most, not surprisingly. The best place to aim is for the top corners and he also found blond and bald players perform better from the spot than those which dark hard, something he claimed with remain 'one of the mysteries of science.'

Putting them on the spot: England are rubbish at penalties. Fact.

Blonds are better: Apparently blonds (such as Joe Hart) are proven to be more proficient at penalties

Irrelevant: WAGs like Steven Gerrard's wife Alex Curran don't affect chances of winning, according to Hawking

Colour of success: England are more likely to win if they wear red, as they did famously in 1966

'European referees are more sympathetic to the English game and less sympathetic to ballerinas like [Luis] Suarez,' he said, and noted that goalkeepers who wobble around like Bruce Grobelaar or jump from side to side are 18 per cent more likely to make a save.

'As a theoretical physicist I am marginally more qualified to make predictions than Paul the Octopus,” said Professor Hawking, who was commissioned for the study by bookmakers Paddy Power and has donated his fee to charities.

He’s going for Brazil to win it, by the way. A selection based on the fact that more than 30 per cent of World Cups have been won by the host nation.

But he added: 'All science, mathematics and rational thought goes out of the window. I am an Englishman and I will be cheering our boys all the way to the final in Rio.'

Line up: Professor Hawking said that England should play 4-3-3 rather than 4-4-2, based on its success

Dancer: Luis Suarez gets less sympathy from referees as he is a 'ballerina', according to Hawking

Wobblers: And jelly-legged keepers, like Jerzy Dudek, are more likely to make a save

'This will remain one of science's great mysteries': Professor Hawking said there is no evidence that it's advantageous to be left or right-footed but bald players and fair-haired players are more likely to score

Goalkeeper mobility: Players should place the ball in the top left or right hand corner when taking a penalty
