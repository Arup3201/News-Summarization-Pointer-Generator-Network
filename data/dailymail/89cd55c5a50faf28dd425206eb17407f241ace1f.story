Serial reality TV star Jamie Otis married a complete stranger on television just moments after branding the wedding 'the worst decision of my entire life' as she didn't find her new husband in anyway attractive. 

The 27-year-old agreed to  marry software salesman Doug Hehner, 31, on the first episode of FYI's new extreme reality show Married at First Sight.

In the show, the contestants agree to marry a complete stranger and live with them for four weeks before deciding whether to continue with the arrangement or seek a divorce.

The nerves soon turned to complete disappointment when she saw her intended husband, Doug Hehner, pictured, describing her first sight of him as 'the worst feeling... I just happen not to be attracted to the guy'

Otis left viewers of the controversial show wondering whether she was going to marry the man selected for her.  

During the voice over, Otis said: 'This is the worst feeling. Obviously I wasn't like, "what a knockout!"

'I couldn't help but look at his family, because they were like, beaming, huge smiles, looking at me, and I just happen not to be attracted to the guy.' 

The reality TV veteran provided the show's producers with the cliffhanger they wanted. She said: 'I'm getting married right now to someone I don't know. I'm thinking I just made the worst decision of my life. I am so scared.'

Otis had previously appeared on The Bachelor and spin-off series The Bachelor Pad. 

But, despite the cliffhanger, Otis soon took to Twitter to announce the fact that she was now married 

Doug Hehner appeared during the show to have been far happier with the experts' choice of partner 

Reality TV veteran Jamie Otis told her twitter followers that she can't say whether she's still married to Hehner

According to US Magazine, her intended husband soon picked up on the nurse's reluctance.

Hehner told viewers: 'She was freaking out. And it seems like she doesn't know what's going on .It was a tense moment.'

The six contestants were 'matched' by a group of four experts including a sexologist, a spiritualist, a psychologist and a sociologist. 

The experts sifted though hundreds of applicants before deciding upon the final six people. 

Otis had previously sought TV love on the reality show The Bachelor. 

Sexologist Dr Logan Levkoff told Jezebel that each of the matches was a real marriage. 

She said: 'This experiment seeks to determine whether social science can play a role in marital success.

'If we can offer a new way to find a connection (and a long-lasting one), imagine the possibilities!'

Otis, pictured, said it was difficult finding true love in New York City, so signed up for her third reality TV show

Otis told the New York Post: 'In New York City, I feel like the guys are primarily just players until they’re hitting their late 30s. It’s tough to find guys who are serious.'

The show is based on a format first used in Denmark. 

In an interview with The Knot, Otis revealed: 'The truth is, I never envisioned a traditional wedding for myself. 

'Nothing about my life is traditional, so why worry about having a traditional wedding?

'It was a genuinely intimate, personal, and real experience. It's been a life-changing journey."
