Tragedy: Talented student Blake Ayling, 20, died while walking across a rail yard after a college party

The parents of a student who died while crossing a railway line after a college party are suing his fraternity, claiming they should not have served their son alcohol.

Blake Ayling was killed while walking through Grand Forks Rail Yard, North Dakota, when he became tangled in a moving train.

An autopsy revealed the 20-year-old, who was on the University of North Dakota's Roll of Honor, was drunk when he bled to death after tearing his arm.

According to the Grand Forks Herald, his parents, Corey and Robin, are arguing the chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha contributed to their son's death in March 2012.

The
 pair are also suing BNSF Railways, suggesting the company knew students
 used the yard as a shortcut, but failed to put up adequate warning 
signs.

According to 
his room mate, the talented business student would routinely use the 
rail yard as a short cut to his student apartment.

On the night of the horrifying incident, he had attended a jersey party which required partygoers to wear sports shirts.

The
 complaint says IDs were not properly checked and some students signed 
the party’s guestbook under fake names such as 'Bob Saget' and 'Hannah Montana'.

Mr Ayling is thought to have left the
 party around 1 a.m. His jersey and backpack were found in the 
fraternity’s basement and were turned over to police a few days later.

His
 parents also suggested the railway company knew people used the yard as
 a quicker route home to the college campus, but failed to use gates or 
fences to deter people from crossing.

Scene: The talented student walked across the Grand Forks rail yard as a shortcut to his campus flat

Fraternity: The talented student had attended a party at Pi Kappa Alpha on the University's campus. His parents are now suing the organisation, claiming alcohol served at the party led to his death

They added in the lawsuit there were no warning signs near the dangerous area and no preventative measures such as fences were bordering the yard.

'While entirely foreseeable, BNSF failed to acknowledge, consider, appreciate or act on the fact that its rail yard is in effect a silent lethal killing field in the middle of a concentrated population,' the complaint reads.

He was a sophomore from Minneapolis 
working toward a major in entrepreneurship, according to the university.
 He was on the President’s Roll of Honor and the Dean’s List.

At the time of his death, police determined it was an accident.
