The rise of social networking sites is putting children at greater risk of bullying and body image worries than ever before, a leading headmaster has warned.

Constant scrutiny on websites such as AskFM, Little Gossip, Facebook and Instagram leaves many teenagers  feeling like ‘the hopelessly inadequate stars of their own second-rate biopics’, Andrew Halls said.

He said no previous generation had endured so much attention from peers who ‘adore, revile or all too publicly ignore on a moment-by-moment basis’.

Headmaster Andrew Halls says the rise of social networking sites is putting children at greater risk of bullying and body image

Mr Halls, the head of King’s College 
School, Wimbledon, an £18,900-a-year boys’ day school, urged schools to 
instil ‘grit’ and emotional resilience in pupils to help them cope with 
the pressures of modern life.

Tomorrow,
 200 independent school heads and teachers will attend a ‘True Grit’ 
conference at his school on how to introduce resilience training for 
pupils.

Mr Halls said 
anonymous chat sites such as AskFM and Little Gossip left children 
‘vulnerable to cruel and absurd slanders that, for some, can be 
literally life-ending’.

Teenagers
 now live the ‘tortured drama of their adolescence under the scrutiny of
 hundreds or even thousands of others’, he added, which often leaves 
them feeling ‘small and vulnerable’.

‘Social
 networking sites require every 21st-century teenager to live his or her
 life under the eye of an electronic adjudicator far more cruel and 
censorious than any examiner, school teacher, or parent,’ he said.

The rise of social networking sites has meant that young people are now living their lives 'under the eye of an electronic adjudicator', Andrew Halls warned

‘No
 previous generation has spent so long online, “liking” and being 
“liked”, or devastatingly ignored,  in the OCD world of never-ending 
updates, status change, Instagram, AskFM, Little Gossip and Facebook. No
 wonder that every teenager can feel like the hopelessly inadequate star
 of his own second-rate biopic.’

Girls and boys of all backgrounds are affected due to the ‘democracy of the internet’, argued Mr Halls.

And
 he said some independent schools had been ‘woefully reluctant’ to 
discuss mental health issues, estimated to affect one in ten young 
people.

He added: ‘Girls 
from aspirational families are the fastest-growing group using mental 
health services, as they strive to achieve more and more impossibly 
brilliant results.

‘We know that boys and young men are much more affected by body image pressures than was the case twenty years ago.

‘And
 now we know this can afflict the public school 1st XV hero addicted to 
fitness routines and diet supplements just as much  as the forgotten boy
 in the corner of a comprehensive school locker-room cutting runes of 
self-loathing into his arm.’

Mr Halls added that young  people are increasingly ‘tormented’ by a ‘cult of self-consciousness’.

‘They
 know that the world is competitive, and they are surrounded by images 
not just of the impossibly beautiful, but of the incredibly wealthy, or 
the incredibly bright. How can they compete?’ he said.

‘Then
 they see in their school a thousand posters admonishing human beings 
for their part in  global warming, famine, pollution, over-population 
and war.

‘We mean well when
 we lecture our pupils in this way, but to what degree do we present 
them with a challenge that seems so impossible the only response is to 
crouch with arms crossed before their eyes?’

Mr Halls said that the problems faced by 21st-century teenagers ‘cut through class and gender stereotypes’.

‘Almost
 every bright sixth-former from an affluent family will know of someone 
who is suffering from a body image-related problem.

'But we also know 
that the UK invariably tops Europe’s league table for teenage suicides, 
and these are frequently of less well-educated or less affluent 
children.’

'A recent 
Government study found that almost a quarter of children live with 
parents who are in an unhappy relationship, with a higher proportion 
among poor families, he said.

'These children are more at risk of mental 
health problems or drug and alcohol abuse.

‘These
 issues affect everyone, children and parents, in 21st-century Britain –
 not just dysfunctional homes, and not just affluent ones,’ Mr Halls 
said.

He added that ‘true 
grit and resilience training’ was intended to show children they could 
‘change things both within them and around them for the better’.

He said the conference aimed to help teenagers ‘rise above despair, focus on their own strengths and win the battle of life’.
