HITLER'S FIRST VICTIMS AND ONE MAN'S RACE FOR JUSTICE

by Timothy W. Ryback

(Bodley Head £16.99)

One sunny April morning in 1933, while most people were getting ready for the Easter weekend, two men drove through the Bavarian countryside, towards the pretty little town of Dachau.

One was Josef Hartinger, a 39-year-old veteran of World War I, a serious, conservative, religious man, who worked as a deputy prosecutor in Munich. The other was Moritz Flamm, the district’s forensic examiner, another war veteran and a similarly quiet, serious man.

They were on their way to investigate the deaths of four men, who had been found shot on the dreary moorland outside Dachau. It might sound like the premise for a Sunday-night crime drama but, as Ryback shows in this frighteningly compelling book, the murders marked the beginning of the darkest chapter in human history.

On the morning that Hartinger and Flamm set off from Munich, the Nazis had been in power for barely two-and-a-half months.

Yet since Adolf Hitler’s appointment as Germany’s Chancellor on January 30, he had wasted barely a minute. Almost immediately, the Nazis began taking over every institution they could lay their hands on, from the police and the judiciary to universities and football clubs.

After an arson attack on the Reichstag in February, Hitler forced through emergency legislation scrapping civil liberties and, a month later, he secured an Enabling Act allowing him to rule by decree. Already, Germany was becoming a dictatorship — in Ryback’s words, the Nazis ‘were no longer intruders in the system; they were becoming the system’.

As the men drove through the April sunshine, few could have imagined the depths to which the new regime would sink.

Hartinger himself was no bleeding-hearted liberal: in the aftermath of World War I, he had briefly served in the Right-wing Freikorps, fighting revolutionaries in the streets of Munich.

But when he got to the scene of the shootings, just outside Dachau’s new concentration camp for political prisoners (supposedly in ‘protective custody’), he knew at once that something was terribly wrong.

The four bodies belonged to camp inmates, who had supposedly been shot from a distance while trying to escape. They had been unceremoniously dumped in a shed, ‘like slain game’, instead of being treated with the respect due to the dead. Further, when Dr Flamm knelt to examine the bodies, he could see at once that they had actually been shot from close range.

There was, Hartinger wrote many years later, an atmosphere of intolerable dread in the camp, a former munitions factory. On his way out, he recalled: ‘A terrified young man pressed through the crowd. He was sobbing and told me that he was afraid he was going to be murdered.’ Hartinger tried to calm him down. No one was going to be killed, he said.

Then, he and Flamm drove back to Munich. On the way, the prosecutor told his colleague he had been shocked by the attitude of the camp commandant, a boorish SS man.

He had also noticed something that worried him. All of the four men were Jews.

Today, when the Nazis’ crimes have become part of the world’s moral inheritance, it takes a bit of effort to reconstruct the atmosphere of early 1933, when many still hoped that — given time — Hitler’s regime would evolve towards moderate respectability.

Hartinger and Flamm were very far from being natural rebels. Yet, in the next few weeks, as more reports of mysterious deaths and ‘suicides’ crossed the prosecutor’s desk, he began to realise he was dealing with something genuinely monstrous.

These were not accidents or aberrations: they were the inevitable result of a regime that had elevated violent brutality into a governing ideology.

To take one horrifying example from the end of May 1933: Hartinger was notified about the death of a Munich salesman, Sebastian Nefzger, who had apparently killed himself in his cell.

However, when Dr Flamm conducted his own forensic examination, he reported to Hartinger that he had found poor Nefzger lying in a pool of his blood. Far from having killed himself, Nefzger had almost certainly been whipped and strangled by the SS, who’d then slashed his wrists with a bread knife to make it look like suicide. For Hartinger, there could scarcely have been a better example of the Nazis’ bestiality.

The great strength of Ryback’s book is that, although the story of the Third Reich is now almost mind-numbingly familiar, his single-minded focus on Hartinger’s investigation of Dachau gives it the feel and pace of a courtroom thriller.

As it approaches its climax, you almost believe this dogged, decent man is going to win through and bring the camp commanders to justice.

But though Hartinger managed to get the authorities to dismiss the commandant and impose a new, more media-friendly regime at the camp, the momentum towards bloodshed was unstoppable.

History, unfortunately, is not a John Grisham novel. One brave man, acting almost alone, could do little against the apparatus of the Nazi state.

It is true that there was no direct link between the killings at Dachau, which probably resulted from casual cruelty and bullying rather than a deliberate policy of extermination, and the industrialised horrors of the Holocaust.

Even so this superbly researched and tautly written little book is a chilling reminder that, from small crimes, far bigger ones can grow.

It is also a moving tribute to the courage of a decent man who, motivated by his basic faith in law and order, tried to stand up and say ‘No’.

Happily, Hartinger survived the Third Reich and died in 1984 at the splendid age of 91. His friend and colleague Dr Flamm was not so lucky. Having been transferred to another post, he died in 1934 in mysterious circumstances. Hartinger heard rumours that the SS had somehow been involved.

‘By then,’ writes Ryback, ‘there was no one left with the courage or determination to investigate.’
