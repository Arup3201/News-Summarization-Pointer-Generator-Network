Duped 007 fans: Adam Adamou duped businessmen out of £1.4m by promising luxury cars, jewellery and first edition Ian Fleming books

Wealthy James Bond fans were duped out of £1.4m by a conman who promised them limited edition luxury cars, expensive jewellery and first edition Ian Fleming books.

Adam Adamou, 39, claimed he could secure luxury cars such as Ferraris, Rolls-Royce Phantoms and Aston Martins, a first edition set of James Bond novels, expensive Rolex watches and a Hawker Beechcraft plane for three businessmen.

But after initially providing an Audi R8 and an Aston Martin, Adamou pocketed the rest of the money, leaving the men £850,000 out of pocket.

He was caught after a three-year investigation uncovered his fraud.

Today, Adamou, from Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, was jailed for three years and four months after he pleaded guilty to 25 charges of fraud.

The con began when the victims, James O’Toole, 34, his brother Martin, 36, and their colleague David Breeze, 47, were approached to join a private concierge club which claimed to assist entrepreneurs invest and make profit by buying and selling luxury goods.

The men ran a York-based investment and tax advisory company called Aston Court Chambers International Ltd, named after Bond’s favourite car. They also had an off-shore branch named Universal Exports, the pseudonym used for the British Secret Service MI6 in the James Bond stories.

They had meetings with Adamou, who was in charge of sourcing at the club.

Over time he built up trust with the victims, who placed significant investments with him, ordering expensive cars and watches.

They also paid in advance to be on a waiting list for prestige cars which they hoped to sell on for a profit when their place neared the top of the list.

Adamou then told them he was setting up his own business and that their payments should be made directly to his account rather than his employer’s.

The victims received some goods initially but as time went on, Adamou failed to deliver.

Among
the payments was £12,100 for a first edition set of James Bond novels, 
which never materialised, while £40,000 was handed over for a 
Lamborghini which was only a concept car that had not even gone into 
production.

Taken for a ride: Adamou pocketed the money victims had given him in return for prestige cars such as Aston Martins, like the one driven by Pierce Brosnan in Die Another Day

He also convinced the businessmen to hand over nearly £250,000 to restore three E-Type Jaguars.

A
fourth businessman is said to have lost £75,000 to Adamou in an alleged
business investment in Wood Green, London, and £46,200 in a car deal.

At
Southwark Crown Court Adamou, who has since gone bankrupt, was told he 
had benefited to the tune of £918,015 and was ordered to repay the 
amount in future earnings.

A further nine counts of fraud and one of money-laundering were ordered to remain on file.

Judge
Deborah Taylor said: ‘These were high value, premeditated offences of 
fraud and dishonesty including a large number of victims.

‘It’s clear that these matters not only 
affected the victims personally financially but also had an impact on 
their health and business interests.'

After the case, Det Sgt Garry Ridler of 
North Yorkshire Police said: ‘This man secured the trust of his victims 
before playing on their desire to lead an extremely glamorous and 
affluent lifestyle.

‘He took the opportunity to exploit extremely wealthy individuals.

‘The
sentence reflects the level of deceit committed by Adamou. He gained 
the trust of a number of people and then abused that trust, taking them 
for as much money as he could.

‘The
case sends a clear message to all fraudsters that their lies and 
duplicity will be uncovered and they will be made to face the 
consequences of their actions.’
