THIS, Manchester City really should concede, is why you avoid long-haul travel on the eve of a game. Why matters here in England need to remain the priority ahead of commitments to their super-rich owners in Abu Dhabi. Why a catwalk encounter with Hamburg was probably not what Manuel Pellegrini and his players needed after that bruising defeat by Arsenal the previous weekend. 

Pellegrini would not admit it, of course. Blaming his employers for this, City’s second FA Cup defeat by Championship opposition in as many years, would amount to printing off his own P45. Particularly when the airline are the club sponsors.

But City performed like a team that had sat on a plane for seven hours, arriving late on Friday night after five days in a different time zone. And Middlesbrough were only too happy to take advantage.

Had Aitor Karanka’s side looked tired, they too would have had an excuse. This was their third match in a week after all. But players pushing hard for promotion seemed eager to demonstrate that they will be ready should they find themselves back in the Premier League next season. With second-half goals from Patrick Bamford and Kike, a place in the fifth round of this competition was no less than they deserved.

City might well point to the period of dominance they enjoyed in the opening 45 minutes and a series of outstanding saves from Tomas Mejias did deny them a goal.

But it was a very different City side that stumbled through the second half, with fatigue as serious an issue as a lack of composure, after Bamford superseded his previous appearance at The Etihad — as a paying spectator at a Bon Jovi concert. In the case of that opening goal, there might also have been a hint of cowardice, with the error-prone Willy Caballero seemingly reluctant to commit to a 50:50 challenge with Albert Adomah.

For a watching Pellegrini, it certainly amounted to the stuff of nightmares. First came the undercooked backpass from Fernando, then the sight of Caballero allowing Adomah to knock the ball beyond him, before the two of them ended up in a heap and then, finally, the sight of a sluggish Fernando trying to make a clearance that Bamford was bright enough to anticipate, intercept and direct the ball over the line.

As Pellegrini admitted, ‘disorder’ spread through City’s ranks and Boro were only too happy to exploit their weaknesses. Defensively Boro were outstanding here but there were some fine attacking displays too. Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, was among the best but Lee Tomlin was terrific, almost scoring too when he followed a marvellous turn with a shot that bounced off a post and across the face of goal.

For City’s stunned supporters, the only consolation was the fact that they were charged so little to witness this. Just £15 for adults and a fiver for kids. But if Pellegrini insisted his side were taking this competition as seriously as the others after being eliminated here by Wigan last term — he said as much in his programme notes — the evidence suggested otherwise.

The warning signs were there in the opening minute when Vincent Kompany made a mistake that Boro went close to capitalising on. But in fairness to City, they did then show enough composure to play some decent football that, had it not been for Mejias, would have been rewarded with a goal.

The shots on target were frequent but so too were some excellent saves from the Spaniard. He might have played for Real Madrid only once in seven years, but he excelled in the way he denied James Milner, David Silva and Stevan Jovetic.

Other opportunities were squandered by City. Sergio Aguero invited Silva to score but the shot was way off target, while Dedryck Boyata took two swipes at a Milner cross only to send his second effort yards over the crossbar. In total, City had 13 shots in the first half; a measure, if you like, of their frustration.

Bamford’s goal made that miss all the more frustrating for City, but all the more concerning for their manager was the fact that soon afterwards they almost gave away a second.

Again Caballero was at fault, passing straight to Tomlin who then skipped past one challenge before unleashing a shot that the Argentine goalkeeper – to his credit – saved before three City bodies threw themselves in the path of the follow-up effort from Grant Leadbitter.

Pellegrini responded by sending on Frank Lampard from the bench, and the former Chelsea midfielder almost equalised when a deflected effort bounced off a post.

But Boro had other chances before Kike’s breakaway strike, with Tomlin seeing a shot bounce off a post and Adomah almost lob Caballero.

For Karanka, a one-time Real Madrid player meeting a former Madrid manager for the first time, it must have been particularly pleasurable. For Pellegrini, however, there was plenty to regret. Long-haul travel being one of them.

With the start of the second half came yet another marvellous stop by Mejias, this time to parry a goal-bound header from Jovetic.
