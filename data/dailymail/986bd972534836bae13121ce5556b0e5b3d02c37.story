A sound-proofed cinema, a botanical garden, a grotto-style swimming pool … not to mention a garage for ten cars screened by a waterfall.

It’s a mansion fit for a James Bond villain. Or, in this case, a 24-year-old painter and decorator and his wife who scooped £45million on the lottery.

Newlyweds Matt and Cassey Topham have lodged plans for their dream house, a £5million eco-home called Serenity.

Bolthole: Matt and Cassey Topham hope to build this home in the Nottinghamshire countryside

The futuristic property has four wings or ‘hubs’, which are covered in solar panels and arranged around a sunken courtyard.

Designed to shield the couple from 
prying eyes, it will also boast a snooker room, gym, jacuzzi, 
acoustically-sealed pods and even staff quarters.

It’s certainly a very long way from their old home, a £89,950 ex-council house in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire.

Just after their Euromillions 
windfall, in February 2012, Mr Topham told a press conference: ‘I have 
often painted these huge houses and wondered what it would be like to 
live in one. Now I can find out.’

Serenity’s architects describe the property as a ‘21st century update of the traditional country house’.

Estate: The property is set in a country park which the couple bought for £1.2million

The plans involve demolishing a 1930s mansion overlooking a country park, which the couple bought for £1.2million last year.

Its most remarkable feature is its 
underground garage, built to accommodate the couple’s growing collection
of cars. After their windfall they swapped their Peugeot 107 city car 
for a Jaguar XKR-S and Range Rover Evoque,  worth a combined £150,000.

Mr Topham is also said to have also splashed out on a Porsche and Aston 
Martin DB9.

The cars will be glimpsed through a waterfall, created from rainwater which will collect in a pool at the centre of the house.

This will cascade into a second pool 
below, producing a ‘water curtain’. In a statement released through 
their architects yesterday, Mr Topham and his 23-year-old wife, a former
Iceland supermarket supervisor, said: ‘Must-haves [for the new house] 
included five bedrooms, a dramatic sweeping staircase, a large garage 
and a grotto-style pool.

Jackpot: Mr and Mrs Topham won £45million on the EuroMillions lottery last February

Generous: The pair have paid off relatives' mortgages and given millions away to close friends

‘We also spent a lot of time debating 
with the architect how the rooms would be used and the split between 
open plan and entertaining spaces versus cosy, snug rooms.  We were very
clear we didn’t want to live in a glass box. At the very top of our 
wish list was a strong desire to keep the design contemporary yet 
familiar, and flexible enough to accommodate a future family.’

They told London-based architects Baca the new home had to be ‘luxurious, environmentally-friendly and playful.’

The four hubs will be divided into ‘a 
formal entertaining hub, a family hub, games hub and an annex’, with a 
half-storey of steps between each. 

Richard Coutts, of Baca, said: 
‘Visitors arrive via a grand hall where a majestic staircase sweeps up 
to a cinema room and study, contained in two acoustically sealed pods 
hovering above a drawing room.’

The Nottinghamshire project is likely 
to be one of the most ambitious new homes built in the UK. Baca 
submitted an application yesterday, but planners are unlikely to 
consider it until the summer.

Last night Mr Topham’s father, Brian, 
said the couple were enjoying an extended touring holiday in America. He
said they had had a ‘lot of input’ into the design of their planned 
home, adding: ‘I’m not going to say where the house will be built but it
is quite local.

‘Matt has no plans to move – all his friends are around here.’
