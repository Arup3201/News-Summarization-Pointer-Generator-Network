A decorated Navy pilot turned U.S. Senate candidate from Nebraska who once went down over China is catching heat from fellow soldiers over claims he's a hero.

Shane Osborn, 39, was awarded the Navy's highest honor for piloting prowess after he skillfully maneuvered to land his damaged spy plane in April 2001, but as the midterm elections heat up, critics are becoming more vocal in decrying his decision as counter to centuries of Navy tradition.

'Once they landed on land, it was U.S. property. You shouldn't surrender it,' prominent naval analyst Norman Polmar told the Omaha World-Herald.

Hero? A decorated Navy pilot who's turned himself into a Republican U.S. Senate hopeful in Nebraska is facing questions about the 2001 crash landing in China that made him a hero

Disaster averted? Osborn, seen here hugging his girlfriend after returning home from being held in China for 11 days, piloted a nearly unflyable spy plane to safety in China in 2001

According to some of the Republican's detractors, Osborn was wrong when he piloted the surveillance plane, which had collided with a Chinese fighter plane, onto China's island of Hainan.

Some of them believe he should have flown the plane and all its 23 crewmen into the South China Sea.

'Our standing order was "If you can't get back to the carrier, you put it down in the water,”' said long-serving Navy pilot from Nebraska Danny Mason.

'In the 20 years I was flying — any aircraft — you weren't going to take it into China,' Mason told the World-Herald.

Osborn and his crew began destroying sensitive gear and surveillance devices as soon as it became clear they were going in for a landing at Hainan.

'I would not have let (the Chinese) take that airplane. I would have left it a smoldering hulk,' said Polmar.

Osborn
 and his crew ultimately surrendered to armed Chinese soldiers. They 
destroyed what they could, though they couldn't get it all and the plane
 wound up in the hands of the Chinese.

'This is, like, the worst armchair quarterbacking in the history of 
quarterbacking,' Osborn says of his naysayers. 'My job was to bring my crew home, safely 
and alive at that point. That's what I did. I didn't want anyone getting
 shot. That wouldn't do any good.'

He
 and his crew were released after being detained 11 days. The pilot 
became a media darling and was invited to dinner at the White House for 
dinner and mentioned in several speeches made by George W. Bush.

But
 in addition to his decision to land in China, Osborn is being attacked 
for his continued references to his naval record and accomplishments as 
part of his campaign.

According to the World-Herald, Osborn writes in a fundraising mailer:

'I
 set an undisputed world record by flying a nearly un-flyable EP-3 Spy 
Plane INVERTED FOR NEARLY TWO MILES — WITH NO INSTRUMENTS AND ONLY 50% 
POWER.'

Did the right thing? Now that he's running for Senate, some detractors--many of them military vets--are saying he broke with centuries of Navy tradition by allowing the plane to land in the hands of the Chinese

That doesn't sit well with vets like retired Air Force brigadier general Carl Lorenzen.

'All these people who came back from World War II, nobody ever bragged about their experiences. This is bragging,' said  'I've never seen this kind of behavior from an officer in the military.'

But Osborn refuses to apologize to men like Lorenzen.

'I flew combat missions in Afghanistan. I flew combat missions in Iraq. It is absolutely a big part of my campaign,' Osborn said.

And he says it's more important now than ever before that candidates like him make it into Congress.

'We have the lowest number of veterans in the United States Senate in the history of this country,' he said.
