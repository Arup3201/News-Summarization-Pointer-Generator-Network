The next generation Xbox console will require Microsoft's Kinect motion sensors to be connected when playing games, according to games industry sources.

The machine - the follow up to the hugely successful Xbox 360 - will also feature new-look control pads and be capable of simultaneously running apps alongside video games.

Having Kinect as a requirement has 
raised eyebrows among gamers as it is still widely criticised by 'hardcore' gamers for being a gimmick that adds little value to games.

Successor: The Xbox 360 is a hugely popular system, but recent games have showed a gulf in the graphical quality between its aging hardware and the current crop of PCs

That's despite Microsoft having sold 20million of the motion-sensor units.

The new machine is codenamed Durango. A source who is said to have previously revealed details on games consoles, told Kotaku he has had access to the development kits.

The source went on to describe the graphical leap between Durango and the current 360 to echo the difference between Halo 2 on the original Xbox and Crysis on a high-powered PC.

The website claims that a new Kinect-style motion control will be included with every Durango sold, and must be plugged in and calibrated for the console to even function.

It will also 'always be watching you', with a new camera able to track up to six individual skeletons in the same room at all times.

This would suggest that the system could instantly identity the person and also be related to the recently-patented Microsoft system for monitoring or charging users based on who is watching what.

The quality of the Kinect camera has been improved, too, with reports that it is capable of tracking thumb movement or recognise when your hand is open and closed.

Other reports suggest it can also recognise when you are angry, sad and exited.

Big reveal: Sony are almost certain to showcase their next-gen console on February 20

The next Xbox console could require gamers to be permanently connected to the internet - ruling out the use of second-hand games, according to a magazine report.

The next-generation console will 'be absolutely committed to online functionality', says the magazine, quoting sources with first-hand experience of Microsoft's latest console.

Gamers will be required to activate games in the same way as most other software from Microsoft and other publishers is already activated online, the report in Edge magazine claimed.

This would mean that the game is tied to the console it is activated on, and to the Xbox Live account activating it, making it impossible to sell on old games.

An activation system would check that you are the registered user of the game each time you start it up - you wouldn't even be able to lend it to a friend.

The site claims the new Xbox will run on custom hardware, including an 8-core, 64-bit CPU running at 1.6ghz, 800mhz DirectX11 graphics processor units and custom hardware blocks to take help take the pressure off the CPU.

The console is also reportedly capable of delivering stereo 3D content and ships with built-in wifi. Audio output will be via either HDMI or S/PDIF (optical) and can support 7.1 channels.

It will ship with 500GB hard drive, too.

Cleverly, Durango titles can be designed in sections, so the now mandatory installations can take place automatically while you play.

Sadly, Kotaku claims that Xbox 360 controllers will not work with Durango as Microsoft are using what they call a 'new wireless technology'.

Sony, meanwhile, have kept their hand even closer to their chest regarding their next-generation console.

However, it is widely expected that they will reveal their PS3 successor at a major event in New York City on Feburary 20.

Microsoft will likely wait until E3 to make an announcement with the console expected to retail at the end of the year.
