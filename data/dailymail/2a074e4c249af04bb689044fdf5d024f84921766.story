Police missed 11 opportunities to save the life of a young mother who was murdered by her violent ex-partner.

Casey Brittle, 21, was kicked and punched to death in front of her two-year-old daughter after suffering years of abuse.

The little girl walked into the room where her father Sanchez Williams was carrying out the attack and afterwards stayed with her unconscious mother for two hours.

Let down: Casey Brittle repeatedly called police before she was murdered by Sanchez Williams in front of her two-year-old daughter

Yesterday, Nottinghamshire Police were savaged for a series of failings by officers.

Williams, 27, was known for his 
violence and had a long criminal record but police failed to take ‘basic
 actions’ to protect Miss Brittle.

The force was called 11 times by the 
mother herself, neighbours or witnesses, to report attacks or threats 
between September 2008 and August 2010.

But an independent report found police
 never questioned why she repeatedly complained of domestic violence 
before they refused help.

Prison: Sanchez Williams was jailed for life after he admitted murdering Casey at her home in front of their daughter

Miss Brittle was so scared of her 
ex-partner she ‘played down’ the incidents and was reluctant to press 
charges.

As a result, Williams was never charged with a criminal offence
 in relation to her.

A neighbour heard her daughter screaming ‘I want my mummy’ as she was attacked at her home in Nottingham in October last year.

Miss Brittle died in hospital from 27 
injuries to her head, including a jaw fractured on both sides, caused by
 being punched, kicked and stamped on.

In March, Williams was jailed for life with a minimum of 15 years after admitting murder.

The report by the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission said the force did not have a domestic abuse 
policy for most of the period of her ordeal and officers repeatedly 
failed to intervene effectively, with many ‘unclear about what to do’.

It said key paperwork was not 
submitted, a domestic abuse unit was left in the dark, procedures were 
not understood and bail conditions were not imposed on Williams to keep 
him away.

The IPCC investigation found failures by officers in individual incidents, which included:1. A lack of understanding of the force's domestic abuse policy and procedures

2. Not submitting risk assessment forms to the domestic abuse unit

3. A lack of positive action against Williams or following lines of enquiry

4. Bail conditions preventing contact with Casey not being imposed on Williams

5. Incidents were not given the appropriate coding or entered on the crime recording system that would have given colleagues a better chance of assessing the risk posed to Casey

In June 2010, Williams threw Miss 
Brittle into a changing room at the shop where she worked. She emerged 
shaken with red marks on her neck. But there was no CCTV of the attack 
and police inquiries were dropped.

In August 2010, he head-butted her and
 threw her into a shopping mall photo booth. She refused to press 
charges and an inexperienced officer did not arrest him.

Six officers have been disciplined and four reprimanded.

Last night, Miss Brittle’s mother 
Victoria Blower said: ‘Mistakes were made, but there is only one person 
responsible for my daughter’s death and that is Williams.

‘Maybe one small change in the way 
things were handled could have saved her, or maybe nothing was ever 
going to prevent him murdering Casey.’

Chief Constable Paul Broadbent said: ‘We could and should have done more. That is a cause of deep and lasting regret.’
