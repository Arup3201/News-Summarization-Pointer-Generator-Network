More than 500 million people use public transport in New South Wales each year so you'd expect being a train driver you'd be pretty busy getting everyone from A to B on time.

But a report has shown that's not the case, finding that train drivers have a lot of down time waiting around, and not actually doing what they're employed for.

It seems in NSW they continue to spend less than 30 per cent of their working time actually driving trains, sometimes waiting up to three hours for a train to arrive to begin their shifts.

An Auditors General report found train drivers are spending less than 30 percent actually operating trains

Rail Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, Alex Claassens says it's not the choice of drivers to operate at minimal times because they have to adhere to certain restrictions on operating hours

The Auditor General report says the benchmark compared poorly to the North American average of 55 per cent and European average of 50 per cent.

Rail Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, Alex Claassens says it's not the choice of drivers to operate at minimal times.

'The train driving times are due to the rules that drivers have to adhere to, set by the Office of the national safety regulator,' he said.

'All trains have the same rules and there are strict guidelines on the hours we are allow to drive.'

Mr Claassens said train drivers who do the country runs work about a 10 hour shift whereas those who do the usual suburban or city runs will work about an eight or nine hour shift. 

'The reality is train drivers don't decide what to do, the work is rostered for them and the rules have been the same for the last 20 years,' he said.

'We take 10 minutes to check paperwork, then there's a schedule to give the train a service, time to prepare the train and make it safe and fit for passengers.'

Rail Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, Alex Claassens says we shouldn't compare our system with American systems because they are completely different

The Auditor Generals report also found six out of 16 suburban and intercity lines did not achieve the target in the last financial year

'Some companies use other people to do that work but not in NSW.

He says in varying hours of driving time you have to take into account the location, admitting that in country locations, the frequency of trains is less so drivers are waiting around more.

Mr Claassens has also criticised the government for introducing a computer system to schedule drivers which he believes is nowhere near as efficient as when staff used to do it.

'Over the years we've challenged it, it's not efficient,' he said.

'We also shouldn't compare to American systems because they don't have a system like ours.' 

The report also found Sydney trains overall exceeded their on time running target, however six out of 16 suburban and intercity lines did not achieve the target in the last financial year.

And a very frustrating result that it has been 11 years since the regional passenger TrainLink service, the former CountryLink, achieved it's on time running target of 78 per cent.

'On-time running results should be published for outer metropolitan bus regions,' said the Auditor-General. 

Buses too weren't exempt, with five of the 14 metropolitan bus regions were below the target, although good news for ferry users with the services continuing to achieve the highest on time running performance. 

The report also found complaints coming from Sydney train and NSW Trains commuters didn't go unnoticed, recording more than a 30 per cent increase in their first year of operation, mainly due to new timetables introduced

Rail Tram and Bus Union NSW secretary, Alex Claassens says a number of the complaints are due to staff not being able to help commuters with their Opal cards, questions, topping up or selling them to customers

Complaints coming from Sydney train and NSW Trains commuters didn't go unnoticed, recording more than a 30 per cent increase in their first year of operation, mainly due to new timetables introduced. 

Mr Claassens said the rise is complaints is probably due to rail staff not being able to help commuters with questions about their Opal cards.

'The government made a decision for us not to have anything to do with the Opal card, so staff can't help, we're the only system in the world where you can't help top up tickets and sell the,' he said.

'It's all about customer service and that's not customer service.' 

In light of this the new Opal card has been a hit used for 27,635,000 rail journeys, 1,161,000 bus journeys and 895,000 ferry journeys in the last financial year.

A great plus for commuters, the system providing 5.1 million free journeys.  

Annual leave also seems to be a problem for the states transport agencies with over 3,000 employees accruing more than 35 days of annual leave at June 30 this year. 

'All transport agencies should do more to reduce excessive annual leave balances,' he said.

The report did show that more people are starting to use public transport for their everyday commute with the total passenger journeys increasing from 547 million to 560 million in 2013-2014, a 2.4 percent jump.
