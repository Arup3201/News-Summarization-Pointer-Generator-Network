A second woman has been charged in the 2006 cold case murder of an Oklahoma teenager who's body was discovered only days after his high school graduation.

Dayna Marie Hargrove, 27, was arrested Friday for her alleged part in the death of Jarret Clark.

She was booked into Wagoner County Jail on conspiracy to commit first degree murder, murder in the first degree, conspiracy to commit conspiracy after the fact in first degree murder, and being an accessory after the fact, KJRH reports.

Arrested within a week of one another, Courtney Manzer and Danya Marie Hargrove face first degree murder charges in the 2006 cold case death of Jarret Clark

Clark, an 18-year-old Broken Arrow High School student, was found dead in Fort Gibson Lake.

The medical examiner listed his cause of death as drowning, according to News On 6.

Authorities discovered that Clark had sustained several blows to the back of his head before drowning.

Another man, Anthony Scott Wallen, later admitted to the beating.

It's believed that after Clark was unconscious, Miller parked in a 'lookout position' while co-conspirators put Clark's body in a pickup truck then sent him into the lake.

Jarret Clark, 18, had only just graduated high school a few days before his body was discovered in Fort Gibson Lake

Miller later lied to investigators about Clark being intoxicated and exactly who was at the campsite.

The case lay dormant until earlier this week when Courtney Manzer, 24, was arrested and charged with first degree murder.

Manzer was one of the last people to see Clark alive, investigators said.
