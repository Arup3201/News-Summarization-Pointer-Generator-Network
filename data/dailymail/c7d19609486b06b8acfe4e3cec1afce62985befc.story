France defender Mamadou Sakho is best known for his no-nonsense, tough-tackling defending - but he showed off his more subtle freestyling skills during training.

The Liverpool centre back performed keepy-ups before controlling the ball expertly on his knee.

The 24-year-old missed France's 2-0 last-16 victory over Nigeria through injury but has played a crucial role for Les Bleus so far in the tournament.
