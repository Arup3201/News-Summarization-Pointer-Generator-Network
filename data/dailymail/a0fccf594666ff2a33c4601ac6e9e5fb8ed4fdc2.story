Amazing footage of a migrating humpback whale caught on a GoPro camera off the coast of Sydney has emerged. 

Tourist Michael Theis captured the moments the chilled out creature peered out of the water to say hello to the wildlife lovers while he was on a tour with Whale Watching Sydney.

The excited boatload of people had their cameras at the ready as the amazing creature spent half an hour with the tour on Monday afternoon.

The boat was about nine miles off shore when the friendly whale spent half an hour floating in the sun catching up on some rays after days of unseasonable weather, it was the wettest August in 16 years.

Richard Ford, manager of Whale Watching Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'We do daily tours and from this time of year till December we normally see quite a lot of whales because they are migrating south back towards the Antarctic. 

'We go out of the harbour and off the coast twice a day and it is quite usual for them to be that inquisitive.

This was the moment the friendly whale came out to play with the onlookers off the coast of Sydney 

'They go north to breed and give birth and on the way back they are much more relaxed. 

'When they are going north they are  are focussed. On the way back they have to make sure the babies are strong going south because they will encounter killer whales' he said. 

Mr Ford, who has owned the company with his brother Will since 2000, added:  'It is called a mugging when they come up to the boat like this.  

Mr Ford said: 'We go out of the harbour and off the coast twice a day and it is quite usual for them to be that inquisitive'

The whales are much more relaxed on their journey back to the Antarctic after giving birth

 'It gave our passengers a special afternoon and you can hear that in the footage, they were amazed.' 

'We still have whales off the coast of Sydney for another three months until early December with mothers and their newborn calves making an appearance in the next four weeks or so.

'It's been a record year with about 20,000 whales on this migration from the Antarctic and about 2000 calves born as they increase their numbers by about 10 per cent each year' he added.
