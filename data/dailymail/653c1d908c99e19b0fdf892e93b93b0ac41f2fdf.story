Mark Fournier received the maximum fine possible for wearing the Nazi style uniform while on a stag do in Val Thorens

A Tory MP who was caught at a Nazi-themed party had organised the event himself, a report revealed yesterday.

Aiden Burley, 34, had said later that he wished he had left the party in France ‘as soon as I realised what was happening’.

But he had set up the stag do and even purchased an SS uniform for a friend to wear, according to a long-delayed report by Tory peer and lawyer Lord Gold.

Mr Burley, MP for Cannock Chase, was unaware that donning the outfit was an offence in France, the document claimed.

He also said the choice of costume was inspired by the British comic association with aspects of the war’ and denied any ‘political motivation’.

The report concluded: ‘Mr Burley is not a bad man, still less a racist or anti-Semite. However, his actions were stupid and offensive, and the conclusions and recommendations reflect that.’

Mr Burley was sacked as a ministerial aide after being caught at the 2011 party in the ski resort of Val Thorens, where he was best man.

The groom was wearing the uniform and guests made toasts to the Third Reich.

He remains a MP. But Labour MP Ian Austin, whose father was a Jewish refugee from Czechoslovakia whose family perished at Treblinka concentration camp, said he was unfit to be in parliament.

Mr Austin said: ‘This is not a student prank and it wasn’t as he claimed at the time a fancy dress party. It was grown men in their 30s one of them an MP and their behaviour was a disgrace.

‘He didn’t tell the truth at the time and it beggars belief the Tory party would believe him now. I think he’s unfit to be a member of the British parliament.’

The Oxford graduate was given the uniform by Conservative MP Aidan Burley. He will now have to pay a total of 2000 pounds in fines and costs, after one of the Jewish groups which complained said pretending to be a Nazi was 'not a schoolboy joke'

The
 report recommends Mr Burley visit Auschwitz concentration camp, which 
he since has but courted more controversy when he was seen using his 
mobile phone there.

It was 
finally published last night after the conviction of his friend, Oxford 
graduate Mark Fournier who was fined by a French court for wearing the 
uniform.

Fournier, 36, will
 have to pay £2000 in fines and costs. Guests chanted ‘Hitler, Hitler, 
Hitler’, while one raised a toast to the ‘Third Reich’ during the dinner
 party in December 2011, a police tribunal in Albertville heard.

Mr
 Fournier’s brother, 38-year-old John Fournier, was saying of Mr Burley 
at the party: ‘This man is a Tory MP. He went to Oxford. A Tory boy. He 
was the candidate for Berlin East.’ Wearing the uniform and insignia of 
an organisation found guilty of crimes against humanity is against the 
law in France.

He was fined
 around £1200 and ordered to pay damages and interest of just over £800 
to ADIF, a French group which supports Holocaust victims.

Mr Fournier, who is not believed to have attended the tribunal, is said to have been unemployed since the scandal happened.

During
 his trial, his defence lawyer had asked prosecutors to show him mercy 
because Prince Harry once got away with wearing an Afrika Korps uniform 
and swastika insignia at a party.

His
 defence argued that he had asked his MP friend if it was against the 
law to wear a Nazi uniform in France and he told him ‘no’.’

A
 Conservative party spokesman said: ‘Two years ago, the party 
investigated this matter. The findings of that investigation were that 
Aidan Burley behaved in a manner which was offensive and foolish, and 
that his behaviour was completely unacceptable. What he did was wrong.

‘That
 is why, two years ago, he was removed from his post as parliamentary 
private secretary. He has since apologised publicly and sought to make 
amends, including by visiting Auschwitz.’
