The National Transportation Safety Board is reporting a 'near miss' between an Alaska Airlines passenger jet and a cargo plane over Anchorage's Fire Island south of the city's main airport.

Agency spokesman Clint Johnson says the Alaska Airlines flight inbound from Portland, Oregon, was starting to land at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport just after 3 p.m. Tuesday when air traffic controllers gave instructions for a 'go-around.'

The order was given to avoid an Ace Air Cargo Beechcraft 1900 prop-jet taking off for Sand Point from the airport's north-south runway.

Johnson says the passenger jet veered right and the cargo plane turned in the same direction. The aircraft passed within a quarter-mile of each other at the same elevation.

The Alaska Airlines jet, Flight 135, landed safely. The jet was carrying 143 passengers and five crew members.

The close proximity of the aircraft was enough for the agency to count the incident as a 'near miss.'

Johnson said the aircraft were so close at least one pilot spotted the other plane.

He said the NTSB's investigation, which has just begun, is being headed up by a senior air traffic control specialist based in Washington, D.C.

The agency will review data from both the Anchorage control tower and the two aircraft involved.

Todd Erickson, Ace Air Cargo's chief pilot, said the Ace aircraft was aware of the situation and in contact with the control tower the entire time.

'There was no danger,' Erickson said, according to Alaska Dispatch. 'Once Alaska Airlines radioed they had the 1900 in sight, our crew had no cause for concern.'

A spokeswoman for Alaska Airlines said the Boeing 737 aircraft was equipped with a collision avoidance system, which alerted the crew that the other aircraft was close by.

This prompted the pilots to increase altitude.
