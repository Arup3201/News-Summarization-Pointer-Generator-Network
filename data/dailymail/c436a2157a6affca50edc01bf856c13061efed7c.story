A brave teenager battling an aggressive form of leukemia, who fulfilled her dying wish to marry her high school sweetheart last month, died on Wednesday night.

Leslie Rivera, 18, of Murrieta, California, married the love of her life, Daniel Mendez, in a deeply emotional ceremony, just weeks before her death.

The celebrity wedding planner who helped with the Make-A-Wish ceremony, David Tutera wrote on his Facebook page this morning: 'It's with a heavy heart to tell you that my beautiful Make-A-Wish America bride, Leslie, peacefully passed away last night with her husband Daniel and her family by her side.

Loyal: Battling terminal leukemia, Leslie spent most of her time in hospital, always with Daniel at her side

One request: When Rivera was referred to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, her only request was clear. With only months to live she wanted to get married, and she did on November 21

David Tutera posted a tribute message to Leslie on Facebook today

'The love and prayers that you sent 
to her were felt, she luckily knew just how much she was loved, and 
today my wish is for each and every one of you to remember how precious 
our time on earth is.'

Rivera
 was diagnosed with the terminal disease in April. Since her diagnosis, 
she had been loyally looked after by her boyfriend Daniel Mendez.

When Rivera was referred to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, her only request was clear. With only months to live she wanted to get married, and she did on November 21.

Leslie and Daniel met at an anti-racism group on campus in October 2012, and have been inseparable ever since. 

After graduating from high school in April, Leslie had to spend most of her time in hospital, always with Daniel at her side. 

She passed the hours watching Unveiled and My Fair Wedding, the shows starring celebrity wedding planner David Tutera. So Make-A-Wish reached out to Tutera to get him on board.

Sarah Pizzaruso of the foundation explained that with Leslie's condition they knew they 'had to act fast.'

Shock: Leslie spent a lot of time watching celebrity wedding planner David Tutera. And he turned up personally at her dress fitting to surprise her

'Within days, David was on board... and his team jumped into action to plan every single detail of her day,' Pizzaruso said.

'Vendors jumped at the chance to be involved in this incredible day, and David's website had hundreds of people reaching out to help.'

Tutera surprised Leslie with a personal appearance at her dress fitting in Costa Mesa earlier in November. 'The best part of this day,' he said, 'is seeing that she's a normal bride.'

Together, Leslie and the sought-after planner worked out the details of her special day. Leslie requested a wedding similar to the one in the Twilight movie.

Love: 'Watching Daniel care for her, assisting her walking, holding her hands during the vows - there is no question these two are meant to be together,' Pizzaruso said

Happiness: 'Leslie, Daniel and their families had time to celebrate, laugh and dance - something that really hasn't been in the plans for the last several months,' Pizzaruso added

Bride: Leslie spent the day before the wedding in hospital getting transfusions. Then the big day went perfectly

The big day came on Thursday November 21 at Rancho Las Lomas in Orange County, and her bridal wishes such as a photo booth and chocolate covered strawberries were taken care of.

Leslie spent the day before the ceremony getting transfusions in hospital. Then the beautiful wedding went perfectly.

Pizzaruso explained: 'Watching Leslie absolutely radiate in front of her guests, greeting people with a smile, staring so lovingly at her new husband as they toasted the crowd - you would have never known the challenges she is going through.

'And watching Daniel care for her, assisting her walking, holding her hands during the vows - there is no question these two are meant to be together.'

Pizzaruso said that fulfilling kids' 
'truest wish', the 'happiest thing they can imagine' and giving their 
families a 'chance to focus on something other than doctors, hospitals 
and needles' is the goal of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

'That's
 what David and his team made happen. Leslie, Daniel and their families 
had time to celebrate, laugh and dance - something that really hasn't 
been in the plans for the last several months,' she added.
