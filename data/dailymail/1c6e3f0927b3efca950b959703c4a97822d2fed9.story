A group of chimpanzees had to be lured back to their enclosure with ice cream and fizzy drinks after they made their way into an area of the zoo they should not have been in.

Zookeepers at Twycross Zoo in Warwickshire had to coax the chimps out of a secure service area this morning by offering them sweet treats - and ice cream for breakfast left them 'a little excited'.

The zoo was closed for less than two hours yesterday due to 'safety procedures', but 'no people or chimps were harmed during the incident'.

Keepers encouraged the chimps back into their normal living areas with ice cream and fizzy drinks

A spokesperson from the zoo confirmed that some of the chimpanzees found their way into a secure service area within their enclosure.

A statement on the zoo’s website said: 'This required closure of the zoo whilst keepers encouraged the chimps back into their normal living areas with ice cream and fizzy drinks.

'At no time were the public at risk, and no people or chimps were harmed during the incident, however it is part of our safety procedures that we close the zoo whilst such events are resolved.

'Investigations will commence internally now the situation has been resolved into how the animals escaped.

'The zoo reopened at 11.30am today and all of the chimps are fine, if not a little excited about having ice cream for breakfast. They are all on view to the public as normal.'

Police attended the zoo after receiving a
call and confirmed that there was no danger to anyone in the park and 
there were no animals on the loose.

A spokeswoman for Leicestershire Police said: 'A call came in at 9.35 this morning from the zoo to let us know that some chimpanzees, that were in the process of being moved from one building to another, had escaped and in the process of this they have perhaps gone into an area of that building that they shouldn’t have been in.

'They don’t appear to have actually physically escaped. As a precaution, we’ve been called by the zoo.'

This is the second time in the space of a month that the chimps at Twycross Zoo have found themselves in the news.

A Twycross Zoo chimp who starred as 007 in TV adverts for PG Tips tea died on July 8 aged 37 following a very short illness.

Louis the chimpanzee parodied James Bond in adverts for the brand during the 1970s and 1980s.

Curator Dr Charlotte Macdonald said: 'Louis was a very gentle and laid-back chimp - a favourite with everyone.

'Born at Twycross, he was one of the original PG Tips chimps.

'Although gone, Louis will never be forgotten - he will always be a member of our Twycross Zoo chimp family.'

The chimp’s 42-year-old partner Choppers, who also starred in the ads, remains at the zoo.

Dr MacDonald added: 'She is doing well and will be monitored closely over the next couple of weeks by the animal team.

'She will be introduced to some of the other chimps in the near future.'

The zoo is 'renowned as a specialist primate zoo and has a wide variety of monkeys and apes', according to its website.

It is set in more than 80 acres and is home to around 900 animals.

The website says the zookeepers present regular talks and feeds where 'people can learn a bit more about some of our animals such as the chimpanzees'.
