Resplendent in a chic burgundy coat and a killer spiky necklace, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was on top fashionable form as she stepped out in The Hague today.

But for once, she had competition, which arrived in the form of the ever-fashionable Queen Letizia of Spain, who with her husband King Felipe, landed in the Dutch capital Amsterdam this morning to begin a tour of the Netherlands.

Letizia and Maxima didn't have it all their own way, however, and were run close in the style stakes by their dapper husbands, with King Felipe cutting a particularly dashing figure in his pinstriped suit.

Big arrival: The Spanish royals arrived in the Hague today to begin a tour of the Netherlands

Glamorous: Letizia, 42, opted for a crimson ensemble while her Dutch counterpart Maxima chose burgundy

Greeting: King Willem-Alexander looked absolutely delighted to see his Spanish royal guests arrive

Pleased to see you: The Netherlands' Willem-Alexander and Spain's Felipe looked delighted to see each other

The two kings, who last met during a trip to address the UN General Assembly in New York late last month, seemed pleased to see each other with King Willem-Alexander, 47, enveloping Felipe, 46, in a warm bear-hug.

Letizia, 42, and Maxima, 43, who spent much of the UN meeting seated together, also appeared delighted to be together again, exchanging warm kisses and smiles as they met on the steps of the Noordeinde Palace.

The two couples, who were joined for a meeting by Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, are among the youngest - and newest - monarchs in Europe, with King Willem-Alexander taking the Dutch throne last year and King Felipe ascending to the Spanish in June.

His father, 76-year-old Juan-Carlos, said at the time that the decision was made because 'I don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles'.

He formally abdicated on the 18th June, making him the fourth European monarch to do so in less than a year - Pope Benedict XVI, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and King Albert II of Belgium having all stepped down in 2013.

Despite the abdications of Queen Beatrix and King Juan-Carlos, the Queen has stated that she has no plans to abdicate, with Buckingham Palace sources confirming that she will never relinquish the British throne.

One monarch who may yet do so is Denmark's Queen Margrethe, 74, who has been on the Danish throne for 42 years and has an heir, Crown Prince Frederik, of the same age as King Felipe.

However, despite claims in an Australian magazine that an announcement is imminent, sources close to the Danish queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as 'all lies'.

For their part, Letizia and Felipe have enjoyed a busy three months since ascending to the Spanish throne on the 19th June, with several international tours already under their belt.

More recently, the pair have attended events all over Spain, including a trip to the Valle Del Cicados Institute in Calahorra last week, and have spearheaded major national events such as Spanish National Day on Sunday.

But while Letizia and Felipe's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling.

Since the crash, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families.

She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil.

More recently, the Dutch royals have found themselves cheered to the rafters during public appearances, most notably when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day], along with the former Queen Beatrix, 76

Maxima has also become a familiar sight at charity events around the Netherlands, with her most recent outing being at a symposium organised by women's rights activists in Amsterdam, which celebrated the 40th birthday of a Dutch law banning domestic violence.
