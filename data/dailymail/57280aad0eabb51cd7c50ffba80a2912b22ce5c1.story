Enchanted: The children look longingly after the fairy when she exits and disappears from the room 

The woman - whose arrival is accompanied by the track When You Wish Upon A Star - asks each of the children if they know who she is.

'Tinkerbell?' one little girl guesses, looking at the prankster's green outfit and wings. 

'I'm the tooth fairy,' the lady reveals, prompting gasps of excitement and big grins from her audience.

She then announces that she's going to clean everyone's teeth and make them 'pearly white.'

Magic trick: The young patients are told to close their eyes and open their mouths wide

Pact: 'You're going to have to promise me that you're not going to tell anybody I was here?' the fairy instructs

But before she performs her magic trick, she asks each patient to keep her visit a secret.

'You're going to have to promise me that you're not going to tell anybody I was here?' she instructs.

When each of the children agree to the deal, they're instructed to  close their eyes and open their mouths wide.

'Clean the teeth for me and make them pearly white,' the fairy exclaims waving her wand. She then disappears from the room, with each of the children looking longingly after her.

Their parents then return along with the dentist.

'How did your teeth get so white?' the surgeon asks, playing along with the stunt.

The children squirm in the chair as they stick to the fairy's pact and refuse to divulge details about their magical encounters.

However, a couple break their silence.

'The tooth fairy came inside and then she brushed my teeth with her wand,' one girl tells her mother.
