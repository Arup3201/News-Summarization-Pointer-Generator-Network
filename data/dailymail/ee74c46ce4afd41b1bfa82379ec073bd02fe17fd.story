It is a classic David and Goliath fight.

Food giant Unilever has launched a lawsuit against San Francisco firm Hampton Creek, claiming it is misleading consumers by selling its plant based product, called Just Mayo, as mayonnaise.

Hampton Creek boss Josh Tetrick told MailOnline the action is 'bullying', and believes it could help the firm by drawing publicity to its product.

Hampton Creek sells a range of its egless product, called Just Mayo, in supermarkets across the Us, and is carried by Costco and Whole Foods among others.

Hampton Creek, based in San Francisco, analyzed thousands of plants to a mix that can replicate mayonnaise.

Its best-known product, Just Mayo, is a mayonnaise that uses a type of Canadian yellow pea as a substitute for eggs. 

the firm also makes a range of flavoured mayonnaise products, and cookie dough, and its products are available  at Costco, Dollar Tree, Walmart and Whole Foods.

'This is just bullying, but it could be a very positive thing for us,' he said.

'This is just antiquated horse and buggy mindsets, this just isn't applicable -it's silly.

The complaint accuses Hampton creek of false advertising. 

'This is a civil action for false advertising and unfair competition under federal and state law,' the suit, filed in New Jersey, says.

'Hampton Creek sells a sandwich spread named Just Mayo in direct competition with Unilever's Best Foods and Hellmann's brands of mayonnaise.

'Despite its name, Just Mayo does not contain just mayonnaise. 

'In fact, it is not mayonnaise at all. 

'Rather, it is a plant-based vegan alternative to real mayonnaise.'

A Unilever Spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We are a strong supporter of innovation both within and outside our company. 

'Our concern here is not about innovation, it is about misleading labelling as it is simply not accurate to label the Hampton Creek product as 'Mayo' or to reinforce the link with images of ingredients, in this case eggs, that are not even used. 

'Contrastingly, our Hellman's brand is made from real eggs that are cage free and deliver great taste from natural sources. 

'We simply wish to defend both consumers from being misled and also our brand.' 

Fans of Hampton Creek have flocked to an online petition created by chef and travel presenter Andrew Zimmermn, which has attracted over 10,000 signatures.

'When a 60 billion dollar company flexes its muscles to prevent a good-for-the-world startup company from succeeding, there are only two words for that: corporate bullying,' he said. 

Tetrick's idea was to find a mix of easy-to-grow plants that, when mixed together in the right way, replicate the taste, nutritional values and cooking properties of an egg.

This, he believes will allow the firm to produce its substitute for mass market foods - and to allow developing worlds to grow their own versions with added nutrients. 

According to the filing, Just Mayo has already harmed sales of 'real' mayonnaise.

'Hampton Creek's literally-false name and its unsubstantiated superiority claims have already caused consumer deception and serious, irreparable harm to Unilever and to the product category the industry has taken great care to define in a way consistent.'

Tetrick says he hopes the issue will draw people to the debate over sustainability, and comes as Unilever embarks on a US ad campaign to brand itself as a sustainable firm.

'I'd be surprised if the CEO knows about it - and that he won't contact someone when he hears,' said Tetrick.

'From a legal perspective, this is why we use mayo - we got lots of legal advice so we feel we are on the right side of this.' 

'Just like Uber and airbnb, we are dealing with these issues. We think how we feed people is even more important.

'This whole system needs to be reinvented.'
