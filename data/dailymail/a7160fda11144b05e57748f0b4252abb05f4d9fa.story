The German team got some motivation help from explorer and adventurer Mike Horn during a sailing outing near their camp on Brazil’s Atlantic coast on Tuesday.

Horn talked about his exploits, which include the solo circumnavigation of the Arctic Circle and a North Pole expedition.

Germany captain Philipp Lahm was impressed, saying it was ‘incredible what the human body can achieve.’

Lahm says the presentation by the South African-born Swiss explorer showed that, ‘we must be well prepared, and have to respect the opponent.’

Lahm also admitted he is not sure where he will play in the German side at the World Cup.

Injuries are forcing coach Joachim Low to have another look at his options - forward Marco Reus has been ruled out for three months after injuring his ankle in a warm game against Armenia.

The attacking midfielder suffered partial ligament tear in his left ankle after a tussle with Artur Yedigaryan during his side's 6-1 victory.

Consequently, Lahm is likely to be fielded as a defensive midfielder in Brazil rather than in his usual and preferred position as right back.

Lahm says it’s the coach’s decision and that he is ready to play in whatever position he’s thrown into. But putting Germany’s top defender in midfield could weaken the already suspect back four of Low’s team.

Lahm played as a defensive midfielder a lot this season for Bayern Munich, also because of injuries to his teammates, and filled the role surprisingly well.

That has led Low to test his captain in the new role and that’s where he played in the final warm-up match, a 6-1 win over Armenia.

‘You assume that if you played in one position in the final friendly, you will also play in the same position at the World Cup,’ Lahm said.

‘Of course I’ve spoken to the coach a lot, but it will be up to him to disclose what we discussed. At the end, it’s his decision in which position I play.’

Lahm became Germany captain four years ago, when Michael Ballack got injured and had to miss the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Loew never recalled Ballack and Lahm stayed as captain.

‘Nothing much has changed since then, except that I now have more experience. Your authority comes from your performance on the field,’ he said.

By moving into midfield, Lahm may squeeze out Bastian Schweinsteiger from the starting lineup. Schweinsteiger has been bothered by a knee injury and may not be fully fit for the June 16 opener against Portugal in Group G. Lahm sustained an ankle injury in the final club match of the season and missed most of the training camp. But the captain says he is ready now.

‘I am fine, my foot is OK, I can play,’ he said.

Low usually uses two defensive midfielders and usually they are Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira. But Khedira is only coming back after missing six months with a knee injury and Loew is unlikely to risk playing both with doubts about their fitness.

But strengthening the midfield could expose the defense. Jerome Boateng would then move to Lahm’s position as right back. But he normally plays as a central defender at Bayern and feels more comfortable in that role.

Benedikt Hoewedes is not a natural-born left back and newcomer Erik Durm may get his chance despite a lack of experience. That position has been a weak link in Loew’s team for a long time.

The two central defenders, Mats Hummels and Per Mertesacker, have not often played alongside each other and when they have, were not always the bedrock of stability.

When attacking midfielder Marco Reus got injured in the match against Armenia and had to drop out of the World Cup, Loew decided to call up a defender in his place, Shkodran Mustafi. This could be another indication that Lahm is moving into the midfield.
