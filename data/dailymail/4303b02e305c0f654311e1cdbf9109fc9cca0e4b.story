Celebrity chef Pete Evans has posted a 2,100 word rant on social media claiming that the modern Australian diet is behind the rise in autism.

Evans, who is a judge on reality cooking series My Kitchen Rules, took aim at the Heart Foundation and the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) on Wednesday as he promoted the so-called benefits of the paleo diet.

His fiery rant, which was motivated by a rude comment from a dietician on his Facebook page, challenged the idea of the Heart Foundation's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the DAA - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet.

The paleo diet, which Evans (left) is a supporter of, bans all types of dairy and grains, but promotes meat, eggs, vegetables and natural oils

The diet, which Evans is a supporter of, is based around meat, eggs, vegetables and natural oils but bans all types of dairy and grains. 

'Why has our rate of autism jumped from 1 in 10000 children in 1974, to 1 in 50 in 2014, where do you think it will be in another 40 years if it is escalating at this rate? This has grown rapidly since the guidelines have been in place!' Evans wrote.

World-recognised autism expert, Professor Cheryl Dessanayake, has been researching the disorder for 30 years and quickly dismissed the claims made by Evans.

'There is absolutely no evidence that diet is the cause of autism,' Prof Dissanayake told Women's Weekly.

'Throwaway lines can be damaging because parents will try anything to help their children.'

She said while some parents do see improvements in autistic children after changing their diet, it is thought to be related to predisposed stomach problems. 

'A number of children with autism do have gastrointestinal issues so diet may improve that and then, because they are no longer in pain, their behaviour may improve,' Prof Dissanayake said.

While Evans claimed current autism rates in children was one in 50, autism organisations say the figure for 2014 is one in 100.

The chef's fiery rant was motivated by a rude comment from a dietician on his Facebook page

But his 2,100 post wasn't just limited to autism. He also listed a number of other issues he believes the two nutrition organisations needed to address.

'Isn't it interesting that the people trusted to be delivering health advice for the public have come out not once, not twice, but so many times over the last year or so that I can't keep up with it, with a media campaign to bring down the paleo way of life by saying it is dangerous,' he wrote.

'Why is Australia fast becoming the most obese and unhealthy nations on earth? Is this because we are a nation of self-obsessed, weak-minded people with no self-control? No. Is it because we are a nation that for far too long has been told to steer clear of foods naturally high in fat, which naturally trigger our fullness hormone, and instead told to eat 6 - 8 servings of processed carbohydrate a day, and wonder why we are still hungry after eating 3 cups of rice or 6 slices of bread?'

He said the DAA and Heart Foundation had 'ignited a spark that has been inside me, which is now a raging fire in my belly'.

The Heart Foundation said they would not be engaging with Evans' Facebook post but continued to urge Australians not to go on any fad diet that eliminates any particular food group.

'The paleo diet, which seems to be very topical at the moment, in general appears to encourage people to avoid carbohydrates and dairy and eat large amounts of meat and saturated fats,' a statement read.
