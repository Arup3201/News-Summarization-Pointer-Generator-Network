The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation released a wide-ranging report on Monday declaring that the world's 'pace of change' on the rights of women and girls 'has been far too slow.

But the report, called 'No Ceilings,' comes at a time when the Foundation is under fire for accepting large cash infusions from countries that the State Department has accused of discriminating against women and committing other human rights abuses.

Those nations include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Algeria and Brunei.

ENGAGEMENT: Secretary of State John Kerry (second left) met with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud on March 5; the Clinton Foundation report mirrors the Obama administration's willingness to engage with governments of countries where women have fewer rights than men

The foundation told The New York Times that no foreign governments contributed toward producing the reports, but in the nonprofit world funds are fungible and it's unclear how anyone could wall off the project from the questionable donations.

Former president Bill Clinton defended the foundation's work Saturday in Miami, saying that millions of dollars from the UAE and the Saudis in particular had no impact on its work. 

'Do we agree with everything they do?' Clinton asked, 'No.'

'You’ve got to decide when you do this work whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.'

The report, issued simultaneously in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Chinese and Russian, is a 46-page update on progress made globally since Hillary a 1995 United Nations conference held in Beijing declared: 'Women’s rights are human rights and human rights are women’s rights.'

The foundation released its report a day after International Women's Day, an annual March 8 observance that was shortened this year in the U.S. with the beginning of Daylight Savings Time.

The symbolism of a shortchanged 23-hour American observance seemed tailor-made for the report's wordy scolding.

'Security is tenuous for women and girls, even in their own homes,' the Clinton Foundation writes in 'No Ceilings.'

'Critical barriers – including legal restrictions and limited access to resources – undermine women’s economic opportunities.'

'And women’s voices are still underrepresented in leadership positions – from legislatures to boardrooms, from peace negotiations to the media,' the report reads.

The report is long on one-two punches, acknowledging some progress on specific issues but insisting that it's unsatisfactory.

'Today, more than four out of five [national] constitutions have some mechanism to guarantee gender equality,' the foundation says, 'but rights on paper often go unenforced – and many legal barriers remain.'

'Globally, women and girls are living longer and healthier lives, and the rate of maternal mortality has nearly halved,' but 'women and girls in certain regions and communities confront high rates of HIV, poor care during pregnancy and childbirth, and limited access to family planning.'

And while 'many significant gender gaps in education have closed,' the report reads, 'gaps remain and marginalized girls lag farthest behind.'

'Poor, rural, minority, and conflict-affected girls are significantly less likely to be educated,' the authors write. 

The 'No Ceilings' report, issued March 9, 2015, traces the global progress of women since a 1995 UN conference in Beijing

The foundation's partners on the 'No Ceilings' project include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Economist Intelligence Unit, UCLA WORLD Policy Analysis Center and Fathom Information Design.

Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. Senator and first lady, is touting the report at a politicall vulnerable time. Last week the Times revealed that throughout her tenure as America's top diplomat she used only a self-hosted private email address.

That has already brought talk of subpoenas from congressional Republicans and led some groups in Washington to reconsider whether the government's responses to past Freedom of Information Act requests could possibly have been complete since Clinton's emails were not turned over to State until last last year.

Tom Fitton, presdient of Judicial Watch, told Daily Mail Online that his froup has already file nine new FOIA requests related to Clinton since the email news story broke.

'And there are a few others we may seek to reopen,' Fitton said, 'because they led us to believe they had searched her emails.'

'But obviously that hasn't been done.'

Judicial Watch said as many as 160 of its past FOIA requests against the federal government could be affected, along with 20 past and present lawsuits.
