School officials ordered two dozen elementary school students to pull down their pants so they could inspect their underwear after feces was found on the gym floor, it has been claimed.

Students as old as 11 in the tiny Texas town of Gustine were divided into girls and boys before being marched into separate rooms, distraught parents told WFAA.

They were then ordered 'to pull down their pants to check them to see if they could find anything', one mother, Maria Medina, told the channel.

Gustine Independent School District Superintendent Ken Baugh, who is investigating the claims, said the children were asked to pull down their trousers just a little.

But Medina's 11-year-old daughter Eliza said she was told to pull them down 'to where your butt is'.

'I felt uncomfortable, and I didn't want to do it,' she said. 'I felt like they violated my privacy.'

Her mother said she was furious when she learned what had happened. 

'If you can't do your job or you don't know what you're doing, you need to be fired,' she told WFAA. 'You shouldn't be here.'

Baugh said that the district does not support the decision and is looking into possible disciplinary action against the staff members involved.

He said that he hopes to interview all the staff members and have a final answer by Wednesday.

Parents have said they plan to protest against the action at a school board meeting on Thursday.

Gustine, which is about 90 miles southwest of Fort Worth, has a population of just 457.
