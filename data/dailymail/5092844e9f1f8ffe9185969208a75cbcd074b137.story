With only five weeks to go until her due date, it's time to ensure her home is ready for the new arrival.

The Duchess of Cambridge has been pictured shopping with a woman thought to be a lady-in-waiting for soft furnishings at the high-end interiors specialist Bernard Thorp in Chelsea, south-west London.

The visit last Tuesday saw 31-year-old Kate spend 45 minutes inside the shop to decorate the new nursery at Kensington Palace in central London, less than six weeks before her due date of July 13.

Non-specific: The front of the fashionable store in south-west London was decked out in light blue

Just hours earlier she had been with her
 husband Prince William, 30, and around 2,000 other guests at 
Westminster Abbey for a grand service to mark the 60th anniversary of 
the Queen’s coronation.

There she wore a delicate daisy lace dress with silver-grey ribbon detail and a soft peach shantung jacket with nude heels, before changing into a navy blue dress and magenta cardigan for her shop.

The front of the store was decked out in light blue, but there was no indication that she bought the colour. It was in fact reported that Kate picked out beige and brown English handmade fabrics inside.

‘Kate was fascinated by all the designs and picked out two,’ a source told the Daily Star Sunday. ‘She had very definite ideas about what she liked. It was boiling hot outside so the door was open.

‘She was feeling the heat so we sat her 
down with a glass of water. The Duchess was charming and so lovely. She 
didn’t put on any airs or graces. She said she’d got so many ideas after
 coming in.’

The Duchess has one more scheduled official public engagement before she goes on maternity leave, when she names a ship on Thursday in Southampton, Hampshire.

Kate will also attend Trooping the Colour next week to mark the Queen’s birthday - and is debating whether to join William at the Order of the Garter ceremony in Windsor a few days later.

Bernard Thorp, which was founded in 1971, says on its website that its ‘hand screen printed fabrics and wall coverings are of impeccable quality with an ethos of service second to none’.
