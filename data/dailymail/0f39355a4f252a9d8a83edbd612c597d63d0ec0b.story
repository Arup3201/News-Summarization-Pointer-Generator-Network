The city that claims to be 'overwhelmingly united' in its bid for the 2024 Games banned its employees from speaking badly about the Olympics, according to a signed agreement. 

Boston Mayor Martin J Walsh privately signed a deal with the United States Olympic Committee last year that included a section prohibiting city employees from criticizing the Olympics.

The agreement, obtained by the Boston Globe through a public records request, also protects the USOC and the International Olympic Committee from written or spoken criticism.

Watch your mouth: Boston Mayor Martin J Walsh privately signed a deal with the United States Olympic Committee last year that included a section prohibiting city employees from criticizing the Olympics

'I think on its face it’s unconstitutional,' said Sarah Wunsch, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.

'What’s wrong with this decree is that it has no limits,' she added. 'It doesn’t say you have the right, as a citizen, to speak on matters of public concern.'

Speaking about the agreement, Walsh said that no city employees would be punished for speaking their mind about the Olympics outside of work.

'If a city employee isn’t happy and on their own personal time goes to Facebook or Twitter or any other social media, that’s fine,' Walsh said.

Asked why he signed the document, the mayor claimed the clause was 'boilerplate' language and said 'we had to get the agreement signed.'

The New York Times reports that the city's presentation claimed Boston was 'overwhelmingly united in its bid for the 2024 Games,' though a poll conducted for NPR affiliate WBUR spoke otherwise.

Choice: Boston beat out Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington to be the US's entry for a bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games

Big plans: Most structures would be built within a six-mile zone in the city, making much of the Games 'walkable' 

The poll, conducted by The MassINC Polling Group, found only 50 percent supported the Olympics bid outright, with 33 percent opposed. 

75 percent of those polled said they wanted to hold a referendum on the city's bid for hosting the Games, something that Walsh has stated he did not think was necessary. 

Boston beat out Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington to be the US's entry for the 2024 Games. It is not clear whether indecision among the city's residents would imperil the USOC's choice.

Surrounding cities in the Boston area were also cool on the idea of bringing the Olympics, and crowds of fans, to the region.

The City Council in Cambridge, where some events would be staged across the river north of Boston, told officials last month not to devote time or resources to help plan the Games.

Councilman Timothy Toomey, who put forth the measure, labelled the notion of a Boston Olympic Games 'insane.'
