Two years ago, they were nobodies. Jacqui Lambie was a scrappy political candidate. Ricky Muir was a revhead from Gippsland.

But the Palmer United and Motoring Enthusiast senators could fast become 'very, very powerful', political operatives said, if they split from Palmer and set out on their own.

That's exactly what the senators did on Wednesday, when they flexed their muscles, breaking away from PUP by announcing they would vote to stop the government's Future of Financial Advice rules.

Maverick move: PUP-aligned Senators Jacqui Lambie (left) and Ricky Muir (right) today linked up with other crossbenchers and announced they would vote down the government's FOFA laws

Bomb-thrower: Ms Lambie has split with her party in an effort to shut down the Abbott government's Future of Financial Advice law changes

The former Australian Army soldier has been at odds with her colleagues in recent weeks

At a press conference this morning, the two senators announced they would vote to disallow the changes, which water down restrictions on financial advisers.

Going against a deal PUP had previously signed with the government, Lambie and Muir linked up with Labor, the Greens and maverick senators David Leyonhjelm, Bob Day, John Madigan and Nick Xenophon to almost certainly defeat the proposal.

It could be a sign of things to come, thanks to the maths in the Senate. 

Political strategist Glenn Druery told Daily Mail Australia Lambie and Muir could become an influential voting bloc in their own right, particularly as the government needs 39 votes to pass laws, or at least six crossbenchers. 

'If they're smart, Ricky and Jacqui could form their own little alliance,' said political strategist Glenn Druery, known as the 'preference whisperer'.

Mr Druery, who used to work for Muir, said the two senators could bounce between the PUP bloc consisting of Palmer United Party senators Glenn Lazarus and Dio Wang, and the four other crossbenchers. 

'By moving between the Day - Leyonhjlem bloc and the PUP bloc they could put themselves into very strategically important positions.

'If they do team up and become a little bloc on their own, and work with the other power blocs, they are potentially very, very powerful.' 

Clive Palmer this morning demoted the rebellious senator from PUP's senate leadership and barred her from party room meetings following weeks of internal warfare. 

The Tasmanian senator has become a vocal critic of her own party's policies recently, particularly PUP's stance on a pay deal for Australian Defence Force personnel.

Split: Mr Palmer described Ms Lambie's demotion as a 'sad situation' in a radio interview this morning

Explaining her FOFA flip to reporters today, Ms Lambie said: 'Sometimes when you make a wrong, you have to go back in there and make it right. And that's exactly what I'm doing.' 

In an interview with Radio 4BC on Wednesday morning, Mr Palmer described it as a 'sad situation' for Ms Lambie but denied his party was unravelling. 

'Well, we're 100 per cent united. We are united.

'That's just one person, one member out of thousands, who's having a particular problem, who hasn't resigned from our party.' 

He also accused Mr Muir of 'backflipping', saying: 'After he’s got the government to accept all the changes he’s wanted he’s decided to change his mind when it comes to him delivering on that arrangement.'

Palmer United's Glenn Lazarus told reporters he was hoping things would stay together and that Ms Lambie would not leave the party. 

Signs aren't good she will change her mind. Senator Lambie has scrubbed the PUP name and logo from her website. 

And she is not talking to her PUP colleagues, Mr Lazarus said.

'I love Jacqui, I think we get on really well, and the party has achieved quite a number of things throughout the year,' he said.  

'I'm just a bit bewildered about the fact that she won't talk to us.'
