Squeezed in between the gleaming Ferraris, Range Rovers and Aston Martins at Manchester City’s training ground on Friday mornings is a battered two-door VW Golf. It belongs to the Reverend Peter Horlock, the club’s chaplain.

Horlock reportedly is the man who has been holding regular sessions with Mario Balotelli, Manchester City’s volatile Italian striker with a penchant for bust-ups with members of his own team and brawls with his fiery manager, Roberto Mancini.

'I’m there to provide pastoral support and friendship to the players and the staff. Sometimes the players from overseas feel homesick or have problems at home, and need someone to confide in,' says Horlock, 36, who was ordained into the Church of England in 2004  and assumed his role at Manchester City two years ago.

Poor, over-indulged rich kids, you might conclude, but Horlock and the charitable organisation he works for  - Sports Chaplaincy UK – believe that a growing number of players are turning to God, not so much to bring them three points on a Saturday afternoon but to help cope with life in the spotlight.

Fridays is when Horlock puts on his dog collar and heads for Manchester City’s Carrington training base.

Visible on the touchline, in the club canteen and in the offices, he makes himself especially available to players who are injured and need a morale booster, or those who have lost their place in the team and want some reassurance.

'I enjoy getting to know the younger players. They are under a huge amount of pressure and although football operates by its own terms, with lots of money and privileges, when you strip it all down you are still dealing with human beings who need to be heard and supported,' he says.

Horlock does not hold prayer meetings before matches – unlike at Charlton Athletic where the chaplain, the Reverend Matt Baker, gathers together as many as ten players for a 15 minute informal service in a room near the Home dressing room.

He asks for any specific prayer requests, reads a passage from the Bible and then gives a short talk.

'We don’t pray for a result but we do pray that the game will be played in the right spirit, without violence on the pitch or in the stands,' says Baker.

'The overall feeling is that the players want to honour God with their talents.'

Does the Addicks manager Chris Powell ever summon him at half-time to conjure up some divine inspiration?

'Absolutely not – and it’s not my place to lecture the players about their behaviour, but Chris spoke last year at our annual conference and is very supportive. He has a faith himself and sees the importance of what we do.'

Controversial: Mario Balotelli in action. He has had bust-ups with team-mates and his manager

Baker, 44, who happens to be a 
Charlton fan, has been chaplain of the South London club for 12 years. 
His official title at Sports Chaplaincy UK is Pastoral Support Director 
in English Football.

Currently,
66 of the 92 league clubs in England have dedicated chaplains provided 
by the charity, a number that has swelled in recent years with the 
arrival of more and more players from overseas, many of whom seem keen 
to demonstrate their faith by crossing themselves before running on to 
the pitch or kneeling in prayerful thanks after scoring a goal.

Steven Pienaar, the South African born Everton striker, regularly shows off a 'God is great' t-shirt, and Aaron Lennon, the Spurs winger, has played in boots with 'God is love' inscribed on them.

At Chelsea, David Luiz, the Brazilian defender, is in the habit of placing his hands on team-mate Fernando Torres’s head and offering a prayer during the warm-up before games - even though the Almighty seems coy about helping Torres score on a regular basis.

Go back a few years and footballers were reticent to wear their religion on their sleeves – or on their t-shirts for that matter. One of those who did come out as a committed Christian was Linvoy Primus, the ex-Charlton, Reading and Portsmouth player who retired at the end of 2009.

He remembers a time when his team-mate at Portsmouth, Darren Moore, was the butt of jokes for praying and 
reading the Bible before matches.

'When
I became a Christian I could talk to Darren and then the two of us 
would meet up with the chaplain and soon others were showing an interest
and the whole atmosphere changed,' says Primus, who now heads up a 
charity called Football and Faith.

Before long, Primus, Moore and the chaplain had introduced prayer meetings at the club, which still continue today.

'A lot of the younger players came along and were able to talk about things they couldn’t discuss with the manager and coaches,' says Primus.

'Some of them had got caught up in the bright lights and would ask whether they had done something wrong. I would tell them that "yes you may have done something wrong but you are here now and can start again."'

Primus says that when he became a Christian he asked the club chaplain: 'Do I have to be a vicar on the pitch? ' To which the chaplain replied that it was a player’s 'motive' that was important.

'I did not want to lessen my competitive spirit and I still wanted to go in hard when tackling but I think I was more gracious with referees when they made bad decisions.

'I realised that, like me, they were trying to do their best and, like me, they made mistakes. And it helped me deal with defeat better. I still hurt but there was something else going on in my life.

'Football can distort the person you are – all the houses, the fast cars, the lifestyle – but it doesn’t actually mean anything.'

A more traditional role for the likes of chaplains such as Horlock and Baker is spreading the ashes of supporters in their respective club’s Memorial Gardens. Baker conducted 12 ceremonies of that kind last year.

But aren’t they sometimes nauseated by the vast sums of money players earn, often without giving much back to the community?

'The money is not the issue. There are a lot of very selfish poor people just as there are a lot of very selfish rich people,' says Horlock. 'And, actually, many footballers don’t get enough credit for what they do outside the game.

'I’m not twisting arms to get them into the Kingdom but presenting them with a chance to explore faith further when they are ready to do so.'

So, has Balotelli seen the error of his ways? Is repentance in the air?

“I would never discuss anyone’s personal situation. All I would say is that at a club like Manchester City there are a lot of very decent people who don’t share my faith.”
