Manchester United have opened negotiations with David de Gea over a new contract.

The Spaniard's contract expires next summer and he has been linked with a move to Real Madrid.

But the 24-year-old's agent, Jorge Mendes, denied speculation De Gea had agreed a deal to move to the Bernabeu confirmed he has started negotiations with United.

'I am negotiating with Manchester United about De Gea’s renewal,' Mendes told Cadena Ser on Sunday night.

'It is not true that De Gea has found a deal with Real Madrid. I’m negotiating with Manchester United his extension.'

Last week, Mendes also claimed that De Gea was happy to stay at Old Trafford despite the arrival of former Barcelona keeper Víctor Valdes on a free transfer last month.

'He has one year left on his contract and I think that he will stay in Manchester,' Mendes told the BBC. 'The player will decide, but he's happy there, at the moment.'

Louis van Gaal signed De Gea's fellow countryman Victor Valdes on a free transfer in January 

De Gea has been in stunning form for United this season and pulled off a series of brilliant saves to help Louis van Gaal's side rescue a point against West Ham on Sunday.

The Spaniard joined United in 2011 for £17.8million from Atletico Madrid and has grown into a integral part of United's team, with manager Van Gaal admitting he would like him to stay.

When asked about the keeper's future, Van Gaal last week admitted 'everything is possible' but added: 'We would like to keep him.'
