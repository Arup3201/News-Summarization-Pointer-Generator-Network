A record has been set for the most snowfall in a day after a tiny Italian village was dumped with 100 inches in 18 hours - forcing residents to ski between houses and climb out of second-floor windows.

The village of Capracotta, located in central Italy around 125 miles east of Rome, was hit with the polar blast on March 5 in a remarkable blizzard aggravated by powerful wind gusts.

Breaking a 1921 record set in Silver Lake, Colorado, of 76 inches, incredible photos from inside the village show walls of snow carved out from the fronts of doors and shops.

The small village, located east of Rome, received more than 100 inches of snow within 18 hours

The buildup of snow was so fast and furious many residents had to dig their way out of their homes

The clear sky and white snow gave off an eerie blue effect in the village when night fell

Snow remained clinging to the balconies and ledges of buildings following the 18 hour-long blizzard

The snowfall set a world record for the most snow to fall within a single day

Antonio Monaco, the village's mayor, told Italian news agency Ansa: 'It was a spectacle that took our breath away. In some parts of the village the snow was like a long, white wall.

'It was tough but everybody pulled together and made sure that the old people who couldn't leave their houses had the food and medicines that they needed,' The Telegraph reported.

According to weather website Meteoweb, it was just one more record in a 'historic winter for Southern Italy, with numerous incidents of frost and snow'. 

Pictures taken of the village show residents digging through snow that is metres deep and shaking hands from inside the second floor of homes with others standing on the snow piled up outside windows.

Remarkably, the town is not located within the Alps - its susceptibility to massive dumpings of snow lies in its unique geography and location.

Sitting at an altitude of 1,421metres, it is the second-highest district in southern Italy.

It is also close to the sea and sits exposed to cold fronts from the northeast, making it one of the snowiest areas of the world when measured in terms of abundance over short periods of time.

The village lies east of Rome and is not actually located in the Italian Alps. Rather, its altitude and exposure to cold fronts from the northeast are what makes it susceptible to blizzards
