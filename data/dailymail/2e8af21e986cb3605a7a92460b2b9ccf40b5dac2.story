Americans who consider human-linked climate change a load of hogwash and environmentalists kooks have rolled out a new way to express their political views: their exhaust pipes. 

Some truck enthusiasts are reconfiguring their vehicles to produce higher amounts of diesel exhaust in a form of protest dubbed 'rolling coal'. In some cases, they are even adding smokestacks to enhance the effect.

Their aim is to spew thick black clouds of smoke into the air - or at cars - sometimes spending thousands of dollars to do so, according to the Huffington Post. The Rollin' Coal community Facebook page has 15,241 likes.

A community of truck enthusiasts has been posting pictures on social media of their modified vehicles spewing thick clouds of black smoke in a new trend dubbed 'rolling coal'

Some in the community modify their trucks with smokestacks to boost their vehicle's smoke-belching capacity

One modification to their vehicles being used involves increasing the amount of fuel entering the truck's engine. When there's too much fuel, the engine fails to combust properly, turning it into soot. 

'It’s just fun,' said Robbie, a 25-year-old mechanic in South Carolina who has been 'rollin' coal' since he got his first truck 12 years ago, according to Vocativ. 'Just driving and blowing smoke and having a good time.'

The trucks are able to create copious amount of smoke on demand, enabling them to spew it on unsuspecting cars. They call the soot 'Prius repellant'

Coal rollers call that soot 'Prius repellent' and channel it through smokestacks that can release it onto bystanders or cars - especially Priuses - in a thick, pollutant-heavy black cloud, the Post said.

'I run into a lot of people that really don’t like Obama at all,' an unnamed Wisconsin seller of smokestack kits told Slate's David Weigel, explaining some of the rationale behind the movement.

'If he’s into the environment, if he’s into this or that, we’re not,' he continued. 'I hear a lot of that. To get a single stack on my truck - that’s my way of giving them the finger. You want clean air and a tiny carbon footprint? Well, screw you.'

The American Cancer Society has linked exposure to diesel exhaust to a variety of negative health effects, including lung cancer.
