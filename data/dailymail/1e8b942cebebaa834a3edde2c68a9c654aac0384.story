The jihadist brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre, Cherif and Said Kouachi, experienced the trauma of finding their mother’s body after she’d committed suicide when they were 10 and 12 years old, according to a children’s worker.

In the 1990s volunteer Evelyne worked with deprived children in the area of Paris that the brothers lived in and often involved them in activities. She said she adored both boys.

On one occasion she took them to Eurodisney and described how Cherif, the younger of the two, was spell-bound by Mickey Mouse.

She revealed that Said was more reserved and prone to crying.

Cherif was naughtier and occasionally ‘turbulent’, she told eco website Reporterre, according to The Independent. And Said tended to take his lead, despite being older.

Despite Cherif’s troublesome side, Evelyne grew enormously fond of him.

She said: ‘I adored that child. You only had to sweet talk him and take him in your arms and he would calm down. I found him quite touching – under the spell of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, like all children.’

The brothers, who were inseparable, found their mother, who was pregnant at the time with a sixth child, dead in their flat when they came home from school for lunch one day.

Evelyne added: ‘A few months after the trip to Eurodisney Cherif came back from school, accompanied, as ever, by his older brother. They found their mother lying dead in the centre of the flat. Dead from what cause? She had taken too many pills. Most people assumed it was suicide.’

The two brothers were filmed by eyewitnesses in a Paris street after they'd slaughtered several members of the Charlie Hebdo editorial team in cold blood

Both brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre have been buried in unmarked graves.

Cherif Kouachi was interred just before midnight in a cemetery in Gennevilliers, a suburb in north west Paris, a day after his older brother Said was buried in the northeastern city of Reims.

Cherif's family, including his widow, kept away from the funeral and the grave was left anonymous to avoid it becoming a 'pilgrimage site' for Islamists.

The mayor of Gennevilliers, where the younger Kouachi brother lived had not wanted the funeral to go ahead, but said he had no legal means to block it. 

Chérif Kouachi’s widow had asked for both brothers to be buried in the cemetery at Gennevilliers, but the local mayor Patrice Leclerc blocked the request since Saïd, the older brother, was not a resident of the area.

He added: 'I don't want a grave that serves to attract fanatics. I don't want a place that promotes hate.

'He was buried last night, in the most discrete, anonymous way possible.'

But speaking on BFMTV, Mr Robinet said he was forced to allow the burial by the government, which enforced a French law that grants a right to be buried in the town of last residence.

There are no current plans to bury Amedy Coulibaly, who killed five people - including four hostages at a kosher market in Paris - before he was killed by police on January 9.

Two years later, in 1994, the brothers were sent to an orphanage in Correze with a their younger brother and older sister.

While there Cherif developed into a promising footballer and Said was remembered as being ‘civilised and respectful’, according to a former classmate, ‘Cedric’.

He told website Modiapart and Swiss newspaper Le Matin: ‘The Kouachi brothers were "respected", because they could "handle themselves".Cherif was very good with his fists but, above all, he was a bit of a lad. He was a fan of [the comedian and actor] Djamel Debbouze and football... He was funny and regarded himself as a good looker. He was a fantastic dancer at 15 and played football as easily as he breathed. He could have made a career of it.’

But he added that the school was very violent, with some teachers plainly scared of the children. He remains convinced that the Charlie Hebdo massacre, which saw several members of the magazine murdered, along with two policeman – and the brothers die in a shootout with police at the ages of 32 and 34 - would never have happened if they’d be supported more.

‘They must have been brainwashed,’ he said.

The brothers are thought to have been trained by Al Qaeda in Yemen - and carried out the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine to 'avenge the Prophet'. 

The magazine was famous for poking fun at Islam, along with other religions. 

Cherif Kouachi was buried in an unmarked grave in Gennevilliers, a suburb in north-west Paris, on Saturday night, a day after his older brother, Said, was buried in the northeastern city of Reims.

Cherif's family, including his widow, kept away from the funeral and the grave was left anonymous to avoid it becoming a 'pilgrimage site' for Islamists.

The mayor of Gennevilliers, where the younger Kouachi brother lived had not wanted the funeral to go ahead, but said he had no legal means to block it.
