Bike thieves stole a state-of-the art electric bike - and then unwittingly called the owner to help re-charge it.

Ben Jaconelli’s £2,500 Go Cycle was stolen when he left it securely locked on Kingsland Road in Hackney.

Mr Jaconelli, who runs e-bike online store Fullycharged.com, had only left the bike unattended for 20 minutes.

But after reporting the theft to police and fearing he would not see his possession again, he received a phone call from a suspicious man asking for a charger for a Go Cycle.

He then managed to track down the caller - and paid him a visit in a 1970s army truck with three of his friends.

Mr Jaconelli, of Hackney, who has just opened a Fully Charged shop at Old Street roundabout, East London, said: 'I’m the authorised dealer for Go Cycle’s in the area so the thief called me, unaware that it was my bike.

'He asked for a charger for a Go Cycle and I knew straight away it had to be the thief.'

The 30-year-old and his friends then used the internet to track down their man, before putting a plan in place to pay him a visit.

Fearing there may be trouble, he asked three of his friends to come with him.

They all climbed into a colleague's former army truck, a 1970s Military Land Rover 101, in a bid to beef up their presence.

When they arrived at the address, in Whitechapel, London, the mystery caller was not in - but his mother was at home and called her son demanding answers.

'I took down as many details for him as possible and then set about tracking him down,' he said.

'One of the guys at our warehouse has an old army truck so we piled in to that and turned up at his house.

'He was out, but his bemused mother was in and she got straight on the phone to her son to demand to know why he wanted an electric bike charger.

The mystery caller was asking for a charger for a Go Cycle electric bike. Ben Jaconelli took down all his details while he was on the telephone and then went about tracking the suspected thief down

'A minute later he called me and asked why I was at his house and I said "you stole my bike".

'He hung up and 20 minutes later the bike arrived at the warehouse in a taxi.'

The details have been passed on to police who are now investigating the theft and possible links to other missing bikes in the east London area.

Mr Jaconelli added: 'There is a such a close network of dealers and I had alerted them all to the theft.

'Even if he did not ring me, I would have found out about it pretty quickly.'

Police confirmed the matter had been investigated and so far no arrests had been made.
