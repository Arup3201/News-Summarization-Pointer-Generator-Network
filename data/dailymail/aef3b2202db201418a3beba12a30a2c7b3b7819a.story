Communities Secretary Eric Pickles hoped the offer of a 'compromise' on his planning reforms would avert a rebellion among Tory and Lib Dem MPS

Homeowners will keep the right to complain about neighbours’ plans for large extensions, the Government signalled yesterday.

The move is a major climbdown after David Cameron last year promised ‘fast-track’ applications to kick-start the economy through building.

Property-owners were to be given the right to extend as far as 26ft without planning permission or opposition from adjacent families, but Conservative and Liberal Democrat backbenchers warned it would pit ‘neighbour against neighbour’.

A revised scheme means homeowners will still have to notify their local council, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said last night.

He promised to tackle the issue ‘head-on’ in a letter to all Tory and Lib Dem MPs last night.

‘We are seeking to deliver practical reforms to the planning system to help families improve their home, and to remove excessive red tape on uncontentious, small-scale extensions,’ he added.

‘We will seek to move ahead  with these new permitted householder development rights, but introduce a new light-touch neighbours’ consultation scheme.

‘I hope this shows that we have listened constructively and made a targeted and common sense improvement.’

Under the revised scheme, local authorities will notify neighbours of any applications and approve them if there are no objections made within 21 days.

Councils will decide any contested cases, with the most difficult developments being decided at a full council planning committee.

Mr Pickles said the new system would mean ‘uncontroversial improvements are fast-tracked’ but it also ‘builds consensus’ by encouraging homeowners to talk informally to their neighbours in advance.

‘Neighbours’ amenity is protected, with the council and councillors acting as independent arbiters,’ he added.

The move also makes it cheaper and easier to extend by removing the need to buy planning documents and shifts power from the state to taxpayers, said Mr Pickles.

‘We now have a set of reforms that will both help local traders and the wider economy. We are backing families who work hard, want to get on and improve their homes,’ he said.

‘We are strengthening individuals’ property rights and supporting aspiration and home ownership.’

Under the government's reforms, the size of single-storey extensions which can be built without planning permission would double to up to 8metres

Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who opposed the original plans, said: ‘I think essentially the Government has moved quite a distance to address the specific concerns some of us had.

'For us a red line was that the neighbour’s right to object should be kept in place. I think people understand that the unfettered free-for-all that was originally proposed is not acceptable.

‘The Government’s proposals are not perfect but they have shown that they have listened and taken on board our legitimate concerns. Most MPs will be able to back these new proposals.’

Councillor Mike Jones, chairman of the Local Government Association’s environment and housing board, said: ‘Councils have been calling for the right of neighbours to have a say to be protected, and we are pleased that government is listening.

‘However, there are serious questions to be answered as to how this new separate scheme will work in practice.

'The Government needs to clarify how this new scheme, which will require a planning department to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources, will be paid for at a time when local authorities are already facing significant cuts to their budgets.’

A Government source said it had been ludicrous to suggest that  Mr Pickles’ original ideas would have contributed to growth.

‘They overstated the problem in terms of the way the planning system normally works. Ninety per cent of applications are approved.’

At the moment, homeowners can avoid seeking planning permission for a single-storey addition of no more than 10ft at a terraced property, or one of 13ft at a detached house.

The Government wanted to double those figures for a three-year period, as long as the extensions did not take up more than half of a garden.

Now, however, only uncontested applications will be allowed to proceed without permission.

The Government says it still expects 40,000 extensions a year to be built under the new fast-track system.
