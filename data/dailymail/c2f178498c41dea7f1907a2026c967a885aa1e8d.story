Darrell Simester, 44, was found living in squalid living conditions with torn clothes at a farm near Newport

A 'vulnerable' missing man was kept like a slave and forced to work 15-hour days with no pay for 13 years, a trial has heard.

Darrell Simester, 44, was found living in squalid living conditions at Cariad Farm, near Newport, with teeth missing and burns on his legs.

He slept in a rat-infested shed and was allegedly told he would be buried with the horses if he tried to escape, Cardiff Crown Court heard.

Daniel Doran, 67, and his son David Dan Doran, 42, denied a charge of requiring Mr Simester to perform compulsory labour between April 2010 and March 2013.

Mr Simester disappeared after arguing with friends on a holiday in the south Wales resort of Porthcawl in 2000.

A jury heard the 44-year-old regularly washed himself in an animal's feeding trough and used a broken outdoor toilet that would only flush with a bucket of water and a stick.

Prosecuting counsel John Hipkin QC said when Mr Simester was eventually tracked down by his worried family from Kidderminster they found him in a 'horrific state' and virtually unrecognisable.

Doctors later found him in poor health - with a large and painful hernia protruding from his groin and scrotum, cystic swelling to his back, burns to his legs and callouses on his feet. 

Mr Hipkin said: 'His brother Duncan walked through the farm gate - he saw a man shovelling manure into a wheel barrow.

'Duncan approached him and after a little time recognised it was his brother. He was in a bad physical condition.

'He was hunched over and wearing ripped clothes and shoes. Darrell Simester for his own part didn't recognise his own brother and looked scared.

'His father when he saw him described him as being in a horrific state, hunched over and barely able to walk. He was filthy.'

He said there was little doubt that Mr Simester was kept against his will.

'Darrell Simester was a man of timid disposition who for 13 years was forced to work against his will and under menace,' said Mr Hipkin.

'A local police officer who entered his caravan said it looked as if it had been simply left to rot... and considered it to be unfit for human habitation.

'While accommodated in the shed... He was not provided with any bedding or covers and would place his jacket that he had worked in covered in manure over him to keep him warm.

'The toilet which Darrell used was broken and did not flush. He had to use a stick to get rid of his excreta.

'Darrell Simester regarded the defendants as his bosses. He worked (virtually) every day for 13 years.

Daniel Doran, 67, and his son David Dan Doran, 42, denied a charge of requiring Mr Simester to perform compulsory labour at Cardiff Crown Court

'His working day would start at 7am and and he would finish between 9pm and 10pm. He did not receive any pay at all.

'You (the jury) will have to decide whether Mr Simester remained at the farm as a volunteer because he preferred life there, or whether he was coerced to stay while under some form of threat.'

Mr Simester told officers he had tried to leave on two occasions - once after a spade had been thrown at him - but he had been caught and taken back to the farm by David Doran. 

'Darrell was told he would be buried out the back where the horses who had been shot were buried', said Mr Simester.

His parents Tony Simester, 66, and Jean, 61, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, contacted the police around 50 times but were never able to locate their son.

But after years of searching, they finally tracked him down in the remote farm in south Wales following an anonymous tip-off.

Police raided the farm and took Darrell away for medical treatment.

He was suffering with a large and painful hernia protruding from his groin and scrotum, cystic swelling to his back, burns to his legs, a fungal infection and callouses on his feet and terrible teeth. 

The family said Darrell had been to the hospital several times since he came home and had undergone an operation.

His father said his problems were 'all down to the conditions he has been subjected to over the last 13 years', but his mother confirmed he was 'getting stronger and coping very well'.
