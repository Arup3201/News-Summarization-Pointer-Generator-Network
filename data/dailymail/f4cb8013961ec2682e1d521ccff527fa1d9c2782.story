Former policewoman Nicola Coe, 
eight months pregnant with her fifth child, falsely claimed nearly £9,000 in housing and council tax benefits while she was on long term paid sick leave

A policewoman fiddled nearly £9,000 in housing and council tax benefits while she was on long term paid sick leave.

Nicola Coe, 39, admitted dishonestly claiming the cash when she was signed off work from Suffolk Police and had her wages slashed.

The disgraced officer, who is eight months pregnant with her fifth child, quit the force after it launched a disciplinary hearing into her conduct.

Coe, of Ipswich, was given a 12-month community order yesterday after she admitted three charges relating to falsely claiming housing and council tax concessions.

Two other similar charges were not pursued as the benefits cheat appeared at South East Suffolk magistrates court, Ipswich.

Mandy Ford, prosecuting for Ipswich Borough Council, said Coe first claimed benefits on July 9, 2009.

She was living in a rented home in the town at the time under her maiden name, along with three dependent children.

Coe was given cash support because she was a long-term sick absentee from Suffolk Police and her income had been cut, magistrates heard.

But the crook failed to declare on her application form that she was being paid through a police officers' insurance scheme.

As a result the mother-of-four was not entitled to concessions for housing or council tax.

If the council had known Coe was receiving insurance money it would not have given her the benefits, the court heard.

She then also dishonestly completed another claim form, on February 2, 2010, despite still receiving insurance payments.

Coe also made a claim backdated to November 19, 2009.

Her scam was only finally exposed when council staff contacted police to check her payment records.

The shamed officer  - who pocketed about £8,800 altogether - has just started paying her ill-gotten gains back at £15-£20 a week.

John Hughes, defending, said the police cuts salaries by half when an officer has been off ill for six months, and the force stops payments entirely after a year.

Mr Hughes said: 'She had significant ill-heath and admissions to Addenbrooke's Hospital.

'In 2009 Mrs Coe had serious problems and was in and out of Addenbrooke's five times in the preceding year.

'She was in a lot of difficulties with ill health and three dependent children.'

He said Coe, who had been based at Martlesham police headquarters, thought she had told the council of her insurance payments when she made her claims.

As well as her 12-month supervised community order, she was ordered to pay £150 costs.

Police spokesman Richard Jones said: 'Suffolk Police can confirm that the Professional Standards Department was contacted by Ipswich Borough Council in October 2011 in relation to a serving police officer who had allegedly committed offences under the Fraud Act.'
