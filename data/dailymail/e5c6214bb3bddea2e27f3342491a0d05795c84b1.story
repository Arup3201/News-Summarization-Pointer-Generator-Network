More money: Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured with his wife Sally), who has backed pay rises for MPs, has taken a 1 per cent pay hike

MPs are in line for a dramatic salary rise of up to £20,000 in a move likely to reignite public fury over their pay and perks.

They could take home up to £80,000 a year – more than three times the national average – under new recommendations.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which reports next month, has been looking at an increase of between £10,000 and £20,000.

But the lower figure is considered more likely to try and minimise the public backlash, which would take MPs' pay, currently £65,738, up to £75,000.

It comes as the Commons Speaker John Bercow, who has backed pay rises for MPs, has taken a 1 per cent pay hike taking his pay just above the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary.

The hike, which will probably be delayed until after 2015, will be partly offset by curbs to their gold-plated pensions and personal expenses.

Ipsa, which was handed responsibility for MPs’ salaries and pensions two years ago in the wake of the expense scandal, has been carrying out a long review of MPs salaries.

Its members believe salaries should be raised to bring politicians in line with senior civil servants and other professions.

Mr Bercow said in 2009 that they should earn as much as a GP or a council boss, many of whom take home more than £100,000, as their jobs had ‘equal breadth, scope and contact with the public.’

He has recently taken a swipe at David Cameron, saying party leaders should not block pay rises to ‘appease the public’ and it was unfair on those politicians who are not independently wealthy.

One senior MP told a newspaper yesterday he feared MPs would be ‘accused of having their snouts in the trough’. But he argued: ‘Voters may not like it, but if you pay peanuts you get monkeys.’

Taking the lead: Cabinet ministers including David Cameron are in a five-year pay freeze, saving the taxpayer £3million

But Labour MP John Mann, who opposes pay rises for MPs said: ‘They should throw this proposal in the bin, it will just create more bad publicity for MPs. It would be completely unacceptable, we are in the middle of a recession.’

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Politicians shouldn't get huge pay hikes when taxpayers and other public sector workers are facing pay freezes and cuts.

‘MPs are already very well paid, and have other perks like gold-plated pensions that most taxpayers could never afford for themselves.

'There can't be one rule for MPs and another for the rest of the country. If politicians accept this rise it will send out completely the wrong message about pay restraint from the heart of Westminster.’

Ipsa is likely to demand that MPs give up their guaranteed pensions and switch to a less generous scheme.

If so, most if not all of the pay rise, 
will be needed to match their current pension deal, which is more 
generous than for most of the public sector because MPs pay in for fewer
years before drawing a full pension and get a much larger contribution 
from the taxpayer.

Downing Street, which has no input into Ipsa’s proposals, is likely to be alarmed by the effect of the pay rise on their ‘all in this together’ message and the squeeze on public sector pay.

Cabinet ministers including Mr Cameron are in a five-year pay freeze, saving the taxpayer £3million.

None of the party leaders will be keen to annoy their backbenchers by breaking ranks and opposing, and it is understood they will discuss how to how to handle the potentially toxic announcement.

In a recent consultation, a third of MPs told Ipsa they thought they pay should go up to £86,000 with some demanding more than £100,000.

MPs pay has been frozen for two years but will rise by 1 per cent this year and next.

Mr Bercow, MP for Buckingham has accepted the rise, taking his £142,162 deal up by £664, more than the Prime Minister and £8,000 more than a cabinet minister.
