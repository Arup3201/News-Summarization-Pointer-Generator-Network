The book is a guide for British soldiers with how to deal with the German civilian population 

Their women are not to be trusted, they struggle to control their feelings and can fly into a rage if things go wrong. 

However, they are also make excellent sausages and their beer is 'one of the pleasantest in Europe'.

These are among the official observations made of Germans for British soldiers preparing to oversee the generation that served Hitler.

They appear in the 1944 manual, Instructions for British Servicemen in Germany, that has surprisingly risen to fourth place in the German bestseller list. 

The book is full of warnings for British soldiers in Germany and explains: 'There are signs that the German leaders are already making plans for a third World War. That must be prevented at all costs.'

Intended to condition a conscript army to resist German propaganda, the little red book also covers general cultural topics such as food and drink and social customs.

The portraits of Germans in the book are mostly unflattering. However, it does comment on the high quality of German sausages, coffee and beer.

It warns British soldiers that: 'The Germans are not good at controlling their feelings. They have a streak of hysteria. 

'You will find that Germans may often fly into a passion if some little thing goes wrong.'

It urges British soldiers to give orders in a 'firm, military manner' as the German civilian is 'used to it and expects it'.

It adds: 'It is important that you should be smart and soldierly in appearance and behaviour. The Germans think nothing of a slovenly soldier.'

The book is full of warnings and advice for British soldiers in Germany.

There is a strong emphasis on appearance and the need to look smart. 

One passage says: 'The Germans adore military show. It's important that you should be smart and soldierly in appearance as the Germans think nothing of a slovenly soldier.' 

On Hitler, it remarks: 'Hitler's aim was to terrorise the German people so that no one would dare resist him by deed or word.

'Woven into Hitler's doctrine are many deep-seated German "complexes", such as hatred of the Jews, a desire to domineer over others and a readiness to believe that they themselves are being persecuted.'

In the passage on the condition of the German people it warns 'you will find a war area of bleak poverty and devastation. During the war, their rations have been a good deal lower than ours and they have had much less meat, bread and milk and the quality of the food was inferior.'  

Commenting on German culture, it says: 'Germans don't know how to make tea, but they are quite expert with coffee.'

On alcohol it says: 'Whiskey and gin will be scarce and of poor quality but there are many kinds of spirits called Schnaps. The cheaper sorts are guaranteed to take the skin off one's throat. Go easy on Schnaps.'

In a passage on sport, it says: 'Football is the most popular game but is played less vigorously than in Britain. Charging is regarded as foul play.'  

British soldiers are also told to take caution when mingling with 'attractive' German women.

It says: 'Don't be too ready to listen to stories told by attractive women. They may be acting under orders.'   

In the section called 'What the Germans are like?' it explains that the Germans are bigger and fleshier. 

'There are fewer of the wiry type and more big, fleshy, fair-haired men and women, especially in the north.' 

In the section called 'What the Germans think of us', it says they 'admire the British' and that 'even Hitler had a grudging respect for us'. In particular, it says they admire the British national values of 'imagination, enterprise and tough endurance.'

Not surprisingly perhaps, the book was concerned that some soldiers 'may be tempted to feel sorry' for the Germans and stated: 'There will be no brutality about a British occupation, but neither will there be softness of sentimentality. 

The book, originating from the Ministry of War, was re-released in English some years ago as a novelty and picked up by a German publisher Helge Malchow. 

Following a post-war gap in the collective consciousness, where the younger generation's interest was blocked by their elders' shame about what had happened, Germans are now more interested than at any other time. 

Last year saw more than 2,000 books on Hitler, the Nazis and the war published in Germany, while visits to sites of the Third Reich continue to rise. 

Hitler's tea-house on top of a mountain in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, is now the 20th-biggest tourist pull in the country.
