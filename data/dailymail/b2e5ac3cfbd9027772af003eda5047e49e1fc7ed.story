Chelsea crashed out of Europe, beaten on away goals by 10-man Paris Saint-Germain and branded 'babies' by Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Jose Mourinho's team led twice in this turbulent encounter but twice allowed PSG to level, with captain Thiago Silva heading the vital second, six minutes from the end of extra-time.

Ibrahimovic, dismissed for a tackle on Oscar in the first-half, said: 'I don't know if I have to get angry or start to laugh. For me when I saw the red card I was like "the guy doesn't know what he's doing".

'That is not the worst. The worst is when I got the red card all the Chelsea players come around. It felt like I had a lot of babies around me.'

Mourinho said he hoped the red card could be overturned but also bemoaned a penalty not given for a trip on Diego Costa and what he thought might be an elbow on Costa by David Luiz.

The Chelsea manager also blamed his own players for failing to deal with their numerical advantage, wilting under expectations and conceding twice from set-pieces.

'When a team cannot defend two corners a team doesn't deserve to win,' said Mourinho. 'We couldn't cope with the pressure. For them it was easy, two lines of four, counter-attack, waiting for the right moment. Mentally for them with 10 there is nothing to lose.

'Our performance was not good enough. The opponent was stronger than us, they coped better with the pressure of the game. Because they had 10 men we felt more the pressure of winning and they had nothing to lose.

'We couldn't cope with that, we conceded two goals in two set pieces. That is difficult to accept. For me it was a surprise. I am disappointed, but I try always to be pragmatic and honest. The first feeling was that we deserved to lose. We didn't deserve to go through.

'It's not the moment to explain. We will analyse it. We need to react. We have a Premier League to win. I told that to the players. We lost a competition where even if we win today there are other big teams to beat.

'We have the Premier League to win and we are in a good situation. There's no time to cry. Move on, and look forward.'

On Ibrahimovic's red card, Mourinho said: 'I spoke to him after the game and when he speaks with me he's always honest. He would tell me if it was a reason for a red card, and he was very disappointed so if that's the case, I hope they can minimise the mistake and let him play the quarter-final. If he did nothing wrong, he deserves that.

'But the other situations, it was a clear penalty on Diego Costa and, once more, I think it's a waste of time and money to have the officials on the side of the goal. If he cannot see a penalty 10 metres when it's completely clear, it's a waste of time and money.

'The David elbow I didn't see, I confess. But when UEFA give him the man of the match, I have to believe there's no elbow. Perhaps they cannot give us the penalty but maybe they can do what is fair and suspend David and take Ibra into the quarter-finals.' 

Ibrahimovic also suggested Oscar feigned injury.

'I pulled out (of the tackle), because I saw him come in the tackle.

'I don't know if he was acting afterwards. Doesn't matter. We won the game, we went through and let's see what happens.'

It was ill-tempered with Sky Sports pundits Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness very critical of the behaviour by Mourinho's players, especially their attempts to get Ibrahimovic sent off. Carragher called it 'disgraceful' and Souness called it 'pathetic'.

Luiz equalised for PSG in the 86th minute, to take the game into extra time after Gary Cahill had volleyed Chelsea ahead. Eden Hazard restored the lead with a penalty in extra-time, after handball by Thiago Silva, who then headed in the winner with six minutes of extra-time left.

'It is amazing for everyone, amazing for Paris the club, for Paris the city,' said Luiz, who left Stamford Bridge for the French capital last year. 'My cycle was finished at Chelsea and PSG gave me a great opportunity to continue my career.

'I was very happy at Chelsea, I respect everyone and it was good to score. I said I wouldn't celebrate but I couldn't control my emotions. Thank you to Chelsea, and sorry I celebrated because I was so emotional.'

The Barclays Premier League will be without a team in the last eight of the Champions League for the second time in three years if Arsenal and Manchester City cannot overturn first-leg deficits next week against Monaco and Barcelona respectively but PSG boss Laurent Blanc was satisfied to make it into the quarter-finals after this fierce contest.

‘Both sides put pressure on the opposition and Chelsea did their fair share of that. It had happened even before the match with their manager exerting pressure on the referee. That’s part of the mind games. But if you take out these elements of unsporting behaviour, I think my team were better than Chelsea in every area of the pitch,’ he said.
