Estée Lauder Creative Director Donald Robertson, who moonlights as the popular Instagram artist Donald Drawbertson, has painted the fashion industry's most notable faces onto walnuts for his nutty project inspired by the holiday snack.  

The 53-year-old fashion illustrator and father of five from Larchmont, New York, has cleverly rendered portraits of Anna Wintour, Karl Lagerfeld, Coco Chanel, Kanye West, Grace Coddington and more onto the shells of walnuts for his aptly-titled new book Fashion is Nuts.

'Whether it's Edie Campbell dressed in nothing but body paint and a headdress, or Iris Apfel sitting front row wearing her signature glasses and dressed in red fur, fashion is, and has always been wondrously mad,' he explained on his website.

Top dog: Instagram artist Donald Robertson painted Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour's face onto a walnut for his new book Fashion is Nuts, in which her portrait is labeled as 'Alpha nut'

Suited up: The 53-year-old used walnuts, paint and duct tape to make his unique creations. In his book, Mr Robertson described designer Karl Laferfeld as an 'Uber nut'

The 40-page collection of portraits celebrating the crazed fashion industry and its most creative stars retails for $40 and was released last Wednesday, with a limited print run of only 1,000 copies.

Mr Robertson used walnuts, paint and duct tape to create his fabulous figures, which were later photographed by Henry Leutwyler.

In addition to his book, the artist released $60 posters of individual 'nuts', including Hedi Slimane, Yves Saint Laurent, Pharrell Williams, and Riccardo Tisci.

Mr Robertson told Yahoo that he came up with the concept while staring at a bowl of walnuts that were left over from Christmas. 

He explained: 'I thought: "Those kind of look like heads." The next thing you know, I was down in the basement painting all of them and I thought: "These are kind of cool!" And then I started to post them, and oh my god, people went crazy.'

Double threat: Mr Roberton's rendering of rapper-turned-designer Kanye West is captioned, 'I AM A NUT'

Vibrant color: The fashion illustrator used orange duct tape to depict Vogue creative director Grace Coddington's fiery red hair

French fashion: Legendary designer Coco Chanel was imagined wearing her trademark bouclé jacket and smoking a cigarette 

And the project took off from there. 

'The insane thing about Instagram [is that] you can do this crazy art project with your friends, and then the next thing you know, Sarah [Andelman] from Colette sees it and wants to collaborate,' he said. 'This is the world we live in right now.'

The craziness of the situation inspired the hashtag 'fashion is nuts', which later became the title of his art book. 

When Paper magazine asked Mr Robertson if anyone was insulted by his nutty creations, he explained that he was only worried about rendering Pat MacGrath's portrait because her 'skin is so smooth'.

'I searched for the smoothest walnut I could find,' he told the outlet. 'She just flipgrammed the whole book to her hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram yesterday. So I'm good.'

He added: 'Ali [Niroomand], the manager at Sant Ambroeus showed Grace Coddington hers. She laughed, I'm told.'
