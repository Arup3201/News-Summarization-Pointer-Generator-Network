Martina Navratilova surprised partner Julia Lemigova by proposing to her during the US Open on Saturday.

After Kei Nishikori's stunning win over world number one Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals, Navratilova appeared on the big screen on Arthur Ashe Stadium to pop the question.

Navratilova, 57, said: 'I have been waiting for the right time to ask Julia to marry me. I thought this was the right place and the right time to pop the question and thankfully I got a 'yes'.'
