They served in three wars, became known as Flying Fortresses because of their awesome fire-power, and during the Second World War they dropped more bombs than all other US army aircraft combined.

Packed with high-explosives and bristling with heavy machine guns, the B-17 bomber earned a rightful reputation as a fearsome weapon of war.

Today, however, there are only 14 aircraft still able to take to the skies, perhaps the most famous of which is the Movie Memphis Belle.

Originally known as Memphis Belle, and later renamed after the 1990 film of her exploits, she was not only the first aircraft to complete her 25-mission tour-of-duty without being shot down, but she did so without losing a single member of her crew.

All ten men who served aboard the aircraft escaped the war with little more than a scratch, a miracle in a profession famed for the short life-span of its members, and despite the Belle often returning to base with her engines shot out and riddled with bullet holes.

Now the Belle has taken to the skies once again, complete with a crew of World War Two veterans who served aboard other B-17s during the conflict.

The Movie Memphis Belle is perhaps the most famous of all B-17 bombers, as she was the first to complete her tour-of-duty without being shot down

Not only did the aircraft survive her time in combat, so did all ten members of her crew which is a miraculous feat considering the famed short life-spans of pilots during the Second World War

During the War nearly 1,000 B-17s could be sortied at any one time, but just 14 remain in flying condition today, including the Memphis Belle. Here the aircraft is pictured with veteran aviators Henry Hughey (left), Hap Chandler (centre) and Al McMahan (right)

Al McMahan, 92, who also completed 25 missions as a tail gunner and ball-turret gunner in a different B-17, takes a flight on The Movie Memphis Belle

Mr McMahan described the experience as 'wonderful' saying the reliable aircraft had saved his life on two occasions, on both his first and last sortie

While the four-engine design of the B-17 may be outdated by today's standards, its huge bulk bristling with high-powered machine guns still cuts an imposing figure

For $450 the Liberty Foundation, which is now in charge of the Belle, is offering flights on board the bomber starting at DeKalb-Peachtree Airport, Atlanta, before stopping in Shreveport, LA, San Antonio, Texas and other locations across the US

Survivors: All ten of the Memphis Belle's crew members survived the war and are commemorated in a picture mounted in the old radio room of the aircraft

The Norden bombsite inside the front turret of the Flying Fortress was so secret during the War that crew members had to destroy the device if the plane crashed, to keep the technology from the hands of the enemy

Originally named the Memphis Belle, the plane was renamed after the 1990 film of her exploits as The Movie Memphis Belle. Here pilot Ray Fowler holds a preflight briefing with veterans and enthusiasts

While B-17s are most famous for their role in the Second World War, they were also used by the US military in Korea and Vietnam

Scars of battle: Here the controls of the aircraft show the effects of nearly 70 years of use. In total 12,000 B-17s were produced during the Second World War, with more than 4,500 lost in combat
