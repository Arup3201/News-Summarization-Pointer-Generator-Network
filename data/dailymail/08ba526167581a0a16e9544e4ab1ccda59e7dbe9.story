As we speak, Beyonce, Rita Ora and The Saturdays are dusting off their wellies and pulling on their hotpants.

Why? Because one of the biggest music extravaganzas in the summer calender kicks off tomorrow.

Yes, party people, Virgin Media's V festival starts here. Headliners Beyonce and Kings of Leon have drawn a massive and diverse crowd, while Rita Ora, Calvin Harris, Of Monsters And Men and The Saturdays will ensure everyone from the pop princesses to the indie crew are catered for.

But looking glamorous at a festival isn't always easy.

As any tent-dwelling fashionista knows, the uncertain British weather (yes, there are a few drops of rain forecast for this weekend) can 
wreak havoc when it comes to exuding the festival chic the A-list seem to get so right (curse them and their winnebagos).

Steal their look: Beyonce and Rita Ora will be performing at this weekend's V Festival and FEMAIL have called in MAC and Very.co.uk to share their top tips for festival style and beauty

Party time: The main stage at Hylands Park, the Essex venue for the two day festival

But help is at hand because FEMAIL have 
called in the make-up maestros at MAC and the style supremos at 
Very.co.uk to give their top tips on how to give the likes of Beyonce, 
Jessie J and Ellie Goulding a run for their money in the glamour stakes 
this weekend.

The make-up gurus at MAC are this weekend's official make-up sponsor and, as well as being on hand to make up the likes of Beyonce and Rita Ora before their performances, the team will be in the Virgin Media Louder Lounge to make-over the likes of Jessie Ware and the Made In Chelsea cast, as well as festival goers looking for a dash more glamour.

Festivals are the perfect opportunity to push the boundaries when it comes to make-up: think lashings of glitter, smoky eyes, vampy lips and neon.

Then there's that age-old issue of making the make-up work for day to night - and last the distance. MAC senior artist Cher Webb has some top tips.

'Keep a bright matte lipstick at hand to dramatically change your make-up from day to night.

'Something that will last throughout the festival fun is always a winner.

All that glitters: From glitzy eyes to hot pink cheek and rouge lips, the MAC senior artists have shared their festival looks - will Beyonce be opting for one of these for her performance?

'Try MAC Ruby Woo lipstick in classic red, £15 for the perfect velvet pout that is unmissable and 100% kissable.'

As for flawless skin that will last through to the early hours, the team suggest using a minimal amount of products on the skin but achieving the coverage from a very long lasting corrector, like MAC Pro Longwear Concealer.

If you can't make the festival, then each make-up artist has also provided a useful step-by-step guide to getting the look at home.

Something for everyone: MAC will be on hand to offer their make-up wizardry to the stars performing and anyone passing by the Virgin Media Louder Lounge, which look will you opt for?

Step by Step:

1) Start by prepping the skin with Prep + Prime SPF50 to fully protect and revitalise skin leaving it smooth and perfected.

2) Smooth and buff Pro Longwear Foundation onto the face with a #191 Brush. Add a touch of Pro Longwear Concealer to any blemishes, and under the eye, to lift and brighten the area. Add Powder Blush in Margin to the cheek area to add instant warm radiance.

3) For the eyes, use Boot Black 
Liquid Eyeliner to create a sleek black line and flick on the top lash 
line. Use the tip of the wand to create soft dots of all sizes all over 
the eyelid and around the liner. Follow the shape as you go and also 
take the dot effect under the eye line.

4)
Take a #219 Brush and add Pro Reflex Glitter in Antiqued Gold in small 
dots sparingly over dotty areas. This eye makeup looks at its best when 
it has been created with a free hand and not applied too perfectly.

5) Curl lashes and add a generous amount of Haute & Naughty Lash Mascara. Compliment the eye with #7 Lashes.

6) Groom brows with an eyebrow pencil to groom and define.

7)
Apply Prep + Prime Lip to hydrate and nourish lips. Smooth Retro Matte 
Lipstick in Relentlessly Red all over your lips then add a touch of 
Retro Matte lipstick in Dangerous to the centre, to create a soft 
two-tone effect.

8) Finish the look with a touch of Bronzer in Matte Bronze to the contours of the face naturally

festivals in this country has really changed since I first started 
going. It’s no longer about rolling around in the mud and not washing 
for days, the fashion is now almost as important as the music itself.
