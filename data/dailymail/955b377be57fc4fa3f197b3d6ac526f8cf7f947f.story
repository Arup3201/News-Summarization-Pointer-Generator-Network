Just six months ago, this little fellow was found hungry, destitute and unable to see.

Basil the blind dog was picked up by rescuers who noticed he could not walk five yards without bumping into something.

Now, thanks to an innovative new gadget from America, Basil has been given a new lease of life – and his carers hope they will now be able to find a family to permanently house him.

Basil, a four-year-old Collie cross, was found abandoned and blind six months ago but is now able to walk around again thanks to a 'halo' he wears around his head

The thin metal loop is worn around his head attached to a cushion that puts pressure on his shoulders when it hits something, signalling for him to stop before hitting something

Basil is the first dog in the UK to use the device after a US distributor learned of his plight and sent one over

The four-year-old Corgi cross has been given a special guard to wear around his head, which manufacturers call the ‘Muffin’s Halo’.

The light-weight tubular metal ring stops Basil from bumping into objects, allowing him to run around freely without bruising himself.

It is attached to his body with a harness and a pillow, which is fashioned to look like angel wings.

The ‘halo’ is designed to be slightly longer and wider than the wearer and when it touches an object, it puts pressure on Basil's shoulders, teaching him to turn away.

His foster family say he is the first dog in the UK to pioneer the device, after a UK distributor learned of his plight and sent it over as a free gift.

Prison officer Helena Webster, 25, who has been looking after him, said: ‘When we first took Basil in, he was running into things all the time.

'He kept bruising his face and shoulders because he just couldn’t see what he was doing.

‘Now he wears the halo, he’s a lot more confident. He can play outside just like other dogs which is great.

Workers at West Yorkshire Dog Rescue hope that with his new headgear, a family will come forward to adopt Basil, who was found wandering the streets of Leeds

When resue workers first found Basil, he was unable to run a few feet without bumping into something and bruising his head and face. Now his halo tells him when he is about to hit something

Vets still cannot say how Basil became blind, but think his owners abandoned him because of the condition

‘He’s
 a really happy, lovable dog. He loves being cuddled and playing 
football. He’s got a great personality and he’s really become part of 
the family.

‘I’ll be sad to see him go but we hope he’ll find a new loving home so that we can help another dog in a similar situation.’

Basil was fostered by Helena and her parents, Yvonne, 53, and Dale, 54, who run a civil engineering firm.

They have a five acre garden and six other dogs – ranging from a Yorkshire Terrier to a Great Dane.

The family, from Spalding in Lincolnshire, agreed to take him in after rescuers found him wondering the streets of Leeds.

It is not known how he came to be blind, but it is thought he may have been abandoned by his owner because of his disability.

West Yorkshire Dog Rescue are currently trying to find him a new, permanent home and say his novel headgear will help him in his new life.

The Muffin’s Halo was donated by 
Devon-based online company The Pet Business, which acts as a UK 
distributor for the product and has since sold many more.

Kathy Trout, founder of West Yorkshire Dog Rescue, said: ‘We’ve never seen anything like it. It’s revolutionary.

Basil was taken in by prison officer Helena Webster and her parents, but they are now trying to find him a new home as they already have six other dogs

The Halo is officially called Muffin's Halo. It was created in 2012 after LA publicist Silvie Bordeaux's poodle, Muffin, began to lose his sight

The guard comes in different novelty styles including butterfly wings, angel wings and quarterback shoulder pads costs between £40 to £75

‘The Muffin’s Halo has turned around Basil’s life. He used to live in a world of darkness, but now he’s much more aware of his surroundings.

‘We want dog owners around the UK to know that this aid exists, because it could help so many more blind dogs.’

The Muffin’s Halo was created by Los Angeles publicist Silvie Bordeaux in 2012 after her beloved 12-year-old toy poodle, Muffin, began to lose his sight.

The guard comes in different novelty styles including butterfly, angel wings and quarterback and prices online range between £40 to £75.
