A woman was remanded in custody today after falsely accusing her friend's son of rape.

Kelly Harwood had drunken consensual sex with the 30-year-old on a camp bed set up in her friend's kitchen.

But she started feeling guilty because she had betrayed her friend and told him she had not agreed to it moments after they stopped.

Harwood then called the police and said she had been raped while she had been asleep at the city centre flat in Aberdeen.

The man then ran to wake his mother who was sleeping in another room to tell her what had happened.

They both returned to the kitchen and Harwood told them not to worry because she was going to tell officers the truth.

However, when police arrived at the Aberdeen property she carried on with her lies and officers investigated the claims.

Harwood ended up charged with wasting police time and admitted committing the offence when she appeared in court.

Sentence was deferred until yesterday for a psychiatric and background report.

But the sheriff could not deal with the case because she had not turned up for the psychiatrist appointment.

Defence lawyer Graham Morrison told the court that his client suffered from an undiagnosed condition and was taking medication. 

He explained that Harwood hadn't turned up for her appointment because she had been suffering what she described as a 'black day'.

Sheriff Summers said he was remanding Harwood in custody to make sure that the report was prepared.

He said: 'If I don't remand you, I have no confidence that this case will ever be dealt with.'

Harwood, 43, previously admitted wasting police time on May 7 last year at the cost of 1,352 pounds when she appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.

Sentence was further deferred until later this month.
