A scarcity of lethal injection drugs has forced states to go back to the future to carry out capital punishments.

Tennessee has brought back the electric chair and both Wyoming and Utah are considering the use of firing squads, according to reports.

Republican Gov. Bill Haslam signed a bill into law Thursday allowing Tennessee to electrocute death row inmates when prisons are unable to obtain the necessary drugs, the state announced.

The drastic measure is just the first of what may be many as European drug makers are refusing to sell the cocktail of drugs normally used to execute death row inmates.

Tennessee lawmakers overwhelmingly passed the electric chair legislation in April, with the Senate voting 23-3 and the House 68-13 in favor of the bill.

The Volunteer State is also the first in the nation to bring the electric chair back into use without giving condemned inmates the option of an alternative method, according to Richard Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.

‘There are states that allow inmates to choose, but it is a very different matter for a state to impose a method like electrocution,’ he said. ‘No other state has gone so far.’

Dieter said he expects legal challenges to arise if the state decides to go through with an electrocution, both on the grounds of whether the state could prove that lethal injection drugs were not obtainable and constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment.

The electric chairs reintroduction to Tennessee came just as rumblings started in both Wyoming and Utah that those states are mulling over whether to bring back sharp shooters to carry out death sentences.

Give them the gas: Wyoming law currently requires inmates to die in a gas chamber similar to this one if no lethal injection drugs are available, but no such facility exists in the state

A Wyoming legislative committee has begun drawing up a bill that would allow firing squads to end the life of inmates 

Bob Lampert, director of the Wyoming Department of Corrections, told members of the Wyoming Legislature's Joint Interim Judiciary Committee the state has completely run out of the lethal injection drugs, and suggested an alternate method of executing inmates.

‘In the event that we had an execution scheduled and we couldn't carry it out as a result of lack of substances, I suggested to the Joint Judiciary that we may want to consider having an alternate means of execution, such as the firing squad,’ he said.

Laws currently on the books call for the state to execute inmates using a gas chamber should the need arise.

Wyoming has only one inmate currently on death row – Dale Wayne Eaton, who convicted in 2004 of the brutal 1988 sexual assault and murder of a teenage woman, according to the Billings Gazette.

A vote will not likely be held on the measure until July, during the state’s next legislative meeting.

The answer?: The execution chamber at the Utah State Prison is seen after Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by a firing squad in Draper June 18, 2010

Republican Utah legislator Paul Ray is also planning to float the idea later this year of bringing firing squad deaths back to the state.

‘It sounds like the Wild West, but it's probably the most humane way to kill somebody,’ said Ray.

It has been only four years since the last firing squad death in Utah – five police officers used .30-caliber Winchester rifles in 2010 to execute convicted murderer Ronnie Lee Gardner.

He actually chose to be killed by firing squad rather than lethal injection.

The state had outlawed it in 2004 but left open the possibility of anyone condemned to a death sentence prior to the ban to have the option, Gardner took it.

‘The prisoner dies instantly,’ Ray insisted. ‘It sounds draconian. It sounds really bad, but the minute the bullet hits your heart, you're dead. There's no suffering.’

Dieter said that if Utah brought back firing squads as a default option rather than leaving it up to inmates to choose, as was the practice before 2004, it could also be challenged in court.

Tennessee has 74 prisoners on death row and Utah has nine, state records showed.

The Supreme Court has never declared a method of execution unconstitutional on the grounds that it is cruel and unusual. It upheld the firing squad in 1879, the electric chair in 1890 and lethal injection in 2008.

Lethal injection is receiving more scrutiny as an execution method, especially after last month's botched execution in Oklahoma. In the Oklahoma case, inmate Clayton Lockett's vein apparently collapsed and he suffered a fatal heart attack 43 minutes after the process began.

Many other states including Oklahoma, Missouri and Texas also use lethal injection for the death penalty. Authorities in those states have also expressed concern about difficulties obtaining the necessary drugs.

The states are looking for alternative execution methods as lethal injection drug supplies dry up

Utah abolished firing squads in 2004 but last executed a man using one in 2010 because he chose the method prior to it being outlawed

Wyoming law requires a gas chamber to be used should no lethal injection drugs be available - the state has no gas chamber
