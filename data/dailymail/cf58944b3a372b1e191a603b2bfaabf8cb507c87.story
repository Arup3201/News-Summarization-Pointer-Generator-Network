Knock knock. Who's there?

The last thing you'd expect is a two-and-a-half metre snake at your door.

When a Queensland family discovered a carpet python slithering up the side of the back door outside their home, they were in for a big surprise.

But snake catcher Richie Gilbert came to the rescue when he was called to a home in Buderim on the Sunshine Coast on Thursday night.

'It brought a smile to my face when I saw him,' Mr Gilbert told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was awesome because normally pythons are found curled up behind someone's cupboard but this little fella was fully stretched out and reaching upwards across the brick wall.

'He was holding himself up by just the tip of its tail, which is something I hadn't seen before.'

Earlier in the day, the homeowner spotted the reptile but he managed to move it to the back of the block and away from the property but he spotted it against the brick wall  shortly after 8pm.

'I'd imagine the male snake might have been trying to get into the roof because he caught a female snake's pheromone trail, which is a scent that females release.'

The snake catcher was amazed at what he saw, that he took  to his Facebook business page and posted a joke after his catch.

'Knock knock, Honey I'm home!!! Imagine opening the door to this big fella. You might get a bit of a fright,' he posted on Facebook.

'If it made me smile I'm sure all you guys will love it too. Amazing animals. So strong.'

Mr Gilbert runs his own business called Sunshine Coast Snake Catcher, which operates 24 hours and seven days a week and has been catching snakes since the age of five.

'I can't put my finger on what attracted me to them but I have always loved chasing them since I was little. And I love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when I catch them,' he said.

When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance

Mr Gilbert has been quite busy during the summer season, saying he received 15 phone calls by Friday afternoon and catching and relocating seven of them from people's homes.

After Mr Gilbert catches the reptiles, he releases them back into the wild.

'We try to release them in the same geographical area and I don't like to take them too far away from where they were found. But it has to be a far distance away so they don't come back,' he said.

'But if it's a venomous snake, a lot more thought goes into them and we try to release them far away as possible from residential areas.'

When it doubt about spotting a snake, Mr Gilbert suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance.

'Send it to us and we can identify it for you and if its venomous or not and whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them,' he said.

'If the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms, it's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us.'
