Six years of hard luck stories have finally been put to bed. It was beautiful and ugly in equal measures at the Millennium Stadium as Wales at last overcame their demons to secure the most tense and precious of victories over South Africa.

There was to be no more choking in Cardiff - even if there were moments when Wales looked like coughing up their six-point lead. There were to be no more late slip-ups that have so often been part of the script in the previous run of 22 defeats by the Southern Hemisphere powerhouses.

Wales have a history of making life difficult for themselves in these big games. Again they rode their luck, but four penalties from full back Leigh Halfpenny proved enough to get Warren Gatland’s side over that elusive line.

‘They don’t make it easy on the coaches,’ said Gatland. ‘I couldn’t watch the last ten minutes. I was watching it in the box on the TV. We took a different approach to this autumn and I think we’re the only country that had the confidence or the courage to do that. We’ve wounded one of the big beasts and they will come back fighting even harder next time.’

It was one of those ‘pinch yourself’ moments. Wales had one previous win in 108 years and 29 Tests against the Rainbow Nation, but now the monkey is off their back. With less than 12 months until the World Cup, the psychological boost will be invaluable. No more talk of ‘hoodoos’ and just, in the words of skipper Sam Warburton, talk about moving forwards.

‘We’ve been in that position so many times that it didn’t feel alien,’ said Warburton. ‘There was more talk in that last five minutes than I’ve ever heard. That’s where we’ve made mistakes in the past. For me this is a career highlight. Now we’ve set the standard and we need to kick on.’

Wales started with intent, fly half Dan Biggar setting the early standard with some sublime handling. They retained possession through 12 phases and, after Rhys Webb was taken out off the ball, Halfpenny kicked his first penalty to open the scoring. But South Africa No 10 Pat Lambie quickly levelled from 46 metres.

The hosts enjoyed more possession in the opening quarter but aggressive counter-rucking from the Springboks acted to stem the flow of attack. Not even a 15-man line-out could push Wales over the line as their opponents absorbed all pressure. Beautiful it was not, with the half time score level, as had been the case against both Australia and New Zealand.

Wales take little comfort from what has occurred before. There was a cynical feeling of inevitability around the Millennium Stadium but some of those demons were eased when Sam Warburton won a 47th-minute penalty, which was kicked by Halfpenny to put his side back in front, although again it was cancelled out by Lambie.

It was turning into an arm wrestle; an ugly scrap offering more tension than spectacle. Again the responsibility fell on Halfpenny to keep the scoreboard rolling and two penalties from the Lions star, one following an unstoppable drive from the Welsh scrum, put his side six points ahead with less than half an hour remaining. Physicality is part and parcel of this fixture and Boks skipper Jean de Villiers was the first to drop, with the 105-cap centre requiring an oxygen supply as he was carted off with a dislocated kneecap.

When winger Cornal Hendricks was shown a yellow card in the 63rd minute for taking out Halfpenny in the air, it looked like fortune might finally be about to favour the Welsh.

‘The yellow card was a turning point because we had to go into defensive mode,’ said Springboks head coach Heyneke Meyer. ‘I don’t know if it’s worthwhile going up in the air anymore because it’s always going to be 50-50. It’s a grey area that we need to sort out. The referee is always right and we have to face that.’

This was the time to turn the screw. Wales pushed and pushed but, with the line at his mercy, hooker Scott Baldwin fell just short. If South Africa were going to come back, that would be the costly moment. Memories of Nelspruit, when Wales coughed up a 17-point lead, began to creep in. Springbok full-back Willie le Roux was their tormentor in June but, against the odds, the gifted No 15 was guilty of the an amateur handling error on his own five-metre line.

Still Wales failed to capitalise and, with Hendricks back on the field, errors began to creep into their game. All of a sudden South Africa are camped deep in opposition territory but Wales held on, just, to secure one of their most famous victories.
