Former England coach Andy Flower has leapt to the defence of Alastair Cook's captaincy ahead of the upcoming Test series against India.

Cook, who captains England's Test and one-day sides, has endured a torrid 2014 with an Ashes whitewash preceding recent series defeats by Sri Lanka in both formats.

The 29-year-old has also struggled badly with the bat but Flower, who resigned in January after the Ashes, has told the Sunday Telegraph that Cook is still the right man for the job.

Flower said: 'It seems to be forgotten, and people should not forget, that this is a young man, a 29-year-old man, who has done some extraordinary things for his country.

'He has scored the most Test centuries for his country â€“ that in itself is an amazing achievement, and he's got so much more left to give.'

Cook's captaincy had started so promisingly with England recording their first Test series win in India for 17 years back in December 2012.

He flourished with the bat on the subcontinent and positive results continued into 2013 with the Essex man guiding England to a 3-0 Ashes win over Australia last summer before it all turned sour.

The main criticism labelled at Cook by the likes of Shane Warne is a perceived lack of tactical awareness and cricketing nous in the field, but Flower cited the win in India as evidence to the contrary.

He said: 'He's led the side to an astounding Test victory in India, against the odds, and in the main on pitches which England have traditionally struggled on, and tactically he was excellent in India. If he hadn't been, we would not have won.'

The five-Test series against the Indians starts at Trent Bridge on Thursday and Flower urged the English public to get behind Cook and his struggling side as they look to stop the rot.

Flower said: 'He is an outstanding cricketer and we, the English public, should be proud of having Alastair Cook as one of our own, leading the Test side. They should not be duped into thinking otherwise by those that have the platform to shout loudest. They should make their own judgment about a fine, proud Englishman leading the England cricket team.'
