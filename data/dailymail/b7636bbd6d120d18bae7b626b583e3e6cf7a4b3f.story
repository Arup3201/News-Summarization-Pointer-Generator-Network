A hunt for two missing fishermen was called off today as rescue teams found their stricken vessel and its liferaft on the sea bed.

Coastguards had been searching since Thursday for Robert Prowse, 23, and Jack Craig, 22, who went missing while at sea.

The body of their skipper David McFarlane, 35, was found yesterday.

The survey ship Odyssey Explorer discovered the wreck of their 35ft-long boat the Purbeck Isle lying 10 miles off Portland, in Dorset, at a depth of 50 metres.

The vessel was reported missing on Thursday evening.

Desperate efforts to find his two companions continued amid hopes Mr Prowse and Mr Craig could have taken to the liferaft of the boat when they ran into difficulty.

But these were dashed when the raft was discovered on board the wreck at 11am today.

Portland Coastguard's Rescue Co-ordination Centre manager Mark Rodaway said: 'After a prolonged and extensive three-day search, sadly, the time has now passed when we could have hoped that the two remaining crew members from the Purbeck Isle would be found alive.

'Our final area of investigation was to search for the missing liferaft in the hope that they had been able to board it before the vessel sank, but sadly this new information means that this search will now be terminated.

'Our thoughts are with the families of all three crewmen at this difficult time.'

The 36ft wooden vessel - discovered by a survey ship lying ten miles off the Dorset coast - is thought to have broken up suddenly and sunk after getting swamped by choppy seas off Portland Bill.

The 50-year-old boat, the Purbeck Isle DH104, disappeared so quickly that the three men didn’t have the chance to put out a Mayday alert.

The same boat was involved in two incidents last year, once in June when the skipper lost two fingers and was airlifted to hospital.

The other was in January last year when the boat began to take on water and had to be towed to safety by the RNLI.

The three men on board were named locally as captain David MacFarlane, 36, and the two crew members as Robert Prowse, 22, and Jack Craig, also in his twenties

According to locals they crew had been 'whelking' and had been moving equipment from one place to another.

A major air and sea search had been launched involving three navy warships; the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Wave Ruler, and HMS York, a type 42 Destroyer, and one American Navy supply vessel, the 2nd Lt John P Bobo, to search for the men.

Coastguards repeatedly tried to contact the crew over the VHF radio but were met with silence.

The search for the men had previously been called off at night 2am and hopes of finding the remaining fishermen alive are now rapidly fading following the discovery of the wreckage.

Mother of missing fisherman Mr Prowse said she was alerted at midnight to the fact her son was missing.

Maxine Prowse, 45, lives in Plymouth where she is a full-time carer to her other son, Peter. Her son Mr Prowse has three children, all aged under five.

Through sobs, his mother said: 'I didn't know until midnight when his dad rang me.

'I'm just listening to the news now and waiting. I haven't seen him in the last couple of years because I moved to Plymouth.

'But he's a hard-working lad, he's always down on the harbour in the summer crabbing and getting holiday maker to do it too. He has a lot of friends.'

Rob Brown, a local skipper, said no one knew what had happened but working with pots could be dangerous.

He said: 'If you are pulling in pots and one gets stuck and it can pull the boat down and then if a wave hits you and everyone is on deck there might not be time to raise the alarm.'

Dave Pitman, another skipper, said: 'They were working with whelking pots as I understand it.

'They were moving the gear from one place to another which is a normal operation. We just all hope they are safe.'

Andy Alcock, the secretary of the Weymouth and Portland Fishermen and Licensed Boatmen Association, said: 'There was a life raft on board and there is a chance the men are in that and have been blown up and down the Channel and are awaiting rescue.'

The sea conditions for yesterday were said to have been reasonable, although the sea swell built up to a choppy state by the afternoon.

Fred Caygill, a spokesman for Portland coastguard which is co-ordinating the operation, said: 'The boat went out yesterday morning and was seen leaving the harbour at 8.30am.

'We received a call at 5.40pm from a fisherman who was concerned about the Purbeck Isle. The vessel’s buyers who had been waiting back at port had been unable to make contact with the men for a while.

'We commenced a major air and sea search for the Purbeck Isle but with no specific location we went over its usual fishing grounds which are up to six miles off Portland Bill.

'We have tried to make contact with the vessel over the VHF radio but received nothing back.

'We also made VHF broadcasts to alert other vessels of the search and also to request any vessels that could assist in the search.

We are in touch with the men’s families and the police.

'We obviously live in hope of finding the men and we will continue with this search and keep going for the best part of today.'
