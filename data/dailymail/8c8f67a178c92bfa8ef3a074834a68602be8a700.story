Arrest: Jennifer Perry, a first-year high school teacher, allegedly had sexual contact with a student

A 27-year-old married teacher has been arrested for allegedly engaging in a sex act with a 17-year-old student after she told the school there were 'false' rumors going around that they'd had a relationship.

The school contacted authorities and Jennifer Marie Perry, from Odenville, Alabama, surrendered to the Jefferson County Jail on Monday and has been charged with sexual contact with a student under 19.

Perry, who was in her first year of teaching at Pinson Valley High School, is accused of meeting the student at a parking lot a few miles from the campus on February 8 and engaging in a consensual sex act inside a car.

She did not teach the boy but attends church with him and his family, said Sergeant Jack Self of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office. She is believed to have known him before working for the school, he added.

On February 23, she wrote a letter to school administrators and told them there was a false rumor going around school that she had sexual contact with a student.

The school launched an investigation and found reason to believe the rumor was in fact true, Sergeant Self said.

When they met with her on February 24, they said they would be passing their findings on to the school board and local authorities, and she handed in her resignation.  

The sheriff's office launched an investigation that day and spoke to the alleged victim as well as other students. Perry was not willing to speak with them, Sergeant Self said.

Double-life: Perry met her husband, Blake (pictured) in their freshman year of high school and married in 2011. She did not teach her alleged victim but knew him and his family through church, authorities said

Authorities obtained a warrant against Perry and she turned herself in on Monday but was later released after posting $30,000 bond. She is now awaiting trial.

Authorities believe the incident was a one-time occurrence, Sergeant Self said.

The family of the alleged victim, who know Perry and her family, expressed their relief that she had been arrested, Sergeant Self said. 

Perry married her husband, Blake, in May 2011, according to Facebook.

They met when they were freshman in high school and have been together ever since, she wrote on a bio on the school's website. They now live together with their three dogs.

She is a graduate of Jacksonville State University and was in her first year of teaching at the school, according to the bio. She is listed as a ninth-grade English teacher.

Probe: She wrote a letter to officials at Pinson Valley High School saying there was a false rumor going around about the incident. The school launched an investigation and they allegedly found evidence that it did occur

'I am incredibly excited to be spending my first year as a Pinson Valley Indian spreading my love of literature with students,' she wrote.  

Speaking to AL.com, Chief Deputy Randy Christian expressed his shock that Perry had successfully navigated the competitive process of achieving a teaching job just to throw it away.

'It's also kind of amazing they believe it's possible a teen will keep their little secret,' he said. 

'The school administration is to be commended for taking immediate action. That was helpful to us in bringing this to a close.'
