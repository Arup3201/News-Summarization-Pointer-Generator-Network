The final autopsy report for Chicago chef Charlie Trotter has been released, revealing that he died due to a stroke.

The 54-year-old chef was found dead in his Chicago home by his young son earlier this month, and now the medical examiner's office has given more information about the chef's health problems.

They concluded that he 'died of a cerebrovascular accident (a stroke) as a consequence of hypertensive arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (high blood pressure).'

Final appearance: Charlie Trotter spoke at a culinary conference and he flew to Wyoming to attend just three days before he was found dead

The Monday report made it clear that 'neither drugs nor alcohol contributed to his death', according to The Chicago Tribune.

Another concern that came immediately after his November 5 death was that Trotter, who had closed his eponymous restaurant in 2012, would exacerbate his supposed brain aneurysm by traveling but the medical examiner has ruled that out.

'There is no scientific evidence to indicate that recent travel contributed to his death, though there was evidence of a prior stroke,' the report read.

His wife Rochelle Trotter put out a statement in the days following his death, confirming that he had been cleared to fly and had permission from medical experts to attend a food conference in Wyoming just three days before he was found dead.

She said that her husband learned of his brain aneurysm in January and had been taking the 'proper medication.

She denied the claims made in the 
police report from the officers who responded to Trotter's death, saying
that they were wrong to say that he flew to Wyoming 'against medical 
advice'.

Mrs Trotter did not
specifically say which doctors cleared him, but did say that 'medical 
experts' said it was fine for him to fly.

'The autopsy indicates the travel is not connected with his death,' she said, referring to the initial autopsy report.

A sommelier who worked with Trotter and became a close friend over their years of working together said that doctors had told Trotter not to fly to avoid adding pressure to his brain.

'It was a time bomb, and he felt that he didn't have a lot of time left,' sommelier Larry Stone told The Chicago Tribune.

The last picture? Trotter spoke at a culinary conference in Jackson Hole and one audience member noticed that his left hand- seen in his pocket while posing with attendee Megan Gallagher- was shaking

'It was inoperable, and it was not something that could be repaired; it was deep inside the brain.'

Mr Stone told the paper that his 54-year-old former boss had multiple seizures in the time leading up to his death.

The first hints of trouble came last year when he closed his award-winning restaurant after 25 years, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family and study philosophy.

That didn't keep him from staying active, in spite of doctor's orders.

Nothing
seemed particularly unusual about Trotter during the Jackson Hole conference, but 
one audience member did notice that the chef's left hand was shaking 
slightly as he held the microphone.

The chef's wife Rochelle was seen by neighbors screaming and crying hysterically as ambulances arrived at their home after Trotter's son Dylan found his father unconscious.

'He was much loved and words cannot describe how much he will be missed,' she said in a statement.

'His impact upon American cuisine and the culinary world at large will always be remembered.'

Multi-course tasting menus that are now seen on many fine dining establishments were his handiwork, as he traded the 10-course menu at his flagship restaurant on a daily basis and boasted that frequent customers never had the same thing twice.

He had a great influence on both the local and national food scene, one that many expect to be felt for years to come.

Wine was a passion for Trotter, and when asked at the event in Jackson Hole what he would like for his final meal, he said he wanted only the best: a bottle of 1900 Chateau Margaux, a wine that costs up to $16,000.

During an interview when he decided to close his restaurant, he revealed his grand plans for what would happen to his restaurant's 26,000-strong wine cellar after it closed last year.

'I did a mathematical 
calculation: If I live to the average life expectancy of the American 
male — 78.9 — and I consume one bottle of wine every day, I should 
consume the last bottle on my last day on this planet,' he said in an 
interview with The New York Times.
