For Ally McCoist, the least enjoyable episodes of his club’s much vaunted journey back up the leagues have taken place on plastic. It is a clearly a sentiment shared by his battered and bruised players.

If Saturday’s 1-1 draw at part-time Alloa was shrugged off by McCoist as merely a ‘blip’ in an otherwise impressive run of results, the news that injuries sustained by Lewis Macleod and Nicky Clark will keep them out ‘for weeks’ came as an undoubted blow to the Rangers boss.

McCoist declined to openly slaughter the artificial Indodrill Stadium surface, but Rangers midfielder Ian Black described it yesterday as ‘a shambles’, while captain Lee McCulloch’s succinct verdict on Saturday evening was that it was ‘worse than Stenhousemuir’s’.

Rangers manager Ally McCoist has lost key players to injuries during matches played on artificial surfaces 

But the manager made little secret of his disdain for non-grass surfaces as he revealed yesterday how he point blank refuses to let his players even train on the 3G surfaces at Murray Park for fear of fresh injuries.

It won’t have escaped his attention that first-choice keeper Cammy Bell has not played since damaging his shoulder on the plastic pitch at Falkirk in a 2-0 win last month, ironically with goals from the injured Macleod and Clark. Kenny Miller has also mustered just five minutes of action since pulling up at Westfield that Friday night.

And, perhaps with that in mind ahead of his side’s return to Falkirk in the League Cup on Tuesday, McCoist last night chose to damn the Bairns’ surface with faint praise.

‘As artificial surfaces go that I’m not keen on, their one is the best,’ quipped the Rangers manager.

‘I do understand the economics of some of the clubs requiring them but I’m not a great fan.

‘Alloa, Queen of the South and Falkirk all have them but you don’t get any two pitches the same. They are different quality, the fabric is different, so I have to take into account the surface before I pick my team.

‘Clearly, in our team there are boys who are less comfortable on those surfaces than others. Two years ago David Templeton got a horrendous injury which was certainly down to the surface at Annan. He was out for the best part of eight weeks and it’s probably on his mind when he goes on that surface.

‘I can understand why people would maybe want to train on the surface they were going to be playing on but I wouldn’t do that because – rightly or wrongly – I think there’s a greater scope for injuries.

‘I don’t even use the artificial surface here (at Murray Park) for that reason. I don’t like training on them because you run the risk of injury.

‘I would be loathe to say that Macleod and Clark’s injuries were caused by the Alloa pitch, but Lewis went over on his ankle and hurt his foot and Nicky, when he fell, hurt his shoulder. But I will reserve comment on that.

‘And the bottom line is that the players have got to play on plastic pitches. They might not like it but it’s the same for both teams - and there are no excuses.’

Forward Nicky Clark also hurt himself on Alloa's artificial surface on Saturday and is out of the Falkirk match

For McCoist, the loss of Macleod and Clark deprives him of two of his top men as he seeks to close in on a first cup win for the Ibrox side since their League Cup triumph over Celtic in 2011.

‘Of course it’s a blow for us because they’ve been two of our in-form players,’ he nodded.

‘And with Kenny and Cammy also out, these are big players missing for us, although Lee Wallace will be back and I wouldn’t hesitate to pitch Jon Daly into the team now that he is back from injury.

‘Our medical department are reluctant to put times on anything, but I think Macleod and Clark will be out for weeks rather than months. I don’t think they will manage the next league game (against Hibernian at Ibrox next Monday) but I would be delighted to be proved wrong.’

After watching star striker Kris Boyd draw a blank at Alloa at the weekend, McCoist insisted that he has no concerns over the Ibrox favourite’s lack of a league goal so far since his return to the club

‘Boydy’s scored five in the cups,’ he pointed out. ‘We’re all convinced that he will be off and running soon. If you watch him in training, he’s one of the most natural finishers we have ever had. It is only a matter of time because he starts scoring regularly.’

Meanwhile, Falkirk goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald believes that his side can avenge their narrow 2-0 defeat to Rangers at Westfield last month.

The Bairns enjoyed the upper hand for the vast majority of the encounter, but a Macleod strike that took a huge deflection off Alan Maybury gave McCoist’s men the breakthrough Falkirk could not find for themselves. A late second from Clark six minutes from time killed off any hopes the hosts had of a comeback.

‘If we can play the same way we did that night we are definitely capable of winning this time,’ said the former Hearts keeper.

‘We played great for 70 to 75 minutes and then lost a very unfortunate goal to Macleod by a huge deflection and that effectively won the game for them.

‘After that it opened up a bit because we were chasing the game and had to try to get a goal back.

‘But hopefully this time our luck will change and we can turn chances into goals.’
