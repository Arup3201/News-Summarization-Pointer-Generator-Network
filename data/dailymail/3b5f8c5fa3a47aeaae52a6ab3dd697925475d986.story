Moors Murderer Ian Brady’s 14-year hunger strike is a sham, it was revealed yesterday.

The child killer regularly makes himself toast and packet soup and nurses turn a blind eye to save him from embarrassment.

Brady, 75, looked unexpectedly healthy when he was seen in public last week for the first time in almost 50 years.

Anger: Alan Bennett, whose brother Keith was one of Brady's victims, said the supposed hunger strike was 'farcical'

He is appearing before a mental health tribunal where he is pleading to be sent from a secure hospital back to prison.

Yesterday his lawyer revealed what his
victims’ families had long suspected – that he has been allowing 
himself food for several years.

Farcically, nurses turn a blind eye 
out of ‘respect’, even knocking before entering his room to save him the
embarrassment of catching him eating.

Brady has officially been force-fed 
since 1999 after he stopped eating in protest at being moved to a 
different ward.

He will today make a personal plea to be moved back to 
prison so he can starve himself to death.

Yesterday, on the sixth day of the 
tribunal, the judge questioned why it had taken so long for the sham to 
emerge.

Alan Bennett, whose brother Keith was one of Brady’s victims but
whose burial site has never been revealed by the killer, said he looked
‘fit and well which is what I expected after being told many times over
the years that he has never been fitter, despite his farcical supposed 
“hunger strike”’.

Brady tortured and murdered five children in the 1960s along with accomplice Myra Hindley.

Nurse Mark Sheppard gave a vivid 
account of Brady’s life on Forster Ward at Ashworth secure hospital, 
Merseyside.

The hearing is taking place at the hospital, but proceedings
are being relayed to a Manchester courtroom.

Mr Sheppard, who has worked with the 
killer for two years, said he spent most of his time in his room and 
liked hot water brought so he could make packet soups.

Brady’s barrister, Nathalie Lieven, 
QC, asked him: ‘Mr Brady’s eating, isn’t he?’ Mr Sheppard replied: ‘Ian 
does eat other foods as well.’

Miss Lieven went on: ‘He’s not actually 
on hunger strike by now, is he?’

Mr Sheppard conceded: ‘What we observe 
every day is very, very contradictory of what most people would regard 
as a hunger strike.’

Questioned by Judge Robert Atherton, Mr Sheppard 
explained: ‘The reality is that we know Ian makes himself toast every 
morning. I would say most days we observe Ian eating.’

He added that the killer still 
received ‘small amounts’ of food through the nasogastric tube which 
could be seen taped to his face as he sat silently through yesterday’s 
proceedings.

‘If I observe he’s eating, I knock on the door to give him 
the opportunity to put it aside and save him the embarrassment,’ Mr 
Sheppard added.

Victims: Keith Bennett, whose body has never been recovered, left, and John Kilbride, right, were two of the youngsters killed by Moors murderer Ian Brady during the 1960s

Lured to their deaths: Brady and his partner Myra Hindley killed Edward Evans, left, in October 1965. Pauline Reade, right, 16, disappeared on her 
way to a disco on July 12, 1963

He said Brady regarded keeping up the 
hunger strike as ‘work I have to do’ but at one stage decided to take 
weekends off.

Nurses do not challenge Brady as the fiction ‘serves some 
purpose for Ian’, Mr Sheppard said.

‘It is his continued stance that he is on hunger strike because of his perceived battle with the Home Office,’ he added.

Mr Sheppard said it was all part of ‘valuing his individuality and displaying respect’.

But he also gave a chilling account of
how Brady ‘bared his teeth’ and ‘grimaced’ in rage as he tried to stab 
him in the face with a pen after refusing to take his dose of morphine 
for severe back pain.

Mr Sheppard said Brady twice came at him with an 
uncapped ballpoint last September, which resulted in the prolific 
letter-writer being banned from having a pen.

The tribunal was also told how 
videotapes featuring ‘violent sexually explicit elements’ were found in a
search of his room in 2007.

Consultant psychologist David Glasgow,
called by Brady’s legal team, said the killer believed staff 
‘embellished or invented’ such incidents to ‘pathologise his behaviour’ 
and unsettle him.

Mr Glasgow said Brady could be 
thoughtful, civil and caring to staff.

He said the main risk of sending 
him back to jail would be that an inmate would try to kill him, but that
Brady himself had said: ‘As long as it is quick, that is fine by me.’

The hearing continues.
