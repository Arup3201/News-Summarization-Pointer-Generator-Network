Taxpayers have forked out more than £300million on flights and ‘bribes’ to persuade foreign criminals and illegal immigrants to go home.

The bill has been racked up over the past five years as officials struggle to clear a huge backlog of overseas convicts, visa over-stayers and people who sneaked into the UK in the back of lorries. 

In some cases, the migrants could only be convinced to leave with the help of so-called ‘assistance’ packages worth up to £1,500 each.

They are free to spend the cash on education, medical bills, housing and even setting up a business back home.

The highest sums were £68million spent in the year ending April 2010 and £71.8million the following year. Last night Tory MPs said much of the blame rested with Labour, which handed the current Government a border system in chaos.

The bill only includes flights, assistance grants and, for violent offenders, guards on the journey. If the cost of prison sentences and the time taken by Home Office staff to process the paperwork are included, the total would be far higher.

Tory MP Michael Ellis, a member of Westminster’s home affairs select committee, said: ‘This is another example of the appalling legacy and the incompetence of the previous Labour government, which lost control of our borders and security arrangements and created an overweening bureaucracy.’

The figures were revealed to Labour MP Frank Field, a member of the Balanced Migration campaign group, in a Parliamentary written answer. 

It gives a total bill of £306million between 2009-10 and 2013-14 – including £55.3million in the last year alone.

Migrationwatch chairman Lord Green of Deddington said: ‘The removal of immigration offenders is absolutely fundamental to the credibility of the entire system. This figure illustrates the huge cost of each case.’

He said that, given the level of public concern about immigration, the system was in need of more resources.

Under the facilitated removals programme – offered to foreign criminals and immigration offenders who agree to drop any remaining appeals – the grant can be used to set up a business, take an education course or pay for housing or medical expenses.

Handouts are worth £1,500 if a foreign prisoner signs up while serving their sentence or £750 if they wait until they have been released from jail. The grant is paid in cash, with the foreign nationals handed a pre-paid cash card on departure containing £500.

On return home, they get the rest by contacting the International Organisation for Migration which administers the scheme for the Home Office whose officials argue it is cheaper than forcibly deporting them after a long legal battle.

A vast camp for migrants in Calais will open this morning, sparking fears it will attract hundreds more to the French town.

It will offer beds, showers, food and even power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach Britain from the port. The Jules Ferry camp was built using a £3million EU grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from British taxpayers.

Critics compare the centre to the Sangatte camp which became a magnet for migrants before it was closed. Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘It is bonkers for the Calais authorities to do anything which encourages migrants to their town. It will only create problems for us next.’

By March the 12 acre camp, with three football pitches and a tennis court, will be able to feed 1,500 migrants by day and sleep 500. It is believed officers from the UK Border Force will be on site to inform migrants of the realities of entering Britain, in an apparent effort to dissuade them.

Last October, ministers were attacked by the UK’s spending watchdog for failing to deport more foreign criminals. The National Audit Office said the number of foreign prisoners had gone up despite a near tenfold increase in officials working on their cases.

There are 12,250 foreign offenders in the UK and the Government spends around £850million a year on managing them.

Huge sums are also being spent on compensation for foreign criminals and illegal immigrants who were kept locked up for too long while officials fought to deport them. Over the past four years, the total bill is £17million – with recipients including sex offenders, robbers and drug dealers.

Judges decided the claimants had been ‘unlawfully detained’ because the Home Office continued to hold them even though they did not have a realistic prospect of booting them out.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Those with no right to be in the UK should return home and we are determined to crack down on immigration offenders. 

'Thanks to the efficiency savings made by this Government, the annual cost of removing foreign nationals with no right to be here has fallen by almost a quarter – while the number of voluntary returns has risen sharply, from just over 27,000 in 2010 to more than 39,000 in 2013.’
