Britain's soggy summer looks set to continue until at least the start of the Olympics with forecasters pointing the finger of blame at the jet stream for two months of torrential downpours.

As the country endured another sodden week, following the wettest spring and early summer period since records began, it emerged that the wet weather will continue for another seven to 10 days.

Matt Dobson, forecaster at MeteoGroup, 
said the main culprit was the jet stream, a fast wind that blows round 
the planet and moves our surface pressure systems.

‘Our
weather is really stuck in a rut because the jet stream is further 
south than it should be at this time of the year – over France and 
northern Spain – and we are under a blanket of low pressure on the 
northern side of it,’ he said.

‘Although there will be some sunny interludes – with Monday not looking too bad – the weather will remain unsettled. 

‘Tuesday
and Thursday will see the worst of it, with thundery downpours on the 
way for Tuesday and heavy rain set to sweep through the country from the
south-west on Thursday.’

The weather is already causing problems and tonight drivers trying to get home along the M62 in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, were caught out by flash flooding.

The heavy rain built up on the lanes and resulted in queues of slow-moving traffic, while other cars barely made it through the deep surface water.

This weekend, roads turned into rivers amid flooding in Devon, leaving many homes under water, racegoers at 
Silverstone were towed out of the mud and the Wimbledon final was 
interrupted by downpours.

One driver died when his car left the road after a month’s 
worth of rain fell in just 24 hours in many parts of the country.

Mr Dobson said despite the unsettled weather prevailing, today and tomorrow will be brighter.

He said: 'Today we are looking 
at more scattered showers but it should be a little bit better than it 
has been over the past few days. Looking ahead it is a very unsettled week with no respite from the wet weather.

Rut: Our weather is stuck because the jet stream is further south than it should be at this time of year - over France and Spain, meaning Britain is under a blanket of low pressure on the northern side of it

Outlook: The nation can look forward to days of more cloud and rain this week. Wednesday looks especially bad in the south with heavy rain and thunder on the way although it is expected to clear up by Thursday

'There will be heavy downpours 
tomorrow and Thursday, particularly across England and Wales, and no 
sign of any sunny weather for the next 10 days.'

Mr Dobson said scattered heavy showers
were affecting east Wales and the West Midlands, with heavy 
thunderstorms over Herefordshire and Worcestershire.

Heavy showers will hit London and the 
south coast today, and there will be a risk of thunderstorms over 
central and eastern England, he said.

The
Environment Agency still has 89 flood alerts and 14 flood warnings in 
place, but the Met Office has no weather warnings currently issued for 
the UK.

But there is one piece of good news - the
incessant rain has finally spelled the end of the hosepipe ban. The 
final four water companies with bans announced they are lifting them 
with immediate effect.

Sales of a 'mood boosting' supplement have increased drastically because of the terrible British weather, figures suggest.

Sales of St John’s Wort increased by 115 per cent in June this year - the wettest June on record - compared to June 2011.

Schwabe
Pharma UK, manufacturer of St John’s Wort supplement KarmaMood, said 
the unseasonably wet weather may have led to an increase in the number 
of cases of seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

Oxfordshire
GP Dr David Edwards said: 'After an initial burst of sunshine in March 
people were lulled into a false sense of security that summer was just 
around the corner.

'However,
due to the unseasonably poor weather in May and June people who already
have a major problem with depression have been having relapses, and 
patients at the other end of the spectrum have been attending GP 
surgeries reporting that they are ‘tired all the time’.'

South East Water, Sutton and East Surrey
Water, Veolia Water Central and Veolia Water Southeast said the 
restrictions that have been in place since early April have now ended 
following the 'abnormally heavy rainfall' that has deluged much of the 
country.

A joint statement from the four companies said they were heavily dependent on ground water supplies but these have now recovered sufficiently to enable them to lift the bans.

It said: 'The companies would all like to thank their customers for complying with the restrictions and supporting their plea to use water wisely. This has kept demand for water well below levels normally experienced at this time of year.

'Significant - or indeed any - recharge of underground resources at this time of year is most unusual but it follows the abnormally heavy rainfall experienced since spring which has finally brought to an end the severe drought after two dry winters.'

Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman 
yesterday met flood victims in Devon, where a huge clean-up operation 
was under way after the area saw the worst of the bad weather.

Ms Spelman spoke of the importance of flood prevention schemes during a visit to Ottery St Mary, near Exeter, which had a number of defences put in place after previous flooding.

One of the culverts she was taken to protected 60 nearby properties from water entering their homes.

Resident Elizabeth Nickels, 62, who 
spoke to Ms Spelman about the flooding, said they had been incredibly 
lucky that the flood prevention scheme had been completed just weeks 
ago.

She said: 'The water 
was coming off East Hill in absolute torrents and they were absolutely 
unable to get in and out of that part of the town.

The next week to 10 days are crucial 
in determining what quality of grape harvest will be produced this year,
according to English winemakers.

Last
year’s heatwave, combined with a hard winter and a mild spring, helped 
produce a sensational crop which made around three million bottles of 
wine.

But with last month 
being the wettest June since records began, it has led to predictions 
that some producers face low fruit yields for this year’s October 
harvest.

Winemakers are 
hoping for a late burst of warmth and sunshine to encourage their vines 
to flower, and help create a good quality, bountiful crop.

Frazer
Thompson, chief executive officer of Chapel Down Wines in Tenterden, 
Kent, said: 'Without wishing to tempt fate, the next week to 10 days are
the ones that now really matter for all English winemakers.'

The
trade body, English Wine Producers, said some vineyards in Kent had 
been sheltered from the wet weather and were in line for a 'fantastic' 
crop.

'So we were so much luckier on this side of the town, I mean the defence worked, and thank goodness for it, when you think it’s only been finished a few weeks it was exactly at the right time.'

The Environment Secretary also spoke about how important social media had become as a way of warning residents as she thanked staff at the Met Office in Exeter for the work they have been doing to warn people about the bad weather.

Philip and Nolwenn Luke told Ms Spelman that the Environment Agency’s early warning text message system had allowed them to move their car to safety before the floods hit.

Ms Spelman said she had been given assurances that all Olympic sites would be resilient to floods after flooding at a park-and-ride car park in Weymouth, Dorset, which will be used to transport spectators to sailing events.

Elsewhere, firefighters had to be airlifted to safety by a coastguard helicopter when they became trapped by flood water while rescuing a flock of drowning sheep in Somerset, an RSPCA spokeswoman said.

The animals were stranded by rising water near a railway line at Batemans Farm in Chard, but were eventually rescued by RSPCA inspectors using a boat.

Canny shoppers are reaping record discounts on the high street as desperate retailers slash prices to clear stock after one of the wettest summers ever.

Scores of high street chains such as Debenhams, French Connection and Warehouse have cut prices of dresses, bikinis and summer clothes by up to 70 per cent, equivalent to savings of around £300million.

Over the weekend nine in 10 clothing chains were holding sales, giving discounts averaging 55 per cent, the highest ever price cuts for a July.

Marks & Spencer is offering 20 per cent off all swimsuits, while DIY chain B&Q has cut the price of many barbecues by a third.
