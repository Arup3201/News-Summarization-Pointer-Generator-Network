A Greyhound bus drove off an interstate highway in southwest Ohio early Saturday, struck a tree and a fence and flipped on its side before sliding to a stop in a cornfield, injuring at least 35 people.

None of the injuries was considered life-threatening, though several people were trapped and had to be extricated by firefighters and paramedics, the State Highway Patrol said in a statement.

There was no immediate word on the cause of the crash, but passenger Christopher Lake, of Michigan, told WCPO-TV in Cincinnati that he saw the driver slumped over.

Greyhound crash: A greyhound bus crashed in a field in southwest Ohio this morning, injuring 35

Cause: All 35 injured in the crash have non life-threatening injuries. There has been no immediate comment on the cause of the crash

Asleep at the wheel: One passenger says he saw the driver slumped over at the wheel and a woman yelling 'Wake up! Wake up!' before the crash

Lake said he heard a woman scream at the driver 'Wake up! Wake up!' but that he thinks the man might have had a medical problem.

The bus drove off the right side of northbound Interstate 75 about 25 miles north of Cincinnati at about 3:50 a.m., the patrol said.

Lake told the TV station the bus rolled over twice after hitting the tree.

Early morning: The bus was driving northbound on Interstate 75, 25 miles north of Cincinnati at 3:50am when the crash happened, patrols said

Looking into it: Authorities said the crash is still under investigation and haven't released a cause yet

Flown out: Six of the injured were taken to the hospital by helicopter while the rest went by ambulance

The bus, which left Cincinnati bound for Detroit, was carrying 51 passengers and the driver.

Those
 passengers who were not injured and those who were treated and released
 from hospitals were transported back to Cincinnati, but none of them 
were at the bus station later Saturday morning.

Lake, who was not injured, told WCPO he saw some children on the bus and thought some passengers had broken arms and legs

He said that the bus driver seemed fine when he boarded the bus.

The
 driver, who has been with the company for almost 15 years, had been on 
duty for an hour and was fully rested, Kim Plaskett, a spokeswoman for 
Dallas-based Greyhound Lines Inc., told the Associated Press.

The
 driver was among the injured, but she said she could not release the 
person's name or medical condition due to medical privacy laws.

The injured: Injuries ranged from minor to severe but none of them were life-threatening

Destination: The bus was driving to Detroit and was carrying 51 people total

Plaskett said she couldn't discuss any details of the crash or the possible cause. The company was cooperating with investigators and will talk to the driver to try to determine what happened, Plaskett said.

The bus just had its regular major annual inspection 14 days ago, Plaskett said.

She said drivers also do pre-trip inspections to make sure buses are fit for travel.

Greyhound sent a crisis-response team to the site to help the customers and authorities as soon as the company was notified of the crash, she said.

A telephone hotline was set up for friends and family members seeking information about the passengers on the bus. The phone number is 800-972-4583.

The skies were clear in the region early Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service.

Experienced: The driver who was behind the wheel of the Greyhound bus had been with the company for 15 years and was among those injured in the crash

Safe bus: The company says that the bus had just passed a major inspection just a few days before

Good morning for driving: There was no major weather going on in the region when the crash happened
