Backing Becks: Lord Coe has previously said that David Beckham should be knighted for his footballing prowess and efforts bringing the Olympic Games to London

The row over David Beckham’s knighthood snub in the New Year Honours List took a new twist last night after a split was revealed between Sebastian Coe and the man in charge of  the awards.

The Mail on Sunday, which revealed last week how Beckham and his wife Victoria had missed out on becoming Sir David and ‘Lady Posh’, has learned that the gong was approved by the secretive group headed by Lord Coe that deals with sports stars’ honours.

But that decision was unexpectedly overturned when it was passed to the main Honours Committee, chaired  by the head of the Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake.

With Lord Coe also a member of the main committee, Beckham’s award was expected to have been rubber-stamped.

But a fierce debate erupted at a meeting in November.

Several committee members argued that 38-year-old Beckham should be made to wait longer, with one claiming there was a danger  of ‘the Wiggins effect’ getting  out of hand - a reference to last year’s knighthood for cyclist Bradley Wiggins.

However, others pointed  out that unlike Wiggins, 33, Beckham’s sporting career is over following his retirement from playing football last May.

One source said: ‘It was unfair to say this was too soon. It was more than six years ago that he helped London win the right to host the Olympic Games.

‘The faceless wonders who decide honours are happy to  dole them out to time-serving politicians but not sports heroes who have achieved far more.’

However, another insider countered: ‘Senior figures in the sports world expressed concern about awards going to too many sportsmen too soon after Wiggins was knighted - and Coe was aware of that.’

The honours system is shrouded in secrecy and overseen by the Cabinet Office Honours and Appointments Secretariat. The identity of those who make nominations, widened in recent years to include members of the public, is kept secret.

Lord Coe had said the Sport Honours Committee believed a knighthood for Beckham was justified in view of his success on the football field and his support for London’s successful bid to host the Olympics.

As leader of the 2012 Games, Lord Coe had first-hand experience of Beckham’s contribution when they travelled to Singapore together in 2007  for the crucial vote.

Other members of the Sport Honours Committee who had backed Beckham included former England football manager Graham Taylor and Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson.
