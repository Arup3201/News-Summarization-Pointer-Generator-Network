Rapist Ched Evans could have to wait 14 months if he continues to try and have his conviction quashed

Convicted rapist Ched Evans could face a further 14 months out of football if he continues his fight to clear his name. 

Former Sheffield United player Evans has been shunned by several football clubs since he left prison after two-and-a-half years following his conviction for the rape of a 19-year-old woman. 

Now it appears his best hope of returning to the game appears to be having his conviction overturned. This could take more than a year to get to the Court of Appeal and will mean Evans will not have played a professional game for four years.

Because he is still on licence Evans is also barred from leaving Britain for extended periods, which has led him to put his wedding plans on hold, the Sun reported.  

Evans was released from prison last year after being found guilty of raping a drunk woman in a hotel in Rhyl in north wast Wales in 2011. 

He has continued to maintain his innocence.

Once he was released from prison Evans launched a website funded by the father of his fiancee Natasha Massey, to clear his name and applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in a bid to get his case heard by the Court of Appeal.

After the 26-year-old was released from prison an opportunity to return to his former club, Sheffield United, was withdrawn when several sponsors threatened to pull out of the club. 

Patrons including Charlie Webster also stepped down and Olympic champion Jessica Ennis said she would request her name be removed from a stand at the Bramall Lane stadium if Evans was re-signed.

This led to Mrs Ennis-Hill being threatened with rape on Twitter. 

The threats came weeks after Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan’s daughter, Chloe, was threatened with rape over the issue after Finningan said live on television that Evans should be allowed to return to football. 

Last week Oldham Athletic also confirmed it would not be offering the player a contract after a board member was told his daughter would be raped if the 26-year-old was allowed to play for the team. 

PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said he believed it would now be ‘very difficult’ for a club to sign the player while his rape conviction stood.

Evans has been supported by his fiancee Natasha Massey in his bid to overturn his conviction for rape 

It is expected to take months for the Criminal Cases Review Commission to decide whether the Evans case should go to the Court of Appeal, the Observer reported. 

On average this takes around 38 weeks, and decisions on whether to quash an appeal can take as long as six months. 

Ched Evans previously played for Sheffield United but has so far failed to secure a contract at another club

The former footballer will also have problems getting signed by a club overseas because he is still on licence after being sentenced for five years in prison for rape. 

This effectively bars him from working abroad and means he is unable to leave the country for extended periods. This has led him to put his wedding plans to Natasha Massey on hold so the pair can go on honeymoon abroad.  

Evans has been criticised for his lack of remorse since he left prison and last week issued a carefully crafted statement apologising for the 'effect that night in Rhyl' had on the woman concerned.

Some have questioned his rape conviction, saying they believe he does have a case for the Court of Appeal. These include commentator Rod Liddle who said there were 'grave doubts' about his conviction.
