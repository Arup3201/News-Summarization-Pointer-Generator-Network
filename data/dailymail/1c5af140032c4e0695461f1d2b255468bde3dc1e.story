Morrisons plans to take on its south of England rivals by wooing shoppers with upmarket ingredients and stylish stores.

The Northern-based supermarket firm has announced a drive to expand in the prosperous Home Counties.

Its new shops will stock more than 500 types of fresh produce and introduce more sophisticated items stocked by rivals Sainsbury and Waitrose.

Stores will sell the fashionable samphire sea vegetable, five types of chilli, purple potatoes and bottles of fine wine costing upwards of £20.

It has also started displaying its vegetables on beds of ice and spraying them with mists of water, which it says adds a touch of theatre.

The firm, which is Britain’s fourth biggest supermarket chain, has its headquarters in Bradford.

Trend: Morrisons CEO Dalton Philips said consumer confidence has fallen dramatically over the past few months

It claims to offer cheaper prices because it owns farms and produces fresh fruit and veg itself, and has traditionally been a big presence closer to its northern roots.

Currently Morrisons has only 31 shops within the M25 but it said that 60 per cent of all its new stores will be in the south.

It has outlets under development at Weybridge and Croydon in Surrey, and Harrow and Colindale in North London.

Chief executive Dalton Philips said consumer confidence dramatically fell over the past few months.

‘We are seeing shoppers skipping meals so they can save cash to feed their children,’ he said. ‘They are hiding treats around the house to ration them through the week, dipping into savings and recycling their clothes.

‘Year on year consumer confidence is worse and disposable income is down – it’s tough out there.’

The business, which claims to offer cheaper prices because it owns farms and produces fresh produce itself, has traditionally been a big player closer to its northern roots.

But it now feels the time is right to make its move on the more prosperous south as it fine tunes a new store format it thinks will appeal to a broader cross-section of shoppers.

Currently only 15pc of its new stores are in the south and by 2013/14 that will increase to two thirds of the retailer’s 2.5m sq. ft. network of new space.

It now has stores under development at Weybridge and Croydon in Surrey and Harrow and Colindale in north London.

Philips added: ‘The next three years will see a step-change in Morrisons southern presence bringing another 2m households within a 15 minute drive of our stores.

‘We are going to be food-focused, not generalists. We believe that UK grocery has got very functional.

‘Our new format allows us to see how we perform with different demographics, you always carry on tweaking the format but we have an offer that really travels down south.’
