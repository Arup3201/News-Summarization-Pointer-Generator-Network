A 13-year-old boy killed himself after being routinely forced to practise his own suicide every day by school bullies, it has been claimed.

The teenager leapt to his death from an apartment building in Otsu, central Japan, which has one of the world's highest suicide rates.

His death has prompted a series of bomb threats against the school and local government over claims they didn't do enough to stop the taunts.

There are also reports that his teacher apparently brushed off the abuse as a joke.

A letter sent to the boy's school this week threatened that the building would be bombed unless the
pupils and teachers involved apologise, local authorities said.

A local police officer said: 'The 
school called police Monday after receiving a threat in the mail, which 
demanded pupils and teachers involved in the bullying publicly 
apologise'.

Other threats included bombing 
regional government buildings, a local education board and even the 
police department, but it was unclear if one person was behind all the 
threats, they said.

A survey of 15 pupils at the school revealed that the boy was routinely subjected to a litany of abuse by bullies - but still nothing was done. It also revealed that his teacher was aware of problems but ignored them.

They described how the victim, who has not been named, was beaten in a bathroom, forced to practise taking his own life, and told to put a dead sparrow in his mouth.

He was also forced to shoplift for the bullies and extorted money from 'friends' and there were reports he was repeatedly held in a headlock and beaten, had his pants pulled down, and forced to eat dead bees.

The boy's parents are trying to sue three students, their parents and the Otsu Municipal Government, seeking damages of 77.2 million yen - approximately $966,235 - following his death in October last year.

The school has disputed any link between the allegedly abusive pupils and the boy's death while the local government admitted the boy had been bullied, but argued it could not be proved that the suicide was the result of the bullying.

The boy was found dead on October 11, close to his home. He did not leave a suicide note. Police said at the time the cause of his death was suicide.
