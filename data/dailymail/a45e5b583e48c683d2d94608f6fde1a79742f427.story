Police say they lacked any leads until the victim recently saw pictures of his stolen guns on his Facebook friend Banegas' page.

The two had been friends and the victim told police he didn't check Banegas' Facebook page because he didn't suspect him.

Banegas, who is thought to be a father in his late 30s, is now facing charges of aggravated burglary, larceny of a firearm, and tampering with evidence. 

It isn't known if he has an attorney.

Banegas' Facebook page is still activated.
