With a motivational speaker like this guy among their ranks, it's no wonder the East View High School Patriots were able to turn round a half-time deficit to record a remarkable win.

In a speech which could teach a number of NFL stars a thing a or two, Apollos Hester offered more than a few inspirational words on the importance of never giving up and staying positive.

His team had been down 28-14 at half time during their match with Vandegrift High School on Friday, but managed to come back to a storming 42-41 comeback win.

'Awesome feeling': In a speech which could teach a number of NFL stars a thing a or two, Apollos Hester offered more than a few inspirational words on the importance of never giving up and staying positive

In a post match interview, wide receiver Hester revealed to Austin Time Warner Cable sports reporter Lauren Mickle just how the team managed to turn the game around.

After simply being asked how the team managed to comeback to win the game, a fired-up Hester launches into a two minute motivational speech. 

He said: 'Yeah they had us the first half, I'm not going to lie, they had us - we weren't defeated but they had us.

'But it took guts, it took an attitude - that's all it takes, that's all it takes to be successful is an attitude.'

He goes on to say: 'It's an amazing feeling when you truly believe that you're going to be successful, regardless of the situation, regardless of the scoreboard, you're going to be successful because you put in all the time, all the effort, all the hard work and you know it's going to pay off.

'And if it doesn't pay off you continue to give God the glory, if you lose the game you continue to get each other's back and that's what we realised - win or lose we were going to be alright and it was going to be ok, we were going to keep smiling. It was awesome.'

The NFL has been rocked by a number of scandals in recent months.

It was criticised last week by the White House over its recent spate of child and domestic abuse scandals.

An official said in D.C. on Thursday that the football league must 'get a handle' on its widespread issues of violence and have a message of 'zero tolerance'.

During a briefing on an awareness campaign about sexual assaults on college campuses, an official said the NFL had an 'obligation' to the U.S. and its millions of young fans to properly discipline those involved in abuse.

Critics have been calling for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation over his handling of domestic abuses incidents involving Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Jonathan Dwyer.
