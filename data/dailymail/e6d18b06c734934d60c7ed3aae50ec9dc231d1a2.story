Manny Pacquiao used to regularly knock out Amir Khan in sparring, trainer Freddie Roach has revealed. 

The two boxers both trained together at Roach's Wild Card gym in Los Angeles and Khan would often end up on the mat as a result of Pacquiao concussive one-punch power. 

‘Manny frequently put Amir on the floor, knocking him cold four or five times,' Roach revealed for the first time.  

Since those KO's were inflicted with gloves more thickly padded than those used in actual fights and Pacquiao is as fast as Khan, Roach also poured cold water over the idea of the pair meeting.

‘There’s no point Manny fighting Amir. The reality is that it’s no big fight,' said Roach, who will advise Hall of Fame promoter Bob Arum against taking Pacquiao to London ‘for a non-fight’. 

Khan - who left Roach to train with Virgil Hunter after losing his world titles in 2012 - will fight Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on December 7.

The Bolton man is hoping victory will then put him at the front of the queue to face Floyd Mayweather next year. Should Mayweather again not take the fight, then Khan has suggested PacMan as an alternative opponent.

But Roach believes Khan will end up disappointed on both counts as the Mayweather fight will not happen. 

Roach said: ‘It’s not going to happen. Floyd knows that Amir’s speed would trouble him. He is too careful with his choice of opponents to take that risk.'

Pacquiao’s defends his  world welterweight title this weekend against New York’s undefeated light-welter champion Chris Algieri in Macau. 

Pacquiao v Algieri will be televised live in Britain on BoxNation late Saturday night.
