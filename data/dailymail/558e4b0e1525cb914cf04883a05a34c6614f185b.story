'Not the answer': Locking up more criminals is a ‘sign of failure’ Nick Clegg, pictured, will say

Locking up more criminals is a ‘sign of failure’ Nick Clegg will say today.

The Lib Dem leader will use a speech to insist that prison is ‘not the answer’ for many offenders and will outline reforms to cut the number of women, people with mental health problems and drug users behind bars.

He will call for greater use of tagging and community service, adding: ‘Simply locking up more and more people is not a sign of success, it’s a sign of failure.’

Mr Clegg will say ‘dangerous, serial criminals’ should go to jail, but that for ‘vulnerable women, addicts and people with mental health problems, prison isn’t working’. 

He will add: ‘There are more than 85,000 people in prison in England and Wales today. In 1994, there were fewer than 49,000.

‘I don’t believe there are 36,000 more dangerous people now than then. We have not become a more vicious or sinister society.’

He will say: ‘Simply locking up more and more people is not a sign of success it’s a sign of failure.’

The speech will be seen as a strong indication that the Lib Dems will seek to slash the prison population if they end up in a new coalition government after the election.

Last year, Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes said he wanted to abolish jail sentences of less than a year.

Mr Clegg will also say the Youth Justice Board – which handles offenders aged up to 18 – should be extended so it deals with all offenders up to the age of 21.

But this will raise fears that more young adult offenders will be let out on the streets or given reprimands or other ‘soft’ punishments instead of being locked up.

Last night, a Tory source said one of the reasons for the rise in the prison population recently is the growing number of convicted sex offenders.

The source said: ‘Surely the Lib Dems wouldn’t say they should be anywhere else but behind bars?’

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘Under this Government, crime is down and our communities are safer. If we have to send more people to prison to achieve that, so be it.

‘Prison works – I’m clear about that. But we also have a duty to make sure it works better at rehabilitating offenders so that don’t keep coming back time and again.’

Mr Clegg will say fewer women, people with mental health problems and drug users should be jailed, and complain that they are being ‘crammed like sardines into crowded prisons’ (file image)

Mr Clegg will say fewer women, people with mental health problems and drug users should be jailed, and complain that they are being ‘crammed like sardines into crowded prisons’.

He will say: ‘Dangerous, serial criminals’ should go to jail, but that for ‘vulnerable women, addicts and people with mental health problems prison isn’t working.

‘We want to end the revolving door that sees offenders leave prison with no help and no hope, only to return to their cell a few weeks later.

‘And if your only crime is possession of drugs for personal use, we want to see you in treatment or education, not a prison cell’. Mr Clegg will insist that his proposed reforms will ‘make us safer’.

Last year, Mr Hughes said there should be a legal presumption that no-one should go to jail for less than 12 months, and instead criminals should be given community or suspended sentences.

That would mean 60,000 fewer criminals going to prison every year – including thousands of violent thugs, burglars, sex attackers and robbers.

Over time, it would lead to the halving of the current prison population of nearly 85,000, leaving tens of thousands of repeat criminals on the streets instead of behind bars.
