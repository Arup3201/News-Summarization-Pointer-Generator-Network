It can take considerable willpower and determination to give up the booze for a year. But, naturally, Carol Vorderman has it all figured out.

The 53-year-old, who came to fame doing the numbers game on Countdown for 26 years, yesterday showed off what a success her alcohol ban has been.

Appearing at the Lord of The Dance gala night on Wednesday she displayed her new slimline figure in a red lace dress and a thinner, smoother face.

At the end of last year, Miss Vorderman, vowed to give up alcohol in a bid to drop back down to a size 10 as she prepares for a solo flight round the world.

She said at the time: ‘I have decided that I am giving up alcohol for the whole year. I gave it up from December 29 as I thought I wanted to drink next New Year’s Eve.

'Last year I probably put on a stone or so, not that I weigh myself. I just want to be healthy.’

According to Sioned Quirke, spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, it is no surprise that cutting out alcohol has been so effective in helping Miss Vorderman lose weight – alcohol is high in calories and by cutting it out Miss Vorderman has created a calorie deficit.

The twice-divorced Miss Vorderman, who is currently dating former Red Arrows Squadron Leader Graham Duff , 39, has lost the weight in time for a demanding few months as, having qualified as a pilot last year, she is preparing to fly around the world solo.

Last night a spokesman for Miss Vorderman did not respond to a request for a comment.

Cutting out alcohol is an almost guaranteed method of losing weight, according to The Association of British Dieticians (BDA).

As
 Miss Vorderman’s svelte figure testifies, a dry lifestyle can help 
shift the pounds quickly and, says Sioned Quirke a spokesman for the 
BDA, it’s easy to understand way.

She
 said: ‘It’s a simple calorie deficit because alcohol tends to be very 
high in calories. So, depending on what exactly it drinks, it can 
significantly contribute to your daily calorie intake.

‘So
 a lot of people, if they go out on a Friday or Saturday night, can 
easily drink their way through a day’s worth of calories. If somebody 
wants to cut down or cut out alcohol, it would have a big impact on 
their weight.’

A key problem
 with alcohol is that is provides ‘empty calories’ void of nutrients 
but, Mrs Quirke explains, by cutting down drinking, a person makes room 
for nutrient rich calories.

However,
 she is keen to stress that while reducing alcohol intake is a ‘great 
first step’, for people who are battling with their weight there are 
often other issues to deal with.

She
 said: ‘It depends what the problem was in the first place, for the 
majority of people who are overweight, it’s not just one thing causing 
that. It’s often a combination of alcohol, portion sizes and food 
choice.

‘Cutting down on 
alcohol is a great first step, we know for a fact that it will help you 
lose weight depending on how much you cut down.’
