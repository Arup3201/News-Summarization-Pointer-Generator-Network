A teenager stabbed his mother before cutting off his own penis after he was believed to have taken party drug mephedrone, commonly known as meow meow.

The 19-year-old student hacked at his private parts with a knife after attacking his mother at their family home, it was claimed.

He was discovered hanging out of a bedroom window, blood gushing from his groin after his terrified mother called emergency services to the house in Haywards Heath, West Sussex.

Both he and his 46-year-old mother, neither of whom have been named, were rushed to hospital by ambulance with injuries described as life threatening after the attack on December 29, according to the Mirror.

Yesterday she was described as being in a stable condition at the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton.

Surgeons at University College London hospital are thought to have re-attached the teenager's penis, and his condition was also described as stable.

He is believed to have taken mephedrone, a former so-called legal high also known as M-Cat which was outlawed in 2010, before the attack.

A family friend told the Mirror that the usually bright teenager had started experimenting with drugs, and had returned to his family home for his Christmas break from university.

'He had come home from university for 
Christmas. 'It looks like he took mephedrone and completely flipped out 
attacking his mum and then himself,' said the source.

'When the police arrived they found him hanging from a window and then discovered he had cut off his penis.'

Sussex Police have been investigating an allegation of assault on the mother, and have said that officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

It is believed that least one person a week dies after taking party drug mephedrone, which until 2010 was legal

It is believed that least one person a week dies after taking party drug mephedrone, which until 2010 was legal.

It is now a class B drug and is illegal to sell and possess in the UK.

The drug, which is chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa, became popular among clubbers as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets.

Despite the dangers the drug, known as 
'plant food' or 'meow meow', has been hugely popular because of its 
cheapness and easy availability.

The effects of the substance have been likened to a combination of MDMA, amphetamine and cocaine. It is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy, but with the short-lived hit of a line of coke.

However, it can also cause anxiety and paranoia.

Other side-effects include headaches, palpitations, nausea, high blood pressure, a burning throat, nose bleeds and purple joints, especially the knees and hands.
