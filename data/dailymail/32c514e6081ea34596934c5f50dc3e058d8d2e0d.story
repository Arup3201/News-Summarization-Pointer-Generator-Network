Alan Pardew has tipped the ‘fabulous’ Harry Kane for an England call-up.

The Newcastle boss takes on Kane and Tottenham at White Hart Lane in Wednesday’s Capital One Cup quarter-final.

And Pardew admits he is a big fan of the 21-year-old, who scored his 11th of the season and ran a staggering 8.2 miles during Sunday’s 2-1 win at Swansea.

‘I think he is fabulous,’ said the Newcastle manager when asked about the in-form forward.

‘I watched him on Sunday and when you have got an English striker who can do 13km at pace and have the quality and technical ability in the box, Roy Hodgson should count himself very lucky.’

Pardew, meanwhile, believes the game could go the distance with the tie having to be settled on the night.

‘I do think we are two of the fittest sides in the division, so if it goes to extra-time – which is a possibility – I think we are both armed for that,’ he said.

‘I think they’ll find that we are pretty good ourselves in terms of fitness. Most of our goals are second half too because our fitness levels are very high.

‘So we are looking forward to it. We are excited to be in it. There are some good teams in the competition, which goes to show the standard it has this year.’
