Mandy, 53, gives an honest but life-affirming account of the change of life. This week, she sets out to master her cravings for sweet food.

We are what we eat, so they say, and so I am eight parts chocolate and two parts Mini Cheddars.

I have to confess my appetite and sugar cravings have been hard to control since the menopause, so I jumped at the chance to meet Dr Marilyn Glenville, a leading expert in nutritional health for women.

New Year's resolution: Mandy is ignoring her sugar cravings and adopting healthier habits

Our meeting has galvanised me to adopt healthier habits. This will be the year of miso, chickpeas, lentils, beans, seeds, oily fish, berries, nuts, fruit and veg - all key foods, Dr Glenville says, at this stage of life. I'll also drink eight glasses of filtered water a day and take supplements including vitamins B, C and omega-3 fish oils. My body will become a temple, and cease to be a skip.

I'll never bring myself to eat soy or tofu (menopause-friendly foods), but I am set on giving up chocolate, crisps, cake, ready-meals, caffeine, sugar in drinks and Diet Coke.

Dr Glenville says middle-aged women also need exercise, seven to eight hours' sleep a night, stress control, some exposure to sunshine (for vitamin D to absorb calcium and aid bone growth) and to bring blood sugar under control by eating well.

She is reassuringly positive about the menopause, seeing it not as a medical condition, but a natural transition that moves women into a new stage of life.

She also reveals heartening news that we burn more than 50,000 calories a year doing household chores, equal to 57 hours of running.

For women like me who don't like the gym but do enjoy housework, this is music to my ears.

So many things during the menopause are outside our control, so it makes sense to act wisely when it comes to those we can control - such as what we eat and drink.

Here's to that. Here's to this year being the best yet.
