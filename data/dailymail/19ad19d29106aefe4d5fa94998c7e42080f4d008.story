Alistair Darling today accused defeated SNP leader Alex Salmond of having ‘lost the plot’ for claiming Scotland could declare independence without a referendum

The former Better Together chairman said Mr Salmond had not been able to accept last week’s crushing rejection of independence. It came after Mr Salmond claimed ‘a referendum is only one of a number of routes’ to independence.

But addressing the Labour Party conference in Manchester today, Mr Darling said: ‘Apparently, the First Minister of Scotland said today while he'd lost the referendum, never mind, he might be able to seize power some other way.’

He added: ‘I just say to Mr Alex Salmond - you lost the argument, you lost the referendum, you've lost office, and now you've lost the plot. The people of Scotland are sovereign and the people of Scotland have said “no thanks” to separation and you must accept that result.’

Former Chancellor Alistair Darling, who led the campaign against independence, said Alex Salmond had 'lost the plot'

Mr Darling’s remarks came as Labour leader Ed Miliband snubbed Gordon Brown’s role in helping turn around the ‘No’ to independence campaign after publicly thanking every major political figure who fought for the Union – apart from the former Prime Minister.

Mr Brown’s intervention– bringing together the main Westminster political leaders to sign a joint ‘vow’ promising new powers for Scotland – has been hailed across the political divide.

Even Mr Salmond said the No campaign’s last minute promise of more powers for Holyrood had swayed voters.

But the outgoing First Minister, who dramatically announced he was stepping down from the job on Friday, has accused David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband of reneging on their word.

Mr Salmond said despite last week’s referendum defeat the ‘writing is on the wall’ for the Union. Mr Salmond said: ‘I think the destination is pretty certain, we are only now debating the timescale and the method.’

Interviewed yesterday on Sky News, Mr Salmond said: ‘There are a whole range of ways Scotland can improve its position in pursuit of Scottish independence.’

He added: ‘I think referendums are great, they have been my policy and even I have been surprised by an 85 per cent poll and the degree of public engagement, but of course for many years there was a “gradualist” attitude to independence.

‘That is to say you establish a parliament, you establish successfully more powers until you have a situation where you’re independent in all but name and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent. Many countries have proceeded through that route.

‘There is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well - so a referendum is only one of a number of routes.

‘I think it’s the best route incidentally, that’s always been my opinion but my opinion is only one of many.’

Outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that Scotland could become independent without a referendum

Mr Salmond's remarks came amid mounting nationalist fury over the perception that Westminster was wobbling over honouring its promise to devolve more powers to Scotland.

The three main Westminster party leaders made a ‘vow’ to Scottish voters that new powers over tax, welfare and spending would be transferred to Edinburgh.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there could be a vote in the Commons on the proposals by March next year.

He said: 'Of course, the Parliamentary timetable is not in Labour's hands. I would like to see a Second Reading of the Bill by Easter but we will seek to ensure that it is brought in at the latest in the first legislative week of the new Parliament in June.'

But the Prime Minister shocked Westminster on Friday morning – just hours after the result was announced – by revealing that any new devolution of powers to Scotland would have to go hand in hand with ‘English votes for English laws’.

Mr Cameron’s demand sparked an angry backlash from Labour MPs – with Ed Miliband accusing the Prime Minister of playing politics with Westminster’s pledge to transfer powers to Scotland.

The Prime Minister has insisted that the timetable for further devolution would be met.
