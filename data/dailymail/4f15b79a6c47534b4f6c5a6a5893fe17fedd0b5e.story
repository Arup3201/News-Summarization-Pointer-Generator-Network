Planning on stealing someone else's partner?

You might want to rethink that in the light of new research.

While 'mate poaching' is incredibly common, three separate studies examined whether luring someone away from another results in a healthy, long-term relationship.

Tracey says that if you've got your eyes on someone who is spoken for you could be in for a bumpy relationship

The answer in a nutshell is no.

Poached partners tend to be in more dysfunctional relationships, make less reliable mates and are less satisfied and committed than people who were single and available when you met.

They're also (surprise, surprise) more likely to cheat and had more narcissistic traits.

Not quite such an attractive option after all.

What astounds me, is that people ever thought it was.

I never quite believe it when married guys claim they get hit on far more frequently when sporting a wedding ring, than without. (Is this really true?)

If someone is already taken - and by that I mean dating, living with or married to someone else - surely that not only makes them off limits but far less appealing.

Not wanting to point out the obvious but how can you trust someone who left someone else for you?

Unsurprisingly poached partners are more likely to be repeat cheats, a new study has shown

Poached partner/affair-inspired relationships are nearly always riddled with insecurity and suspicion - for good reason.

If you stole them, you know they're capable of cheating because they've done it with you.

You've been there when they've claimed to be somewhere innocent, one hand holding their mobile and the other sliding up your thigh.

So when they call to tell you they're working late, your first thought is 'Are they really? What if they're doing that to me'

It's a lose-lose situation that doesn't work on either side: whether you're the person doing the stealing or the one being stolen.

'Poaching' is often done by people with low self-esteem. Taking someone else's partner 'proves' they are attractive, sexy and loveable after all.

Tracey doesn't believe the saying 'you can't help who you fall in love with' and says that we can control our feelings 

Trouble is, that newfound confidence and security quickly drains away once the high of hooking them wears off - so they set off in search of another target, in search of another high.

Sometimes leaving the person they tempted (who isn't in the habit of leaving for pastures new), staring bewildered at a ravaged life - shattered marriage, devastated children and nothing to show for it but being made to look like an idiot.

I'm aware (and know personally) of cases where women and men have fallen for other people's partners, tried to fight the attraction but can't, been genuinely remorseful and years later, are still together and happy.

But I still don't believe it when people say 'You can't help who you fall in love with'.

You can.

We all know, pretty early on, when we're attracted to someone.

If that someone happens to be out of bounds (attached, a boss, your best friend's boyfriend), the decent thing to do is recognise there is an attraction and avoid circumstances which would allow it to develop.

This means not going for drinks after work when that unfairly sexy married man is part of the group; opting out of the friendly invitation to 'pop out for a coffee' with the stunning married neighbour who always seems to have a few too many buttons undone.

We fall in lust and love (usually in that order) when we allow ourselves to.

It doesn't 'just happen', we've allowed it to happen.

It's like the booze-fuelled one-night-stand that 'meant nothing because we were both drunk'.

There's a point in the evening when you face yourself in the mirror, realise you're tipsy as hell, flirting like mad and can't be trusted to behave yourself.

Go straight back in and order another G & T and you might as well strip naked and do it right up there on the bar.

Who we fall in love with isn't out of our control, it's a choice.

Given the end result of hooking up with someone attached is a rubbish relationship with pathetic chances of success, isn't it more sensible to focus on those who are free and able to offer a real chance at happiness?
