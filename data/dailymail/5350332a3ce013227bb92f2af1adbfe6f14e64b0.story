The glamorous new lady of Longleat House has told of her regret that her father-in-law the Marquess of Bath chose to boycott her wedding two months ago.

Emma McQuiston, daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon, became Britain’s first black viscountess when she wed Lord Bath’s son and heir Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth.

But the eccentric Lord Bath, nicknamed the Loins of Longleat for his string of ‘wifelets’, stayed away from the nuptials after a furious  dispute over the moving of some of his famous erotic murals from the couple’s apartment within the stately home.

Regret: Emma McQuiston, has spoken of her regret that her father-in-law did not attend her wedding

‘It’s very sad he didn’t come to the 
wedding and that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point, but 
what can I do?’ Emma says in an exclusive interview with The Mail on 
Sunday’s You magazine today. ‘I hope in time it can all be resolved.’

In
 an attempt to assuage her father-in-law, she added: ‘I can assure you 
that none of the murals that were previously in place in our apartment 
have been “binned”.

‘The ones Ceawlin has moved have been very carefully preserved.’

Ceawlin,
 39, took over the running of Longleat and its safari park three years 
ago, and his engagement and marriage to Emma was welcomed by many as 
bringing a breath  of fresh air to the British aristocracy.

'Because we have this shared background, Ceawlin and I are 
very comfortable with each other'

But
 Emma, 27, whose mother is socialite Suzanna McQuiston and who has known
 her husband since she was four, insisted she would run a more 
old-fashioned household at Longleat than the bohemian lifestyle 
preferred by Lord Bath, 71. ‘I like the traditional way,’ she says, 
adding she prefers dressing up to dressing down.

It
 is believed Lady Bath, who spends most of her time in Paris, objected 
to Emma marrying her son at Longleat because she thought her too 
ambitious and keen to use Longleat to promote her career as a cook.

Undeterred,
 Emma insists that she would like to expand her healthy cookery ‘brand’.
 She jokes her new family name – Thynn – makes a neat fit with a career 
as a celebrity chef.

Emma 
also believes children will bring Longleat to life. ‘To maintain a place
 like this, you need to move with the times. It’s a special thing to be 
treasured, but it needs to have lots of youth and energy to be alive.

‘I
 guess I’m young to be getting married and thinking about babies but I 
feel, hopefully, I will be able  to get on with it as soon as it 
happens. I think I want two children – I say that now but I might get 
addicted and have, like, ten!’
