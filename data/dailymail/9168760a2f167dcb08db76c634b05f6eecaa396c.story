Arsenal are expected to make a fresh inquiry for Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho in the next 48 hours as Arsene Wenger attempts to bolster his midfield before the transfer deadline.

Arsenal will not pay the £37 million release clause in Carvalho’s contract, but Wenger wants to sign a defensive midfielder before the transfer window shuts.

If Sporting will accept £20m for the player, the deal could happen but Arsenal are also considering a move for Brazilian Luiz Gustavo.

The Wolfsburg midfielder has been on the club’s radar for some time but again they have been deterred by the £27m buyout clause in his contract.

Sven Bender and his twin brother Lars remain targets but Borussia Dortmund are unlikely to sell Sven, while Lars is still recovering from the thigh injury which ruled him out of the World Cup.
