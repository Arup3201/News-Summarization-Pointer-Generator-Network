Curvy women are preparing to take over the world of modelling.

A plus size magazine called SLiNK recently launched a global search for the next 'Plus sized supermodel' and they were inundated with more than 1,500 entries in the first week alone.

The publication is offering the winner of the competition a cover shoot and fashion spread in one of their upcoming issues, as well as modelling contracts with three agencies - MiLK management in the UK, Bella in Australia and Natural Models in the US.

SLiNK magazine recently launched a global search for the next 'Plus sized supermodel' and has so far received thousands of entries, including Samantha from America, left, Enitan from Los Angeles, centre, and Alyssa from Hawaii, right

Editor of SLiNK, Rivkie Baum said: 'So many agencies and brands are moving into the plus size market it is a really exciting area to be operating in and we all feel that this competition and one that is opened up to such a varied size range is a really positive thing for the industry.  

'The fact that the dress size range is so varied and open to women in so many countries means that this is one of the most open competitions in the modelling industry for a long time.'

Entrants must be within sizes 12-24 and ages 16-28, with a minimum height of 5ft 8ins. 

Rivkie is hoping that the success of the competition will encourage more countries to pay attention to plus size models in ad campaigns and magazine shoots. 

She said: 'I hope it reminds women that there are opportunities in modelling at a range of sizes, size 6 and 8 isn't the standard anymore, women can represent at a host of different sizes.

'We are so excited at the prospect of finding a global super star like the likes of Robyn Lawley or Candice Huffine.'
