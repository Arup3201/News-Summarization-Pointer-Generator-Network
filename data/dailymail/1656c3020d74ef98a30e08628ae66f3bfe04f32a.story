A multimillionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur has been convicted of manslaughter for fatally poisoning her eight-year-old autistic son in their luxury Manhattan hotel room four years ago.

Gigi Jordan, 53, avoided a murder conviction on Wednesday, meaning that she could serve as little as five years behind bars for killing her son, Jude Mirra, in February 2010. The maximum sentence she faces is 25 years in prison.

Following the six-week trial, jurors accepted her  defense that she had given her son a fatal dose of prescription drugs while in a state of 'extreme emotional 'disturbance', the New York Post reported.

She said she had feared that her ex-husband was going to kill her, leaving Jude in the custody of his biological father, who had sexually abused him. The boy's father has denied the claim.

Verdict: Gigi Jordan, in court in August 2011, has been convicted of manslaughter for killing her son in 2010. She said she took his life because she feared he would be left in the custody of his 'abusive' father

If she had been found guilty of murder, she would have faced 15 years to life behind bars.

Jordan was found lying among 5,819 pills and an empty bottle of Grey Goose vodka near her son’s corpse in the $2,300-a-night suite at the Peninsula Hotel on Fifth Avenue on February 5, 2010.

She told authorities she had given her son pills before the unsuccessful attempt to take her own life.

It also emerged that, as her son lay dying, she had calmly requested a bottle of water from the hotel, extended her stay and transferred $125,000 of money to another account.

Jude, who was non-verbal, was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, Jordan has said.

Prosecutors had claimed that she killed her son after realizing he would not get better.

Denial: In an interview with Dr Phil last week (pictured), Jordan said she killed her son because she felt 'incapable of protecting him'. She has said she feared her ex-husband was going to kill her

But Johnson has said that she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons.

She claimed  that her ex-husband and former business partner, Ray Mirra, wanted to kill her after she found out that he had stolen millions from her.

That would leave her son in the custody of his biological father, Emil Tzekov, whom she said had sexually abused him. 

Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime.

Prosecutors pointed out that both men had signed away their parental rights, meaning that they would never get custody of the boy, even if she did die. 

Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said.

One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008, but she was released within days.

Even though the second grader was unable to speak, Jordan has claimed it was actually her son who suggested they took their lives - by typing messages on her phone.

She claims he  urged her to use 'a lot of drugs' so he would die peacefully.

'I wish you do it soon,' she claims he wrote. 'I'm scare u r too chicken.'

Last week, as she awaited the verdict, Jordan spoke to Dr. Phil in an exclusive interview from Rikers Island, New York and said that she saw no option but to kill her son. 

'To run would only make me more vulnerable,' she said. 'I felt completely incapable of protecting him. Whether that was rational or not, I can't say, but I don't think I'm a cold blooded murderer.' 

Dr Phil asked: 'Who gave you the right to end this child's life?'

'I wanted him to be safe,' she responded. 'I didn't want him to be tortured anymore.'

And when asked if she has any regrets and she said simply: 'I would have done a better job of ending my own life.'
