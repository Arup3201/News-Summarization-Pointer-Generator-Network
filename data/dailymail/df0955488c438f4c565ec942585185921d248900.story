Every member of staff at a cash-strapped council has been given a share of a £852,000 bonus pot, it emerged today.

Suffolk County Council, which has over seen budget cuts of millions of pounds, signed off the £250 windfall for each of its 3,731 administration staff.

Critics condemned the move as ‘bonkers’ as council leaders claimed it would save money in the long run.

Bonus time: Tory-led Suffolk County Council signed off the £250 payments to staff despite losing millions in budget cuts

Full-time staff are in line for £250 with part-time workers receiving a payment on a pro-rata basis.

It was never discussed at an official council meeting but was agreed informally by cabinet members and senior managers.

The council claims the bonus was agreed, partly to compensate staff for the end of its incremental pay increases where workers used to get an additional pay rise for each year’s service.

Robert Oxley, the campaign manager for the Taxpayers Alliance, said: ‘It’s shocking that the council is paying out bonuses, regardless of what they want to try and call them.

‘It’s bonkers that the council acknowledges the financial pressures it faces yet still deems it sensible to hand already well paid staff a bonus and a pay rise.

‘The council needs to cut out wasteful and unnecessary spending so they can ease the pressure on hard pressed residents footing the local authority’s pay bill.’

Council leaders claimed the move will save move

Only officials working in the main administration will get the bonus, with specialists like teachers or firefighters left out.

Suffolk County Council leader Mark Bee said: ‘Making this one-off payment very much marks the end of incremental salary increases which can cost an authority of our size significant sums of money.

‘This payment is being made on a pro-rata basis. As the majority of our staff are part-time, they will not receive the full amount.

‘In the long run, the changes we are making to staff pay will save the authority money.’

However, Sandy Martin, the Labour leader on the council, said: ‘I am surprised that this was not on the agenda to be discussed before it was decided - especially as we are always hearing what a financial black hole we are staring into.

‘Quite honestly if there is this money available I would rather have seen it use to benefit the lowest-paid staff, to introduce the living wage.

‘While £250 is a good sum, it will not be that much for people on more than £25,000, but if this money was spent to lift the wages of those at the bottom it could have made a real difference - but there was no chance to discuss the decision.’

A spokesman for Suffolk County Council said: ‘This payment is in recognition of our employees’ on-going commitment to the authority during what continues to be a challenging time for local government.

‘It is also against the background of the removal of all incremental salary increases. Corporate single status staff will also receive a 1 per cent cost of living increase in their salary.

‘This is in line with a national agreement between unions and employers.’
