Children as young as two will start going to school under government plans to help working parents.

Education minister Liz Truss is writing to every council in England to suggest that school nurseries widen their intake to youngsters a year earlier.

As well as increasing access to childcare she also hopes the move will dramatically improve the academic ability of toddlers to give them a head start in their education.

Ministers are also asking schools to 
extend their opening hours to allow parents to leave their children 
there for up to ten hours a day.

The move would ease the childcare headache that leaves many parents relying on grandparents or childminders for up to four hours a day.

As part of the move, the Government will introduce legislation to remove red tape that previously put off schools from opening their doors to two-year-olds.

Ministers say it would open up tens of thousands more places as very few schools currently cater for the age group.

Miss Truss said: ‘Schools have excellent facilities. It is age-appropriate, so what you are doing with two-year-olds in terms of singing, reading stories, playing with paint is very different from what you do with a seven-year-old.

‘If you have a really high quality 
school nursery, children who are behind can catch up with their peers by
 the time they start school.’

The latest move comes after a Tory 
proposal to allow childminders to look after more children was blocked 
by the Lib Dems last year.

A shortage of affordable childcare is cited by many parents – most of them mothers – as the top reason for not returning to work.

Fees for nurseries have also soared by 30 per cent in the past three years, vastly outstripping wages.

The average cost of 25 hours a week in nursery for a child aged two or over for is £107 – and much higher in London.

But the Coalition as well as the previous Labour government have faced criticism for trying to march mothers back to work with little regard for the impact on children.

While full-time childcare such as nursery can help youngsters from deprived backgrounds from slipping behind once they reach school age, it can have the reverse effect on those from other backgrounds.

Yet it is middle class mothers the Government most wants to encourage back to work because of their potential to pay more in tax.

Mrs Truss will give 49 primary schools a grant of £10,000 each to determine the best way of educating two-year-olds.

The minister also wants parents to be able to choose how to spread their allocation of free childcare. Most state nurseries currently only offer up to three hours a day of care, forcing parents to top up their childcare elsewhere.

Miss Truss told the Telegraph: ‘Many parents would prefer longer days rather than five short bursts during the week.

‘If you’re working part-time, you could have two sessions of seven and a half hours, or three sessions of five hours. It gives much more flexibility.’

All three and four year-olds qualify for 15 hours free childcare every week.

The coalition has moved to extend it to the 40 per cent two-year-olds from the poorest backgrounds to get up to 15 free hours of 
nursery care a week by the end of this year. Families on higher incomes 
will have to pay.

A government-backed survey last week showed one in three working mothers would quit their jobs to raise their children if they could afford to. More than a quarter of parents also said they struggle to meet their childcare costs.

On average, families are paying out around £54 a week on nurseries, babysitters, childminders and after-school care.

The
 most expensive type of childcare was a nanny or au pair costing on 
average £202 a week, followed by a day nursery (£105 a week on average) 
and a nursery school (£86 on average).

The cheapest were breakfast clubs (£14 a week) and after-school activities (£22).

The
 poll found that 32 per cent of parents rated the affordability of local
 childcare as very or fairly good, while 29 per cent were unsure and 39 
per cent said it was very or fairly poor.

While
 almost half (49 per cent) of those surveyed said they found it easy or 
very easy to meet their childcare costs, a substantial minority - 27 per
 cent said it was difficult or very difficult.
