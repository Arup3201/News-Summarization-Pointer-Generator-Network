Usain Bolt has proven that he is not just the world's fastest sprinter, but that he also has the stamina to go the distance - at least when it comes to partying.

The Jamaican athlete spent Thursday night (and morning) doing the rounds in London, starting with dinner in Fitzrovia and on to some of the capital's hottest watering holes, before turning up at a South London dentist's surgery at 10am.

The 27-year-old sports star partied up a storm on several locations in the capital, leaving celebrity haunt Mahiki with two female friends at 3am, before making their way to members club Raffles in Chelsea.

The Social next door where he was spotted chatting to guests and 
dancing.

According
 to an eyewitness he left the bar with an unknown woman around midnight,
 before going to Mahiki - a favourite with all levels of fame, from X 
Factor rejects to royals.

The
 sprinter was the life of the party, posing for selfies with staff and 
guests and even jumping in behind the bar at the Dover Street tiki club,
 making cocktails for his friends.

Georgi Radev, manager of Mahiki, said: ‘'He was here all night. He was making his own cocktails – they were rum punch.'

Wild thing: The Jamaican star, who is dubbed the fasted runner in the world, appeared to have enjoyed his night out

Burger & Lobster - Restaurant, Fitzrovia

A restaurant group with six sites in London, famous for their incredible value for money lobsters and the queues for a seat at all the locations often snake out the doors. 

The Social - Bar, Fitzrovia

Music focused bar set up by a record company (Usain Bolt stumbled upon the popular Hip Hop Karaoke night) in Fitzrovia.

Mahiki - Nightclub, Mayfair

Legendary tiki venue, popular with A to Z-list celebrities who tend to emerge 'worse for wear' in the early hours, but also loved by Princes William (back in the day) and Harry. Famous for their guests, but also for their punch menu, featuring the £450 Armada Treasure Chest (£650 with Cristal), the £1,200 Queen Ann's Revenge and the £600 Jewel of the Seas.

Raffles - Exclusive members club

One of London's more exclusive members clubs where all photography is forbidden and you are likely to bump into Kings Road regulars such as the Made in Chelsea cast and James and Pippa Middleton.

He added: ‘He’s absolutely amazing, definitely one of the coolest most down to earth guys I’ve ever met.

‘He had a table but was up getting involved with everyone, dancing and making drinks.’

Mahiki's late night menu features their famous £150 Mahiki Treasure Chest, a rum punch topped with champagne indented for sharing.

However, there are also more exclusive libations, such as the £450 Armada Tresure Chest and the £1,200 Queen Ann's Revenge.

Mr Radev, 
33, said the Olympian had a large group of friends but was happy to pose
 for pictures with fans and dance the night away.

‘We’d love to have him back, it was great.’

Bolt emerged from Mahiki with a group of female friends just after 3am, but the night was not over for the sportsman.

After
 piling in to a taxi, the group headed off to exclusive members club 
Raffles on Kings Road - a favourite with the Made in Chelsea cast.

Dressed in an all-white ensemble, Usain appeared to be in high spirits as he took centre stage with his signature ‘archer’ pose - in front of flashing photographers.

He teamed 
his white T-shirt, which had the words ‘Please Comme the F*** down’ 
emblazoned across it, with matching skintight jeans and lace-up pumps.

Usain accessorised the look further with a designer white belt and a large statement watch.

It is not known how long Bolt stayed at Raffles, which closes at 5am, but as the sun rose over London, the man 
of the (early) hour was seen by Clapham South tube station at 8am, 
strolling with another unknown woman.

A short while later, just
 before 10am, Chris York – Social Media Editor at Huffington Post 
UK – met the sprinter in his dentist’s surgery on nearby Clapham High Street - still in the all-white ensemble.

It 
remains unclear how and why Bolt was there but one person at the scene 
said he did not appear to be there for an appointment.

Along with a picture, York tweeted: 'Just hanging out with #UsainBolt at the dentists. As you do.'

Meanwhile,
 the athlete recently teamed up with Italian footballer Mario Balotelli,
 golfers Rickie Fowler and Lexi Thompson, Manchester City striker Sergio
 Aguero and Brazilian football star Marta Vieira da Silva for a new 
campaign video for PUMA.

The advert 
shows Usain appear in a hot tub with a group of bikini-clad women, and 
where he calls on all troublemakers, adding: 'Obedience will be 
discouraged.' Along with a picture, he tweeted: ‘Calling all 
TroubleMakers!!!!! #foreverfaster #followInstinct @puma’

The
 campaign recognises various sportsmen with off-the-wall personalities; 
with the help tp promote PUMA's latest range of products. 

'We've
 always been known as a brand that takes risks and that's not going to 
change, Forever Faster clearly represents that,'said Adam Petrick, 
Global Marketing Director at PUMA.

'This is going to change the way we approach product design and innovation as well as how we market our brand.'
