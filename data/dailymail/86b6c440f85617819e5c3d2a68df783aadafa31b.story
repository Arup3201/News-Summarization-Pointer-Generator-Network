Larry Flynt, who is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his landmark First Amendment court case this month, has revealed he uses a penile implant to have sex and continues to engage in open relationships at 70 years of age.

The self-described ‘smut-peddler’ and the man behind the multi-million dollar Hustler empire, Flynt has been paralyzed from the waist down since being shot in 1978.

He has been married to his fifth wife – and former nurse - Liz Berrios since 1998 and says the implant is a fact of life for him.

‘Lots of men have them. There’s a little reservoir in the bottom part of your stomach, and you trigger it with a button inside your testicles that doesn’t show. Nothing shows,’ he told The Hollywood Reporter.

Flynt also admitted that he has slept with other woman during his current marriage, just as he did during his four previous ones.

'I wouldn’t be in a relationship that wasn’t open,' he insists, although he says his current wife doesn’t share the same feelings.

Flynt also admitted that he is estranged 
from four of his five children, because he claims they just wanted his 
money and weren’t prepared to show an interest in running his business.

However he maintains a special place in his heart for his third wife Althea, who was bisexual and died of AIDS in 1987.

'Althea was the love of my life,' said Flynt.

They met when the 17-year-old runaway started dancing in one of his 
clubs. They married in 1976 and remained married until her death in
1987. In the 1996 movie The People vs. Larry Flint, Althea was played by Courtney Love.

With a business making profits of over $100 million a year, Flynt is pretty hands off with the magazine that put him on the map, but he said he would be willing to pay Jennifer Aniston $1 million to $2 million to pose naked.

'You’d sell a ton of magazines with her doing porn,' he said.

Yet the porn king claims to have some morals and told the Reporter that he doesn’t enjoy the films of Quentin Tarantino because he find them too violent.

It is a quarter of a century since Flynt’s historic victory in the Supreme Court which is now taught in law schools and was the subject of a 1996 movie starring Woody Harrelson as Flynt.

In the late ’80s, televangelist Jerry Falwell sued Flynt for libel and the emotional distress caused by a Hustler cartoon that implied Falwell’s first sexual encounter was with his mother. He won in a lower court.

But on Feb. 24, 1988, the Supreme Court deemed that if a public figure could receive damages for distress, any kind of satire or parody would be impossible. The case, Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, is now taught in law schools.

Despite the heated case, Falwell and Flynt made amends soon afterwards and went on speaking engagements together.

‘I was sitting in my office and my secretary called me and said, “Reverend Jerry Falwell is in the lobby.” I said, “Send him in.” So he walked in the door and he held up both hands and said, "I surrender!" He sat down and we talked for about an hour, and then he asked me to go on a couple of speaking engagements with him, where we debated one another.'

Flint was also relatively polite about his rival in porn Hugh Hefner. 'I like him; he is kind of boring, but he is a gentleman,' said Flynt.

As well as his business, Flynt is also passionate about politics and is a Democrat.

During the 2012 presidential election campaign, Flynt took out full-page ads - in The Washington Post and USA Today - that offered up to $1 million for details of the GOP nominee Mitt Romney's 'unreleased tax returns' and 'offshore assets.'

Flynt also made the headlines late 
last year when he offered Republican senate candidate Richard Mourdock 
$1million to prove he has had 'conversations with God.'

The
bizarre challenge followed Mourdock's comment during a debate last 
October that even when babies are conceived during 'that horrible 
situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen.'

Flynt said in an open letter that among the evidence he would accept would be a 'verifiable transcript of [Mr Mourdock's] personal conversations with God; letters, email, text messages or videos from God.'

'I will accept for purposes 
of this reward any verifiable transcript of your personal conversations 
with God; letters, email, text messages or videos from God, or messages 
addressed to you from God transmitted by any third party, including the 
Republican National Committee or the Romney/Ryan campaign.

Flynt is estranged from four of his five children because he claims they just wanted his money

Flynt says he is currently targeting a prominent unnamed member of Congress who he says is in the closet about their sexuality

'I assume that you would not have made 
this statement unless you had been authorized by God.

'No one who 
believes in God would ever use the Almighty’s name in vain. That would 
be blasphemy,' Mr Flynt wrote.

'I am eager to receive your proof and pay my
$1 million reward to you.'

Also in 2012 Flynt offered $1 million to anyone with proof of 'an illicit sexual liaison' involving former Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry.

Flynt told The Hollywood Reporter that he is currently targeting 
another prominent member of Congress who he says is in the closet (he 
declined to name him).

'I’ve had an investigation going on for two 
years,' he said. 'We’re having trouble pinning him down, but this is one
guy I’d really like to get.'
