Two Massachusetts women are lucky to be alive after being attacked by a great white shark while kayaking, throwing them both into the water.

The women - both in their mid-twenties - said they saw 'at least 4 feet of (the shark's) head come out of the water' and bite one of their ocean kayaks.

The dramatic incident occurred just 100 yards from shire in Plymouth, south of Boston, on Wednesday afternoon.

Officials used the teeth marks left on the kayak to verify the shark was a great white.

Lucky escape: Kristin Orr and Ida Parker - both of Plymouth, Massachusetts - were attacked by a great white shark while kayaking just 100 yards from the shore on Wednesday

Deadly bite: This photo provided by Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries shows a hole in a kayak that, according to agency experts, was made Wednesday by a bite from a great white shark

Proof: The attack was confirmed based on tooth fragments and bite radius on the kayak

Terrifying: Ida Parker and Kristin Orr were rescued after a great white shark made huge holes in their kayak, tipping them out

'We were just talking and paddling. I 
look over to talk to her and it came completely out of the water and got
 the bottom of the boat and flipped her over and knocked my kayak 
completely over,' one of the women, Ida Parker, told WHDH.

'I saw at least four feet of its head.

'Four feet of it came up out of the water.'

Both
 Parker and her friend, Kirsten Orr - who had gone out on the water to 
look for seals - were left bobbing in the water not knowing what to do.

They decided to remain as still as possible and wait for help.

'The scariest part was sitting in the water thinking he was waiting, wondering where he was.,' Parker told

'You didn't know if he was under you or around you.'

'We were sitting in the water and she was sinking and I was flipped over holding onto the bottom of the kayak.

'It was petrifying waiting in that water for the harbormaster to come and not knowing if anybody would come get us.'

Usually calm: The women - both in their mid-twenties - were out looking for seals at Plymouth Beach when the incident occurred

Bite marks: The force of the shark hitting and biting the kayak pushed both women into the water

Overcome: Kristen Orr and Ida Parker said the most 'petrifying' part was bobbing in the water waiting for help to arrive

Fortunately a local on the sand heard the pair's screams and rushed into the water to help them after calling 911.

Both women escaped without injury.

However they lost a GoPro camera which they believe recorded some of the attack and hope it turns up so they have video of their lucky escape.

A spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Energy and Environmental Affairs, Kristi Selmi, told The Boston Globe there have been numerous shark sightings in the area this summer.

'Shark sightings have become a more common occurrence during the summer months due to an increasing population of grey seals in the area,' Selmi said.

Hundreds of beachgoers were ordered out of the water on August 25 when a great white shark was spotted at Duxbury Beach, according to the newspaper.
