Forget jumping around and playing the air guitar to Bon Jovi's Living On A Prayer, karaoke just got cool.

Putting a fresh twist on the traditionally cheesy sing-a-long, Hip Hop Karaoke is taking London's nightlife scene by storm.

One event, which takes place every Thursday at The Social in Soho, gives budding rappers the chance to channel their inner Missy Elliot and Notorious B.I.G.

Hot new night: Hip Hop Karaoke, which invites 
amateur rappers to the stage to perform in front of a cheering crowd is
hitting the mainstream

Akin to a scene in 8 Mile, which sees Eminem take to the stage and bust out a fierce rendition of Lose Yourself, Hip Hop Karaoke really is the place to lose yourself in the music.

Describing the night on its website, it says: 'We let you get on the mic and act out your rap fantasies to the fullest.

'Whether that includes teaming up with friends to rock through a Wu-Tang jam, living the lyrical high life like Jay-Z or Drake, bawsin it like Rick Ross, celebrating summertime with The Fresh Prince or acting all crazy like Nicki Minaj.'

The £5 night is hosted by a peppy gold jacket-clad man who goes by the name of Bobby Champagne junior (think a young Tim Westwood).

He enforces a 'no booing' rule so everyone can feel like Lil Wayne (even if they don't sound like him).

Lose yourself in the music: Fancy channeling your inner Eminem? There's no better place

In between the live acts, the rammed crowd get low to tunes from Nars, Busta Rhymes and Fat Joe.

Their weekly event has become a 
roadblock, with wannabee rappers often queuing for hours to get in.

They have also taken it on the road to 
Glastonbury, V Festival, Bestival, Isle Of Wight Festival, hosted 
parties and seen the likes of Wretch 32 and Daniel Bedingfield take to the stage.

Catherine Smith, a first time rapper, said: 'I got up on stage and felt exhilarated as I sang Eminem in front of hundreds of cheering people.

'It's the perfect way to build your confidence because everyone is so accepting and encouraging.'

Intimate: The £5 takes place at The Social, just behind Oxford Street, and is packed out every Thursday

Missy Elliot wannabee, Lindsay Cleland, added: 'I've always rapped Missy Elliot Get Your Freak On in front of my bathroom mirror but I braved the stage and had the time of my life.'

Rob Pursey, DJ, Founder and Promoter of Hip Hop Karaoke, told MailOnline: 'For me the best thing about Hip Hop Karaoke is the inclusive and communal nature of the event, which we promote above all things, and the fact that whether you own only a couple of rap albums or are a fully committed hip hop fan you can get on that stage and feel like a real rap performer for those three or four minutes.'

If hip hop isn't your vibe but you still like to let loose on the mic, Scala is playing host to three of the  live Karaoke events – Rockaoke, Hip Hop Karaoke and SoulBrew Karaoke – who are joining forces for what they call Ultimate Karaoke.

The three genres will meet on stage for the first time, ready for members of the crowd to perform anything from Bon Jovi to Busta Rhymes, Deep Purple to Diana Ross.
