Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe.

Unsurprisingly, on Tuesday the Spanish media have focused their attention on Real Madrid's clash with Liverpool, during which Cristiano Ronaldo could break Raul's Champions League goal-scoring record.

One strike against the Reds would pull Ronaldo level with Real legend Raul, while a brace would be enough to ensure he holds the record outright by himself.

AS also focus on Ronaldo, who can equal or even better the Real Madrid legend's Champions League goal-scoring record of 71 by scoring against Liverpool, with the headline: 'Cristiano - Objective Raul'

In anticipation of the record being equalled or broken, Marca lead with the headline 'The Magnificent "7"' accompanied by a mocked-up picture of Ronaldo and Raul embracing.

AS on the other hand have the headline 'Cristiano - Objective Raul'.

Interestingly, AS also expect 4,000 Liverpool supporters to flood on Madrid - including 1,000 without tickets.

Mundo Deportivo have chosen not to focus attention on Ronaldo, instead leading with a piece on Barcelona's Luis Suarez.

Meanwhile, La Gazetta dello Sport claims there is a 'crisis' with the 'Flops of Milan' and refers to both Inter Milan and AC Milan's current plight, with the two sides each losing 2-0 last weekend

'Flops of Milan' is the headline on the front page of La Gazetta dello Sport, who focus on Inter Milan and AC Milan's appalling run this season.

Calling it a 'crisis' unseen in 20 years, they describe how AC - whose summer signing Fernando Torres has scored just once - are in seventh and Inter back in ninth in Serie A.

Inter succumbed to a 2-0 defeat at Parma last weekend while AC lost by the same scoreline against Palermo at the San Siro.

In France meanwhile, L'Equipe wonder if Paris Saint-Germain can join the likes of Bayern Munich and Chelsea in the fight to wrestle the Champions League away from Real this season.

Finally, in Portugal, Abola's headline is 'As if it were a final' as they preview Benfica's home clash with Monaco.

The Portuguese side sit bottom of Champions League Group C with just a point, and a loss to Monaco would all but guarantee their elimination from the competition.

Record also lead on the same theme, their headline reading 'They can withstand' in reference to Jorge Jesus' side's huge match.
