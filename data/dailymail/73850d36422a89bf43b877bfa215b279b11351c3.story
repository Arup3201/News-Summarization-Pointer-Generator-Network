Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho believes his side can learn from their 2-1 defeat by France on Sunday.

Monaco defender Carvalho replaced Bruno Alves to take part in Fernando Santos' first game in charge of Portugal since replacing Paulo Bento.

However he was unable to prevent his side from losing their friendly encounter at the Stade de France as they were outdone by goals from Karim Benzema and Paul Pogba.

Speaking to FourFourTwo after the match, Carvalho said: 'I think it was an important game for us as we came into it off a defeat [to Albania] in our last match.

'Now we have started something new and I think we are going to build up our confidence and improve.

'Denmark is an important game for us to try to win. I think everyone in our squad felt this was a good test and of course we were up against some great players, so that will help us to do well in Denmark.'

Portugal will be hoping they can get back to winning ways when they face Denmark on Tuesday.
