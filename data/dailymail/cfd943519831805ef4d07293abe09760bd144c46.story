The Oregon owners of a 22-pound housecat that trapped them in their bedroom after attacking their baby say they're not giving up on their pet and are getting him medical attention and therapy.

Two days after police arrived to subdue the four-year-old part-Himalayan cat, owner Lee Palmer of Portland said he's taking the feline to a veterinarian. A pet psychologist also is due at the house to see the cat, named Lux.

‘We're not getting rid of him right now,’ Palmer said. ‘He's been part of our family for a long time.’

Palmer says the animal attacked his seven-month-old son, Jesse, after the baby pulled its tail. The child suffered a few scratches on the forehead.

On the 911 call, Palmer tells the dispatcher he kicked the cat ‘in the rear’ to protect his child.

Palmer says the animal then ‘just went off over the edge’ - leading Palmer and his girlfriend to barricade themselves, their baby and the family dog in the bedroom for safety.

The cat can be heard screeching in the background of the call as Palmer says in a panicked voice: ‘He's charging us. He's at our bedroom door.’

Palmer also tells the dispatcher the cat has been violent in the past. He said the family has had proposals from people wanting to adopt Lux, but the family is not taking them up on it.

Like butter wouldn't melt: Lux is a Himalayan with a 'history of violence,' say his owners. They were forced to call 911 on Sunday after Lux attacked their baby and then cornered them in a bedroom

As they cowered in the room, Palmer called 911 to report his 'very particular emergency'.

'I kicked the cat in the rear, and it has gone over the edge,' he can be heard saying in a recording of the call. 'He's trying to attack us. He's very, very, very, very hostile. He's at our door; he's charging us.'

Meanwhile, the four-year-old cat blocked the bedroom doorway and could be heard on the 911 call screeching loudly, his partner Teresa Simpson said.

'When I leave out the bedroom to let the police in, I'm going to have to fight this cat,' Palmer told the dispatcher. 'Tell them to be careful - the police.'

The dispatcher, having never encountered such a situation before, asks her supervisor whether or not police can be sent for an angry cat. The supervisor answers in the affirmative.

Tough decision: The family has had Lux for a number of years and are so reluctant to part with him that he us getting another chance

'He said that the cat has a history of violence,' Simpson said, referring to the father speaking to the 911 operator.

When
 officers arrived and entered the house, they saw the cat scurry into 
the kitchen. After it scrambled atop the refrigerator, officers snared 
it and put it in a travel-style kennel, Simpson said.

'Officers were able to outwit the high-strung Himalayan,' Simpson concluded.

Safely
 behind bars, the cat was left in the custody of the family, Simpson 
said. It was not clear what they intend to do with the animal, he said.

'We are debating what to do,' Palmer told the Oregonian on Monday. 'We definitely want to keep (the cat) away from the baby and keep an eye on his behavior.'

On Tuesday, Palmer defended his decision to kick the cat on his Facebook page.

Emergency: Lee Palmer and his girlfriend were too fearful of their cat Lux to emerge from their bedroom

'The
 cat is very loved that is why he is still here,' he wrote. 'We had the 
option to let the animal control take him but decided to give him a 
chance.

'The
 cat is territorial and can swat randomly and he swatted my son in the 
face - could have gotten him in the eye. I'm a very caring, hard-working
 father that cares about my son... I did kick him away from my son - you
 would too.'

The baby 
suffered some scratches to the face but was not seriously hurt and 
Palmer told dispatchers his son was not in need of any medical 
attention, Simpson said.

While
 cases of out-of-control dogs are relatively common, Simpson said, he 
could not recall in his 20 years with the Portland police a similarly 
ferocious feline.
