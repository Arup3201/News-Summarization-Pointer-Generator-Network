I remember sitting in our annual captains’ conference at Lord’s each year with the likes of Steve Waugh, Stephen Fleming and Brian Lara, and almost to a man we would say that the sport needed to be careful about the amount of cricket we were playing.

The International Cricket Council would blame the national boards for scheduling too many matches, and then the boards would blame the ICC for setting up the Future Tours Programme. The diaries were brimming with games. And it’s only got worse since I retired.

It’s no great surprise to me that England are playing 17 Tests in nine months from April 2015 to January 2016. Equally, we shouldn’t be surprised if the players themselves are too exhausted to complete the course.

Burn out? Stuart Broad (R) is being forced to endure a Test against India with a suspect knee

Barmy army! England fans paying £85 a ticket will be disappointed if stars are rested

Physically, it’s the fast bowlers who suffer. Look at Stuart Broad right now, hobbling through a series against India with a dodgy knee. It’s just not practical to ask these blokes to bowl consistently at 90mph — yet that’s what crowds want to see.

The sight of Mitchell Johnson steaming in over the winter was amazing, no matter which side you were supporting. I just worry we’ll see it less and less. What we’ll get is a watered-down version of the real thing.

Mentally, it’s the batsmen who can get into difficulties. Look at poor old Jonathan Trott.

When you’re on the road all the time and are struggling for scores, the loneliness of your hotel room can be a dangerous place to be.

Mind games: Jonathan Trott struggled with a stress related illness while on the Ashes tour of Australia

Don’t get me wrong. We all make a good living out of the game. And while that happens no-one is going to stand up and say enough is enough. They’ll just make their money more quickly and retire earlier, before riding off into the IPL sunset.

But there’s another factor we should consider: the fans. If I’ve paid £85 months in advance for a day’s Test cricket, then find out in the week before the game that England are resting Jimmy Anderson, I wouldn’t be very amused.

It’s all to do with greed. It’s punishing for those playing the game, and unfair on those paying to watch it.
