Two men who were part of a gang which shot at a police helicopter as well as officers on the ground 
during last year’s riots have been jailed. 

Beniha Laing, 29, and Wesley Gray, 
27, organised a mob which fired at the West Midlands Police helicopter after
luring officers to the scene by firebombing a pub. 

They used violence that began in London after the police shooting of Mark Duggan and then flared around the country as an excuse to target police officers in a deliberate attempt to destroy the aircraft.

The violence erupted in Birmingham when officers were forced to run for safety as windows behind 
them were shattered by bullets being fired from four different guns.

Jailed: Beniha Laing, 29, and Wesley Gray, 27, organised a mob who fired at the West Midlands Police helicopter after luring cops to the scene by firebombing a pub

Members of the gang discharged at least 12 shots at officers and shocking CCTV footage then shows others taking aim and firing a gun at the force helicopter on two occasions

Birmingham Crown Court heard how the men planned and orchestrated an attack on police at the height of the disorder in the city when they knew that police resources were stretched

Police had been dispatched to deal 
with reports of a fire at the Bartons Arms pub in the Newtown area of 
the city on August 9 last year. 

When the officers arrived on the 
scene they were faced with a group of masked and hooded youths armed 
with bats and various items of furniture taken from the pub - which they
used to barricade the High Street.

Members of the gang discharged at 
least 12 shots at officers and shocking CCTV footage then shows others 
taking aim and firing a gun at the force helicopter on two occasions.

Birmingham Crown Court heard how the 
men planned and orchestrated an attack on police at the height of the 
disorder in the city when they knew that police resources were 
stretched. 

It was finally brought to an end when firearms officers attended the scene and a number of arrests were made.

In June this year six men - aged 
between 20 and 27 - were jailed for a total of 124 years after they were
convicted of riot, arson and firearms possession with intent to 
endanger life.

Evidence: A St Etienne revolver and ammunition which was also identified as one of the other weapons used during the riot

Bullets: Ammunition that was seized by police. Birmingham Crown Court heard how the men planned and orchestrated an attack on police at the height of the disorder in the city when they knew that police resources were stretched

Uncovered: A bag containing the weapon was handed to Laing by Nadeen Banbury near to Burlington Street, Birmingham

Uncovered: A Fegarmy 9mm pistol that was found at the address of Laing's friend Janine Francis

And today Laing and Gray were found 
guilty of similar riot and firearms offences following a three week 
trial - and were jailed for 35 and 29 years respectively.

Following the case, Detective 
Inspector Andy Bannister, from West Midlands Police, said: 'On the night
of 9 August, approximately 40 people were on the streets near the 
Bartons Arms pub.

'They had planned an orchestrated attack on police officers who were deployed on the night. 

'A number of individuals are already 
serving lengthy sentences following a trial earlier this year regarding 
this investigation and today we have secured further convictions against
other people involved.

'Despite the culmination of this trial, the work does not stop here.

Catch: Fire engulfs the Barton Arms Pub, Birmingham. The gang luring police to the scene by firebombing the premises

Attack: When the officers arrived on the scene they were faced with a group of masked and hooded youths armed with bats and various items of furniture taken from the pub

Jailed: Janine Francis, 25, and Nadeen Banbury, 25, were found guilty of possession of a weapon and ammunition. Francis was jailed for seven and a half years while Banbury was sentenced to five years in prison

'We are continuing to look at using 
different methods of intervention to address the behaviour of other 
individuals who were part of that group on that August night.'

The court heard on 7 October, 2011 a 
Fegarmy 9mm pistol and ammunition was found at the address of Laing’s 
friend Janine Francis, 25, following a planned police operation.

The firearm was examined revealing 
that it was one of the weapons used on the evening of the attack and 
also Gray’s DNA was found on the gun.

A second firearm was seized on 19 
October when Laing was handed a bag by Nadeen Banbury, 25, which 
contained a St Etienne revolver and ammunition which was also identified
as one of the other weapons used that August night.

Jailed:  Nicholas Francis, 26, left,  was jailed for 30 years while co-defendant Tyrone Laidley, 20, right, received 20 years

Guilty: Jermaine Lewis, 27, was jailed for 23 years for shooting at police officers during last summer's riots in Birmingham while Wayne Collins, 20, received an 18 year sentence

Threat: Renardo Farell, 20, was sentenced to 18 years while Amirul Rehman, 17, was given 12 years. The gang lured officers into the area by firebombing a pub and even shot at a police helicopter

Yesterday the two women were found guilty of possession of a weapon and ammunition.

Francis was jailed for seven and a half years while Banbury was sentenced to five years in prison.

Neil Fielding, special casework 
lawyer from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) Complex 
Casework Unit, said: 'These individuals are dangerous men - supported in
their criminality by the two women convicted today - who used last 
year’s disorder as an opportunity to put the public and the emergency 
services at risk.

'They deliberately targeted unarmed police officers putting their lives in grave danger in a calculated and cowardly manner.

'The conclusion of this case 
demonstrates that the partners working together within the criminal 
justice system will do everything in their power to bring dangerous 
offenders such as these to justice.

The Crown alleges that the officers had been lured into the area by the pre-planned arson attack

Mr Lockhart QC told the court: 'As many as four guns were present. Scientific evidence confirms that'
