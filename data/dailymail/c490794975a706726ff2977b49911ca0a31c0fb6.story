Kenwyne Jones scored the first goal of the new Football League season as Blackburn Rovers and Cardiff City served up a Friday night appetiser that augurs well for the next nine months.

Jones, who had failed to score in 10 games as Cardiff slipped out of the Premier League last season, showed the Sky Bet Championship should be more to his liking when he was given time and space to put away an 18th minute header.

But to prove to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his demanding owner Vincent Tan that the second tier will not be a cakewalk for their pre-season promotion favourites, Blackburn deservedly hit back through Scotland U21 international Tom Cairney after Peter Whittingham had been robbed by Jordan Rhodes.

Though the quality wasn’t World Cup-standard – Cairney’s swerving strike excepted - there was enough commitment and attacking ambition to make the 15,000 fans inside Ewood Park glad that competitive domestic football is back.

With the pressure on Solskjaer after relegation, he was the happier manager even though his side were left hanging on for periods of the second half.

‘We proved we’ve got the characters to deal with these games,’ he said.

‘We’ve gone away from home and dug out a result, I thought our attitude was spot-on. We could have gone gung-ho but didn’t, and earned a point that may be important in May.

‘We’ve got players like Mark Hudson who enjoy defending, they like heading the ball away.’

Cardiff have already lost Fraizer Campbell, Steven Caulker and Jordon Mutch this summer with Chile World Cup star Gary Medel absent on Friday ahead of an expected £8million move to Inter Milan.

They did receive an early stroke of luck after 70 seconds when referee Andrew Madley gave Rovers a free-kick instead of a penalty after Hudson had handled inside the box.

But the visitors took advantage of their good fortune when Hudson flicked on a Whittingham free-kick after 18 minutes and Jones headed in only his second goal since joining the club from Stoke in January.

Fiery encounter: The opening match of the Championship season had its fair share of meaty challenges

The big Trinidadian, who missed the start of pre-season to deal with a family issue back home, celebrated with his trademark backflip and Solskjaer knows he will need him firing this season.

‘Kenwyne has worked really hard. He came in a few weeks late because he’s had personal challenges but really come on,’ said the Norwegian manager.

To Blackburn’s credit, they bounced back well after falling behind. Their reward arrived after 40 minutes when Rhodes, not renowned for his tigerish tackling, caught Whittingham napping and Cairney crashed home the loose ball with a left-foot finish that swerved away from David Marshall.

The second half was largely Rovers and their manager Gary Bowyer claimed: ‘I thought we deserved a bit more from the game.

‘We had a lot of the ball against a team that has just come down from the Premier League and scored an outstanding goal. The lad (Cairney) is a great technician and has a fantastic left foot.’

Rudy Gestede, one of two former Cardiff players in the Rovers line-up along with the impressive Craig Conway, had Blackburn’s best chances but miscued with an overhead kick and then sent a header over with Marshall stranded.

On the downside, a back injury to Matt Kilgallon leaves Bowyer short of bodies at the back. ‘I’ll need to have a word with the people upstairs,’ he said.

Solskjaer has already done the majority of his transfer business but will need an extra defender when Medel leaves. Only one of his six summer recruits, forward Adam Le Fondre, started on Friday night.

The man dubbed the baby-face assassin at Manchester United knows his team will have to be tough this season. He was secretly pleased by one robust tackle made in the second half by the normally-silky Whittingham. 

"Proper" football is back.
