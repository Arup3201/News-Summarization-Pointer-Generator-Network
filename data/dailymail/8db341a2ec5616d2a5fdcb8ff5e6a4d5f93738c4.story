Donna told the sentencing hearing that she and her deceased husband had met when she was 16.

'He was my best friend... We talked often and we talked easily,' she said in court.

'Being from a police family you know there is always risk. I never dreamt this risk would become a reality.

'As hard as the last two years have been for me... Bryson is the one that has been made a victim.'

'You should save the tears that you shed in the dock,' he told the Barbieris.

'You will not be forgiven.'

Mitchell, now 21, has pleaded guilty to murder while his mother Fiona, 46, has pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment. 

Det Insp Anderson's mother, Shirley, said and her husband had been visiting a relative in hospital when a television story about a police officer being killed was broadcast.

'I was feeling empathy for the family to be receiving the awful, devastating news,' she said.

'My heart aches for my child, I have lost a beautiful and caring son,' Shirley said in her victim impact statement. 

Having served as a police officer himself for almost 40 years, Rex said he thought he was immune to shocking details.

'But nothing prepared me for when I made that call... The events were the most shattering experience in my entire life,' he said. 

'Even though two years have passed I still at times look at a police officer to see if it's Bryson.'
