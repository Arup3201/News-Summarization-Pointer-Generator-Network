A Triple M Radio producer has been inundated with messages from prospective partners after a workplace ploy.

After Tuesday's Grill Team show, hosts Matty Johns, Mark Geyer and Gus Worland uploaded a picture of 26-year-old Nick Slater to Facebook with a mobile number where people could reach him.

In less than 24 hours, he had received over 130 messages from a varied range of male and female listeners, reports News.com.

The ploy came about after a waitress handed the audio engineer her number while out at some work drinks.

Unconvinced it was a one off, his colleagues decided to put it to the test and see if anyone else was romantically interested in him.

'The Producers had a few drinks on Friday & Handsome Nick got a number off the waitress in the first 10 minutes!'

'We don't believe him that this never happens to him. Here's Nicks number...let's see how many calls he gets!'

Slater received a torrent of voicemails, ranging from date proposals to 'heavy panting'

In the following 24 hours Slater received a torrent of voicemails, ranging from date proposals to 'heavy panting.'

'There was a wide range of messages from some nice girls and a few nice blokes as well. There was even a grandma in there too.,' he said.

'We went through and listened to most of them. It was mostly people looking for lust, telling me to give them a call … it was all good fun.'

Slater said his long-term girlfriend Kimberley understood of the station's antics, and she found the gag 'hilarious.'
