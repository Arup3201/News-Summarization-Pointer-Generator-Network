Criticism: Health minister Dan Poulter has spoken out against the 'no cuddling' policies which are in place at many nurseries

A minister last night called on nurseries to scrap controversial kiss and cuddle bans imposed to protect them from abuse allegations - saying they were putting children's development at risk.

Dr Dan Poulter, the children's health minister, demanded nurseries review 'heavy-handed and draconian' policies which mean thousands of toddlers are spending whole days in childcare without any comfort from staff.

He said it was 'extraordinary and alarming' that staff are threatened with the sack for attempting to comfort children distraught because they are missing their parents or because they have grazed their knee.

The minister, who also works as a hospital doctor in women's and children's health, said such policies were 'damaging to a child's health, wellbeing, and future life chances'.

The Daily Mail revealed earlier this week that an increasing number of nurseries were imposing bans on staff kissing children in the wake of the conviction of paedophile nursery worker Vanessa George.

An investigation has found that others instruct staff not to cuddle toddlers, or let them sit on their laps, for all but the shortest periods - claiming that the simple acts of affection harm the independence of the child.

But child development experts say the lack of contact threatens the well-being of children. They warn that denying young children affection can have a devastating impact on their development, their happiness and their stress levels.

Dr Poulter called on nurseries who had introduced such policies to urgently review their rules.

'It is a natural human instinct to comfort a distressed child, to hold out a hand if they fall, to reassure them if they are crying; physical contact is an important part of that,' he said.

'The blanket "no contact" approach being taken by some nurseries is extraordinary and alarming; there is increasingly strong evidence to suggest that a lack of emotional support and physical reassurance from parents and carers during the early years can be damaging to a child's health, wellbeing, and future life chances,' Dr Poulter said.

He said the fear of abuse accusations had led some nurseries to draw up policies which were now so 'draconian and heavy-handed' that children were being denied basic care.

'Of course it is right for nurseries to properly vet the backgrounds of all staff looking after children, but comforting a child that has hurt itself is part and parcel of good childcare,' he said.

The findings of the investigation by daynurseries.co.uk, an online directory of nursery schools, reopened the debate about whether nurseries are the best place to bring up children.

Penny Tassoni, president of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, said: 'It is actually the duty of anyone working with young children to offer physical contact.

'Young children who are not with their parents are likely to produce a stress hormone known as cortisol. Having access to a hug or even holding a hand of a key person can help to reduce anxiety.

'Policies that are draconian in terms of not allowing children to be reassured are not fit for purpose as they ignore children's right to being nurtured.'

The policy of Twinkle Star Day Nursery in Portsmouth says: 'Children are encouraged to be independent; therefore prolonged periods of cuddling and sitting on practitioners' laps is discouraged. Kissing children is forbidden and may result in a disciplinary.'

In Barnstaple, North Devon, Ladybirds Day Nursery's policy says: 'While some contact is unavoidable (nappy changing and toilet training), there are other activities, often instigated by the children themselves, that we explain is not appropriate.

'This includes any form of kissing on cheek, forehead or lips when a parent is not present.'

One nursery manager said: 'I tell my staff not to kiss children and explain the reasons for it, to protect them from any allegations. Children naturally come to you for a kiss and a cuddle, and we always turn to the side so that they can kiss our cheeks.

'I don't even kiss my own daughter while in nursery.'

During discussions about the issue, one parent said: 'The thought of a small baby in a nursery going all day without a kiss from someone makes me quite sad.'

Sarah Steel, managing director of the Old Station Nursery chain, said cuddles were important for young children.

'All the evidence around attachment theory and the guidance in the Early Years' Foundation Stage supports close physical contact with the youngest children and the importance of contact for all children,' she said.

'A good, confident practitioner would know exactly what was appropriate, and less experienced staff need to have good role models.'
