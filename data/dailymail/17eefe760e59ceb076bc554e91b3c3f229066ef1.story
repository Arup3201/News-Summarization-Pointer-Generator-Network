Its gentle comedy is said to be a firm favourite of The Queen, so perhaps that is the reason why Last of the Summer Wine has been repeated on television a mind-numbing 483 times so far this year.

After an incredible 37-year run, the last of of the Yorkshire-set classic's 295 episodes screened three years ago.

But far from fading into obscurity, the BBC-produced comedy, the longest-running sitcom in history, tops the list of programmes repeated in 2013, with a remarkable five episodes being shown every day on channels like Gold and Yesterday.

Enduring favourite: Last of the Summer Wine, starring Robert Fyfe, Burt Kwouk, Brian Murphy and Russ Abbot,  has been repeated nearly 500 times already this year

Comedy legends: David Jason's Only Fools and Horses made the list of repeats, while The Good Life, starring the late Richard Briers, was also among the programmes showed most in the first three months of 2013

Another seemingly timeless series to make the list is 'Allo 'Allo, set in a small town occupied during the Second World War, which had 108 repeats of its 85 episodes, which were made between 1982 and 1992.

One of the greatest sitcoms of all time, Only Fools and Horses, starring David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst as the Trotter brothers, is on the list with 161 episodes.

Of the top most-repeated shows, BBC-produced programmes dominated, with eight featuring in the table, produced after a survey by the British Comedy Guide.

The only ITV series on the list are The Upper Hand, the 1990s sitcom starring Honor Blackman and Joe McGann, with 110 reruns, and children's programme My Parents Are Aliens which had 157 repeats.

Old favourite: Gordon Kaye, Carmen Silvera, Vicki Michelle, Artur Bostrom Nicholas Frankau and John D Collins, starred in 'Allo 'Allo

Popular: My Family, starring Robert Lindsay and Zoe Wanamaker, aired for 11 series and is still being repeated heavily today

Odd ones out: The only ITV shows to feature in the repeat list were The Upper Hand and My Parents are Aliens

The second most-aired show this year is the ever-popular comedy, My Family, starring Robert Lindsay and Zoe Wanamaker, which ran for 11 series between 2000 and 2011.

Shows still producing new episodes that feature are QI (179 repeats) and Have I Got News For You (126).

Mark Boosey, editor of the British Comedy Guide website, said in the Daily Telegraph that Last of the Summer Wine retains a sizeable elderly fanbase, which is said to include the Queen and Afghan president Hamid Karzai.

Ongoing: The only current shows to make the list were Have I Got News For You and QI, starring Stephen Fry

He said: 'Last of the Summer Wine still seems to have a fan base. It is gentle, very inclusive comedy which everyone can watch and which can be shown before the watershed.

'It appeals to an older generation and perhaps suggests there is not enough new comedy catering for them.'

Last of the Summer Wine - 483 episodes

My Family - 233 repeats since the beginning of 2013

QI - One of only two current shows on list, 179 times

Only Fools and Horses - Classic repeated 161 times

The Good Life - Starring Richard Briers, 132 repeats

My Parents Are Aliens - ITV show repeated 157 times

Have I Got News for You - Ongoing show, 126 repeats

The Upper Hand - Another ITV series, 110 repeats

'Allo 'Allo - French-themed classic, repeated 108 times

He added: 'The list in general does seem to have a nostalgic feel to it.'

Filmed in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, in its 1980s heyday, the Sunday night institution attracted audiences of 19 million. Its revolved around the misadventures of a group of elderly friends.

Over the years, the cast changed as actors retired or died. After the death of Bill Owen, who played Compo, in 1999, his son, Tom, joined as Compo's son, Tom.

Other notable characters included the battleaxe Nora Batty, played by Kathy Staff until her death in 2008.

Another classic in the top 10 was The Good Life, which had just 30 original episodes for the BBC, but has already been repeated 132 times this year.

Richard Briers, the star, died earlier this year and some episodes were shown in tribute, but even before his death, repeats were regularly shown on Gold.

The original run, from 1973 to 2010, made it the world's longest-running sitcom.
