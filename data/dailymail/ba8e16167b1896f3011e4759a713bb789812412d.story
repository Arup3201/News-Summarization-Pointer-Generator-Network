German statesman Helmut Kohl has launched an 11th-hour bid to stop the publication of a new book in which he pours scorn on his protege Angela Merkel.

The controversial book by journalist Heribert Schwan is based on extensive interviews with the former chancellor, who during his 16-year tenure oversaw the reunification of his country.

In it, Mr Kohl reportedly claims Mrs Merkel could 'barely hold a knife and fork properly' while saying that at state dinners, 'she loitered around so much I had to repeatedly tell her to pull herself together.'

The 84-year-old also branded former labour minister Norbert Blüm - who was instrumental in exposing the slush funds which nearly ended up with him being sent to jail in 1999 - a 'traitor', and Christian Wulff, who went on to become president of Germany under Merkel before being forced to resign over alleged improprieties, a 'loser' and a 'zero.'

Mr Kohl, who has retreated from public life in recent years since suffering a bad fall, has instructed lawyers to call an emergency session at the nation's Supreme Court to halt the book entitled: 'Legacy: the Kohl transcripts.'

He fell out with Mr Schwan, his former biographer, after the pair conducted more than 600 hours of taped interviews in 2001 and 2002, the year his wife Hannelore killed herself after suffering from a devastating allergy to light.

In August a court told Mr Schwan he must return the tapes to Mr Kohl, but the journalist was able to delay handing them over until he was able to make full transcripts of the conversations.

It is not known whether the publication of the book, set to be unveiled at the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday, is even legal. But excerpts have already been published by news magazine Der Spiegel.

'The girl': Mr Kohl reportedly claims Mrs Merkel could 'barely hold a knife and fork properly' while saying that at state dinners, 'she loitered around so much I had to repeatedly tell her to pull herself together'

As well as trashing Mrs Merkel - the politician he formerly referred to as 'the girl' - Mr Kohl also argues against overestimating the role of East Germany's civil rights movement, which faced off against the communist regime in 1989 in a series of protests which became known as the 'Velvet Revolution.'

'It would be wrong to pretend that the Holy Ghost has suddenly descended over Leipzig and changed the world,' Mr Kohl said in reference to the protests.

Instead, he said the fall of the wall was the result of the Soviet Union's sclerotic economy. 'Gorbachev went through the books and had to concede that his game was up, and that he could not prop up the regime,' he said.

'Gorbachev's legacy is that he called time on Communism, partially against his will, but de facto he finished it off. Without violence. Without bloodshed.

'Beyond that I am struggling to think of much else in terms of real legacy.'

Mr Schwan claims that he was sacked as Mr Kohl's biographer and ordered to return the tapes after falling out with his new wife, Maike Kohl-Richter.

Critics say Mr Kohl, was angry that his political life was over after the 1999 slush-fund scandal, and hit out at Merkel and others in frustration at his perception that he was no longer needed on the world stage.
