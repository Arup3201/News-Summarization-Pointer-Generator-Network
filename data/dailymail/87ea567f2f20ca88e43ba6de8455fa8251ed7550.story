Good Morning America weatherman Sam Champion celebrated his recent marriage to Ruben Robierb with a New Year's Eve reception in Miami - the same place and date where the couple met three years ago.

The TV personality had wed the Brazilian photographer in New York on Dec. 21 before a coterie of friends at Mr Champion's Manhattan apartment but at the South Florida shindig on December 31 they were surrounded by 100 of their closest friends and family members.

The holiday wedding came shortly after the ABC anchor came out in October and announced his engagement to Mr Robierb, a fine-arts photographer based in Miami.

After their 10-minute marriage ceremony in New York, conducted by New York State Supreme Court Justice George J. Silver, the lovebirds decided to again celebrate their vows before a group of 100 friends and family including the mothers of both grooms and Mr Champion's sister, Teresa.

The weatherman's father, James, had 
passed away in 2010 but one guest shared that the mother of the 
51-year-old groom, Sylvia, had remarked that her late husband 'would 
have been so proud' to see his son on this special day.

MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts conducted the ceremony for the ABC newsman and Mr Robierb, 35, according to the Miami Herald.

Mr Roberts is himself a recent newlywed, having tied the knot with his longtime boyfriend Patrick Abner on September 29.

The news of Champion's coming out was first revealed in the pages of the New York Times, in an article on the wedding Mr Roberts.

Mr Champion and Mr Robierb were present at the event and were seen taking to the dancefloor together.

'We're getting married New Year's Eve in Miami,' Mr Champion told the Times.

But his Brazilian fiancé corrected: 'We'll do it here officially, and then have a party in Miami.'

Same-sex marriage has been legal in 
New York since last year, but is not legal in Florida. The pair are 
expected to split their time between the two states.

After the ceremony conducted by the cable anchor, producer-director Richard Jay-Alexander serenaded the crowd at the poolside reception with a rendition of the Frank Loesser favorite 'What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?' that was personalized for the couple. 

'Who could be crazy to suppose, These men would be the two who chose. Out of the millions of people out there, And found love,' he sang.

'Ooh, but it’s true for Rubem and for Sam, Like it was part of some big master plan. Look where we are this New Year’s, New Year’s Eve.'

Jazz singer Nicole Henry also performed for guests.

The couple asked that in lieu of wedding gifts, well wishers make a donation to The Point Foundation, a non-profit organization which grants scholarships to LGBTQ students.

Engaged: Mr Champion announced his engagement to Mr Robierb on October 5

The New Year's Eve fest follows the smaller scale shindig in the Big Apple earlier in December.

Mr Champion's Good Morning America colleague Robin Roberts, who is recovering from a bone marrow transplant, even felt well enough to attend and recited a poem by Elizabeth Barrett Brownin.

Mr Champion revealed on October 5 that he is gay and that he and his partner of three years would soon marry.

The weather anchor's sexual orientation 
had long been known to his friends and media colleagues, but he had 
never publicly discussed it before making the announcement.

In
a statement on the ABC News website posted in October, Mr Champion 
said: 'We are thrilled and so excited and thank everyone for their good 
wishes.'

He later tweeted: 'I've never been happier to share a bit of personal news!!'

Celebrity: The star is one of the best-known weather anchors on American television

The cast and crew of Good Morning 
America cheered on their colleague on the show before his big day on 
Dec. 21 and offered him and his husband their best wishes.

When asked if he were nervous, Mr Champion said, 'The whole family's at the house right now ... so I should be nervous.'

Good Morning America anchor George Stephanopoulos told Champion to 'remember every second' of his special day.

Mr
Champion's decision to reveal his sexuality through a casual reference 
after years of being openly gay in private follows a recent trend of 
celebrities slipping out of the proverbial closet without making a fuss.

The
most famous example was that of CNN host Anderson Cooper, who revealed 
the worst-kept secret in TV with a brief email to blogger Andrew 
Sullivan in July.

Jim 
Parsons, star of The Big Bang Theory, came out in an interview with the 
New York Times in May in which he talked about his boyfriend.

Mr Champion has been a TV weatherman for over two decades, and has been on Good Morning America since 2006.
