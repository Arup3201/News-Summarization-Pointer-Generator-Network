The survey shows that women's weight fluctuates from 4-10lbs each year

Forget about warming comfort food and step away from the office biscuit tin.

For those looking to wow colleagues - and the office crush - at this year’s Christmas party, the diet needs to start today.

With 62 per cent of women admitting in a new survey that they plan to slim down for the festive season, today has been earmarked as the time to start in order to safely drop a dress size.

Over half (52 per cent) the women polled admitted to wanting to lose at least 9lbs before they slip into their party dresses (the equivalent of a full dress size).

Just 10 per cent admitted they were completely happy with their current shape and size.

And it seems it is the workplace where we most want to impress.

Some 40 per cent of women revealed they 
specifically want to drop the pounds ahead of their work Christmas party
to feel confident in front of their colleagues.

But yearly summer and pre-Christmas slim downs can be dangerous, not only to our health if weight is dropped too fast, but also to our wallets.

Growing in and out of clothes is one of the UK’s biggest fashion complaints costing the average women up to £500 a year, with 59 per cent of women admitting their weight fluctuates anywhere between 4-10lbs every year. 

Fad diets, New Year resolutions and special occasions - namely Christmas, weddings and holidays - were given as the main reasons for these weight fluctuations.  

One in five women now claims to own up 15 party dresses, with the Little Black Dress polled as the favourite festive frock choice for 73 per cent of women, who admitted to owning at least ten LBDs at any one time. 

Almost a third of women also admitted to holding onto up to five dresses that are too small for them, in the hope of one day getting into them once again.

If you want to drop a dress size before the party season starts, it's time to swap the donuts for fruit

The survey was conducted by George at Asda as they release a new range of 30 Little Black Dresses.

The NHS recommends that if you’re trying to lose weight, the safe weekly rate of weight loss is between 0.5kg and 1kg. That’s between around 1lb to 2lb a week.

Lose weight faster than this, and you are at risk of a host of health problems that include malnutrition and gallstones.

Fad diets (that involve simply changing your diet for a few weeks) associated with very rapid weight loss are also unlikely to lead you to a healthy weight in the long-term.

They recommend women should eat and drink about 1,400kcal a day when trying to loose weight.
