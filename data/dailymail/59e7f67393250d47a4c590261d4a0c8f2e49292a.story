Arsenal's players looked in good spirits after a successful Christmas period, as they trained ahead of the third of their festive fixtures hoping to pick up another three points.

Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez appeared to be having a great time, with the Chilean star in particular unable to suppress his laughter throughout Wednesday's training session.

Defender Laurent Koscielny, who returned from injury for the 2-1 win over West Ham on Sunday, was also in a good mood, showing off for the cameras as Arsenal prepared for a trip to Southampton.

The Gunners go into the game off the back of consecutive wins which have lifted them to fifth in the table, level on points with Thursday's opponents, and a win could take them as high as third if Manchester United lose at Stoke.

But Arsenal may have to play the game without a recognised striker, with Olivier Giroud serving the second game of his three-match suspension and Danny Welbeck doubtful and due to be assessed before the game.

However, elsewhere Arsene Wenger's injury problems are beginning to ease, with Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky fit again, while Koscielny could be set for a second consecutive start after a stop-start first half of the season.

Walcott could feature against Southampton having been on the bench following his recovery from a groin problem, and while midfielder Aaron Ramsey is not match fit as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury, Czech playmaker Rosicky should return having been rested.

'Ramsey is not available yet, there is no setback, but it is a bit slower than I expected it to be,' said Wenger on Tuesday.

'Because he had a setback last year, we have to be very cautious with his thigh - he was out for three months, so we have to be a bit more cautious than we would like to be.'

Arsenal go into Thursday's game knowing that a win will take them above Southampton, and could even see them move as high as third

Arsene Wenger could be without a recognised striker for the vital fixture, with Olivier Giroud suspended and Danny Welbeck a doubt

Wenger accepts it is a difficult balance to keep all of his players fresh over the hectic Christmas schedule and also not lose the dynamic of the team.

'Rotation is a sensitive subject because you can destabilise your team with too much rotation, so you have to find the right numbers of rotating the team,' said Wenger.

'Overall, you want to keep the balance of your team and as well refresh sometimes in the positions where players are a bit tired.'
