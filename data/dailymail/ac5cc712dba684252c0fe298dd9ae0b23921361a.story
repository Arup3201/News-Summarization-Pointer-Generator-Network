Felipe Massa was surprised Nico Rosberg was not penalised by the stewards at the Belgian Grand Prix for 'destroying' the race of Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton.

Rosberg has been given support since his collision with Hamilton at Spa at the end of last month by Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso, both of whom claimed what unfolded was 'a racing incident'.

Of all the people to fight Hamilton's corner, Massa would likely be last on many people's list given the duo had a magnetic attraction to one another during a turbulent 2011 campaign when they often clashed on track, and occasionally off it, when the Briton was at McLaren and Brazilian with Ferrari.

Surprise: Felipe Massa believes Nico Rosberg was fortunate to escape the Belgian GP without punishment

But Massa feels the stewards were wrong for not looking into the lap-two collision in Belgium which saw Rosberg puncture a tyre on Hamilton's car after clipping it with his front wing.

Hamilton was forced to retire late on due to damage sustained to the car courtesy of his long drive back to the pits, whilst Rosberg went on to finish second to open up a 29-point gap.

Assessing the incident, Williams driver Massa said: 'What I saw in the last race was not so correct from Nico, to be honest.

'I don't understand why they (the stewards) didn't give him a penalty because it was impossible to pass Lewis at that place (Les Combes). He needed to brake.

'He didn't brake, they touched, Nico was behind, so Nico destroyed Lewis' race.

'I don't understand why the FIA, the stewards, didn't give him a penalty.'

Earlier this season race stewards were informed to be more lenient in looking at incidents rather than reviewing every single indiscretion.

Massa has suggested they have now gone too far the other way, adding: 'If you are the team and you have both drivers fighting for the championship, it's fantastic for the team.

'They are not fighting another team, they are going to be champions anyway, so they need to allow them to fight.

'But for me, Nico should have had a penalty for what he did as he destroyed the race of another guy fighting for the championship.

'I think maybe the stewards are losing a little bit of direction. They need to carry on doing what is inside the rules.'

Given Rosberg's advantage in the championship, and despite double points available at the final race in Abu Dhabi in November, Massa is in no doubt as to who has the advantage.

'Nico - he has more points so it's easier for him. I'd put my money on him now,' Massa added.
