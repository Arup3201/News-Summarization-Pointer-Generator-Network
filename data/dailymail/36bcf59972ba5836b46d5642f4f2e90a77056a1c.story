New allegations: Police are investigating after a man who was in care at Roecliffe Manor children's home in Woodhouse Eaves, Leicestershire said that Savile 'dragged away' a girl later found dead

Police are today investigating whether Jimmy Savile may have been involved in the death of a child during his 50 year campaign of abuse, it was revealed today.

The male witness, who claims he was also sexually abused by the late DJ, said he saw Savile and a friend 'drag away' a little girl who was found dead in Leicestershire the next day.

The vulnerable child called either 'April or Elizabeth' was being cared for at the Roecliffe Manor children's  convalescent home in Woodhouse Eaves in the 1960s, the informant said.

The allegation was detailed in a report 
published today following an independent investigation into Savile by 
University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.

The report stated: 'The Informant stated that he witnessed a girl, who he 
believes was called April or Elizabeth, being dragged across the garden 
at Roecliffe Manor by “Jimmy” and another man. She appeared to be in a 
stupor.

'The next day the Informant was told by the Matron that this girl had died'.

However, the report concluded that it could not corroborate the claim and said it had found 'no reference to the death of a child at Roecliffe Manor'.

But Leicestershire Police has today confirmed it is investigating the claims. Roecliffe
 Manor was shut shortly after the alleged incident in the 1960s.

A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said: 'Leicestershire
 Police has received the report on Roecliffe Manor, and started an 
investigation to determine if abuse took place and if so to what extent.
 That investigation is ongoing.'

The report did conclude that sexual abuse was 'likely to have taken place' at the home but said its extent could not be known.

It added that it 'has not been possible to associate Jimmy Savile with the abuse' other than the claim made by the complainant, who was recovering from tuberculosis between the ages of four and nine.

The report's author Sue Walters said her investigation had been 'challenging' because the allegations into the home in the village of Woodhouse Eaves dated back over 50 years.

She concluded the evidence of two victims who alleged sexual abuse had taken place was 'convincing', and has passed their complaints to police for further investigation.

'Other than the informant, no other individual interviewed, or record read, made reference to Jimmy Savile (JS) being present at Roecliffe Manor,' the report read.

Ms Walters 
concluded the evidence she had seen was 'not of sufficient strength in 
nature to enable the lead investigator to conclude that the man who 
abused the Informant was in fact JS.'

The 
victim's allegations first came to light when he contacted Operation 
Yewtree investigators, who have looked into hundreds of claims of abuse 
at Savile's hands, claiming he was abused by the former DJ on at least 
four occasions.

He told Ms 
Walters a man 'called Jimmy' would come to the home, bringing books and 
film reels, and 'would have us kissing and cuddling him'.

The victim told her 'he managed to make you feel loved and cared for' but had later abused him.

evidence that Jimmy Savile had visited, although they believe children 
were abused there

On a few 
occasions, the man said he and another little girl were taken from 
Roecliffe in the back of a camper van by Savile and a male friend, who 
had an Irish or Scottish accent.

He said that when taken out of the home, they would go to a motorway service station or for picnics.
The alleged abuse took place between 1959 and 1964.

Welcoming 
the findings, Carole Ribbins, the NHS trust's nursing director, said the
 trust already had 'very robust processes in place to protect children 
and vulnerable adults'.

'However, 
we are not complacent and we are in the process of implementing the 
independent external investigator's recommendations from the report,' 
added Ms Ribbins.

She praised Ms Walters' thoroughness and said all relevant information had now been passed to Leicestershire Police.

The force 
said its investigations into the alleged abuse were ongoing, and urged 
anyone with information to call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 
555111.
