Long gone are the days of the office Christmas party being a lacklustre affair with soggy sausage rolls and being stuck in a corner with Boring Brian from accounts.

Now, the festive shindig with colleagues has blossomed into a high point of the festive season.

Indeed, companies often try to outdo each other and their previous years' events, with elaborate themes, gourmet food and swanky locations. 

The office Christmas party has blossomed into a high point of the festive party season for many

However, an open bar and socialising with senior colleagues can (and often does) spell disaster for many, with potentially very real consequences for your career.

As the office party season gets into full swing, FEMAIL is here to help you sidestep the hidden faux pas and avoid any embarrassing situations.

The photobooth 

It's  important to visit the photobooth before and after hitting the bar, that way you at least have a respectable set to show people

Now a must-have at every party and wedding, photobooths can be a focal point for a good event.

Avoid the inevitable queue by heading to the booth early on in the evening. This also hopefully will avoid you entering after one too many beverages and ending up with a permanent reminder of that time you licked your boss's face.

Elliot Gold, manager at  Mega Booth, which supplies photo booths all around the country, says they have seen demand over double in the past year alone, with increasing numbers of businesses and corporations embracing the booths.

While  they offer a huge source of fun at parties as well as a hilarious mementos of the evening, Elliot warns that hitting a photobooth drunk with colleagues can be problematic. 

'I can't tell you how many times I've seen crazy stuff. People are always asking if they can flash in the booths!'

Offering advice for the best photos he says: 'Don't peak too soon! With our booths you get four pictures each time and you'll often see people being really enthusiastic with the props in the first shot and by the last they're just standing there looking confused.

'It's also important to do a "before" and "after" hitting the bar, that way you at least have a respectable set to show people. 

'Before you do anything stupid or too wild make sure the pictures aren't being projected live up on a big screen at the party. And don't get naked!'

His top tip? Moustaches.

'Any kind of fake moustache, on both sexes, is always a sure fire winner,' he says.

Victoria's pose will disguise any extra chins 

Celebrity photographer Max Cisotti gives FEMAIL advice on how to work the photobooth like a red carpet.

'The most important thing is your posture. Make sure you sit up straight. 

'Your pose will depend on your face shape so try and learn your angles. 

'Celebrities like Victoria Beckham have perfected their poses. 

'She always leans forward ever so slightly and arches her back. 

'This stretches out your jaw and hides any potential second chins! 

'Of course in photobooths what is fun is taking pictures with more than one person.

'The important thing is that faces are on the same focal plane. 

'This is because the booth will be set to focus perfectly on the person on the stool.

'So try not to have people too far forward in the booth or and  too far back. 

'Also pay attention to where the machine tells you to look. Make sure everyone is on eye level when the shutter goes.'

The open bar  

A major key is not to drink too much alcohol.

With 23 per cent admitting to dancing inappropriately at the office bash in the past and 20 per cent accidentally kissing a colleague under the influence, there is good reason to be wary! 

Cocktail and party expert BarChick tells FEMAIL: 'The open bar is all about playing the long game. 

'There's no need to go in too hard, it's about quality not quantity. The joke is on anyone kicking off their night with shots; don't be that guy.

'Assess what the bar has to offer and work out what you're drinking. Too much mixing will lead to trouble, so get tactical and plan the night ahead.

'Kicking off with champagne never hurt anyone, but stick with it all night and you’re in for trouble.

When it comes to shots, opt for 100 per cent agave tequila to save your head the next morning 

'Think long drinks. A decent G&T is a good staple – especially if you’re going for singles.

'Time for shots? Don’t be afraid to be the know-it-all asking for a good quality 100 per cent agave tequila - your head will thank you in the morning. Or sip on some Jägermeister, it is herbal after all, so probably a better choice than the full of sugar sours being pushed your way.

'Less sugar the better. Margaritas your thing? Make it a Tommy’s and you’ll cut out the sugar and lessen the booze content.

'Just remember to keep it simple; if the barman looks like he doesn't know what he's doing, don't give him the opportunity to make you a bad drink, simplicity is key.

'Treat your night like an athlete might and stay hydrated. Sure we might sound like your mother but drink water, they do know best after all. Every drink you have should be matched with a glass of water. This will not keep you sober but it will help you last later, so you can party all night and still look fabulous, that is the end game after all right?'

Conversations   

From having an argument with an office rival to inappropriately asking for a raise by the bar, cringeworthy conversations at the office bash lead to 20 per cent of revellers having apologised to a boss or colleague for what they said research from music streaming service blinkbox Music.

From flirting to having an argument, conversations at the office party lead to 20% of us having to apologise

One in ten people have asked for a raise at the office party and regretted it while 14 per cent have been left red faced the next day by flirting with the boss.

Similarly, seven per cent have ended up in a fight with their office rivals.

Along with not getting too drunk, which loosens the tongue and lowers inhibition, a good rule of thumb is to steer clear of discussing work related matters.

Sticking to neutral topics such as co-workers family and holiday plans is a safe bet. 

Preparing a set of topics that are interesting but not contentious before the party may seem extreme, but can be a lifesaver when it comes to a boss or senior member of the company.

Romance

Seeing co-workers in their glad rags and looking all dolled up can play strange tricks on the mind.

Add alcohol, mistletoe and low lighting into the equation and many can find themselves perturbed by their sudden romantic feelings towards colleagues.

In fact, 20 per cent have snogged a colleague at a work Christmas party, leading to 14 per cent admitting calling in sick the next day simply to avoid having to face them.

If you know you are partial to an ill-advised drunken kiss, it is best to appointed a trusted office friend as 'chaperone' for the evening.

Tell them to keep an eye out for anything looking too steamy and give them permission to swiftly (but subtly) intervene.

The problem becomes more complex if you in fact are already seeing a colleague. Many end up in inter-office relationships, and large numbers choOse to keep it secret, both to avoid awkwardness and to protect their professionalism at work.

It can be difficult deciding at what point you should 'announce' your relationship to co-workers, however the office party is almost certainly not the place.

Drunken people can easily misconstrue things and explaining how your coupling will in no way influence your work performance over loud cheesy music is probably not the best idea.

If you are both attending and worried your passion may get the better of you and blow your cover, try and set ground rules.

Designate areas of the party to each of you and try your best to stick to them. Or you could even decide that one of you will remain sober all night to ensure a professional distance is maintained.
