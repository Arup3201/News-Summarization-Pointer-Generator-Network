She's been determinately denying rumours linking her to billionaire James Packer.

But Miranda Kerr will have an uphill battle ahead if she continues to push the same line after the casino boss' assistant was seen leaving her Woollahra home on Wednesday.

Clutching a copy of the supermodel's self help book, Treasure Yourself, the man kept his gaze downcast as he left the rental property and stepped into the passenger seat of an awaiting Holden sedan.

Caught out: James Packer's personal assistant was seen leaving supermodel Miranda Kerr's rented Woollahra property clutching a copy of her self-help book Treasure Yourself on Thursday

He remained inside the property for several hours in a meeting with Miranda, 31, and her publicist Annie Kelly, before leaving alone.

One of Packer's regular drivers was waiting outside of the home.

The model appeared on breakfast television earlier in the morning to once again assert she is not currently in any romantic relationship.

'I'm single and focused on my son and my career,' she told Channel Nine reporter Sylvia Jeffreys when she sat down for an interview with the Today show.

She gave a similar line to Network Ten's Angela Bishop who interviewed the mother-of-one, who split from her former husband Orlando Bloom in October last year, at a Swarovski hosted event on Wednesday night.

She said: 'I'm a single lady and I'm really happy.'

Miranda has been repeatedly linked to James Packer and is rumoured to have sparked his now infamous Bondi beach punch-up with his long-time friend and Nine Network CEO David Gyngell.

Miranda was seen stepping out later on Thursday to visit the headquarters of her organic skin care range Kora.

Fronting photographers with a wide smile, she kept a pair of dark sunglasses firmly in place as she entered the building.

The former Victoria's Secret angel teamed a skinny-leg pair of leather pants with a leopard print shirt featuring a demure, button-up neckline.

Adding height to her 5ft 11in frame, swept her brunette tresses into a tidy top-knot and applied lashings of ruby red lipstick.
