Huma Abedin will be taking a long vacation from her role as Hillary Clinton’s right-hand woman next month to ‘support her family’ during husband Anthony Weiner’s mayoral campaign.

Though the official line is that Abedin has long had this vacation in the works, it comes just as Weiner’s campaign has taken a huge dive amid revelations of the former congressman’s continued sexting.

The break from helping Clinton transition into private life may not help Abedin find privacy of her own, though, as Weiner’s Sydney Leathers seems content to continue publicly shaming the serial sexter and just after Abedin was spotted dining with a top Clinton aide.

Time off: Anthony Weiner's wife Huma Abedin will be taking a long vacation from her role as Hillary Clinton's right-hand-woman as her husdand's campaign continues to unravel

‘Huma is not taking a leave of absence,’ a Weiner campaign source told Politico. ‘But she will be taking vacation time in August to support her family during Anthony’s campaign. She had always intended to do this.’

The vacation comes as Hillary Clinton’s dance card for the summer dwindles down to nothing and she and Bill head to East Hampton for the month of August.

Politico’s sources insist that, with the mayoral primary reaching the home stretch, Abedin wanted to be with Weiner and their 18-month-old son Jordan.

Why now? The official line from the Weiner campaign is that Abedin has long had the vacation scheduled, though it comes at a conspicuous time for the campaign

Abedin was a major focus of coverage of her husband beginning the moment she approached the podium to speak on July 23 after a website released screenshots of highly sexual interactions between Weiner and political blogger Sydney Leathers.

Abedin maintained at the time that she would stand by Weiner in spite of his renewed scandal.

She hasn’t spoken publicly on the matter since. She also failed to appear in a recent campaign ad released by Weiner.

Family time: Abedin intends to take the time to help her family during her husband's campaign, but what form that help will take is not known

Some say Clinton insider Philippe Reines had a hand in her decision not to support her husband by appearing in the ad. Whose image Reines was concerned about, Abedin’s or Hillary Clinton’s, is unclear.

Also unclear is how Abedin will, exactly, be supporting her family during her long holiday.

As Sydney Leathers makes the media rounds, with catty appearances on Howard Stern and rumors she’ll be appearing in a pornographic film, Weiner certainly has his hands full.

Perhaps her role will be as counselor to her husbands it becomes more and more clear that her support can’t save his flagging campaign.

She hinted the help may not be political by choosing not to appear in a recent ad for the Weiner campaign. Here, she dines with Clinton insider Philippe Reines, who may have counseled her to stay out of the ad
