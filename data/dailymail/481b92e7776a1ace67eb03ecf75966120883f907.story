Harry Redknapp has expressed an interest in returning to football as part of a consortium.

The 67-year-old, who resigned as manager of Queens Park Rangers last week to have knee surgery, has been linked with a group of investors looking to buy a club near to his Dorset home.

He confirmed the speculation on BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme but didn't reveal any further details.

Harry Redknapp is considering investing in a club close to his Dorset home after stepping down as QPR boss

Redknapp, who requires knee surgery, did not rule out a return to management if the right job came up

'It's something that could interest me, I'd just like to be involved,' Redknapp said.

'I spoke to people about one or two bits and pieces that may come up but at the moment it's not gone that far.'

The former Bournemouth, West Ham, Portsmouth, Southampton and Tottenham manager also refused to rule out a return to the managerial hotseat if the right job came along.

He said: 'I'll get my knee sorted, I'll go back and see the specialist for whatever he feels needs doing.

'I haven't really done my rehab, that's been my biggest problem, I'm always too busy to spend an hour getting my quads right.

Les Ferdinand was appointed QPR's director of football following Redknapp's departure from Loftus Road

Chris Ramsey oversaw coaching duties from the home dug-out for Saturday's match with Southampton

Tim Sherwood, the former Spurs coach, is the favourite to take over at Loftus Road

'I'd miss the buzz of football. It would have to be something I really wanted to do if I was going to have another go.

'If anything came up that was interesting I'd have to look at it.'

Tim Sherwood, another former Spurs manager, is the favourite to replace Redknapp and would work alongside caretakers Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey.

'I would think there's every chance Tim would go there,' added Redknapp.

The Hoops remain in the relegation zone, a point shy of safety, following their late defeat at home to Southampton on Saturday.
