Perfection: Girls' schools are campaigning to stop their pupils becoming obsessed with being perfect, a trait that can lead to eating disorders. Stock image

Top girls’ schools are on a quest to stop female pupils becoming obsessed with being perfect.

Oxford High School for Girls has launched an initiative dubbed ‘The Death of Little Miss Perfect’, which aims to teach girls it is ‘fine not to get everything right’.

The scheme includes online tests which become progressively harder within a time limit so pupils are unable to answer them.

Headmistress Judith Carlisle said: ‘Real life is not about perfection. Even the most successful of lives has its share of setbacks, disappointments and failures.’

Meanwhile girls’ boarding school Heathfield, in Ascot, only allows pupils to carry mobile phones without internet access until they are 13 to keep them away from social media.  

Details emerged in the latest edition of high society magazine Tatler, out tomorrow.

Dr Adrienne Key, lead clinician for eating disorders at the Priory, told the magazine that perfectionists were more likely to suffer from eating disorders – and social networking sites were driving an increase in the incidence of illnesses such as anorexia.

‘Perfectionism wrecks self-esteem unless it’s checked. It can be a brilliant trait to get you places, but unfortunately it involves a lot of self-criticism and unless you can moderate that, you become more susceptible to doing drastic things,’ she said.

Dr Key said she had seen a ‘massive uptake’ in the number of patients citing social media as playing a role in their illness.

‘It’s exploded in the past five years. What social media is doing is making us more dissatisfied with our bodies, as well as pushing a message that they are modifiable,’ she said.

Social media was encouraging eating disorders in people who might not previously have developed problems, she warned.

‘It’s like sitting someone who’s a bit run-down next to someone with a cold. They’re going to catch that cold. If you were more robust, with better immunity, you could withstand it. But social media is so powerful that it’s catching those who only have slight tendencies.’

At Oxford High, headmistress Judith Carlisle introduced ‘The Death of Little Miss Perfect’ last year to encourage pupils to ‘get real’, while still aiming high.

‘Real life is not about perfection,’ she said.

‘Even the most successful of lives has its share of setbacks, disappointments and failures. It’s as much my job to prepare students for this uncompromising and often unfair real world as it is to ensure that they have the A-level grades to get them to university. That’s why Little Miss Perfect, I’m afraid, just has to go.’ 

At Heathfield, headmistress Jo Heywood told Tatler of the subtle pressure to be perfect promoted by, among others, parents.

‘I’ve had parents in my study who’ve said “I want my daughter to go to Cambridge to study architecture”,’ she said.

‘And I’ve turned to them and said “lovely, but what does your daughter want?”

Managing expectations:  ‘Real life is not about perfection. Even the most successful of lives has its share of setbacks, disappointments and failures,’ said Oxford High School headmistress Judith Carlisle

She also told of the difficulties in blocking websites which promote anorexia, known as ‘pro-ana’ sites.

‘Social media is a great thing, but also very dangerous. Pro-ana websites are so hard to block because new ones are constantly appearing,’ she said.

Her pupils at Heathfield are only allowed ‘brick’ mobile phones without internet access until they are 13.

The school has also introduced talks for parents on Instagram and Snapchat.

‘We teach the parents how to use Twitter, because it’s a different world. Some of them were quite shocked,’ added Mrs Heywood.

Latest figures show that hospital admissions for eating disorders rose eight per cent in the 12 months to October 2013, to 2,560.

Two schoolgirls, Sophia Parvizi-Wayne and Amber Van Dam, are now campaigning for mental health awareness to be put on the national curriculum.

Ms Parvizi-Wayne suffered from anorexia and Ms van Dam helped her through it.

‘We want it on the manifesto of every political party. There has to be more education. It’s about constantly raising awareness,’ said Ms van Dam.
