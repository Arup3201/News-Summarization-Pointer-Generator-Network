A woman who struggled with body image throughout her childhood has proven once and for all that size does not matter when it comes to busting a move.

Radio producer Whitney Way Thore's series of videos called A Fat Girl Dancing went viral in recent months thanks to her impressive skills on the dance floor.

What began as a YouTube video, has exploded into a worldwide movement that aims to fight body shame and promote the idea of self-love and acceptance as a step toward total wellness.

And now, Whitney, who hails from North Carolina, has been snapped up to star in a new  video packed with all her signature moves.

When offered the opportunity to play the lead role in Muffin Top, a new  video by fitness instructor Fitty Smallz, Whitney jumped at the opportunity.

Spreading the word: She believes her partnership with Fitty Smallz will take her entire No Body Shame platform to the next level

She said: 'Once I understood the platform, heard the song and learned that he was a serious professional with over 30 years of experience, I know it was a perfect match. My partnership with Fitty Smallz and our Muffin Top project will take my entire No Body Shame platform to the next level.'

The No Body Shame campaign recognises body shame as a complex, multi-faceted issue that is best dealt with by first unapologetically loving yourself as you are, without being shamed out of a gym or off a dance floor, explains Whitney.

Fitty Smallz said: 'Most people don’t realise that my platform is all about fitness. The typical fitness professional goes at people with “eat right and exercise,” but people aren’t listening to that. They are also bombarded with messages of weight loss and images of perfect bodies that make them feel bad about their own bodies.

'We try to give them something they can relate to and laugh about. Then it makes them think and hopefully inspires them. No one likes to be lectured.' 

Whitney has struggled with her body image since childhood. 

The lifelong dancer was teaching others the skill as early as 16, but weight gain took a serious toll on her confidence.

'Unable to face my reflection, I failed out of dance class my first semester,' she told the Huffington Post.

'By the time I had graduated college, been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, moved to Korea, and gained 200 pounds, I was finally able to dance socially, at a club or party, but never dreamed I would take a class or perform publicly ever again.'

But thanks to some soul searching and the redemptive powers of dance and viral internet fame, Thore is back and better than ever.  

'I am learning to practice aggressive self-love. I have lived my life as a 130-pound woman and as a 350-pound woman in North America, in Europe, and in Asia. Cultural norms, societal pressures, and the whims of the fashion industry do not define my worth as woman or a human being,' proclaims Thore

At age 29, after years of living with eating disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, weight fluctuations, self-doubt and depression, she made a life-changing decision to love and accept herself as she is, to rise above the negativity that society forces upon anyone who is different, to live her life to the fullest, regardless of what the scale says, and, most importantly, to dance.

'I am learning to practice aggressive self-love,' she writes on her website. 'I have lived my life as a 130-pound woman and as a 350-pound woman in North America, in Europe, and in Asia. Cultural norms, societal pressures, and the whims of the fashion industry do not define my worth as woman or a human being.' 

With the support of tens of thousands of men and women all over the world, the No Body Shame Campaign has grown into a full-fledged movement and she's accrued thousands of fans.

She added: 'It's a movement that knows positive change can’t start or be sustained until you are truly kind to yourself from the inside out. A movement that reaches even further - and aims to show that your body doesn’t have to limit you, whether it be deemed “too skinny,” “too fat,” or “too broken.” 

'A movement that asserts that you don’t need society’s permission to seek your right to happiness.'
