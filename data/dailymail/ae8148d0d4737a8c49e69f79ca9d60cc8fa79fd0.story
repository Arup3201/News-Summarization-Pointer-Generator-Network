The annual alcohol-fuelled Suicide Sunday celebrations marking the end of Cambridge University's exam season got off to their customary raucous start with a cardboard boat race.

In a parody of the more sober Oxford and Cambridge boat race on the Thames, students took to their makeshift vessels to row down the River Cam.

Famed for being a day of carousing and drunken antics, the undergraduates stripped down to shorts and bikinis for a splash about on the River Cam.

Using arm bands and rubber rings for support a team of three gingerly made their entrance for the beginning of the boat race

More than 30 homemade punts made from cardboard, glue and gaffer tape took to the River Cam, with competitors cheered on by hundreds of spectators

Armed with a bottle for Dutch courage, a team made their way to the water with their bird-shaped contraption

Taking a genteel approach, these Cambridge University students relaxed with some wine and port before heading to the starting line

The students spent the morning fashioning homemade punts and canoes from cardboard, glue and gaffer tape.

After some Dutch courage, they then raced along the historic Backs for half a mile from Jesus Green to Magdalene Bridge as spectators cheered the wobbly vessels on from the tow path.

Some were forced to bail out straight away as their soggy creations dissolved around them, but a few better-built rafts survived until the end of the course.

More than 30 teams competed, some 
vessels managing to only carry three people but a sturdy raft 
managed to accommodate 10 people as it whistled past a wooden punt full of tourists.

One student, who did not want to be 
named, rejected the claims that they were behaving disrespectfully to other people who live in the town.

Students making some last minute design decisions to help their chances in the race

The proud creators of a boat, inexplicably holding a Kenny G poster, show off their secret rowing weapon - a racket covered in sellotape

Chaos ensued at the crowded starting line when the students began paddling frantically with an assortment of trays and plastic box lids

Many flimsy vessels disintegrated in seconds, leaving students scurrying for the banks

Comforted by a few cans of beer, two sodden teammates paddled to the side of the River Cam to make their inglorious exit

The 28-year-old, who studied History, said: 'I think its all just a bit of fun really.

'If we were throwing up on the streets it would different but everyone is in good spirits.'

The boat race was among a number of parties taking place in Cambridge today to mark the beginning of May Week, in which students attend daily balls and garden parties to end the academic year on a high.

Elsewhere in town, a garden party in Christ's College saw some students eating their own ties as part of an unusual initiation ceremony.

Other students watched on as they drank gin, vodka and Pimm's in the gardens of the famous college.

Most were on their best behaviour after being told by one of their directors of studies, Dr Robert Hunt, that boisterous behaviour would see them disciplined by the university.

A spokesman for the University of Cambridge also advised students to be careful after trouble in previous years.

The spokesman said: 'Students are frequently advised by their colleges to look after themselves, their friends and their valuables when out socialising.

Looking chilly but confident the big team with an elaborate raft psyched themselves up for the race ahead

The raft went cruising past some bemused tourists relaxing on a traditional punt

The raft was suddenly overtaken by a more compact design, as both teams were watched by tourists who happened to be punting during the chaotic race

Students lined the banks to cheer on their brave friends in the cold water

They celebrated their surprising arrival at the end of the race by hugging each other and jumping in the river

This intrepid team waded out to dry off and carry on their revelries on solid ground

The day of drinking came a month after 
2,000 Cambridge students took part in Caesarian Sunday - a similar event
celebrating the end of term.

Hundreds of students also attended 
the annual party at Anstey Hall in a seventeenth century manor house in 
the sleepy Cambridgeshire village of Trumpington.

The exclusive party was organised three miles from the university by the Wyverns' drinking society.

The garden party, which has a bikini dress code for girls and blazers and shorts for boys, involved downing excessive amounts of alcohol and riotous drinking games.

The annual jelly wrestling contest, which usually sees two girls in bikinis wrestling in a pool of jelly, was cancelled this year following a petition saying it was 'sexist'.

Jubilant scenes awaited the winners who miraculously managed to row through the entire 500 metres

This team's effort looked surprisingly sturdy, still largely in tact after its difficult journey down the River Cam

The clear up operation begins as binmen collected up the soggy cardboard this afternoon

Four years ago the party had to be held 
in a new location for the first time in 80 years after officials banned 
students from holding the event on university land.

The controversial decision was made after a 23-year-old student was arrested during the infamous jelly wrestling contest in which bikini-clad students battle it out for a £250 prize, when she punched a spectator.

The drinking society is based at 
Magdalene College, whose former alumni include Downton Abbey writer 
Julian Fellowes, diarist Samuel Pepys, Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, 
and journalist John Simpson.
