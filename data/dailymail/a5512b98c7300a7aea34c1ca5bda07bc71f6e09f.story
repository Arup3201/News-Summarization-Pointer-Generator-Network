A couple were banned from owning animals for eight years today - after they admitted keeping 56 dogs in the back garden of their semi-detatched home.

Shocked animal welfare officers found 69 animals - including 56 dogs, six birds, three cats and four chinchillas - at the family home of James Hood, 40, and wife Nicola, 32.

The couple - who also have five children including a 16-month-old baby - escaped jail after they were given conditional discharges for admitting keeping the malnourished pets in filthy conditions.

Sick: James and Nicola Hood were banned from keeping animals for eight years

Magistrates banned the pair from keeping animals for eight years after hearing their home had been pelted with eggs and BRICKS since the allegations emerged.

They were given seven days to get rid of the animals they still own - including a cat, seven gerbils, two hamsters, a lizard, a budgie, four cockatoos and a parrot.

Magistrates in Taunton, Somerset, heard the pair admitted keeping the disease-ridden dogs in filthy conditions and pleaded guilty to nine animal welfare charges last month.

The court heard RSPCA officers were greeted with a ‘sea of dogs barking wildly’ when they visited their home in Minehead, Somerset, in October last year.

Officials conducted a full search of their four-bedroomed house and small grounds to discover a total of 56 dogs crammed into their back garden.

They counted 36 huskies, four collies, two German shepherds, two labradors, one boxer dog, two Staffordshire bull terriers with two puppies, one springer spaniel, two doberman, three rotweillers and one greyhound.

The court was told they had turned their home into a makeshift ‘animal sanctuary’.

Officers also found three cats kept in an upstairs bathroom and four parakeets in the bedroom of the crying nine-month old baby.

James Mumford, prosecuting yesterday, read out a statement from the vet who attended the address: ‘The situation was totally inappropriate and unsuitable for the animals.

‘Of all the 56 dogs seized the majority were well below the expected body condition score.

‘Most scored one to one and a half - with the ideal score being three - showing they were inadequately nourished.’

He told the court that many were found to be suffering from medical problems including gastro-intestinal disease and skin problems.

Ian Denley, defending the couple, said: ‘I think this is a very sad case.

‘You have two people who have taken in animals for the best motives, in some instances they were to be euthanised.

‘They have clearly done what they thought at the time was the right thing.

‘Clearly the number of animals has been the problem and as a consequence they have not been able to cope.

‘Since proceedings have begun they have been villainised. They have had hate mail and bricks and eggs thrown at their house.

‘They are very upset and very distraught and want to put the matter behind them.

‘It was a very sad case and they want to move on for themselves and their family.’

Keith Parks, chair of the bench at Taunton Magistrates Court, gave the pair conditional discharges for 24 months and banned them from keeping animals for eight years.

The couple were also ordered to pay costs of £250 each at £5 a week.

Mr Parks said: ‘In recognising the seriousness of the offences and the number of animals involved you are disqualified from owning or keeping any animal for the next eight years.’

Speaking outside the court, RSPCA Inspector Amanda Swift said: ‘This is a very good sentence today - we are pleased.

‘We had a disqualification for all animals for eight years which stops them having any more animals for the foreseeable future.’
