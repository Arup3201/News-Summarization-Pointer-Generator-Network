Paddy Kenny is close to joining Championship outfit Bolton Wanderers. 

The 36-year-old free agent is to sign a short term contract at the Macron Stadium. 

Kenny, who left Leeds United in the summer, will provide cover for Andy Lonergan at Bolton with Adam Bogdan facing two months on the sidelines because of a finger problem.

Bolton manager Dougie Freedman said: 'Paddy Kenny is a very experienced player. We have had a difficult time last week with Adam Bogdan’s freakish injury so Paddy is going to come in on a short-term contract.' 

Bolton are also close to agreeing compensation with Crewe for Max Clayton. The 20-year-old free agent has been training with the club. 

Clayton trained with Sunderland during pre-season but was unable to agree terms with the Black Cats.
