Classic British bicycle manufacturer Raleigh was today sold to Dutch rival Accell for £62.2million.

The 125-year-old firm, which was founded in Nottingham and is perhaps most famous for its Raleigh Chopper, will complement Accell’s stable of brands including Batavus and Sparta.

The deal, which still needs the approval of regulators, is likely to net Raleigh chief executive Alan Finden-Crofts a multimillion-pound windfall, as he is one the company’s largest shareholders after he led a management buyout in 2001.

Sold: British bicycle company Raleigh as today bought by Dutch rival Accell for £62.2million. Above, the classic Chopper, which was launched in 1970 and relaunched in 2004

Raleigh began life when Sir Frank Bowden bought an interest in a small bike company in the city’s Raleigh Street in 1887.

Raleigh,
which sold 850,000 bikes worldwide last year and whose brands include 
Avenir and Diamondback, still designs bikes in Nottingham, where it 
employs more than 100 staff, but they are made in the Far East.

It
has grown to become a company with sales of £195million a year and 430 
employees. Its bikes have also been ridden by Tour de France winners.

Raleigh,
which ceased production in Nottingham in 2002, was once the biggest 
bicycle maker in the world, employing 8,000 people after the Second 
World War.

Other famous Raleigh brands include Grifter, Burner, Diamondback and Avenir.

Raleigh
operates through production and distribution companies in Britain, U.S.
and Canada and has worldwide licensing activities.

In
the UK, Raleigh’s bikes are sold through 1,500 independent bike dealers
as well as through Amazon, Toys R Us, Argos and its network of about 70
Cyclelife stores.

The deal
is expected to complete at the end of next month and Raleigh’s 
management team will stay on, with Mr Finden-Crofts remaining as boss 
for at least six months.

Mr
Finden-Crofts said: 'In Raleigh, Accell Group is acquiring a true 
global brand with 125 years of heritage and distribution into over 140 
countries worldwide, and I am entirely confident that Raleigh has found 
the ideal employer to support the employees, customers, suppliers and 
the future growth of the business.'

As well as the Chopper, other famous Raleigh children's brands include Grifter, Burner (above) and Diamondback BMX

The
company’s milestones include launching the Chopper in 1970 and the 
acquisition of TI Group in 1960, which made it the world’s largest 
producer of two-wheeled transport.

In 1980, Joop Zoetemelk of Holland, riding for TI Raleigh Creda, won the Tour de France.

Accell
chief executive Rene Takens said the deal would add 'a strong 
traditional and global brand with a rich heritage' to its portfolio, 
with the Diamondback range strengthening its mountain bike and BMX 
offer.

Jonathan Buxton, 
partner at Cavendish Corporate Finance, which advised on the deal, said:
'Raleigh is one of the very few examples of a UK company which has 
successfully migrated from a pure manufacturing model into a global 
brand - boosting international sales, particularly in North America, and
with a fast-growing presence in Asia.'
