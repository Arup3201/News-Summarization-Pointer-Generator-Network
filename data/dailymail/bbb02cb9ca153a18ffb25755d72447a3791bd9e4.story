His boisterous tendency is well known from that infamous moment in 1992.

Neil Kinnock’s triumphalist  chant of ‘we’re all right’ at a Labour Party rally left him a laughing stock when he lost the General Election days later.

Fast forward 21 years and it seems he hasn’t learnt his lesson.

Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock's celebrations prompted him to be moved so he could sit with other Cardiff supporters, after his cheers annoyed home fans at Craven Cottage (previous photos)

The former Labour leader was spotted at a Premier League football match celebrating wildly when his beloved Cardiff City scored first, 12 minutes into the game.

Unfortunately he was seated in the home stands of the rival team Fulham, where his premature boasting was given short shrift.

He was promptly escorted from his seat by stewards, along with two of his grandchildren who were with him, and moved to another part of the ground.

Lord Kinnock’s exuberance provoked ‘angry responses’ from Fulham fans for ‘spoiling’ their enjoyment of the game, according to an official for the home team.

After the match, a Cardiff City supporter wrote on the club’s fan forum: ‘Pleased to see Mr Kinnock sitting two rows in front of me.

‘I am not sure if Neil has as much experience as me of sitting with the home fans but his celebration of our first goal led to him being escorted from the stand.’

Cardiff, who Lord Kinnock has supported since boyhood, won the game 2-1

Cardiff fans had been allocated seats in the home stands after their official allocation sold out.

London resident Lord Kinnock was later spotted going ‘bonkers’ in another part of the Craven Cottage ground when Cardiff scored in injury time, handing them a 2-1 victory.

It was newly-promoted Cardiff’s first away win in the top flight since 1962, when Lord Kinnock was a student in Wales.

‘I don’t think I went wild but I did express great joy, standing up, there’s no doubt at all about that.'

Yesterday Sarah Brookes, from Fulham FC, said: ‘Mr Kinnock was located in the home stand on Saturday and caused some angry responses when he and his family celebrated the Cardiff City goal.

‘He was relocated in the Putney end – the away stand – where there were a number of spare seats.

‘Mr Kinnock was asked very politely by one of the stewards if he would like to sit with the away fans. We would do that with any fan who celebrates a goal because the home area is for home fans.’

A spokesman for the Labour peer claimed it was just a coincidence that he was moved.

But Lord Kinnock later confessed: ‘I didn’t give it a second thought, sitting in the front row by the corner flag and everybody was very pleasant.

‘Then in the 12th minute I did what I’ve done for 65 years of supporting the city and leapt up, and so did the kids.’

Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, he continued: ‘I don’t think I went wild but I did express great joy, standing up, there’s no doubt at all about that.

‘Within a minute or so the Fulham stewards, who were a model of courtesy, said, “Mr Kinnock we think you might be more comfortable in the Cardiff stand”.

‘So I said, “OK, where would that be?” And they pointed to some seats and I said that would be fine.

‘The stewards acted quite quickly and the last thing I wanted to do was cause them any trouble or offend anyone’s sensibilities. I thought I was just in a mixed section.’

Lord Kinnock said he and his family walked the 25 yards into the Cardiff section where they were ‘greeted with some warmth’ and ‘had a much better view of the game’.

‘Everyone was very good natured and good humoured,’ he added.
