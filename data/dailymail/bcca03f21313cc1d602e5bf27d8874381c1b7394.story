An Australian woman who has been visiting the Bali Nine for 10 years inside Kerobokan prison have described Myuran Sukuraman and Andrew Chan as 'really wonderful human beings'.

The woman, who did not wish be named, is part of a Protestant church group funded by Australians who help those serving time inside the Bali jail.

As the days are numbered for Sukuraman and Chan, who will be transported later this week to Nusa Kambagan where they will be executed, the woman described the atmosphere inside the prison as 'really sad'.

'Everyone is sad right now,' she said.

The visitor said she had many private conversations with the Bali Nine pair and it would be a 'shame' to see them shot dead.

'They're really wonderful human beings. They are the kindest, they are the gentlest, the smartest guys around actually, and that's what so sad because they have helped hundreds and hundreds of prisoners in there [Kerobokan prison],' the woman said.

'Many, many times I have seen and witnessed the many, many things they have done. It would be a very big shame to humanity if their lives were taken.'

Earlier on Monday, the parents of Sukuraman were allowed to bypass the regular visitor process at Kerobokan jail as the family gathered to say their final goodbyes ahead of his impending execution.

The convicted drug smuggler's family arrived at the prison in a black van about 9.30am on Monday and were driven straight up to the visitors' door.

They walked in and out, ignoring the media scrum that await for the family outside who follow them intensely along a three-metre-long path leading to the driveway.

It comes after Andrew Chan's parents Ken and Helen Chan left Bali on Sunday night after saying goodbye for what could possibly be the last time.

Sukuraman's mother and father were followed by a second black van believed to be carrying his family and friends.

It's understood the families of the Bali duo have officially left. 

One woman, who was with Michael Chan told Daily Mail Australia: 'I cannot say anything. Sorry.' 

The convicted drug smuggler's family bypassed the regular process where visitors of inmates need to sign in.

Identification normally must be provided to officials, a form must be filled out with details including the visitor's name, address, the prisoner's name and their relationship to the prisoner.

It seems relatively easy to visit inmates inside the prison. A complete stranger could walk into a visitors registration complex, adjoining the prison, and request to see an inmate.

A number is given to the visitor and they sit in a waiting room to wait for their number to be called.

Regular visitors have warned others of the possible long wait and opt to stand outside the entrance to wait their number to be called.

They tell people what to expect behind the metal door. When visitors are let through they have to hand in all electronic equipment, including cameras and mobile phones.

Officials perform a pat down for security reasons before they let you into a roomful of inmates and their family.

Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve

Bali Nine member Matthew Norman said it was 'impossible' to speak about the impending deaths of Chan and Sukumaran

The visiting hall is not enclosed but is undercover. Friends and family of inmates are forced to sit on the floor on woven mates while speaking to their loved ones, amongst other prisoners and their guests.

A seasoned visitor cautioned that sometimes people would have sex inside the hall in front of everyone. She said the first time she visited, it gave her a shock to see the sight.

Amongst the prisoners on Monday was Matthew Norman, the youngest of the Bali Nine. He was sitting and talking with an older woman, while leaning up against the wall.

When approached to speak about the impending deaths of Sukumaran and Chan, the soft spoken prisoner said it was 'impossible' for him to be interviewed.

Inside the jail, Norman is shielded from the media pack outside who have been stationed at the prison for about a month.
