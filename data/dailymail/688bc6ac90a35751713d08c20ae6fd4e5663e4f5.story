Australia can still win next year's World Cup despite their off-field turmoil, All Blacks fly-half Colin Slade has warned.

Slade coolly slotted an overtime conversion to edge New Zealand to a 29-28 Bledisloe Cup victory on October 18, only to drop out of Steve Hansen's squad on Dan Carter's return to fitness.

The Crusaders playmaker admitted he felt sympathy for the Wallabies, whose coach Ewen McKenzie confirmed his resignation in the wake of that Brisbane defeat.

The Kurtley Beale text message saga led to Di Patston quitting the Wallabies claiming stress problems, with McKenzie forced to refute allegations of an affair with the team business manager.

Slade can heap yet more misery on Australia when he leads the Barbarians line at Twickenham on Saturday, but he is adamant new coach Michael Cheika will quickly whip the Wallabies into World Cup shape.

'They are definitely still contenders next year,' said 27-year-old Slade.

'They showed in that last Test they're not far away at all.

'We've never taken them lightly, whatever the media have said, we've always respected them.

'They've got a hell of a team, a lot of quality individuals.

'They are having a tough time at the moment, but I tell you what, situations like that can really galvanise the team in the long-term.

'They've got a new coach in so they will build from there.

'And they'll be a massive force by the time the World Cup comes, absolutely no doubt.

'It's obviously disappointing for them, the things that are happening at the moment, but I don't want to take any responsibility for adding to that with that conversion.'

Slade remains on standby for New Zealand's northern hemisphere tour, despite missing out on initial selection owing to Carter's recovery from a litany of leg problems.

Carter's Crusaders club-mate remains as unfazed as he is well versed in bowing to the world superstar's superior standing.

When New Zealand lifted the 2011 World Cup on home soil, Stephen Donald had to be dragged away from a fishing trip to solve a fly-half injury crisis.

Slade said such a last-minute reprieve proves it is never worth giving up on earning a recall.

'What's a blessing can also be a curse I suppose,' said Slade of his long-standing rivalry and friendship with Carter.

'I feel honoured to have played alongside and with Dan for so long. But at the same time selection comes down to numbers.

'And with him locked up in that in any team because he's such a world-class player it does leave one less spot for me.

'That's just the nature of rugby: unfortunately they can't take everyone and I got squeezed out of the tour.

'Myself and a couple of others will stay around after the weekend just in case of any injuries, we'll watch the England game and then go home.

'What happened in 2011 with Stephen (Donald), those situations can arise and you've got to be ready at any time.

'So you've got to prepare, work hard and stay ready just in case.

'You can't just cruise or fade away: you've got to work as hard as you can to get into that team.

'Even if you miss out, hopefully you're not too far away.

'If that situation happens again, you've got to be ready to step up.'
