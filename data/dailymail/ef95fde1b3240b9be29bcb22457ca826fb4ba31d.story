Mysterious British graffiti artist Banksy is staging a month-long ‘residency’ in New York City, but the first two works have both already been vandalized within hours of being created.

The reclusive artist announced on his website on Tuesday that he would be ‘attempting to host an entire show on the streets of New York’ throughout October in a project called Better Out Than In.

The first piece was found on the streets of the Lower East Side neighborhood in Manhattan.

The first of Banksy's new pieces showed two boys wearing caps, with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said 'Graffiti Is A Crime'

It showed two boys wearing caps, with one reaching up to a can of spray paint and a sign which said ‘Graffiti Is A Crime.’

The work, called ‘The street is in play’, was accompanied by a telephone number which passersby could call for an audio guide to the painting.

The audio informed viewers somewhat prophetically: ‘Before you, you will see a spray art by the artist Banksy. Or maybe not. It's probably been painted over by now.’

It also said that the ‘children represent youth’ and the ‘sign represents, well, signs.’

But within hours of its whereabouts being announced, the work had been first whitewashed and then covered with other clearly inferior graffiti

But no sooner had word got out about the art work than it had been defaced, first with whitewash and then with other inferior graffiti which read: 'Sweaty palms made me lose the love of my life!'

A second piece of art was then uncovered in the Chelsea neighborhood underneath the High Line tourist attraction.

The white, spray-painted text read: ‘This is my New York accent’ in a traditional graffiti font, while underneath it was sprayed in a sans serif font: ‘…normally I write like this.’

But that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top of it.   

Banksy, a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of Bristol, England and whose real identity is unknown, has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world, known for his trademark spray-paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary.

The artist appeared in and directed the 2010 Oscar-nominated documentary 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' with his face and voice obscured.

Earlier this year, two spray-painted murals by Banksy were pulled from an auction in Miami, including one entitled 'Slave Labour,' after questions arose about the ownership of the works and how the auction house obtained them.

'Slave Labour' eventually sold at a private auction in London for $1.1 million in June.

Another Banksy mural, the 'Flower Girl' found painted on the wall of a Los Angeles gas station in 2008, is up for auction in December in Beverly Hills, and estimated to fetch between $150,000 and $300,000.

Unfortunately that too has already been vandalized with someone spraying their own tag over the top
