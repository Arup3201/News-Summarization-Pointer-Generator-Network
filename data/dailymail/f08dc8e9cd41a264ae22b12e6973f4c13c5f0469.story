One thing Britain isn't short of is coastline, so when it comes to choosing our best beach, competition is tough.

But holidaymakers have crowned Woolacombe Beach in Devon, with its long stretches of golden sand, the best in the UK.

And the Devon hotspot has beaten off competition from Turkey, Spain and Greece to be named fourth best beach in Europe.

With its dramatic coastline and pristine stretch of golden sand it's no wonder Woolacombe Beach in Devon has been named the best beach in the UK, and the fourth best beach in Europe

Oh we do like to be beside the seaside! Weymouth Beach in Dorset also beat stiff competition and was named the eighth best beach in Europe, and the second best beach in the UK after Woolacombe

Travellers on TripAdvisor voted Dorset's Weymouth Beach the second best in the UK and eighth in Europe.

The two beaches meant that the UK has many hotspots listed in Europe's top 10 as Spain, Italy and Greece - three popular holiday destinations famed for their coastlines.  

Three other UK beaches were also featured in the list of the top 20 European beaches.

Rhossili beach in Swansea was 11th place, St Brelade’s Bay beach in Jersey was 14th and Porthminster beach at St Ives in Cornwall came in at 18th on the list, which was dominated by the South of England.

The only beach north of the border to make an appearance on the list of best UK beaches was hauntingly beautiful Luskentyre Beach on the Isle of Harris, which managed a respectable eighth place.

Woolacombe Beach has knocked Rhossili off top spot this year in the UK rankings, with the Welsh destination now in third spot.

The magnificent beach at Rhossili Bay in the Gower Peninsula in Wales is a well-know beauty spot and was third on the best UK beach list

Further south, the stunning beach at St Brelade's Bay in Jersey was named the fourth best beach in Britain

Three of the best UK beaches are in Cornwall, including the one at St. Ives Porthminster, pictured here with the harbour in the distance

The haunting beauty of Luskentyre Beach on the Isle of Harris in Scotland earned it eighth spot on the best UK beach list

The five UK beaches in the European top 20 also took the first five places in the top UK beach list, while Woolacombe was 13th in the world’s top beach table.

Nestled between Morte Point and Baggy Point in North Devon, Woolacombe Beach stretches for three miles with golden sand and rolling, unbroken surf and is a popular spot for surfers.

 *According to TripAdvisor travellers' reviews

TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said: 'The presence of two UK beaches in Europe’s top 10 is further proof of what a fantastic tourist draw the UK’s coastline really is.'

Europe’s top beach was Rabbit beach at Lampedusa in Italy, with Playa de Ses Illetes in Formentera in the Spanish Balearic Islands in second place and Elafonissi beach in Greece third. 

Rabbit Beach in Lampedusa, Italy has been named the best beach in Europe, and was also name the third best beach in the world

The emerald-green water at Playa de ses Illetes in Formentera helped bag second spot on the best European beach list

The unspoiled beauty of Elafonissi Beach on the Greek island of Crete earned made it the third best beach in Europe

And the best beach in the world? Baia do Sancho beach in the Fernando de Noronha island chain in Brazil is the best beach in the world according to travellers' reviews by TripAdvisor

But for the best beach in the world you'll need to travel a little further afield. The top accolade was taken by Baia do Sancho beach in the Fernando de Noronha island chain of Brazil, closely followed by Grace Bay in the Turks and Caicos island of Providenciales in the Caribbean.

Rabbit Beach at Lampedusa in Italy was third.
