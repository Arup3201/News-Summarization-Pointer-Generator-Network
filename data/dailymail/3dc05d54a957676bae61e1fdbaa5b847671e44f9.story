The mother of Steven Sotloff, the US journalist identified as the next hostage to be executed by ISIS, has today desperately begged her son's violent captors to release him in a heart-wrenching appeal that was aired on an Arabian  television network.

Shirley Sotloff directed her message to the leader of ISIS and the self-professed caliph of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, controversially acknowledging his authority despite the fact many in the Muslim world do not.

'My son is in your hands,' Ms Sotloff said. 'As a mother I ask Your Justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over. I ask you to use your authority to spare his life.'

Release him: Steven Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, took matters into her own hands today, begging for his captors to spare him

ISIS threatened to kill Mr Sotloff in a video uploaded on YouTube last week showing the beheading of his cellmate, and fellow journalist, James Foley.

They said they would only spare his life if the American government stopped its air strikes on Iraq.

Until that point, the Sotloff family have taken great pains not to publicize their son's case under strict instruction from the terror cell.

But after the grisly footage, which showed the 31-year-old paraded by Foley's executioner, was released his mother chose to make a last ditch attempt to appeal to the group for mercy.

I'm sending this message to you Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Qurashi al-Hussein, the caliph of the Islamic state. 

I am Shirley Sotloff. My son is in your hands. Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. 

Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson. He's an honorable man and he's always tried to help the weak.

We have not seen Steven for over a year and we miss him very much. We want to see him home safe and sound and to hug him.

Since Steven's capture I have learned a lot about Islam. I have learned that Islam teaches that no individual should be held responsible for the sins of others. 

Steven has no control over the actions of the US government. He's an innocent journalist. 

I have always learned that you, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you to please release my child. As a mother I ask Your Justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over. 

I ask you to use your authority to spare his life, to follow the example set by the Prophet Mohammed, who protected people of the book. 

I want what every mother wants, to live to see her children's children. I plead with you to grant me this. 

Ms Sotloff said in the statement that in the past year she has learned a lot about Islam, particularly that 'no individual should be held responsible for the sins of others.'

'Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson. He's an honorable man and he's always tried to help the weak,' she said.

'Steven has no control over the actions of the US government. He's an innocent journalist. I have always learned that you, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you to please release my child.'

'I ask you to use your authority to spare his life, to follow the example set by the Prophet Mohammed, who protected people of the book.' 

Concluding, she said: 'I want what every mother wants - to live to see their children's children. I plead with you to grant me this.'

According to the New York Times, in the year since Mr Sotloff went missing in Syria, his mother had asked news organizations to abide by a complete blackout on his disappearance.

This was because ISIS had threatened to kill her son if she publicized his case.

However, it was his captors themselves who identified Mr Sotloff when they declared him the next hostage to be executed.

Chilling footage of the Miami-based freelance journalist shows him paraded in front of the camera and held by the collar of his shirt as a masked operative warned: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.'

The video was the first time his parents, Arthur and Shirley, had heard about Steve since December, according to the hostage's long-time friend Emerson Lotzia.

ISIS terrorists holding the journalist had allowed him to contact his parents, although the details of their communication are unknown.

'They had no idea if he was dead or alive until they saw that footage. It was a mixed bag of emotions for his family, Lotzia said.

'On one hand they knew he was alive. But now they can see what he's going through. It's every parent's worst nightmare.'

Free: The mother's impassioned plea came just minutes after Curtis, pictured Wednesday, who was released from captivity in Syria on Sunday

Lotzia revealed that he had spoken to Sotloff's father after the video's release, and he admitted he felt better before the tape was released than afterwards.

The Times reports that, in referring to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as 'the caliph of the Islamic State,' Ms Sotloff is the first non-Muslim to acknowledge his authority, which may be controversial.

The mother's impassioned plea came just minutes after fellow journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was released from captivity in Syria on Sunday, praised the 'kindness' of the American people as he spoke to the world this morning for the first time since his release.

During a brief news conference outside his mother's Cambridge, Massachusetts home, Curtis said he had 'no idea' how much effort had gone into securing his freedom from the Nusra Front, the a Sunni extremist group group that held him for 22 months.

'In the days following my release, I have learned bit by bit that there have been hundreds of people, brave determined and big-hearted people all over the world working for my release,' he told reporters, clearly thrilled to be back on U.S. soil. 'They've been working for two years on this.'

'I had no idea when I was in prison. I had no idea that so much effort was being expended on my behalf and since I've found out I am overwhelmed by emotion.'
