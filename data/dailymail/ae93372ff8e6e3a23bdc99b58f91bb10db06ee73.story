Louis van Gaal is threatening to take a ‘barstool’ to Holland's World Cup encounter with Australia because of the restricted view he has at the Estadio Beira-Rio.

The Holland manager, who takes over Manchester United after the tournament, complained bitterly of the problem at last night’s pre-match press conference.

‘The dug-out is at a lower level than the pitch and from where I sit there is also a camera directly in front,’ he said.

Fiery: Van Gaal told his press conference of his displeasure at the Estadio Beira-Rio's facilities

‘So I will be like this [motions from side to side] to try to watch the game.

‘In my view the key issue is football and the manager is part of football, and I have no view. As I said, there is a cameraman who deprives me of the view, and we are dug under rather than dug out.

‘That obliges me to stand up but I am a sitting-down coach, not a standing-up coach.’

After the end to the official FIFA press conference a further conversation followed with a small huddle of reporters and from that came a clever idea.

'I’ll need a barstool to watch the match properly,’ Van Gaal declared.
