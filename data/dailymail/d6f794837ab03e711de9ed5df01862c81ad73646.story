BBC staff complained after a religious guru who follows a highly controversial Indian mystic gave them a talk about meditation.

Anand Arun was invited to the Corporation's London headquarters New Broadcasting House last Wednesday to give a talk on 'mindfulness in an era of the 24-hour news cycle'.

Mr Arun is a swami for a religious order called Osho Tapoban, based on the teachings of Osho - a mystic with divisive views on Jews and homosexuality, and two of whose followers carried out an infamous bioterrorist attack in 1984.

Photos from the talk on the swami's Facebook page show him in a room full of staff with their eyes closed and wearing a BBC identity card.

Swami Arun works from an Osho Tapoban meditation camp in the forests of Nepal, whose website states: 'Swami Anand Arun is a true devout and lover of Osho.

'His
 undying love for the master, his simplicity in life and his compassion 
for everyone are his true gifts that have given birth to beautiful Oasis
 of Osho around the world.'

The website adds that he met Osho, who also went by the name Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh,
 in 1969 and ‘took initiation’ from him in 
1974 before being ‘instructed’ to return to Nepal to ‘pioneer the Osho 
movement’.

Jatinder Sidhu, a senior producer on Radio 4’s Today Programme, complained in a letter to the BBC's in-house magazine Ariel, which is published online.

He wrote: 'I’m a bit concerned that something called the BBC Faith Forum 
has invited a man who claims to have been inspired by Osho, aka Swami 
Rajneesh, to give a "discourse" to BBC staff.

'Rajneesh
 was a discredited "godman" hounded out of several countries, who ran 
ashrams best known for attempted murder, sexual licentiousness and 
amassing vast quantities of money (and scores of Rolls Royce cars).

'As I said in my email to the organisers: What next for the faith forum - a devoted follower of Charles Manson?

'As
 an organisation populated by a large number of journalists and 
(hopefully) critical thinking intellectuals, I’m not sure we should be 
promoting people who legitimise cults and criminals.'

Another BBC worker, who asked not to 
be named, said: 'How they let this guy in is incredible - if he believes
 the teachings of Osho then he’s not someone the BBC should be inviting 
to talk to our staff.'

Two followers of Osho, who died in 1990, were convicted of carrying out an infamous bioterrorist attack using salmonella in 1984.

Some 751 people were given food poisoning in the attack in Oregon, where Osho's followers had begun a new commune and wanted control of the area.

Osho was never himself convicted of any offence over the attack.

In a 1985 talk quoted in a book of his speeches, From Death to Deathlessness, Osho claimed the Holocaust was more peaceful than the way in which Indians died under colonial rule.

'Adolf Hitler’s violence with the Jews was far more peaceful, because he killed people in the most up-to-date gas chambers, where you don’t take much time,' he said.

'Thousands of people can be put in a gas chamber, and just a switch is pressed. Within a second you will not know when you were alive and when you died. Within a second, you evaporate.

'The chimneys of the factory start taking you, the smoke – you can call it the holy smoke – and this seems to be a direct way towards God. The smoke simply goes upwards.'

In another lecture in the same collection, he claimed a previous Pope had been gay and said: 'If the pope is homosexual – and popes are infallible – it creates great suspicion, because Jesus was also hanging out with twelve boys. It may be something coming down from Jesus himself.'

The chair of the BBC's Faith Forum, Susan Hayman, said the aim of the Forum was to 'promote greater understanding' among BBC staff and would never lend its support to Osho

And he said: 'AIDS is a religious disease. It started in the monasteries where monks were put together and no woman was allowed. It is the ultimate result of homosexuality, it is a by-product of homosexuality.'

The chair of the BBC’s Faith Forum, Susan Hayman, said the aim of the Forum was to ‘promote greater understanding’ among BBC staff and would never lend its support to Osho.

In a reply to Ariel today, she wrote: 'The BBC Faith Forum is a forum governed by its own constitution and supported by BBC Diversity.

'The main objective of the Forum is to promote a greater understanding and awareness to BBC staff, in general, of the faiths and related faith groups that make up the audience and source of BBC output and in order to do this we have begun to organise various events to be held from time to time.

'For the first of these events, the BBC Faith Forum decided to invite Swami Anand Arun, a meditation guru from Nepal.

'His presentation was well received by the 50 strong audience which was testimony to the interest it generated.'

She added: 'The BBC Faith Forum has no position regarding Osho or any other religious or spiritual gurus and we would like to clarify that the Forum will not be used in any way to promote any cult, sect or groups so as to hurt deep personal sentiments of BBC staff.

'We welcome suggestions and constructive comments from all BBC colleagues.'

The BBC said that events organised by the BBC Forums were entirely independent.

A BBC spokesperson said: 'BBC Faith is one of a number of independently-run staff forums which organise their own events and choose the speakers invited to participate.'
