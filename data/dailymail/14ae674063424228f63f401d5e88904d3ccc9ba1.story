The Pope has today told Ukraine's Prime Minister he will 'do everything possible' for peace in the country, amid the first invasion of Russian forces into the ex-Soviet country's airspace.

It comes as Ukraine's acting defence minister said if Russia sends 'peace-keeping forces' into the country, Kiev's military will fight them.

Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk is cutting short his trip to Rome as tensions in the eastern part of the ex-Soviet country and Western nations threaten sanctions.

Pope Francis and the Ukrainian premier spent 18 minutes behind closed doors, with the head of the Catholic church, who had urged the international community to 'prevent violence' in Ukraine in his Easter Sunday message.

At an exchange of gifts, Yatsenyuk presented Pope Francis with a photograph of Maidan square in Kiev on New Year's night.

'This is where Ukrainians fought for their freedom and rights. Millions of people,' he said.

The pope in return gave the Ukraine leader a pen, saying 'I hope this pen will sign the peace', to which Yatsenyuk replied 'I hope so'.

As the two leaders parted, Francis put his hand on his chest and said 'I will do everything possible' for peace.

Ukrainian acting defence minister Myhailo Koval said the nation's military will fight if Russia sends in troops under the guise of a peace-keeping operation, the Interfax Ukraine news agency reported.

'The United Nations has given no such (peace-keeping) mandate to the Russians,' Mr Koval said.

'Everybody is already fed up with Russia's games with peace-keeping. If they come, they'll get what's coming to them: we will conduct combat operations.'

Russian military aircraft repeatedly crossed into Ukrainian airspace overnight, Prime Minister Yatseniuk said from the Italian capital.

He said: 'Russian military aircraft today at night crossed and violated Ukrainian airspace seven times.

'The only reason is to provoke Ukraine... and to accuse Ukraine of waging war against Russia.'

The Group of Seven rich countries have agreed to slap new sanctions on Moscow as early as Monday amid fears in the West that Russia could be about to invade.

Nerves frayed after pro-Russian rebels holding a group of international OSCE observers in the area earlier Saturday accused them of being 'NATO spies' and vowed to continue detaining them.

The U.S. deployed 150 paratroopers to Lithuania  today, part of efforts by Washington to reassure its eastern European allies, worried by events in Ukraine, that NATO would offer protection in the face of face Russian aggression.

A total of 600 U.S. troops are to be deployed to Poland and the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania for infantry exercises. They are expected to remain in the region on rotation until the end of the year.

'As threats emerged, we see who our real friends are,' Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said as she greeted the troops at the Siauliai air base.

'The Baltic states and Poland are on the border of NATO, so more security measures are urgently needed. This U.S. troop addition is very timely and very necessary,' she said.

Without mentioning Russia, she said the presence of U.S. troops would 'repel those who encroach on stability in Europe and peace in the region', as an invasion of Lithuania would now entangle the Americans.

Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko says Ukraine 'must be a member of NATO' in order to protect itself from Russian aggression. 

Tymoshenko, who is running in the May 25 presidential election, said that while only a minority of Ukrainians supported NATO membership previously, Russia's aggressive actions in the country's east had forced a "fundamental change" in public thinking.

She says 'with his war against us, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin was able to change the mentality of Ukrainians and turn us in a different strategic direction. NATO is the best choice for Ukraine'.

While Tymoshenko hadn't previously backed NATO membership publicly, she and other Ukrainian politicians have ramped up the tough rhetoric as pro-Russia militias seized police stations and government buildings across eastern Ukraine.

'The numbers are not important. If just one of our guests is harmed, this would mean an open confrontation, not with Lithuania but with the United States of America,' Grybauskaite told reporters.

Additional to the U.S. paratroopers, from the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Italy, NATO has said it will triple its usual number of fighter jets patrolling over the Baltics next month to enhance its eastern European defences.

The Baltic states have been members of NATO since 2004, but have not had a persistent presence of foreign troops on their soil before, partly to avoid antagonising Russia.

NATO prepared plans for their defence only in 2010, after Russia invaded Georgia, according to U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks.

'I don't think the deployment of troops is meant to be a message to Russia,' Richard C. Longo, Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe, told reporters in Siauliai.

'It's a message to anyone who will listen, and the message is that the United States of America will honour its commitments to Lithuania.

'Let me make this clear: should Lithuania need NATO, I guarantee NATO will be there,' he said.
