A 93-year-old died after being scalded when care home staff used boiling water  to treat her constipation, an inquest heard.

Freda Owens suffered horrific burns after a carer at The Croft House Rest Home in Freckleton, Lancashire sat her on a commode of boiling water from a kettle thinking it would help her condition.

The painful injuries on her backside had forced her to lie on her side - and this caused a deep tissue pressure sore close to her left hip bone to worsen.

Coroner Alan Wilson heard that this wound was then not spotted by a district nurse, who examined Mrs Owens after the incident on November 2, 2012.

As the great grandmother's condition deteriorated she was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital on November 23.

But the sore continued to go unnoticed until Christmas Eve - nearly two months after the incident.

She died just over a week later at the hospital on January 3, 2013.

Mr Wilson concluded that two factors contributed to Mrs Owens' death - the burns she suffered as a result of the commode and the delay in treatment this caused for her pressure sore.

He said staff had failed to spot the sore because her burns were so severe she found it painful when moved.

Speaking after the inquest in Blackpool, Lancashire, Mrs Owens' family slammed the 'shocking standard of care' she received.

They said: 'The death of Freda was not just avoidable or preventable but needless and unnecessary.

'There can be no doubt that the sub-optimum care, together with the scald incident itself, resulted in unnecessary, needless and prolonged suffering.

'The verdict has been a long time coming but unfortunately it has all been too little, too late.

'Freda has died. Nothing can bring her back or undo the harm she suffered.

'It is with regret that the ripple effects of this has far reaching consequences and the pain and suffering continues for those that Freda left behind.'

Her daughter Susan Tate, 69, and granddaughter Kerry Esgate, 39, said Mrs Owens, a great-grandmother-of-four, had been living independently but suffered a fall three years ago.

They said she never returned home after injuring her wrist and was placed straight into the care home by the hospital.

Micaila Williams, representing the family, told the court that Mrs Owens developed a pressure sore in October 2012, which 'wasn't managed properly'.

Referring to the burns she suffered from the commode, she said: 'No practice was in place to allow that procedure to take place.

'It was inherently risky and dangerous and the water wasn't tested and the pressure sore was under-assessed by district nurses.

'Due to the burns, she was unable to move properly and risk of further pressure sores heightened.

'The district nurse wasn't made aware and there was a lack of communication that clearly led to difficulties moving forward.'

Mr Wilson said: 'Freda was placed in a commode in her room at her care home in the hope steam would ease constipation.

The coroner concluded that two factors contributed to Mrs Owens' death - the burns she suffered as a result of the commode and the delay in treatment this caused for her pressure sore

'This unintentionally resulted in burns and scalds.

'On November 21, she was examined but that didn't include assessment of her left hip area and she deteriorated.

'On November 23, she was hospitalised and it was not until December 24 that the injury to her left hip was recognised as a pressure sore.

'There was a delay in treatment which could have affected the outcome.

'I don't find failings at the care home as a whole, aside from the action of the individual carer who utilised the commode.'

Mr Wilson returned a narrative verdict and accepted evidence given by Dr Alison Armer, a pathologist at the Royal Preston Hospital, who reported the cause of death as being bronchial pneumonia due to necrotic, chronic pressure ulcer to the left hip and burns or scalds to the buttock.

A pre-inquest hearing earlier this year revealed police had spoken to the carer, who poured boiling water into the commode, and the Crown Prosecution Service about the incident at the the care home.

But it was decided the care worker should not be prosecuted.

A member of staff at the care home said the manager was not available for comment this evening.
