There were no injuries.

In trouble: Authorities in New Hampshire are investigating an Exeter car crash which left a vehicle standing straight up in the air with only its nose in the snow

By the time authorities showed up at the scene, the woman behind the wheel already got out, according to the website.

Yahoo News! reported that authorities continue to investigate, and that the 37-year-old woman 'told authorities she did not know how she had lost control of the car.'

Images of the car sticking straight up in the snow appeared Wednesday afternoon on the Facebook page for the New Hampshire Trooper's Association.

Along with the images, the Trooper's Association wrote 'Trooper Preneveau investigated this crash on Route 101 westbound in Exeter this morning. Operating too fast for the conditions?' 

Several people made humorous comments about the position the car ended up in, among them Bill Ganley. Yahoo! News pointed out  Ganley's observation that a car in 2011 also wound up standing straight in the air in Salem. 

Kristine Wilber Peckham wrote on Facebook that the car 'Nailed that landing!' 

Several other users offered 'scores' for the car involved in the accident.

Jennifer Dispensa said 'I'd give them a perfect 10, but only after investigating for performance enhancing drugs.' 

Kathy Barte was more critical, however, writing 'This rates a score of 8.'

Tony Ferraro even posted a shot of judges from the ABC reality show competition  'Dancing with the Stars' all holding up signs of 10, indicating a perfect score.

'Nailed it...' Ferraro wrote.
