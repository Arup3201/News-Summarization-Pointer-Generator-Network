A widow of 94 was left with appalling injuries after an attacker carried out a sickening assault on her as she slept in her bed.

Carers were horrified to find Emma Winnall unconscious and covered in blood when they arrived at her home on Tuesday morning.

The great-grandmother remains 
seriously ill following emergency surgery. The assault also left her 
with a broken arm and wrist and one of her fingers was partially 
severed.

Brutally beaten: This picture released by detectives shows the horrific injuries sustained by 94-year-old Emma Winnall after being attacked by intruders while asleep at her home in Birmingham

Whoever attacked her on Monday evening took nothing from her home, and police are yet to establish any motive.

Yesterday Mrs Winnall’s family 
released a picture of her dreadful  injuries in the hope it might lead 
to information that could help police find the culprit.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarb Johal, 
of West Midlands Police, said: ‘This is a truly sickening attack on a 
defenceless, frail lady as she slept in her own home.

‘We believe an implement of some sort 
was used during the assault and our forensics experts are scouring the 
property in the hope of shedding some light on exactly what happened.

No motive established: Police step up patrols and carry out door-to-door enquiries around the area of the block of flats where Mrs Winnall was attacked on Monday night

‘Mrs Winnall had nothing of note to 
steal. It was a senseless assault and I’d urge anyone with suspicions 
about who may be responsible to get in touch straight away

‘She suffered very nasty injuries and ones which, given her age, could well have been life-threatening.’

Mrs Winnall, of Moseley, Birmingham, 
worked at the city’s small arms factory during the Second World War. 
She  relies on a wheelchair to get around, and has lived alone since her
husband Frank died in 2006 aged 91.

life

Some of her five children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren were at her hospital bedside yesterday.

Friends of the pensioner said they had been worried about people entering her property through a broken fence.

Arshad Butt, 90, a neighbour of Mrs Winnall’s for 25 years, said: ‘I am devastated that this has happened to her.

‘It’s normally a very nice area, but recently I’d been concerned about some broken fences at the front of our garden.

'The fence has been broken down and I’d noticed a lot of unsavoury-looking people walking through our garden, and using it as a shortcut.

‘I haven’t felt safe recently with so many people I don’t know coming so close to our houses.’

Another neighbour, Falak Naz Siddiqi, 59, said of Mrs Winnall: ‘She is very poorly, very weak. I sometimes see her daughter pushing her in her wheelchair.

‘I don’t know how someone could do this to someone that can’t move. She is an old, frail lady. It is a shame. She would not harm anyone.’
