An unedifying end to Group D provided Celtic with a simple lesson. Defend even remotely as poorly as this and their Europa League campaign will end at the last-32 stage.

Ronny Deila had hoped to see positive signs for the future from this pressure-free dead rubber played amid a ghostly ambience. Instead, the lifeless way the Parkhead side went about combating Dinamo’s attacking threats provided cause for much head-scratching concern.

The Croats are hardly a continental force. Whichever side comes out of the hat in Monday’s draw for the first knockout round will possess significantly superior quality. But Deila’s men allowed them to every opportunity to impress — with full-back Adam Matthews having a particularly lamentable evening — and that hospitality was warmly accepted.

Marko Pjaca claimed a hat-trick for the hosts, while Marcelo Brozovic also found a way past Craig Gordon. It should be noted that, once again, the goalkeeper was Celtic’s best player in a European outing, notching a clutch of worthy saves to prevent the scoreline swelling further.

All in all, this was pretty shambolic fare with a string of faintly comical concessions at both ends of the field.

There were times when Dinamo entered into a pact of non-defending. Kris Commons and Stefan Scepovic were on target as Celtic briefly led during the first half. An own goal from Josip Pivaric then gave the Scottish champions hope of avoiding a fifth European defeat of the season but it ultimately went unfulfilled.

Yes, there were changes to Deila’s line-up with only prize money and co-efficient points at stake. But they were all in more advanced areas. Those at the back will have to do better – much, much better – if Celtic are to keep an edge of glamour to their campaign come the spring.

Having also conceded three to Red Bull Salzburg in their previous Europa League outing, Deila may now view defensive reinforcement as a rising priority come the January window.

Maybe it was case of playing down to the surroundings, given that the Maksimir Stadium provided swathes of empty blue seats as a backdrop.

The dismal attendance wasn’t solely down to the inconsequential nature of proceedings, as Dinamo’s hardcore fans have been calling for a boycott in protest at the direction their club has taken. A haul of three points from their opening five Group D games also led to a demand for a public apology from the players. It has not been a happy camp.

More than 1,000 Celtic fans had made the trek to Croatia, presumably having booked up in anticipation of this being a decisive contest. They at least added a little pocket of noise to an otherwise eerie atmosphere, although the sight of a flare being lit at kick-off was unwelcome given the club’s previous brushes with UEFA.

A fringe of mist hung over the stadium as the temperature dipped towards zero. It was cold enough to make one think fondly about a January fixture in Dingwall.

Deila’s selection contained some of the anticipated alterations – with Scepovic and Wakaso Mubarak introduced – but the back four from Saturday’s 1-0 win over Motherwell was retained in the hope of providing a stable base. It didn’t quite work out.

Dinamo had threatened early on when Pivaric cut the ball back for skipper Domagoj Antolic, whose low shot was thwarted by an Efe Ambrose block. El Arbi Hilal Soudani was then offside as he found the net, but a home breakthrough duly arrived after 14 minutes.

The Croats pressed around the penalty area, with Arijan Ademi eventually miscuing a shot that fell perfectly for Pjaca. He cut on to his right foot, leaving Matthews spinning in his wake, before placing a calm finish beyond Gordon and inside the far post. Celtic could point to a degree of misfortune but Matthews was skinned all too easily.

Dinamo’s defence had been disrupted after 11 minutes when Jeremy Tavarel sustained a head knock and had to be replaced by Jozo Simumovic. And their revised line-up was undone in a rather strange fashion as Deila’s men dragged themselves level in the 24th minute.

The ball spun high into the air after Virgil van Dijk – captain for the evening after Scott Brown was left home to avoid a suspension risk – smacked a free-kick into the defensive wall. Zagreb goalkeeper Eduardo was motionless as Commons reacted quickest to divert into the net via what looked like a mix of head and shoulder. As a concession, it was sponge-soft.

Celtic were emboldened by the equaliser and promptly pushed themselves in front six minutes later. Again, a direct free-kick was key as Commons curled a terrific effort against the bar after being toppled just outside the area. Nir Biton headed back towards goal and Scepovic turned it beyond Eduardo. The Serbian striker lifted up his shirt to reveal a ‘Happy Birthday my love’ message as he raced off towards the Celtic fans in celebration, earning a booking from Lithuania referee Gediminas Mazeika.

The lead didn’t last long. The final act of a first half with all the defensive merits of tissue-paper armour arrived six minutes from the interval.

An Ambrose challenge inside the area sent the ball to Matthews, only for the Welshman to trip over and continue his angst-ridden evening. Pjaca accepted the gift with gratitude, beating Gordon with the aid of a deflection off Bitton.

Whatever was said in the dressing room didn’t cure Celtic’s ills. In fact, they merely fragmented further. Gordon had to save from Soudani and Pjaca in quick succession after the restart, yet had no hope of preventing Zagreb from going back in front after 48 minutes.

Antolic outpaced Matthews on Celtic’s right flank and pulled the ball back for Brozovic on the 18-yard line. His first-time finish was exquisite, curling fractionally inside the post as Gordon clutched at air.

A fourth Croatian goal then followed with indecent haste. Pjaca got in front of Van Dijk to advance menacingly before crashing a 20-yard strike into the net and completing his treble.

It was bleak viewing from a Parkhead perspective. Matthews was put out of his misery as Darnell Fisher became the first substitute introduced by Deila. Liam Henderson soon followed in place of the ineffective Callum McGregor.

Celtic didn’t really stir again until Pivaric reached an Emilio Izaguirre cross just ahead of Scepovic but succeeded only in finding his own net with nine minutes left.

Henderson then saw a dipping effort tipped over by Eduardo before Scepovic was painfully close with a glancing header. The damage had, though, already been done at the other end.
