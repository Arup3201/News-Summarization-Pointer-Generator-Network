Lost: Lady Bathurst, a friend of Prince Charles had her £600 cigarette case stolen by Anthony Leyshon

Thousands of pounds of items belonging to guests were stolen by a thief at a glittering society ball, a court heard.

Public relations worker Anthony Leyshon, took possessions, including a £600 cigarette case owned by a friend of Prince Charles’, Lady Bathurst, when he attended the Cirencester Polo Club Charity Ball.

He stored the stolen property, belonging to three guests, at his workplace, magistrates in Cheltenham were told.

The 43-year-old pleaded guilty to three counts of theft from Foxcote Manor in Andoversford, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Leyshon took eight glass vases, a glass bowl, a rug, three table lanterns and a bottle of vodka belonging to the owner of the property, Tamara Vestey.

He also took Lady Bathurst’s bag worth about £500, which containing the valuable silver cigarette case.

Another handbag valued at about £500 was stolen from guest Alexa Newton.

Prosecutor Derek Ryder said: 'The defendant had come to the ball with his then partner who was driving the car, and when the car left it contained the handbags and other items from the ball such as the vases, lanterns and rug.

'The matters didn’t come to light until later when the defendant fell out with his partner and the incident was reported to the defendant’s employer.'

He added that the handbags had been 
given by the defendant to his ex-partner’s mother as a present, but a 
credit card revealed the bag’s rightful owner.

He said all the items were returned in the summer of 2011 after the investigation involved Gwent and Gloucestershire police.

Defending, Mark Lacey, said: 'All of the items have been returned and he has suffered as a result of the proceedings.”

Mr Lacey said Leyshon, of Bute Crescent, Cardiff, had been sacked as a PR representative in Cardiff and was now getting state benefits worth £160 each fortnight.

He added: 'He accepts he has brought shame upon himself and has caused people harm as a result of them being deprived of the property.'

Chairman of the bench Mark Johnson sentenced Leyshon to 120 hours of unpaid work.

He has to pay £200 court costs and £75 witness expenses.

Lady Bathurst of Cirencester Park, Glos, is a close friend of Prince Charles and his sons, who have all regularly played polo on the estate she runs with husband Lord Bathurst.
