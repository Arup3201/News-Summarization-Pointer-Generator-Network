FA President Prince William has called on England's footballers to inspire a nation like the Olympic athletes did last year

The Duke of Cambridge has said he wants England's football players to take up the Olympic legacy and inspire the next generation.

Speaking at the 150th anniversary gala of the FA, Prince William, the association's president, praised those who had helped develop the sport.

He also said that 'more work needs to be done' to rid the sport of racism after Manchester City's Yaya Toure complained of monkey chants from CSKA Moscow fans.

The Duke said: 'I am proud of the work of Kick it Out, which is also celebrating an anniversary - its 20th - this year.

'There is sadly more work to do, but it is heartening to see how seriously the FA takes stamping the blight of racism and discrimination out of football.

Praising the FA, he added: 'Tonight is not just an English celebration'

'Football is international in every possible way and I believe that the game's constantly evolving spirit and appeal is a consolidation of all its global influences. Every nation should be proud of their contribution to 150 years of football.

'With all that in mind, I consider my position as President of The FA to be an honour and a privilege.'

Addressing dignitaries such as FIFA president Sepp Blatter, his UEFA counterpart Michel Platini and England manager Roy Hodgson, Prince William said: 'Our national players are role models for millions of young people and I think we need to give those highly pressured and driven players the support and training they need to live up to their rightly exalted status.

'We were as a nation so proud of our 
Team GB athletes at the Olympics and Paralympics, for their success on 
the field but also for the way they conducted themselves in interviews 
and with their competitors.

'It is perfectly possible to say the 
same about our national teams - they are good people, ambitious for 
success and to a man and woman aware of their status as role models.'

The Duke went on to congratulate Hodgson for qualifying for the next World Cup in 2014 in Rio and praised FA chairman Greg Dyke for setting up a commission to improve the national team  

'I am glad to see that, under the new
Chairman and Commission, there is renewed vigour to improve the 
competitive quality of our national game, for all our sakes,' William 
added.

'But I would also encourage us to make sure we retain sportsmanship at the heart of this energetic drive for success

'Regrettably, Her Majesty's reign 
includes only one time that England won the World Cup, but I know that 
Greg and Roy are trying to make up for lost time now.'

In a separate speech, Greg Dyke, who 
replaced the old FA chairman David Bernstein in July, also praised the 
work of anti-racist campaigners and said he was hopeful about the future
of the sport.

He said: 'There has been a huge historical focus this year, and rightly so.

'We
should be proud of what our founders created and what The FA has 
continued in their name. But we should also be proud of what we are 
currently doing.

'Our consistent theme across the year 
has been to celebrate The FA's support for the grassroots game which has
always been fundamental to The FA's role in football.

'At
every turn, we have highlighted the work done right across the country 
by 400,000 volunteers and also highlighted what is being achieved with 
the £100m we put back into the game every year.

'We are all privileged to spend our days involved in football, to wake up in the morning and go to bed at night with football in our lives. We sincerely owe a debt of thanks to Ebenezer Morley and his contemporaries for the work they did 150 years ago.

'But with that involvement comes responsibility, responsibility for ensuring that football continues in good health, responsibility for ensuring it continues to thrive.

'Here in England The FA's task is to ensure as many people as possible can get involved in the game.'

Dyke also used the occasion to remember those who lost their lives in incidents at Hillsborough, Valley Parade and Burnden Park.
