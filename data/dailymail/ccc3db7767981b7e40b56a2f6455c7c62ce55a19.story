Sentenced: English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, 31, has been jailed for 18 months for mortgage fraud

English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson has been jailed for 18 months for mortgage fraud.

The 31-year-old, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had previously admitted two counts of the offence at a hearing in November.

In an apparent comment on the sentencing at St Albans Crown Court, the controversial figure took to Twitter to say 'This is a complete stitch-up'.

He also posted a picture of a meal of meat, mashed potatoes and chips, with the message 'one last feed', and then 'see u all in 18 months'.

Robinson was accused of conspiring with others to obtain a mortgage by misrepresentation from the Abbey and Halifax banks.

The fraud amounted to £160,000 over a period of six months. 

Robinson has previously served time in jail for using someone else’s passport to travel to the United States.

He was given 10 months at Southwark Crown Court in January 2013 after admitting possession of a false identity document with improper intention.

During the course of last year he also had a series of brushes with the law when police tried to restrict marches by the EDL in the wake of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.

Robinson, who also has convictions for assault, drug and public order offences, quit the group in October, claiming he had concerns over far-right extremism.

Since leaving the far right group he has pledged to help tackle racism in Britain, and prior to his sentencing had been due to embark on a tour of schools, lecturing pupils on tolerance.

One last feed: Robinson posted pictures of his chicken and chips, writing 'One last feed', before adding 'See u all in 18 months when I've lost all this weight'

He said that he was sorry for creating
 an 'us and them' culture and for causing fear among British Muslims, 
having previously claimed 'every single Muslim' was to blame for 
'getting away' with the July 7 bombings.

Robinson has been mentored by deradicalisation think tank, the Quilliam Foundation, since he quit his post.

Robinson,
 who was also a BNP member, founded the EDL in 2009 because he was angry
 that Muslims demonstrated as British troops returned from Afghanistan.

He has been arrested at various demonstrations and was jailed for using someone else's passport to fly to America.

A convicted football hooligan, he was also arrested in May 2012, after allegedly obstructing police as he tried to get close to the spot in Woolwich where Lee Rigby was murdered.

Since he left the EDL he has said that his past inflammatory statements had often been fuelled by alcohol and the adrenaline rush of 'leading the biggest street protest movement in Europe.'

Giving reason for his decision to leave the group, Mr Robinson said he had been sobered by his 18-week stint in prison and by the experience of being shunned by parents when picking up his children at school.
