Not content with journeying to remote lands, Google Street View has now decided to go underwater.

Using scooters with specially-designed cameras, divers are currently documenting sea life from the bottom of Sydney Harbour as well as the waters of Bondi and Manly beaches.

The images, created with the help of Catlin Seaview Survey, could provide scientists with information about how the harbour is changing and reveal the incredible marine life beneath the surface to its one billion viewers.

Over the next eight months, Google will collect images for a launch at the World Parks Congress being held in Sydney this November

To create the amazing underwater images, Google and the Caitlin survey developed the first ever
tablet-operated underwater cameras.

Complete with their own propulsion system, the images are captured through a spherical camera housing that allows continuous high-resolution, 360-degree  imagery to be collected as divers steer through the reefs.

On a typical run it will capture over 1000 panoramas, which are then stitched together to produce a virtual dive experience.

So far ship wrecks, pink boulders, bull sharks, bright green kelp beds and discarded bathtubs have all been uncovered as part of Google’s adventures in Sydney.

‘We tend to think of the harbour as a monolithic and flat surface, but people will be blown away by what is happening underneath,’ Professor Emma Johnston, from the Sydney Institute of Marine Science told IBT Times.

‘The amazing kelp forests, underwater gardens of sea tulips and sponges and fish that they have never seen. The diversity of sea life is greater than any harbour in the world.’

The first ever tablet-operated underwater camera, dubbed SVII, is being used to take the footage.

One of the challenges is the turbidity of the harbour water would probably prevent them from filming further west than Double Bay and no deeper than 10 metres

The camera has already attracted the attention of bull sharks, which are prevalent in the area, because of the electrical impulses created by the equipment.

As well as sharks, one of the challenges facing Google is the turbidity of the harbour water would probably prevent them from filming further west than Double Bay and no deeper than 10 metres.

Similar surveys have previously taken place on the Great Barrier Reef and Galapagos Island.

The project's launch comes as Google began using its all-seeing backpack contraption called ‘Trekker’ in Sydney last month.

Google Trekker uses a 4ft, 40lb backpack fitted with a 15-angle lens camera to take 360-degree pictures every 2.5 seconds in public places, with the images added to Street View on Google Maps.

Trekker is being used to collect imagery of places only accessible by foot to incorporate into Street View.
