'Curmudgeonly': The host o Radio 4’s Today programme revealed his daughter had nominated him for the challenge - but has dismissed it as a 'stunt'

It has been embraced by pop stars and politicians and raised millions for charity.

But BBC presenter John Humphrys has criticised the Ice Bucket Challenge as a ‘stunt’, saying we should give because we want to help good causes, not because of fads.

The host of Radio 4’s Today programme revealed his daughter had nominated him for the challenge – in which people donate money after filming themselves being doused in ice water, before nominating someone else.

Famous participants include former US president George Bush, pop star Justin Bieber, David Beckham and Hollywood star Tom Cruise, raising more than £60million for US motor neurone charity the ALS Association, and more than £3million for Macmillan Cancer Support in the UK.

But Mr Humphrys, 71, said: ‘It’s certainly been hugely successful at raising awareness of the hideous motor neurone disease and it’s undoubtedly raised a lot of money.

‘But as someone who set up his own modest charity a few years ago, I have mixed feelings about persuading people to support a charity with stunts.

‘Is it too sanctimonious to say that charity should be about giving because it’s a worthwhile cause that we really want to help?’

Writing in Waitrose Weekend magazine, he added: ‘Still, it’s preferable to all those appeals from people who ask for your help for something they’re madly keen to do anyway.

‘We’ve all had the letters: “I plan to raise loads of money for my local cats’ home by cycling around Cuba. Please help!”

‘I’m always tempted to reply: “If you really want to help your local cats’ home, why not stay home and give them all the money it will cost to send you on a lovely holiday?” Mr Humphrys – who has a son and daughter with his first wife Edna and a 13-year-old son with BBC presenter Valerie Sanderson – set up the Kitchen Table Charities Trust in 2005.

Its purpose is to raise money for other small charities that do not have their own fundraising arms, and it is opposed to ‘charity as big business’.

Mr Humphrys admitted his views might seem a little ‘curmudgeonly’, but he said he was dismayed when his editor on Today recently joked that he would be expected to complete the Ice Bucket Challenge on air. Describing his immediate reaction, he said: ‘Unwelcome and, given a moment’s thought, unlikely – but just about plausible.

I should be so plucky: Kylie Minogue completes the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge alongside her designer friend Stefano Gabbana 

‘It wouldn’t be the first time we’d done something daft on Today and, given the relentless tide of dire news over the summer, maybe the audience needed a bit of a break.

‘But not this! Not on Today! Surely my editor was winding me up. He was. Crisis and potential presenter rebellion averted.’

He added: ‘The problem is, charity has become big business and fundraising is all about clever marketing. Pity they can’t let the cause speak for itself.’
