Emails cache: Stevie Deans, the union official at the heart of the Grangemouth oil refinery crisis, quit his job before he could be sacked after he was accused of using company time to conduct Labour party business

The union official at the heart of the Grangemouth oil refinery crisis quit his job last night, piling more pressure on Ed Miliband to re-open an investigation into his conduct.

Stevie Deans was Unite’s convenor at the plant and was facing the sack from bosses Ineos after they discovered he used company time to conduct Labour party business.

Around 1,000 emails – now in the hands of police – appeared to link Mr Deans and other Unite associates to Labour’s selection of its candidate in Falkirk.

Last night Mr Deans quit before he could be fired – but he remains chairman of the local party and is Unite’s convenor in Scotland.

Sources at Ineos said Mr Deans spent up to a quarter of his work time on party business, while sending and receiving more than 1,000 emails from his work laptop.

The damning findings follow accusations that Mr Deans tried to rig the selection of a candidate to replace disgraced Falkirk MP Eric Joyce by signing up new union members to the Labour Party without their knowledge.

A Labour inquiry and a police probe were dropped after  witnesses withdrew statements.

However emails from Mr Deans and other Unite officials suggest that solicitors for the union drafted the retractions, which were then approved by Mr Deans. These and other emails are being scrutinised by Scotland’s police economic crime unit, heaping pressure on Mr Miliband.

It is the latest blow to the Labour leader who has been trying to fight accusations he is too close to Unite, the party’s biggest donor which has given £8.4million since he became party chief.

Unite’s general secretary Len McCluskey has also tried to flex his muscle over party policy and candidates. He and other Unite figures threatened to boycott Labour’s conference unless Mr Deans and the Left-wing candidate Karie Murphy were reinstated to the party.

Unite also threatened a strike over Ineos’ decision to investigate Mr Deans. This was blamed for a stand-off which saw Grangemouth almost close its petrochemical plant, with the loss of 800 jobs, last week.

Conservative
 Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Stevie Deans’ resignation is yet 
another reason why Ed Miliband must finally act. He must publish the 
internal Labour inquiry into Falkirk.

‘Ed Miliband should also open a
 new inquiry, to investigate properly the initial allegations of 
selection rigging and Unite’s attempt to subvert the internal inquiry. 
If Ed Miliband backs down to Len McCluskey yet again, how can he 
possibly stand up for hard-working people?’

A spokesman for Mr 
Miliband signalled the Labour Party investigation would only be reopened
 once police had finished their inquiries. He said: ‘Information has 
been handed to the police. It is right to let that police process take 
its course. After that process is complete we will decide whether 
further action is necessary.’ 

Dispute: His suspension had previously triggered a dramatic stand-off, culminating in the shock closure of the petrochemical plant (pictured). This was only reversed at the 11th hour after the union backed down

Mr Deans’ resignation was announced in
 a statement from Ineos, which said: ‘Mr Stephen Deans has today 
resigned from the company with immediate effect.’

The convener, a former welder who has worked at Grangemouth for 24 years, declined to comment on his resignation.

Answering
 the door to his smart bungalow on an executive estate near Falkirk, he 
appeared tired and said: ‘Sorry, I’m not interested.’ 

He has vigorously
 denied that he and others tried to rig the Falkirk selection process.

Mr
 Joyce, still an independent MP for Falkirk, said yesterday: ‘Ineos have
 got Mr Deans bang to rights and these emails are entirely damning.’
