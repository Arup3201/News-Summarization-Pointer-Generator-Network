A former banker who ran an insider trading scheme described as the worst to ever come before an Australian court has been jailed for seven years after making $7 million.

Lukas James Kamay, 26, used leaked market sensitive data provided before its official release by Christopher Russell Hill, 25, to make  millions on the stock market.

He used some of the money to buy an apartment renovated on the Nine Network's television show The Block, before his assets were frozen by federal police.

Kamay from Clifton Hill, north-west of Melbourne, pleaded guilty to six charges of insider trading, one charge of money laundering and two charges of identity theft.

He must serve four years and six months before being eligible for parole.

Hill, from Belconnen in the ACT, was jailed for three years and three months, with a minimum of two years to be served, for providing embargoed Australian Bureau of Statistics data to Kamay.

However, he was unaware of the extent of Kamay's trading.

Kamay and Hill had agreed to use the ABS data to make about $200,000 which, after the proper taxes were paid, would result in a net profit of about $50,000 each.

After a series of trades that netted the pair about $195,000, including some deliberate losses to mimic a normal trade, Kamay opened additional accounts he hid from Hill. 

The former banker used some of the money to successfully bid $2.375 million on a three bedroom apartment renovated by twins Alisa and Lysandra on The Block. 

He paid a $500,000 deposit on the Albert Park apartment.  

Victorian Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said Kamay's earnings constituted the largest insider trading profit to come before an Australian court.

'Mr Hill had no idea you, Mr Kamay, had gone so far beyond the original $200,000 limit,' she said.

Kamay made a net profit of $7 million over a series of 45 trades.

For his role in the scheme, Hill was paid about $20,000.

'Insider trading is a serious criminal offence because it can undermine the integrity of markets and diminish public confidence in the commercial world.'

Justice Hollingworth said is was a form of cheating.

'Your motivation was personal greed, pure and simple,' she told the pair.
