A man says that he had sex with his sister-in-law in order to help her conceive and now she is suing saying that he sexually assaulted her.

Ted McCullough says that he had sex with his sister-in-law Adrienne Mesko, and that she is now claiming he sexually assaulted her because she doesn't want to admit to her family that she wanted to have sex with him rather than receive IVF treatments.

Mesko is now accusing him of sexual assault, a claim that McCullough claims is false and has filed a $7million lawsuit to fight.

According to The New York Post, McCullough says that he and Mesko had a two-day tryst in Hyde Park, an area of upstate New York in Duchess County where she lives and he has a weekend home.

The date of the alleged encounter is unclear, but court documents lay out other various details.

At one point, 'she pulled her naked legs up in a crab-like position to increase the chances of conception. She then stated to him, "Thank you, I know you are doing me a favor."'

She did not conceive after their relations and is not pregnant.

Mesko's husband, Gregory Chiaramonte, is the brother of McCullough's wife Deirdre Chiaramonte. McCullough apparently was willing to have sex with his wife's sister-in-law out of respect for his brother-in-law. He apparently thinks that Gregory would make a 'fine, responsible and upstanding father'.

McCullough's wife does not apparently think the same about her own husband, however, as DeirdreÂ  has filed for divorce.

The couple, who have two children, are reportedly trying to work things out.

Chiaramonte works as the director of The Tina Santi Flaherty Rehabilitation and Fitness service at The Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, while her husband is a partner at a law firm.

According to the biography on his website, McCullough 'handles complex commercial cases including class action work, contract and commercial suits, products liability, intellectual property, environmental and employment disputes' at the firm McCullough Ginsberg Montano & Partners.
