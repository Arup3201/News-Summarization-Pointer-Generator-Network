Iago Aspas has a better goals-per-minute ratio than Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Neymar this season.

The Liverpool forward, on loan at La Liga side Sevilla, has amassed an impressive record of one goal every 71 minutes in all competitions this term.

Although notable in itself, the statistic becomes more impressive when compared to the biggest names in world football. Ballon d'Or holder Ronaldo for example, who has scored a goal every 72 minutes, and Messi - one goal every 82.

Messi's Barcelona team-mate Neymar, who has impressed with 22 goals already this season, has a goal every 87 minutes. In fact, Aspas' record is the best of every major league in the world.

To put the statistic into context, Aspas has only scored 10 goals in his 19 games this season. He hasn't played as many minutes as the likes of Ronaldo and Messi, but has managed to net regularly when he has taken to the pitch.

Seven of Aspas' strikes have come in the Copa del Rey - six of them against one club. Sevilla travelled to lowly Sabadell in October, beating them 6-1, and the Liverpool man scored a hat-trick.

The Liverpool loanee has also recorded a better ratio than the two best players in world football

In the reverse fixture in December there was another rout, and Aspas again scored a hat-trick in a 5-1 win, taking the aggregate score to 11-2.

To give credit to Aspas, he has taken his incredible cup form to La Liga in the last fortnight, scoring in consecutive fixtures against Espanyol and the might of Real Madrid.

Whether or not he will be given the chance to impress at Anfield is yet to be seen, but if the 27-year-old can continue his form at Sevilla, Brendan Rodgers will be keeping a close eye on his player.
