The resignation of David Petraeus, sparked by the revelation that the former general was having an affair with his biographer, is the biggest sex scandal to hit Washington since Bill Clinton was revealed to have had 'sexual relations' with Monica Lewinsky.

And the parallels between the two events are growing stronger as it has been revealed that both Petraeus' mistress and the whistleblower who exposed them have hired legal advisers who previously worked with the former White House intern.

Jill Kelley, the Florida housewife who was dragged in to the scandal when she started receiving abusive emails from an anonymous source, has hired Lewinsky's crisis manager to help her deal with the publicity she is facing after the resignation of the former CIA director.

And Paula Broadwell, who carried out an affair with Petraeus over several months after writing his biography, is being represented by an attorney from the firm which once represented Lewinsky.

Kelley has hired Abbe Lowell, the 
attorney who defended John Edwards earlier this year, and Judy Smith, 
the crisis manager who represented Lewinsky after her trysts with
President Clinton.

Broadwell's lawyer is the Washington-based Robert F. Muse, according to ABC News, a partner at Stein, Mitchell, Muse & Cipollone, which specialises in white-collar crime.

Another of the firm's partners is Jacob A. Stein, who was counsel to Lewinsky during Clinton's impeachment hearings in 1998.

The 37-year-old Kelley, who became friends with Petraeus after working alongside him as a liaison officer at MacDill Air Force Base, was seen strutting outside her Florida mansion on Monday but refused to speak openly about the furore surrounding her.

Kelley was dressed in an eye-catching canary yellow suit as
 she swooped past reporters swarming the $1.3million home she shares with her husband and their three children.

She
 climbed into her Mercedes which carries a license plate reading 
'Honorary Consul' - a nod to her unpaid work with the forces, and a sign
 she's not shy about making her high-profile contacts known.

She is said to be upset at the claim that she might have had any sort of inappropriate contact with Petraeus - 'She would say he was kind of like a grandpa to her girls,' one friend told the Daily Telegraph.

'Jill's husband Scott is very 
protective of her, and I'm sure he was the one who said go to the FBI,' a
 close friend told MailOnline about the scandal.

'They are a very close couple who are
 devoted to each other and their children. If his family was being 
threatened he would not hesitate to go to the police.

'Jill is a very strong woman, but I 
guess she must have known who these emails were coming from. She would 
have seen this Paula and seen how close she was to the General. She is 
very worldly wise and would have guessed.'

Kelley
 has insisted there was no reason for jealousy as she is nothing more 
than friends with Petraeus, whom she met when he was serving at the 
Tampa base between 2008 and 2010.

She worked as an unpaid, unofficial 
social liaison for U.S. Central Command, which Petraeus led, and was 
reportedly a fixture at parties, along with her husband Scott, a 
prominent cancer surgeon.

The official said the coalition 
countries represented at Central Command gave Mrs Kelley an appreciation
 certificate on which she was referred to as an 'honorary ambassador' to
 the coalition, but she has no official status and is not employed by 
the U.S. government.

The 
official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't 
authorized to discuss the case publicly, said Kelley is known to drop 
the 'honorary' part and refer to herself as an ambassador.

In
 recognition of her work with officials at CENTCOM, she was recently 
named as a honorary consulate general to South Korea - explaining her 
license plate.

Kelley, 
whom neighbours described as a 'skilled networker', has even boasted 
about serving dinner to Petraeus and his wife Holly in 2007.

She is also pictured with her 
husband, her twin sister, Natalie Khawam, and the Petraeuses in photos 
from a garden party at her home to celebrate the Gasparilla Festival in 
2010.

General Petraeus 
arrived with a 28 motorcycle escort and mingled with more than 200 
guests who dined on crab cakes and lamb chops.

Mrs
 Kelley, who said she has known Petraeus and Holly for five years, has 
even visited them in Washington DC. She is also reported to have been 
invited to a breakfast at the White House.

And she is said to regard Petraeus as being like a grandfather to her children, aged nine, seven and and six.

Neighbours called her a 'devoted mother' who enjoyed entertaining at her 5,000 sq ft home. Another added: 'Jill would not be seen out and about in anything other than a designer dress.

'At weekends while most women dress 
down and wear sweat pants and the like she will be fully made up and 
dressed as if she were going to a dinner.'

One neighbor said: 'Jill is very proud of her work with the military and she does all she can for them.

'She is a great morale booster and 
uses her social position as the wife of a prominent surgeon to make sure
 she makes a difference.'

At
 this year's Gasparilla festival, where pirate themed floats are driven 
through Tampa, the Kelley's hosted military officers from 60 nations to a
 coalition appreciation party.

Tight security surrounded the Kelley's home during the event.

One
 neighbour complained that it resulted in the street running alongside 
the Kelley's red and white painted mansion being closed off to traffic 
for the day.

'You soon know
 when Jill is having a party It's like having the president come to town
 as everything shuts down. There is security everywhere and you cannot 
move,' said one neighour.

On
 Sunday, as news of her involved in the scandal made her a national 
figure, she did not postpone an expensive garden party that was thrown 
for her daughter's birthday.

The gathering featured a professional DJ, an inflatable bouncy castle and catered meals and more than 100 adult guests.

It came after she found herself in the midst of the sex scandal, after Petraeus dramatically resigned on Friday as it emerged he had cheated on Holly, his wife of 38 years.

Broadwell, the married mother of two revealed to be Petraeus' mistress, reportedly sent harassing emails to Kelley saying: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy'.

The official, speaking to the New York Post, added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and thought she was in a 'lovers triangle.'

Mrs Kelley responded by calling the FBI,
 which stumbled on Broadwell's affair when agents examined her email 
account and found steamy exchanges with Petraeus.

But as she found herself at the centre of the sex scandal, friends and family were forced to maintain her own relationship with the four-star general was never anything more than friendship.

'We and our family have been friends with Gen Petraeus and his family for over five years. We respect his and his family's privacy and want the same for us and our three children,' the Kelleys said in statement on Sunday.

Dr Kelley is head of Esophageal Oncology and Surgery at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer and Research Institute in Tampa.

He pioneered minimally-invasive, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery of the esophagus and other gastrointestinal malignancies.

Mrs Kelley has a twin sister Natalie, who is a Tampa lawyer who represents corporate whistle blowers. She is in her own legal dispute with her former employer after being accused of sexual harassment.

The sisters, who are from Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, took part in 'Food Fight,' a culinary showdown for the Food Network channel in 2003.

Their Lebanese-American parents still reportedly own a restaurant in Philadelphia.
