The rise of breakfast biscuits may have seemed enough of a naughty start to the day for some but the latest food trend to hit the UK gives early birds an even sugary hit at the crack of dawn.

It comes in the form of Italy's tasty answer to ice cream - gelato.

Making its way over from Italian shores, the UK's first-ever breakfast gelato menu has launched at Comboco in Soho, London. But judging by the array of flavours, it is likely to test even the most sweetest-toothed individuals.

A sweet treat: The latest breakfast craze to hit the UK from Italy is gelato, and it comes in a range of quirky flavours

There's cereal milk gelato flavour, inspired by the sweet, starchy milk Americans are fond of adding to their breakfast bowls.

Then there is the unusual pancakes and maple syrup flavour, as well as toast with whipped butter.

For
 those on a diet, frozen yoghurt with granola may be the ideal option, and for those nursing a hangover, there
 are few more bracing starts to the day than a Bloody Mary gelato. The cocktail is re-imagined as an ice cool tomato sorbet, spiked 
with Tabasco and a heady hit of Worcestershire Sauce.

And who
 said the morning’s caffeine fix had to be in a tiny cup? Customers can 
put some rocket fuel into their day with a rich coffee ice cream, the double espresso gelato.

Depending on the recipe and the person making it, dairy-based gelato contains around 16-24 per cent sugar and 100g of the sugary treat packs around 216 calories.

However, while the breakfast ice cream may not aid dieters, it is said to help cure hangovers.

Refreshing: Another option is the £3 scoop of Bloody Mary gelato, said to help cure a hangover

The cold effect causes more blood to be sent to the brain as a defence mechanism to try to keep the brain warm.

The increased circulation is said to help your brain recover from the dreaded booze-fuelled night before.

Also on offer for £3 a scoop at Comboco are other eccentric varieties such as the rich avocado, pear and gorgonzola, the mind-boggling scrambled eggs and, for those with more expensive taste, the 
opulent truffle oil and mushroom gelato, alongside more traditional 
flavours, such as bronte pistachio, kentish strawberry and Madagascan vanilla.

Comboco was founded by ex-City worker, Ashish Saggar, and have previously created special flavours for Pacha's launch for River Island.

Speaking
 about their innovative new offering, the Comboco team said: 'Our 
Breakfast Gelato Menu is a bit of fun to cheer up the Capital after this
 dull start to the summer.

'Every
 flavour is made using the finest organic milk but we don’t recommend 
that city dwellers enjoy this indulgent treat every day…it’s just for 
special occasions!'
