Located in Diamond Creek, in Melbourne's outer north-east, the quaint cottage is expected to sell under the hammer between $180,000 to $220, 000 on November 8, making it a perfect steal for first-home buyers or developers.

In the last 12 months properties prices sold in Diamond Creek ranged between $246,000 to $550,000, Domain Group data reveals.

Built over 70 years ago, the 39 Phipps Cresent property has many interested buyers, despite it's run down appearance and overgrown plant-life. 

The 440-square-metre block, which stands in it's original condition, is half the size of other homes in the suburb, according to The Age. 

Fletchers, the property's agents, describe the cottage as 'peaceful and private', due to the garden that surrounds.  

Featuring  two smaller-sized bedroom, one dated bathroom and kitchen, the cheap property offers buyers a chance to recreate the cottage home into their dream place, without relocating.  

Close to local shopping and schools, the cheap property is expected to see competitive bidders fight for the sale at auction.

Daniel O'Regan, the property's agent from Fletchers said he expects at least four to six serious buyers at Saturday's auction.

He said the property is drawing first home buyers on a strict budget who hope to redevelop the home. 

'It's from a bygone era - it is quite amazing to walk through and inspect it,' Mr O'Regan said.

'It's a good lesson in what people used to have 60 or 70 years ago. It is very humble.'

The family home is the first property in Diamond Creek that has been offered for under $300,00 in nearly a decade. 

Phipps Cresent was put on the market after the owner, a lady in her 90s, was moved into a nursing home.
