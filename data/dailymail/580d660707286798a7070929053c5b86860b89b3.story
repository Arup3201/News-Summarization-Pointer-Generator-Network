A hair-raisingly close fly-by by Nasa's Cassini Probe aims to learn more about what lurks beneath the icy moon Enceladus's surface - and what exactly lurks in the 'geysers' of ice it spews into space.

Cassini captured a startling new picture of the jets, which a scientist claimed earlier this year could be 'snowing microbes' onto the icy moon.

Nasa's Cassini probe flew past the icy moon Enceladus just 46 miles above the surface to gauge whether there is liquid water beneath the surface - and captured an image of the moon's 'geysers' of ice as it passed by

These jets, which spew through cracks
in the moon's icy shell, could lead back to a habitable zone that is 
uniquely accessible in all the solar system.

This week, Cassini flew past the moon just 46 miles above the surface.

The radio science team is particularly interested in learning how mass is distributed under Enceladus' south polar region, which features jets of water ice, water vapor and organic compounds spraying out of long fractures.

A concentration of mass in that region could indicate subsurface liquid water - where life could lurk.

Cassini's scientists learn about the moon's internal structure by measuring variations in the gravitational pull of Enceladus against the steady radio link to NASA's Deep Space Network on Earth.Cassini's composite infrared spectrometer instrument will also be observing the side of Enceladus that always faces away from Saturn to monitor for hot spots.

The imaging camera team also plans to take images of the plume to look for variability in the jets.

Dramatic plumes, both large and small, spray water ice from many locations near the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus

‘More than 90 jets of all sizes
near Enceladus's south pole are spraying water vapor, icy particles, 
and organic compounds all over the place,’ Carolyn Porco, planetary 
scientist and leader of the Imaging Science team for Nasa’s Cassini 
spacecraft told Nasa’s Science News earlier thsi year. 

‘Cassini
has flown several times now through this spray and has tasted it. And 
we have found that aside from water and organic material, there is salt 
in the icy particles. The salinity is the same as that of Earth's 
oceans.

Cassini passed 
Enceladus first on March 27 - coming within 46 miles - then passed the 
small moon Janus with a closest approach distance of 27,000 miles 
(44,000 kilometres). And early on March 28, the spacecraft flew by Dione
at a distance of 27,000 miles (44,000 kilometres).

Thermal measurements of Enceladus's fissures have revealed temperatures as high as -120F.

‘If you add up all the heat, 16 gigawatts of thermal energy are coming out of those cracks,’ said Porco.

She
believes the small moon, with its sub-surface liquid sea, organics, and
an energy source, may host the same type of life we find in similar 
environments on Earth.

She 
said: ‘The kind of ecologies Enceladus might harbour could be like those
deep within our own planet. Abundant heat and liquid water are found in
Earth's subterranean volcanic rocks.

Scientists believe the geysers may be coming from vast seas full of microbes

‘Organisms in those rocks thrive
on hydrogen (produced by reactions between liquid water and hot rocks) 
and available carbon dioxide and make methane, which gets recycled back 
into hydrogen. And it's all done entirely in the absence of sunlight or 
anything produced by sunlight.’

But what makes Enceladus special is that its habitable zone offers itself up for easy access.

She
said: ‘It's erupting out into space where we can sample it. It sounds 
crazy but it could be snowing microbes on the surface of this little 
world. In the end, it's is the most promising place I know of for an 
astrobiology search.

‘We 
don't even need to go scratching around on the surface. We can fly 
through the plume and sample it. Or we can land on the surface, look up 
and stick our tongues out.  And voila, we have what we came for.’

Rock on: Saturn's moon Janus, which Cassini also buzzed

The source of Enceladus's heat 
appears to be Saturn itself. Researchers say Saturn's gravitational pull
causes the moon's shape to change slightly on a daily basis as it 
orbits. Flexing motions in its interior generate heat - like the heat 
you feel in a paperclip when you bend it back and forth rapidly.

Porco
said: ‘But the tidal flexing occurring now is not enough to account for
all the heat presently coming out of Enceladus. One way out of this 
dilemma is to assume that some of the heat observed today was been 
generated and stored internally in the past.’

Porco
believes Enceladus's orbit could have been much more eccentric, and the
greater the eccentricity, she says, the greater the tidal flexing and 
resulting structural variations that produce the heat. In this scenario,
the heat would have been stored inside the little moon by melting some 
of the ice to recharge the liquid sea.

She
added: ‘Now that the orbit's eccentricity has lessened, the heat 
emanating from the interior is a combination of heat produced today and 
in the past.  But since more heat is coming out presently than is being 
produced, Enceladus is in a cooling off stage and the liquid water is 
returning to ice.

‘There are models to show that it never really freezes entirely, so the eccentricity may increase again, restarting the cycle.’
