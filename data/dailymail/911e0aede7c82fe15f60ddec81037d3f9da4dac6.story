A pitch invader received more than he bargained for during the HSBC Sevens World Series match between South Africa and USA on Saturday after being kicked in the stomach by a member of the American team.

The fan decided to invade the pitch during the match and made the mistake of trying to tackle American Perry Baker. 

Baker reacted angrily, aiming a kick into the floored fan's midriff before the intruder slowly got back to his feet.

The native of Daytona Beach, Florida, got his start at the Arena Football League's Pittsburgh Power before switching sports and joining the Eagles Sevens rugby club to pursue his Olympic dream.

The Twitter-sphere was divided on Baker's conduct, with some saying that it was unsportmanlike to kick a man while he was down, while others saying that the hapless streaker brought it upon himself.

'No need to apologise,was a split second decision. He got off lightly,should have kicked him twice,' wrote supporter Tim Walsh.

But user Danny Beasley was critical of Baker's actions, tweeting: ‘you should be kicked out. Feral dogs don't deserve that treatment. Typical arrogant p****! #onyabike.'
