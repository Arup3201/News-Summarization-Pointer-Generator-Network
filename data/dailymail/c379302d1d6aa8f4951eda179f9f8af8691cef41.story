His medals tell the story of extra-ordinary acts of gallantry and a flying career so distinguished it helped to change the course of the Second World War.

Yesterday former Dambuster pilot Les Munro remained a hero to the last – by putting them up for sale in honour of his fallen comrades.

The 95-year-old RAF squadron leader, now the only surviving pilot of the legendary raid, is to auction the medals to help pay for the upkeep of Britain’s recently built memorial to the 55,573 airmen killed in the war.

Donation: Squadron Leader Les Munro, 95, pictured, who is the last surviving Dambusters commander, hopes to raise £50,000 for the Bomber Command Memorial in London by selling his war medals

Up for auction: Les Munro will sell his medal for New Zealand Order of Merit, above and, pictured left to right his medals for Distinguished Service Order, New Zealand Queen's Service Order, Distinguished Flying Cross, 1939-45 Star; Air Crew Europe Star with clasp France and Germany, Italy Star; Defence and War Medals 1939-45, New Zealand Service Medal 1939-45, and the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal

Among them is the Distinguished Service Order awarded for completing 41 operations and his Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in 21 sorties over Europe.

Yesterday he revealed he was inspired to make the selfless gesture after being moved by a visit to the Bomber Command Memorial in London.

The medals are expected to fetch around £50,000 when they are sold with his flying logs and other memorabilia this month, but Squadron Leader Munro has pledged to donate the proceeds to the RAF Benevolent Fund, the welfare charity that maintains the memorial in Green Park. 

He said he wanted to do so ‘out of comradeship’ for the airmen who never came home. 

He added it was a ‘travesty’ that the ‘magnificent memorial’ – dedicated to British and Commonwealth airmen and ground crew after a campaign led by the Daily Mail and others – was not unveiled until 2012, more than 67 years after the war ended.

Squadron Leader Munro is described as ‘one of the great heroes’ of 617 Squadron, the elite air crew responsible for some of the most strategically critical bombing successes of the war.

The men of Bomber Command suffered huge losses in the Second World War, with 45 out of every 100 airmen killed.

But permanent memorial for Bomber Command wasn't built for 67 years due to the controversy of thousands of German civilians who died during the bombings of its cities.

In 2010 German politicians called for plans for the memorial to be abandoned out of respect for the civilian casualties.

Backed by Bild, their country's biggest daily newspaper, they said the idea was offensive to the 25,000 victims of the raid on Dresden in 1945.  

Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb, a key supporter, said at the time: 'Anyone speaking against it should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.

'The whole world, including Germany, is free today because of Bomber Command's sacrifice.'

But 67 years after the war ended the £3.5million RAF memorial was created at  the Piccadilly entrance to Green Park in London. 

Built from Portlandstone, it is open to the sky with the entrance made from sections of a Halifax bomber shot down during the war. A sculpture inside marks the loss of the plane's seven crew.

Foremost among them was the 1943 precision raid that destroyed dams in Germany’s industrial heartland, crippling armament factories along the Ruhr valley.

The ‘bouncing bomb’ attack was immortalized 12 years later in the film The Dam Busters, starring Michael Redgrave.

Munro, then a flight lieutenant, was piloting one of the Lancaster bombers to the dams when the aircraft was hit by flak, smashing a gaping hole into the rear fuselage, damaging equipment vital to sighting the target and wiping out all communications. 

The crew realised they would be ‘a menace’ to their fellow airmen without radio contact, and could jeopardise the entire mission by carrying on. 

Against difficult odds, Munro saved the lives of his crew by flying the plane home safely, still carrying its specially designed mine. 

The raid claimed the lives of 53 of the 133 crew on the mission, among them eight commanding officers.

Wing Commander Guy Gibson, who led the mission and received the Victoria Cross, said he was ‘a most charming fellow – one of those types who can always be relied upon to do the right thing at the right moment’.

Munro, promoted afterwards to squadron leader, went on to lead successful raids on German arms factories, rocket sites and U-boat pens all over Europe.

After the war he returned to his native New Zealand, where his Glasgow-born father had emigrated in 1903 to become a shepherd and start a family.

His New Zealand medals for post-war service in regional politics are being sold with his other medals and campaign stars at the auction in London on March 25. 

Christopher Hill, of auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, described him as ‘a remarkable man whose spirit of adventure never left him’.

Mike Neville, RAF Benevolent Fund director of strategy and fundraising, said: ‘Les will consider it a small sacrifice compared to the sacrifice made by thousands of comrades in the war.’
