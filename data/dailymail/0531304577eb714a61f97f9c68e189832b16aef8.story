Time Lord to crime lord: Matt Smith will take up the role of serial killer Pat Bateman

Doctor Who star Matt Smith appears in a new guise today – as the star of a musical that transports him back to the Eighties.

Over the weekend he was  shooting his final scenes as the Time Lord for the Doctor Who Christmas special.

Today he begins rehearsals for a musical version of Bret Easton Ellis’s controversial novel American Psycho, about a Wall Street serial killer. It starts at London’s Almeida Theatre in December.

The 30 year old actor is the eleventh iteration of Dr Who. The twelfth will be Peter Capaldi.

Smith begins rehearsals today (Monday) for a musical version of Brett Easton Ellis’s controversial novel American Psycho about Patrick Bateman a fictional 1980s Wall Street investment banker who engages in twisted, sick, sadistic, misogynistic fantasies involving rape, mutilation, torture and cannibalism.

‘It’s a damn difficult role to pull off and Smith has charm and the acting chops to do it’, a source close to the production told the Daily Mail.

‘It’s bold casting and brave for Smith to take it on’, the source added.

The show, which starts previewing at London’s Almeida Theatre on December 3, has been described as a satirical commentary of the materialism and greed that marked the Eighties.

Characters are deeply concerned with looks, fashion,money and status and care for little else.

If the show garners critical acclaim, it will transfer to the West End,and eventually Broadway. There are already American producers involved.

Smith’s casting has been shrouded in secrecy with just a handful of the musical’s creative team being in the know. Cast members weren’t being told who their leading man would be until rehearsals start today.

Although Smith’s an accomplished stage actor, having starred  on the London stage in dramas such as That Face, The History Boys and Swimming With Sharks, leading a musical is an altogether different business.

Smith’s known to be a strong singer but he has had a series of singing lessons to stretch his vocal range , to make it easier to get through eight performances a week.

Plus, he will need to be able to shake it up on the dance floor because the show’s director Rupert Goold ,has introduced  several dance numbers.

The score by Duncan Sheik, who wrote the show Spring Awakening, features songs that celebrate Bateman’s obsessions with fashion and food.

One number has the cast gyrating to a number about Chanel, Gucci and Armani while another is set in a gym.

In the novel Bateman prepares for his grisly deeds by citing lyrics from songs by Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins and Whitney Houston.

Although Sheik has written an original score it’s not yet known whether elements from songs connected to those singers will be incorporated into American Psycho in some way.

In the book, a shocking indictment of yuppidom, Bateman’s crimes become increasingly repellent and when fellow workers see him splattered with blood  he jokes his way out if it by claiming the blood is cranberry juice.

When he introduces the topic of serial killers in conversation his listeners  think he’s referring to the cut and thrust of mergers and aquisitions.

A movie version of American Psycho, with Christian Bale as Bateman, was able to shock without resorting to showing the most graphic and repugnant aspects of Ellis’s book.

Roberto Aguirre Sacasa ,who has adapted the story for the stage,described the show as a ‘perverse, dark, twisted version of the American Dream’ while director Rupert Goold called it ‘very sexy and really stylish'.

American Psycho has an official opening night on December 12 after previews which begin on December 3.
