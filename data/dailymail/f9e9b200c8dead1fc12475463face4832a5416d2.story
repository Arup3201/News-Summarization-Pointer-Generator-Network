Failed Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney broke out a Hawaiian shirt and beaded necklace this weekend for the wedding of Sen. John McCain's son.

Romney wore the garish getup to a rehearsal dinner at San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel  on Friday, the night before the wedding of Navy Lieutenant Jack McCain, 27, to Air Force reservist Renee Swift, 29.

McCain's daughter, Meghan, tweeted a picture of herself and Romney in his themed button-up and the photo quickly went viral online, overshadowing just about everything else about the lavish weekend celebration.

Lavish: Senator John McCain tweeted a picture of himself toasting the happy couple

The fashion decision by Romney appeared 
to be in line with a few other guests at the dinner, so we're assuming 
it was a themed party.

The tweeted photo was just one of several that Meghan McCain posted throughout the weekend.

'Can't believe my baby brothers 
getting married tomorrow,' tweeted Meghan, moments after tweeting a 
picture of herself with Romney at the rehearsal dinner.

Alongside
 another picture of her and a friend, she later tweeted: 'My brothers 
getting married! Going to the chapel with my hot bitch date 
@Barret_Swatek! We clean up okay.'

Much later, Meghan - who certainly 
appeared to have enjoyed herself at the wedding - tweeted another 
picture of her either dancing or falling over with a glass of wine in 
her hand, with the words: 'My brother got married last night, I didn't.'

Not wanting to be outdone by his eldest daughter, web-savvy John McCain also tweeted during the day.

'Wonderful
 day at my son Jack's wedding!' the Arizona senator tweeted with an 
Instagram photo of his family in the courtyard of the venue.

He later tweeted a picture of himself toasting the happy couple.

Jack is a helicopter pilot for the US Navy and is stationed in Guam, where he met Renee, an air force reservist.

Sen.
 McCain, 76, who lost to Barack Obama in a race for the Oval Office in 
2008 and to George W Bush in 2000, has been married to his wife, Cindy 
Lou Hensley McCain, since 1980.

The senator met Cindy in April 1979, while he was still married to his first wife, Carol.

He and Cindy began dating and eventually married in May 1980, only a month after his divorce to Carol was finalized.

Mrs McCain is the heiress to her father's stake in Hensley & Co, an Anheuser-Busch beer wholesaler. Her estimated net worth exceeds $100 million.

The couple signed a prenuptial agreement
 to separate their finances, but over the years, Mrs McCain has poured a significant amount of her wealth into her husband's political campaigns.

Four years after they were married, 
McCain and his wife had their first child together, Meghan, which 
was followed two years later by John (Jack) Sidney IV. In 1988, their 
third child, James, was born.

Then three years later, in 1991, the McCain family added another daughter through adoption.

Mrs McCain brought the child to the U.S. from a Bangladesh orphanage when she was just three months old because she needed medical treatment. The McCains later decided to adopt her and named her Bridget.

Bridget's skin color was targeted during McCain's 2000 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

'A lot of phone calls were made by people who said we should be very ashamed about her, about the color of her skin,' McCain said in a 2000 interview with DadMag.com. 'Thousands and thousands of calls from people to voters saying "You know the McCains have a black baby." I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those.'
