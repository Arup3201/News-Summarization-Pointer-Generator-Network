A Czech woman who gave birth on the bus on her way to work and left the newborn boy on the street to freeze to death has been sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Katerina Vastikova, 33, was travelling to her job in a factory in Trinec, a town in the north-eastern Czech Republic, when she went into labour in March.

She told police: 'I had pains and spasms on the bus. I realised that I was giving birth to my child, I felt it coming out of me. 

'It didn't take long and I left the boy in my trousers until we got to my bus stop.'

Heartless: Katerina Vastikova has been jailed for 15 years after giving birth on a bus in the Czech Republic and dumping her baby in a car park where it froze to death while she callously went off to work

Nobody on the bus noticed that she had just given birth. Miss Vastikova said that she 'left the bus and didn't know what to do'.

She added: 'I put the naked baby on the grass and tore off the umbilical cord. I don't remember if the baby was crying or breathing. Then I went to work.'

The temperature outside was around freezing and police said that the newborn died from hypothermia shortly after his birth.

Heartless Vastikova said she had then flushed the placenta down the toilet at work. She added: 'I didn't feel well. I was sick but I worked.'

The dead baby was found by a passer-by and Vastikova was arrested four days later.

Vastikova even kept her pregnancy secret from her mother and the baby's father, Robert Conka (above), who is now demanding compensation of £280,000 for the death of his son

Vastikova has two other children who are being raised by foster parents.

In court, she refused to explain why she had abandoned her baby, only saying: 'I don't know why I left him there.'

Ostrava Regional court sentenced her to 15 years in prison for murder. 

Prosecutor Vit Legersky, 39, said: 'She was hiding her pregnancy, she didn't visit her doctor and she wasn't preparing for the baby.'

Vastikova kept her pregnancy secret from both her mother and the baby's father, Robert Conka.

Conka, 34, said: 'If she had told me I would have taken care of my son. She killed my first baby. 

'I'm asking for compensation of 10 million Czech Koruna (£282,000).'
