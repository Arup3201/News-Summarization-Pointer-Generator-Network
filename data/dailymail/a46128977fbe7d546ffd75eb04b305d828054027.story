A Falklands veteran killed himself by crashing a plane into a cliff-face as he struggled with leaving the Royal Navy and splitting from his wife.

Retired Royal Navy lieutenant commander Andrew Stillwell-Cox, 55, hired a light aircraft from his flying club for a solo flight, an inquest heard.

As two friends waited for him at the airfield, he turned off-course and deliberately crashed, dying instantly.

An inquest heard that Mr Stillwell-Cox took his own life after he struggled with leaving the Royal Navy

He nosedived on to beauty spot Sheep Rock just north of RAF Portreath, Cornwall, on July 21 last year.

Horrified onlookers saw him circling at an altitude of around 500ft before his blue Cessna C172 M slammed into the ground and exploded on impact.

An inquest heard Mr Stillwell-Cox, who was twice awarded the Sword of Honour, had struggled to cope after retiring as first lieutenant from RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall in 2007.

A letter left on the dashboard of his friend and flying partner’s car described his difficulties at coming to terms with life as a civilian and a recent split from his second wife Ellie.

He also left his car and house keys and police found a note addressed to his estranged wife at his home in Retallick Meadows, St Austell.

The Truro inquest heard how Mr Stillwell-Cox had made one previous attempt to take his life a few weeks earlier by trying to gas himself in his car.

He was taken to A&E but his risk of potential suicide was recorded as low.

Mr Stillwell-Cox, who had two adults sons, met his second wife while working at RNAS Culdrose in 2004. The couple moved in together in 2006.

She told the inquest in a statement: 'Andrew lived for the Navy and found it difficult to live in civilian life. Flying was his distraction and his way of living without the Navy.

'I loved Andrew a lot and was happy in our marriage. He was very generous but found it difficult to show affection.

'When I found out I wasn’t entirely surprised as he had told me people couldn’t watch him 24/7 and couldn’t bear not being in the navy.

'Andrew died doing something he loved.'

The inquest heard that he left a letter to close friend David Spencer Evans who was at the airfield.

It read: 'Ellie has systematically destroyed me and has brought me to my knees. I know that I’m unable to continue my journey alone.

'I dread another day without Ellie by my side. I loved Ellie with all my heart.'

The letter found addressed to Ellie at his home ended: 'Please think kindly of me and remind yourself that you did once love me.'

Cornwall Coroner Emma Carlyon heard that Andrew had suffered post-traumatic and depression following his retirement.

He received counselling after a traumatic experience while serving in the Falklands where he saw a number of his friends die in front of him.

Mr Spencer Evans said: 'It was a tremendous amount to deal with. Andrew put on a brave face.

'He was greatly respected and very much admired, that’s the man he was.

'Everything he did, he did it meticulously.'

He added: 'I have no doubt at all that Andrew had not intended to come back.'

Andrew took off on his final flight without his flying suit or lucky gloves which David said he found strange.

Police later said this was significant as the gloves and suit are flame retardant,

The inquest jury returned a verdict that Mr Stillwell-Cox took his own life.

Outside the inquest his tearful second wife said: 'He was just a wonderful man.'
