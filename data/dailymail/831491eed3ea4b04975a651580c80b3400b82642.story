When the owner of this English Bulldog suggested changing its name, the dog was fine with being called Mary or even Phyllis. 

But whatever you do, don't call this dog Butkus. 

Footage of Elizabeth Hazen, from Elkhart, Indiana, suggesting names to her pet called Ellie-May has been uploaded on YouTube and has become an internet hit.

What did you call me? Ellie-May does not like it when her owner calls her Butkus

The video, posted this week, has been viewed more than 71,800 times. 

'Ellie we want to change your name', Ms Hazen says to her dog.

'Can we change it to Sarah? How about Mary? How about Phyllis? But how about Butkus?'

You wouldn't expect a canine to react so badly to being called Butkus but Ellie-May does not like it one bit growling back at her owner.

In the film Rocky starring Sylvester Stallone, Rocky Balboa's dog is also called Butkus.

Rocky's dog was played by Stallone's bullmastiff, who had the same name.

Not happy: Ellie-May walks away from her owner when she is called Butkus
