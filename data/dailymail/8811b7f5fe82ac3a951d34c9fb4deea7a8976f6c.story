Tourists visiting Britain spend a third more if they include a pub on their trip, new figures reveal.

A new global campaign will seek to cash in on the love of everything from old-fashioned boozers to cool gastro-pubs.

Some 14million people, almost half of people travelling to the UK, spend time in a pub while they are here.

Cheers: Britain's pubs could be key to a new boom in visitors after tourism bosses launched this campaign

Tourism agency VisitBritain has launched a new campaign promoting pubs around the world.

According to official data pub fans spend £676 during a holiday in Britain compared to £502 for those who avoid supping a pint.

One in 10 people who visit the UK for just a day make sure they include a pub on their whistle-stop trip.

Three-quarters of all visitors from Australians and New Zealand buy a round, compared to two-thirds of tourists from Canada, America, Sweden, Iceland and Ireland.

Four in 10 overseas visitors they get ‘warm and tingly vibes’ from visiting a pub.

Almost all of them say they would recommend Britain for a holiday as a result.

VisitBritain’s Patricia Yates said: ‘Our pubs are seen as one of the most positive experiences for people visiting Britain - and for good reason.

‘They are known for their wonderful mix of local characters, the fun and welcoming atmosphere that makes families feel welcome, the interesting history associated with so many establishments, pleasant beer gardens to enjoy the summer sunshine, the enormous selection of unusually named ales.

'And now visitors can also enjoy a tipple of award winning home-grown sparkling wine.’

The idea of pubs offering little more than a bag of crisps and pork scratchings is also long gone.

According to the government every pub contributes £100,000 to its local economy every year.

Pubs minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘The Great British pub is recognised around the world as a quintessential part of British culture. In Britain we have known for hundreds of years just how valuable our locals are.

‘Not just a place for grabbing a pint but also to the economies and communities of those they serve.’
