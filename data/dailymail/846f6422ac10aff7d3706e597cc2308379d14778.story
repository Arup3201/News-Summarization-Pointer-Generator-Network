Booed: Jeremy Hunt was not the crowd's favourite at the Paralympic Games

New Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt became the third cabinet member to be booed by the Paralympic crowd today.

The former Secretary for Culture, Media and Sport was met with loud jeers when he presented Britain’s Rachel Morris with a bronze in the women’s cycling road race.

Earlier this week, Chancellor George Osborne and Home Secretary Theresa May were greeted in the same manner when presenting medals to Paralympic winners.

Mr Hunt, who was promoted to his new role in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle, seemed unfazed by hostile reception and smiled when he handed out the medals at the Brands Hatch track in Longfield, Kent.

Medallist Rachel Morris and fellow Brit Karen Darke had earlier tried to cross the finishing line by holding hands, ensuring they each received a bronze medal at Brands Hatch.

But officials refused to oblige, and it was Morris alone who collected the bronze from Mr Hunt.

One onlooker said: ‘Hunt arrived to present the bronze medal to the British athlete and the crowd started booing him.'

‘The medal ceremony itself was on the track, and there were a lot of people there to watch it. But Hunt just seemed to get on with it.’

The Health Secretary can seek solace in not being alone to incur the wrath of the Paralympic crowd.

On Wednesday Theresa May was met with loud booing as she presented the medals for the men’s T20 1500m, won by Peyman Bazanjan of Iran.

Two days earlier, Chancellor Osborne was also given a hostile reception at the men’s T38 400m medal ceremony.

Mr
Osborne initially laughed as the jeering at the 80,000-seater Olympic 
Stadium erupted, but seemed to become embarrassed as it continued.

It
appeared spectators at the London 2012 Games were determined to deliver
their verdict on the coalition Government with the Prime Minister also 
meeting a less-than-enthusiastic reception.

While David Cameron presented Ellie Simmonds with her gold medal for the SM6 200m individual medley, some members of the crowd booed the Prime Minister but they were drowned out by cheers for the Paralympic poster girl.

It prompted Lord Coe to defend the move to invite politicians to present medals, saying they should expect to become ‘pantomime villains’.

He said: ‘There are 500 medal ceremonies, we require over 1,000 people, not just politicians, and from time to time, I know from my own personal experience, you do become the pantomime villain in politics.

‘I don’t think that we should read too much into that and I think it’s really important that politicians have been seen supporting the two greatest sporting events in our lifetimes.

‘Politicians are bold enough and brave enough to know that sometimes that is the landscape that they are in.’
