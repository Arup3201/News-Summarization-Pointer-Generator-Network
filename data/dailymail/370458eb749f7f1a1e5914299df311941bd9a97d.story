An elderly woman has died after a car without a driver rolled down a hill and knocked her over - before the owner retrieved the vehicle and accidentally ran over her again.

Lee Sheila Mahoney, 73, was walking outside her home in Edgewater, Maryland on Monday afternoon when a car that did not have its parking brake secured drifted towards her.

The 2010 Ford Mustang struck Mahoney and came to a stop on top of her, the Anne Arundel County Police Department said in a press release.

The owner of the car, 23-year-old David Adam Garman, was in a nearby home when he saw the car rolling down the street, which has a gentle incline.

Tragic loss: Lee Mahoney, pictured, was walking 
along her Edgewater, Maryland street when she was knocked over and 
killed by a driverless car on Monday. The owner then accidentally backed
 over her

Garman reached the car, climbed inside and began to reverse - unaware that Mahoney was underneath, police said.

Emergency services arrived on the scene and rushed Mahoney to Anne Arundel Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.

Public records indicate Mrs Mahoney was married with children and that the couple had lived in the same house on the street for nearly 40 years.

On Facebook, one family friend said the Mahoneys were in their prayers.

'I
 think Ms. Lee helped raise almost every kid on this street and then 
some,' Heather Price LoBianco wrote. 'She will be missed by so many 
people.'

Error: The car's owner, David Adam Garman (believed to be pictured right) saw the car rolling and ran to it

Scene: The street, where Mrs Mahoney has lived (in the house left) for nearly 40 years, is on a slight incline so when the car was not properly secured, it began rolling towards her

One relative said: 'She was the heart and soul of our family', while her sister Elaine Ritchey, added: 'God I just want to pick up the phone and call her and better yet, tell her again how much I love her.'

Police said the preliminary cause of the crash is driver error.

'The driver failed park the vehicle with its wheels turned properly towards the curb with the parking brake set,' Anne Arundel County Police spokesman Justin Mulcahy said.

It is unclear if Garman could face charges.

Authorities said the investigation is ongoing and being conducted by members of the Traffic Safety Section. Investigators will also be consulting with the State's Attorney's Office.
