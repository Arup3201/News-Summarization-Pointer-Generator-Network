Chris Hughton is confident he can stabilise Brighton before sending the Seagulls soaring towards the top end of the Sky Bet Championship.

Hughton has returned to management at the AMEX Stadium, eight months after he was sacked by Norwich.

The 56-year-old has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal to succeed Sami Hyypia, who has left him a squad firmly embroiled in a relegation battle. 

Chris Hughton has been named as the new manager of Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion

 Hughton has joined the south coast club on a three-and-a-half year contract

Chris Hughton becomes the fifth black manager across the 92 clubs in the professional football leagues, joining:

1. Fabio Liverani, Leyton Orient

2. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Burton Albion

3. Chris Powell, Huddersfield Town

4. Keith Curle, Carlisle United

Brighton are out of the drop zone on goal difference, after taking four useful points from two games under caretaker boss Nathan Jones.

Brighton have been play-off semi-finalists for each of the past two seasons, firstly under Gus Poyet and then Oscar Garcia.

Achieving that feat for a third straight year will almost certainly be beyond Hughton, but getting back in the play-off frame is the eventual aim for the former Tottenham, West Ham, Brentford and Republic of Ireland full-back.

'I want to get this club back challenging in the top six again,' said Hughton.

'With the infrastructure and everything that is in place here, that has to be the aim. 

Hughton was sacked as Norwich manager towards the end of last season

'But that is further down the line. If I look at our position in the league, first we have to try and get some stability in the results, move us into a more comfortable position and then progress from there.

'As soon as I knew there was an opportunity to come here it was one that very much excited me. The infrastructure and where this club wants to be in the future was an important factor. You only have to look at the brand new training facility and stadium that's here to see the club's ambition.

'Over the past few years they have fared very well in the division and been very close to realising their ambitions in the last couple of seasons. For whatever reason this season has not gone so well, but one of the key factors in me deciding to join the club was the ambition and the calibre of staff here already.

'The initial challenge is obvious, we need to improve our league position. But we are working to get this club back challenging at the top end of the division.

'Hopefully that won't take too long as I know the squad quite well and I have come across some of the players over the previous few seasons. I'm also familiar with the structure and some of the staff here at the club, so I hope that it is not going to take me too long to settle in.'

Hughton thanked Jones for the job he did on an interim basis for the past couple of games - a 2-2 home draw with Reading and a 2-0 victory at Fulham - and confirmed that he will remain part of his staff.

'Nathan Jones will very much be part of my first-team coaching staff and he has done a fantastic job here,' said Hughton.

'I'm particularly grateful for the last two results and as somebody from the outside with a keen interest looking in, I was hoping that the last two results would fare well and he has done very well.

'I have a lot of respect for him as an individual and also as a coach, so I'm delighted to have him on board.'

Brighton's first match following Hughton's appointment sees them travel to Brentford in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.
