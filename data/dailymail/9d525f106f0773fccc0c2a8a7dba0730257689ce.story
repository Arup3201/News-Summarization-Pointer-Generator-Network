A soldier who recently returned home from Afghanistan has given his family a heartwarming holiday surprise by jumping out of a gift-wrapped box.

Patrick Conwell, 31, enlisted the help of his brother Matthew, who told their mother, father and sister that he and his expectant wife would be hosting a party to reveal the gender of their baby - and that the giant box next to their Christmas tree contained either a pink or blue balloon that would signify whether they were having a boy or girl.

Instead, Patrick, who had been in Afghanistan for the past nine months before returning home to Nashville, Tennessee, was waiting in the package, clad in fatigues and bearing a green balloon.

Thinking outside the box: Patrick Conwell, 31, surprised his family when he returned to Nashville from Afghanistan by hiding in a gift-wrapped package

In a YouTube video that he posted Tuesday, Patrick's siblings ask their mother to guess the baby's gender.

'I don't want to say what I think it's going to be,' she says, eventually predicting that it will be a girl.

'Whatever it is, we're going to be thrilled,' she adds.

Surprise: Finally, Matthew jumped out of the box himself, bearing a green balloon

Finally, Matthew opens the brightly wrapped package and the green balloon floats out of it right before Patrick pops out.

His mother jumps back in shock and shrieks and laughs as she runs to embrace her son.

Patrick told MailOnline: 'I was talking to my brothers about returning home and the plan just kind of developed from there.

'It wasn't something that was purposefully planned; it sort of started as a joke, something that would just be funny to do. Then as we got closer to coming home, we ended up going ahead with the plan.'

Warm embrace: Patrick and his mother shared a big hug after he made his grand entrance

To keep their mother in the dark, Patrick had simply told her: 'I'm not sure if I'll be back before Christmas.' 

After the surprise, the family learned that Patrick's sister-in-law was indeed having a girl, and celebrated his homecoming by going out to eat. 

A commenter on Reddit, where Patrick posted the video Tuesday, asked whether he was sure that his parents were unaware of his plan.

'Pretty sure,' he replied. 'My dad said he "suspected something", but I'm 99per cent sure my mom and sister didn't know.'
