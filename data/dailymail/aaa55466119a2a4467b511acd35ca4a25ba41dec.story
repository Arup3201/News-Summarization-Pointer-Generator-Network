A group of 49 Turkish hostages who were seized by Islamic State militants in Iraq have been freed, the country's Prime Minister has announced.

Ahmet Davutoglu said the captives, including diplomatic staff, has been released after they were seized from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul on June 11,

ISIS fighters captured the group three months when they overran the city as the terrorized parts of the country. 

He told Turkish reporters during a visit to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, that the hostages were released early on Saturday and have safely arrived in Turkey.

The politician said he was cutting his visit short to meet with the hostages in the province of Sanliurfa, near Turkey's border with Syria. 

He did not provide details on the circumstances of their release.

'I am sharing a joyful news which as a nation we have been waiting for,' Davutoglu said. 'In the early hours our citizens were handed over to us and we brought them back to our country.'

'They have crossed into Turkey and I am on my way to see them,' Davutoglu said.

The seizure of the hostages had left Turkey, a member of the NATO military alliance and a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, hamstrung in its response to the threat from Islamic State fighters over its southern borders in Iraq and Syria.

The United States is drawing up plans for military action in Syria against Islamic State fighters but Turkey had made clear it did not want to take a frontline role, partly because they feared for the fate of the hostages.

ISIS took the Iraqi cities of Mosul, in Nineveh, and Tikrit in June and has announced an Islamic Caliphate in areas it controls in Iraq and Syria. 

This week it was reported that the extremists have created its own police force in Iraq with patrol cars, uniforms and even a jail as they continue to wreak havoc across the country.

Mosul was one of the first cities captured by Islamic State militants as they terrorized Iraq. A fighter is seen waving the black ISIS flag in the middle of the street in June 

When the 49 consular employees were captured, Turkish civil servants stood outside the Foreign Ministry in the Turkish capital Ankara, condemning those inside for 'abandoning' the group
