Manchester City and Liverpool have been alerted to the possible availability of Real Madrid midfielder Isco as James Rodriguez closes in on a move to the Bernabeu.

The Monaco midfielder starred for Colombia at the World Cup and is on the verge of sealing a dream £60million move to Carlo Ancelotti's side.

But his arrival will throw the future of Isco into doubt, with Brendan Rodgers and Manuel Pellegrini both keen on a summer move for the talented playmaker.

Liverpool have money to spend after the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, while Pellegrini worked with Isco during his three-year spell in charge of Malaga.

The 22-year-old joined Real for a fee of around £25m last summer, penning a five-year deal and making 32 La Liga appearances during his first season.

But his path to regular first-team football will be blocked when Rodriguez's move is completed on Wednesday.

With Ancelotti having already signed Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich for £24m, Madrid could sell as many as three players to help fund their summer acquisitions.

The £86m arrival of Gareth Bale last 
August meant the Spanish giants sold Mesut Ozil to Arsenal to help pay 
for the signing. This summer will be no different.

Manchester United target Angel Di Maria is candidate No 1 to move on despite Ancelotti’s insistence that the Argentine should be kept at the club.

The bank-breaking purchase of Rodriguez will also speed up Real’s desire to move on Sami Khedira – possibly bringing down the £20m asking price for the former Stuttgart midfielder, who only has one year left on his contract and is wanted by Arsenal.
