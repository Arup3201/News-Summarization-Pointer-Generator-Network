Armed police stormed the tallest building in Wales yesterday ending a two-hour siege and freeing a hostage.

Officers used tasers to subdue a lone gunman who had been holding his victim in the penthouse restaurant of The Meridian Tower in Swansea, South Wales.

The drama began shortly after 4pm when the man entered the exclusive Grape & Olive restaurant carrying a handgun.

Residents were trapped inside their luxury flats in the 29-storey tower as armed police cordoned off the building and evacuated diners from the top-floor restaurant.

Paramedics wearing protective clothing and helmets were seen entering the tower around 5pm.

Police told around 60 locals who had gathered to watch the siege to ‘move out of sight of the tower’ as the police helicopter circled the upper floors.

The siege lasted for around two hours while a police negotiator entered the tower alongside armed police and talked to the gunman.

It ended when the man was tasered by members of a ‘tactical response team’ and his hostage freed. Last night, police said a man was being held.

Jason Hole, who lives in the tower, said he saw armed police and paramedics in helmets going inside around 4.15pm and was told by police to stay in his flat.

Mr Hole said: ‘We were not allowed to leave as there was a gunman upstairs. The whole marina was cordoned off. There were about 15 police cars and there was a helicopter and armed police were trying to negotiate.

‘I went downstairs to leave as I was going back to work and they told me I had to go back up the flat because there was a gunman upstairs, or someone had gone into the restaurant with a gun and they’d had to evacuate the building.’

The lockdown ended just as Spanish football team Villarreal arrived at the Marriot Hotel next door ahead of their friendly against Swansea City today at the Liberty Stadium. One police officer apparently saw the team bus stuck at a police cordon and said: ‘Welcome to Swansea.’

A spokesman for South Wales Police said: ‘We can confirm that a hostage situation on the twenty-eighth floor of the Meridian Tower in Swansea Marina has ended peacefully with no serious injuries.

‘Officers were called to the building at 4pm after a man was taken hostage inside a public area of the building, by another man who was in possession of a firearm. Specialist resources were dispatched to the scene, including the police helicopter, armed response officers, and a trained police negotiator.

‘After approximately two hours, a tactical response team discharged taser to subdue the man and detain him. A handgun has been recovered from the scene.

‘Nobody was seriously injured as a result of the incident.’
