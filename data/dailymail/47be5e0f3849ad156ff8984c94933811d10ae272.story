Those seeking peace would do well to head north up the Eastern Seaboard into Maine.

The 2012 Peace Index, produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace, named the East Coast state as the most peaceful in the country.

Louisiana ranked last out of the 50 states for the 11th consecutive year, with the metropolitan area around New Orleans named as one of the most violent, second only to Detroit.

The survey assesses the benefits of peace and the cost of violence in terms of law enforcement needed, prison facilities used, and other costs of a violent state.

Serenity now: Maine was ranked the most peaceful state in the nation by the Institute for Economics and peace

Coastal: Portland, Maine is the largest city in the state

No violence here: Vermont tied with New Hampshire as second most peaceful, proving New England to be one of the more peaceful regions in the States

Steve Killelea, the founder and CEO of the Institute, told MSNBC.com: ‘What is absolutely clear from the index is that peaceful states perform better across a range of economic, health, education, and community factors.’

He noted that those living in more peaceful states had higher educational success rates, lower poverty, and better lives in general.

The Peace Index shows some encouraging news as well – homicide rates have fallen nearly 50 per cent since the IEP began collecting data in 1991.

Mr Killelea attributed the falling numbers to a number of factors, including an ageing population, more present law enforcement, and private security monitoring. 

Other peaceful states include Vermont, which tied for second with New Hampshire. Minnesota and Utah ranked fourth and fifth, respectively.

Big Uneasy: Louisiana was ranked worst for violence, and New Orleans was named the second most violent city, next to Detroit

Peace in the world: New Orleans was the second most violent city, left; and Louisiana ranked last, right

New York state had the highest improvement in USPI score, with a 31 per cent decrease in violence.

However, Louisiana was a poor performer and even lagged behind number 49 on the list, Tennessee.

The institute took into consideration several factors that could contribute to the state’s alarming violence, including low socioeconomic standings, and little access to good health care and education.

The state also has the highest number of children born to single parent households at 42 per cent.Wyoming was bumped up the list by 20 spots, falling at number 17 from 23, according to the report, while Arizona fell into the bottom five.

However, the study notes that around 7.2million people, or around 2.38 per cent of America’s population, are under some form of correctional supervision.

Running the gamut: The Northeast was generally peaceful, as is the Midwest; the South was generally less peaceful

Peace and quiet: Maine fell well below the national average for homicides, violent crime, and incarceration, but were average on small arms

Running over: Louisiana ran way beyond the national average for homicides, and was the state with one of the greatest incarceration numbers

According to the IEP, violence and its subsequent consequences have a significant financial impact on its residents.

In Maine, violence costs the average taxpayer around $1,300 annually, but in other parts of the country, that cost skyrockets to about $3,257 every year.

The institute notes that 17 states also managed to reduce a trifecta of ills – homicide, violent crime, and incarceration rates – showing that merely putting a criminal in prison does not decrease violence.
