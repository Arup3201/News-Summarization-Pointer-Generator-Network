It’s certainly not your average scene on the roadside - and would no doubt have livened up a few morning commutes for the passing motorists.

Fifty lost Mallard ducks were given a single-file police escort along the hard shoulder of a main road, leading to a build-up of traffic in the morning.

A police motorcyclist was captured on video ushering dozens of the birds to safety as they waddled along the A3 in Milford, Surrey, on Thursday morning.

Helped along: The escort of the Mallard ducks led to a build-up of traffic in the morning last week

They were found near the Eashing Moor Copse area of woodland and the River Wey.

A Surrey Police spokesman confirmed that the force had received a call from a concerned motorist at 7:19am on Thursday and that an officer was sent to herd the birds to safety.

He added: ‘A police officer attended and found around 50 young ducks waddling down the road.

‘With the help of a local resident and some corn, the ducks were herded to safety into a nearby shed. Attempts are now being made to locate the owner of the birds.’

The A3 road is a major 67-mile route connecting London and Portsmouth via Kingston upon Thames, Guildford, Haslemere and Petersfield. Milford is a large village, south-west of Godalming.

It's not the first time police officers have lended a hand to help stranded or lost ducks on the road.

In February 2011, U.S. police officer Glenn Eppler herded a family of ducks to safety after they became stuck in the middle of a road near an overpass in Fort Myers, Florida.

One year later, police in Texas helped a family of the birds that had wandered onto a highway.

And in May this year, police officer Mark James abandoned a high-speed chase to stop his car in Portland, Oregon, and escort a duck and two ducklings to a ditch on the side of a road.
