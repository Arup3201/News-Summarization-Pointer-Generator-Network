Liverpool are sweating on the fitness of key midfielder Lucas Leiva amid fears that he could be set for a month on the sidelines.

The Brazil international only lasted 15 minutes of Saturday's 0-0 draw with Everton after damaging his thigh and he will undergo a scan on Monday to discover the full extent of the problem.

Lucas was absent for the 2-1 win over Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup with an abductor problem but this is a different, more serious issue and is almost certain to keep him out of a sequence of key fixtures.

Starting with Tuesday night's Barclays Premier League clash with Tottenham, Liverpool have an FA Cup fifth-round tie at Crystal Palace, two Europa League games with Besiktas and a trip to Southampton on their schedule in February and how they fare in those games will have a bearing on their ambitions.

Should Lucas be absent for all those matches, it would be a major blow for manager Brendan Rodgers, as Liverpool's form had significantly improved since he restored the 28-year-old to the starting line-up.

Lucas had been a target for Inter Milan in the January transfer window but Rodgers made it clear that he wanted to keep him and it has not gone unnoticed that the only Premier League defeat they have suffered in the last two months - at Manchester United on December 14 - came when Lucas was not in the team.

There is a concern, though, that Liverpool will have to do without Lucas for a sustained period.

This is not the first time Lucas has had a thigh injury ruin his progress: during Rodgers' second Premier League game in charge of Liverpool against Manchester City in August 2012, he ruptured his quad muscle and ended up being sidelined for three months. Both player and manager - who is giving a scheduled press conference on Monday afternoon - will be desperate to avoid a similar lay-off.

Injuries are starting to have an impact on Rodgers' plans. He hopes Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho will be fit to face Tottenham after they picked up knocks against Everton, while Adam Lallana is also battling to be fit after missing the trip to Goodison Park.

'The only downfall of being in cup competitions is the number of games,' Rodgers said after the 0-0 draw. 'But whatever happens with injuries to players the squad will be better for the experience.

'If we are playing one game a week we are not in cup competitions and not doing as well as we would want. We want the games to come, this is a challenging year, but we will be better when we come out of this year and so will the players.

'Phil Coutinho had a knock on his knee and Raheem had a knock on his foot. We had fresh players on the bench to bring on and hopefully they will be fit for Tuesday.'
