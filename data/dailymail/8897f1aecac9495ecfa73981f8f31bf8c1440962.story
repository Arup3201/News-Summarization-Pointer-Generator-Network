Five days is a long time when you’re talking about the weather.

Just look at these pictures of Hawes in North Yorkshire to see how glorious green replaced last Tuesday’s snowy whiteout.

And now, after the warmest weekend for months, we’re going to be hit by a week of high winds and heavy rain.

But another warm blast is just round the corner and this time it will be here to stay.

The UK experienced the hottest day of the year on Saturday, with Santon Downham in Suffolk reaching 63F (17C), hotter than Barcelona and Rome.

Meanwhile the highest temperature yesterday was the 15.4C (59.7F) observed in Charsfield, Suffolk, while London saw a decent 13C (55.4F).

Yesterday, however, a storm system moved in from the Atlantic, bringing with it a series of weather warnings. 

The wettest place in the country yesterday was Achnagart in the Scottish Highlands, which had 1.17in (29.6mm) of rain - mostly in the early morning. 

This week we can expect frosty mornings, severe gales and prolonged rain.

Met Office forecaster Chris Page said: ‘It will bring strong winds, especially in the North. 

'There is the potential for some heavy rain and the chance of some snow too in Scotland. The whole country will experience wet and windy conditions.’ 

High winds: A yellow ‘be aware’ severe weather warning has been put in place from 9am today until 9am tomorrow over all of Scotland

On the way: Storm clouds over Tynemouth, although western and central parts of Scotland are also expected to see the heaviest downpours

Dark skies: Isaac Hughes, four, passes one the Kelpies 100ft high horse-head sculptures at the Forth and Clyde Canal in Falkirk yesterday

There will be a brief respite on Tuesday when the sun returns, but then the miserable weather will continue until Thursday.

From next weekend, however, a spell of high-pressure will take hold across the country.

In a three-month contingency forecast for March to May, the Met Office said that above-average temperatures and dry weather are likely.

But it did add that the forecasts are only broad predictions. 

The previous record for this year was set two months ago in Exeter, Devon, when temperatures reached 16.5C (63.5F) on January 9.

But the sun was not enjoyed by all - with western parts of Scotland experiencing wet weather - and the warm conditions are not expected to last.  

Happy: Claude, a three-week old Valais Blacknose lamb, with four-year-old Evie Duncan and her brother Bertie, two, at Whitehall Farm in Dumfries, south-west Scotland. The rare lamb had its leg broken at birth, but is now being nursed back to health and has the limb in a cast

A yellow ‘be aware’ severe weather warning for wind has been put in place from 9am today until 9am tomorrow over the whole of Scotland.

The alert - which also covers the far north of Northern Ireland – advised that gusts could hit 80mph in exposed parts of western and northern Scotland.

Western and central parts of Scotland are also expected to see heavy downpours, with up to 7.87in (200mm) of rain forecast over 36 hours.

The worst-hit area on Saturday was Cluanie Inn in the Scottish Highlands, which suffered 4.37in (111mm) from midday Friday to midday Saturday.

Elsewhere in the Highlands, the rain affected football - with a waterlogged pitch postponing Inverness Caledonian Thistle's match with Raith Rovers.

The Scottish Cup quarter-final tie at the Caledonian Stadium was put off on Saturday due to ‘incessant rain throughout the night’, the club said. 

On the south coast: Clouds over Eastbourne Pier in East Sussex on Sunday, as the warm weather is set to give way to high winds and rain

Saturday in Brighton: The country basked in hotter weather than Barcelona, Rome and Athens, with temperatures hitting a high of 17.5C

Meanwhile there was an Environment Agency flood alert in place yesterday for the North Sea coast at Bridlington in East Yorkshire.

But in the South on Saturday with spring finally appearing to have sprung, thousands headed outdoors to enjoy the warmth.

Sun-seekers flocked to Hampton Court Palace in south-west London and the sandy beach at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk.

In central London, swarms of bees feasted on nectar and pollen in St James's Park, where temperatures rose as high as 16.7C (62.1F).

Speaking of the week ahead, forecaster Craig Snell said: ‘Temperatures will return to around average, with highs of 10C (50F) to 11C (52F).'

He added that this was 'still not cold', but stated: 'Next week will see quite changeable weather but nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year.’
