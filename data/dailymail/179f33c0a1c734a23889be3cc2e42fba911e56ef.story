Residents of Lismore have lashed out at their local council after they erected a less than spectacular Christmas tree on the middle of a roundabout.

Standing on the corner of Woodlark St and Keen St is what locals have dubbed the Leaning Tree of Lismore.

The lopsided tree, which is stripped of its branches on the lower half and adorned with crude decorations, was decorated by Lismore council workers last week.

Locals were quick to attack the tree on social media.

Colin Small wrote: Looks like workers forgot cherry picker and threw them up and hope they stayed.

One Facebook page, 'Lismore needs a new Christmas tree', was launched specifically to lambaste the tree.  

Lismore Radio attacked the questionable location.

'Very difficult to do a street party here. The tree is on a roundabout at the busiest CBD intersection on an RTA road,' they said.  

Meanwhile, Mayor Jenny Dowell told Daily Telegraph:  'It's a bit Bent - like Lismore itself'

Lismore City Council parks co-ordinator Martin Soutar told Northern Star the lopsided tree was chosen on purpose.

'The tree is a Cook pine Araucaria columnaris and they all actually have a slightly natural screw or 's' shape, so they naturally tend to lean,' he said.

'It is likely a lot of effort was put into selecting this species, as it would grow tall but it would not spread, which was important due to the power lines it grows within,' 

Lismore City Council reportedly has a $15,000 yearly budget for Christmas decorations, while many comparable outer suburban metropolitan councils in  have budgets 10 times that amount.
