Andy Carroll took to a spot of crowd surfing on Tuesday evening when his West Ham side faced Everton in their FA Cup third round replay against Everton at Upton Park.

As Enner Valencia went through on goal in the opening minutes, the Ecuadorian's effort was brilliantly saved by the onrushing Toffees goalkeeper Joel Robles.

Quick to pounce on the loose ball was Carroll, who headed against the post from the tightest of angles as the ball looked to be going out of play.

Unable to stop himself, the Hammers striker's momentum sent him bounding into the away supporters in the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand.

Unsurprisingly, the 26-year-old took some banter from the Everton fans before their good nature kicked in and they helped him to his feet.

Not so sure the same fans would have done the same when he was plying his trade at Anfield.
