Didier Drogba looked particularly surprised to see Chelsea striker Diego Costa back in training after the £32million signing's injury lay-off.

The 36-year-old has been deputising for Costa, who spent one night in hospital after a virus hampered his recovery from hamstring and groin injuries, with Loic Remy also sidelined.

Costa has been absent from Chelsea's squad since representing Spain against Slovakia and Luxembourg earlier this month, which led Jose Mourinho to blame manager Vicente del Bosque.

But the Chelsea squad looked giddy enough to have their main striker back ahead of the visit of Queens Park Rangers to Stamford Bridge on Saturday, and even tried their hand at basketball.

Chelsea sit top of the Premier League after an unbeaten start to the season, and have a six-point advantage over reigning champions Manchester City.

Costa's last Chelsea game saw the 26-year-old seal a 2-0 win against London rivals Arsenal, and the former Atletico Madrid striker will be hungry to add to his nine-goal tally so far. 

Mourinho's day may only be spoiled by the news that Spain manager Del Bosque insisted he will remain 'stubborn' over the selection of Costa.

Mourinho blamed Costa's inclusion in Spain's Euro 2016 qualifiers earlier in October for his lay-off, but Del Bosque says he will not leave the striker out just to satisfy the Chelsea boss. 

'In some things we are very flexible and in others stubborn, and in this we are stubborn,' says Del Bosque.

'I don't know if we are right or wrong, but if we hadn't called up Costa for the national team we'd definitely have been criticised for not having done so.'
