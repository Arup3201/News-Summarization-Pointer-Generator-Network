Clubbers are being warned of the risk of overdosing on 'super strength' ecstasy, as tests reveal the drug's purity is at its highest level for ten years.

Tests carried out on drugs which were seized during the summer show a huge rise in the amount of MDMA contained in the party drug.

In one case, the government warned one batch had been tested to have about two-and-a-half times the standard MDMA dose - the active ingredient in ecstasy - per pill.

It comes after the number of deaths caused by ecstasy soared from eight in 2010 up to 43 in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The perceived rise in purity has prompted the Warehouse Project in Manchester (WHP), one of the biggest clubs in the country, to warn revellers about the dangers of increased purity before they visit the venue.

Sacha Lord, director of WHP, said the concern was that those who are used to taking two or three tablets of a lower purity will continue to do so, potentially sparking fatal consequences. 

While the club says it does not condone drug-taking, it has started warning about 'very high purity' drugs in circulation on its Twitter feed.

Mr Lord told the Guardian: 'I would much rather warn people that the quality is that high and that it could cause all these issues if you take too much.'

Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at Durham University, who regularly tests drugs, says the average ecstasy tablet now contains 100mg of MDMA.

In 2009 the average ecstasy pill contained just 20-30mg.

An 'acceptable' dose for an average-sized adult during one drug-taking session is 70-75mg, she says.

Ms Measham said the increased purity of ecstasy was probably due to manufacturers developing new ways to synthesise the drug. 

Last year, WHP started warning customers of the dangers of PMA, a potentially lethal drug often sold under the banner of MDMA. 

Though no clubbers have been taken to hospital since the start of the season in September, about four of the 2,000 punters who attend each night end up being treated by on-site paramedics, mostly for drug-related issues. 

In an inquest earlier this month, the court heard how Prince's Trust worker Nick Bonnie, 30, died from ecstasy and cocaine poisoning.

He unknowingly took almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before entering the club, the coroner ruled.

Tests showed a concentration of 4.42mg of MDMA in his blood. Typical recreational use normally measuring just 0.3mg.

Anne-Marie Cockburn has called for a change to UK drug policy, after her daughter Martha Fernback died from taking a ecstasy tablet which was 91 per cent pure. The average is around 58 per cent

Earlier this year, Anne-Marie Cockburn, the mother of 15-year-old Martha Fernback, who died in 2013, called for drugs to be legalised.

Martha, from Oxford, had consumed a dose which was 91 per cent pure. The average street purity is 58 per cent. 

Speaking after the inquest into her daughter's death, Miss Cockburn said: 'We need strict and responsible regulation.

'I'm not a radical person, this has been well considered and thought out. If we had that, Martha would have been able to make an informed decision.

'Martha wanted to get high, she didn't want to die - no parent wants either, but one of those is preferable to the other.' 

Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest at County Hall in Oxford.

He said: 'It is a terrible loss and I think we can only say that it may at least serve as a warning to young people who may take, or think of taking, ecstasy or MDMA.

'What is clear is that there is no way of knowing what it is made up of or what the purity level is. So, as I say, this is a very stark warning of what can happen.'
