An Ohio man will spend at least 36 years in prison for the fatal shooting of a man who identified his murderer by blinking his eyes while paralyzed and hooked up to a ventilator.

Ricardo Woods, 35, was convicted last month of murder and felonious assault charges after jurors were shown footage of an interview in which victim David Chandler blinked his eyes three times to identify Woods as his assailant.

Woods was sentenced to 36 years to life in prison yesterday for shooting Chandler, 35, in the head and neck as he was sitting in a car in Cincinnati in October 2010.

Chandler died a fortnight after the police interview.

The defense had tried to block the video, saying Chandler's blinks were inconsistent and unreliable.Woods, who insists he is innocent, stood stoically before a Hamilton County judge on Thursday and showed no visible emotion as she sentenced him. Judge Beth Myers said the sentence she gave him was 'necessary to protect the public and punish Mr. Woods'.Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 37 years to life, the maximum, while the defense had asked the judge for the minimum, 18 years to life.Assistant county Prosecutor David Prem told the judge prior to sentencing that Woods' previous criminal history, including prison terms for attempting to kill someone and drug trafficking, should be taken into account.'He is a dangerous and violent offender,' Prem said, adding that it was time for the Chandler family and the state of Ohio to get justice.Defense attorney Kory Jackson told the judge that Woods has 'always maintained that he is not guilty and still maintains that today'.Woods nodded yes when the judge said she understood that he planned to appeal.

During the case prosecutors showed jurors a videotaped police interview in which they
say Chandler blinked three times for 'yes' to identify a photo of Woods
as his shooter. The defense had tried to block the video, saying 
Chandler's blinks were inconsistent and unreliable.

Woods' attorney, Kory Jackson, said Chandler's condition and drugs 
used to treat him could have affected his ability to understand and 
respond during the police interview.

Judge Beth Myers had watched the video and said that she found the 
identification reliable. She noted that Chandler's identification was 
made by pronounced, exaggerated movement of the eyes and not by 
involuntary movements.

A doctor who treated Chandler also testified that
Chandler was able to communicate clearly about his condition.

In the video, police had to repeat some questions when Chandler 
failed to respond or when the number of times he blinked appeared 
unclear.

But Chandler blinked his eyes hard three times when police 
asked him if the photo of Woods was the photo of his shooter. He again 
blinked three times when they asked him if he was sure.

A jailhouse informant testified that Woods told him he shot at 
Chandler because he caught him buying drugs from someone else while 
still owing Woods money for drugs.

The defense argued that the informant, who faced armed robbery 
charges, was trying to use testimony against Woods to get a lighter 
sentence for himself. The defense also said Chandler had stolen drugs 
from dealers, was considered a police "snitch" and had many enemies.

The defense insisted that Woods was a victim of misidentification and misinformation.

Legal experts say such cases — where prosecutors attempt to show a 
defendant was identified by a gesture — are not unheard of but are 
unusual. Dying identifications relying on gestures rather than words are
often not used in trials because of concern over reliability or 
differing interpretations. But some have been used in murder cases 
around the country that have ended in convictions.

Captivated jurors in a Cincinnati 
murder trial watched video Tuesday that prosecutors say shows a dying, 
paralyzed shooting victim who couldn't speak identifying a photo of his 
killer by blinking his eyes.

Over the unsuccessful and repeated 
objections of defense attorneys, prosecutors showed the jury a 17-minute
video of shooting victim David Chandler, 35, in which he answers 
detectives' questions by blinking twice to say ‘no’ and three times for 
‘yes.’

Ricardo Woods, 35, is charged with Chandler's October 2010 murder and has pleaded not guilty.
