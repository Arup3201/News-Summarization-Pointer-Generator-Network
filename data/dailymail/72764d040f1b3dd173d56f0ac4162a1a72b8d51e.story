Attorneys for the 
suspect in the Colorado movie theater shootings said today that their 
client is mentally ill and that they need more time to assess the nature
of his illness.

James Holmes' lawyers made 
the disclosure at a court hearing in suburban Denver where news media 
organizations asked a judge to unseal documents in the case.

Holmes,
a 24-year-old former Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, 
Denver, had the same dazed demeanor that he had in previous court 
appearances.

Holmes is accused of going on a 
July 20 shooting rampage at a midnight showing of the latest Batman 
movie in Aurora, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others.

Attorney Daniel King made the revelation about Holmes' illness as he 
argued that the defense needs more information from prosecutors and 
investigators to assess their client.

'We cannot begin to assess the nature and the depth of Mr. Holmes' mental illness until we receive full disclosure,' he said.

King
said Holmes sought out university psychiatrist Lynne Fenton for help. A
hearing was scheduled for August 16 to establish whether there was a 
doctor-patient relationship between them.

There
were fewer victims and family members in the courtroom Thursday than at
earlier hearings.

Several spectators appeared mesmerized by the sight 
of Holmes, unable to take their eyes off him.

Mental
illness 'doesn't give him the right to do what he did,' Chris Townsond,
who escaped the shooting unharmed, said after the hearing. 'I don't 
care how mentally damaged he is.'

Analysts 
expect the case to be dominated by arguments over the defendant's 
sanity, and Thursday's statement by the defense was the strongest 
confirmation so far that mental illness will be a key issue.

A court document previously revealed that Holmes was seeing the psychiatrist for unknown reasons.

Holmes' public defenders could argue he is not mentally competent to stand trial.

It
was the argument used for Jared Loughner, who pleaded guilty this week 
to a 2011 shooting rampage in Arizona that killed six people and wounded
13 others, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

If
Holmes goes to trial and is convicted, his attorneys can try to stave 
off a possible death penalty by arguing he is mentally ill. Prosecutors 
will decide whether to seek the death penalty in the coming weeks.

Around 20 news organizations also asked Chief 
District Judge William Sylvester to scale back a gag order that bars the
university from releasing details about Holmes.

Sylvester
had said in issuing the order that he wanted to protect the county's 
investigation. But even Aurora officials have cited the gag order in 
declining to speak about the city's response to the shootings.

News
media attorney Steven D Zansberg said state law allows judges to issue
gag orders barring prosecutors and law enforcement from commenting, but
not agencies outside of the investigation, such as the university.

King
opposed the news media motion, saying the gag order ensures fairness. 
Prosecutor Karen Pearson said she had filed her own argument on the 
issue in court - and that it is sealed.

Sylvester
said he would rule on the matter by Monday. He did not say when he 
would respond to the news media's request to unseal the court documents.

Those
documents include the case file, which makes it impossible for 
observers to understand prosecution and defense arguments on motions 
that are referenced by number only.

Those 
types of documents can be an important source of information for the 
public and can shed light on how police say Holmes prepared for the 
shooting and rigged his apartment with explosives.

Gregory
Moore, editor of The Denver Post, said before the hearing that the news
organizations are trying to perform their watchdog role, making sure 
the investigation is being conducted openly and fairly.

In
Colorado, this type of legal battle has been seen before, including the
2003 case of Los Angeles Lakers player Kobe Bryant who faced sexual 
assault charges in Vail.

It took a news media 
challenge to unseal an affidavit in which police laid out their case for
an arrest. Bryant maintained his innocence, and prosecutors dropped the
case in 2005.
