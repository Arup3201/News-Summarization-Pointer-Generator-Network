Screen legend Sir Michael Caine has revealed his secret to keeping a razor-sharp brain – the Indian spice turmeric.

The 80-year-old double Oscar winner says a supplement containing the spice helps him ward off the effects of ageing.

And Caine is grateful to his Indian-born wife of 40 years Shakira for introducing him to its health benefits. Speaking to Hollywood chat show host  Larry King backstage after a fundraising event for Alzheimer’s research, Caine said: ‘I am married to an Indian lady and have learned about Indian culture.

‘I looked into what they got and didn’t get. And one of the things they don’t get is Alzheimer’s.

‘They eat a great deal of turmeric in their food. I have been taking turmeric tablets for 30 years and I have a memory like a computer.  I remember everything.’

Turmeric is commonly used in curries. It gives a rich yellow colour to foods.

Its active ingredient, curcumin,  is a known anti-inflammatory and is thought to have cancer-preventing properties. It has long been used in alternative medicine as a brain and health-enhancing supplement.

Caine has starred in more than 100 films including Zulu, Alfie and Educating Rita. He was knighted in 2000, turned 80 last month – and said he was ‘delighted’ to still be active and working.

However, he revealed that his memory is not completely infallible. He said: ‘I can’t remember where I put my glasses. They are on your head and your grandkids laugh at you and that is when you look like a silly old guy.’
