A family has begged for the speed limit to be cut outside their house after ten serious crashes in 18 months.

The Pinnocks from Wickford, Essex, say it is only a matter of time before somebody is killed after another head-on crash last week left two people in hospital.

They have taken pictures of almost all the accidents, including one which left a car on its roof, another smashed into a tree and one vehicle that destroyed their fence and ended up in their garden.

Dangerous: An Essex family says that somebody will soon be killed after ten crashes in 18 months outside their home, including several who smashed through their fence and into their garden

Black spot: These two cars were totalled on February 7 2014 at 6am   - which has led to calls for a cut in the speed limit from 60mph

Latest incident: Police inspect a vehicle after a crash that led to two men being taken to hospital last Tuesday

Alison Pinnock, 47, said: 'There have been 10 accidents on this stretch of road, in the past 18 months.

'A number of them have ended up with cars crashing in to our garden.

'We have written to the council a number of times about the problems here.

'We want to see the speed limit reduced from 60mph to 40mph or 30mph. People are just driving along here too quick.

Dramatic: This vehicle was left on its roof following an accident ion December 1 last year. The family living next to the crash site say it will inevitably cost lives sooner rather than later

Another fence destroyed: This lorry piles into the Pinnocks' garden near Basildon in Essex on February 13

In bad shape: This transit van was destroyed in yet another crash on December 30 last year, and the local council has now confirmed plans to improve the road

Another casualty: This smashed estate vehicle is towed away and just last week two people were treated in hospital after another crash on December 1 last year

'We are frightened it is just a matter of time before someone is killed.'

Councillors say highways engineers will be looking at changing the layout of the road as part of the redevelopment of the nearby Runwell Hospital site.

Decimated: Vehicles have regularly lost control and smashed into the family's fence. This picture was taken after a crash in February last year

Last week two people were taken to hospital, one with serious injuries, following a head-on smash on the same stretch of road.

Malcolm Buckley, Basildon Council member for regeneration said: 'There has been a proposal to for the entry to the site to be moved down the hill, from the Toby Carvery.

'We are also considering weight restrictions on Runwell Road to discourage people from using it as a cut through between the Rettendon Turnpike and Wickford.

'Changes to the speed limit would be part of the considerations by highways engineers.'

Councillor Ray Ride, who represents Runwell, said he was aware of the problems in Runwell Road and was working with councillors at Basildon and County Hall.

He said: 'It is a dangerous spot with a record of accidents all affecting the Pinnock's home.

'Within the redevelopment of the Runwell Hospital site, which is imminent, road improvements will go in.

'Those might well assist my view that there should be further protection for the Pinnock family and their neighbours.

'We are looking at what options are available.'

The Pinnocks family are urging the council to reduce the speed limit after the following 10 crashes occurred outside their property within an 18-month period.
