Tragedy: Trent Haywood, 14, died on Sunday after coming off a 30m jump during a motocross event in New Zealand

World at his feet: Trent was posthumously crowned the winner of the event thanks to points he had already accrued

Around 100 people - including Trent's father - witnessed the tragedy.

Tributes began inundating the Tauranga Boys' College student's Facebook page, with friends and family expressing their disbelief that the talented young rider had been snatched away from them so soon.

'I had the pleasure of knowing and training Trent. He trained like a Demon, and loved every second of what he did. He had a heart of gold and will be sorely missed,' wrote his former coach.

'I have never met a kid who was so happy, constantly smiling and thankful for everything. It was a privileged to have been able to train him, and see how he improved. He went out on a win, well done.'

Friend Mitchell Bond wrote: 'I can't believe this has happened bro! This is so not fair, gone way to early (sic).'

In yet another tragic twist, Trent was named champion of the event - which was cancelled following his death - thanks to points he had already accrued on the day.

A family friend of the Haywoods told the New Zealand Herald the young rider died doing what he loved.

'He has been riding since he was just a little guy, about 4 or 5,' he said.

'And he is just awesome, he loves it, motocross is his absolute passion.

'He has had a lot of success regionally and was starting to enjoy the rewards of hard work.

Talented: Trent in action doing what he loved. Friends said he died engaged in an activity he was passionate about

'This is just tragic. He was far too young but I can't help thinking he was doing what he loved and that is a lesson for all of us in life. Spend your time doing something you are passionate about.'

Police said his death was the first in the event's 35 year history.
