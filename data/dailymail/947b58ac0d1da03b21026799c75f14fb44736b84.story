A British poker champion was attacked in the early hours of this morning just hours after winning $10million in a Las Vegas tournament.

Sam Trickett, 26, was leaving a club with a female friend when six men assaulted the pair.

The former plumber, from Retford, Nottinghamshire, was left with a cut face and covered in bruises while his companion, Natasha Sandhu, was spat on. Nothing was believed to have been stolen.

The incident came just hours after Mr Trickett, whose nickname is 'Tricky', was runner-up in the Big One For One Drop poker tournament in Sin City.

He won $10.1million (£6.5million) for coming second after placing a stake of $1million (£640,000) to enter the contest, the highest entry fee in history.

Mr Trickett was out celebrating his win when he was set upon by six strangers.

He Tweeted last night: 'Was having a great day until 6 guys did this to me. Seriously WTF? Couldn't be more angry #cowards.'

He added a short while later: 'Is this what happens if you're successful?

Literally beat the s*** out of me and spit in Natasha's face all over nothing.'

Miss Sandhu shed some more light on the situation, via her own Twitter account.

She wrote: 'It wasn't a mugging or anything just over nothing. Sam is fine... gonna spend some quality time together now.'

It is not known if the pair contacted police following the assault.

The tournament was won by Iran-born Antonio Esfandiari, who took home $18.3million (£11.7million) in prize money.

But a delighted Mr Trickett, speaking before the assault, said he planned to toast his $10.1million win with a few drinks.

He wrote to his followers on Twitter: 'Thank you everyone for your support, you're all legends! Time to go drink until my organs hurt.'

He added: 'The first thing I should do now is to call my mum and dad back home in England. The second I heard about the tournament my eyes lit up, and I knew I wanted to be in it.'

Amazingly, Mr Trickett claimed he was 'angry' for not claiming the top prize due to taking a high-risk strategy during the final few hands of the tournament.

His multi-million dollar win is a long way from his humble origins at Sheffield casinos in 2005.

Two years later he won £3,500 before taking home £156,000 for finishing in fourth place at a World Series of Poker event in Las Vegas in 2008.

Forty-eight players took part in the Big One For One Drop tournament, which started last Sunday before wrapping up yesterday.
