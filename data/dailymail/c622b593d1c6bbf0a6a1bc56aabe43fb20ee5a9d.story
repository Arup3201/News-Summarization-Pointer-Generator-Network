The last time Mike Brown played a Test in Auckland it all went badly wrong for him off the field but bouncing back from that, and proving what he is made of, has been the making of England’s world-class full back.

In 2008, Brown was one of two England players found guilty of misconduct, fined and reprimanded by the RFU following a big night out after the First Test. 

The net result was that Brown lost his place and did not play again for England for four years. That’s an eternity when you are a young, ambitious, patriotic and very talented rugby player and it can make or break you. Brown was always a good player but not a great player and nobody was arguing stongly that he was a 'must' selection, including me. How times have changed.

Better player: Brown has returned to the England set-up with a bang following his four-year exile

Such experiences are normally a huge wake-up call but, if flipped around, can also be massive motivators. When you get picked for England you can start ‘living the dream’ and think it will last forever - 30 years on from my England playing career I remember that feeling only too well - but the reality is that your time at the top goes in a flash and you have to make every minute of every game count. To be left out for any reason other than ability is something that will haunt you forever. 

With England there are always players queuing up to take your place, they have so many good players in every position and if you step out of line or fall out of favour you have to ask yourself how much you really want it.  The only way back often is to become a ‘great’ player. 

Brown’s response was to redouble his efforts with Harlequins, help them to top domestic honours, become a model professional and that great player. It has been his very good fortune to have in Conor O’Shea, his boss at Quins, an outstanding individual who demands high standards while Stuart Lancaster is another rock-solid character. But it is Brown who deserves the plaudits and there is nothing better than to prove the doubters wrong.

After four years of hard graft, Brown won back his place in the England team, initially on the wing against Scotland in 2012 before reclaiming the full-back berth. Now he returns to New Zealand as one of England’s 'go-to' men. It’s a big moment in every sense. Being ‘great’ at Twickenahm is one thing, being great in New Zealand is another level altogether. 

In the spotlight: To be left out of the England team for anything other than ability will haunt a player forever

Fortress: The All Blacks are unbeaten at Auckland's Eden Park  stadium for 20 years

Brown was recently voted Premiership player of the season by his peers and the Six Nations player of the season by the public which will guarantee him being targeted – as a player and individual - by New Zealand on Saturday. He should take that as a huge compliment, although it might not feel like it as he plucks another high ball out of the air with half the All Black pack in close attendance.

New Zealand will target Brown in two ways, firstly as a player and then as an individual. They will have studied his running lines and how he always seems to break the first tackle. Brown invariably ups the tempo and intensity when he comes into the line or counter-attacks - things begin to happen - but New Zealand will also know the extra value of turning him over as often as possible.

Often in the Northern Hemisphere we put too much emphasis on a full-back’s defensive qualities. For me full-back has always been a key attacking position, made for players who can ‘make something happen’. The southern hemisphere takes that view as well. You think of the carnage Christian Cullen used to cause at full-back and how he wasn’t so effective when he was moved to centre. More recently Australia’s most potent attacking weapon is Israel Folau, New Zealand look to Israel Dagg.

You have to ask the question - who would the opposition least want running the ball back at them if they kick it away? In my time with England that was Jason Robinson and Josh Lewsey, now for England that is definitely Mike Brown. He is a huge attacking threat. Four tries in the recent Six Nations, 49 tries in 150 Premiership matches from full-back for Quins tells its own story.

Dangerman: All Blacks full back Israel Dagg is a master of attacking with the ball from full back

Unpredictable: Jason Robinson was one is one of the finest examples of an attacking full back

Brown adds tempo to the game and England need to get him involved as much as possible so one thing I would like to see him do is follow all New Zealand kicks into touch and grab them before the ball-boys, so every time he has got the option of taking a quick throw, either to himself or a supporting player. It won’t always be on but England need to know that it is always an option and pour back in support. It’s a great way of imposing the tempo you want to play at.

New Zealand will also test Brown’s character and see if he really can turn the other cheek in the heat of battle. He is a fiery, feisty character on the pitch -  Mr Angry to his team-mates -  and I like that attitude but you have to know exactly where that line is in Test rugby and avoid stepping over it. The All Blacks would love to get him involved in some verbals or a fracas of some sort because not only might it distract him it would get the whole Auckland crowd going and baying for English blood.  

The Kiwis always play better when it starts to kick off, when there is electricity in the air and the testosterone levels start rising as the clashes start getting close up and personal. They thrive off that but aren’t always so comfortable when a good side just goes quietly about its business and basically ignores them. Brown needs to rein it in and show all that great professionalism which has become the cornerstone of his game since he was last down Auckland way.
