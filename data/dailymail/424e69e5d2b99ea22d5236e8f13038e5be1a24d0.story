Standing trial: Michael Brewer, a school music director, is accused of raping an ex-pupil and Manchester Crown Court today heard another former student give evidence of 'sexual abuse'

A respected choirmaster accused of raping a pupil was  later forced to resign after almost being caught with the school’s head girl half-naked in his office, a court heard yesterday.

But the real reason for Michael Brewer’s departure from world-renowned Chetham’s School of Music was ‘kept quiet’ and instead given as health issues, a jury was told.

Now in her mid 30s, the former head girl and talented oboist said that when she was 17 Brewer used to invite her into his office at the boarding school, take off her top and bra and fondle her breasts.

She told Manchester Crown Court that Brewer – then 49 – wanted to take things further, commenting on the ‘horrid tights’ she wore with her school uniform and saying they were ‘about denying access’.

On another occasion, she said, he told her to look at a picture on his office wall, and when she turned back he had exposed himself and then mentioned a sex act.

The teacher also bought them matching watches inscribed with her initials, she said.

Brewer resigned after the headmaster knocked on the office door during one of their sex sessions and became suspicious, the trial heard.

After leaving his post as director of music at Chetham’s in the mid 1990s, Brewer went on to hold the same position with the National Youth Choirs.

He was awarded the OBE and featured in the BBC series, Last Choir Standing.

Yesterday the jury heard from the former head girl of the Manchester school about incidents that happened in the 1990s – more than 20 years after Brewer is accused of raping another pupil, encouraged by his then wife.

The witness said Brewer liked to be ‘familiar’ with pupils, but on one occasion when she was 17 he gave her a ‘sexual’ hug.

A day or two later, she told the jury: ‘He kissed me on the mouth – it was a passionate kiss. I was very surprised but I let him do it.’

From then on she would see him almost daily in his office at the school or in a practice room.

‘He started to feel my chest and my legs, and unbutton my shirt and eventually I was without a bra,’ she said. ‘We would just be talking and he would touch my breasts.’

She told the jury she felt out of her depth and tried telling Brewer she’d be going away to university soon, to which he replied: ‘The way I feel now I would wait four years for you.’

They also discussed another pupil he had had an affair with who Brewer described as ‘a bad girl who seduced me and took me to bed’.

At around the same time, she said, Brewer told her he wanted her to meet his then wife, known as Kay, which she found ‘weird’.

The court heard that one evening she was sitting on the sofa in Brewer’s office, naked from the waist up when the headmaster, Reverend Peter Hullah, knocked on the door.

Brewer ‘panicked’ and bundled her out of a side door as she threw her clothes back on. After an inquiry, Brewer admitted inappropriate behaviour and resigned. The witness said the public explanation was ‘health reasons’ and ‘it was all kept quite quiet’.

Earlier the trial heard from the alleged victim who said Brewer sexually abused her from the age of 14, then raped her, with his wife’s encouragement, when she was 18.

Brewer, 68, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies one count of rape and 13 counts of indecent assault.

Hilary Kay Brewer, 68, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and one of aiding and abetting rape.

The trial continues.
