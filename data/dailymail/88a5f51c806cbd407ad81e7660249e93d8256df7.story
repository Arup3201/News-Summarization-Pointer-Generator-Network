Bad timing: This all comes just days after Kim's sister revealed in an interview that she had given up the dog

 Rozario described the incident in detail in an interview with the New York Daily News.

'Kim was lying on the bed talking, and all of a sudden out of nowhere, the dog starts biting me,' she said.

'I'm trying to pull back, but the dog has hold of me with its teeth. I fall backwards onto floor with blood spurting everywhere. There was blood all over the place.'

Paramedics eventually came to the house to treat Rozario and take her to a local hospital, though she claims Richards asked her not to call 911 and to keep the incident 'hush-hush.' 

Rozario, who needed stitches following the attack, says she was happy to keep quiet about the attack, until she learned that Richards had no plans to get rid of the animal.

'I'm 80 years old, I'm lucky I didn't die in that room,' she said. 

'When I fell backward onto the floor, I could have bashed my head in.'

This all comes just weeks after the dog also attacked Richards' niece Alexia, the daughter of her sister Kyle.

It was during an interview about that incident in which Kyle revealed her sister had given Kingsley away.

'I really felt bad because I know she felt bad about what happened and the dog is very important to her, so I felt bad I felt terrible I was upset,' she told People.

'She did what she felt was the right thing to do.'

Viewers of the popular reality show saw Kingsley's frightening behavior in the show's fourth season, where the dog bit his trainer.
