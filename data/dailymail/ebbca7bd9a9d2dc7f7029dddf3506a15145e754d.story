A female UK military medic was continuing to receive treatment for ebola at a London hospital last night, as another British health worker was being tested for the virus.

The woman is being cared for at the Royal Free Hospital. She was flown back from Sierra Leone on Thursday.

Four military colleagues who came into contact with her were evacuated back to the UK.

Three have been discharged while one remains under observation.

In a new development, a civilian healthcare worker is being monitored at the Royal Free after being pricked by a needle while treating ebola patients.

Meanwhile, it was reported last night that at least ten people who have been exposed to the virus were being flown back to the US for observation and treatment if needed.  

She had been flown home from Sierra Leone on Thursday, alongside two other colleagues (pictured)
