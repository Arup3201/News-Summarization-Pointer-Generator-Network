Police are appealing for dozens of motorists who drove past an 18-year-girl as she was being raped at a bus stop to come forward. 

The teenage girl was waiting for a bus into Leeds City centre when the man grabbed her shortly before 11pm on Friday. 

The 18-year-old girl suffered what police are describing a serious head and hip injures after the man, who is believed to be in his 20s, pounced in the Beeston Hill area of Leeds. 

Detectives believe the girl was waiting for a bus into the city centre when the man, who is described as a slim Asian with receding dark hair, attacked.

A team of specialist forensic officers spent the day recovering evidence from the crime scene 

Officers were looking for any hair or fibres that could help them identify the suspect who is in his 20s

Police found the girl lying on the ground suffering head injuries but it later emerged she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. 

Officers said the road was very busy at the time of the attack and are appealing for any witnesses to come forward. 

The scene of the crime was secured last night and a specialist team of forensic officers have begun a finger-tipped search of the area searching for evidence. 

It is believed that dozens of motorists would have driven past the bus stop while the terrifying attack was underway. 

Detective Chief Inspector Elizabeth Belton is leading the hunt for the attacker. She said: 'We believe this woman was standing at the bus stop close to Malvern Road, when she was attacked by the suspect we are appealing for anyone in the Beeston Hill area at around 10:52 PM on Friday night who may have seen the suspect or witnessed the attack to get in touch by dialling 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.'
