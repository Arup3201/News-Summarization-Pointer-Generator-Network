Steven Gerrard has described it as the 'toughest decision of my life' after announcing he will leave Liverpool.

Outgoing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has 'been a hero to this generation' and is no less of a player because he never won a league title, according to Reds legend Kenny Dalglish.

Gerrard announced his decision to leave his boyhood club at the end of the season late on New Year's Day following their 2-2 draw at home to Leicester City.

The 34-year-old's decision ends a glittering 17-year professional career at Anfield, in which the midfielder has scored 180 goals in 695 appearances to date.

Premier League: 494 appearances, 116 goals

FA Cup: 39 appearances, 13 goals

League Cup: 28 appearances, 9 goals

Champions League: 87 appearances, 30 goals

UEFA Cup/Europa League: 42 appearances, 11 goals

Other: 5 appearances, 1 goal

TOTAL: 695 appearances, 180 goals

Liverpool's iconic No 8 has won nine major trophies during his time on Merseyside - including the club's unforgettable Champions League triumph against AC Milan in 2005.

Despite his impressive list of honours, Gerrard has never won the Premier League - a fact detractors look to point out when comparing the midfielder to other Kop heroes and greats of his generation.

Former Liverpool player and manager Dalglish though, who won 19 major trophies in two separate spells with the Reds, believes that notion is a myth because every top player in the history of the game has failed to win something in their careers.

Writing in his column for the Mirror, the 63-year-old wrote: 'Everybody who has ever played football at the top level has failed to win everything they wanted to win. Me? Well we could have won three Doubles at Liverpool in my time as a player. But we didn’t.

'There’s always something you feel you have missed out on. There’s always something that people can throw at you. You know what that’s called? It’s called sport.

'In time, you come to understand that the most important thing is the trophies you have won. You are defined by them, not by the trophies you didn’t win. And Steven won the Champions League.

'He lifted his team to the most prestigious title in the game. He led the club in that astonishing victory in Istanbul in 2005.

'At that stadium on the outskirts of the city, he wrote his name even larger in the history of his club.'

Gerrard's achievements for the five-time European champions undoubtedly make him of one of the greatest-ever players to play for Liverpool.

Dalglish though, who is another to fall into that category, believes that it is impossible to determine if he is the greatest-ever at the club; due to the fact that it is hard to compare and contrast players from different eras. 

'When Billy Liddell was in his pomp after the Second World War, everybody said he was the greatest. They called Liverpool ‘Liddellpool’ in his honour. Everyone has their favourites and Steven has been a hero to this generation,' he added.
