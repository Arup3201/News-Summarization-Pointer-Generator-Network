Four friends of a Prince's Trust manager who collapsed after taking ecstasy during a 'lad's weekend' away could face jail after admitting charges relating to his death.

Nick Bonnie, who had worked for Prince Charles's young persons' charity for eight years, is believed to have swallowed a pill from what police described as a 'bad batch'.

The 30-year-old from Stroud, Gloucestershire, and five of his friends were taken to hospital after becoming ill at the Warehouse Project nightclub in Manchester on September 27, last year. 

Mr Bonnie, who had attended one of the Queen’s garden parties at Buckingham Palace, was pronounced dead the following morning.

His friends James Churchill, 30, Simon Lloyd-Jones, 29, Dean Neale, 30, and Paul Tabb, 31, all from Stroud, have admitted charges relating to the death. 

The group have been warned by a judge at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester they could be sent to prison when they are sentenced later in the year.

Churchill admitted three charges of supplying controlled Class A drug MDMA, three allegations of supplying cocaine and  a charge of perverting the course of justice.

Neale admitted one charge of possessing MDMA, possessing cocaine and perverting the course of justice by providing a false witness statement, while Lloyd-Jones has also admitted perverting the course of justice.

Today, Tabb had been due to stand trial charged with perverting the course of justice but changed his plea to guilty.

The particulars of the charge were that 'on September 27 with intent to pervert the course of justice by providing a false account to the police in relation to the incident concerning the supply of drugs to Nick Bonnie.'

Friends: Paul Tabb (left) today admitted perverting the course of justice, having previously pleaded guilty to possessing MDMA and cocaine. James Churchill has admitted three charges of supplying controlled Class A drug MDMA, three allegations of supplying cocaine and a charge of perverting the course of justice

He had admitted possessing MDMA and cocaine at an earlier hearing. 

All four men are on bail and are due to be sentenced on October 3, when it is expected a victim impact statement from Mr Bonnie's mother Pauline, who works in drug rehabilitation, will be read out.

Speaking at the time of Mr Bonnie's death, his mother and father, Andy, said: 'This news has devastated the lives of us, Nick's two brothers Thomas and Ryan, and his beautiful devoted girlfriend, Leah. Our family and friends, Nick's friends, work colleagues, all those who had the privilege of knowing him and those he helped in his employment with the Princes Trust, are equally devastated.

'Bad batch': Mr Bonnie, who had worked for Prince Charles's young persons' charity for eight years, is believed to have swallowed a pill from what police described as a 'bad batch'

'Stupid mistake': Mr Bonnie's parents said that he had 'lived life to the max', but that 'one stupid mistake' had cost him his life'

Tragedy: Mr Bonnie's family said they were 'devastated' by the charity worker's death

'Nick was born in King's Stanley and went to the local primary school. He progressed to Marling before taking a gap year and travelling around Australia before gaining his degree at university in Plymouth. He returned home to work with a local firm of solicitors in Stroud before embarking on the true vocation of his life, working with the Princes Trust.

'He has helped many young people in the early stages of his employment there and helped raise funds and promote the profile of the Trust in his current role. He has been to Highgrove on several occasions and attended one of the Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace.

'Nick played local football for King's Stanley youth teams up until the age of 16, Leonard Stanley Under 18s, Brimscombe & Thrupp and finally, Cashes Green. Nick was a keen sportsman, avid follower of Liverpool FC and only last week completed the "Tough Mudder" challenge for Help for Heroes in Wales.

'Nick was known by many as having a big heart, big personality and the most infectious smile in Stroud.

'Our thanks go out to all those who have taken the time to send messages of support to our family. Our lives and all those who were blessed to share a part in his life, are broken. Our life will never be the same without Nick and he will never be forgotten.

'Everyone who knew Nick was aware he loved life, lived it to the max and in making one stupid mistake he has cost himself his life.

'We hope that after reading this, we may have gone some way in helping anyone/ everyone in the realisation that drinking and use of any illicit drugs are a killer with consequences that will devastate lives for ever.'
