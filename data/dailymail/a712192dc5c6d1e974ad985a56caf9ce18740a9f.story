Although the brave K9 is still in critical condition at the Yorba Linda Regional Animal Hospital, Anaheim Police Officer Brett Klevos said hat Bruno is 'making leaps and bounds considering what he has been through. He is still being given heavy antibiotics and is on heavy sedation to hopefully keep him improving and keep him on the road to recovery.'

In an email sent to colleagues Sunday afternoon, Klevos wrote that on Saturday night, Bruno received a blood transfusion from another dog on the force. And on Sunday, Bruno's catheter was removed.

'It was exhausting for K9 Bruno, but a great sign,' Klevos added. 'The swelling has gone slightly down in his jaw. They made a special paste out of his prescription food and he was able to consume it with his back teeth.'

Although Bruno has a long way to go and is not seeing visitors amid an outpouring of public support, Klevos said that we could see more of “Bruno”  in his eyes today.'

Bruno, a 7-year-old Sable German Shephard, was shot Thursday afternoon trying to apprehend a suspect who shot at probation officers who were at the home of a man they were checking in on. The man was with two friends at the time, both of whom ran after spotting the officers.

One of the officers walked down an alley to see if he could find the men when he was shot at, Anaheim Police spokesman Lt. Tim Schmidt told KTLA. 

When Bruno and his partner, Officer RJ Young arrived about an hour later, the K9 went searching for the men. When the dog found one of the them hiding by a trash bin in the courtyard of a nearby apartment complex, according to the Orange County Register, the perpetrator fired several shots at the dog and officers, with one of the 
bullets striking Bruno in his jaw.

Officers fired back, killing 21-year-old Robert Moreno Jr. The man who probation officers were set to interview was taken into custody, but the third man escaped. Police say all three are suspected gang members.

Officer Young took his injured partner to 
the Animal Hospital, where Bruno underwent three-hour surgery.
 Since the round traveled from his jaw into his chest area, veterinarians had to remove
 part of Bruno's lung. They also had to reconstruct his lower jaw.

On Saturday, a 'pack walk' was held in Anaheim to support Bruno, NBC Los Angeles reported. Many dogs and their owners walked around the area near the animal hospital where Bruno is recovering.

Since the shooting, hundreds of 
thousands of messages has been posted on the police department's 
Facebook page, Twitter account and other forms of social media.

'Those of us at the police department 
are touched by the unbelievable outpouring of support from the community
 and across the nation and world' said Schmidt. 'Bruno did his job this 
week, locating a dangerous suspect and very likely saving officers’ 
lives. And since then, he has shown a remarkable will to live.'

Other police departments are sending Bruno well wishes, from as nearby as Los Angeles to as far away as Oregon and Texas.

Police in Denton,Texas tweeted, '@AnaheimPD glad to hear! K-9 Gino & his handler as well as the rest of DPD sends our thoughts and prayers out to K-9 Bruno & his handler.'
