In February, Fahma launched a petition to Michael Gove, former Secretary for Education, asking him to write to all schools reminding them of their duty to safeguard girls from (FGM).

In less than a month, the petition had gathered more than 230,000 signatures and Fahma and other members of the youth-led charity Integrate were invited to come and discuss the topic in the houses of parliament. 

Following their meeting, Michael agreed to write to teachers at all schools, to make them aware of the issue. 

She also had a starring role in the play, My Normal Life that raises different issues surrounding violence against women and girls,

After receiving the award today, she said: 'There are so many women in the UK campaigning for what they believe in and it still hasn’t sunk in that the judges chose to give me this award.

'This award is for all the young people of Integrate Bristol who have worked so hard over the past five years - I feel it's acknowledging the importance of eradicating FGM and protecting the rights of girls all over the world.'
