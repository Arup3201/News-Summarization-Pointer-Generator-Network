Most of us struggle to lose more than a couple of pounds over a month but a Welsh mother-of-two claims to have discovered the secret of speedy - and sustained - weight loss.

Rosie Grech, 23, from Treharris near Merthyr Tydfil, lost an impressive two stone in 90 days and says she hopes to inspire other women struggling with their weight.

Ms Grech, who is mother to Zaria, two, and Zak, eight months, says that she was spurred into dieting after finding it hard to lose her baby weight following the birth of her youngest child.

Super-slimmer: Rosie Grech lost a staggering two stone in less than three months and is now a model

Tipping the scales at 10.5st, she struggled to find time to exercise and eat healthily to lose the weight.

Instead of springing back into shape, she said she was left feeling deeply unhappy and 'no longerÂ  herself.'

'I've always been slim and after having my second baby I gained two stone, which I didn't lose,' explained Ms Grech.

'That's when my weight became a real issue for me, I guess I thought it would just come off again but that didn't happen.'

Improvement: Rosie was unhappy after gaining two stone while pregnant but has since lost it all

Happy family: Rosie with her fiance Wayne Ewer and their two children, Zaria, two, and Zak, eight months

But she said her fortunes changed 
when her fiance, Wayne Ewer, came back from shopping one day with a 
flyer for the Body by Vi 90 Day Challenge and a sample shake.

'Finding
 time for a quick bath was hard enough, let alone visiting the gym,' she
 explained. 'I needed something that could fit in with my busy family 
life.'

Three months after giving birth to Zak, Rosie began her diet, aiming to lose the extra two stone as quickly as possible.

By day 45 of her challenge, she was thrilled to have lost a stone. The final pounds were shifted by adding exercise to the routine, allowing her to reach her goal within 90 days.

'It has been like a dream come true,' adds Ms Grech. 'I have to keep pinching myself to remind myself.'

And more success was to come, after she was named the UK winner in the first Vi 90-day challenge competition.

Her prize: a contract with Silver Model Management which represents sports and lifestyle models and athletes.

The agency has provided models for top companies including Nike, Holister and L'Oreal as well as featuring in the pages of magazines such as Women's Health and Cosmopolitan.

'When I heard about the competition I was so excited,' Rosie added. 'I never thought I would win!"I hope that lots of other mums see what I have achieved and it inspires them.'
