George Osborne invoked Margaret Thatcher's warning that political parties could only be successful if they reflect modern society

George Osborne launched an emphatic defence of gay marriage yesterday, saying the Tories will not win the next election unless they drop their opposition to it.

He urged the party to emulate US President Barack Obama  by appealing to young voters and women with a socially liberal message.

But the Chancellor's intervention provoked anger on the Tory Right, with campaigners claiming that proposals to legalise gay marriage could cost the Conservatives more than a million votes and 30 seats.

One MP said the 'social liberal values of Notting Hill don't translate well outside the M25', while a former Tory minister warned that Army chaplains could face the sack if they disagree with the plans.

Writing in The Times, Mr Osborne said most voters support gay marriage and politicians should 'reflect the modern societies they aspire to lead'.

He quoted Margaret Thatcher saying the Tories should respond to 'people and how they want to live their lives'.

The Coalition has pledged to legalise gay marriage before 2015, but it is not part the Government's current legislative programme.

However, Mr Osborne used  his article to argue that it is a  vital plank of Conservative re- election plans.

He said the party should heed the lessons of Mr Obama's election success despite poor economic conditions.

In a robust shot across the bows of 
the Tory Right, Mr Osborne said voters on both sides of the Atlantic 
want economic toughness and social liberalism.

He added that Mr Obama sealed victory
 once he started making the case that the deficit should be tackled and 
showed that he 'was on the side of ordinary, hard- working voters'.

But crucially, he said the Tories, 
like Mr Obama's opponent Mitt Romney, could lose supporters who agree 
with them on the economy if they are not in tune with them on social 
issues as well.

He wrote: 'President Obama's 
high-profile endorsement of equal marriage for gay couples enthused 
younger voters. But polls found that a majority of all Americans 
supported him on the issue and voted for it in all four states that held
 ballots.'

US President Barack Obama used an ABC News interview in May this year to say he believed same-sex couples should be allowed to marry

Mr Osborne continued: 'I wouldn't 
change the current abortion laws and I strongly support gay marriage on 
principle. I am proud to be part of a government that will introduce a 
Bill to allow gay marriage.

'It is worth reflecting that in 
Britain, as in America, a clear majority of the public support gay 
marriage, and an even bigger majority of women support it.

'That majority support is just as high in the North as it is the South, and it is equally high among all socio-economic groups.

Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth has warned the Ministry of Defence that military chaplains could be sacked if they oppose gay marriage

'Successful political parties reflect
 the modern societies they aspire to lead. As Margaret Thatcher said in 
the first sentence of her introduction to the 1979 Conservative election
 manifesto: “The heart of politics is not political theory, it is people
 and how they want to live their lives”.'

The Coalition for Marriage, which 
opposes gay marriage, dismissed Mr Osborne's claims and announced that 
it will campaign in tomorrow's Corby by-election against a redefinition 
of the institution. Colin Hart, the organisation's campaign director, 
said: 'The PM and the Chancellor must stop misleading the public. The 
polls actually show that a majority of voters do not support the 
redefinition of marriage.

'It's time for senior politicians – 
particularly Mr Cameron, Clegg and Osborne – to get a grip and start 
talking about the issues that really matter, like reviving the economy, 
not redefining marriage.'

He highlighted a poll by the research
 consultancy ComRes that found that redefining marriage could cost the 
Tories up to 30 parliamentary seats and 1.1million votes. 'Ordinary 
people in places like Corby want action on the economy and public 
services, not meddling with marriage,' he said.

Tory backbencher Stewart Jackson 
said: 'The focus should be less on these social liberal obsessions  of 
West London and more on  blue-collar issues like the cost of living, 
mortgages and reducing taxes for families.

'The social liberal values of Notting Hill don't translate well outside the M25.'

Former defence minister Sir Gerald 
Howarth has written to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warning that 
military chaplains face being disciplined if the Government forces 
through its plans.

He wrote: 'Under the Government's 
proposals if the definition of marriage is rewritten, then those 
chaplains who maintain their support for the traditional/biblical 
meaning could face disciplinary action and even dismissal.'

The former minister also dismisses recent assurances from the Government that it can protect churches from prosecution.

He said: 'The Government is keen to 
assert that no clergy declining to offer a marriage service to 
homosexuals will be subject to discrimination or penalty, an undertaking
 ministers are in no position to give since the interpretation of any 
new law will rest with the courts and, ultimately, the impertinent 
European Court of Human Rights.'
