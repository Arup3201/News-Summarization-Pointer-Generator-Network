Scientists believe that we can use our sense of smell to detect fat in foods

We use many methods - from calories to carb-counting to point-recording - to work out which food is best for us.

But now scientists have discovered that a dieter's best friend may be right in front of their nose.

Researchers believe that we can use our sense of smell to detect fat in foods.

U.S. researchers think their discovery could help people learn to regulate their diets and to include less fat in the future.

Scientists at the Monell Centre, Philadelphia, said that as smell is almost always detected before taste, their study identifies one of the first sensory qualities that signals whether a food contains fat.

Innovative methods using scents to make low-fat foods more palatable could someday aid public health efforts to reduce dietary fat intake.

‘The human sense of smell is far better at guiding us through our everyday lives than we give it credit for,’ said senior author Dr Johan Lundström, a cognitive neuroscientist at Monell.

‘That we have the ability to detect and discriminate minute differences in the fat content of our food suggests that this ability must have had considerable evolutionary importance,’ he added.

As the most calorically dense nutrient, fat has been a desired energy source across much of human evolution and experts think it would have been advantageous for humans to be able to detect sources of fat in food.

Sweet taste is thought to signal a source of carbohydrate energy.

Scientists know humans use sensory cues to detect fat, but they do not know exactly which senses contribute to this ability.

The researchers reasoned that fat detection using smell has the advantage of identifying food sources from a distance.

While previous research had determined that humans could use odours to detect high levels of pure fat in the form of fatty acids, it was not known whether it was possible to detect fat in food.

Humans use our sense of smell to detect fat in foods.

The ability could have 'considerable evolutionary significance,' the researchers said.

People from different cultures were able to detect different amounts of fat in milk samples.

There was no relation between a person's weight and the ability to discriminate fat.

Scientists will now try to identify the odour molecules that allow people to detect different levels of fat.

Fat molecules are not airborne so they are unlikely to be sensed simply by sniffing.

Sophisticated chemical analyses is needed to work out why humans have the ability to detect fat using our noses.

In their experiment, researchers set out to see if people could detect and differentiate the amount of fat in milk.

They asked healthy participants to smell milk containing an amount of fat that might be encountered in a typical milk product: either 0.125 per cent, (skimmed) 1.4 per cent (semi-skimmed or reduced fat) or 2.7 per cent fat (normal milk – although full fat is usually classified as 3.25 to 3.5 per cent fat).

The milk samples were presented to blindfolded subjects in three vials. Two of the vials contained milk with the same fat content, while the third contained milk with a different fat concentration.

The subjects' task was to smell the three vials and identify which of the samples was different and the experiment was conducted three times using different sets of subjects.

The first used average weight people from the Philadelphia area, the second was conducted in ‘a different cultural setting’ in the Wageningen area of the Netherlands and the third study, also conducted in Philadelphia, examined fat detection both in normal weight and overweight subjects.

In all three experiments, participants could use their sense of smell to discriminate different levels of fat in the milk, according to the study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE.

This ability did not differ in the two cultures tested, even though people in the Netherlands on average consume more milk on a daily basis than Americans.

There also was no relation between weight status and the ability to discriminate fat.

Dr Sanne Boesveldt, lead author of the study and a sensory neuroscientist at the centre, said: ‘We now need to identify the odour molecules that allow people to detect and differentiate levels of fat.

‘Fat molecules typically are not airborne, meaning that they are unlikely to be sensed by sniffing food samples.

‘We will need sophisticated chemical analyses to sniff out the signal.’
