Bloodied: Harrison Ford is carried away from the scene of his plane crash on Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles on Thursday

Keeping vigil: Calista Flockhart was seen leaving the Los Angeles hospital after another lengthy visit with her husband who broke his pelvis while crash landing his vintage plane on a golf course

Emergency care: The 72-year-old's head is seen covered on bandages and his neck was put in a brace as he was wheeled off of the golf course and into the back of an ambulance

Response: The Indiana Jones and Fugitive star was then taken to hospital where his wife, Calista Flockhart, is staging a bedside vigil 

Ford's wife, Calista Flockhart has stayed close to his side at hospital.

The 50-year-old actress emerged on Friday night appearing tired and emotionally drained following a bedside vigil that lasted several hours.

Calista was seen at the wheel of a black Lexus pulling out of the hospital parking garage with an older male companion in the passenger seat.

The former Ally McBeal star looked like she hadn't slept in a while, her face make-up free and eyes dark-circled and bleary from possible crying.

Her light brown hair hung limply around her face and her manner of dress appeared simple and casual as though she'd grabbed the closest clothing in reach.

Calista looked like she needed sleep and was perhaps heading home to recharge for a spell with the intent of returning to the actor's side soon. 

Wrapped up: Paramedics unroll bloodied bandages around the actor's face. He deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground when the engine failed while flying solo

Treatment: Ford's arm is seen flung across his chest as he is treated by first responders. He broke his pelvis during the crash in his vintage plane 

Cautious: He is gently rolled onto his side by members of the fire department as he is placed on a stretcher 

On Thursday afternoon, Ford received a visit in hospital from his wife, who was seen looking emotional in her car.

A doctor has revealed Ford was moaning in pain, slumped over in the cockpit, when he landed.

'He was stunned a bit,' said spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana. 'He was moaning and in pain.'

'It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious,' Khurana told ABC News. 

A video has since emerged of the moment the plane started to drop.  

As Ford descended, the people playing golf at the time were captured on film gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way. 

Dr Khurana was golfing next to Santa Monica Airport when he saw the plane 'belly flop' and rushed to the fairway where it came to rest.

He told TV stations in Los Angeles and GMA that aside from worrying about Ford's injuries from the impact, he saw fuel leaking out of the World War II-era plane.

Patrick Jones, an official with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), told reporters in Venice, California that investigators were inspecting the wreckage as well as reviewing documents pertaining to the upkeep of the plane. 

'The aircraft will be examined, the engine will be examined, the records of the aircraft will be examined and ultimately we'll submit a factual report,' Jones said. 

'All of that process is going to take probably a couple of weeks to a month or so,' the NTSB official said. The final report probably will not be out for a year.' 

Impact: A doctor has revealed Ford was moaning in pain, slumped over in the cockpit, when he landed

Support: The injured actor is surrounded by first responders as he is taken away on a stretcher 

Jones said that the plane being as old as it is in many ways makes the investigation more straightforward.

'This aircraft is a fairly simple aircraft,' he said.

'A lot of it is old-school mechanical. We'll see what it is, we'll look at everything.'

Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, flew out of Santa Monica Airport in the Ryan PT-22 Recruit when he experienced engine trouble just minutes into the flight. He was trying to return to the airport when he crashed.

Authorities said they have not yet had the opportunity to interview Ford, but plan to do so over the course of their probe.

The actor suffered multiple gashes to his head and was left bleeding after the crash.

A family spokesman said Ford's injuries were not life-threatening. His son Ben, in a tweet late Thursday, said his father was 'battered, but OK.' 

Downed: Investigators surround the plane's wreckage. The National Transportation Safety Board say the probe into the crash could take up to a year 

Probe: Investigators are examining the wreckage and documents pertaining to the upkeep of the plane in order to determine what happened 

Scene: Golf bags surround the crash site in the aftermath on Thursday. Many players on the course at the time rushed to Ford's side when the plane went down 

Tired and emotionally drained: The 50-year-old actress appeared understandably distraught 

Support system: Calista was accompanied by a silver-haired male companion

Heading home: The weary-looking Calista was perhaps heading home to recharge before making the drive back to hospital 

In good hands: Harrison Ford, 72, was last listed in fair to moderate condition in hospital

Fuel leak: The injured actor was pulled from the wreckage as the smell of gasoline filled the air

He and other golfers pulled Ford from the wreckage. Others threw dirt on the fuel so it wouldn't catch fire.

Along with his friends who were golfing, Dr Khurana pulled Ford from the wreckage as the smell of gasoline filled the air.

'We wanted to get him out safely and with the fuel leaking out, I motioned to some of the other folks at the golf course to put dirt on the fuel so it wouldn't combust,' he said to CBS News.

'I just wanted to get him out safely so that the situation wouldn't erupt into a fire.'

On Thursday, a teary-eyed Calista was seen looking emotional while heading to hospital to visit her husband Harrison in hospital.

She had a handkerchief pressed to her nose and her eyes appeared to be tinged in red.

Saved: Dr. Sanjay Khurana, who had been golfing when Ford's plane crashed, later said, 'It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his Star Wars films'
