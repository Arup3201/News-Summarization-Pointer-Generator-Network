Looking polished and contented at a family party, one-time call girl Ashley Dupre, made famous for bedding former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, posed next to her fiancé after it was revealed she was expecting the couple's first child in two months.

The New Jersey native revealed to the New York Post that she is set to wed long-time love, Thomas 'TJ' Earle now that he is divorced from the wife he cheated on with Miss Dupre only months after the 'Love Guv' scandal broke.

The pair were pictured at a family celebration in New Jersey in April. Much has changed for the one-time prostitute, 27, who, aside from her romantic news, opened a lingerie and swimwear store in Redbank in May.

Moving on: Ashley Dupre, the one-time call girl who bedded ex New York governor Eliot Spitzer, is engaged to Thomas 'TJ' Earle and is pregnant

The high life: Ashley Dupre, the former call girl who became world famous for her tryst with Eliot Spitzer, announced she was engaged and pregnant in August

Rumours have been circulating since Femme by Ashley customers started noticing the large 'rock' on Ms Dupre's finger and her obviously swollen stomach, but details of the wedding plans and sex of the baby were being kept a secret.

Asked about her pregnancy, Ms Dupre told the Post, 'So far so good!'

She and Mr Earle began an illicit affair shortly after news of her dealings with Mr Spitzer hit the headlines but the asphalt heir was still married to wife Alisa with whom he has two children.

After meeting at a Jersey Shore restaurant, Mr Earle had reportedly boasted to a friend: 'I could have had her for free.'

Scandal number two: Ms Dupre set the rumour mill spinning again in 2008 when she was spotted getting out of a car in New York City with then married Thomas Earle (pictured above) to whom she is now engaged

When their steamy affair was exposed later, the Earle Companies executive publicly apologised to his wife calling his actions a 'grave mistake'.

Ms Dupre meanwhile, went on to make a 
name for herself, this time as a New York Post agony aunt, fielding 
questions from readers on sex and relationships and being commended by 
many for her bravery in speaking out about her experience.

In a final piece for the column, to which she contributed for two and half years, she said: 'I'm proud to say that Ask Ashley has been a greater success then I ever thought.

'Not a financial one, but rather a success in letting people see that I'm more than just the girl in the headlines from 2008.'

When Mr Spitzer was accused of paying Ms Dupre $2,000 for sex at a Washington hotel the night before Valentine's Day in 2008, a can of worms was opened that revealed the governor's long time penchant for expensive call girls and culminated in his resignation.

Now making headlines for all the right reasons, Ms Dupre says she's 'matured' and has 'moved on' from the scandal.

According to Mr Earle's lawyer, Mitchell Ansell, his client and ex-wife Alisa have been divorced for over a year and are on good terms.

He confirmed: 'They divorced amicably. She has moved on, and he has moved on. There’s nothing scandalous. No one's running around. [Ashley] is pregnant, and [TJ and Ashley] are planning on getting married.'

'Everyone is looking forward to the future,' Ms Dupre told the Post.
