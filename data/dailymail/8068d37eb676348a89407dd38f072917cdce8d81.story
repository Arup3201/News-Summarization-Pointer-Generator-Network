The dramatic opening scenes of the hit James Bond film Casino Royale has been recreated - entirely out of Lego.

Every single shot from James Bond's famous gun barrel pose to the brutal bathroom fight scene starring Daniel Craig has been perfectly replicated in the three minute 29 second clip.

The video was produced by 26-year-old Lego enthusiast who runs the online community for 'everything Lego' called Bricktease.

Scroll down for video

The opening scene: A car pulls up outside a building in Prague in the black and white clip - just like in the original Casino Royale film

Lego man: The MI6 officer head to office in the building lift - unaware James Bond is waiting for him

Waiting game: The MI6 agent then spots James Bond played by Daniel Craig, pictured in Lego form, sitting in the office

It took him three weeks in total to make the clip using stop motion animation to retell the story of the opening sequence, scene by scene, against the sound reel from the actual film.

Just like in the movie, Bond is sitting in a chair in the dark waiting for a MI6 section chief he has been tasked with killing.

It even includes the flashback to Bond's first kill - a gritty bathroom brawl ending with Bond's assailant drowned in a sink - before he kills his current target.

And despite being made out of Lego, the clip - which is all in black and white just like the movie - retains the mystique of the original film.

Writing on www.bricktease.com, the creator of the Lego clip said: 'I started work on Casino Royale about three weeks ago. 

Confrontation: James Bond accuses the MI6 agent of leaking secret information for money in the clip which has identical camera angles to actual film

Attention is in the detail: The clip, which took three weeks to complete, even features James Bond's flash back of the first man he killed

Lego art: The 26-year-old creator of the clip - who founded the website Bricktease - used stop motion animation to make the video

'I spend a fair bit of time going through the video and working out what scenes and camera angels there are, and plan my work to suit, so I don’t waste any time.

'I spent about two or three weeks actually filming, when I had a spare hour or two I would find a short scene or shot and do that.

'I find that planning it all out really helps me work quickly and efficiently.'

Asked how he made the clip, he added: 'Practice. If you see some of my very first videos, they are pretty amateur. Wobbly camera, dodgy movement of pieces etc… over the last few videos I have been trying to get as smooth as possible. And I still have a long way to go!'

He added that he always strives to use Lego as much as possible - such as the clear bricks representing the water in the sink.

Set up: When the clip reverts back to the office, the MI6 agent attempts to shoot James Bond, but he has removed the bullets from his gun

Now a 007: James Bond then shoots the agent before another quick flashback to the bathroom where he shoots his first ever a kill

Iconic: The famous gun barrel fills the scene as the James Bond theme tune starts to play

He continued: 'I have a personal preference that I want the videos to be as immersive as possible. So you don’t see anything that isn’t Lego unless you absolutely have to.

'It is really hard to get lips moving that looks realistic, so I am avoiding it for now. But I will one day work out how to do it (and do it well).'

The video has greeted with delight by Bond and Lego fans alike with 364,857 people having watched it on YouTube.

Despite calls for Bricktease to make an entire Lego version of the film, he admitted he didn't have enough actual Lego to do that.

But he added he will be making a new clip every single month this year.
