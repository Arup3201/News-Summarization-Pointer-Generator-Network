Louis van Gaal hit out at Angel di Maria after the Argentinian was sent off for grabbing referee Michael Oliver's shirt in Manchester United's FA Cup quarter-final defeat by Arsenal.

The Gunners set up a semi-final meeting against either Reading or Bradford thanks to a 2-1 win over 10-man United at Old Trafford.

Former United striker Danny Welbeck returned to haunt Van Gaal by scoring the winner after Wayne Rooney had equalised Nacho Monreal's opener.

The main talking point from the match was the latest episode in what has been a largely disappointing start to Di Maria's career at Old Trafford.

After being cautioned for simulation, the former Real Madrid midfielder remonstrated with referee Oliver and then grabbed the back of his shirt and yelled at the official when he had turned his back on him.

Replays showed the first booking on Di Maria was harsh and Aaron Ramsey had pulled the player back, but the £60million man's actions thereafter deserved sanction, according to Van Gaal.

'I think he's touched the referee and that's forbidden in every country, so he has no excuses,' the United manager said.

'In Spain he knows that he doesn't touch the referee, but that is also in his emotion.

'I've already spoken with him, he knows my opinion but also I have to see on the video.'
