London’s former mayor Ken Livingstone was joined by Shadow Olympics minister Tessa Jowell today to pay tribute to the 7/7 victims on the sixth anniversary of the bus and Tube bombings.

They gathered at 8:50 am this morning, the same time that the first suicide bomb exploded on July 7, 2005, in the tragedy that left 52 commuters dead in total.

Wreaths were laid at the Memorial in Hyde Park by Home Secretary Theresa May and the London Ambulance Service’s deputy director of operations Jason Killens.

Jowell and Livingstone recalled how they heard the news six years ago while in Singapore, after London was announced to be the host of the 2012 Olympics.

Ms Jowell said: ‘We immediately cut the celebrations to come back but the plane broke down and we were waiting for hours.’

Mr Livingstone added: ‘We found it really frustrating. We wanted to be back here.’

The most deadly of the attacks claimed 26 lives on a Piccadilly Line train, just before 9am in peak hour.

A memorial service for the victims’ families was held at lunchtime today.

Ms Jowell's tribute read: ‘We will never forget you’, while floral tributes were also left by London Underground staff and members of the Metropolitan Police.

John Smith, who worked at the BMA and an eyewitness to the attack on the 30 bus in Tavistock Square, also paid his respects at the memorial.

Meanwhile, survivors of the bombings also attended the memorial service to mark the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks.

Around 100 people observed a one minute silence and laid wreaths at the memorial sculpture in Hyde Park.

The names of all the victims were read out and four survivors of the attacks made speeches during the lunchtime service.

Many travelled across the world to pay their respects.

Nicola Stanley, who was on the Piccadilly Line train when one of the bombs went off said: ‘I remember the day clearly.

‘I couldn't help thinking, 'why am I still here?'. It felt so unfair. I read every newspaper article, watched every film and documentary to try and understand how anyone could do what they did and I came to the conclusion it was a pure act of evil.

‘London showed great strength after that day. They can never break our spirit. London is our city.’

Another survivor, Jacqui Putnam said: ‘I never knew any of the 52 victims but one thing I do know is how much they were loved.

‘I come here every year to remember them and I tell them that I do not walk alone. Through life they walk with me.’

At the end of the service organisers invited those who had been watching from under their umbrellas to lay sunflowers by the memorial plaque.

A group from the far right group, the English Defence League (EDL) also laid a wreath at the memorial. Fears they would hijack the event did not come to fruition.

On the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four terrorists, Hasib Hussain, Shehzad Tanweer, Jermaine Lindsay and Mohammad Sidique Khan, detonated four bombs, three on London Underground trains and a fourth on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square.

Around 700 commuters were injured during the attack, on top of those killed by the suicide bombers carrying explosives in their rucksacks.

A London tube station evacuated at rush hour amid a chemical alert on the sixth anniversary of the 7/7 terror attack has been declared safe.

Busy Monument station was evacuated when tube staff reported a strong smell of chemicals just before 8am.

Several emergency service vehicles raced to the scene and traffic around the London Bridge area ground to a halt.

However, after extensive tests were conducted by London fire Brigade investigators the station was declared safe and allowed to reopen at around 10am.

The scare was put down to an ammonia spillage in a storeroom.

A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: ‘We were called to a confirmed chemical incident at Monument underground station.’

Station Manager Daniel Alie said: ‘Firefighters carried out tests and found a small amount of ammonia had leaked in a basement storeroom. 

‘The ammonia wasn't at a harmful level. We're now satisfied that the area is safe and have handed the incident back to London Underground staff.’ 

He added: Both Monument and Bank underground stations were evacuated as a precaution. Bank station is now open. Firefighters will be leaving the scene soon. 

‘The Brigade was called at 7.47am and the incident was handed over to London Underground at 10am.’
