Melbourne has edged out three other Australian cities and world renowned destinations Vienna, Vancouver and Toronto as the globe's most liveable city for a fourth time.

Ranked against 140 cities worldwide, Melbourne scored top of the list for its lifestyle challenges ahead of Adelaide in fifth, Sydney in seventh and Perth in ninth, which were the three other Australian cities ranked in the top 10.

Brisbane finished 20 places below the Victorian capital which was given perfect scores out of 100 for health care, education and infrastructure and high scores of 95 for stability, culture and environment.

The Economist Intelligence Unit Survey considered any city with a rating of 80 or more had 'few, if any, challenges to living standards' while the lowest rating of 50 or less meant 'most aspects of living are severely restricted.'

Melbourne has remained top of the list since first taking over the number one ranking from Vancouver in 2011, which has slipped to third in the last three years.

The Austrian capital Vienna finished second to Melbourne, averaging 97.5 out of a possible 100.

Each of Australia's top four cities ranked scores of 94 or more for the five categories - Stability, Healthcare, Culture and environment, Education and Infrastructure.

The survey considered a score of one to be 'intolerable' while at the other end of the scale 100 was considered 'ideal'.

Adelaide, also known as the City of Churches, finished in fifth spot in the world rankings

The Syrian capital Damascus was ranked at the bottom of the list due to ongoing conflict in the war torn zone.

It scored just 109.6 out of a possible 500, an average of just 30.5 for each of its five categories, and dropped a massive 28 per cent over the last five years.

One of the key trends of the survey, according to its editor Jon Copestake, is the decline in livingÂ  standards for the lowest ranked cities.

He said while it is unsurprising to see little or no movement among the top ranked cities, a period of 'destabilisation' over the last five years has hit other cities hard.

Some 50 of the cities surveyed have seen declines in liveability over the last five years.

'Liveability trends tend to move slowly, so it is unsurprising to see little or no movement among the top ranked cities, but destabilisation has had a catastrophic impact for some cities with a possible knock-on effect in neighboring countries.'

Recent conflicts in Ukraine, Iraq, the Palestine and North Africa - as well as the recent global financial crisis - are all issues which have affected livability, the report stated.
