Ambala will be allowed to continue with his studies

A blundering serial thief who ransacked a flat which police had rigged with CCTV cameras and stole fake mobile phones has been jailed.

Dim Bubba Ambala, 19, was first caught raiding an apartment in his own block of flats which officers had set up with cameras in an elaborate sting operation.

But, despite being given a suspended sentence for that crime, he clearly had not learned his lesson.

Just six months later he was caught 
shoplifting from a high street store when he made off with three 
worthless display mobile phones which he thought were real.

The teenager admitted theft and was jailed for six months at Warwick Crown Court on Thursday.

Jailing
Ambala, Recorder Richard Bond told him he was being 'lenient' despite 
him committing the crime while serving a suspended sentence for the 
earlier burglary.

Recorder Bond said he wanted to give Ambala an opportunity to continue his IT studies at college.

He told him: 'I have to impose an 
immediate custodial sentence on you because you breached the suspended 
sentence within six months of it being imposed.

Caught on camera: Bubba Ambala tries to burgle a police capture house

Ambala escaped with a suspended 12-month prison sentence last year after admitting three counts of burglary

'It is within my power to impose a sentence of 12 months for the burglaries and a consecutive sentence for the theft.

'But I am impressed by the submissions made on your behalf and am going to give you a chance.

'I’m going to pass a sentence on you of six months, which means you will be released before that college course begins again.

'I was going to give you nine months, so this really is a case of the court being lenient towards you.'

Ambala,
from Birmingham, escaped with a suspended 12-month prison sentence last
September after admitting three counts of burglary.

He
was snared by police spy cameras which were set-up in a high-tech 
‘capture house’ after a spate of raids in the block of flats in 
Birmingham.

Bungling criminal Bubba Ambala has been caught stealing dummy telephones six months after he burgled a 'fake' police flat in his own block

The 19-year-old was handed a reduced six-month jail sentence this week by a judge who ruled he deserved a chance to continue with his college studies

They caught Ambala in August last year breaking in three times in just two days where he made off with cash, a pair of trainers and two T-shirts.

In March this year Ambala was caught pinching three dummy mobile phones which he believed were real from 3 Mobile shop in Solihull, West Midlands.

Theresa Hunt, defending, told the court: 'The theft was of small value, but the problem is the suspended sentence.

'He would like to enrol to complete a course he has started in IT which is due to continue in September.

'It’s the second year of the course and he successfully completed all the elements of the first year.'
