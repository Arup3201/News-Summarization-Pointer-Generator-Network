Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has boasted to a cheering crowd that the United States and other world powers 'surrendered' to Tehran with the new nuclear agreement struck in Geneva.

'Do you know what the Geneva agreement means? It means the surrender of great international powers before the great nation of Iran,' the moderate leader told a home crowd today.

Rouhani has cast the nuke deal as a national win in a bid to appease hardliners who claim the agreement tramples on Iran's enrichment rights. But commentators say the remarks are likely to rile members of Congress pressing for additional sanctions.

Rouhani also told the flag-waving crowd: 'The Geneva agreement means the world's acceptance of the peaceful technology that was obtained due to the efforts and sacrifices of our young scientists.

'The Geneva agreement means the breaking of sanctions that had been imposed wrongfully on this dear and peace-loving nation of Iran.'

The president re-iterated his comments on his personal Twitter account today.

'Our relationship w/ the world is 
based on Iranian nation's interests. In #Geneva agreement world powers 
surrendered to Iranian nation's will,' he tweeted.

Last week, the six-nation group - the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany - and Iran agreed to start implementing the terms of the November deal later this month.

Iran reportedly agreed to limit uranium enrichment and to open its nuclear program to daily inspection by international experts from January 20.

In exchange, the Islamic Republic will get a relaxation of the financial sanctions that have been crippling its economy.

Iran’s official IRNA news agency on 
Sunday said Iran will grant the United Nations’ watchdog - the 
International Atomic Energy Agency - access to its nuclear facilities 
and its centrifuge production lines to confirm it is complying with 
terms of the deal.

U.S. President Barack Obama, in a written statement announcing the arrangement, stressed that the sanctions relief is 'modest'.

Meanwhile, it is feared Rouhani's latest statement will fuel concern in Congress that Iran feels less pressure now to comply with the deal.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times reported that key elements of the arrangement were included in a 'secret', unpublished document.

According to the report, the private agreement includes details relating to a joint commission that would oversee Iran's 'right' to pursue nuclear research.

In an interview, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi referred to the side agreement as a  'nonpaper', a diplomatic term used for an informal agreement which doesn’t have to be publicly disclosed.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney yesterday said the text of the implementing agreement would be released to lawmakers.
