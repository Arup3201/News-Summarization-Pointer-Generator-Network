A fourth suspect has been arrested concerning the alleged forced labor of a mentally disabled woman held captive with her young daughter, according to federal prosecutors in Ohio.

Dezerah Silsby, 21, appeared in court on Thursday afternoon after turning herself in and denied that she helped threaten, beat and force the woman to do the suspects housework for two years.

Mentally-disabled Shannon Eckley and 
her five-year-old daughter were held in 'modern-day slavery' for two 
years by the four suspects in northeast Ohio who abused them and kept them in 
line with venomous snakes and pit bulls.

An FBI affidavit says Dezerah Silsby, 21, admitted she used ice cream to lure the woman and her daughter from their relative's house to captivity

The two victims were kept her in a room with a free-ranging iguana and ordered her to feed the reptile fruits and vegetables her daughter was denied, according to court papers.

'The living conditions were simply subhuman,' said Steven Dettelbach, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio.

The mother and daughter were sometimes forced to eat dog food, according to a law enforcement source with first-hand knowledge of the investigation.

They were also frequently denied access to the bathroom, FBI Special Agent Eric Smith told reporters on Tuesday.

Jessica Hunt, 31, and Jordie Callahan, 26 are accused of keeping Shannon Eckley as a slave for two years - threatening her and milking her of government benefits

An FBI affidavit says Silsby, 21, 
admitted she used ice cream to lure the woman and her daughter from 
their relative's house to captivity.

In
addition, the affidavit says, Silsby smashed the woman's hand with a 
rock so she could go to a hospital and bring back pain medication for 
the suspects.

Silsby 
was released after her brief court appearance on Thursday and ordered 
her to stay in contact with the probation office while awaiting trial.

She entered a not guilty plea and left the courthouse without commenting.

Defense attorney Jennifer Scott said Silsby isn't capable of the crimes detailed in the allegations.

‘She
has not done these things,’ Scott said outside court. ‘In the course of
the process of the justice system I believe the true facts will come to
light.’

Silsby, 
married with a 3-year-old and pregnant, has a demeanor and personality 
‘not of the type to manipulate and force individuals into the types of 
accusations that are being made,’ Scott said.

The other suspects, Jordie Callahan, 26,
Jessica Hunt, 31, and Daniel J. ‘DJ’ Brown, 33, all of Ashland, about 
60 miles southwest of Cleveland, were jailed to await a bond hearing on 
Monday.

They were arrested Tuesday, and Silsby surrendered in Ashland on Wednesday.

The attorney for Hunt said she will plead not guilty. The attorneys for Callahan and Brown declined to comment.

Callahan's
mother, Becky Callahan, said that the allegations were ‘all lies.’ She 
said that the woman was friends with her son and Hunt, her son's 
girlfriend, and that they tried to help the woman by offering her a 
place to live.

Beginning
in early 2011, the suspects forced the woman to cooperate with them by 
threats and physical abuse, federal prosecutors said.

The
woman told authorities she was forced to do housework by the suspects, 
who she said raided her bank account and menaced her with snakes and pit
bulls.

The woman and 
her daughter, who's 5-years-old, were freed in October after police 
investigated an abuse allegation one of the suspects made against her.

The Ashland case has dark similarities to last month's revelation in Cleveland that three women had been keep captive for a decade

Daniel Brown is accused of aiding Hunt and Callahan

Police
first got involved when the woman was arrested on a candy bar 
shoplifting case and asked to be jailed because people had been mean to 
her.

Authorities said 
the abuse allegation was a ruse complete with a video staged by the 
suspects. They said the suspects had forced the woman to act as if she 
were mistreating her child.

The
woman later pleaded guilty to child endangering and was sentenced in 
February to about five months in jail. She served only part of that 
sentence.

Between May 
2011 and October 2012, Eckley and her daughter were locked in the 
basement of an apartment in Ashland, Ohio, and forced to do housework 
and look after Hunt's four children.

All the while, Callahan and Hunt stole her government benefits and used the money on themselves, authorities say.

Eckley's enslavement bears chilling 
similarity to the case of Ariel Castro, the man who was charged last 
month with kidnapping three woman and keeping them against their will in
his house for ten years while he repeatedly raped, beat and emotionally
tortured them.

Castro's house of horrors is located in Cleveland, Ohio, 65miles northeast of Ashland.

Federal charges allege Callahan and Hunt also repeatedly beat Eckley and her toddler daughter.

When they were not beating them to keep them in line, they used their pets.

The pair kept a poisonous coral snake, a ball python and a Burmese python that weighed 130 pounds as well as lizards, spiders, scorpions and 'numerous' dogs - including pit bulls.

The pair used these pets to terrify and menage Eckley and her young daughter - threatening to turn them loose on the captives if they didn't behave.

Hunt, who works at Wendy's, is seen handling a snake, as well. The coupled owned numerous pets that they allegedly looked after better than Eckley

Callahan allegedly used dogs to threaten Eckley, as well

Callahan posted numerous photos on 
his Facebook page of he and Hunt handling the creatures. One picture 
shows a snake coiled around a rat. Another shows Callahan apparently 
feeding a live chicken to his massive Burmese python.

Callahan also allegedly used a gun to threaten Eckley on one occasion, as well.

Callahan
and Hunt invited Eckley and her daughter to come live with them in May 
2011. Authorities allege she arrived in a living hell. Once she moved 
in, the pair began treating her as a slave.

They
initially locked her in the basement and forced her to sleep on the 
concrete floor without a mattress. They deprived her of food - while 
lavishing attention on their animals.

The pair allegedly harvested the money Eckley received from government benefits and used the money for themselves. They also used her to get drugs.

In December 2011, Callahan allegedly bashed Eckley's hand with a rock. He then took her to a doctor - leaving her child at the apartment - and told her to request a prescription for Valium. Once she got the narcotics, Callahan and Hunt used them for themselves.

They executed the stunt a second time, as well. On that occasion, Callahan kicked Eckley in the hip.

Brown is accused of aiding Callahan and Hunt by allegedly catching Eckley when she tried to escape. Authorities say he lied to her and said he would help her when he saw her outside the apartment.

The couple also allegedly sent Eckley to the store to run errands, though they always kept kept her daughter at the house.

In October 2012, on one of her trips to the store, Eckley was arrested for shoplifting after stealing a candy bar.

She told police that she wanted to go jail because the people she lived with 'were mean to her.'

The officer then questioned Callahan and Hunt, who showed him the video of Eckley beating her child.

Eckley was arrested and charged, but further investigation revealed the the deplorable conditions she was living under, authorities say.
