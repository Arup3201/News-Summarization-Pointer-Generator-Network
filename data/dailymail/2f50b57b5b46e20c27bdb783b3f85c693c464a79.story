'The Birds' legend Tippi Hedren, 83, won a years long court battle Monday to receive the $1.5M in wages she lost after a gallon of water fell on her head while filming at a San Diego sound stage.

Hedren was rehearsing for the now defunct MyNetworkTV soap opera Fashion House when built-up water from an air conditioner fell on her head, she says causing her terrible headaches that prevented her from taking jobs.

Now, after first losing the suit on a technicality then suing her attorney for malpractice, Hedren has officially won her money.

All wet: Hollywood legend Tippi Hedren (here in 2013) won a suit Monday that began when a gallon of water fell on her head rehearsing on a San Diego sound stage

Headaches: Hedren was rehearsing for her role as a cancer-stricken grandmother in the short-lived cable soap opera Fashion House (pictured) in 2006 when she says the accident caused the debilitating headaches once repaired by back surgery to return

Ironically, the woman best known for dodging birds in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 classic may have been injured with the help of one.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the deluge was likely caused from a bird’s nest that had blocked air conditioning condensation tube.

Hedren initially sued the owner and lessee of Stu Segal Studios. She alleged the debilitating headaches she’d finally cured with spinal fusion had returned after the incident.

Her attorney Joseph Allen subsequently 
made a mistake in his discussions with the defendants that allowed them 
block him from filing suit, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

Three years later, Hedren sued Allen for malpractice.

Hedren won and a jury awarded her $1,483,708.

But Allen appealed and argued that Hedren’s own hectic lifestyle was to blame for her injuries and also that her employer was negligent.

On Monday, a California appeals court reaffirmed the award in Hedren’s favor.
