England eased to a 3-0 victory against Peru at Wembley on Friday night courtesy of a Daniel Sturridge strike and goals from centre backs Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka.

Pre-tournament
 hysteria was in short supply at Wembley among the prawn sandwich 
brigade, with large swathes of empty red spaces among the corporate 
seats. 

It
 was a near sell-out elsewhere - although many fans took to making paper
 aeroplanes during a languid first half. The planes raised a cheer when 
they reached the pitch - Joe Hart retrieved one - and the crowd 
certainly enjoyed it when another one hit a Peru player.

Didi 
Hamann is such an Anglophile now, he’s virtually gone native,
 tweeting on Friday night: ‘Sterling and Barkley would go straight into Germany’s team 
right now. They must have half a chance getting into England’s. They are
 special.’

That’s some praise given the German options of Thomas Muller,
 Mario Gotze, Marco Reus, Toni Kroos and Mesut Ozil.

Peru’s
 new coach Pablo Bengoechea had an unbeaten Wembley record prior to 
Friday night. He captained Uruguay here in 1995 in a less than 
compelling 0-0 draw, leading a team that included Enzo Francescoli and 
Gus Poyet. That rather uninspiring clash formed part of England’s Euro 
96 preparations under Terry Venables.

Let’s hope that, like that year, there are some fireworks when the real business begins.

One of the
 best features of Peruvian football - the iconic strip with the 
distinctive red sash - was sadly not on show last night with England 
playing in their all white home kit. 

The
 sight of Teofilo Cubillas racing away in the distinctive kit 
celebrating another goal in the 3-1 win over Scotland in 1978 will 
always bring a nostalgic smile to England fans.
