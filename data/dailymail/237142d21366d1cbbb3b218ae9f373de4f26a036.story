The most talented young player Sir Alex Ferguson has seen on a training pitch is on the market and available. Aged 21. On a free transfer.

It was three years ago when Manchester United became tired of his antics and sent him packing. Now West Ham too have reached the conclusion Ravel Ryan Morrison is damaged goods.

Banned from West Ham’s first-team training ground as they continue to flirt with the top six, Sam Allardyce has demanded that he ‘changes his whole life’ and — in the meantime — trains with the reserves elsewhere in Essex, away from their Chadwell Heath base.

Such is his declining reputation, Morrison — ambitiously considered by some to be a contender for the World Cup with England last summer — has let it be known that, if anyone will take him, he will sign a new contract with all the risk on his side.

Morrison is seeking a relatively modest £15,000 a week (the same wage he is paid by West Ham). And there is a further incentive for his next club: he is prepared to waive any right to compensation should a club terminate his employment for stepping out of line.

Even then, one Premier League chairman approached by Morrison’s advisers this week described it as ‘too risky’, and could not be convinced otherwise even when it was pointed out the risk was all Morrison’s.

In England, according to one source close to Morrison, clubs are ‘paralysed by fear’ when presented with the prospect of hiring him.

They can see he has ability, outrageous ability. And they remember the goals.

But they also fear, in the high-stakes world of Premier League football, that introducing Morrison to a dressing room could prove incredibly divisive.

One imagines they are influenced by the stories they hear; some well documented, some less so. But as events at Manchester Crown Court have demonstrated this week, not all of them are true.

Talking this week to people who have encountered Morrison, to people who know him extremely well too, the lack of consistency in their accounts of the 21-year-old is every bit as startling as the stories themselves.

One reason given for why West Ham lost patience with Morrison was the suspicion that he had been driving without a licence. It is true Morrison is yet to pass his test but his representatives insist that he, like any learner driver, always has a qualified driver of the correct age siting alongside him.

When the allegation was put to one source who was keen to defend Morrison, he rather worryingly replied: ‘He hasn’t done that (driven) for weeks and weeks.’

Concern about whether Morrison will turn up fuels the doubt in the boardroom, even among the Premier League’s most desperate clubs such as QPR, Hull and Aston Villa.

It is claimed he went AWOL for a few days during the Christmas period of 2013. The reason has since been given as emergency dental work, the records of which were then presented to the club. 

Over the years he does appear to have missed training without proper explanation and it is said he was even late reporting for a recent Under 21 game, although coaches at West Ham are said to have been impressed by the midfielder these past few weeks, not least with his attitude and application. And he can play.

Clearly the relationship with Allardyce has disintegrated, with claims and counter claims as to why that is. Allardyce has denied his own representatives once tried to recruit Morrison from his current agent when negotiations with the club over a new contract broke down. But Allardyce, like Sir Alex Ferguson before him, has decided he does not want the kid around, however good he might be.

After returning recently from an unsuccessful loan spell at Cardiff, Allardyce expressed his concern earlier this week that Morrison may ‘struggle’ to find a new club.

‘It’s the old metaphor isn’t it; you can lead the horse to water but you can’t make it drink,’ he said.

‘If they don’t want to take it on board, then there’s little they can do. It’s very difficult to sit and watch such a great talent. He just has to change his whole life and then hopefully somewhere down the line he’ll become the player he should be.’

It is not just Allardyce and Ferguson, either. Harry Redknapp had Morrison at QPR for a loan spell and is said to have ‘quite liked the lad’. He recognised, at least away from the pitch, that he could be polite and respectful. He even entertained the idea of having him back.

But Redknapp also reflected in his book how frustrating Morrison can be. ‘If he’d played consistently at his best, he might have gone to the World Cup,’ said Redknapp.

‘But on his bad days you wouldn’t put him in our reserve team.

‘The kid can really play. He goes past people and makes them look silly. He’s like Alan Hudson. He doesn’t run, he glides.

‘By the time we came to the end of the season, though, he couldn’t get in our starting line-up. He’s an amazing talent but his attitude makes you think about where he will be in six years’ time.’

Redknapp tells a story of how Morrison responded with a ‘petulant pout’ when he asked him ‘to do a job’ on the left flank in one game. And only after a serious talking-to did he respond the way his manager demanded.

‘In the second half it was like watching a player with Gareth Bale’s class in the Championship,’ writes Redknapp.

He also recalls a story told to him by Lee Clark, who as the manager at Birmingham City also had the player on loan. Clark told Morrison he was ‘the best player since Gazza’. ‘Who’s Gazza?’ Morrison is said to have replied.

This is not necessarily what puts off Premier League clubs and their managers.

It is the more serious stuff. The stuff that has led to Morrison appearing in a courtroom and only narrowly escaping a jail sentence in February 2011. Morrison received a 12-month referral order and was ordered to pay costs and compensation after admitting to two counts of witness intimidation.

It related to threats made to a mugging victim in an effort to stop him giving evidence against two people, described in court as ‘friends or associates’ of Morrison, accused of carrying out the attack. A district judge, warning that Morrison would be locked up for a year if he got in trouble again, described his behaviour as ‘appalling’.

A further charge of assault was dropped when Morrison’s girlfriend refused to testify. He was, however, convicted of criminal damage for throwing her mobile phone from a window and advised to undergo domestic violence counselling.

This week three more charges brought against Morrison, for assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother, were withdrawn at Manchester Crown Court. The prosecutor told the court the charges had been dropped after Morrison’s defence team recovered CCTV footage of the first alleged assault outside a Manchester nightclub.

The video showed Morrison had not hit his ex-girlfriend, as was alleged, and it appeared that she had simply ‘slumped’ to the floor. The young woman also withdrew her statement alleging Morrison later assaulted her outside her home when he dropped her off in his Porsche, while there was also ‘reluctance’ from her mother to proceed over the alleged assault on her.

His representatives dread to think what might have happened had that CCTV footage not materialised. After all, his ex-girlfriend is understood to have sustained injuries to her face when she fell. But even though the charges were withdrawn, with the CCTV evidence showing that he was actually rather chivalrous that night, some damage has been done.

A video of him emerging from Strangeways Prison after the initial arrest became a YouTube sensation available to any prospective employer.

Morrison is said to have been brought up by his grandparents in one of the more deprived areas of Greater Manchester, the impression being that he had a difficult upbringing.

This is not quite true. There was a spell when he lived with his grandparents and his childhood was not always easy. But a mother said to have strong moral principles is a central figure in his life.
