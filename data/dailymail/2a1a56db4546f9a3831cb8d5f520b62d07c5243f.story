Protesters marched Saturday in Washington, D.C., to protest government surveillance programs revealed this year by Edward Snowden on the 12th anniversary of the law that made them legal.

Carrying signs reading: ‘Stop Mass Spying,’ ‘Thank you, Edward Snowden’ and ‘Unplug Big Brother,’ people gathered at the foot of the Capitol to demonstrate against the online surveillance by the National Security Agency.

One protester also read a statement released by Mr Snowden prior to the rally.

Organizers estimated that more than 2,000 attended the demonstration, but Capitol Police said they do not typically provide estimates on the size of demonstrations.

The march made for unusual allies, with liberal privacy advocates walking alongside members of the conservative Tea Party movement – both sides oppose what they say is unlawful government spying on Americans.

‘I consider myself a conservative and no conservative wants their government collecting information on them and storing it and using it,’ said protester Michael Greene.

‘Over the past several months, we have learned so much about the abuses [of privacy] that are going on and the complete lack of oversight and the mass surveillance into every detail of our lives,’ demonstrator Jennifer Wynne said.

‘We need to tell Congress that they have to act,’ she added.

Though Mr Snowden could not attend the rally in person, he was very much a presence. With his picture and name on signs and placards, as well as his words being read aloud by activist Jesselyn Radack.

‘In the last four months, we’ve learned a lot about our government,’ Ms Radick read from a statement written by Mr Snowden. ‘We’ve learned that the US Intelligence Community secretly built a system of pervasive surveillance.’

'Today, no telephone in America makes a call without leaving a record with the NSA,’ she continued. ‘Today, no Internet transaction enters or leaves America without passing through the NSA’s hands… this isn’t about red or blue party lines. Neither is it about terrorism.’

The statement explained held surveillance up as the government’s way of wielding power.

Calling the actions unconstitutional and blasting the ‘surveillance state,’ Mr Snowden, as read by Ms Radick, called for ‘ordinary people from high schools to high office stand up to oppose a dangerous trend in government.’

‘We are told that what is unconstitutional is not illegal, but we will not be fooled,’ the statement said. 

‘We have not forgotten that the Fourth Amendment in our Bill of Rights prohibits government not only from searching our personal effects without a warrant but from seizing them in the first place,’ it continued.

‘We declare that mass surveillance has no place in this country.’

Growing outrage: The march comes as it has been revealed the US spied on the leaders of over 70 other countries, leading to more distrust of the US around the world

The event was organized by a coalition known as 'Stop Watching Us' that consists of some 100 public advocacy groups and companies, including the American Civil Liberties Union, privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation, Occupy Wall Street NYC and the Libertarian Party.

The groups have been urging Congress to reform the legal framework supporting the NSA's secretive online data gathering since Snowden's disclosure of classified information about the programs that are designed to gather intelligence about potential foreign threats.

The Obama administration and many lawmakers have defended the NSA programs as crucial in protecting U.S. national security and helping thwart past militant plots. They have also said the programs are carefully overseen by Congress and the courts.

Mr Snowden's disclosures have raised concerns that NSA surveillance may span not just foreign, but domestic online and phone communication.

'We are calling on Congress to take immediate action to halt this surveillance and provide a full public accounting of the NSA's and the FBI's data collection programs,' Stop Watching Us said in a letter addressed to members of Congress posted online, calling for a reform of the law known as the Patriot Act.

That law marked its 12th anniversary on Saturday. It was passed in 2001 to improve anti-terrorism efforts and is now under scrutiny by privacy advocates who say it allows 'dragnet' data gathering.

His latest disclosures showed that the United States may have tapped the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding to the growing outrage against U.S. data-gathering practices abroad and prompting a phone call between Merkel and President Barack Obama.

‘It is time for reform,’ the statement concludes. ‘Elections are coming and we’re watching you.’
