A married sports teacher was due in court today in connection with the alleged rape of a six-year-old student at a top private school in India.

The sports instructor, 30, was yesterday arrested in connection with the assault, which is alleged to have taken place at the school in Bangalore earlier this month, police have said.

A laptop containing child pornography was also seized from the instructor by officers, the city's police commissioner Raghavendra Auradkar has told reporters.

Auradkar said: 'The videos were downloaded from porn sites through the Internet.'

According to AFP, Auradkar also said: 'He is married and has a three-year-old child too. We will produce him in the local court on Monday and seek his custody for further interrogation and investigation,'

According to the International Business Times, Auradkar said 'most of the downloaded videos depicted children in uniform being raped.'

Reports of the rape sparked protests outside Vibgyor School, near the city's Kundalahalli Gate, as hundreds of parents pulled down its gates and shouted slogans.

Police have said the girl told a teacher about the incident at the school, although her parents were not made aware of it until she shared details with them a week later.

The incident is alleged to have taken place in a classroom at the school.Â

The International Business Times also quoted police claiming the man had been fired by another school after he was allegedly involved in a sexual assault case.

The matter was, however, reportedly not passed on to the police.

On Thursday, school chairman Rustom Kerawala addressed a meeting of the parents where he offered his 'sincere apologies' and promised 'full co-operation' with the police in the investigation.

According to parents, this was allegedly the third sexual molestation case in the school in the last six months, and the girls had revealed the same following the latest incident.

A new focus on sexual violence has swept the country since the 2012 gang-rape attack in which a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital New Delhi.

More recently, it emerged last week a 
14-year-old girl was dragged into a forest and raped on the orders of a 
village council in remote eastern India in retaliation for a sex assault
 blamed on her brother.

The attack took place after midnight on Sunday in a small village in Jharkhand state's Bokaro district.

Last month, two teenage girls were allegedly raped before they were found swinging from a mango tree in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

The new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised a zero tolerance approach on crimes against women, but violence and discrimination against women continue to plague India.
