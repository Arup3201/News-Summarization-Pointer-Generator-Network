Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde have posed in head-to-toe denim for a shoot to celebrate their new film Endless Love.

The models-turned-actors, who both hail from the UK, look sensational in V magazine's February issue – despite being clad in what is commonly known as a Canadian tuxedo.

The duo also discussed their new movie - a remake of the 1981 scorned love classic starring Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt.

According to Miss Wilde, 24, who is 
due to welcome her first child any day now, ‘there is a lot more going 
on in this movie than two kids falling in love. It’s a bit edgier.’

Mr Pettyfer, 23, added: ‘Our movie is a lot more lighthearted than the original, but still a beautiful love story.’

He explained that the film is successful in that ‘the problems…are simplistic, but so truthful – it’s about pure love.’

Eye candy: Like his co-star, Mr Pettyfer has starred in Burberry campaigns and has been rumored to date actresses including Emma Roberts, Dianna Agron, and Riley Keough

The actors have actually worked together before, in billboard campaigns for Burberry.

Since then, they have both broken into Hollywood. Mr Pettyfer appeared in 2012’s Magic Mike and 2013’s The Butler.  

His
 romantic life reflects the same success - he has been linked to 
actresses including Emma Roberts, Dianna Agron, and Riley Keough (whom 
he was rumored to be engaged).

Aristocratic beginnings: Ms Wilde is a descendant of the Gough-Calthorpe clan and is currently expecting her first child

Miss
 Wilde, who is engaged to Alan Pownall of the indie band Pale, has cut 
her teeth in a similar fashion with roles in 2011’s The Three Musketeers
 and last year’s high-grossing Carrie.

Her
half-sister, Isabella, is the wife of Richard Branson’s son Sam, and is a 
member of the dynastic Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe family.

Isabella and Prince Harry's current girlfriend Cressida Bonas have the same mother, Lady Mary Gaye Curzon.

Miss Wilde tells V that for her, the point of acting ‘is to discover new things and be challenged.

In the film: Ms Wilde and Mr Pettyfer play star-crossed lovers in a relationship that leads them down a bumpy path

‘Feeling really safe as an actor is not a great thing because you’re not learning or growing.’

Ms Wilde still feels it ‘easier to play darker roles.

‘To open yourself up and open your heart, it’s a scary thing in life, let alone a movie,’ she said.

The
 original followed Ms Sheilds’s bohemian teenage character through a 
romantic and sexual entanglement with her doomed, affluent lover played 
by Mr Hewitt.
