While Manchester City were getting beaten by Arsenal on the pitch, more than £100million worth of talent was watching from the stands.

Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Alvaro Negredo, Bacary Sagna, Sergio Aguero, Martin Demichelis and Frank Lampard were among those in the club's box.

Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini had refused to name any player that had made it past the group stages of the World Cup.

But the Chilean manager may well be looking forward to their return after his side's disappointing performance in the Community Shield final.

Box: Zabaleta, Kompany, Fernandinho, Negredo, Sagna, demichelis, Aguero and Lampard watch City lose

Old boy: Former Arsenal right-back Bacary Sagna watched his old side triumph in the Community Shield

An early goal from Santi Cazorla set the scene as he turned Gael Clichy and rifled the ball past Willy Caballero.

Aaron Ramsey scored a second after being set up by Yaya Sanogo before Olivier Giroud added a gloss with a dipping, long-range third.

The Premier League champions were uncharacteristically vulnerable at the back. Dedrick Boyata partnered Matija Nastasic in the centre while left-backs Gael Clichy and Aleksandar Kolarov played either side.

Pellegrini will know the result means little, but the return of City's remaining players can't come too soon.
