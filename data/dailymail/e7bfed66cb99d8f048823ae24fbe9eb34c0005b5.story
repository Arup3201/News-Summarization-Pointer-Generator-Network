When he became Pope, he said he wanted a 'poor church for the poor'.

And Pope Francis certainly seems to practise what he preaches, as his first official visit outside Rome has been to a Sicilian island to pray for migrants who have died trying to reach Italy to forge a better life for themselves.

Francis' choice of Lampedusa for his 
first official trip outside Rome is highly symbolic for the new pontiff,
who has placed the poor and dispossessed at the centre of his papacy 
and has urged the Church to return to its mission of serving them.

Pope Francis said cars are necessary to do a lot of work, but called for priests to 'choose a more humble one'

Pope Francis said that whenever priests felt a desire for an extravagant car, they should remember the starving and poor

His trip comes at the start of the 
summer months when for the past two decades the island has seen a steady
stream of migrant boats arriving on its shores.

And on arrival, he attacked what he calls 
the 'globalisation of indifference' that greets migrants who risk their 
lives trying to reach a better life in Europe.

Francis travelled to the tiny island 
of Lampedusa to meet with migrants who reached Italy from Africa and 
pray for those who died trying.

During a Mass on Lampedusa's main sports field, he lamented that we all 'have forgotten how to cry' for migrants lost at sea.

He also denounced smugglers who take 
advantage of migrants' poverty to get rich by transporting them to Italy
on overcrowded boats.

Francis, whose own ancestors 
immigrated to Argentina from Italy, travelled to the farthest reaches of
Italy to draw attention to the plight of migrants and the need to offer
them a life of dignity.

He laid a wreath in the port in memory of the thousands of migrants from Africa who have 
died trying to reach the tiny Sicilian island in unsafe and overcrowded 
boats.

Thousands of banner-waving islanders 
welcomed Francis at the port where he arrived aboard a coast guard 
vessel accompanied by a flotilla of fishing boats.

He spoke with some young African migrants in T-shirts before heading off to celebrate mass.

At the mass, in the field which served as a reception centre for thousands who fled 
Arab Spring unrest in North Africa in 2011, he used a wooden 
chalice carved out of the wood of a migrant boat by a local carpenter.

Christopher Hein, director of the 
Italian Council for Refugees, told the Catholic newspaper Avvenire the 
pope's visit was 'an extremely important gesture' that would help keep 
attention on the migrant issue.

Only 113 kilometres (70 miles) from 
Tunisia, Lampedusa, a sleepy island which normally lives off fishing and
tourism, has become one of the main points of entry into Europe for 
poor and desperate migrants willing to risk the crossing in overcrowded 
and unsafe fishing vessels and small boats.

Thousands are known to have died over the years and unknown numbers of others are presumed lost without trace.

The visit to Lampedusa is designed to
be sober in tone, in keeping with the pope's drive to get past the 
upheavals of recent years.

Since succeeding Pope Benedict in 
March, the former cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina has eschewed 
some of the more ostentatious trappings of his office.

On Saturday Pope Francis said it pained him to see priests driving flashy cars, and told them to pick something more 'humble'.

As part of his drive to make the 
Catholic Church more austere and focus on the poor, Francis told young 
and trainee priests and nuns from around the world that having the 
latest smartphone or fashion accessory was not the route to happiness.

'It hurts me when I see a priest or a nun with the latest model car, you can't do this," he said.

'A car is necessary to do a lot of work, but please, choose a more humble one.

'If you like the fancy one, just think about how many children are dying of hunger in the world,' he said.

His official car is a distinctly understated Ford Focus.

He caused a stir when he refused to wear opulent papal clothing choosing an iron cross instead of gold and elected to stick with his battered old black shoes instead of papal red.

He then refused to move into the vast papal apartments occupied by his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI.

Francis has opted to live instead in a simple residence for visiting priests, where he dines alongside church men from all over the world and gives a daily mass at which he has repeated his calls for 'a poor church'.

In June, he launched a stinging attack on the 'culture of waste' today and said throwing good food away is like stealing from the poor.

The pope made the comments during his weekly audience in St Peter's Square and criticised the culture of an increasingly consumerist world.

'Throwing away food is like stealing from the table of those who are poor and hungry.'

The comments were one of his many calls for greater social responsibility among the world's 1.2billion Roman Catholics.

The Argentinian-born pontiff warned that too much focus on money and materialism meant financial market dips were viewed as tragedies while human suffering had become normal and ignored.
