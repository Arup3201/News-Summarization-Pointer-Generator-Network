O.J. Simpson is receiving tests for brain cancer and is begging President Barack Obama for a pardon so he can die in peace at home, according to a new report.

The jailed former football legend, who is serving out a kidnapping, assault and robbery sentence in a Nevada prison, is undergoing secret medical exams for a cancerous tumor in his brain and is convinced he hasn't got long to live, The National Enquirer reports.

The publication reported just months ago that the 66-year-old had such an extreme case of diabetes that his life was at risk and brain cancer would certainly add to his health woes.

'O.J. says his memory is slipping and 
he gets painful headaches and other symptoms,' a source told The 
Enquirer, listing blurry vision, occasional stuttering and hearing 
problems as other concerns. He also at times feels confused and has unusual bursts of anger and fits of depression.

'He
 put off the doctors for weeks after he first started experiencing the 
symptoms because he was afraid of what they would find,' the source said.

'Now the prison docs 
are telling him they believe he has a brain tumor. They plan to run a 
series of tests on him, MRIs and CT scans.'

The
 Enquirer reports that Simpson has finally agreed to the tests and is 
convinced he hasn't got long to live, telling a friend, 'I feel the end 
coming. But I don't want to die in prison like common jailhouse scum.'

The publication reports he has even begged President Obama for a pardon so he can die comfortably at home.

Diabetes? The newspaper reported just months ago that the 66-year-old had such an extreme case of diabetes that his life was at risk

Before
 Simpson is eligible for parole, he has to serve another four year of 
his 33 year sentence at the Lovelock Correctional Center.

The
Enquirer reports Simpson tried to lose weight by sticking to a strict 
diet and exercise plan after a diabetes-related health scare a few 
months ago, but it was a struggle.

'He
 began suffering dizzy spells, nausea, lapses in memory and headaches - 
and the frightening symptoms continue to get worse,' the source is 
quoted as saying.

The article claims Simpson, in a last ditch attempt for freedom, wrote to the 
President and said 'Mr President, I know my life is coming to an end. 
Please, don't let me die in prison.'

In
 July, The Enquirer reported Simpson had just months to live as a result
 of his extreme case of diabetes and unhealthy lifestyle behind bars.

The
 combination of 'sky high' blood pressure, a vastly expanding waistline 
and a lack of physical activity had doctors concerned about his health, 
the magazine reported at the time.

Court: Simpson was convicted of a slew of charges on October 3, 2008 - the 13th anniversary of the day he was controversially acquitted of killing his ex-wife Nicole brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman

Simpson's lawyer Ozzie Fumo told MailOnline that he has not heard anything about his clients poor health.

'As
 far as I know his health is very good, he was doing just fine,' Fumo
 said. 'I spent a lot of time with him preparing for the retrial motion 
and he never once mentioned diabetes.

'We discussed health issues, we had meals together, and he seemed fine.'

The
 first warning signs came during a court hearing in May when the former 
running-back looked much heavier than he ever had before.

In
 the July story, The Enquirer claimed Simpson weighed 300 pounds and 
prison doctors encouraged him to exercise and eat more healthily to 
combat the high blood pressure and diabetes.

He had developed a habit of 
passing the days by laying in bed in his prison cell and only getting up
 to get sugar-filled snacks, it reported.

'OJ's
 doctors have told him he could be dead in as little as three months 
because of his out-of-control blood sugar and blood pressure,' an 
unidentified prison friend told The Enquirer in the summer.

'But OJ doesn't care. He knows he's never going to get out of prison, so he refuses to take care of himself.'

The 33-years he faces following a 2008 robbery are not helping motivate Simpson, as he is now making plans for his death.

He
 allegedly confessed to murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her 
friend Ron Goldman in 1994 and told a prison friend that he will write a
 confession letter that will be sent- and then publicly shared- after he
 dies.

Fumo countered this claim, saying that in his months of interactions with Simpson he has 'never once disparaged the Goldmans'.

'In his mind, they're creditors along with his children Sydney and Justin,' Fumo said.

The
 friends cited by The Enquirer said the double slaying came in a moment 
of rage that he regrets to this day because he still loves Nicole.
