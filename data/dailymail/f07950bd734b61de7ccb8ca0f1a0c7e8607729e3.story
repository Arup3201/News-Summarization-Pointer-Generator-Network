Rio Ferdinand thinks Robin van Persie went from being adored under Sir Alex Ferguson to unloved by David Moyes at Manchester United.

Ferdinand, an ex-United defender, was asked about Van Persie's below par season at Old Trafford, and admitted the new boss did little to invigorate the striker in the same way as his predecessor.

'When Sir Alex Ferguson left, he went from being the star man, our go-to guy, the top scorer, to being almost like a sideshow,' said Ferdinand.

'I think that the dynamics changed.

'The manager, David Moyes, was talking up Wayne Rooney and forwards need to be loved.

'And I don't think he felt that love last season.'

Ferdinand is acting as a pundit alongside Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry and Gary Lineker in the BBC studios in Brazil.

Van Persie is captaining the Netherlands during their World Cup opener against Spain in Group B, and is doing so under manager Louis van Gaal.

His headed goal was followed by a celebration with his national manager, where Van Persie ran towards Van Gaal, prompting Henry to say: 'If you have a boss that loves you, look at this.'

Van Gaal will follow his Dutch forward back to Manchester once the tournament is finished, after being named new United boss following the sacking of Moyes.Â
