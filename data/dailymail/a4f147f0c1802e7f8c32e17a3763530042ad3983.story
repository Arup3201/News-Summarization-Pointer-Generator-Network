David Cameron and Nick Clegg held ‘tense’ face-to-face talks yesterday as the Liberal Democrats prompted further Tory anger with a bizarre claim that they knew nothing about a key plank of Government education policy.

The Prime Minister and his Lib Dem deputy had a private lunch meeting at which Mr Cameron expressed serious concern about a Lib Dem attack on free schools over the weekend.

The Deputy Prime Minister is understood to have stood his ground, insisting his U-turn was about wanting ‘better standards for parents’.

Mr Clegg is expected to use a speech later this week to confirm he will no longer support some of the fundamental principles of free schools, which have been set up by businesses, charities, religious organisations and groups of parents free from council control.

The Deputy Prime Minister says he no longer supports some of the most important freedoms exercised by free school heads, including their power to set their own curriculum and hire teachers without union-recognised qualifications.

Business Secretary Vince Cable fuelled the row last night by claiming the Lib Dems had not voted in favour of allowing free schools – like private schools – to hire whoever they like.

‘I think we want to make sure, as Liberal Democrats, that the free schools are properly supported by trained teachers and that's where we've parted company to some extent with the Secretary of State [Michael Gove],’ Mr Cable told ITV News.

‘The original idea which we voted for at the beginning of this Parliament, the assumption was that there would be properly qualified teachers and that seems to have changed.’

The remarks drew a scathing response 
from senior Tories, who pointed out that Lib Dem peers had voted with 
the Government in the House of Lords to kill off a Labour attempt to 
prevent free schools having an open hiring policy.

'It's
typical of Vince Cable and Nick Clegg that they now claim they never 
knew about something that they actually voted for - no wonder people 
hate MPs for lying all the time,’ said one Government source.

'Nick Clegg's rich parents sent him to a brilliant private school that doesn't rely only on government certified teachers but he now says he wants to deny that flexibility for state schools.

‘It's typical of Clegg's hypocrisy and dishonesty. He's happy for rich people to keep going to schools where the heads make hiring and firing decisions but he won't let everybody else do the same.’

Even some of Mr Clegg’s allies expressed private unease about the party’s confusing position.

A Lib Dem source said Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron had had an ‘open and polite’ discussion in which the Deputy Prime Minister ‘made clear he supported free schools but wanted better standards for parents’.

Another source said the Deputy Prime 
Minister had ‘ranted’ at Mr Cameron about remarks from a Government 
source attacking him for ‘cheap sanctimony’ in yesterday’s Daily Mail.

Asked about his comments on free schools on ITV's The Agenda programme last night, Mr Clegg said: 'I personally - maybe I didn't explain it well enough - don't find it complicated to say look, we're moving towards a world in our school system where there are more academies more free schools, where schools for the first time in a generation have much more freedom and autonomy to set their rules what they do every day and so on...

'We need to decide in years ahead what that means for things like standards. So what I'm saying is as a Liberal Democrat, I actually am in support of our push to give schools more freedom but in future I also want to make sure we give parents the reassurance that standards are met. I don't find that very complicated.

'You have to move with the times - we're moving towards a different way of running our schools. Give them more freedom but give parents the reassurance that they're going to be taught by qualified teachers.'

A Tory source said: 'We're surprised the contents of a private meeting have been briefed to the press. The Liberals seem a bit rattled by the confusion over their free schools policy.'

Labour’s shadow education minister Kevin Brennan said: ‘Nick Clegg is locked into this failure too. He ordered his party through the lobbies in favour of unqualified teachers and his schools minister, David Laws, said he was 100 per cent behind the policy in Parliament last week. This is just more proof that you can't trust a word the Lib Dems say.’

Graham Stuart, chairman of the education select committee, accused the Deputy Prime Minister of making a ‘strangely illiberal policy announcement’ and compared him to the late left-wing Labour Cabinet minister Barbara Castle.

‘My understanding is the a typical liberal view would be believing that you trust the front line to decide who should teach but you hold them strongly to account through exam results and through Ofsted,’ Mr Stuart said.

‘I thought they believed in localism and yet here we are, at the first sign of trouble and Nick Clegg comes over all Barbara Castle. It’s a very peculiar approach and it’s already leading to splits in the Lib Dems.’

Mr Stuart said that Mr Clegg’s comments left David Laws, the Lib Dem education minister who backed free schools, including ‘superb’ teachers without formal qualifications, in the Commons last week in a ‘difficult position’.

Baroness Buscombe, a Conservative peer, said the Deputy Prime Minister was being ‘two-faced’ and hypocritical since he was almost certainly taught by ‘brilliant’ unqualified teachers as a child at the expensive private Westminster School.

Education minister Liz Truss said there would be no change to Government policy, despite Mr Clegg’s objections.

‘I think it is important that they have freedom over teaching and over the curriculum. I think that is what is making them successful,’ she said.

‘I am slightly surprised to hear what Nick Clegg has to say, because on Thursday David Laws made an impassioned speech in favour of free schools having these freedoms.

‘So there seems to be a bit of confusion about their policy but we are very clear that the government policy is that free schools should have that freedom.

‘The proposals went through on free schools with Liberal Democrat support.’
