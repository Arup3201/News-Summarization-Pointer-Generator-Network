A new app, dubbed Good2Go, allows users to give 'affirmative consent' prior to sexual activity

Nowadays, there is an app for just about everything - including consensual sex.

A new app, dubbed Good2Go, allows users to give 'affirmative consent' prior to sexual activity.

But to do so, they must tell the app a) who they are sleeping with, b) when they are doing it and c) how drunk or sober they are. 

They are then advised as to whether they can consent to sex.

Lee Ann Allman created the app, which is free on iTunes and Google Play to over 18s, after speaking to her teenage children about sexual assault on American college campuses.

She told Slate Magazine that students 'are very aware of what's happening, and they're worried about it, but they're confused about what to do.'

She added: 'They don't know how they should be approaching somebody they're interested in.'

Ms Allman, who also runs Sandton Technologies, hopes her technology will help facilitate necessary conversations between sexual partners and encourage them to reflect on their sobriety.

To use Good2Go, users must launch the app, before handing the phone to their potential partner.

Using a euphemism for sex, the app then asks the person: 'Are we Good2Go?', before offering them three choices: 'No, thanks', 'Yes, but... we need to talk', and 'I'm Good2Go'. 

If the individual chooses 'No, thanks', a black screen pops up reading: 'Remember! No means No! Only Yes means Yes. BUT can be changed to NO at anytime!.'

Meanwhile, the 'Yes, but... we need to talk' option leads to a pause, during which the couple are given time to discuss their mutual interest in sex.

The final choice, 'I'm Good2Go', sends the user to a second screen, which asks them how intoxicated they are: a) 'Sober', b) 'Mildly Intoxicated', c) 'Intoxicated but Good2Go' or d) 'Pretty Wasted'.

If the individual picks 'Pretty Wasted', they are then informed that they 'cannot consent' to sexual activity and are instructed to hand the phone back to their potential partner.

The final choice, 'I'm Good2Go', sends the user to a second screen, which asks them how intoxicated they are: a) 'Sober', b) 'Mildly Intoxicated', c) 'Intoxicated but Good2Go' or d) 'Pretty Wasted'

Before sex, all users are required to tell the app if they are an existing Good2Go user, before typing in their phone number and password.

If are a new user, they are asked to enter their phone number, a password, confirm they are 18 and press 'submit'. 

They are then required to input a six-digit code that has been sent to their own mobile phone to verify their identify. 

Finally, the person is told to hand the phone back to its owner, who can then view their partner's level of consent (such as, partner is mildly intoxicated, but is Good2Go). 

In accordance with its privacy policy, Good2Go can share users' information, including their name and phone number, with law enforcement, 'third-party service providers' and email marketers

'To be clear, it is not our policy to disclose these records to just anyone,' Ms Allman told the Washington Post.

Two days ago, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law requiring all state colleges to adopt a policy of unambiguous, affirmative consent by students engaged in sexual activity.

The so-called 'yes means yes' law will be the first in the nation to make affirmative consent language a central tenet of school sexual assault policies, proponents said.

The legislation, passed by the California State Senate last month as part of a nationwide effort to curb sexual assaults on U.S. campuses, defines consent as 'an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.'

It also states that silence and a lack of resistance do not signify consent and that drugs or alcohol do not excuse unwanted sexual activity.

The White House has declared sex crimes to be 'epidemic' on U.S. college campuses, with one in five students falling victim to sex assault during their college years.
