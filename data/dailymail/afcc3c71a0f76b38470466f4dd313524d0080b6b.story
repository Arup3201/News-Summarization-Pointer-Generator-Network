Gone in an instant, two familes were devastated Thursday by deadly storms that swept through northern Indiana.

Angelo Santucci, 28, and Jackie Allen, 42, both died after lightning strikes in Gary, IN. A nine-month-old baby somehow survived the same lightning strike that killed Mr Allen.

The married father was wearing a metal harness when the bolt struck him on the platform of the billboard, his sister Destiny Santucci told CBS Chicago.

‘It struck him, and they said it stopped his heart,’ she told the station. ‘By the time they got up there, the doctors told us there’s only a window of time before they have to resuscitate him.’

‘Heavy rain, low visibility, and lots of thunder,’ the fire department spokesperson said, ‘it hindered the rescue operation.’

Once able to get inside, rescuers were able to get both Mr Allen and the baby out of the house, but were only able to revive the baby.

‘They was trying to do CPR, trying to bring them back, it didn’t work, the neighbor added.

Locals couldn’t believe the storm turned their neighbor’s house into a charred shell, taking his life.‘I was just in shock, like wow, like, it really did that damage?’ Another neighbor asked.
