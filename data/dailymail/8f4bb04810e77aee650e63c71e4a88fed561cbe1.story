Constance Briscoe, pictured is currently serving a 16-month jail term and is now facing a further police probe

A disgraced judge and best-selling author is facing fresh claims that she forged documentation to influence the outcome of a trial when her mother claimed libel against her, it can be revealed.

Constance Briscoe, 56, is alleged to have created and signed a witness statement from a family friend to support claims she was abused by her mother and stepfather.

Last night, the man whose signature is on the statement said: ‘I never made that statement or said those things.’

The Metropolitan Police have said the document will form part of an ongoing inquiry.

A spokesman said the information ‘would be looked at and assessed accordingly.’ The revelation comes as Briscoe’s mother, who said the disputed statement was submitted to court, vowed to write her own book after being branded a child-beater in her daughter’s bestselling memoir Ugly, published in 2006.

She added she would still like to visit her once high-flying daughter in jail.

Briscoe, a mother-of-two who has just begun a 16-month jail term for covering up her role in the case of Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne and his former wife Vicky Pryce, made the abuse claims in her bestseller, which sold 500,000 copies worldwide.

She and the book’s publishers, Hodder & Stoughton, won the 2008 libel case brought against her by her mother, Carmen Briscoe-Mitchell, who  was left penniless after spending some £200,000 in legal costs. Last night Mrs Briscoe-Mitchell said: ‘She made the statement up, along with all the things in the book. I have been saying this for years but only now are people listening.’
