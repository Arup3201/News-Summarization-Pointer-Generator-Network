More than 100 staff at a bank that employs Tony Blair as an adviser were each paid an average salary package of more than £2million in 2012.

Documents disclosed by JP Morgan to European regulators show that 126 of the US bank’s London-based employees were paid £41million in salaries and a further £222million in bonuses.

The 2012 average was a slight fall from the £2.2million average seen in 2011, but it will spark new concerns over fat-cat pay.

Earlier this week, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said foreign-owned banks in the City were ‘in denial’ over the financial crisis, while Goldman Sachs said 115 of its executives pocketed £3million each in 2012 – up 50 per cent on 2011.

Despite the fall, the scale of the hand-outs will infuriate campaigners who believe not enough is being done to bring bankers pay into line.

The Archbishop has said many bankers did not understand how the industry’s culture of high risk and reckless pursuit of profit had brought the global economy to its knees.

Mr Blair, who would not be among the 126 top bankers because he is a part-time consultant, was hired in 2008 by JP Morgan.

He earns around £2million a year in his role as adviser to the Wall Street bank.

Banks have been forced to provide greater transparency on pay due to tighter regulations from the EU aimed at reducing eye-watering rewards.

New rules limiting what banks in the European Union can pay in bonuses came into force yesterday.

Banks will be banned from paying bonuses worth more than a banker’s annual salary, or twice as much as their pay if sanctioned by shareholders.

But most banks are expected to raise basic pay in order to offset the decline.

Yesterday it also emerged that Ross McEwan, chief executive of state-backed RBS was handed £1.5million in free shares on December 31, as compensation for missing out on bonuses at his previous job.
