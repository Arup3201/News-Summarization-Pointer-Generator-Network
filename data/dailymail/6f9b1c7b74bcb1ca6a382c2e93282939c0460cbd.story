A father (not pictured) has admitted to raping his two-month-old son at the start of a trial which prosecutors have described as one of the most 'serious abuse cases in Norwegian legal history'

A 32-year-old man raped his two-month-old son and sent footage of the attack to a paedophile ring, a trial in Norway has heard.

The father admitted the offences yesterday at the start of what the prosecutor described as one of the most 'serious abuse cases in Norwegian legal history'.

He has been charged with two other men and two women with their involvement in a paedophile network which filmed their own children in sexual positions or acts.

District Attorney Kristin Røhne said: 'The people involved had a sexual interest in very young children.' 

The court in Drammen was told police began tracking the paedophile ring last year after finding sickening footage of the rape on the computer of a suspected child abuser.

Mr Røhne said in a prosecution statement: 'We knew nothing about this child, but on the video we could hear the sound of voices from Norwegian radio or television in the background.'

The video was traced to a 34-year-old man who was allegedly sent the footage by the 32-year-old father, it was reported by The Local which cited a report by Norway's Aftenposten newspaper.

The 34-year-old is said to have previously been convicted of sexually assaulting a minor and distributing videos of child abuse in 2009.

The two men have appeared in court alongside a 27-year-old man and two women aged 27 and 43.

They have all been charged with involvement in a paedophile network which filmed their own children in sexual positions or acts. 

The three men have also been charged with raping the 27-year-old woman's two-month-old baby.

A lawyer for the 32-year-old man told the court: 'My client has chosen to confess to all charges and lay all his cards on the table.'

The trial continues.
