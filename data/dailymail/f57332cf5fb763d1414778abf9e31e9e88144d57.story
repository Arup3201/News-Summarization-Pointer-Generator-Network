A group of playful otters are showing off their circus skills and keeping zoo visitors entertained with their ability to juggle.Â 

The playful creatures lie on their backs and toss small stones between their paws much to the amusement of the crowds.

Asian short-clawed otters eat a slippery diet of fish and shellfish, which they prefer to consume while floating on their backs using their tummies as a table.

The otters enjoy a spacious enclosure 
at Dudley Zoological Garden near Birmingham, in conditions as near as 
possible to their natural habitat of Philippine mangrove swamps.

Jill Hitchman, zoo spokesman, said:
'The otters lie on their backs when they are in a juggling mood and 
pick up little pebbles, which they put on their tummies and roll around.

'They then juggle the pebbles from paw to paw.'

Asian short-clawed otters are the smallest species of otter in the world, and weigh only 5kg.

They are often tamed and used as pest control to rid rice paddies of crabs.

They can live for up to 16 years and stay faithful to their mate for life.

Otters have
many quirky habits, including banging rocks against clams and on their 
tummies to crack shells.

At night, sea otters hold hands with their mate while they sleep to stop them floating apart.
