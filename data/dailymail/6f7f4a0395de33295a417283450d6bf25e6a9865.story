86-year-old John Bushell called his next door neighbours' home in South Tyneside a 'midden', a 14th century insult meaning dung heap, in a feud that dates back 40 years

He has already been jailed for his anti-social behaviour and last year was forced to wear an electronic tag to ensure he kept the peace.

But that didn’t stop 86-year-old John Bushell launching yet another torrent of abuse at his long-suffering neighbours.

The retired book-keeper was sweeping his drive when he accused Kenneth and Marjorie Mills of living in a ‘midden’ – a 14th century word for a manure dump.

Of Scandinavian origin, the term is still in use in Scotland and the North of England where it refers to anything that is a mess.

Bushell also called his 66-year-old neighbours – who were filming him with a camcorder – ‘scumbags’.

His actions resulted in him breaking the restraining order the couple had taken out against him.

Bushell was first handed an order in 1998 which banned him from contacting the couple.

Tensions have grown during the five decades they have lived next-door to each other in a cul-de-sac in Hebburn, South Tyneside.

He has breached the order eight times, resulting in a further three convictions and was jailed in 2001 and tagged last year.

The court at the time of the jail 
sentence heard how Bushell plagued the lives of families he thought did 
not keep their homes up to scratch.

He has now been found guilty of breaching the order again after he hurled abuse at his neighbours on May 7.

South Tyneside magistrates deferred his sentence for six months.

Bushell admitted shouting at Mr and Mrs Mills, but said he had been provoked by them filming him.

In his defence, he said: ‘They are plaguing my life with the camera. I was just out trying to make my place look nice.

Marjorie Mills and husband Kenneth have been victims of a 40 year campaign of harassment by neighbour John Bushell, which saw him jailed in 2001 and electronically tagged last year

‘She came out and said she had me locked up before and would  do again.

‘She said we were snobs and no one liked us and we should just leave. I called them scumbags in response to that.’

After seeing a video of the rant and 
hearing from other neighbours who watched the exchange, magistrates 
found he had no excuse for the insults he directed at the couple.

Chairwoman of the bench Patricia Morris said: 'We believe it has been proved that you breached the order.

South Tyneside magistrates watched a video of Bushell's rant and found he had no excuse

'And we are satisfied that evidence we heard from Mr and Mrs Mills and the other neighbours was credible.

'We
do not accept you had reasonable grounds to breach the order and 
therefore find the case proved beyond all reasonable doubt."

Instead
of sentencing Bushell straight away, the magistrates deferred the 
sentence for six months and he will be back at the court on May 1.

Mrs Morris added: 'During that time, we expect you to keep away from your neighbours.'

Speaking after Bushell’s latest conviction, Mr and Mrs Mills said they wanted to call an end to their feud.

The couple said they had lived  in 
fear of their neighbour since moving into their home in 1970. Mrs Mills 
said: ‘All we want to do is to be able to enjoy our lives in peace.

'We have been here before.

'He has been to jail and had a curfew and been warned by judges about his behaviour, but it hasn't stopped him.'

The couple say they have lived in fear of their neighbour since moving into their home in Mill Crescent, Hebburn, in 1970.

A 'midden' is a Middle English term deriving from the Scandinavian word 'mykdyngja' which literally translates as 'manure pile'.

The term 'midden' is commonly used by
archaeologists to describe any kind of feature containing waste 
products relating to day-to-day human life.

The East Chisenbury midden, on Salisbury Plain,
is a famous example of a large dump.The midden mound contains numerous discrete layers of flint, charcoal, 
bones, pottery and excrement.

The couple have tried to sell their 
£200,000 home three times, but the buyers have pulled out each time 
after hearing about Bushell.

Bushell also claims to have tried to sell his home but neither family have managed to move.

Mrs Mill added: 'No one wants to live next to a man like him. He would have a better chance of selling the house.

'There
have been sale signs up twice but I don't think he will move really. I 
don't mind him living there, as long as he keeps out of our way.

'He can sweep his yard, walk past our house and do whatever he likes - as long as it doesn't involve us.

'We don't bother him, so why should he bother us.

'He said we shouldn't film him but I only do that when he starts harassing us, mit is the only way to prove what he is like.'

Bushell,
who lives with wife Sonia in the cul-de-sac, said he has listened to 
the magistrates and will do his best to keep the peace.

Speaking after the case, he said: 'I have got to accept the court's decision and do as they say.

'I will keep myself to myself and keep out of their way.'
