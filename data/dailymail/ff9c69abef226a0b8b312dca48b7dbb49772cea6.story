An ex-gang member who was expelled from school for attempting to kill a fellow pupil has spoken out about the dangers of teen violence and warned that parents need to start taking more responsibility for their children's behaviour. 

Tracey Miller, 36, spent much of her teens  living a life of crime on the streets of south London, where she grew up and still lives.

But several years ago, the mother-of-two got her life back on track and started to work as a mentor for other troubled youths. 

She went on to co-write a play about the issue and has now released a memoir going into detail about her life of crime in an attempt to deters others from following suit, appearing on This Morning today to tell her story and explaining how easy it is to end up in a gang.

Tracey's destructive attitude started early on, when she was expelled from her senior school after attempting to stab another girl in her class.

She was 13 years old and living with her manic-depressive mother three siblings in West Norwood, while her father was facing life in prison. 

She said: 'The first time I picked up a knife there was a character at home and he was a paedophile.

'I was too scared to tell my mum as she's a manic depressive and she might have killed him. 

'Seeing as my dad was incarcerated, there would have been no one else to look after me if I had told her and she had tried to kill him. 

'One day I overheard that this man had touched another family member, so I took a knife and put it under my pillow at night.' 

So the knife was already in her possession when an incident happened with a friend at school that caused tempers to flare. 

She said: 'People don't understand that when you have a parent who's a manic depressive, it can be quite embarrassing.

'I had taken a friend home and my mum went through a manic episode while she was there. 

'This girl went back to school and told everyone and I thought, 'I want to kill her.'

'So I took the knife to school with me and tried to stab her, but the people in my class stopped me, they all jumped on me.

'After that I was expelled.'

'The next school I was sent to was a tough school - it has closed down now.

'They'd already heard of me there because of the knife incident, so I thought I'd carry on with with this reputation.

I never intentionally set out to be that character but once I had people at school that took my lead I carried on with it - I got an adrenaline rush from it.' 

'It goes to show that children are a by-product of their environment and parents need to be aware of that and take it seriously.'

Tracey's behaviour went downhill fast at her new school, she became involved in a gang that would regularly rob local businesses like off licences and even ice cream vans. 

The situation got so unsafe that she ended up sleeping next to a hand gun every night for protection. 

But as dangerous as their crimes were, Tracey maintains that gang life nowadays is far more out-of-control.

She said: 'The guys I got together with, we targeted businesses.

'A situation like a lady going home from work, doing something like putting a knife against her through and mugging her - hell no, we had morals.

'My generation of gangs set the trend for 'licking it.' 

'We'd go into a business, try and get the cash and then get out as quick as we could with no violence.

'Now kids have taken it to a whole new level - with initiations.' 

The final straw came when she was shot with a sawn-off shotgun during the Brixton Riots in 1995. 

She said: 'It was the Brixton riots, they were looting the area I was standing in and as we were running, a guy turned and opened fire. 

'He had a sawn-off shotgun and it was like the sky just lit up.

'I rolled under a car but it was too late - I'd been shot.

Tracey revisits the place where she was shot during the Brixton Riots in 1981 

'When the crowd dispersed I got up and started to walk away and that's when the pain hit me - it felt like my leg had been torn off and I just collapsed.

'I've still till got ball-bearings lodged in my body.

'The effects of that combined with me getting into a relationship with a man led to me eventually taking an overdose and just losing the momentum for being naughty, that was the change.'

Tracey also fell pregnant, prompting her to turn her life around completely. 

She has spent several years now mentoring troubled young people in various areas of London and also visits Young Offenders Unit in her role. 

This week she has brought out a her memoirs, called Sour, in a an effort to try and use her story to prevent other people following a similar path. 

She said: 'There's two ways of looking at it - if I hadn't done that then I couldn't mentor the people that I do now, but equally I could have done something better with my life like be a brain surgeon maybe. 

'I'd rather I hadn't done what I did, but it is what it is. 

'I don't want sympathy, this is just a story that I felt needed to be told.

'This is to convince other youngsters to come out and tell their story, or to convince them to change their paths.

'People need to be told that there are no grey areas in life, it's black or white - you know what's right or wrong.  

'As for parents - they are your children. So if your kids are coming back with stuff that you know you haven't given them, inspect their rooms, look through their phones, connect with them.'
