The final countdown to the 2012 Olympic Games began today with amazing images of the capital as torchbearer Amelia Hempleman-Adams carried the flame on the London Eye.

The 17-year-old - the youngest person to ski to the South Pole - stood smiling in a specially-built cage on top of one of the capsules hundreds of feet above ground as she held the torch aloft.

She was taking part in the latest leg of the UK torch relay with five days to go before it arrives at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London on Friday for the opening Games ceremony.

As the torch toured the boroughs of Redbridge, Barking and Dagenham and Havering and Bexley, London mayor Boris Johnson promised a 'gigantic schmoozathon' that would shine a spotlight on British.business.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'I think possibly what we are going through at the moment as a nation, as a city, is that necessary pre-curtain up moment of psychological self-depression before the excitement begins on Friday.

'It is only natural that people should be tense, that they should be expectant and there are loads of things we need to get right.'

Mr Johnson claimed that International Olympics Committee president Jacques Rogge believes London has met the standards set by other hosts. He said: 'If you look at what Jacques Rogge had to say - he's been in London for a few days - he thinks that our city is as well prepared as any city in the history of the Games.'

Mr Johnson dismissed the threat of strike action by UK Border Agency staff, claiming most workers would want to 'get behind' the Games by turning up to work.

He said: 'I don't think that whatever they do it will disrupt the Olympics or our preparations or disrupt our ability to get people through and in on time to their venues, get the athletes, the Olympics hierarchs, through to where they need to go.

'I do think if you look at the numbers who voted it is a very, very badly supported strike. I don't think people will want to let down the Olympics.'

Amelia, who carried out her record-breaking expedition with her father David, a renowned adventurer, last December, described holding the torch above the capital as a 'once in a lifetime' opportunity.

The stunt was suggested to the teenager, who told the BBC: 'I decided to see what I'd have to do, thought about it and decided to do it.It was amazing to look out and see the whole of London.'

Amelia, who has tickets for the 
athletics and diving events, added: 'The height was quite scary but you 
know you're safe so it's not too bad. It was a once in a lifetime 
experience, especially as the Olympics are in London. It makes it more 
special.'

Former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis,  the London-born boxer who won Olympic gold for Canada in Seoul in 1988, will be the last torchbearer today.

The first leg
started at Redbridge Cycling Centre with Luke Benjafield, 20, from South
Woodford, carrying the flame through a corridor of cyclists from local 
clubs.

He was nominated for the role due to his dedication to the Air Training Corps 241 Squadron, where he has inspired and motivated many cadets to succeed in their flight training.

It was then taken by boat across Fairlop Lake by sailors from the London Youth 
Games. Britain's Got Talent-winning dance troupe Diversity will carry the flame in Barking and 
Dagenham.

Next stop is 
Havering where Chinese concert pianist Lang Lang will take the flame on 
to a stage outside the Queen's Theatre in Hornchurch.

Olympic rower Ben Hunt-Davies, who won
gold in Sydney in 2000, will also be a torchbearer. A London Fire 
Brigade fireboat will transport the torch across the River Thames.

It
will then be taken to Danson Park in Bexley where pop duo Rizzle Kicks 
and dance act Twist And Pulse will perform in the evening's 
celebrations.

Last night, the Millenium Bridge, Tower Bridge and London Bridge were lit up in blue orange and pink as part of the cultural celebrations for the 2012 Olympics.

Yesterday celebrities carried the torch through the boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Hackney. They includes Dizzee Rascal, Paloma Faith and footballer Fabrice Muamba who is recovering from an on-pitch heart attack  while playing for Bolton.
