The Italian Senate has expelled three-time ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi from Parliament over his tax fraud conviction. 

The move halts the 77-year-old Berlusconi's legislative run for at least six years, but does not mark the end of his political career. 

Berlusconi maintained his defiance ahead of the vote, declaring today as a 'day of mourning for democracy' before thousands of cheering, flag-waving supporters outside his Roman palazzo.

Even though Berlusconi won't hold a seat in Parliament, he is expected to remain influential in Italian politics.

He has relaunched his Forza Italia party and analysts estimate he still commands millions of supporters.

The Senate speaker declared he was ineligible for a seat in parliament after the house rejected a series of challenges by Berlusconi's supporters to a proposal for his expulsion. No formal vote was held.

Berlusconi was sentenced in August to four years in prison, commuted to a year under house arrest or in community service, for masterminding an illegal scheme to reduce the tax bill of his media company Mediaset.

The ex-politician, who was also found guilty of having sex with an underage prostitute at his infamous bunga bunga parties.

He was sentenced to seven years in jail for that offence and for abuse of office for trying to cover up the crime, but he still has two levels of appeal before the conviction and eventual punishment is confirmed.

New documents released to a Milan court this week show that prosecutors were satisfied that Berlusconi had sex with Karima El Mahroug knowing she was underage - a consensus which led to his conviction in for using underage prostitutes earlier this year.

In an explosive document it was revealed that the court found 'it is proved that the defendant had sexual relations with Miss El Mahroug - known as Ruby the Heartstealer -  in exchange for considerable sums of money and other items such as jewellery.'

Judges also concluded that the disgraced politician was the director of bunga bunga parties where female guests ' worked to satisfy the desires of the defendant... staging lap dances and stripteases'.

The case involving Miss El Mahroug is just the latest in a long line of scandals that has seen the 77-year-old former leader rarely out of the Italian courts in the last few years.

In August the disgraced politician lost his final appeal over a fraud conviction which handed him a four-year jail term.

Shockingly Italian polls repeatedly show that many would still vote for him despite his outragous personal life.

Despite losing his appeal the media tycoon is unlikely to see the inside of a jail any time soon.

His four year sentence has already been reduced to one year - under an amnesty for crimes committed before 2006 -  because of his age and he has opted for the cushier choice of 12 months' community service.

This means that although he will have to join other convicts in carrying out menial tasks, such as cutting the grass in public parks, painting sheltered accommodation or picking up litter he will not be punished with any form or imprisonment or even house arrest.

Berlusconi was famously divorced in 2009 by ex-wife Veronica Lario after she saw him photographed at an underwear model's 18th birthday party.

At the time she said she could no longer stay with someone who spent time with 'minors' and pointed out that he had never turned up to any of his own children's 18th birthday parties.

Earlier in the year the billionaire had been forced to take out full-page adverts in the newspapers to apologise to her for telling another woman - a guest at a TV awards dinner - that he wanted to marry her instead.

Berlusconi was married to Miss Lario for the best part of 20 years and has three children with her - Barbara, 29, Eleonora, 27, and Luigi, 25.

He was previously married to Carla Elvira Dell’Oglio with whom he had his first two children Marina, 47, and Pier Silvio, 44.

Last month he reportedly married his fiancée in a secret wedding at his private chapel.

The three-time Italian premier, who is nearly 50 years older than his bride, wed former TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 28, at a church inside his palatial villa near Milan in early October.

The couple, who met when Miss Pascale was a teenage activist in Berlusconi's his Forza Italia party, wed despite a string of allegations that their relationship is ‘a sham’.
