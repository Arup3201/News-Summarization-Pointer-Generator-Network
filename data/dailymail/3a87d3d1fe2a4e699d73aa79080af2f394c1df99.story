A Texas man was sentenced to 45 years Monday for strangling his wife while they argued over indecency charges for sexual contact with a child.

Epifanio Guzman, 43, told jurors that he only realized he'd killed her after waking up the next morning beside her corpse, blood pooling in her mouth, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reports.

Guzman and his wife Rachel Rodriguez, 41, were arguing after a party over an indecency charge that Guzman was facing for allegedly touching a 7-year-old relative's genitals over her clothing.

Strangling: Epifanio Guzman, 43, was sentenced to 45 years with the possibility of parole Monday for strangling his wife while they argued over an indecency charge for sexual contact with a child

He said he began choking her from behind, only loosening his grasp when his wife's body went limp, before laying her into bed and falling asleep next to her.

After discovering her dead in the morning, Guzman wrapped the body in a red sleeping bag and drove from their home in Lubbock, dumping her body in a secluded area along the way.

His destination was Big Spring, where his mother lived with her husband, Alvino Gutierrez, whom Guzman says he wanted to kill but couldn't find the opportunity.

Family members said that the couple knew each other from childhood, but when her mother married an uncle of Guzman's, she put a stop to a burgeoning romance.

After being apart for 27 years, they reconnected at a family reunion and later married. Rodriguez stayed by Guzman's side through tough times, and had even posted bail after he was picked up on theft charges three days before he killed her.

After dumping the body, Guzman stayed in Big Spring, visiting his niece, Juanita Rodriguez, at work, who asked him about scratches on his face and body.

Deceased: Family members of Rachel Rodriguez, 41, were enraged that the dumping of her body had led to it decomposing, which meant they had to have a closed-casket burial

She said he told her he had left his wife because she repeatedly attacked him, and that he believed she had been unfaithful.

The Tuesday after the killing, Rodriguez's brother, Daniel Arispe, who had been living with the couple, phoned a cousin who said Guzman had turned up at her apartment with a cut over his eye.

At that time, Rodriguez's employer, Covenant Medical Center Advising, had become concerned after she had failed to show up for work, and the family called police.

Police found the body Wednesday in the remote area where it had been dumped, arresting Guzman in Big Spring later that day on a warrant for indecency with a child.

Guzman pleaded guilty on Monday to the charge of murder on Monday as part of an arrangement that saw the indecency charge dropped.

In court, one of Rodriguez's sons, Israel Ledesma faced Guzman and told him that his marriage to his mother had been nothing but a lie. 

'I hope you do' find peace, Ledesma said. 'I hope it’s slow.'
