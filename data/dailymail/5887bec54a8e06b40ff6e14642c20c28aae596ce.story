ARRESTED: Trey Foster was taken into custody for his suspected role in a shooting at a Houston college on Tuesday

A man suspected in an argument that exploded into gunfire at a Houston-area college was arrested Friday some 250 miles away in a Dallas suburb, authorities said.

Trey Foster, 22, was taken into custody in Plano and has been returned to Houston for questioning, Harris County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Christina Garza said.

Foster arrived at daybreak, handcuffed and shackled at the ankles, and was led into the sheriff's office by deputies.

Officials said at least 10 shots were fired in the incident Tuesday at the Lone Star College campus in north Houston. Three men were wounded, including a maintenance worker who was caught in the crossfire.

According to court documents, an argument broke out after 25-year-old Jody Neal bumped into Foster on campus.

About 30 minutes later, Foster and his friend, 22-year-old Carlton Berry, spotted Neal near the doorway to the Academic Building, and Foster fired at Neal, who was wounded in the abdomen and leg, the documents said. Neal ran into the campus library and collapsed.

According to the affidavit, Neal told investigators that Foster shot him. Berry, who was shot in the leg, was arrested at the scene, and a manhunt for Foster ensued. Bobby Cliburn, a 55-year-old maintenance worker who was standing nearby, was shot in the leg.

The affidavit does not say who shot Berry and Cliburn.

Both Berry and Foster are charged with two felony counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Investigators were trying to determine whether Berry fired the handgun that was used. He is under police supervision at a Houston hospital and is being held on a $60,000 bond. Berry is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday.

Court documents say Foster is being held on a $50,000 bond and will appear in court Monday.

Found: Trey Foster, a suspect in Tuesday's shootout at a Houston college was found 250 miles away from campus, near the Dallas suburb of Plano

Arriving at the sheriff's office Friday morning, Foster acknowledged to reporters that he knew Berry but ignored other questions.

Witnesses reported seeing one person flee on foot after the shooting, the affidavit said.

Berry had a Lone Star College ID but officials are still determining whether he and Foster were enrolled at the school. Neal was pursuing his GED. Authorities do not expect to file charges against Neal, the Harris County Sheriff's Office has said.
