A chivalrous manner, respectfulness, politeness and good self-presentation are all traditional gentlemanly traits.

But It seems what defines a gentleman now varies greatly from person to person.

Thanks to the popularity of 
international best seller Fifty Shades Of Grey, one in ten women between the ages of 25 and 54 -
the ultimate 'mummy porn' market - consider cold and complicated 
Christian Grey the most perfect fictional gentleman.

EL James' literary trilogy, Fifty Shades Of Grey, left, brought to life Christian Grey, who was voted most perfect fictional gentleman by one in ten women aged 25 to 54, but Mr Darcy, played by Colin Firth, right, came top

But Pride And Prejudice's dashing Mark Darcy - who was initially similarly cold and complicated to Elizabeth Bennett - won the most votes overall, and has been voted the perfect fictional gentleman overall in the nationwide poll of British women.

Jane Austen's upper-crust character, brought to life by actor Colin Firth in the 1995 hit BBC mini-series, was named number one by almost a third (29.60 per cent) of British women polled.

He was followed by suave British spy James Bond (12.4 per cent), first made world famous by handsome Scot Sean Connery in the 1962 movie Dr. No.

Five other actors went on to play the debonair secret agent, with Daniel Craig the latest with his most recent box office smash Skyfall.

James Bond, most recently played by Daniel Craig, came in second with 12.4 per cent

And proof that women love a prince in 
real life or fantasy, the stock character Prince Charming was third, 
stealing one tenth of the vote.

The research of 1,000 women across 
the UK was commissioned by Johnson Cleaners in a bid to find who and 
what makes a gentleman in both fiction and reality.

While
noble Noah from tear-jerker The Notebook, played by the dishy Ryan 
Gosling, was the most popular fictional gentleman with women under 25.

And a quarter of women of all ages told researchers they wished their partner or husband was more like their favourite celebrity gentleman. This rose to a third of women in Northern Ireland.

Paul Ogle, MD of Johnson Cleaners, said: 'It is clear that many women love an old fashioned gentleman, either in fiction or reality. The qualities that make a gentleman are timeless and classic, just like the celebrities that came top of our research.'

But this figure drops to five per cent of all women in the UK insisting the infamous Christian Grey 
was their perfect fictional gent. But thatâ€™s still some 1.25million ladies.
