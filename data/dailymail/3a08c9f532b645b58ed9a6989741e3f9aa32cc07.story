Given the current economic climate, these should probably be handed out to everyone in Britain - a wallet that 'tightens up' when you run short of cash.

The wallets - working prototypes created by MIT - also 'swell' when you're rich, and shrink when you're low on funds, a feature that the researchers promise could 'help attract potential mates'.

'The wallet protects the money within it when you need to be thrifty with
a hinge that resists opening - it can be mapped to a monthly budget 
goal.'

The wallet 'protects' your money with a hinge that resists opening when you don't have much money left - you can map it to a monthly budget goal, and the wallet communicates with a phone via Bluetooth to stay up to date with your balance

The prototypes are connected to your phone by Bluetooth - and communicate via a tiny component in the wallet, which 'controls' a hinge.

'Our platform consists of Fingers, microprocessors 
embedded in personal objects, and Hand routing software running on a 
cell phone,' say the researchers.

'The wallet buzzes through a vibrating motor whenever your bank processes
a transaction.'

'This encourages a conscious connection between handing 
over your credit card and your hard-earned money being harvested from 
the bank, and alerts you to fraud when you get a buzz without making a 
purchase.'

The Proverbial Wallets are working prototypes, tough enough to sit on. They communicate with a phone through Bluetooth, using its data connection to get financial information from the user's bank accounts

The prototypes, known as Proverbial Wallets, are working prototypes - and actually DO buzz and 'clamp shut' when money runs short.

'The Proverbial Wallets are working prototypes, tough enough to sit on,' says the MIT lab. 'They communicate with a cellphone through Bluetooth, using its data 
connection to get financial information from the user's bank accounts.'

The big question is, of course, how much would a Bluetooth-equipped, motorised, computer-controlled wallet set you back - and would you save anything at all in the long run?
