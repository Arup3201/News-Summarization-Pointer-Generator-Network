A cat carrying a saw and a mobile phone was 'detained' as it entered a prison gate in northeast Brazil, it emerged today.

Prison guards were surprised when they saw a white cat crossing the main gate of the prison, its body wrapped with tape.

A closer look showed the feline also carried drills, an earphone, a memory card, batteries and a phone charger.

All 263 detainees in the prison of Arapiraca, a city of 215,000 people in the state of Alagoas, are considered suspect in the plot, which is being investigated by local police.

'It's tough to find out who's responsible for the action as the cat doesn't speak,' a prison spokesperson told local paper Estado de S.Paulo.

The cat was later taken to an animal disease centre to receive medical care.

The incident took place on New Year's Day but was first reported by national media on Saturday.
