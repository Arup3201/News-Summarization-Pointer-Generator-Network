Three British men including two former soldiers have been badly injured in a crash in South America as they were taking part in what is billed as the world's toughest rally.

A spokesman for the Race2Recovery team said a support vehicle the three team members were travelling in during the Dakar Rally was involved in a head-on collision in Peru which is believed to have left two other people dead.

The three men, who are part of a team of injured soldiers taking part in the challenge, were named as Justin Birchall, 40, a team driver and civilian volunteer from Burnley, Lancashire, whose Wildcat vehicle retired earlier in the race, former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer and Gulf War and Falklands war veteran Lee Townsend, a team mechanic, from Yate near Bristol, and retired Army Major John Winskill, 42, the team logistics expert, who is from Durrington, near Salisbury, Wiltshire.

The men were transferred to a local hospital and later flown by aircraft to another hospital in Lima where they are said to be 'stable and conscious' with injuries described as 'non-life-threatening'.

Their families have been informed of the accident by other team members.

The crash happened when their vehicle, a Land Rover Defender, was travelling in convoy on day five of the rally with other support vehicles in the Peruvian town of Tacna, near the Chilean border.

It is understood that two other vehicles were involved in the accident and two people received fatal injuries.

The Race2Recovery team, which has been raising funds for forces charities since 2011, is hoping to become the first disability team to complete the challenge

Team leader Captain Tony Harris said: 'Our hearts go out to the families and relatives of those who have died in this tragic accident and we offer them our condolences and sympathy.

'Our entire team has been struck by the friendliness and support we have received from the Peruvian people since arriving for the Dakar Rally.'

He said that the team had unanimously agreed to continue the challenge with the two remaining Wildcat vehicles.

'The team decided before we even started that we would continue our endeavour. This is obviously a huge shock but we know that we have the blessing of the injured. They want the team to finish,' the captain added.

The accident is believed to have happened at 9.30pm local time yesterday.

Tough going: The rally began in Lima on Saturday and ends in Santiago, Chile, on January 20

Perilous: The rally, described as the most dangerous in the world, and accidents like this are a common sight

It is being investigated by the local police in Peru and the team is being supported by the race organisers.

The Race2Recovery team, which has been raising funds for forces charities since 2011, is hoping to become the first disability team to complete the challenge.

The rally began in Lima on Saturday and ends in Santiago, Chile, on January 20.

It will see the team travel some 5,600 miles of extreme mountain and desert terrain that will take them through southern Peru, across the border into Argentina and then to Chile over 15 days.

The Race2Recovery team began the race with four Wildcat race vehicles along with additional support vehicles but will now continue with just two race vehicles.

Capt Harris, 31, who had his lower leg amputated while serving in Afghanistan, is one of the rally drivers.

The fleet of support vehicles include a 4x4 truck racing with it, plus 8x8 support trucks and a number of Land Rover Discovery vehicles to help move the support team and mechanical equipment.

The team has the motto Beyond Injury - Achieving The Extraordinary, and set up its Dakar Rally challenge to inspire people who may be injured, ill or facing adversity.

The 28-strong team includes British and US servicemen who were wounded in combat and have missing limbs, spinal injuries and psychological and fragmentation injuries.

They received royal backing when it became the first recipient of a grant from the Endeavour Fund, set up by the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

All proceeds raised by the team go to the Tedworth House Personnel Recovery Centre, Tidworth, Wiltshire, which is part of a Government-led initiative to help wounded and sick servicemen and women recover.

A host of celebrities including Dame Kelly Holmes and Robbie Williams took to social media to show their support for the Race2Recovery team and wish them luck as they set off.

Olympic and Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius, a motoring enthusiast, sent a video message praising them for putting the focus on ability rather than disability.
