To be in Colombo these last few days as England prepare for the first one-day international against Sri Lanka on Tuesday has been to marvel at a group of men who seem to be telling each other that the sky’s the limit.

At least that’s what they keep implying in public. In private, they may be rocking back and forth, muttering darkly about seven-match one-day series and six-week World Cups.

But, for the consumption of their supporters, England’s 50-over side is saying all the right things. No-fear attitude. Positive brand of cricket. Exciting times.

Honestly, you’d have to be a curmudgeon not to give them full marks.

And yet. Both this tour and the Tri-series in Australia ahead of the World Cup will tell us whether England can turn theory into practice – and even whether they really believe they can.

Years of building a platform for the first 35 overs can take its toll. It’s back-breaking work, and doesn’t always come off. Occasionally, you’re left with a solid enough structure. But the flourishes – the loft conversion, the solar-panelled roof, the stained-glass conservatory – feel like a luxury. They’re for David Warner and Glenn Maxwell.

Even amid the clarion calls from batting coach Mark Ramprakash, and the enthusiastic words of support from the top order, a sense remains that England don’t quite dare go for it.

Last week, coach Peter Moores explained why totals of 300 were – to sum up crudely – over-rated. It depends on the surface, he said. And in New Zealand – co-hosts of the World Cup and venue for three of England’s six group games – it is a rarity. If par is 270, said Moores, and you make 290, you are doing your job. There is some logic in this.

Yet take a look at New Zealand’s one-day series at home to India at the start of the year. New Zealand’s totals were 292 for seven, 271 for seven, 314 (match tied), 280 for three (batting second), and 303 for five.

There were runs aplenty, and England need to be in the right frame of mind to seek them out.

The omission from Friday’s warm-up game of Alex Hales felt too clever by half. Few top orders around the world would dare to leave out a player capable of scoring 116 not out off 64 balls, as Hales did against Sri Lanka at the World Twenty20 in March.

England believe he was exposed by India’s bowlers in the one-dayers at the end of the summer, and are concerned about his ability against spin. If this were the criteria for selection, the entire top six would struggle to get a game.

Moeen Ali’s six-fours-in-an-over heroics on against Sri Lanka A felt like the perfect riposte, but attitudes do not change overnight. Besides, Moeen’s inclusion is not the problem: he’s bowling well, and England need some proper overs from their top six.

The problem is an apparently widespread belief that a strike-rate of 80 from the top order will win you games. It is if you want to score 240 in 50 overs. But few sides do these days. Recently, Rohit Sharma made 264 all by himself.

To expect things to change now, only a couple of months away from the World Cup, is to be reminded of the last five World Cups. Each time, England arrived unsure of their strongest team. Each time, they failed to get beyond the first meaningful hurdle.

The suspicion remains that other countries treat 50-over games like extended Twenty20 matches, while England are more inclined to view them as shortened Tests.

Four successive one-day series defeats under Alastair Cook – the only victory, in the Caribbean, came when Stuart Broad was captain – suggests the approach needs some work. Monday afternoon’s session of power-hitting at the Premadasa felt more like it.

For England, it may well be alright on the night. They may even stun Sri Lanka, assuming the rain goes away. But hope and expectation converge less often than cricketers would like.

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

Eyeing the future

England assistant coach Paul Farbrace wearing the Google Glass during training in Colombo

England’s assistant coach Paul Farbrace took to the nets at Colombo’s R Premadasa Stadium on Monday sporting a Google Glass (right), an OHMD (optical head-mounted display, as if you didn’t know) which among other things allows users to film what’s going on in front of them without the bother of brandishing an iPhone.

The back-room staff will use the footage to decide whether the Google Glass can add to the array gizmos already at their disposal. One possibility is that will allow batsmen to determine how closely they really watch the ball.

The technology was used earlier in the year by Sri Lanka, when Farbrace was their coach. And it yielded a curious finding. When Lasith ‘the Slinger’ Malinga wore it to bowl during net sessions, the OHMD showed that, during his delivery stride, he looks at the batsman for only a split second.

As Farbrace put it: ‘It’s impressive enough that he manages to bowl such a good line with the arm coming round at that angle. But to do it without looking at the batsman is just amazing.’

Cook’s literary tastes

It was surprising to see Cook poolside at Colombo’s Taj Samudra hotel reading the book they’ve all been talking about. You know the one: temperamental star does it his way, upsetting people en route and staring out from the cover like some misunderstood genius.

We can only hope he enjoyed Roy Keane: The Second Half as much as the critics.

Murali’s advice for KP

A trip to the home of Muttiah Muralitharan at the weekend yielded some surprisingly trenchant views on Kevin Pietersen’s love of social media.

The gospel according to Murali is quite simple: ‘Don’t text, don’t tweet, don’t use Facebook. Just leave it. The public doesn’t need to know what you do and what you eat.

‘If you want to put your opinion about anything, have a press conference. Just leave it and enjoy your cricket. Why are you playing? To enjoy yourself. Show your talent rather than show other things.’

The fear is that particular ship may already have sailed.

Right man for the job

It must be great being a BCCI bigwig. The Supreme Court queries your probity, and you retort by reciting your CV. Sundar Raman, the IPL’s chief operating officer, was said by the Mudgal Report, investigating alleged corruption at the 2013 IPL, to have known ‘a contact of a bookie and contacted him eight times in one season’.

Raman’s response? ‘I hold a PG degree in management and prior to working with the BCCI, I was employed by a multinational media and advertising agency. In all, I have 20 years of experience as a professional with high integrity.’

And so on and so forth. Why didn’t he say so earlier!

When you think about it…

There are whispers that MS Dhoni, who has a finger injury, will miss more than the first Test of India’s series in Australia. He could, suggests one rumour, miss the entire series.

MS Dhoni is definitely out of India's first Test against Australia and could miss the entire series

This would have three benefits. India can blood Virat Kohli as their Test captain without saying he has deposed Dhoni.

Dhoni would be spared the possibility of equalling the world record for the number of overseas Test defeats as captain. His tally stands at 13. New Zealand’s Stephen Fleming and Brian Lara of West Indies both led their teams to 16 away losses.

And he could prepare for the World Cup, unencumbered by a form of the game he has never truly enjoyed. But those are all cynical theories…
