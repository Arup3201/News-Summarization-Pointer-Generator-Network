Glum times: Chancellor George Osborne has outlined austerity lasting until 2017-18 to wipe out the deficit racked up by Labour, but further savings of £60billion would be required

Britain faces further tax rises and spending cuts totalling nearly £60billion to get the creaking  public finances back under control, the Treasury watchdog warned yesterday.

The Office for Budget Responsibility said decades of austerity are required on top of the £153billion measures already planned to return the ballooning national debt to pre-recession levels.

‘It is clear that longer-term spending pressures, if unaddressed, would put finances on an unsustainable path,’ said chairman Robert Chote.

Mr Chote added that future governments faced ‘difficult choices’ to tackle the costs ‘of an ageing population and upward pressure on health spending’.

George Osborne has outlined austerity lasting until 2017-18 to wipe out the deficit racked up by Labour.

His plans were backed yesterday by the board of the International Monetary Fund, who disagreed with recent criticism of the cuts by the organisation’s chief economist.

But the OBR said further savings – possibly as much as £57billion – would be required after that to defuse the financial time bomb caused by the ageing population and soaring cost of the NHS.

It means the main political parties will go into the 2020 general election with the prospect of years of austerity ahead of them.

In its Fiscal Sustainability Report, published annually to examine the long-term outlook for the public finances, the OBR said it expected the national debt to fall from 85 per cent of national income in 2017-18 to 66 per cent in the early 2030s as the economy picks up.

But it warned that the national debt will start rising again and reach 99 per cent of gross domestic product by 2063 as longer life expectancies drive up the cost of pensions, health and social care. ‘This would clearly be unsustainable,’ it said in the report.

Allowing 140,000 immigrants of working age into Britain each year would help meet these care costs by boosting employment and tax receipts, the OBR concluded.

Carl Emmerson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said there will be little space for extra spending even after the current crisis is resolved. ‘Significant giveaways any time soon are looking unlikely,’ he said.

Meanwhile, Ed Balls has backtracked on his apology for the Labour government’s economic failure.

The shadow chancellor had admitted it was partly Labour’s fault that control of the City was too weak, but he said yesterday it was ‘a load of tosh’ that his party’s lack of financial regulation allowed the global crisis to take hold.
