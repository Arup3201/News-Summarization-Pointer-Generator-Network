Chris Hughton’s career in the Brighton dug-out got off to the best possible start as he saw his new side book their place in the FA Cup fourth round.

But for much of the tie it looked like these sides were heading for a replay but late goals from Lewis Dunk and Chris O’Grady made sure Brighton were in the hat for Monday’s draw.

Hughton - who was named as Sami Hyypia’s replacement this week - has a proud history in the FA Cup having won it twice in the 1980s with Tottenham and he fielded a strong team in his first game in charge.

Brentford had the better of the first half and were unlucky not to take the lead, but after the break it was Brighton who took control and eventually got the win they deserved thanks to Dunk’s header and Chris O’Grady’s cool finish.

As early as the third minute Brentford had a great chance to take the lead after Moses Odubajo shot was well saved by David Stockdale and the rebound fell into the path of Andre Gray - but the striker somehow managed guide his shot along the goal line and not over it.

Stockdale was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers and he was again called into action when Spanish midfielder Jota’s tricky run set up Jon Toral but his shot was well saved by the Brighton keeper.

Brentford handed a rare start to Jack Bonham in goal and the 21-year-old did a good job in intercepting Joao Carlos Teixeira’s cross as Craig Mackail-Smith was lurking dangerously at the far post.

Bonham had to be alert to keep out Solly March early in the second half after Mackail-Smith made a good break as Brighton looked to up the tempo after the break.

Neither side looked like they wanted a replay and Gray again had a great chance to give his side the lead when the ball fell to him in the middle of the penalty area but he pulled his shot wide.

Brighton boss Hughton must have been scratching his head minutes later when wondering how his side were not in front.

March had two great chances to put the visitors ahead. He nicked the ball off Odubajo on the edge of the area and saw his shot cannon off the post and then minutes later when his shot seemed to go under Bonham, but the ball trickled wide of the goal.

Another mix up at the back for Brentford allowed substitute Chris O’Grady to go through on goal, but he also managed to hit the post when it seemed easier to score.

But finally the goal they deserved did come when Dunk rose highest to head home March’s free kick from inside a crowded penalty area.

And in stoppage time Adam Chicksen played in O’Grady and he curled the ball past Bonham to make sure of the result.
