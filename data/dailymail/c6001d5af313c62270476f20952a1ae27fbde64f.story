Although Christopher Columbus is widely credited as the 'discoverer' of America, a new loan form to the first sailor to find North America hints that other expeditions might have found the continent BEFORE 1492.

The loan to John Cabot - discovered by historical detective work - makes reference to 'THE new land', hinting that sailors had discovered America BEFORE Cabot or Columbus.

Christopher Columbus famously sailed to the Caribbean islands in 1492 - but with a royal patent from Henry VII of 
England, John Cabot, a Venetian merchant, sailed from Bristol to North America in 1497.

The new discovery shows that the first 
European to set foot in North America since the Viking Leif Ericsson in 
the 11th Century was financed by a loan of 50 nobles (£16, 13s, 4d) from
 the Bardi banking house.

Just like Columbus, the Engish voyages were financed by the great Italian merchant banks of the era, receiving the loan in 1496.

John Cabot - also known as Zuan Caboto or Giovanni Chabotte due to his Venetian birth - made two voyages, one in the summer of 1496, one in 1497.

On the second journey, he landed in Newfoundland.

The entry itself is also curious in 
that the reference to ‘the new land’ implies that the money was given so
 that Cabot could find a land that was already known about.

As
 such, it may revive claims that Bristol merchants had discovered North 
America at an earlier time. Dr Guidi-Bruscoli is more cautious on this 
score, however. ‘While the entry implies that the Bardi believed in a 
prior discovery, we can't assume this had occurred.

'It
 is likely the Bardi were referring to the mythical 'Island of Brasil', 
which Bristol mariners certainly claimed had been found by one of their 
number in times past. Whether this story can be equated with an actual 
discovery is much more uncertain, however.’

Dr
 Jones agrees. ‘It would be wonderful to find that Bristol mariners had 
first visited North America before the 1480s – if only because it would 
cast new light on the originality of Columbus' venture of 1492. Right 
now, however, we can't be sure about that. Although one never knows, 
that could change.’

Although Christopher Columbus is widely credited as the 'discoverer' of America, an English expedition found North America first - with a little help from a Florentine merchant bank

Dr Evan Jones, who leads the project in 
Bristol, describes the new evidence as a ‘fantastic find’. He adds, ‘We 
have long known that Italy's great merchant banks were key to the 
success of the ventures launched by Portugal and Spain. But it always 
seemed that the English ventures were an exception. Now it is clear that
 they too were part of network of Italian-financed expeditions to 
explore beyond the limits of the known world.’

The
 payment of 50 nobles (£16 13s. 4d.) was made so that 'Giovanni 
Chabotte' of Venice, as he is styled in the document, could undertake 
expeditions 'to go and find the new land'.

The
 second of these was to result in the European discovery of North 
America – Christopher Columbus not having ventured beyond the Caribbean 
islands.

Dr Guidi-Bruscoli,
 who is based at the University of Florence and is also a Fellow at 
Queen Mary in London, found the financial records after being contacted 
by Jones and his co-researcher, Margaret Condon.

For several years they have been attempting to relocate the research findings of a deceased historian, Dr Alwyn Ruddock.

She had made some extraordinary finds about Cabot's voyages, but had all her notes destroyed following her death in 2005.

One of Ruddock's claims was that Cabot was financed by an Italian bank.

She had, however, refused to reveal the source of her information.

Following an invitation to visit the deceased historian's house in 2010, Jones and Condon discovered the source – in the form of a sticky label on an old shoe cupboard: 'The Bardi firm of London'.

They then contacted Dr Guidi-Bruscoli in Florence, who was able to locate the archive, the financial ledger and the entry concerned.

Finding out about the funding of Cabot's voyages is exciting because, while it has long been known that the explorer received political support from the King, the identity and motivations of those who paid for the expeditions has never been known.
