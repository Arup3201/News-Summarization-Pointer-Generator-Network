A 15-year-old girl was  waited for a bus in North Tyneside when a man snatched her away, bundled her into a car, drove her round the corner and raped her.

She was approached by a man said to be in his late 40s or early 50s at a bus stop in Wallsend, near Newcastle, before he grabbed her and took her into the front seat of his vehicle.

He then drove to a residential street around Hotspur Road and raped her.

The girl managed to escape after the attack, but police say she has been left traumatised by the late-night incident. 

The man is described as being white and around 5ft 3ins tall, with a large build and shaved grey hair. He spoke with a Geordie accent.

The incident happened between 10.55pm on Friday April 25 and 11.30pm on Saturday April 26, but was only reported to police on Tuesday.
