Carmageddon, the traffic doomsday Californian drivers had been warned to expect with the temporary closing of LA's busiest freeway appears to have been averted with the road re-opening ahead of schedule.

For weeks drivers had been warned to stay away from the stretch of Interstate 405 that will be shuttered through the Sepulveda Pass on LA's west side for a bridge’s completion planned before Monday morning’s traffic crunch.

But according to the mayor's office all lanes of the 405 Freeway opened hours ahead of schedule on Sunday night meaning traffic should be flowing as normal for the Monday commute.

Mayor Antonio Villaragosa thanked LA drivers for staying off the roads and turning 'Carmageddon into Carma-Heaven.'

He said:'First things first: We are not done yet, and the freeway will not open until 5 o'clock in the morning as we said it would," said the Mayor at a press conference on Sunday. "That being said -- we are on track.

The real stars of Carmageddon II were the motorists who enjoyed a car-free weekend.'But traffic was flowing freely in the 
area after ten miles of the world’s busiest freeways were shut down at 
midnight yesterday in Los Angeles, with no traffic jams reported by 
Sunday morning.

There have been a few trespassers, however, that ran into some midnight trouble.

Seven people were arrested Sunday morning for sneaking onto the closed freeway for a stroll, a newlywed couple amongst them.

NBC reports that the lovebirds entered the freeway at the Sunset Boulevard onramp in West Los Angeles and were immediately detained by waiting law enforcement.

Explaining themselves, they told police officers 'that they thought it would be fun to inaguerate their wedding' by walking on the freeway.

Both got citations for trespassing, NBC reported.

'Now they have two documents with their names on them,' LAPD Lt Andy Neiman said, 'a marriage certificate and a citation from the California Highway Patrol.'

A group of rollerbladers made up the other five charged.

During a similar closure last year commuters stayed away from the freeway in droves, the shutdown was considered a success, and crews finished the first phase of the work early.

This time, the contractor faces a 
hefty penalty if the work isn't done in 53 hours: $6,000 per lane of 
freeway every 10 minutes that goes beyond its completion time.

'The
penalty is $6,000 per lane of freeway, per 10 minutes. Let's assume the
entire freeway isn't reopened, that's $60,000 every 10 minutes,' Los 
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Dave 
Sotero told KCBS-TV.

Meanwhile, TV news crews have a plan to avoid a traffic jam in the sky as they cover the shutdown.

Residents complained of low-flying, noisy helicopters hovering nonstop over the region last year.

'It was constant,' Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association, whose members live in many of the homes closest to the freeway, recently told The Associated Press. 'It was a combination of the news media paparazzi and tour operators taking people who wanted to get a picture of the 405.'

Although
the area gets its share of paparazzi helicopters because of Charlie 
Sheen and other celebrities who live in the area, Close said they 
usually go away when the sun sets.

During Carmageddon, however, the area is brightly illuminated overnight so construction workers can safely do their jobs.

This
time, local television news directors have plans to pool coverage by 
using video from a single helicopter making limited flights over the 
freeway, according to Rick Terrell, executive director of the Radio 
& Television News Association of Southern California.

The participating stations include major broadcasters including KABC-TV, KCBS-TV and KTTV-TV.
