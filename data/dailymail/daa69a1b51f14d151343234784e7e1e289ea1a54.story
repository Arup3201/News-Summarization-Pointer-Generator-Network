Somali pirates have threatened to kill an American hostage after a daring night-time U.S Navy SEAL mission to rescue two foreign aid workers.

The pirates have moved the hostage at least three times in 24 hours in reaction to the rescue of the U.S. woman and Danish man.

Their response has now raised questions about whether other Western captives are now in greater danger.

'If they try again, we will all die together,' warned Hassan Abdi, a Somali pirate connected to the gang holding the American, who was kidnapped on Saturday in northern Somalia.

'It's difficult to hold U.S. hostages, because it's a game of chance: die or get huge money. But we shall stick with our plans and will never release him until we get a ransom,' Abdi said.

Overnight on Wednesday, U.S. Navy SEALs parachuted into Somalia and hiked to the base where the pirates were holding 32-year-old American Jessica Buchanan and Poul Hagen Thisted, a 60-year-old Dane.

A gun battle ensued and nine of the pirates were killed. The hostages were freed unharmed. No casualties have been reported among the U.S. forces.

In response the gang holding the American kidnapped in the northern town of 
Galkayo have moved him three times, Abdi said.

'Holding hostages in one place is unlikely now because we are the next target,' he told The Associated Press by telephone.

He also expressed concern that the U.S. has pirate informants.

'It
wasn't just a hit-and-run operation, but long planned with the help of 
insiders among us,' Abdi said, noting that the Americans struck at a 
time when the pirates were least on their guard.

U.S.
State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said officials have 
been in contact with the family of the latest American kidnapping 
victim.

'We are also working with our 
contacts in Kenya and in Somalia to try to get more information,' Nuland
told reporters in Washington.

'Obviously
we condemn kidnapping of any kind and call for the immediate release of
the victims - any victims. We also would note that our travel warning 
for Somalia does caution U.S. citizens about the risk of travel.'

After their rescue, Miss Buchanan and Mr Thisted were flown to the U.S. Naval Air Base at Sigonella on the 
Italian island of Sicily to undergo medical screenings and other 
evaluations before heading home, a U.S. defense official said.

Miss Buchanan's family was meeting her at the base, which is the hub of U.S. Navy air operations in the Mediterranean.

The pair had been working for the 
Danish De-mining Group, part of the Danish Refugee Council, when they 
were abducted by gunmen near the north-central town of Galkay in 
October.

Danish Foreign Minister Villy Sovndal
said Miss Buchanan's poor health had led the U.S. to take action and
the operation did not necessarily pave the way for further missions

An ailing Frenchwoman kidnapped by Somali gunmen died in captivity last year after not having access to her medication.

Message: Barack Obama, who authorised the rescue mission, called Miss Buchanan's father John to say: 'All Americans have Jessica in our thoughts and prayers, and give thanks that she will soon be reunited with her family'

There is mixed opinion on the effect the U.S. raid will have on the situation with other 
captives, with one pirate warning that other U.S. hostages might suffer as a 
result.

However a Western official in Kenya said that the killings of the nine captors might make pirates 
think twice about taking more captives.

He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.

On Wednesday evening, hours after the U.S. military raid, the gang holding the American hostage started circulating false rumours that they had executed him.

Another security official who has years of experience in the region said it was likely the men holding the American would move him onto a ship with other foreign hostages, because ships were easier to defend and planning rescue operations is more complicated when hostages from other countries are involved.

At least one pirate agreed with his analysis.

'I think land captivity is going to end now. Sea is much safer,' pirate Mohamed Nur said by phone from the coastal town of Hobyo. 'Even ships are not very safe, but you can at least hit back and resist.'

Other hostages held in Somalia include a British tourist and two Spanish aid workers seized in neighboring Kenya, a French military adviser and 155 sailors of various nationalities hijacked at sea.
