Arsenal are willing to listen to offers for right-back Carl Jenkinson with Newcastle showing interest.

The 22-year-old could be offered as part of the £11m deal for Mathieu Debuchy, who has undergone a medical ahead of a move to Newcastle, although Newcastle have also asked about Joel Campbell on loan.

Newcastle have also been offered Micah Richards from Manchester City and are maintaining interest in Feyenoord's Daryl Janmaat and Ricardo van Rhijn of Ajax.

The Magpies are keen to bolster an attack that has seen Loic Remy leave after his loan period and has a mis-firing Papiss Cisse as its main striker.

Campbell seems to fit the bill for Newcastle as Arsenal are considering loaning out the World Cup star in order for him to gain valuable experience.

Interest: Newcastle are keen to take Costa Rica's Joel Campbell on loan from Arsenal next season

Target: Micah Richards is also a potential replacement for Debuchy having been offered to Newcastle
