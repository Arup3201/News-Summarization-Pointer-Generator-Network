New footage has emerged showing Oscar Pistorius acting loved-up with his girlfriend just ten days before he shot her dead.

The images of the double amputee athlete and Reeva Steenkamp were captured on CCTV at a grocery store on February 4 last year.

They show the pair laughing and flirting, before Pistorius plants a kiss on his girlfriend's lips.

Loved-up: Oscar Pistorius plants a kiss on Reeva Steenkamp's lips at a grocery store on February 4 last year

In the footage broadcast by Sky News, the paralympian can be seen wearing a white top, cream trousers and yellow trainers.

He and his girlfriend appear in good spirits as they browse the store - laughing and joking around as they pick up a variety of grocery items.

They were later remembered by staff at the store after leaving a massive R100 (Â£8) tip. 

Pistorius had been dating Miss Steenkamp 
for several months when he killed her by firing shots through the bathroom door of his home on Valentine's Day last year.

Tragic: Pistorius shot dead his model and TV star girlfriend at his South Africa home on Valentine's Day 2013

He has admitted shooting the model and reality TV star - but claims he fired at her after mistaking her for a dangerous intruder in the night.

However, prosecutors say he had a fight with his girlfriend in the hours before the shooting - with several witnesses claiming to have heard the pair rowing.

Pistorius is due to appear at North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, on Monday accused of the murder of Miss Steenkamp.

 pistol he used when he killed Ms Steenkamp.

In the images, Francois Hougaard, a South African international rugby player, can be seen shooting alongside Pistorius.
