Bill de Blasio has picked the former New York police commissioner who cleaned up the city in the 1990s to lead the department once again.

William Bratton, 66, rose to national fame under Mayor Rudy Giuliani for his 'zero tolerance' approach to policing and his 'broken windows' strategy of targeting small infractions as a way to combat more serious crimes and lower murder rates. He also pioneered CompStat, the data-driven system of tracking crimes that is now used by nearly every major police force in the nation.

Critics have already chimed in, saying that Bratton is a bad choice if the mayor-elect wants to move away from tactics like stop-and-frisk and improve NYPD relations with the city's black and Hispanic communities. 

City Councilman Charles Barron called 
Bratton's appointment 'unconscionable' and said he was the man who 
invented stop-and-frisk and other strategies that disproportionately target
 minorities.

Controversial choice: Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, right, picked former NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, left, to lead the police again. One councilman says Bratton is the man who invented stop-and-frisk

De Blasio made reducing stop-and-frisk one of the keys to his candidacy as mayor. His opponents claimed this meant he would be soft on crime and would return New York to the 'bad old days' of high murder rates.

But Bratton has supported such tactics in the past - even calling stop-and-frisk 'essential to every police department in America.' As Los Angeles Police Chief he oversaw a 49percent increase in police stops.

He was nearly the top cop in London, as well. Prime Minister David Cameron wanted him to lead the Metropolitan Police Service, but his nomination was blocked by the Home Office, which said the Met Commissioner must be both familiar with British laws and a British citizen.

On Thursday de Blasio introduced Bratton as a 'proven crime-fighter' - signaling that he wanted a man with a history of tough tactics to lead the city's 34,500 officers.

'Together, we are going to preserve and 
deepen the historic gains we've made in public safety - gains Bill 
Bratton helped make possible,' de Blasio said in a statement.

Bratton, who has also led the Boston and Los Angeles police departments, will succeed Raymond Kelly, the NYPD's longest-serving commissioner. He is arguably the most important administration appointment for de Blasio, a Democrat who takes office January 1.

Bratton beat out a black and a Hispanic candidate for the job of New York's top cop - but de Blasio said his hiring will still pave the way for better relationship between the NYPD and minority groups in.

He said the city can keep its crime rates low by 'rejecting the false choice between keeping New Yorkers safe and protecting their civil rights. This is an administration that will do both.' 

The bad old days: When Bratton took over, murders topped 1,500 a year and middle class families fled for the suburbs in droves

Bratton, holding a library book called 'Your Police,' which inspired him to go into law enforcement, pledged to forge a better relationship between the NYPD and minority communities

When William Bratton was hired as New York Police Commissioner in 1994, there were 1,561 murders in the city. When he left in 1996, there were 983.

He oversaw a 60percent drop in homicides in just two years - and he says he did it by focusing on vandals, petty thieves and squeegee men who harassed motorists.

Bratton adopted a 'zero tolerance' policy toward crime and employed the 'broken windows' theory that small-time lawlessness leads to big-time crime.

Police fanned out across the city and cracked down on small crimes. Combined with civil efforts spear-headed by Mayor Rudy Giuliani, broken windows were fixed and graffiti was washed away.

Crimes such as subway fare evasion, public drinking and public urination were no longer ignored.

The tactic remains controversial - though some see it as the precursor to 'stop and frisk.'

Proponents say stop and frisk works by getting guns off the streets and by putting criminals on notice that they are likely of being caught if they carry drugs or weapons - even if they appear to be doing nothing wrong.

Subsequent studies, however, have disputed the efficacy of 'broken windows' policies.

He said Bratton can 'heal some of the wounds, reopen the communication' and that Bratton would 'avoid focusing resources where they don't belong, which is on innocent, hardworking New Yorkers, particularly on our young men of color.'

At the press conference announcing his appointment, Bratton held up a children's library book, 'Your Police,' which he said made him decide to became a police officer. He pledged responsive, responsible policing.

'This is not deja vu all over again,' Bratton said.

'If we get it right, if we make the city safe, if we do it in a way that the public trusts us, then the benefits are extraordinary. If we get it right here, this is in many respects a beacon that can light the world.

'I don't want to do it all over again the same way. I want what (de Blasio) is promising - a new day.'

He said some stop-and-frisk tactics are necessary - but suggested they will be scaled back from the current level under his leadership.

'Stop and frisk is essential to every police department in America. But itâ€™s also essential that it be done constitutionally and respectfully. And that is my commitment to this mayor and to the city that it will be done that way,' he said.

That promise isn't enough for New York City Councilman Charles Barron, who said that Bratton 'failed us' when he was commissioner in the 1990s.

'Bratton is the architect of racial profiling stop and frisk,' he told NBC New York.

Center for Constitutional Rights, which is spearheading the legal action over stop-and-frisk, sounded a note of caution.

'We hope Bratton's appointment is not a signal from de Blasio that the NYPD will be ramping up so-called 'broken windows' policing, surveillance, and numbers-driven policing. As Mr. Bratton himself has stated, constitutional policing is not inconsistent with effective policing,' the group said in a statement.

Bratton made the cover of Time magazine in 1996 for his success at lowering the crime rate in New York City

Bratton, a Boston native, got his start in the national spotlight as the Boston Police Commissioner. He pioneered the 'CompStat' strategy of policing through the analysis of crime statistics

Civil Rights leader the Reverend Al 
Sharpton acknowledged he has been both an ally and adversary to Bratton 
during his previous tenure, but hopes the leaders can work together 'to 
continue the decrease of violence and crime in our community.'

Bratton, known for his outsized personality and fondness for the limelight, was police commissioner under Giuliani, a Republican, from 1994 to 1996. He emphasized the broken-windows theory of police work: that criminals who commit small crimes, such as vandalism, also commit more serious crimes.

Bratton helped spearhead the use of CompStat, a data-driven system of tracking crimes that allows police to better allocate their resources to high-crime areas. The real-time system is still used today.

Crime immediately plummeted under Bratton, who benefited from an influx of new police officers.

The year before Bratton took office, there were 1,946 murders citywide; by contrast, in 1996 there were 983, the first time it had dipped under 1,000 since 1968.

But Bratton frequently fought with Giuliani over who deserved the lion's share of the credit. He resigned after two years.

William Bratton is the only man to ever lead the police departments in both New York and Los Angeles. And he would have been the police commissioner in London, as well, if David Cameron had had his way.

The 66-year-old Bratton is recognized as one of the foremost experts on policing in the world and pioneered tactics that are used in nearly every major city in the country today.

He began his career as a beat cop in his native Boston after serving in the Vietnam War. He quickly rose through the ranks and served as Boston Police Commissioner for six months from 1993 to 1994.

In 1994, Giuliani appointed Bratton NYPD Commissioner - continuing his 'broken windows' strategy that he pursued when he was New York Transit Police Chief from 1990 until 1992.

Crime fell dramatically under Bratton's tenure - but he quickly clashed with the mayor over who deserved credit for making the city safer. Giuliani also disagreed with some of Bratton's policies.

He resigned from the department in 1996 amid allegations of ethics violations - which Bratton allies said were minor and politically-motivated.

In 2002, he was hired to lead the LAPD as the department sought to repair its reputation in the wake of the Los Angeles riots.

He lowered crime and was widely credited with improving police relations with the community. He served in Los Angeles until 2009 - when he left to work as a private consultant.

In 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron offered to make him commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London, as the city recovered from riots and spike in crime. Home Secretary Theresa May objected, however, and said he could not lead the force because he was neither a British citizen nor familiar with British laws.

Instead, he joined as a consultant. For his work, he was awarded the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.
