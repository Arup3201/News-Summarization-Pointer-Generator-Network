Former chief constable of North Yorkshire Police Grahame Maxwell, who along with Adam Briggs, has been asked to pay back £100,000 after a review of the legality of allowances paid to them

A disgraced former chief constable and his deputy who left their force after being embroiled in a high level nepotism inquiry have been asked to pay back £100,000 in allowance payments.

North Yorkshire's former chief constable Grahame Maxwell and his deputy Adam Briggs will be written to and asked to pay back 
the cash after a review of historic and current payments made by the force.

If repayment is not forthcoming, the 
North Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Julie Mulligan will seeking legal advice on potential further steps 
to recover the money.

Mr Maxwell was the chief until last year, when his contract was not renewed. Mr Briggs retired two years ago.

Both were 
embroiled in controversy over allegations that they helped relatives in 
police recruitment processes.

Mr Maxwell was given a final written 
warning after admitting gross misconduct following claims of nepotism.

His deputy Mr Briggs was cleared of 
helping a relative get round part of the recruitment process to become a
PC but still received 'management advice' as a result of the 
investigation into his conduct.

Mr Maxwell's contract was not renewed last year and he left the force with a controversial £250,000 golden goodbye.

Today, Ms Mulligan and 
current chief constable Dave Jones published a decision notice on their 
review about the allowances paid to them while they were in their posts.

Ms
Mulligan said the review was commissioned to see whether all elements 
of chief police officer allowance packages paid in the past had a solid 
legal basis.

Details of the specific elements of pay involved have not been disclosed but they are understood to included payment of 'personal development' allowances and a car allowance.

The notice 
said: 'The review found that there were some elements which were paid to
Mr Maxwell and Mr Briggs that, although decided upon in good faith at 
the time, do not appear with hindsight to have been within the legal 
power of the police authority.

'Whilst additional details are sought and further specialist legal advice is obtained, commissioner Julia Mulligan is asking for certain sums to be repaid by former chief police officers, specifically Mr Maxwell and Mr Briggs.

'The total amount involved is £99,866, identified over the six-year period examined by the review. The commissioner is also seeking further information on past payments and expenditure.'

In a joint statement, Ms Mulligan and Mr Jones said: 'This report was commissioned as a consequence of public concern locally about payments made to former chief officers.

Embroiled in controversy: Adam Briggs, former Deputy Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police

'We have decided to take a series of actions, including seeking repayment of almost £100,000, to resolve this issue once and for all.

'Once the report has been published, it will be the first time North Yorkshire Police will have published a report of this nature, and is in stark contrast to the old way of doing business and keeping reports like these under lock and key.

'It is an example of how committed we are to transparency and openness.'

Ms Mulligan told BBC Radio York: 'It's taxpayers' money they have had and we have asked for them to pay it back.'

Asked whether the North Yorkshire review had ramifications for other force areas, Mrs Mulligan said: 'It definitely does. I've spoken to a number of commissioners who are facing similar circumstances and they are going through a similar process, considering what action they are going to take and seeking legal advice.

'In the light of what's happened here, I absolutely would say PCCs do need to have a really good look at this and I do know that many of them are.'
