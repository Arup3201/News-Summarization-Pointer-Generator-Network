A 4,000-year-old Egyptian statue which was sold by a council for nearly £16million to an overseas buyer has been banned from leaving Britain.

The statue of Sekhemka, a limestone figure which is just 30in high, was controversially sold by Northampton Borough Council for £15.76m last year to a mystery buyer abroad.

But the council was accused of committing ‘a great act of folly’ by The Save Sekhemka Statue Action group, who feared the ancient relic could disappear into private ownership overseas.

Now the culture minister Ed Vaizey has ordered a four-month export ban on the relic leaving the British Isles after Arts Council England ruled the sale breached standards for how museums manage their collections.

That ban could even be extended to March 2016 if a ‘serious intention to raise funds to purchase the statue is made’, Arts Council England said.

The statue, which dates from 2,400BC, is a tomb model of a kilt-wearing high official surrounded by his wife, son and seven offering bearings.

Mr Vaizey praised the figure as a work of ‘outstanding aesthetic importance’, and ‘the finest example of its kind anywhere in the world.’

But in July last year the council sold off the piece, which they have owned for more than 100 years, insisting it wasn’t the centrepiece of their collection.

The Egyptian government called on the statue to be returned to Egypt if Northampton did not want it, and said the sale ran counter to the values and role of museums worldwide.

A Northampton council spokesman said the export ban had ‘no impact’ on the council’s sale of the statue – and insisted it was a matter for the government and Arts Council England to resolve between them.

The statue of Sekhemka was found during a 19th century archaeological dig near Cairo. The tomb model shows a seated man wearing a kilt and wig, with his wife, son and offering-bearers.

Sekhemka was a high level scribe who lived in the Old Kingdom sometime between 2,700BC and 2,2250BC - the period of Egyptian history when the pyramids of Giza were built.

In a country that was mainly illiterate, his ability to read and write means he would have been a person of high status with access to high offices.

At first, tomb statues - a sign of wealth - were reserved for the royal family. 

But as the economy improved, officials like Sekhemka who held high-ranking positions could afford to pay craftsmen to create likenessess of themselves for their tomb.

They served two purposes: to act as a record of the way the person looked, and to ensure that the offerings he desired for his survival in the afterlife - listed on the papyrus carried in the statue's hands - were made after his death.

It is unkown exactly when the statue arrived at Northampton Museum, but records indicate it was on display before the end of the 1890s. It has been on display at various Norhampton museums until two years ago.

The statue, which stands just 30in high, has been praised as a work of 'outstanding aesthetic importance' by culture minister Ed Vaizey. 

He added it was 'the finest example of any kind in the world'.

Its sale in July last year - a bid to raise money to extend Northampton's museum and art gallery - was heavily criticised.
