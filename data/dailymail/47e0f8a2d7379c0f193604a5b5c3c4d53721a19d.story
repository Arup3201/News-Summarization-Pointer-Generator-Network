Hallmark has provoked outrage and ridicule from its customers after changing the words of a traditional Christmal carol on a festive ornament.

The gaudy, red sweater ornament has dropped the word 'gay' for the word 'fun' in the lyric from the 19th-century carol Deck The Halls.

The original line - 'Don we now our gay apparel' - has been altered by the Kansas-City based company for its new line of holiday merchandise. It now reads: 'Don we now our FUN apparel.'

Break from tradition: Hallmark released this sweater ornament as part of its holiday line, changing the words of carol Deck The Halls to: 'Don we now our FUN apparel!'

The ornament of the holiday sweater, decorated with bells, bow and priced at $12.95, is described as: 'When it comes to Christmas sweaters, gaudy can be good! Hang up this flashy sweater to make your tree's outfit complete.

'With its catchy phrase, Don we now our FUN apparel! everyone will be in on the joke.'

Deck the Halls is a traditional Christmas carol with the tune dating back to 16th century Wales when it was called Nos Galan.

The English lyrics were composed by the Scottish musician Thomas Oliphant in the late 19th century (although the 'fa la la' comes from the original Welsh).

Carols were originally intended to be dances and not songs - and initially frowned upon by the church.

Deck The Halls first appeared in the Pennsylvania School Journal in 1877 and was described as a 'Welsh air'.

It has remained popular during the holidays ever since. In 1999, country music group SHeDAISY released a version of the song for Disney film Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas.

Deck The Halls is also the title of a 2006 comedy starring Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick and Kristin Davis.

However the break with the traditional carol sparked anger among Hallmark customers who took to the company's Facebook page to complain.

Val Buoni posted on Thursday: 'Hallmark has just made my boycott list for the idiotic change of lyrics in Deck the Halls. I will NEVER purchase anything from Hallmark again.

'Furthermore your ridiculous attempt at political correctness assumes that homosexuals dress differently. So you've alienated Christians as well as homosexuals.....good job Hallmark.'

Paul J Kettle Jr added: 'I
am disturbed to hear that you have removed the long-standing word "gay"
from your ornament. Had you not taken the politically-motivated 
stance, nobody would have noticed or complained.

'Now, you have brought 
this to the fore you are attracting attention, mostly negative. I have 
used Hallmark exclusively for cards over many years, but I am thinking 
now of migrating to another brand.'

Customer Thomas F Reynolds blasted the company: 'We just cut up our gold crown card we have had forever. Keep rewriting Christmas carols and you will end up filing for bankruptcy. Disgraceful!'

In a statement today, the company said: 
'Hallmark created this year's Holiday Sweater ornament in the spirit of 
fun. When the lyrics to "Deck the Halls" were translated from Gaelic and
published in English back in the 1800s, the word "gay" meant festive or
merry.

Hallmark customers were quick to post their outrage on the company's Facebook page on Thursday

Another Hallmark customer with a gold crown rewards card slammed the retailer for their decision to change a Christmas carol

Today it has multiple meanings, which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation.

The trend of wearing festively decorated Christmas sweaters to parties is all about fun, and this ornament is intended to play into that, so the planning team decided to say what we meant: "fun."

'That's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it.'
