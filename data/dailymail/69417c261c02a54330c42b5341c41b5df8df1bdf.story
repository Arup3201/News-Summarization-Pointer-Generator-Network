The mother of a 17-year-old girl who was killed after a tree fell onto her static home while she was sleeping, desperately tried to comfort her as she lay dying, it has today been claimed.

Tess Peirce was sleeping in a separate caravan to her daughter Bethany Freeman, when St Jude's Storm struck this morning.

It is believed Ms Peirce had discovered the 30ft fallen fir tree across her Bethany's temporary bedroom when she left her own caravan and was trying to talk to her daughter while firefighters fought to free her.

Despite attempts to resuscitate the teenager, she died a short while later at the scene.

Neighbours Helen O'Connell and her partner Frederic Perdrix were at home next door to the barn in Hever, Kent, when Ms Peirce came round this morning urgently seeking help.

Terrible accident: Bethany Freeman, 17, was crushed when this tree fell on her while she lay in bed (pictured). She was comforted by her mother but could not be saved

The 17-year-old girl died after a tree fell onto the static home she was sleeping in at Hever, Kent

Emergency services were called to the scene in Hever, Edenbridge, but the girl is believed to have died from her injuries

The caravan was parked in a yard when a tree fell onto it during the storm - crushing it completely

Ms O'Connell said: 'She came round here wanting some help. She was absolutely distraught. She said she had come out of her caravan this morning and had found the other caravan with her daughter in it had been flattened by a huge fallen tree.

'Tess said she could hear Beth speaking. She wanted our help to get her out. All the neighbours came out to try and help.

'A farmer came round with his JCB truck to try and lift the tree off the crushed caravan.

'It was awful. We were trying to console Tess while they tried to get Beth out.

'I think Tess was trying to talk to Beth, trying to comfort her.

'There was no power because the electricity had gone off so we couldn't use any power tools. Neighbours were rallying to find a petrol run chainsaw which eventually someone did.

'But eventually they said Beth had died and there was nothing anyone could do for her.'

The neighbour said that Ms Peirce lived in one of the caravans with two of her three sons - one of them lived elsewhere.

It is believed Ms Peirce had applied for planning permission to convert one of the buildings for her and her family to live in and the other building she planned to set up as respite accommodation for terminally ill people. The family were living in the caravans while the renovations were carried out.

Ms Peirce added: 'It's such an awful tragedy. They are a really nice family. I feel so upset for them.'

Emergency services were called to Hever in Edenbridge at 7.18am following reports that the 17-year-old girl was seriously injured. But teams were unable to save her

Teams gather at the scene in Hever. Kent woke yesterday morning to winds reaching topping 80mph and more than 100 trees felled

Farmer Greg Pickering, 32, a father of one, was asked by the police to use his JCB truck in efforts to rescue Bethany.

He said: 'The police phoned me at half past seven this morning and said they needed my help. They said a young girl was trapped and they needed me to help lift something with my JCB.

'I ran down and got the truck and drove to where it was. Initially they told me to wait because there were firemen cutting branches off the tree.

'Then they called me forward and I used my truck to lift the caravan and tree off the girl.

'They got her out and tried to resuscitate her but it was no good.

'Apparently at 7 o'clock this morning she'd been able to speak to her mother from under the tree but there'd been nothing from her since then.

'Her mum and two brothers were completely devastated, they were inconsolable. There were absolutely horrific scenes.

'They'd been looking to build their dream home there and were living in the caravans while that was happening but they were having difficulties with getting planning permission.

'It's all so terribly tragic.'

Meanwhile the search continues for a 14-year-old boy feared dead after being swept out to sea while playing in the surf - hours before 99 mph winds battered Britain.

The teenager has been named by sources as Dylan Alkins, who is thought to have disappeared while playing in the surf at West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex, at about 4.15pm yesterday.

It comes as the most dangerous storm for years has torn apart Britain with gusts of almost 100mph ripping up trees, causing flash flooding and leaving at least 220,000 homes without power.

Steve Mann of Solent Coastguard said: ‘This weekend we have been expecting hurricane-force winds and we are urging people to take extra care.

‘The crashing waves are spectacular to watch but also extremely dangerous. HM Coastguard's advice is simple: don't take risks.

‘But if you do get into difficulty, or spot someone who might be in trouble, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.’

The police spokesman added: ‘All agencies remind people of the dangers of being at seashores in adverse weather, especially in view of the approaching severe weather conditions overnight. The advice is straightforward - stay clear.’

Hunt: Search and rescue teams have been looking for a photographer feared to have been washed off The Cobb wall at Lyme Regis in Dorset

A man in his fifties has also died after a tree fell on his car in high winds this morning, in Watford.  Police were called at 6.50am after a tree collapsed on a red Peugeot 307. The man, who was driving, died at the scene.

Meanwhile a man was found clinging to a rope at a Welsh port after his cries for help were heard early this morning.

The man - who was found hanging on to a rope dangling over the quayside at Holyhead, Anglesey - was described as 'lucky to be alive' after he was rescued by a coastguard team and the inshore lifeboat at 4.26am.

The man was handed over to paramedics and taken to hospital at Bangor, suffering with hypothermia.

In a separate incident, a double decker 
bus with passengers onboard has blown over on A1071 between Ipswich and 
Sudbury. Suffolk Police are currently on the scene.

Winds of more than 100mph have already left a
 trail of destruction today, bringing down trees and 
causing widespread structural damage.

Missing fisherman: Steven Stringer has not been seen since he was spotted at the riverbank to the River Kennet in Theale, near Reading, Berkshire

Surface
 water floods could strike much of England as the Met Office predicts up
 to 1.6in of rain could fall within six to nine hours overnight.

Elsewhere,
 search and rescue teams have been looking for a photographer feared to 
have been washed off The Cobb wall at Lyme Regis in Dorset.

A witness said a man was taking photos of the waves before he was swept out to sea. Coastguards carried out a search from 6pm on Saturday.

However, no-one has been reported missing. A coastguard helicopter and a RNLI lifeboat have now been stood down.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency urged anyone who was taking photographs on Saturday at that site between 5.30pm and 6pm to get in contact.

Meanwhile the hunt continues for a fisherman who is feared to have been swept away in a storm-swollen river in Berkshire.

Emergency services searched the river banks for clues to what happened to Steven Stringer, 62, from Basingstoke.

He was last seen fishing on the River Kennet at Theale, three miles upstream from where it flows into the Thames at Reading.

The
 last definite sighting of him was at 5pm on Friday by someone who saw 
him fishing where the Kennet flows close to Wigmore Lane in Theale.

Hurricane-force winds and torrential rain are battering southern England with gusts of almost 100mph ripping up trees, causing flash flooding and leaving at least 220,000 homes without power.

Millions of commuters have been left stranded and warned not to travel today unless it is essential, with at least 40 railway lines blocked, roads left impassable and hundreds of flights cancelled because of the most dangerous storm for years.
