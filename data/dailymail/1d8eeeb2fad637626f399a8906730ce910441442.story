The world's only known albino gorilla looked the way he did because of inbreeding, a new study has claimed. 

A vial of frozen blood taken from Snowflake the gorilla - who lived at Barcelona Zoo for 40 years until his death in 2003 - discovered he inherited the gene from his parents.

After tracing this gene, Spanish scientists discovered his parents were closely related - sharing 12 per cent of their DNA - which suggests they were uncle and niece.

Snowflake was born with albinism - a genetic mutation that causes a loss of colour pigments in skin and hair. He lived for 40 years before dying of skin cancer in 2003. Spanish scientists have discovered that his albino gene was 
inherited from this parents, who shared 12 per cent of DNA suggesting they were uncle and niece

Snowflake's celebrity status was enhanced when he featured on the Basement Jaxx album Rooty in 2001

Snowflake was famous for being the only known albino gorilla in the world.

A western lowland gorilla, he lived at the zoo until his death from skin cancer in 2003.

He was born in the wild with albinism - a genetic mutation that caused him to lack colour pigments in his skin and hair - but was captured by villagers in Equatorial Guinea in 1966.

His iconic colouring also put him on the cover of Basement Jaxx's 2001 album, Rooty.

Before he died, a vial of blood was taken and frozen to preserve it and the genome was sequenced in 2012.

As reported in the journal BMC Genomics, the researchers, led by Tomas Marques-Bonet at the University of Pompeu Fabra, in Spain, were then able to take this sequencing and compare it to non-albino gorilla genomes to find the cause of his genetic mutation. 

The scientists isolated Snowflake's albinism to a single gene called SLC45A2.

Snowflake inherited this mutation directly from his parents and when the researchers delved further into the DNA of his mother and father they discovered stretches of Snowflake's DNA from both parents were identical.

They were able to determine that his mother and father shared 12 per cent of their DNA and concluded that this likely made them uncle and niece. 

Albinism is a birth defect that causes humans and animals to be born without colour pigments in their skin, hair and eyes.

Albinism comes from the Latin word albus which means for 'white'.

It is also known as achromia.

Albinism is a is a birth defect that causes humans and animals to be born without colour pigments in their skin, hair and eyes.

It is caused by a lack of tyrosinase in their genes - an enzyme involved in the production of melanin.

Melanin is what causes skin colour and an increase in melanin is what causes skin to tan.

A
 human or animal with complete absence of melanin is called an albino, 
while someone with only a small amount of melanin is called an albinoid.

Lack of skin pigmentation makes people and animals more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers.

Snowflake the albino gorilla died of skin cancer in 2003.

Lack of skin pigmentation makes people and animals more susceptible to sunburn and skin cancers, which is what killed Snowflake a decade ago.

The findings are the first evidence of interbreeding in western lowland gorillas. 

However Marques-Bonet told LiveScience that some gorilla subspecies with small populations will mate with each other to preserve the species, or due to a lack of options. 

The study concludes: 'We envision that the analysis of whole genome data of endangered species will be a standard in future conservation and management studies and will make available relevant information that has been missed in previous studies.'

Spanish scientists were able to isolate the cause of Snowflake's albinism using genome sequencing. As shown in the left-hand chart, the SLC45A2 was the prominent gene that Snowflake had which the non-albino gorillas Kamlah and Kwan didn't. The right-hand chart shows where these genes overlapped in each gorilla
