A man has set several cars alight by smoking while allegedly stealing fuel from a tank - causing more than £60,000 worth of damage.

The 26-year-old is believed to have been trying to siphon petrol from one of the vehicles in a private car park in south Australia.

He then decided to light a cigarette - causing the fuel to burst into flames.

Blaze: A man has set several cars alight by smoking while allegedly stealing fuel from a tank in Millicent, south Australia. Above, CCTV footage captures the 26-year-old quickly leaving the scene, while surrounded by flames

Suspicious: The man is believed to have siphoned petrol from a car as he crouched in between two vehicles

Bad decision: He then decided to light a cigarette - causing the highly flammable fuel to burst into flames

Getaway: The man can be seen emerging from the cars, clutching something that has set alight - believed to be a container for the petrol. The surrounding vehicles in the privately-owned car park have also set ablaze

The shocking moment was captured on CCTV in Millicent, about 250 miles south-east of Adelaide, at around 11pm. 

Footage shows the man - wearing a dark top and trousers - crouching in between two vehicles in the car park.

He then emerges from the cars, while clutching something that has set alight - believed to be a container for the petrol.

He finally makes a quick exit from the car park as the surrounding vehicles also burst into flames. 

Shocking: A different CCTV camera captures the man crouching beside a vehicle in Angus McDonald's car park

Alert: Police were alerted to the blaze - which caused more than £60,000 worth of damage - at around 11.10pm

Response: The South Australian Country Fire Service were also called to the car park to tackle the fire

Police were called to the scene at 11.10pm after horrified locals spotted the blaze, according to News.com.au.

Officers searched the area and discovered the man hiding nearby with burns on his legs.

The South Australian Country Fire Service were also called to the car park to tackle the fire.

They successfully stopped it from spreading to a nearby building - but the damage to the cars alone has come to an estimated $100,000 (£60,000).

Arrest: The man, who is hidden by flames as he dashes away from the car park, was later arrested by police

However, car park owner Angus McDonald later told Channel Ten Eyewitness News that he had been 'very lucky'.

'About $110,000 worth of cars have been lost and there is a bit 
of damage to the walls,' he said.

'We were very lucky the building didn't catch fire because there are cars just over the other side of the wall.'

The man has been arrested and charged with arson and illegal interference with a motor vehicle.
