A mother-of-two has been left in a coma after having routine dental surgery in Hawaii to remove her wisdom teeth.

Kristen Tavares went into cardiac arrest on Monday, during a procedure to remove four teeth, and has been left with swelling on the brain.

The 23-year-old, who gave birth to her second son just three months ago, was described as fit and healthy, and had no medical conditions or allergies.

Ms Tavares' family are now left waiting for her to recover, as they struggle to care for her new baby and four-year-old son.

Operation: Dr John Stover was removing Tavares' wisdom teeth when she went into cardiac arrest

'We have to wait and see. They will run 
tests in the next few days or so but there is no timeline on what or 
when. It just takes time from here,' Chauncey Prudencio, her boyfriend, told Hawaii News Now.

'It's really hard especially for her 
family and just having our three-month-old son. It's very strenuous and 
stressful for everyone,' he said.

Dental staff at Dr John Stover's 
office in Hilo had to use a defibrillator to get Ms Tavares' heart 
beating again, and she was then air lifted to Maui, where hospital staff
 say she is unresponsive.

Her heart is also currently too weak for doctors to carry out any medical procedures, according to Opposing Views.

It is not clear what caused the healthy young woman to go into cardiac arrest, but a medical expert not involved with the case speculated that her airways could have become blocked.

'Statistically it's usually an airway issue. Perhaps a foreign body drops into the airway like a tooth, or a piece of gauze or perhaps the patient might vomit and get fluid up their airway and then down into their lungs,' Daniel Orr, of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Anesthesiology, said.

Dr Stover, who has three dental surgeries in Hawaii and is licensed to perform cosmetic surgery, has not yet commented on Ms Tavares' case.

Two complaints - from 2012 and 2013 - are outstanding against Dr Stover, who is allowed to use full anesthesia at his surgery.

However, two previous complaints about failure to comply with laws governing professional conduct were dismissed because of a lack of evidence, Hawaii News Now reported.

It is the second time this year that a dental patient has fallen into a coma. In January, three-year-old Finley Boyle died after going into a coma during a routine procedure.

The American Association for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons states that serious problems and deaths caused during routine dental treatment are rare, with a 1 in 365,000 chance of dying or suffering a brain injury while under anesthesia for dental work.
