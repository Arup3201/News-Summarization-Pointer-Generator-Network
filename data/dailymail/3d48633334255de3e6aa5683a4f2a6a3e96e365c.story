An inquest into the death of a six-year-old at a campsite, heard today her parents discovered the young girl 'unresponsive' in the tent they were sharing.

Isabelle Harris became ill at Holmsley campsite in the New Forest, Hampshire on Friday and suffered  a heart attack on the way to Southampton Hospital.

Histology and toxicology reports have now been ordered in an attempt to discover why the little girl died, the court in Southampton was told.

Tragic: An inquest into the death of six-year-old Isabelle Harris, heard today her parents discovered the young girl 'unresponsive' in the tent they were sharing

Coroner’s officer Howard Willis said that shortly after midnight Isabelle had been found 'unresponsive' in the tent.

When ambulance crews arrived they found her parents, Lee, 30, and Tracey, 40, trying to revive  Isabelle, their only child.

Paramedics took her to Southampton 
General Hospital, but she had a cardiac arrest on the journey and was pronounced dead on arrival at 1.16am on April 6.

'Concerns were expressed by a 
paediatric consultant about her condition, so it was decided that a post
mortem should take place with a Home Office pathologist,' Mr Willis explained.

Police initially reacted by arresting Isabelle’s parents on suspicion of murder, but released them later without charge.

Distraught: Some campers were so upset by the incident they decided to end their Easter weekend break early and go home

The youngster’s parents from Gosport, Hants, did not attend the brief hearing.

Mr Denson adjourned the hearing until a date to be fixed and said the case was now transferred to the Bournemouth coroner.

Police said the death had been a 'tragic incident.'

Mr and Mrs Harris released a 
statement which said they were devastated at the loss of the youngster 
who they described as 'our whole world.'

'No words are strong enough to 
describe how we feel at the moment. Isabelle was our whole world; 
everything we ever did was for her. She was a really special girl and 
this is a huge loss to everyone who knew her,' it said.

Probe: Officers make queries with campers after they were called to investigate the sudden death

Mr Denson warned the media not to draw 'premature conclusions' about the cause of death until the full inquest.

Last week the blue family tent, which sleeps up to six people, was guarded by police officers and the field was cordoned off.

Isabelle’s parents released a statement paying tribute to their daughter a few days after her death.

It read: ‘No words are strong enough to describe how we feel at the moment. Isabelle was our whole world; everything we ever did was for her.’

Despite being arrested, the couple thanked police, saying: ‘We thank them for the way they have treated us, being as open and honest as they can.’

Mr and Mrs Harris said they did not wish to speculate on the cause of their child’s death.

‘We want to find out why this happened and we would like to leave the police to get on with this,’ they said.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman defended the force’s decision to arrest Isabelle’s parents.

‘The arrests were necessary as a result of a report from experienced medical professionals,’ he said.

‘The results of a post-mortem examination conducted at Southampton General Hospital have indicated that there are no suspicious circumstances.’
