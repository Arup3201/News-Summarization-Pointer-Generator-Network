On a patch of hilly, barren scrubland in north-east Syria, kidnapped US journalist James Foley was beheaded by an Islamic State jihadist with an English accent.

A chilling video, broadcast online, offered virtually no clues as to the location except that the extremist was based in the town of Raqqa.

In an extraordinary piece of detective work, 35-year-old Eliot Higgins, who has investigated the Syrian conflict, may have pinpointed the spot where the reporter was killed.

Mr Higgins explains there are two breaks in the rocks visible here either side of Mr Foley and his captor

According to Mr Higgins' analysis, this is the layout of the area in which Mr Foley was killed

The video showing the killing of Mr Foley is believed to have been filmed somewhere near Raqqa

But Mr Higgins, who blogs under the name Brown Moses, is not working for the security services… he is a Leicester-based citizen journalist who used just satellite imagery, traditional maps and evidence from the video to narrow down the place of death.

Even though Mr Higgins admits there is ‘not a great deal of information’ in the video he points out some information can be gleaned.

The killing was filmed in what appears to be a hilly area, with barely any plants or grass, and in the distance there is green plain below the hills.

Shadows on the video suggest it was filmed in the morning, with the camera pointing northwards – suggesting the location was in the uplands south of Raqqa.

Studying the video, the blogger surmised it was filmed on an area of raised ground, close to a dusty a track and leading to a break in the rocks, to the left of Mr Foley as the camera looks at him. There is another small break in the rocks to the right.

In the distance there appear to be no obvious structures beyond what may be trees or small individual buildings.

These images show roads that help identify the location in the background of the video

Satellite map images appear to support Mr Higgins: they show a track entrance to the area, with a rock outcrop be partly covering the entryway, as it does in the video.

Based on that information it appears that this is the approximate positions of what is seen in the video.

The blogger also notes that when the camera films from a certain location on the outcrop, trees are visible in the distance - a possible match to the trees on the road running to the north-west. No buildings can be seen.

Mr Higgins said: ‘Having reviewed locations along the hills south of Raqqa this appears to be the only location which fits what little information is available in the video.

‘Along the hills this appears to be the most isolated spot with any sort of road access, with most other areas with road access appearing to have structures that would be visible in the video.

‘Based on all available information we can say that at the very minimum the James Foley video was filmed in the hills south of Raqqa, and likely at the location shown above, supporting the claims that Raqqa is the possible location of the remaining hostages.’
