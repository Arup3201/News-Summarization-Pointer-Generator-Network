Eating raw fish is a foodie trend that has been exported from the East and adopted across much of the world with open arms.

But eating live octopus might be taking things a little too far.

Not for these brave visitors to a food festival in Seoul, South Korea, however.

Making most people squirm at the thought, these willing participants pulled wriggling octopus out from a bucket and then tried to force the sticky creatures into their mouths.

Tentacles sucking onto fingers, lips and cheeks, it proved to be quite tricky to get any of the eight legs into their mouths.

But eventually, hungry - we assume starved - visitors to this local food festival started taking chunks out of the poor creatures' many legs.

Chewing the sticky writhing limbs, they proved it was possible to eat octopus if there was ever the need.

Hungry? Any hint of hunger may turn to nausea at the thought of satisfying a grumbling stomach with this sticky squirming meal

Get in there: Trying to get the wriggling octopus into the mouth in the first place often proved to be difficult, but some clearly found it easier than others...

Whether or not this fad will catch on, remains to be seen. It certainly wouldn't make a great first date dinner.

But in Seoul, people seemed happy to give it a go.

The country's Donghae city holds a Squid Festival, every September, attracting up to 70,000 visitors.

People can catch them with their bare hands, and take part in a ceremony that celebrates the local food staple.Â 

Suckers: The octopus put up a good fight sucking onto anything, everything, and each other

Legless: But the hungry visitors proved too great a match for the octopus; this poor one looked like it had already lost some of it's legs  before this man chomped on one of the few remaining

Competitions include a 'squid treatment contest', and a 'raw slicing contest'.

The festival also coincided with South Korea's Supreme Court ruling today that a man be acquitted for the murder of his girlfriend, after he argued that she choked on live octopus.

The court upheld the acquittal of the 32-year-old man who had been sentenced to life imprisonment.

The long-running case, fuelled by accusations of police incompetence, had received enormous media and public attention in South Korea.

'Indirect, circumstantial evidence is insufficient to support the charge that the accused killed the woman by suffocating her,' the court said in a statement, upholding an April ruling by an appeals court.

The man, identified only as Kim, checked into a motel in Incheon City near Seoul with his girlfriend in April 2010 after buying two live octopuses from a local restaurant, the court heard.
