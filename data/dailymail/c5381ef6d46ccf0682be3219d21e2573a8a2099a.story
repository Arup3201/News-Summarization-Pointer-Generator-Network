La Liga side Valencia say they will not use a new version of its bat logo that comic book maker DC Comics had opposed for being too similar to its Batman symbol.

Valencia had applied for a copyright for a new design of the bat that forms part of its crest, but it has since decided to discard it after DC Comics 'presented its opposition to the request.'

The club says 'there does not exist a lawsuit by DC Comics,' but the club no longer has 'plans to use' the new design.

Spanish side Valencia have had a bat on their team crest since their formation in 1919

However DC Comics say they copied their batman badge and Valencia will no longer use their version

Batman and Robin, pictured here being played by Adam West and Burt Ward in the 1966 movie centred around the comic book, are popular characters

California-based company DC Comics, who are owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment, were formed in 1934.

Well-known comic book characters such as Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman all fall under their umbrella.

The bat has formed part of Valencia's crest since 1922, while the Batman comic first appeared in 1939.
