Nos 50-41: Includes Albert Luque, David Ngog and Claudio Pizarro. 

Nos 40-31: Includes Rolando Bianchi, Helder Postiga and Andriy Voronin.

The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry, but unfortunately there have also been some major disappointments.

Whether failing to justify their huge price tag, or just incapable of hitting a barn door, there have been some dreadful forwards. As we build-up to the return of the Premier League following the international break. Sportsmail runs you through Nos 30-21 of the worst strikers to have ever played in the division... do you agree?

30) Diego Forlan (Manchester United) 

He may have been a cult hero with Manchester United fans following his £6.9million transfer from Argentine club Independiente in January 2002, but the Uruguayan simply did not take to life in the Premier League - and it took him an incredible 27 games to get off the mark!

It seems strange that such a talented footballer - who has excelled for Uruguay, Villarreal and Atletico Madrid, among others - struggled so desperately at Old Trafford, but sometimes the face simply does not fit.

Rather amusingly, Forlan was told to wear longer studs in order to get greater grip in the pitch but Sir Alex Ferguson discovered he was failing to follow orders and he was promptly marched towards the exit door in 2004 having scored just 10 in 63 Premier League games.

29) Sergei Rebrov (Tottenham Hotspur)

Tottenham Hotspur supporters thought they were getting the real deal when Rebrov arrived for £11m from Dynamo Kiev in May 2000 - but they didn't anticipate how much of a struggle it would be for Ukrainian to adjust to the English style of play.

Despite being the man who was supposed to bridge the gap to north London rivals Arsenal, all Rebrov managed in four years at White Hart Lane was 10 goals in 60 Premier League matches as he was frozen out by Glenn Hoddle.

He moved to West Ham United, then in the Championship, and netted just once at Upton Park before returning to his native country where he has gone on to become the highest scorer in the history of the Ukrainian Premier League.

28) Andreas Lund (Wimbledon)

Just as everything was going down the swanny for Wimbledon and they thought it couldn't possibly get any worse they only went and splashed £2.5m to bring Andreas Lund from Molde in 2000.

The Norwegian forward's striking ability, much like the unfortunately-doomed club's future, was non-existent and he managed just two Premier League goals in 12 games.

To be fair those strikes came against Chelsea and Arsenal, but 6ft 2in Lund's lack of mobility and shyness in front of goal meant he was quickly shipped back to Norway and Dons fans no longer had to sigh whenever the big man received the ball.

27) Andreas Andersson (Newcastle United)

Newcastle United fans are lucky to have witnessed the likes of Alan Shearer, Peter Beardsley and Les Ferdinand grace the St James' Park pitch down the years - but they were also forced to endure the painful experience of watching Andreas Andersson try to be a Premier League striker.

Andersson arrived on Tyneside from AC Milan for £2m in 1998 but the Swedish forward was utterly hopeless. He scored just four Premier League goals in 27 appearances and was sent back to Swedish side AIK after only one season in England.

He was so bad in fact that Newcastle fans only really remember him for the blond locks and ridiculous hairband he sported.

26) Martin Dahlin (Blackburn Rovers)

The 1993 Swedish Player of the Year moved to Lancashire for £2.5m from Roma in 1997 having bagged 10 goals in 19 games while on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach the season before.

Highly-praised during the 1992 European Championship for Sweden, Dahlin's time at Blackburn Rovers was decimated by a training ground injury - which eventually forced him to retire - and he is remembered as a big disappoitnment.

A mere four goals arrived in 27 Premier League appearances during his two years at Blackburn before he was forced to hang up his boots. His is one of the sadder stories.

25) Michele Padovano (Crystal Palace)

When a £1.7m striker (a big sum for Palace in 1997) fails to appear in more than two consecutive games, it tells you all you really need to know about their time in south London.

Padovano signed for  Palace from Juventus - or more accurately their reserve side - and he arrived in England hopelessly out of shape and woefully out of form.

When the Eagles were relegated, the Italian flew off to Metz having scored just once in 12 Premier League matches - only to return to reportedly collect the £1m worth of wages he believed the club, who were battling against financial meltdown, owed him. 

Maybe he should have thought about scoring more and keeping Palace up - then he may even have received a pay rise!

24) Lee Dong-gook (Middlesbrough)

The South Korean was so hopeless he couldn't get anywhere near the Middlesbrough squad for four months, and this at a time when they were beginning to really struggle in the top flight.

Lee moved to Boro on a free transfer from Pohang Steelers in 2006 and during his 18 months on Teesside it appears he set about attempting to ensure he would be on the list of the Premier League's worst ever strikers...

Here's how you sum up Lee: 23 league appearances, zero goals. He was simply dreadful.

23) Viorel Moldovan (Coventry City)

The Romanian cost a hefty £3.25m from Grasshoppers in 1998 and, during his exceptionally short stay in the west Midlands, he proved to be an extreme pain in the backside for Coventry City boss Gordon Strachan.

Moldovan allegedly criticised Strachan's capabilities as a manager and also the qualities of the rest of his side - forgetting the adage that people in glass houses should not throw stones.

He netted just twice in 10 Premier League appearances before heading for Turkey - much to the relief of Strachan and Sky Blues fans - just months after signing.

22) Andrea Silenzi (Nottingham Forest)

One of the very first Italians to grace the Premier League, Silenzi is not quite remembered in the same sort of bracket as the likes of Gianfranco Zola or Gianluca Vialli.

'Big Brush' Silenzi arrived at Nottingham Forest for £1.8m in 1995 from Torino as a 6ft 3in striker with a big reputation yet he looked anything but a player who could play up front. He was slow, lackadaisical and generally inept around the park.

His then-astronomical wages of £30,000 a month did not guarantee him hitting the target and when he left having failed to score even once in his 12 Premier League appearances, manager Dave Bassett - who allegedly tore up the forward's contract - declared: 'The whole business turned into a complete fiasco.' That's certainly one word for it...

21) Milton Nunez (Sunderland)

The story of Milton Nunez at Sunderland is a classic cautionary tale.

With the Black Cats believing there were acquiring a £1.5m signing from Uruguayan top-flight side Nacional Montevideo, they pursued the deal for Nunez. In actual fact, they were signing the forward from a Third Division team - Uruguay Montevideo - meaning the difference in quality was quite large...

The Honduran was on Wearside from 1999 to 2001 but played only once in the Premier League - for a grand total of 44 minutes - and needless to say he failed to score.

Sunderland took legal action against Nunez, his agent and Uruguay Montevideo and agreed to settle out of court so they did gain back the majority of the fee.

They will always have to live with the sheer embarrassment, however.
