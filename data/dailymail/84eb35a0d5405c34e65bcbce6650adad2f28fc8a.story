An English teacher died on Christmas Day after being beaten to death by her bodybuilder boyfriend who then sped off in his car, police claim.

Prudence Hockley, 55, of Seattle, Washington, died after allegedly being beaten up outside her home by 48-year-old Johnnie Lee Wiggins.

They had built up a relationship over their love of fitness. She moved to the U.S. from New Zealand in 1978 and had a 13-year-old daughter.

The incident began when Ms Hockley went outside her house at 11pm on Christmas Eve to speak with a friend, police told KOMO News.

A thump was heard by witnesses and Ms Hockley’s 13-year-old daughter raced outside to find her mother unconscious, police said.

Neighbors said they remember a man walking away from the Woodinville High School teacher and driving off in a vehicle.

‘It just is gut-wrenching, and it's so unfair,’ her friend Jill Jeakins told KOMO News. ‘People have been robbed of a wonderful person.’

Wiggins was reportedly on supervised parole for crimes committed in Georgia and assaulted a corrections officer in Washington state in May.

‘I think we were all pretty shook up,’ her neighbour Miranda Meyer told KOMO News. ‘There was a lot of activity on Christmas Eve.’

Professional bodybuilder Wiggins is 6'3" and weighs 260lbs.

‘Ms Hockley was an extraordinary teacher - passionate about learning, reading and writing,’ Woodinville High School principal Kurt Criscione said.

Although the incident happened on Christmas Eve, police did not release details of it until after an arrest was made on Wednesday.

Twenty homicides have now taken place in Seattle this year and at least six were put down to domestic violence, reported the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

Ms Hockley joined the school in 1997 and had studied at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand and the University of Washington in Seattle.
