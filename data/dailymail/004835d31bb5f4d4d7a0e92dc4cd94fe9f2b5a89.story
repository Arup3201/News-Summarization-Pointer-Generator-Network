For the crowds who gathered at Sandringham to see the Royal Family attend church yesterday morning, there was one very important person missing – Prince George.

Some shouted ‘where’s the baby’ as his beaming parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, arrived hand in hand for the traditional Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene Church.

The answer? At home playing with the wrapping paper.

Well-wishers: One cheeky member of the crowd shouted 'where's the baby' as Kate arrived for the service

Popular: Around 3,000 well-wishers gathered outside the church to watch them arrive 

Kate, who wore a tartan Alexander McQueen coat, made the comment to wellwisher Cicely Howard, 75.

Miss
 Howard, from Great Yarmouth, said: ‘She told me he was having a lovely 
day but was more interested in the wrapping paper than the presents.’

And William told the crowd: ‘We’ve had a good morning with George and I can’t wait until next year when he’s bigger.’

The
 duke and duchess were among around 30 members of the royal family who 
celebrated Christmas on the Queen’s Norfolk estate – far more than in 
recent years.

As they 
arrived at church they were accompanied by Prince Harry, sporting a 
trimmed version of the beard he grew during his expedition to the 
Antarctic earlier this month, as well as Prince Charles and the Duchess 
of Cornwall.

Zara Phillips,
 who is just weeks away from giving birth to her first child, travelled 
with her grandmother, the Queen, in her Bentley to the church door. 
Normally it is the Countess of Wessex, Prince Edward’s wife, who is 
afforded that honour.

Zara’s husband, Mike Tindall, walked alongside his brother-in-law, Peter Phillips.

Despite
 his recent ill health, Prince Philip, 92, led his family on the brisk 
half-mile walk from Sandringham House to the church. He spent the summer
 recuperating after exploratory surgery on his abdomen.

The Queen opted for a burnt orange coat with a black fur hat and matching gloves for the public service, at 11am.

But
 for a private family service earlier in the day she wrapped up warmly 
in a long brown fur coat. Kate was also in a different outfit, choosing a
 cream overcoat with a red tartan shawl.

While George was missing from 
the morning’s events, he was the star of the show when it came to the 
Queen’s Christmas address at 3pm.

During
 the speech, recorded at Buckingham Palace earlier this month, the Queen
 made it clear how much joy her first great-grandson had given her, even
 allowing unseen footage from his christening to be included in the 
broadcast.

She spoke at 
length about how the birth of a baby helps people to think about the 
future with ‘renewed happiness and hope’.

She said: ‘Here at home my own
 family is a little larger this Christmas.

‘As
 so many of you will know, the arrival of a baby gives everyone the 
chance to contemplate the future with renewed happiness and hope.

‘For the new parents, life will never be quite the same again.’

There
 was also a rare reference to her eldest son, Prince Charles, who has 
begun to take on more official duties on her behalf.

Last month he stood
 in for his mother for the first time at the bi-annual heads of 
government meeting, which the Queen took the unusual step of referring 
to in her speech yesterday. Footage of the event was also shown.

She
 spoke about how the ‘Commonwealth can offer us a fresh view of life’, 
adding: ‘My son Charles summed this up at the recent meeting in Sri 
Lanka.

‘He spoke of the Commonwealth’s “family ties” that are a source of encouragement  to many.’

Brothers: A bearded Prince Harry grinned to the waiting crowds, while Prince William also chatted to onlookers

Gathering: heavily pregnant Zara Phillips looked relaxed and happy in a berry-coloured coat as she stood with her husband Mike Tindall

Cheerful: The Queen smiled as she accepted flowers and a piece of origami from the public

Seasons greetings: The Queen accessorised her orange coat with fur-trimmed gloves and a hat, while Zara Phillips looked festive in her red coat and hat

Appearance: There was a rare public outing for the Earl of Wessex's 10-year-old daughter Lady Louise

Family gathering: Lady Louise outside the church with her parents and cousin Prince William

She
 later spoke about George’s christening, as footage was shown of the 
royal family posing for official photographs to mark the occasion.

The
 Duchess of Cambridge can be heard coaxing her baby son to look at 
celebrity portrait photographer Jason Bell, saying ‘Good boy, George.’

The Queen said: ‘As with all who are christened, George was baptised into a joyful faith of Christian duty and service.

‘After
 the christening, we gathered for the traditional photograph. It was a 
happy occasion, bringing together four generations.’
