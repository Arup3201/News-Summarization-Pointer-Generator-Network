Scotland Yard was today asked to investigate fresh claims of law-breaking over union influence in the Labour party.

The scandal deepened today as the Tories called on the Met Police to investigate allegations of orchestrated behaviour by Unite in Ilford North and Lewisham Deptford.

Ed Miliband has insisted the problems which have plunged his leadership into crisis were confined to Falkirk, but there is a growing sense that union domination of the party is more widespread.

Pressure: Ed Miliband is facing the biggest test of his leadership since beating his brother David for the top Labour job in September 2010

The Labour leader is preparing to give a major speech tomorrow on overhauling the party’s links with its union paymasters, but is expected to stop short of severing ties completely.

He has been warned he must win an ‘ideological battle’ with his union paymasters to avoid political oblivion.

Unite was accused of trying to fix the selection process for Falkirk’s parliamentary candidate to benefit Karie Murphy, a close friend of Unite general secretary Len McCluskey.

Police have launched a fraud inquiry over claims that people were signed up as Labour party members by Unite – without their knowledge – so they could vote for Miss Murphy.

But Labour bosses have also received complaints about Unite’s activities in several other constituencies.

Today Bob Neill, a Tory party vice-chairman, called on Scotland Yard to investigate claims of ‘fraudulent behaviour’ in two London constituencies.

But the Labour party dismissed the move as a 'silly political stunt'.

Police: Tory vice-chairman Bob Neill has written to Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, asking Scotland Yard to investigate union behaviour in two London seats

In a letter to Met Commissioner 
Bernard Hogan-Howe, Mr Neill said: ‘I am sure that you will be aware of 
the current police investigation taking place in Scotland, into the 
alleged fraud committed by the Unite trade union in Falkirk.

'It is alleged that Unite in Falkirk were signing up their own members to the Labour Party without their consent and knowledge.

‘I
am concerned that this instance is just the tip of the iceberg, as 
Unite themselves admit they are targeting another 40 Labour Party 
parliamentary selections for similar treatment. Senior Labour Party 
sources have also confessed that the problems go wider than just 
Falkirk.

‘In particular there are two London constituencies of particular concern: Ilford North and Lewisham Deptford.’

What is going on?There
is a battle for control of the Labour party between leader Ed Miliband 
and the unions, most significantly Unite and its general secretary Len 
McCluskey.

What has happened?The
row was triggered by allegations that Unite paid for dozens of people 
to join the local party in Falkirk - possibly without their knowledge - 
in order to swing the vote and ensure its preferred candidate Karie 
Murphy won. It has now been suggested that union influence in constituencies goes beyond Falkirk, including two seats in London: Ilford North and Lewisham Deptford.’Why does this matter?The
idea of Labour being in hoc to the unions remains toxic for many 
voters. Unite has given more than £8million to the Labour party 
since Mr Miliband became leader and has boasted of its intention to 
secure a more left wing agenda. He only beat his brother for the Labour 
leadership in 2010 because he won the support of unions.

He claims that in Ilford North, Unite offered their members free Labour Party membership in exchange for attending a meeting with General Secretary Len McCluskey.

‘Given that this constituency appears on a Unite target list along with Falkirk, I believe that the circumstances of this membership recruitment merit investigation’, Mr Neill added.

The letter also points to claims from a London Labour activist Mandy Richards that Unite is ‘bankrolling’ a number of ‘orchestrated’ campaigns.

She singles out Lewisham Deptford for 'special attention'.

Mr Neill says the activities, if true, could be in breach of the Fraud Act 2006 under the terms of ‘false misrepresentation’ or fraud by abuse of position.

He adds: ‘I would be very grateful for any assistance that you can offer in investigating this deeply troubling matter.’

Labour insiders had been keen to stress that problems with Unite's practices in Labour constituency parties was contained to Falkirk alone.

A Labour source said: 'This is a silly political stunt.

'We have no evidence of possible criminal behaviour anywhere outside Falkirk. If Bob Neill has, he should produce it. If he has not, he should stop wasting police time.'

But the suggestion that it could be more widespread, and the involvement of Britain's biggest police force, means the scandal could spread far beyond Mr Miliband's control.

Tomorrow, the Labour leader will outline plans to change his party’s rules and limit the power of the unions. 

Insiders say Mr Miliband is examining 
whether to hold open primary elections – which would let the general 
public elect parliamentary candidates – as well as plans to speed up the
selection process, leaving unions less time to mobilise.

He also plans 
to make it more difficult for unions to sign up new party members.

Leaked Unite documents show it sought to exploit rules that let unions 
pay new members’ fees to secure 41 candidacies.  Labour has since 
scrapped the scheme.

Party insiders said concerns have 
already been raised about the union’s activities in Chester and 
Brighton, Glasgow, Crawley, East Dunbartonshire, Paisley, Garston and 
Halewood and Ilford North.

Unite has also been accused of plotting to 
oust shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander.

Lord Reid, the former home secretary, said Unite leader Len McCluskey wanted 
to take Labour ‘back to the 80s’ – and that Mr Miliband must move 
swiftly to make sure the party survives.

He said Mr Miliband faces ‘an ideological
battle’ with ‘those who want to take Labour back to the 70s and 80s, as
Len McCluskey does – when we represented the sectional voice, the weak 
echo of every industrial demand of the trade unions’.

‘I
am in no doubt that the leader of Unite wants to impose an ideological 
direction on the Labour Party that would lead us into political 
oblivion,’ he added.
