Britain has lost her empire ... again. Once, Britannia ruled the airwaves, with dramas that were the envy of the world’s broadcasters.

But that’s ancient history, and this week the Emmy awards in Los Angeles delivered fresh humiliation. American television shows swept the board, and they deserved to.

That’s because, in the States, television is revelling in a new golden age. Far more than cinema or literature, TV is the greatest art form of the era.

U.S. dramas such as the political drama House Of Cards, Breaking Bad and Game Of Thrones are thrilling and unmissable. Modern Family is laugh-out-loud funny.

But while America is embracing this golden age, we’re still trying to resurrect the old one.

Back in the Seventies, the BBC was one of the best reasons not to emigrate. We watched innovative dramas such as I, Claudius and Colditz, and brilliant comedies like Porridge and Fawlty Towers, with no adverts, for the price of the licence fee.

We pitied the Americans, we really did. Their shows were fragmented by commercial breaks that made viewing impossible. The only successful programmes on U.S. television were chat-shows and quizzes, which could be endlessly broken up.

But today, U.S. programmes are paid for in a different way. Subscription channels via cable and the internet have empowered producers to create intricate worlds over several seasons. They’ve drawn viewers into the most improbable and addictive scenarios, such as True Detective, a gruesomely compelling murder mystery starring Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, or The Good Wife, about a lawyer’s wife trying to piece her life back together after a sex scandal.

Cleverly, the big hits win over their audience in stages.

First, they screen to a small, dedicated fan-base of subscribers who have paid for access to the production through cable channels such as Home Box Office (HBO) or streaming internet services such as Netflix.

That generates excitement on social media, so that when the DVD box-set is released, millions are ready to binge-watch, consuming a dozen episodes over a couple of nights.

Finally, the series is syndicated to TV channels worldwide. The result is a triple wave of income that funds the next unlikely but visionary hit.

The BBC business model is arthritic by comparison. Entire floors of executives maul a concept before it is approved, injecting blandness and removing risk. That’s why most Beeb programmes are either called The Great British something-or-other, or The Secret Life Of you-name-it . . . safe, formulaic titles.

During his visit to Washington, Labour leader Ed Miliband took President Obama a present of a classic BBC box-set — State Of Play, the newspaper drama starring Bill Nighy and John Simm.

It is under six hours long. However, the Obamas’ favourite viewing includes Boardwalk Empire and Breaking Bad, which both stretch to more than 50 episodes. Nothing could illustrate more clearly how far UK television has lapsed behind.

To make it worse, if you want to catch up on shows that swept the Emmys this week — with the exception of the splendid Sherlock, which picked up awards for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson — don’t expect to find them on the Beeb. You’ll have to pay extra subscriptions to Sky, Netflix and more.

So is this an international golden age, or do you have to be American to appreciate the shows?

The answer is that you don’t need a Green Card, the all-purpose U.S. entry ticket, but you do need patience: just as when you start to read a blockbuster novel, the rewards don’t flow within the first few scenes. Many British viewers who gave up quickly on Breaking Bad complained it was too cynical to be entertaining. It’s the story of Walt, a failed chemistry teacher, in a stale marriage, broke and dying of cancer.

What begins as an attempt to fund his healthcare, by using his chemistry knowledge to make and sell the drug crystal meth, turns into an act of vengeance against the world.

Actor Bryan Cranston won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor, and the show won for outstanding drama, with another Emmy going to Cranston’s co-star, Aaron Paul.

Viewers who stuck with Breaking Bad beyond the opening episodes know that it becomes psychologically compelling.

This summer, my 20-year-old son persuaded his mother, a fan of Mr Selfridge and EastEnders, to watch it with him. Within days, they were gulping down episodes in twos and threes, quoting the dialogue and obsessively connecting the clues.

This slow-burning addiction is typical of the best U.S. dramas.

The pattern was set by The Sopranos, the tale of a New Jersey gangster boss and his family, launched by HBO in 1999.

In his book The Revolution Was Televised, American TV critic Alan Sepinwall argues: ‘The Sopranos is the one that made the world realise something special was happening on television. It rewrote the rules.’

Even if Britain is no longer making many of the best shows in the world, at least lots of the best U.S. shows are crammed with English talent.

Take, for instance, Fargo, from the FX cable channel, which won the Emmy for best mini-series, and exemplifies the current superiority of TV over cinema. An Oscar-winning movie from almost 20 years ago became a mesmerising ten-part fable of murder in the snowy wastes of Minnesota.

Martin Freeman played the central character, a timid insurance agent who, like Walt, turns into a criminal monster.

Game Of Thrones is packed from dungeon to ramparts with British thespians. Sean Bean opened the show, as its battle-hardened hero Eddard Stark, before the conniving Charles Dance took centre-stage as the chief puppet-master in the fantasy kingdom of Westeros.

That’s not to mention Dame Diana Rigg, who won this year’s Emmy for outstanding guest actress, as the grandmother of a scheming queen.

Without this array of brilliant Brits, U.S. drama would be impoverished, and the new golden age would lack much of its glitter.

For the most part, the same cannot be said for British writers, though one notable exception is Armando Iannucci, creator of the acerbically brilliant Westminster satire The Thick Of It. He’s transported his political nous to the States, and this week the female star of his White House comedy Veep won her third Emmy in a row.

So why has it proved impossible for so many UK producers to match their rivals across the Atlantic?

The moribund licence fee is only part of the problem — after all, Sherlock did net a brace of Emmys. But it bypassed the commissioning process that neuters and homogenises so much British drama.

Mark Gatiss and co-writer Steven Moffat had the clout to make Sherlock the way they wanted it — though any fan who has seen the original pilot episode, included as an extra in the box-set, knows how close the show came to being converted into the Beeb’s standard output of bland and sterile fudge.

Despite the golden era of American television, Stevens says that British dramas like Broadchurch (pictured are the cast of the ITV series including David Tennant, centre) are real UK contributions to the 'new golden age'

As ITV drama does not go through the same centralised process, individual brilliance has a better chance of surviving. That has given us the two other real UK contributions to the new golden age — Downton Abbey and Broadchurch.

Both were conceived by writers with a vivid and distinctive vision. Julian Fellowes’ nostalgic sense of a lost England, and Broadchurch writer Chris Chibnall’s insight into provincial secrets, were allowed free rein. The result was masterful television, a match for anything American cable giants could offer.

There are signs Auntie is belatedly recognising the importance of a creative force that moulds a production. Sally Wainwright, who had a surprise triumph with Last Tango In Halifax, was allowed to make Happy Valley without too much interference: the result was stunning drama.

Hugo Blick, whose Palestine-Israeli tragedy The Honourable Woman concluded last week on BBC2, was given freedom as a writer and director. And producer Jed Mercurio’s police drama Line Of Duty also bore the hallmark of a series forged by a master craftsman.

After lagging so badly for years, the Beeb might finally be learning its lesson. But as the Emmys humiliation emphasised, Britain has a lot of catching up to do.
