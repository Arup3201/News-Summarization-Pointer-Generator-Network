Albert Podell's passport stamp collection probably trumps yours.

The former Playboy editor, author and adventurer has travelled to each of the world's 196 countries over a period of fifty years. 

Podell, now 78, has encountered everything from run ins with guerillas in Yemen to being attacked by flying crabs in Algeria and being interrogated by Cuban secret police.

'Aged six, I started to collect postage stamps, and where the other kids specialised in certain countries, I wanted a stamp from every country in the world. Getting a passport stamps from every one may have been inspired by that,' he tells Mail Online Travel. 

'Those little coloured bits of perforated paper also instilled in me a fascination with travel because I wanted to see the lands where all the objects, people, and places depicted on those stamps came from.'

The Huli Wigmen of Papua New Guinea spend several years under the supervision of a wig master to grow these huge wigs, says Podell

'My parents were poor and could not afford to travel, which led me to resolve early on that there was more to life than hanging around in one city forever.

The author has been driven by wanderlust ever since: When he was 28 he led an expedition around the world the set the record for the longest direct, non-repetitive automobile journey ever made around the earth.

And growing older spurred him on.  'As I moved past middle age, I still wanted to do one grand and glorious travel venture, to go out with a bang rather than a whimper, and, after I realized that I had been to 90 nations, I decided that I just might be able to visit every one of the 196 countries during my allotted years,' he says.

His travels have taken him to the furthest flung corners of the globe, allowing him to meet some of the world's most colourful characters: In his book, Around the World in Fifty Years, released this month, he fondly remembers a flamboyant camel driver; a voodoo priest and a deaf and mute Japanese badminton Olympian.

In the course of his travels Podell has eaten:

Armadillo - in the hills of Grenada

Zebra - in Kenya 

Fish lips, fish eyes, fungus soup, duck's feet, roasted duck gizzard, braised jellyfish, spicy soup of shredded intestines and organ meats boiled in blood,  sea cucumber - in China

Kangaroo, ostrich, emu, and Moreton Bay Bugs - in Australia 

Poisonous ugu sushi - in Japan

Possum pie - various Caribbean islands 

Guinea pig - in Peru, Bolivia

Crocodile in Africa and Australia

Gnu, antelope, eland, gazelle, springbok, steenbok, klipspringer, kudu, nyala, and oryx - in sub-Saharan Africa 

Pigeon  - in France and Morocco

Iguana - in Central America

Blood sausage - in Colombia and Germany

Smashed chicken infused with sugar and covered with ice cream - in Turkey 

Snake - various places  

Horse - in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan

Pig's blood porridge, caramelized fish hatchlings, lotus root salad, steamed blood cockles, caramelized pork belly and Mekong rat - in Vietnam

Toasted leafcutter ants, oven-baked tarantulas, waxworm potato fritters, bees, beetles, crickets, worms, caterpillars, scorpions, wax moth larvae, and grubs - in many places, and not always intentionally

 

Podell's adventures have seen him trapped Cape Buffalo and crocodiles in Botswana; unable to furnish the required proof to the Egyptian police that he was not Jewish; being unable to prove to the Cuban secret police that he was not CIA and been thrown in jail in Baghdad when a con artist pretended he had hit him with a land cruiser.

He lists the most hair-raising moments as: being stranded on Kiribati, pick pocketed in Tunis and robbed of much equipment in Algiers and the Khyber Pass, nearly lynched in East Pakistan, almost drowned in Costa Rica, detained by the police in Kinshasa and Hargeisa, jailed in Baghdad, attacked by the flying crabs in Algeria, breaking three ribs and ripping flesh and tearing rotator cuffs in many lands.   

With an accommodation budget of around £7 per night, the writer has unrolled his sleeping bag 'at border posts, roadsides, jungles, glaciers, airport floors, and in hostels,  tents, trailers, trees, teepees, campers, cars, caravansaries, desert dugouts, and flea-bag motels alternately sweating and freezing; dodging dengue- fever mosquitoes by day and malarial ones by night.' 

'I preferred to eat from open-air stands where I could see the cooking, and the dishwashing, and how healthy the chef looked. Here Gabon'

Modes of transport have varied. Podell explains that he's travelled by 'ancient Third World airplanes; leaky, overloaded foreign ferries; broken-down, jam-packed bush taxis driven on rutted roads at 100 mph by wild kids who never passed a driving test; pole-pushed canoes loaded with 40 people and 20 sheep.'

He's ridden atop a cotton truck in Uzbekistan, camels, donkeys, horses, elephants, rickshaws, carts, wheelbarrows, and tuk-tks, as well as 'Motorcycles,  catamarans, hydrofoils, dugout canoes and the Queen Mary. In short, almost anything that transports people, except an ambulance, thank God.' 

And of course, Podell has been privy to some of the world's rarest - and sometimes unappealing - culinary offerings.

'Among the more memorable  was an anteater Steve [his companion] and I found recently run over on a road in Panama. Not wanting to waste a good source of protein, we chopped it up, added salt and pepper, wished we had a box of Roadkill Helper, roasted it over a campfire, and it tasted… awful, like a burger marinated in formic acid,' he says. 

'Rats are, in contrast – and after you overcome any squeamish cultural bias - rather tasty, especially the big boys eaten in Africa, where they're called 'grass cutters,' an appealing appellation doubtless bestowed by the branding consultant who renamed the Patagonian toothfish as 'Chilean sea bass' and the slimefish as 'orange roughy.' The locals skin the rodents, split them down the middle, spread them out flat, and roast or grill them. Each tastes exactly like what it ate. If it lived in a cane field, it tastes like sugar.

'Unfortunately, the elephant dung beetle I ate in Kenya smelled exactly like what it ate, but I overcame this olfactory impediment with a liberal application of insect repellant under my nose.' 

'And then there was the pulsating brain of that live monkey in Hong Kong...'

'The residences and dwelling places made me wonder if it is fair or necessary to have such wide disparity between the haves and the have-not around the world,' says Podell

Podell met thousands of colourful characters on his travels, including a prostitute in Berlin, left, and a happy Haitian man, right

What did he learn on the road? 'We all read about the economic inequality between the rich and poor nations, and about the great wealth gap between the rich and poor people within nations, but until you actually see people – one third of the world, in fact – trying to manage to live on less than two dollars a day, it does not hit home. 

'Unless you are there, it is almost impossible for us to imagine what it is like to have to provide shelter, food, clothing, medical care, and all the other necessities of life on two dollars a day.'

'With the exception of the few truly weird countries (like North Korea and those in the midst of famine or war) people around the world are pretty much the same in terms of their love for their families and children, their desire to be happy, and their hope to live in peace and have a better life.

'The main differences I observed were that people in the very poor countries were far more able to get along on less than citizens of the rich countries ever could.'

'Gun-toting tribesmen in Yemen have little loyalty to, and often defy, the weak central government,' says Podell

Temple monkeys in India are often aggressive crooks and will steal anything, Podell says
