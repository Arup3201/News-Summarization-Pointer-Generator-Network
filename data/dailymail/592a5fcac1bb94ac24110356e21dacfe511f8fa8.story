These ghostly images reveal the forgotten harbour built off the coast of Normandy that for six months after D-Day became the world's busiest docks.

British scientists have found the remnants of Mulberry B on the Channel seabed, which allowed the Allies to land troops, vehicles and equipment on French soil without having to capture a port first.

The makeshift harbour, nicknamed Port Winston because it was the brainchild of Churchill, was the size of Dover and is considered to be one of the greatest military achievements of 
all time.

Discovery: The foundations of an breakwaters of Mulberry B - the celebrated World War Two harbour of Normandy - has been found by British scientists

Remarkable: The temporary harbour (pictured in 1944) was Churchill's brainchild and allowed troop, vehicles, weapons and supplies to be brought into France with ease

Vast: A vertical aerial photograph of Mulberry B taken by 541 Squadron on 27 October 1944 shows its scale and design

Its development was even described by Albert Speer - 
Hitler's architect and armaments minister - as 'genius'.

It allowed 220,000 men, 50,000 vehicles and 600,000 tones of supplies to be landed in France and undoubtedly helped win the war. 

Experts from the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO), which is part of the Ministry of Defence, have found that its structure still remains remarkably intact just months before the 69th anniversary of its construction.

They fired a 'multi-beam echo sounder' at the sea bed off Arromanches Sur Mer and the 3D images it produced show that large sunken 'beetles', which supported floating roadways, can be found at a depth of five metres.

There are also large chunks of breakwater structures. which protected it from storms.

'It was amazing to discover how much remained despite being pounded by the sea for all those years,' said Chris Howlett, who was leading the UKHO research.

Winston Churchill had proposed a similar 
concept in World War One but it became a reality in the next war thanks 
to Welsh engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes.

Mulberry B was one of two temporary harbours built after D-Day.

Mulberry A was installed at Omaha Beach, for 
American invasion forces; Mulberry B was set up at Arromanches (Gold 
Beach) for the British and Canadians.

Only two weeks after D-Day, a massive storm destroyed Mulberry A. 
Mulberry B also sustained some damage, but was reinforced to keep it 
operable at least until the end of October.

Winston Churchill personally ordered the temporary harbours, sending a directive on May 30, 1942 to Admiral Mountbatten (centre), the head of combined operations. Hitler's architect Albert Speer (far right, with the Fuhrer) called the jetties 'an idea of simple genius'

Mulberry B was left open until November 19 and Hughes was involved throughout, making adjustments and reinforcements.

The pre-fabricated harbours were towed across the English Channel in chunks and put into place on the Normandy beaches.

The plans were drawn up during an intensive seven-week period, from June 17 to August 6, 1942 - two years before D-Day.

Churchill personally ordered the temporary harbours, sending a directive on May 30, 1942 to Admiral Mountbatten, the head of combined operations.

It stated curtly: 'Piers for use on beaches. They must float up and down with the tide. The anchor problem must be mastered. Let me have the best solution worked out. Don’t argue the matter. The difficulties will argue for themselves.'

Defence: A photo taken from the gun turret at high tide, probably showing Mulberry B's western breakwater. Note the open tops and gun turrets, equipped with a 40mm anti aircraft gun

Pride: Piers being built in a dry dock in Britain, probably in Southampton, before they were shipped across the Channel

Hughes was chosen to head the project with instructions to prepare plans for 'prototypes of landing piers to be towed across the Channel and sunk into place'.

The piers were to be 'capable of carrying the heaviest tanks and artillery ... [and] of being towed from one assault beach to another....'

He would also have to account for projected tidal and wind conditions at the beaches in France.

Tasked with validating the plans, Hughes selected the estuary of the River Conwy in North Wales as a test site.

Historic: This original sketch is by Welsh engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes, who devised two types of device, codenamed 'Hippos' (concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads) and 'Crocs' (steel roadways linking them together)

Today: Remains of Mulberry B at Arromanches (Gold beach) in Normandy, used by the British and Canadians during WW2

In late 1942 and early 1943, he recruited almost a thousand workers for the construction and testing of the mobile harbours.

The project was so secret that even the men working on it were unaware of its true purpose.

Hughes devised two types of device, codenamed 'Hippos' (concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads) and 'Crocs' (steel roadways linking them together).

These were subsequently towed to another secret test site in south-west Scotland. There, Hughes’ efforts were integrated with prototypes developed by two other teams.

The work at Garlieston, Wigtownshire in Scotland included development and testing of breakwaters, the idea for which came from engineer Robert Lochner.

He had noticed while having a bath that when he made waves on one side of the flannel, on the other side the waters were calm.

The Mulberry harbours were completed by May 1944 and successfully launched with the use of tug boats soon after.

They were, as Churchill later wrote, 'to form a principal part of the great plan'.
