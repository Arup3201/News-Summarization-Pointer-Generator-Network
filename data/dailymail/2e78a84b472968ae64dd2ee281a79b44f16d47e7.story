The slums of Rio de Janeiro are undergoing
radical transformations as the state
authority continues its hardline strategy of using the military and police to
physically clear the ghettos of the drug dynasties that have controlled them
for decades. 

So far 140 favelas in Rio
city have been pacified, the term that indicates a community has been freed
from the grip of drug traffickers.

There are still, however, over 1,000
favelas in Rio State that remain unpacified.

Dominant: The Alemão favela will soon have a 500-store shopping centre- the first to be built in any of Rio's slums. The area is made up of 13 different communities built on several hills in the north of Rio city

Nevertheless, for the shanty-towns that are now experiencing peace, the cessation
of violence is having a dramatic and positive effect on hundreds of lives and injecting
opportunities and growth into what was a poverty-striken and neglected economy. 

Recent research by Brazil’s Institute of
Popular Data found that around 12 million people living in shanty-towns now earn
over £16 billion a year and are fast becoming a new and lucrative consumer
market.

Around 65 percent of favela residents are considered middle class,
versus 37 percent in 2002.

'This used to be an invisible market, because
it was right under our noses,'  says Data Popular Director
Renato Meireilles, 'but people only saw favelas through the perspective of
violence and drug trafficking.'

Much of the growth is attributed to
Brazil’s emerging economy, low levels of unemployment and government
initiatives that have pulled thousands out of poverty and in the case of the
pacification projects, brought stability and urban renewal to communities.

According to the Data Popular
survey, over the last ten years the number of those living in favelas with
washing machines doubled to over 50 percent.

Nearly 90 percent have cell
phones, and 40 percent have computers. Around 45 percent are regular internet
users. About 70 percent of favela residents go to the shopping centre every
week, and 50 percent eat out on a weekly basis.

Silver screen: The improvements to the favela include a cinema- the first to be brought to a slum. The area has benefitted from the state's strategy to physically remove their drug factions

Now the first favela mall is being planned
for the Alemão slum complex, an
area made up of 15 different communities, based in the north of Rio city.
Developers say the shopping centre will have 500 stores and create 6,000 jobs.

The opening of the mall in Alemao will be a
huge boost to an area that is already beginning to thrive following
pacification and growing interest from thousands of tourists.

Every weekend the number of foreigners and visitors using the local transport going
into Alemao surpasses the numbers of residents taking the same route as passengers.

That’s because the favela boasts a surprising major attraction in the shape of a
152 cable car service that provides one of the most stunning views of the hillside
shanty-town and breathtaking scenic vistas of the Rio cityscape.

Covering 3.5
kilometers from the bottom to the top in just under 20 minutes and stopping at
five stations on the way, the gondola
trip up the Alemao has become so popular with tourists that it is now the
second most visited location in Rio according to Roberta La Rovere, from Rio de
Janeiro’s International communications office.

'The Alemao favela cable cars have pushed the
Sugar Loaf Mountain cable car attraction into third place. Tourism to Alemao now sits behind the Christ
Statue which is still in first place.

'Last year over six million people visited
Alemao using the cable cars and every day it carries more than 12,000
passengers into the heart of the slum,' she said.

It’s a far cry from when the Alemao favela
was a no-go area even for the police.

Olympic effort: A sports centre for children sits just outside the favela. It models itself on the training and commitment ethos of an Olympic village

Vast: There are many areas of the densely populated favela that will not benefit from the upgrades

Three years ago the densely packed slum was
the stronghold of the feared Red Command gangsters.

The drug traffickers
controlled the comings and goings of the 300,000 residents and dictated their
daily lives which were blighted by drug-fueled shootouts and stray bullets that
often took innocent lives.

Now thanks to the pacification strategy that saw
3,000 armed security agents enter the favela with tanks and machine guns and wrest
control of the territory from drug factions in 2010, the slum dwellers can go
in and out as they please as the security of the area is now provided by a
permanent police presence  - the Police
Pacification Units (UPP). 

Grocery store holder, Andre de Paiva, 36,
has lived in Alemao all his life and says he has seen a lot of changes for the
better since the drug traffickers were forced out of the slum.

'It is more
peaceful and calmer. We are beginning to have a normal life here that everyone
else who has never lived in a favela takes for granted,' Mr de Paiva says.

'We used to pay taxes to the drug dealers
for a poor service, now we are getting a public service which has more
guarantees,' he adds.

Marcelo Ramos, 38, who has lived in Alemao for
25 years, gave up his job last year as a telecoms technician to take advantage
of the increasing numbers of visitors after pacification.

He opened up a Bistro
in the heart of the favela specializing in German beers.

'If we didn’t have the UPP here I
wouldn’t have opened my bistro because people from outside the community
wouldn’t come,' says Mr Ramos.

'My customers are evenly divided between
residents, non residents and tourists. The UPP has improved the frequency and
increased the movement of people in the complex,' he adds.

More than £250 million from the government’s growth acceleration programme
(PAC) has been ploughed into the hillside shanty-town bringing new health
clinics, creches and sports areas along with 1500 new homes. 

Noticeable improvements include better road
systems, waste management services, upgrades in street lighting and a heavily
used complaints hotline phone number that dials direct to Rio authorities on
which residents can voice their grievances, make suggestions and notify
officials of problems in their vicinity.

However, the complex is so large that there
are still many areas in the favela that have not benefited from the upgrading
and changes.

Alan Brum, director of the Institute for Moving
Roots, a local organization that seeks to promote social and cultural development
says: 'In the poorer areas of the complex there are still homes of wood
and wattle and daub, which accentuates the disparity in relation to the areas
where there has been effective action by the government.'

Educational: A new technology centre gives precious access to computers and tablets with training for adults and educational playtime for children

He says the plans drawn up by the
authorities, mostly, do not reflect the needs of residents, such as basic
sanitation. 'The government has just been
acting from its own point of view and not from the standpoint of the
community.'

One initiative that has been welcomed by
the community which was impossible to implement while the drug lords ruled is
the mapping of Alemao’s streets.

For years there has been no road names just a
warren of alleyways that only favela dwellers could make sense of. Now roads
are being given names, houses numbers and people postal addresses.

'Before I got a postal address I used to
collect all my mail from my neighbourhood association.

'They would announcement
the arrival of the post on loud speakers and the community radio. Now we are
starting to get deliveries by postal workers,' says Mr de Paiva.

The first favela cinema – CineCarioca – has
been opened in Alemao and a technology centre provides access to computers and
tablets with training for adults and educational playtime for children.

Many of
the youngsters use the centre for homework support and they also get the opportunity
to play video games.

An athletics and exercise centre for children
that models itself on the training and commitment ethos of an Olympic village
is situated just on the edge of Alemao.

The centre offers over 19 different
sports including, swimming, football, basketball, ji jitsu and gymnastics.

Thirteen year old Gustava Rafael hasn’t
missed a day of football since Alemao was liberated. 'I come here twice a week
to play and it’s so different now that we have had the changes.

'I don’t like
talking about the times before when things were bad, I like to forget it and when
I play football it helps me to do that,' he said.

Luis Lavisch Salamanca, Advisor to the
secretary of sports and leisure for Rio, says: 'All the children who come to
the sports centre have been living in a war zone since they were born. This
centre helps them to reassimilate into normal life and rebuild their
self-esteem.

'We provide therapy and
discipline through sport which strengthens their social values such as respect
for rules and collaborative work and we hope this will positively shape their
future attitude as they grow up.'
