These are the women who are  defying the Taliban to follow their dream of becoming professional cyclists.

While Afghanistan's national men's cricket and football teams have enjoyed the spotlight recently, women's sports have endured stuttering progress in the face of family pressure and a lack of public support.

But the National Cycling Team has been breaking new ground for women's sports in the country and pushing the boundaries of what is - and is not - acceptable for young women in the conservative Muslim nation.

One team member, Malika Yousufi, even dreams of becoming the first Afghan woman to compete in the Tour de France - a cycling event dominated by men since its first event in 1903.

Under the Taliban in the 1990s, women in Afghanistan were
excluded from public life, banned from going to school or
stepping outside their home without a male family member.

Women's rights have made gains since the hardline Islamist
group's ouster in 2001, but observers worry that progress is at
risk as violence against women persists and women remain
under-represented in politics.

'We are resolved to keep our commitments to women and wewill protect and reinforce our achievements,' President AshrafGhani's office said in a statement released after the presidentmade a speech ahead of International Women's Day on March 8.

Last year, the women's cricket team was quietly dissolved
amid Taliban threats and a shortage of players.

athletes.

pile their bikes in cars and drive outside the capital, where
their uniform of loose-fitting tops and long pants won't draw
stares.

During the ride, the coach leads the pack in a car.

'The coach is like a shield for us,' Yousufi said. 'If he
wasn't there, we couldn't ride.'

Even so, drivers sometimes shout profanities at the riders,
and their team captain is struggling with a back injury from a crash
after a man on a motorbike reached out to grab her.

Abdul Sadiq Sadiqi, the coach and president of the Afghan
Cycling Federation, is not overly concerned.

Determined: Zahra Alizada (right) and Frozan Rasooli (following in a blue scarf) prepare themselves for another day's training on the road

Team effort: More than 40 women train with the group, and the best among them are competing in international competitions

'These are people who don't let their children go to
school,' Sadiqi said.

More than 40 women train with the group, and the core team
has competed in several international competitions.

On a recent morning, team members leaned into the curves in
the road, whizzing past a checkpoint where a group of soldiers
watched them pass. 

'Nothing will stop us,' Yousufi said.
