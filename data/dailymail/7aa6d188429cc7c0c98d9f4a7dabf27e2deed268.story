A retired nurse has made a 7,000 mile pilgrimage from Canada to England for the last five years just to visit a tree.

Val Theroux, 64, is so infatuated with the oak she even found it on Google Earth so she could see it from abroad.

The mother-of-two flies over just to see the tree and gets up early in the morning so she can be alone with it.

Don't ever leaf me: Val in the shadow of her one true love

During her visits to the oak, in Brockenhurst, in the New Forest, Hampshire, she hugs it and stands with her back against it.

Her husband of 40 years, John, 63, jokes that it is her 'tree lover' and used to join her for the visits but now prefers to stay at home.

Val said she discovered the oak, which is at a popular spot for picnic makers and has a rope for children to swing from, in 2005 while visiting her daughter.

She said: 'When I first walked in the New Forest I felt that I was home in a way that I never had before.

'I came back the next year with my husband and I've been drawn back to the forest ever since.

'As soon as I walked around the corner and glimpsed my special tree I felt connected to it.

'I think all trees have an energy, like people. But some people are good friends and some are soul mates, that's what this tree is to me.

'I know it like a person. It's like you see a house that appeals to you and you'd remember that.

'I first thought of this tree as a teenager but its character has matured a lot over the last 12 months.'

Val Theroux is just one of many people around the world who feel an emotional and often romantic desire towards inanimate objects.

In March, British citizen Amanda Whittaker spoke of her attraction to the Statue of Liberty, saying:  'She is my long-distance lover and I am blown away by how stunning she is. Other people might be shocked to think I can have romantic feelings for an object, but I am not the same as them.'

In 2007 Robert Stewart, 51, admitted a sexually aggravated breach of the peace after stripping off and simulating sex with a bicycle in Scotland. Mr Stewart was caught by cleaners in his bedroom at hostel in Ayr.

The court heard: ‘They used a master key to unlock the door and they then observed the accused wearing only a white t-shirt, naked from the waist down. The accused was holding the bike and moving his hips back and forth as if to simulate sex.’

For some, close emotional relationships with humans are incomprehensible.

Val, from Kamloops, in British Columbia, has flown to the tree once each year since discovering it in 2008, costing around £4,000.

She believes trees hold a lot of wisdom because they have been around for so long and says she is able to tune into her tree's perspective of the world when she is home in Canada.

Val added: 'Some trees will not give you the time of day, while others are very welcoming.

'I come over specifically just to see it. If I'm here for a week I will see it most days and spend a few hours with it.

'I've been very happily married for 40 years but my husband and I joke that I come back to see my tree lover. I get a lot of healing from this tree and go away feeling like I've seen an old friend.'

Val, who is currently in the UK visiting her tree, says she will continue to make her annual pilgrimage as long as she can afford to.

She said: 'I love my husband dearly, I would never look sideways at another man, except this tree.

'My husband is quite used to me and he doesn't necessarily want to come and visit the same place again, so I come on my own.'
