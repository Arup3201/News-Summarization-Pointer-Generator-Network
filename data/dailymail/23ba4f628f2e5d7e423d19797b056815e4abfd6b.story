Carina Tyrell - who has just won the swimsuit round of Miss England - is challenging preconceived notions about pageant competitors.

For Carina is in her fifth year studying medicine at the University of Cambridge.

Carina, 24, who holds the title of Miss Cambridgeshire, has just been award the crown of Miss Beach Beauty 2014, which sees her fast-tracked into the final 15 competitors.

Carina Tyrell, currently studying medicine at Cambridge University and the current Miss Cambridgeshire, has been chosen as the first of 15 finalists to be the next Miss England after winning the swimwear round of Miss England

Carina, currently in her fifth year studying medicine at Cambridge University's Murray Edwards College, said winning a place in the Miss England final gives her a chance to 'give something back'.

The student modelled a stunning white and beige Heidi Klein which, along with her perfect body, earned her the accolade of being the first girl to be fast-tracked through to the top 15 for the final stages of the contest, which will take place from 14 to 16 June 2014 in Torquay.

All contestants are are all hoping to follow in the
 footsteps of the reigning Miss England, Kirsty Heslewood, 24, who 
joined them in Torquay, Devon, for a photoshoot on the deck of a luxury 
yacht.

Another of the girls, Miss Cornwall, 
Emma Smith, 22 was bullied at school because of a lazy eye - but turned 
the tables on her tormentors by getting straight As in her A-levels and 
going to medical school.

Constants this year include medical students as well as psychology students, dancers  and trainee accountants

The women seemed to be enjoying the photo shoot, despite the rather unpredictable British summertime weather

The annual beauty contest is staged in Torquay where last year local MP Adrian Sanders said it was an 'own goal' for women.

His 
comments were dismissed by a previous winner Charlotte Holmes, from 
Torpoint, Cornwall, who said this was precisely the sort of stereotyped 
view the girls were hoping to challenge.

And the woman behind the Miss England contest has come to its defence.

Founder of the Miss England competition Angela Beasley argues that despite appearances: 'It's not just about turning up in a swimsuit and looking pretty'

Director Angela Beasley said accusations that the contest was inappropriate nowadays were old-fashioned.

The swimwear round of the competition was launched on Monday at Torquay Marina amid reports there was unease that it was getting a Â£7000 subsidy from Torbay Council to stage the show.

But Angela Beasley said the view that beauty pageants were degrading was outdated.

The contestants have their own Baywatch moment as they run out of the no doubt rather chilly English sea onto the beach

She said: 'We've come a long way from girls just turning up with their heels and swimsuit and walking on a catwalk to be judged.

'Now girls take part in various rounds including a tough sports round - you have to be physically fit.

'The current Miss England ran the London Marathon this year and raised thousands of pounds for childrens' charities.

'Miss England is about being a good role model.

'There's a talent round where the girls submit their talent - what they think they're good at.

'They have to be good at something - it could be their jobs or something they enjoy doing.

'There's an eco-fashion round where the girls have to create an outfit using recycled materials - they have to be creative.

As well as the swimwear round, the competition now includes a sports round and an Eco-fashion round

Despite many feeling the bikini portion of the competition is demeaning to women, the 14 contestants showed off their bodies with seeming joy

'It's not just about turning up in a swimsuit and looking pretty.

'Modelling competitions are about just looks alone.

'Miss England is about being a good all-rounder and a good role model. This year alone, we had 20,000 girls apply to enter the competition.

'When people stop applying to be a role model we'll stop holding the competition.'

Current Miss England Kirsty Heslewood also said she felt the pageant was positive.

'I feel it empowers women to do good things for their country, their communities and be good role models.

'It's completely changed from how it used to be.

'It promotes fitness and good health.'
