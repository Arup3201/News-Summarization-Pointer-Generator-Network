Coffee lovers in Milton Keynes can now order their hot drinks from behind the wheel instead of at the counter after the town has welcomed a Starbucks drive-thru.

On Friday, Milton Keynes' first 24 hour Sturbucks opened its hatch at The Place Retail Park in the town's centre.

And soon latte lovers across the country will be able to use the facility as Starbucks begins its plans to roll out 200 UK drive-thrus.

How the Starbucks drive-thrus work: Customers speak into a microphone and then drive forward to a manned hatch where a Starbucks employee hands over the drink

Thanks to the drive thru outlets 5,000 new jobs will be introduced across the UK and the company will create new apprenticeships. Pictured here are members of the new Milton Keynes team

To order a coffee, customers speak into a microphone and then drive forward to a manned hatch where a Starbucks employee hands over the drink.

The drive-thrus are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The concept has been popular in America for years, with thousands of outlets across the country.

Drive-thrus cropped up as early as 2008 in the UK when Starbucks experimented with 10 initial roadside outlets. The first was opened in Cardiff.

But in 2011 the company announced that it would be fully importing the trend across the pond and introducing 200 UK drive-thrus.

In the same year, Costa Coffee also announced that it would open 75 UK drive-thrus.

Half of the Starbucks outlets will be located at petrol stations following an agreement with Euro Garages.

And thanks to the new shops a further 5,000 employees will be hired across the UK.

Yesterday, Milton Keynes' first drive through opened at The Place Retail Park.

And as well as keeping caffeine lovers satisfied, the branch has brought 25 jobs to the area with five new apprentice positions.

The store's manager, Kathryn Dunham, told Milton Keynes website MK Web: 'Weâ€™ve got a fantastic store team and are very lucky to have five very enthusiastic apprentices.'

Simon Redfern, communications director for Starbucks UK, told the local website: 'We know that customers want to visit us in new places and spaces and drive-thru stores are proving very popular.

This new store in Milton Keynes is not only bringing fantastic coffee, but also great job opportunities to the area.'
