A class of insecticide called neonicotinoids have already been proved to harm honeybee colonies.

And now Dutch researchers have discovered that starlings and swallows disappear in areas treated with the chemical.

It is the first time that scientists have directly linked a neonicotinoid called imidacloprid to the death of birds.

Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in the world.

The class of neonictinoid insecticide has been linked to the death of 15 species of birds in the Netherlands.

Scientists found that the higher the concentration of imidacloprid in the surface water studied, the greater the decline in bird numbers.

Numbers of the birds studied decreased on average by 3.5 percent per year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre.

This concentration is greatly exceeded in many parts of the Netherlands.

They noted that populations of 15 species of birds are declining in areas where farmers have treated their crops with imidacloprid.

The experts looked closely at data on local bird population trends and environmental factors, which include imidacloprid concentrations in surface water, to come up with their findings, which were published in the journal Nature.

It is the first study to correlate imidacloprid, which is the most widely used insecticide in the world, to possible indirect harmful side effects via the food chain, for birds.

Ecologists at Radboud University Nijmegen and the Sovon Centre for Field Ornithology in the Netherlands, explained the trend by identifying concentrations of neonicotinoids in surface water in relation to other factors, such as land use.

The higher the concentrations of the insecticide in the water, the greater the decline in bird numbers was seen. Populations of 15 bird species declined by 3.5 per cent on average in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid (marked in white on the map) and other regions (marked in orange and red) had higher concentrations of the insecticide in the water

The focused their study on the starling and barn swallow, which are common in the area.

Ruud Foppen from the Sovon Centre explained that the species are relatively easy to study because there is lots of data on them to analyse densities and trends in their numbers.

Most of the birds forage around ditches, hedgerows and field margins to find the insects, which they eat.

And many of the insects spend part of their life cycle in water, so the scientists measured the water quality taken by district water boards.

They found that higher the concentration of imidacloprid in the surface water, the greater the decline in bird numbers.

For the fifteen bird species that were included in the study, populations decreased on average by 3.5 percent per year in areas with more than 20 nanograms of imidacloprid per litre. 

This concentration is greatly exceeded in many parts of the Netherlands.

Experts have previously proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies over the winter, particularly when temperatures drop.

Research released in May revealed that even low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives.

The study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, strengthens the scientists’ findings from last year that low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder (CCD) where bees abandon their hives over the winter and eventually die.

We demonstrated again in this study that neonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering CCD in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival of winter,’ said lead author Chensheng (Alex) Lu, associate professor of environmental exposure biology at HSPH.

Since 2006, there have been significant losses of honeybees from CCD. Pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one-third of all crops worldwide.

Experts have considered a number of possible causes, including pathogen infestation, beekeeping practices, and pesticide exposure.

Recent findings suggest that CCD is related specifically to neonicotinoids including imidacloprid and clothianidin, which may impair bees’ neurological functions.
