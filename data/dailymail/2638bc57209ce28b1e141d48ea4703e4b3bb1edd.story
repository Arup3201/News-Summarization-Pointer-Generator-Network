Spread over 235,000 square metres, with space for 400 shops, a 20-screen cinema and 10,000 car parking spaces, you wouldn't want to get lost in Abu Dhabi's latest giant shopping centre. 

These aerial photographs show that the construction of the world’s newest super mall is close to completion ahead of its opening in November, nine months later than its original March launch date.

And the project is as ambitious as you would expect.

Sprawling: Yas Mall is spread over 235,000 square metres and boasts 10,000 car parking spaces

Delay: The shopping centre is nearing completion, although it was originally due to open nine months ago

Yas Mall is being built on a man-made island and is set to become the second largest shopping centre in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 

The sprawling complex is predicted to attract 20 million shoppers per year and will cover a 235,000 square metre plot on Yas Island, which is also home to the Ferrari World theme park.

Ambitious: The sprawling project will house 400 shops and is predicted to attract 20 million shoppers per year

Located close to Abu Dhabi International Airport, it will be home to over 400 shops, including the region’s largest department store, a 20-screen cinema complex, a family entertainment zone, and Abu Dhabi’s largest hypermarket.

The centre will include the largest Nike, Adidas, H&M and Zara stores in the region, plus the first Abu Dhabi outlet of U.S. clothing store Brooks Brothers, which will be the biggest in the Middle East.

There will also be some British stores in the line-up, including House of Fraser and Abu Dhabi’s first Hamleys toy store,

And, with 10,000 spaces in the car park, it might take you a while to make your way back to your vehicle.

Despite its size, the mall is dwarfed by the UAE’s largest shopping centre, Dubai Mall, which measures a staggering 502,000 square metres.

But Mohammed Khalifa Al Mubarak, CEO of Aldar Properties, the developers behind Yas Mall, told CNN that the company is already planning an expansion before the mall has opened its doors.

‘We couldn't fit all the retailers we wanted to be here, so we're already starting to plan phase two,’ he said.

‘Abu Dhabi is a growing city. It's growing in its developments, it's growing in its demographics. And we are catering our retail for each aspect.’

On track: Yas Island is also home to Ferrari World, a theme park dedicated to the famous racing car company

Thrilling ride: Ferrari World features one of the world’s fastest roller coasters, Formula Rossa, which travels at 149mph in 4.9 seconds, recreating the G-force felt in a Formula One car

Yas Island opened in 2009 and is home to one of the world’s biggest water parks, a Formula One track and Ferrari World, a theme park dedicated to the famous racing car company.

The park features one of the world’s fastest roller coasters, Formula Rossa, which travels at 149mph in 4.9 seconds, recreating the G-force felt in a Formula One car.

It is so fast that riders have to wear safety goggles like those worn by a racing driver during a Grand Prix.

There is also a tower ride that shoots riders 62 metres (203 feet) into the air and the Fiorano GT Challenge, where visitors can ‘race’ their friends in a Ferrari F430 Spider.
