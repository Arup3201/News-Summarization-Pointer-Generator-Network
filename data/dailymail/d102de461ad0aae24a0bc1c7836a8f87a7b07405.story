'He wanted to push things to the limit,' said a weeping Stejskal in an interview Monday.

'He's just like Superman.' 

On Monday Metrolink officials told the LA Times that Plitt and his film crew did not have permission to be on the commuter railroad's right-of-way.

'He had no permit to be there,' said Jeff Lustgarten, a Metrolink spokesman. 

'We have a whole process for people to go through if they want to be on our right-of-way, especially for film crews.'
