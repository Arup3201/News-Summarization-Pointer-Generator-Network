At the tender age of 34, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard admits that having the correct fitness routine is 'key' to him being able to perform each week at Anfield.

Gerrard may no longer be the box to box midfielder of old, but his role in Brendan Rodgers' side is vital to the team's success.

Here, the Liverpool midfielder details exactly what he needs to do to keep himself in good shape for the grueling Premier League campaign. 

Steven Gerrard takes Pilates sessions to increase his flexibility and keep in shape for Liverpool

Gerrard's performances last season played a huge role in Liverpool's Premier League title challenge

'If I am playing Saturday to Saturday, managing my workload during the week is key.

'When I’m training off the pitch I normally do three weight sessions each day to improve my upper-body strength and one working on my lower body to improve leg strength. I also do two core or Pilates sessions to increase my flexibility.

'On the pitch I train for an hour and a half each day. That includes drills, ball-work, cardio and a lot of running.

'On a match day, diet and hydration is so important.

The 34-year-old has barely missed a minute of Liverpool's Premier League campaign this season

'My diet is heavy with protein and carbohydrates on a match day to provide energy. That means lots of chicken, fish and eggs for the protein and pasta, rice and potatoes for the carbs. I also eat yoghurts.

'You’ve got to make sure you get the right amount of sports drinks on match day to keep up your energy levels. In the morning I have plenty of fluids, so water and Lucozade Sport for the electrolytes.'
