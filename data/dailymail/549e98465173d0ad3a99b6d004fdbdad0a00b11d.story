A North Carolina teenager tried to kill her grandmother by dumping insecticide and termite killer into a pot of collard greens because the woman took the girl's cell phone, authorities said.

Tyt'ana Lisa-Nicole Johnson, 17, of Fayetteville, was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder for dumping the chemicals into a pot of the greens being cooked by Gaylon Moody, 51, while she was at Easter mass.

A friend of the grandmother's also ate the greens. Both were treated at a local hospital and released.

She was on punishment. I had taken her cellphone from her. She got mad because I took her cellphone from her, and she poisoned my food,' Moody stold the Fayetteville Observer. 'I'll tell you one thing: It ain't good to feel.'

The teen admitted to dumping the deadly poison in the food, police told the paper.

'We started feeling funny afterwards,' Moody said. '[The friend] and I started feeling very funny, started feeling numb from my waist up.'

The other victim told the paper everything he ate and drank 'tasted different.'

Both tried to drive to a hospital a hospital but couldn't make it.

'We were staggering like we were intoxicated, but neither one of us drank,' Moody told WRAL.

They were initially treated for a stomach virus, but found out the next day the symptoms were the result of being poisoned.

The teen apologized for poisoning the other victim, he told the station.

'They got her locked up, but she needs help,' he said. 'Seriously, something's wrong with her. People donâ€™t do that over cellphones.

Johnson is being held in the county jail on $500,000 bail. Jail records didn't indicate whether she had an attorney.

Under North Carolina criminal law, anyone 16 years and older is considered an adult. She stands to spend a significant amount of time behind bars if convicted.
