The look of joy on the owner's face is unmistakable.

As his dog is rescued after a long period of being lost in woods in the US, the owner opens his arms and the pooch jumps into them.

The dog and his owner are clearly delighted to be reunited as they greet each other in this adorable video which shows the emotional moment a beloved pet is found after going missing.

The man who found the dog, which they call Zeezee, is first filmed holding the cute Chihuahua, with blood on his T-shirt from a scratch above his lip.

'Don't worry the blood is mine, it's not hers,' he assures the dog's owner as he hands her over. 

The scratch on the man's face is perhaps the result of an excited greeting from Zeezee, but he assures her owner, 'It's fine, I'm fine.'

Here you go! The man who found the dog, left, proudly hands her over to her owner, right, after finding her 

The man who first finds her looks pretty emotional too as he calls for her owner to come over and hands her over proudly.

Zeezee looks none the worse for her extended sojourn in the woods - but is certainly pleased to see her owner, who she licks frantically. 

Easy Zeezee! The chihauhau leaps into her owner's arms, left, and kisses his face. Right, his expression of joy

It may not be clear exactly where in the US the video was taken but the joy on the owner's face is certainly clear as he scoops Zeezee into his arms and she responds lovingly.

'Call Katy!' the owner says with a huge smile on his face, wanting everyone close to the dog to know immediately that she has been found.

That's one lucky Chihuahua.
