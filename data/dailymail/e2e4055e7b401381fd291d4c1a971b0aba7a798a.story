An American teenager managed to convince police, a court judge and U.S. immigration that she was an illegal immigrant before having herself deported to Colombia.

Jakadrien Turner, 15, ran away from home in Dallas, Texas in November 2010 after becoming distraught over the death of her grandfather and parents' divorce.

She was arrested in Houston for theft in April last year. The teenager, then 14, gave officers a fake name - Tika Lanay Cortez - claiming she was a 21-year-old illegal immigrant from Colombia.

She was convicted of theft under the name Cortez. Her defense attorney also believed that to be her true identity.

While serving time in prison, she was referred to the State Department of Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) who she also convinced that she came from Colombia.

After a thorough investigation, it was
decided she would be deported. However prior to this, she was also 
interviewed by the Colombian Consulate who agreed that she was a Colombian
citizen and approved paperwork for her.

The 15-year-old was then deported to Bogota where she was given full Colombian citizenship, work permit and released. Miss Turner, who reportedly speaks no Spanish, ended up working as a housemaid. 

A Facebook profile, was reportedly set up by Jakadrien Turner, for Tika SoloToolonq (Tika Confero). It says she is originally from Bridgetown, Barbados, studied at Texas Southern University and lives in Bogota.

It says she speaks Colombian Spanish along with Creole and Cajun French. In June, her employer was listed as the Convergys Corporation, a management strategy company. She also later worked at a similar company called Teleperformance and had mentioned previously she was employed as a maid.

According to a source at the U.S. 
department of immigration there have been cases in the past where 
individuals provide inaccurate information regarding who they are and 
their immigration status for ulterior motives.

On her Facebook profile, Tika SoloToolonq
has posted pictures with a group of women labelled 'Familia... me happy
4 once, in the Mountains'. She appears to be photographed in Colombia.

Distraught: Jakadrien's mother Johnessa Turner (left) and her grandmother Lorene have begged state officials for help in having her returned

On October 27, she changed her status from 'single' to 'in a relationship'.  She is listed as in a relationship with Alejandro Yoel Almeida Cisneros, originally from Havana, Cuba, who also works at Teleperformance.

On November 15, she posted: 'Well bak in
a relationship with same man I broke up with, lol! I love him dearly 
tho!!!! I think that will never happen, mae that mistake of oing that, 
beause he show me that he is serious with me, an so on, so ok lol!!!!!' 
[sic]

Miss Turner or Miss SoloToolonq never mentions deportation but does discuss missing home.

She also has a Twitter account on which she writes will be posted 'Good Mature EXPLICIT TWEETS'.

According to ICE, checks on immigration status of individuals in the agency's custody were not based on race, ethnicity or language abilities - but rather by documentation verifying the immigration status.

Her distraught grandmother Lorene Turner spent more than a year trawling Facebook trying to find her granddaughter and finally tracked her down in the South American country.

'She [Jakadrien Turner] maintained this false identity throughout her local criminal proceedings.'

Immigration spokeswoman

At the time of her arrest, the State Department of Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) ran Miss Turner's fingerprints but she was not found in the system.

An ICE official denied that Miss Turner had assumed the name of an existing Colombian citizen with outstanding criminal warrants.

After she found out where her 
granddaughter was, Mrs Turner contacted the U.S. government who found 
out where the girl was living. The 
American Embassy in Colombia asked police to go and collect her.

Colombian officials 
put the 15-year-old, who is allegedly pregnant according to W-FAA TV, in a detention centre but have made no moves to release her for 
more than a month. It was unclear when the girl will be able to return to the U.S.

The Department of State confirmed to MailOnline that they were aware of the case and were working with Colombian officials in Bogota but had no further comment at this time.

Questions have been raised as to how a  black, American teenager was mistaken for a South American woman.

ICE spokeswoman, Gillian Christensen, said: 'ICE takes these allegations very seriously.  At the direction of DHS, ICE is fully and immediately investigating this matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of this case.

Far from home: Miss Turner gave police a fake name which happened to be the same as a 22-year-old illegal Colombian immigrant - and was sent 'back' to Bogota

No way back: The teenage girl was taken from Houston, Texas by U.S. state officials and released in Bogota, Colombia

'Preliminary information suggests 
that after being arrested on state charges for theft by the Houston 
Police Department, the minor provided a false identity, representing 
that she was an adult from Colombia with no legal status in the U.S. 

'She
maintained this false identity throughout her local criminal 
proceedings in Texas where she was represented by a defense attorney and
ultimately convicted by the State criminal court.

At no time during these criminal proceedings was her identity determined to be false.

'Upon
her conviction, she was referred to ICE where she continued to maintain
a false identity during immigration court proceedings.

Involved: A Facebook page reportedly set up by Jakadrien Turner under the name Tika Solotoolonq claims that she is in a relationship with Cuban Alejandro Yoel Almeida Cisneros

'As
is standard protocol, criminal database searches and biometric 
verification were conducted and revealed no information to invalidate 
her claims. She was ultimately ordered removed from the U.S. by a 
Department of Justice immigration judge.'

Benjamin Todd Jealous, president of the civil rights organisation, the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), met with President Obama to discuss the matter this morning, a spokesman told MailOnline. The organisation was unable to comment on the outcome of the meeting today.

 'How do you deport a 15-year-old to Colombia? Without a passport, without anything?'

Jakadrien was reported missing last year and her family initially thought she may have travelled to 
New Orleans, according to the National Center for Missing Children.

On the U.S. immigration department's website it states that it 'places a high priority on combating illegal immigration, including targeting illegal aliens with criminal records who pose a threat to public safety'. 

Chief Charles A McClelland Jr, of the Houston Police Department, released this statement:

'On April 2, 2011, a female suspect was arrested by HPD officers for Class B misdemeanor theft. The female told the arresting officers she was a native of Colombia and that her name was Tika Lanay Cortez, born on March 24, 1990.

'Officers transported her to the HPD Southeast Jail where she was processed. Personnel fingerprinted her and followed procedure by processing her through the secure communities database to determine if she was wanted by immigration and custom enforcement [ICE] personnel.

Dumped: Miss Turner, who speaks no Spanish, was left in the South American county with a work card after being removed from the U.S. under a mistaken identity

'It provided no prior arrest history, 
no wanted status or alternate identification for the prisoner. As is 
customary, the prisoner was the transported to the Harris County Jail 
and booked on a theft charge.'

Colombia is the most violent nation in Latin America, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace last year.

It is the world's largest producer of cocaine and around one third of citizens have been affected by armed conflict either through warring drug factions or long-running civil wars. 

During the first six months of 2011 it was estimated that 98,000 people had to flee their homes due to the armed conflict in the country.

Colombia has the fourth largest economy in Latin America but there is huge inequality. Some 46 per cent of people live below the poverty line and 17 per cent in 'extreme poverty'.

Impoverished: Almost half of Colombians live below the poverty line while last year it was voted the most dangerous country in Latin America
