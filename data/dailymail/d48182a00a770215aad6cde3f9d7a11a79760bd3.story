A veteran dealer was accused yesterday of selling fake paintings on an ‘industrial scale’ at some of Britain’s best known arts and antiques markets.

Bill Harbord, 81, is suspected of earning hundreds of thousands of pounds from the sale of works purporting to be by highly collectible modern artists.

A renowned German museum is warning tourists to avoid his paintings, which often come signed and with official-looking stamps.

Pensioner Bill Harbord, 83, and his wife Enid, 80, have been accused of selling fake artwork worth hundreds of thousands of pounds from stalls in Portobello Road (pictured) and Covent Garden

Alarmed experts fear the sheer number of fakes passing through his hands could damage confidence in the already fragile market.

Mr Harbord, who has been trading art for half a century, is a regular figure at markets in London’s Portobello Road and Covent Garden.

Among the works he sells are copies of collages by Kurt Schwitters, one of Germany’s best-known modern artists, which can fetch up to £50,000 each.

He has also sold watercolours similar to those by the French Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy and works with a startling likeness to those by Dutch painter Kees van Dongen.

Mr Harbord is accused of suggesting to customers that the works are genuine, despite them only having price tags of up to £250.

The forgeries include works such as this one by Kurt Schwitters. They often have signatures on the canvas and 'official' stamps on the back

Authentic paintings by some of the artists can fetch six-figure sums, with one Dugy selling at auction last year for £315,000.

A museum in Hanover recently issued an alert over more than 100 collages sold as genuine works, including some they believe were sold by Mr Harbord.

Dr Isabel Schulz, the head of the Kurt Schwitters archive at the Sprengel Museum, said at least seven come from the pensioner’s stall.

She told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘It is very worrying. I am really angry because they are using Schwitters’s name to make money and in doing so they are damaging his reputation.’

There are growing concerns about art fraud, with amateur buyers looking for a bargain caught out by ruthless dealers.

Many forgers use recycle old canvases and frames, as well as using apparently official stamps and signatures, to give works an air of authenticity.

Experts have said the flood of fakes in the art market and creates confusion over what works and artists can be trusted.

Last week, a French institution ordered that a fake Marc Chagall painting, bought by a Leeds businessman in 1992 for £100,000, be burned.

Mr Harbord, who works with his wife Enid, 80, told one investigator that a stamp on the back of a ‘Dufy’ indicates it could be genuine.

He said: ‘It’s stamped on the back of the picture.’ Mrs Harbord added: ‘That is the gallery it was purchased from.’

Asked if it was real, Mr Harbord replied: ‘Yeah, of course.’

But confronted at his home in Herne Hill, South London, the dealer strongly denied any wrongdoing.

‘You are climbing up the wrong tree. I never, never [said they were real],' said Mr Harbord. ‘No I am sorry, we did not. I never said they were genuine, never, ever.’

Another artist Mr Harbord purports to stock is Raoul Dufy, whose genuine paintings (pictured) can sell for hundred of thousands of pounds at auction

He added: ‘Do they [customers] realistically think they can get a genuine article for that kind of price?

‘If you have someone who has lost £10,000 because of me, then you have something to write about.’

Art dealer Philip Mould, who presents BBC One’s Fake or Fortune, said passing off fakes and the real thing damages the entire industry.

He said: ‘The industrial-scale production of these fakes has a wearing effect on people’s perception of the art world. It damages confidence.’

Sue Jones, of Westminster City Council’s trading standards department, said the trader faces a formal investigation.

‘This looks and sounds like it could potentially be a breach of fair trading legislation,’ she said.

‘If people are being falsely led to believe they are buying a genuine article when it is anything but genuine, that is a con. We will be looking into this.’
