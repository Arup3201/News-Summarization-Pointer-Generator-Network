President Barack Obama brought his two daughters to Selma to 'remind them of their obligations', it has been revealed, as thousands of people are commemorating 'Bloody Sunday' for a second day.

The 53-year-old president and his family paid tribute to civil rights legends sung and unsung by leading a symbolic march across the Alabama town's Edmund Pettus Bridge on Saturday afternoon.

Speaking on the bridge in the sunshine, Obama said of his 13-year-old and 16-year-old daughter: 'I want to say what an extraordinary honor this has been, especially to have Sasha and Malia here.' 

He had previously said he hoped the girls - who wore  dresses and boots for the 50th anniversary march - would be reminded 'of their own obligations' to continue America's fight for civil rights.

'There are going to be marches for them to march, and struggles for them to fight. And if we've done our job, then that next generation is going to be picking up the torch, as well,' he said last month.

Earlier this week, in a radio interview with host Tom Joyner, Obama added: 'Part of what I want Malia and Sasha to understand is that this is an unfinished project,' referring to simmering racial tensions that flared up following the police killings of black men in Missouri and New York last year.

Today, people from across the world were  marching over the historic bridge - where police and state troopers beat and used tear gas against more than 600 protesters in 1965 - for a second day.

Among them was Mercedes Binns, who lives out of state and has visited Selma a total of 17 times because of its civil rights history. She was seen punching the air with determination as she walked.

A day earlier, Obama had led several dozen people across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to pay tribute to the 'courageous' male and female marchers who paved the way for the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

Clasping hands with 'one of my heroes,' Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Amelia Boynton Robinson, who was badly beaten on Bloody Sunday, he  strode purposefully under Alabama's bright sun. 

He was joined by Malia and Sasha, who marched along with first lady Michelle Obama and her mother, Marian Robinson, as well as former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura.

Lewis, an original Bloody Sunday participant whose head was cracked open by police as he led a group across the bridge, held court when Saturday's group stopped after about four minutes. 

In his radio interview earlier this week, Obama told Joyner that  he thinks his two daughters appreciate that people made sacrifices so that life would be easier for them.

He noted that the teenagers live in the White House with their grandmother, whom he said remembers what it was like living in a segregated setting on the South Side of Chicago.

'There is, you know, work to be done right now,' referring to America's battle for civil rights. 'And I say to my daughters the same thing I say to the young people who work for me, and that is it is a glorious task that we are given to continually try to improve this great country of ours.

Legacy: Obama also said he doubts his daughters will run for public office 'partly because they've been listening to their mother. Malia,  left, with mother Michelle (center) and grandmother Marian Robinson (right)

'And we shouldn't shy away from that work and we shouldn't be complacent about it. And everybody's got to find their own way to do it.'

Asked how he would like to see his daughters accomplish that, Obama said he doubted they would do it from a public perch.

'I am very doubtful that they will want to run for public office ... partly because they've been listening to their mother,' he said.
