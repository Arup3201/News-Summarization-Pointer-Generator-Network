Andy Kovac spotted a buck wandering around his backyard in
Bethel Park in Pittsburgh, PA. on Wednesday sporting a very interesting hat. Kovac was able to snap some photos and send them to KDKA.

The deer had a basketball stuck between its antlers but didn’t
seem too bothered by its resting atop his head.

‘That was a classic, my wife called me down, I grabbed my
camera, and luckily you can see he wasn’t in a big hurry,’ Kovac said.

According to Kovac, the ball is already deflating so the
ball won’t be stuck on the bucks head for much longer.

‘They can be very playful, we’ve seen them running around
trees, and doing all kinds of playful acts. He was probably was just playing and
pushing that ball around,’ said Kovac.

The Kovacs didn’t contact the gaming commission because the
ball doesn’t impair the deer’s ability to eat food.

The Kovacs said that they see deer in their backyard often,
and once counted 25 deer at one time.
