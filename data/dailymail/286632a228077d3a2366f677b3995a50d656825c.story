A dwarf entertainer was set alight by an Australian Rules footballer during a drunken night to celebrate the end of the players' season.

Entertainer Blake Johnston felt something hot on his backside and when he turned around saw thick smoke rising from his flammable costume.

Midfielder Clinton Jones held a barbecue lighter to Mr Johnston's costume when he was partying on
 what is traditionally known as 'Mad Monday' - to celebrate the end of 
the Aussie rules football season - setting him alight.

Humiliated: Dwarf entertainer Blake Johnston, who was set alight during St. Kilda club's Aussie Rules players' celebrations on Mad Monday in Melbourne

Mr Johnston, 31, who goes by the stage name Mr Big, suffered minor burns and was left humiliated by the ordeal, after which he and his colleague left immediately.

He told ACA9: 'I could be in hospital right now... I didn't know what to do. I've never been set on fire before.'

Mr Clinton, of St. Kilda Saints AFL team,
 Melbourne, was fined $3,000 and has now apologised for the incident on the annual 
celebratory night, which has become synonymous with giving the sport a 
bad name.

The AFL has tried to improve the image of
 the sport after repeated drunken incidents, but the initial reaction of
 the Aussie rules football chief executive did the sport no favours.

Andrew Demetriou began laughing uncontrollably when confronted with the news of the fire-lighting incident on a talk show.

Once he regained his composure, he said he was laughing because he thought it was a joke.

In interview with local news service ACA9, Mr Johnston said he was 'really upset' when he saw Mr Demetriou's reaction because 
he is the head of the AFL, it was a serious matter and he was laughing 
at it.

Police were investigating the shocking pub incident, which took place in the Bell's Hotel, in South Melbourne, which left Mr Johnston 'very shaken' according to his work partner and friend, Arthur Serevetas.

They had been employed to wear silly 
outfits and meet and greet guests at the hotel as entertainment at the 
party, each paid $250 for the service.

Players wore fancy dress costumes: some were dressed as priests, a school girl and a zombie, Mr Johnston told ACA9.

Mr Serevetas, who saw the incident happen, said he was shocked to see his performing partner being set on fire.

'Blake
 was speaking to a player when another player went behind my friend, got
 one of these gas lighters that would light up a stove and basically lit
 him up.

'His shirt and 
pants got on fire and after that, somebody put it out and he just got 
ticked off and we basically left. That was the end of our gig.' 

He said Johnston, a father, scrambled 
to extinguish the flames, then left: 'Physically Blake is OK, but he has
 been absolutely humiliated. We just quit the gig immediately,' added Mr
 Serevetas.

'He is very, very shaken.'

Mr Johnston had intended to sue the St Kilda club - whose most famous supporter is Shane Warne.

He
 was even more alarmed when he asked in an email if his clothes could be 
replaced, and got a rude reply from another player, Leigh Montagna, 
saying 'no', because he felt he didn't do his job properly.

Damage: The flames burnt the entertainer's clothes and caused minor burns

According to ABC News, Mr Johnston has now accepted an apology from the player involved and received replacement clothes. He has donated the compensation money to charity, according to ACA9.

AFL boss Mr Demetriou admitted 
yesterday it was no laughing matter and slammed the actions of St 
Kilda's players and said the tradition of Mad Monday in a sport 
suffering from a poor public image from players' bad behaviour, was 'a 
thing of a bygone era'.

The 
sport has spent the past year under a cloud of drug-taking and 
investigations into players allegedly taking banned supplements. The 
investigation by the sports anti-doping body, ASADA is continuing.

Three years ago, player Sam Gilbert 
was claimed to be the father of a baby born of a local school girl.

These allegations were later disproved, said ACA9. Then
 naked photos of Capt Nick Riewoldt and Nick Del Santo surfaced.

They 
claimed a St Kilda school girl stole them from another player's 
computer. Now Stephen Milne is facing rape charges. The player denies the allegations.

'It’s
 just reprehensible. I was flabbergasted – in the scheme of all the 
things we’ve been through, that would have been one thing I could never 
have predicted that we would deal with,' Demetriou said on radio.

Appropriate response? AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou started laughing uncontrollably when confronted on a talk show with details of the incident

The AFL boss later said he was laughing because he thought it was a joke and described the act as 'reprehensible'

'My
 giggling wasn’t about the situation, it was more about this is just 
another thing that’s happened which I couldn’t have predicted.

'It wasn’t meant to be offensive and I apologise to anyone who is offended. I wasn’t directing my laughter at him.'

He said the AFL would work with the club to investigate what happened. The St Kilda club is also investigating the incident.

Earlier Josh Damman, another co-entertainer with Johnston, demanded an apology from Demetriou.

'Had it been a female entertainer that was set on fire, would he be laughing?' he said on his Facebook page today. Surely there would be an outrage made about it.'

Victoria Police spokeswoman Creina O’Grady said police were looking into the allegation that the entertainer's clothes were set on fire with a cigarette lighter.

Player Leigh Montagna got in touch with an booking firm to organise entertainment for the Mad Monday celebrations.

he wrote: 'We
 are looking for two midgets that can entertain our guests on arrival. 
Maybe scare/shock them, banter with them etc as guests arrive?

'Dressed up in something that can scare/shock the guests.'

After the night, Mr Johnston sent an email to Montagna politely asking for his burnt clothes to be replaced.

Montagna's response, sent on Tuesday:

'If
 you actually followed your job description and said you would entertain
 us I would be happy to, but to sit on a seat and drink water for two 
hours and still want your money does not constitute work in my book.

'I
 am so sorry if you felt your clothes were affected but I also feel 
ripped off that I paid you money to entertain and you did not make any 
effort to try and entertain.

'If you felt we were disrespectful you should have tole me when I asked but you said everything was OK so I believed you.'

His employers, Dwarf My Party and Professional Championship Wrestling, are demanding answers from the club.

PCW wrote on its Facebook page: 'Could you please comment on why our on-screen president, known to spectators as Mr Big, was set on fire during your Mad Monday celebrations?'

A spokesman for PCW said: 'We are utterly disgusted by the situation.'

The friend said Johnston was slightly hurt in the incident, but was too embarrassed to see a doctor.

'He is very upset. You don't know what this does to someone's self-esteem."

He said PCW was forced to ask for answers on social media after the club involved did not respond to their phone calls earlier today.

'We rang them. We got nothing,' he said. 'We messaged them. Nothing. We got impatient, so we went to Facebook.

'Come on, this is not OK. We want answers. Now!'

The sick joke resonated with another attack on a dwarf in the UK earlier this year, resulting in the victim dying. 

Lee Webster tipped a lethal 27 mirtazapine sleeping tablets into his dwarf friend Jason Wood’s beer can when he left it to go to the toilet, in a pub in Ramsgate, Kent.

Mr Wood died three hours later.

Mr Webster, who said he did it as a joke, was convicted of manslaughter in June and jailed for five years.
