Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured in his Witney constituency, insisted the Philpott case raised questions about the welfare state

The case of child killer Mick Philpott does raise ‘wider questions’ about Britain’s benefits system, David Cameron insisted last night.

The Prime Minister defied vitriolic attacks from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to back Chancellor George Osborne in arguing that the Philpott case highlights the need for reform of the welfare system.

In a direct reference to the case, Mr Cameron said welfare handouts should not be seen as a ‘lifestyle choice’.

He added: ‘I think what George Osborne said was absolutely right.

‘He said Philpott was the one to blame for his crimes, that he should be held responsible.

'But what the Chancellor went on to say was that we should ask some wider questions about our welfare system, how much it costs and the signals that it sends.

‘And we do want to make clear that welfare is there to help people who work hard, it shouldn’t be there as a sort of lifestyle choice, and that’s entirely legitimate.’

Mr Cameron’s intervention in the row underlines Tory determination not to back down in the growing national debate sparked by public outrage over the Philpott case.

Philpott, a father of 17, was jailed for life on Thursday for the manslaughter of six of his children after setting fire to the family home in Derby. His wife Mairead and accomplice Paul Mosley were each jailed for 17 years.

'Why are we funding lifestyles like that?' Chancellor George Osborne has linked the case of jobless father-of-17 Mick Philpott (right), who was jailed for life for killing six of his children in a house fire, to the need for reform of the benefits system

The jury at Nottingham Crown Court 
had heard that one of the motivations for Philpott’s crimes was his 
desire to get his hands on the benefits money which vanished when his 
live-in lover left with their five children.

Did the benefits system contribute to the Philpott fire killings?

Philpott, who had not worked for 
almost a decade, is said to have enjoyed an income equivalent to that of
a £100,000 salary as a result of the benefits and earnings of his wife 
and his lover.

Mr Osborne faced a ferocious attack 
from Labour and many Lib Dems after saying the Philpott case raised 
questions about whether the taxpayer should be ‘subsidising lifestyles 
like that’.

Lib Dem president Tim Farron described Mr Osborne’s comments as ‘incendiary and incredibly stigmatising’.

Former Lib Dem children’s minister 
Sarah Teather said: ‘I am shocked and appalled that George Osborne has 
stooped so low as to make a crude political point out of the tragic 
deaths of six young children.’

Senior Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott 
even suggested Mr Osborne should consider resigning.

‘If George Osborne 
can’t see how wrong it is to play politics with six children’s deaths 
he’s not fit to be Chancellor,’ he said.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘We 
should have a proper debate about welfare reform. But for the Chancellor
to link this wider debate to this shocking crime is nasty and divisive 
and demeans his office.’

Even Mr Osborne’s Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander refused to back him yesterday, saying politicians should ‘let that case lie’.

But senior Tories believe there is 
widespread support for further reform of the welfare state – and 
revulsion at those seen as milking it.

Downing Street sources said Mr 
Cameron believed further radical reforms of the welfare system were 
needed, although these are unlikely before the election because of Lib 
Dem opposition.

Tory MP Dominic Raab said it was completely legitimate to debate the wider issues raised by the Philpott case.

On the attack: Labour's Dame Anne Begg and Shadow work and pensions minister Stephen Timms have accused Osborne of acting 'cynically'

He said: ‘Nothing can excuse the individual moral and criminal responsibility for this crime.

‘But we would be abdicating our 
responsibility as a society if we did not look at whether there is some 
link with the climate of dependency that our bloated welfare system has 
helped to create.’

Some Labour figures also warned there was a danger that Labour would end up on the wrong side of public opinion.

Philip Collins, a former speech 
writer to Tony Blair, said: ‘The grotesque Mick Philpott became the 
stooge embodiment of all that is said to be wrong with a culture in 
which the idle take the rise out of the working population.

‘We may look back on this as the week
in which the Coalition began to speak again to the British public while
the forgetful Labour party slunk back on to the sofa.’

Former Labour general secretary Peter
Watt said Labour was in danger of becoming the ‘party of the poor’ that
‘does not really care about the middle classes’.

The reaction from the opposition front bench was condemned by Labour activist and blogger Dan Hodges, who said Mr Balls had ‘plunged’ into a trap set by the Tories.

‘Labour’s strategy on Philpott and welfare is suicidal,’ he said. ‘The Tories want lots of stories tomorrow that have the phrases “Mick Philpott”, “Welfare”, and “Labour defends welfare”. They’re going to get them.

‘You don’t need to be a master strategist to make a monkey of the Labour Party on the issue of welfare. Labour should back a welfare freeze, in the same way it backs a freeze in public sector wages.’

Mr Hodges added that on Philpott Labour should say: ‘We’re not  commenting. This is a terrible tragedy, our thoughts are with the victims.’
