Harrowing footage of the moments after Sydney police officer Bill Crews was fatally shot has been played at an inquest into his death.

Constable Crews was 26 and a new recruit to the NSW Police Middle Eastern Organised Crime squad when he was shot during a 2010 drugs raid in the basement car park of a western Sydney unit block.

Small-time drug dealer Philip Nguyen was last year jailed for his manslaughter. Nguyen had taken a hit of heroin or ice on the night of September 8, 2010, and was the first to open fire as police officers descended the stairs to the car park.

But it was Detective Senior Constable Dave Roberts who fired the fatal shot, Const Crews' inquest has heard.

The inquest found that Constable Crews was actually shot dead by one of his own colleagues

'Tragically, the shot fired by Detective Senior Constable Roberts was the shot that killed Constable Crews,' counsel assisting Dean Jordan SC said at Glebe Coroner's Court.

Footage aired on the opening day of the inquest did not capture the moment a bullet hit Const Crews in the neck but did record gunshots ringing out in quick succession.

Officers can then be seen taking cover, yelling: 'Get back ... Get down, get on the ground'.

For five excruciating minutes, police can be seen pleading for an unseen gunman to 'throw the gun out and surrender'.

'We need to help our mate,' one officer is heard to yell out, as others call for an ambulance.

But Mr Jordan said that for most of the time Const Crews lay injured on the basement floor, Nguyen was in a unit upstairs - though the officers mistakenly believed he was still inside one of the basement garages.

'Under that mistaken belief, the officers could not attend to Constable Crews without placing themselves and their colleagues in danger,' Mr Jordan said.

It was standing room only on Monday as Mr Jordan delivered his opening address to NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes.

He said the inquest would investigate whether police search procedures in 2010 were adequate, whether they were adhered to on the night of Const Crews' death and whether plain-clothes detectives properly identified themselves as police.

Among the witnesses slated to give evidence is Nguyen, who is expected to tell the inquest he did not realise the men advancing toward him on the night of the raid were police officers.

The inquest continues.
