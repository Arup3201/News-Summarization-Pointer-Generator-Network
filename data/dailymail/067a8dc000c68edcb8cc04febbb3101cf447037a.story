The average Briton spends almost a year of their working life off sick, new research has revealed

The average Briton spends almost a year of their working life off sick, new research has revealed.

Workers take an average of 360 days sick leave during a standard 45 year career.

The finding means we spend almost a year-and-a-half of our working lives off work as there are on average 252 days in a working year.

But a third of full-time workers - 36 per cent - would only receive Statutory Sick Pay of £86.70 a week as they have no company sick policy.

The National Sickness Report surveyed 2,000 full-time workers to look at their current health and gauge their attitudes towards sickness.

Stress and depression are now the most common causes of long-term absence in the workplace and require an average recovery time of 81 days.

That means workers who are absent with either illness and are without a company sick policy could end up thousands of pounds out of pocket.

According to the Office for National Statistics, the average UK wage is £26,664.

It means workers at the mercy of Statutory Sick Pay could lose on average £4,671 if they collected just £86.70 a week over 81 days.

Mark Jones, from LV= who carried out the survey, said: ‘Often when we talk about workplace absence we look at the cost to businesses.

‘However, we wanted to highlight the impact that being off sick can have on an individual’s finances and lifestyle.

‘The fact that one in three would only receive Statutory Sick Pay indicates that many would be out of pocket and struggling financially.

‘It could be worse if they were off work for a long period of time and our findings show many people are.’

According to latest figures, 131 million working days are lost annually in Britain due to sickness - the equivalent of eight days per worker.

But almost half - 44 per cent - of workers who have been off sick have returned to work early due to financial concerns.

In fact, the research revealed Britons are quite unprepared for a bout of sickness as more than half - 52 per cent - didn’t know what they would be entitled to.

Mr Jones said: ‘Whilst no one wants to think about getting ill, unfortunately none of us are invincible.

‘The reality is that some people will need to be off work for a large chunk of time.

‘When we buy a car, a washing machine or even a phone we resign ourselves to the fact that at some point it might breakdown.

‘However, far too few of us have a back-up plan in place that would protect our income if we found ourselves unable to work.

‘Having a contingency plan, such as income protection, offers peace of mind so if we become ill we can focus on recovering.’
