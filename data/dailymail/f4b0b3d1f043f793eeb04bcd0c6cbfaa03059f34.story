He stepped out of prison this morning into the arms of his wife looking decidedly pale compared with her glowing wag-like looks.

So it would be no surprise if disgraced former MSP Tommy Sheridan dropped into the tanning salon to celebrate his early release after serving just over one year of his three-year sentence for lying under oath.

The 47-year-old walked out of Castle Huntly prison near Dundee shortly after 10am with his wife, Gail, vowing to appeal his conviction.

The politician and former Celebrity 
Big Brother contestant was jailed on January 26 last year for committing
perjury during his successful defamation action against the News of the
World in 2006.

He was awarded £200,000 in damages 
after winning the civil case but a jury at the High Court in Glasgow 
found him guilty of lying about the now-defunct tabloid's claims that he
was an adulterer who visited a swingers' club.

During his trial it was alleged that 
he had sex with Katrine Trolle, a Scottish Socialist Party member, in 
his marital bed. It was also claimed that she was involved in a 
threesome with Sheridan and his brother-in-law.

Miss Trolle said she had a fling with the former MSP for several years, but he denies ever having slept with her.

Trial judge Lord Bracadale 
subsequently handed the former leader of the Scottish Socialist Party a 
three-year jail sentence, telling him his decision to pursue the Sunday 
tabloid for defamation 'brought the walls of the temple crashing down' 
on him.

Speaking outside his Glasgow home, 
Sheridan said he intends to launch a fresh appeal against his 
conviction, and fight for an independent Scotland.

He also claimed the prospect of a 'gagging order' against him was lifted earlier today.

Together, the Sheridans and their lawyer, Aamer Anwar, told reporters they would try and get his conviction overturned

Sheridan said: 'It is a relief to be 
able to speak personally for once. It seems a long time now since I have
been able to speak.

'It's been an absolute delight to be 
back home with my beautiful wife who I love dearly, and my daughter 
Gabrielle who I have missed beyond words are able to describe.

'Up until a couple of hours ago, I 
didn't know I was going to be able to speak. Up until a couple of hours 
ago I was still gagged.

'I was told two hours ago that that 
gag has now been lifted. Unfortunately, although I am not to be gagged 
today, I will be tagged.'

He
added: 'I want to thank the thousands of ordinary folk across Scotland 
and further afield who have taken time to write to me, send me cards and
letters, contact me on Facebook and to show their solidarity with me 
and my family throughout this difficult 12 months.

'I
would like to thank them for being so human and so warm and respecting 
the fact that although we lost a trial in December of last year, we will
continue to fight to clear my name.

'And we are determined to highlight the contrasts in treatment between the 20-plus - I've lost count of the number of - News of the World former journalists who have been arrested.

'I have not read of any of them who have had their homes raided over a mammoth nine-hour search, or their children traumatised in the interests of justice.

'Apparently they handed themselves in at the stations. Well, I've got news for them and for others: this fight is far from over. This story has not yet finished. I believe that I will return to Glasgow High Court in the near future.'

Sheridan claimed 'witnesses' had lied during his perjury trial and said he would have 'a strong appeal that will hopefully lead to the quashing of my unfair, unsafe and unsound conviction'.

He added: 'I have to also say, however, that in the 12 months I have been away, things have not got any better for ordinary working-class folk. Wages have been cut, prices have increased and the Con-Dem millionaire Government wants to make ordinary folk pay for a crisis that was nothing to do with them.

'I look forward to re-engaging in the battle for justice and against inequality and poverty, and I also look forward to engaging in the campaign to deliver Scotland not just as an independent country but as an independent socialist country as well.

'I thank once again all of those who have stuck by me, my family and my friends. But most of all, I thank my wife Gail.'

His lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said the new appeal is related to the outcome of the police investigation into alleged perjury during Sheridan's trial.

Mr Anwar said: 'Tommy is delighted to be back at home with his family. He intends to make up for lost time as best he can.

'I have been instructed to prepare a 
new appeal which will be related to the outcome of Strathclyde Police's 
investigation into allegations of phone hacking and perjury at Tommy's 
trial.

'Tommy was told 
before Christmas by the Scottish Prison Service that on release he could
not speak directly to the media. Such a condition would have been a 
draconian attack on his right to free speech.

'Over the weekend we stated this would
be illegal and challenged it in the courts. The authorities have come 
to their senses and a gagging order will not be imposed.'

Sheridan will be tagged later today and under the terms of his release will have to stay at home between 7.15pm and 7.15am.

Before they returned to a party inside the house, Mr and Mrs Sheridan shared an emotional kiss on their doorstep.

Sheridan's
trial was one of the longest of its kind in Scottish legal history. He 
was convicted of five out of six allegations in a single charge of 
perjury, relating to his evidence during the civil action at the Court 
of Session in Edinburgh.

During
the three-month High Court trial, Sheridan claimed he was the victim of
a 'vendetta' by the police and a 'conspiracy' involving the Sunday 
newspaper and former colleagues within the SSP.

In August last year he was denied the chance to appeal against his conviction, following a ruling by senior judges.

Sheridan - who previously served time as part of an anti-poll tax campaign and then over an anti-Trident protest at Faslane nuclear submarine base - maintained his innocence through the trial.

He claimed he was the victim of a 'vendetta' by the police and a 'conspiracy' involving the News of the World and colleagues within the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP).

NOVEMBER 2004: Sheridan sues News of the World after it publishes series of stories alleging adultery and visits to a swingers' club.

AUGUST 2006: Politician denies allegations in court and jury awards him £200,000 in damages against News Group Newspapers.

OCTOBER 2006: His testimony seems to be blown apart after News of the World publishes secretly-recorded videotape in which Sheridan admits having visited sex club.

DECEMBER 2007: Sheridan arrested as he leaves Edinburgh radio station and charged with perjury.

FEBRUARY 2008: Gail Sheridan, who acted as supporting witness to her husband, also charged with perjury.

OCTOBER 2010: Couple's perjury trial begins.

DECEMBER 17: Gail Sheridan acquitted.

DECEMBER 23: Tommy Sheridan convicted of perjury.

JANUARY 26 2011: Sheridan jailed for three years.

The former SSP leader said 16 former 
allies  were lying as part of a 'political civil war' when they told the
High Court in Glasgow that he had admitted at a 2004 meeting having 
been to Cupid's swingers' club in Manchester.

Sheridan, who conducted his own defence, called Andy Coulson to give evidence during the sensational trial.

But the jury found him guilty of 
perjury during the 2006 civil defamation case and lying about having an 
affair with SSP member Katrine Trolle.

In a 50-minute plea before sentencing,
Sheridan asked for a 'proportionate and reasonable' sentence and 
referring to previous perjury cases, including those of former 
Conservative MPs Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aiken, said: 'This is not a
murder trial. Nobody has been killed and neither has an innocent person
been imprisoned.'

But the judge, Lord Bracadale, while 
praising him as a 'hard-working' politician, added:' When perjury is 
established it must be dealt with seriously for the benefit of the court
and the public.

'You embarked on an action in the 
Court of Session knowing that, for it to be successful, you would be 
required to tell lies under affirmation.

'You committed perjury and you were awarded a very large sum in damages. The only appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment.'

Any prisoner serving a sentence of 
less than four years is currently eligible for automatic early release 
at the halfway point in their jail term.

Sheridan would therefore be entitled to be freed from prison after 18 months.

However, under current provisions, it is possible for individuals to spend up to the last six months of their sentence on home detention curfew.

This means they can be freed from prison to live at home but must wear an electronically monitored tag for the remainder of their sentence.

At the weekend Sheridan's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said he had been told that prison authorities would try to 'gag' him on his release.

Mr Anwar promised to seek a judicial review if a public-speaking ban features in Sheridan's release conditions.

Speaking on Saturday, Mr Anwar said: 'I was aware that this was being imposed. It's unprecedented, absolutely draconian and denies my client the right to earn a living.'
