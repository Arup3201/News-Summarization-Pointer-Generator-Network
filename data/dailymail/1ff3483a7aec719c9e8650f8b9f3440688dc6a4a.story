Plunging house prices have triggered a new negative equity crisis, with the North bearing a far greater burden than the South, a report revealed yesterday.

Hundreds of thousands more families have become trapped in the nightmare of having a mortgage bigger than the value of their home over the last 18 months.

The report, from the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s, said 3.6 per cent of mortgage-holders were in ‘negative equity’ during the spring of 2010. By the end of last year, the number had risen to 5.6 per cent.

But those in the North are hurting more than those in the South.

The report’s author, Mark Boyce, 
estimates that about 8.5 per cent of homeowners in the North are in 
negative equity, compared with only 3.3 per cent in the South.

This is because house prices have 
fallen dramatically in many parts of the North since the credit crunch 
struck in 2007, but have reached record levels in parts of the South.

Official figures from the Land 
Registry show that the price of the average home in the North East 
peaked at £129,402 in October 2007.

Today it is worth £99,385, a drop of 
about £30,000, equal to a 23 per cent fall. This makes  the North East 
Britain’s negative equity hotspot with nearly 12 per cent of homebuyers
affected.

By contrast, homeowners in London have seen their property’s 
value reach an all-time high, with an average price of £354,300.

To make
matters worse, the number of homeowners who are on the brink of falling
into negative equity has also grown rapidly.

Over the same period, the  percentage 
whose mortgage equals 90 per cent or more of the value of their property
has jumped from 13.5 per cent to 16.6 per cent.

In Standard and Poor’s research, ‘the 
North’ is classified as the East Midlands, West Midlands, North East, 
North West, Yorkshire & Humber, Wales and Scotland.

‘The South’ is East Anglia, London, the South East and the South West.

Mr Boyce said one of the  big worries 
facing homeowners is the struggle to find a  new mortgage after the 
equity  in their home has dropped sharply.

Banks and building societies will give their cheapest deals only to homeowners who have a deposit of at least 20 per cent.

Standard and Poor’s does  not 
calculate how many are in negative equity, but the  Council of Mortgage 
Lenders’ latest estimate put the total  at around 830,000, lower  than 
the 1.6million peak in the early 1990s.

Paul Smee, director general of the CML, said negative equity does not necessarily trigger a problem with mortgage repayments.
