Police have seized a blood-splattered luxury sports car
allegedly tied to the murder of a Chicago area bride who was found dead in the
bathtub just days after her May wedding.

The vehicle, a 2006 black Masertai, was discovered in the
garage belonging to the groom's brother after he was arrested on unrelated drug
charges last month. 

Estrella Carrera, 26, was found stabbed to death in her
Burbank home on May 13, just two days after she married her boyfriend, 30-year-old
Arnaldo Jimenez, in a City Hall ceremony.

At the time of her
death, the mother of two was still clad in her silver cocktail dress in which
she had celebrated her nuptials.

The victim's new husband, who disappeared after the murder,
was quickly named a suspect, and a federal warrant for first-degree murder was
issued for his arrest. Jimenez was last
seen driving the Masertai en route to Mexico.

However, when his brother, 26-year-old Humberto Jimenez, was
taken into custody in connection to a drug ring last month, police discovered
the luxury sedan with Illinois license plate L641441 under a blanket in his garage on Mozart Street, according to ABC7.

According to officials, the inside of the vehicle was
covered in blood which someone had apparently tried to clean up.

Investigators now believe that Carrera was stabbed in the
car and moved to the bathtub, according to CBS2. Humberto Jimenez then allegedly drove Arnaldo in
the car to La Caldena, Mexico.

'It's a major part of the investigation, especially in terms
of physical evidence,' said Capt. Joseph Ford. 'All the holes are being patched
and we'll feel more confident once he's arrested.'

This theory is supported by wiretapped conversations which
reveal that Humberto Jimenez was with his brother as he fled to the U.S.-Mexico
border.

In recordings made a day after Carrera's murder, Arnaldo
Jimenez could be heard telling friends that 'there's an emergency' and a 'huge
problem,' the Chicago Sun-Times reported. 

Cell phone records allowed police to track Jimenez as far as
Hidalgo, Mexico. There is a $10,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest and prosecution of Arnaldo Jimenez.

Ford added that while he is not sure how big of a priority
it is for Mexican police to arrest Jimenez, he said that ‘it will never go
away,’ and that he hopes to be around when the 30-year-old is caught.  

Humberto Jimenez was among 27 people arrested around the
country on September 27 and charged with drug offenses. A total of 39
defendants are facing drug charges in the investigation.

According to prosecutors, Jimenez and another accused drug
ring leader Jesus Ramirez-Padilla led their own drug-trafficking organizations
that bought and sold powder cocaine on Chicago's southwest side. He has not
been charged in connection with Carrera's murder or his brother's escape.

The bloodied Maserati car is now in the custody of the
Burbank Police Department.

An FBI warrant states
that Jimenez used his cell phone on May 12, a day after his wedding, in
the Chicago area. He continued using it through southern Illinois, near
Memphis, Tennessee, through Arkansas and then into Texas.

The warrant also confirms information
that Carrera’s family revealed about an emotional call Jimenez made to 
his sister, allegedly telling her that he had left his wife bleeding 
after a ‘bad fight.’

Another ‘close associate of Jimenez’ 
told authorities that Jimenez told him ‘he was leaving the state of 
Illinois, and if questioned by law enforcement, the associate should 
tell law enforcement he went to Mexico.’

Jimenez
is a Texas native who owns property there in the city of Pharr, 
according to the warrant. His parents currently live in Mexico, and he 
also has relatives residing in North Carolina.

Authorities began looking for Jimenez soon after Carrera's family reported that she failed to pick up her two children, ages two and ten, as she had arranged. The family had been unable to reach Carrera or Jimenez, so they asked police to check on her at her apartment in the suburb of Burbank.

That is when the 26-year-old’s body was found in the bathtub, still clothed in the party dress she also may have worn at her wedding ceremony at Chicago's City Hall. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera’s apartment, according to investigators.

That day, the bride's family received a haunting phone call from a sister of her new husband, who told them he had called her weeping and said that he had left his bride bleeding after a ‘bad fight.’

Most of Carrera's family disapproved of her three–year relationship with Jimenez, even though he was the father of her two-year-old son.

Jimenez had hit and bruised Carrera in the past, according to Carrera’s older sister, Jazmin. Police also said family members reported incidents of violence while the couple was dating. 

Jazmin Carrera described Jimenez as ‘very possessive’ and jealous. She said she does not understand why her sister married the 30-year-old in what seemed like a rushed ceremony that the bride had kept secret from almost everyone.

Jazmin Carrera received a text message from her sister two days before the wedding, inviting her to join them and their friends at a Mexican restaurant and a nightclub to celebrate the nuptials.

She chose not to attend.

‘It was just all of a sudden,’ Jazmin Carrera said. ‘She didn't give us enough notice.’

The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, according to officials.

On Sunday, relatives heard about the phone call from Jimenez's sister, who said that when she tried to call her brother back, he would not pick up, according to Jazmin Carrera.

Authorities made a plea to Jimenez to turn himself in ‘for the sake of his family and especially his children,’ Ford said.

Investigators do not believe Jimenez is a danger to others, although they say they have no way of knowing his current state of mind.
