A thoroughly deflated Gary Cahill described England’s 2-1 defeat to Uruguay as the lowest point of his career.

England are on the verge of elimination from the World Cup thanks to Luis Suarez’s deadly double in Sao Paulo.

For England to qualify they need Italy to win their final two matches while the Three Lions must also beat Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte and hope they have a good enough goal difference.

Down and almost out: Cahill has that sinking feeling after the defeat to Uruguay

But Cahill thinks England are almost certainly out, judging by his mood after the match in Sao Paulo.

'It’s the worst feeling I have had as a player,' the England centre-back said.

'A few weeks ago this (the World Cup) was one of the highlights of my career and a couple of weeks down the line it’s one of the lowest points.

'The next four days are going to seem like forever. We just hope that Italy can perform really well in the next two games and leave the last game to try and get a win and that’s all we can do but we realise it’s going to be very tough.'

Big moment: Cahill can't prevent Luis Suarez smashing home Uruguay's winner

Despite having knee surgery just four-and-a-half weeks ago, Suarez chased the England defence down all night.

The controversial Liverpool striker sneaked in behind Cahill to head past Joe Hart in the first half and he wrapped up the win when he capitalised on a mistake by Steven Gerrard.

Cahill believes the Uruguayan was very lucky with his second goal.

'He has a lot of energy and he is a great finisher, but sometimes as a forward you get a bit of luck,' the Chelsea defender said.

'He took his first goal very well. For the second goal he was very, very fortunate.

England had other chances to clinch the win, and Cahill believes the team were unfortunate to lose.

'I thought we gave a good account of ourselves,' said Cahill, who won his 26th cap on Thursday.

'I have played in teams a lot worse than this and come away with wins.

'Joe (Hart) came off and he said to me that he has had five or six shots on target to deal with over the two games and we have conceded four goals. It’s very tough to take. Sometimes football can be cruel.'

Meanwhile, Phil Jagielka knows a remarkable turn of events are needed if they are to avoid becoming the first England side since 1958 to crash out at the World Cup group stage.

'There’s a small chance but we are not exactly expecting something like that,' the centre-back said.

'We have to go out there and give a good performance against Costa Rica.

'We had them on the back foot. I’m not sure what went on with Daniel Sturridge’s penalty appeal, and we had a couple of chances, but obviously we just weren’t able to get that second goal.

'It it is a similar story to the Italy game. We played pretty well but not good enough.'

Asked to sum up his feelings, Jagielka added: 'Gutting. We played so well again in spells.

'It didn’t go our way with Steven (Gerrard) flicking the ball on, and you just hope that he mishits one, but he hit the target and they win the game.

'We’ve not seen it again, but as a defender that’s the last thing you want to see. A punt down the pitch, a flick-on and a goal.

'As you can tell by my voice, everyone is absolutely devastated.'
