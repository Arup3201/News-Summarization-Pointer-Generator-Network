Former Major League pitcher Curt Schilling has blamed years of chewing tobacco for his mouth cancer.

The 47-year-old told WEEI radio in Boston that he is in remission from mouth cancer.

But he'll ‘go to his grave’ believing he got sick because he chewed smokeless tobacco for 30 years.

He told WEEI: ‘I’ll go to my grave believing that was why I got what I got.’

‘Absolutely.
 No question in my mind about that. … I do believe without a doubt, 
unquestionably, that chewing is what gave me cancer.

Mr Schilling, a well-known pitcher lost 75 pounds during his treatment.

He also revealed how he lost his senses of taste and smell.

In February Mr Schilling announced he had cancer but he was in remission by June.

The baseball legend said he took a few months to recover from his ordeal.

But
 was keen to talk about his battle with cancer during a fundraiser for 
the Jimmy Fund, the juvenile charity with whom the Boston Red Sox 
partner.

He
 added: ‘I’m not going to sit up here from the pedestal and preach about
 chewing. I will say this: I did for about 30 years. It was an addictive
 habit.’

‘I can think about so many times in my life when it was so relaxing to just sit back and have a dip and do whatever.

‘And
 I lost my sense of smell, my taste buds for the most part, I had gum 
issues, they bled, all this other stuff. None of it was enough to ever 
make me quit.

'The
 pain I was in going through this treatment, the second or third day, it
 was the first thing and the only thing in my life that I’ve ever had 
that I wish I could go back and never have dipped. Not once. It was so 
painful.'
