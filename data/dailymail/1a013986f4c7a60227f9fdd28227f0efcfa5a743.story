A New York City police officer who was seen on video punching an Occupy Wall Street protester in the face in 2011 has been awarded a tax-free disability pension of $120,000 a year for the injuries he sustained in the melee.

Deputy Inspector Johnny Cardona made headlines when he drove a fist into Felix Rivera-Pitre's face during a chaotic demonstration in Manhattan’s Financial District on October 14, 2011.

Police accused Rivera-Pitre, who is HIV positive, of being the aggressor in the confrontation, which started when the former dancer allegedly tried to elbow the cop in the face.

One-percenter: NYPD Inspector Cardona, seen in this October 14, 2011 photo, hitting protester Felix Rivera-Pitre (green shirt) during an Occupy Wall Street has been awarded a tax-free disability pension of $120,000 a year for his injuries

Difference of opinions: The NYPD accused Rivera-Pitre of provoking Johnny Cardona by trying to elbow him in the face, but the protester insisted that all he did was give the officer 'a look'

Footage from the protest shows Cardona pursuing Rivera-Pitre and then taking a swing at him, causing the passerby to crumple to the ground.

However, Roy Richter, director of the Captains Endowment Association, claimed that a video shot from a different angle that day shows Cardona in a headlock and being trampled.

According to the official, the deputy inspector suffered serious back injuries and required a hip replacement surgery and operations on both his knees, the New York Daily News reported. 

The Daily News reported that earlier this week, the NYPD pension board signed off on a disability pension for Cardona, which is three quarters tax-free and amounts to about $120,000 a year.

One-time deal: Rivera-Pitre, seen  in the center during an Occupy march in September 2012, sued the NYPD and received a $55,000 settlement

Rivera-Pitre said the cop's punch tore the earring from his left ear, leaving the HIV-positive man bleeding on the ground

Rivera-Pitre has sued the NYPD and received a one-time settlement of $55,000.

The man's attorney, Ron Kuby, was scandalized to learn of Cardona's pension.

‘What’s his disability?’ he asked the Daily News. ‘He hurt his fist when he punched Occupy Wall Street protesters? If he went out on a psychological disability that would have been appropriate.’

Speaking to Gothamist after the clash with police, Rivera-Pitre said that he was walking on William Street during the protest and 'shot the cop a look,' which angered the officer, later identified as Cardona, causing him to lunge at him.

The fire in his belly: Rivera-Pitre, an artist and former dancer, continued participating in the Occupy movement after the 2011 incident

Cardona’s punch tore out the earring from Rivera-Pitre's left ear, leaving the HIV-positive man bleeding on the ground.

However, then-37-year-old Rivera-Pitre was able to escape thanks to the reigning commotion and avoided being arrested.
