The likelihood of London becoming home to an NFL franchise has increased with American football bosses planning five games in the capital next year, the MoS can reveal.

NFL officials are bullish about the demand for extra matches in London and are confident they can fill Wembley for five games. 

This season the NFL added an extra Wembley game, with tickets for all three selling out, including Sunday’s match between the Atlanta Falcons and the Detroit Lions.

The additional games, which would lay the groundwork for a permanent London franchise, are expected to be announced in the coming month.

Chancellor George Osborne insists the Government will do what it can to help bring a franchise to London. This week research into the benefits of such a move will be published and is likely to be very positive about the city as an NFL hub.
