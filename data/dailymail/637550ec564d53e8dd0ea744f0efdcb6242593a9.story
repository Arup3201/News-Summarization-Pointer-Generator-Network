Back in September, Mr Dromey also favourited a link to a Tweet on a similar theme

Labour frontbencher Jack Dromey was left red-faced after it emerged he added a Twitter link to a gay porn website to his list of ‘favourites’.

The shadow policing minister - who is married to Labour deputy leader, Harriet Harman - linked to a tweet about well-endowed black men.

The link showed a picture of two men engaged in a sex act.

This was the second occasion on which Mr Dromey’s finger had strayed on Twitter. Back in September, Mr Dromey also favourited a link to a Tweet on a similar theme.

At the time, the then shadow housing minister dismissed it as a mistake as he and Mrs Harman had been exploring romantic breaks in Paris.

According to the Guido Fawkes political gossip website, Mr Dromey said he had accidentally stumbled on the gay porn website - which featured a character called ‘Paris’.

Inside Housing covered the story in a diary item, saying: ‘Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey is the latest victim of this murky world after favouriting a tweet that featured a very different type of outstanding member to that normally found in the parliament.’

It is surprisingly easy for Twitter users to publicise embarrassing searches to all their followers by typing key words into the ‘Tweet’ box rather than the search engine.

But the revelation could cause tension with his staunchly feminist wife, Mrs Harman, who has called for the Sun newspaper to stop its ‘sexist’ pictures of topless women on page three.

The story was retweeted numerous times after being posted by Guido Fawkes yesterday.

A Labour source said: ‘This is a technological mix-up and we’re sure Jack will be taking Twitter lessons to work out the difference between block and favourite as soon as possible.’

The Mail understands that no one else has access to Mr Dromey’s account so the tweet cannot be blamed on a junior staff member.

‘It’s all very embarrassing. He is aware of it. It’s more mix up than conspiracy,’ one insider said.

Mr Dromey, a 65 year-old former trade union boss, was elected as the MP for Birmingham Erdington in 2010.

His selection was controversial as the usual all-woman shortlist championed by his wife, was bypassed.

Meanwhile it also emerged that David Cameron’s official twitter account followed an escort agency.

The @Number10gov account was following the @carltonslondon, which described itself as an ‘elite London escort agency’.

Downing Street blamed the gaffe on the ‘auto-follow’ facility which has been on the account since Gordon Brown was prime minister.

A spokesman said: ‘We have stopped following this particular account. Prior to 2010, an auto-follow process was used, meaning that @Number10gov automatically followed anyone who followed the account.

‘This was common practice at the time for many corporate accounts, but was discontinued in 2009.

‘As a result of this legacy, the @Number10gov account follows almost 370,000 accounts and we have taken steps to un-follow as many as possible that are inactive, spam or inappropriate.

‘This work is ongoing.’

Originally, Twitter users had pointed out that perhaps Mr Cameron had mistaken the escort agency for the Carlton Club, an exclusive private members’ club in London.

Official records showed that more than 300,000 attempts were made to access pornographic website in the Houses of Parliament last year.

About 5,000 people work on the parliamentary estate.
