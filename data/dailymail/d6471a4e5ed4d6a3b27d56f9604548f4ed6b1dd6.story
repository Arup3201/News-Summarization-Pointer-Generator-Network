L'Wren Scott tragically left the world in New York, but those close to her will be saying their final goodbyes to the designer in California.

At
 the request of her grief stricken partner Mike Jagger, her older 
brother, Randall Bambrough, has moved the funeral to the 
West Coast on Friday.

According
 to Page Six, the pair decided to have both a final viewing and 
funeral on the West Coast, where the 70-year-old rocker is currently 
residing.

Final farewell: L'Wren Scott's funeral will be held in Los Angeles, California, at the request of Mike Jagger, pictured in 2010, and her brother

The singer has only just flown back
 to the United States from Australia, where the Rolling Stones were on tour 
when he received the tragic news that the 49-year-old had taken her life.

The designer was found in her Manhattan apartment on Monday, with the coroner ruling it a suicide.

Jagger's spokesman confirmed to the MailOnline that he is in Los Angeles being comforted by his children - daughters Karis,
 Elizabeth, Georgia May and Jade as well as his son James. 

Scott's body is currently at a New York funeral home but will soon be flown to Los Angeles.

Page Six said: 'Scott’s body has been at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on Manhattan’s Upper East Side since Wednesday, when the Medical Examiner’s office released it after confirming her death was a suicide.'

Scott did not leave a note and many have speculated the stress of her business facing severe financial issues may have contributed to her hanging death.

The designer - who was raised in Utah - 
also has a sister, Jan Shane, however, according to Page 6 she has been 
barred from being part of the funeral.

Shane’s husband, Ron, told The Post: 'Randy is trying to keep Jan from being able to attend any services.'

The husband said that Shane and Scott had been close but had a falling out when their mother died six years ago.

Earlier this week, Scott's sister told MailOnline 
that she hoped she would be buried in the family's plot in Ogden, Utah, next to her adoptive parents.

As decisions were being made to 
farewell the designer, Jagger's band mates also returned back to 
America, having cancelled the Australian tour.

On Friday, Keith Richards, 
Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood, arrived at Manston airport, in Kent, 
aboard their logo-embossed private jet.

Frontier Touring has confirmed it is working on new dates for the 
Rolling Stones' Australian tour. Concert promoters said the band's shows
 may be held after the football season in either October or November, News.com.au reported.

On Wednesday night, the same night 
the Rolling Stones were due to perform in front of more than 15,000 
screaming fans for the first show of their sold-out tour, drummer 
Charlie Watts played to just 130 people at the city's tiny Ellington Jazz 
Club.

The impromptu gig followed Watts telling MailOnline that Mick Jagger had been left dazed and unwell following the apparent suicide on Monday.

'He's
 holding up. He's okay,' Watts said earlier that night, adding: 'He's 
not really well. He's not really here. It was such a shock.'
