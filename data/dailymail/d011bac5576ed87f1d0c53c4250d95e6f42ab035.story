A Los Angeles man was arrested and charged with murder after police say he intentionally crashed into an LAPD patrol car over the weekend, killing one officer and injuring another to stop them from pursuing his friend.

Roberto Sanchez, 32, a six-year veteran on the force, died at a hospital after the patrol car he was driving was broadsided by an SUV in the Harbor City area Saturday.

The squad car was so mangled that Sanchez's partner had to call for help on his personal cell phone because the police radio wasn't working.

LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said Sanchez, who only recently got married, was on patrol with his best friend and partner when the collision occurred.

The surviving officer, Richard Medina, was hospitalized with a broken jaw and other injuries. He was released home Monday.

Mynor Varela, 20, has been charged with second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, assault on a police officer and leaving the scene of an accident, Los Angeles Times reported. 

He pleaded not guilty to all counts Wednesday and is being held without bond. Varela’s next court date is June 11.

Varela's brother, 19-year-old Bryan Varela, was also detained in connection to the fatal hit-and-run crash because he was a passenger in the SUV.

During a press conference held Thursday morning, LAPD officials revealed that Varela intentionally rammed his Chevy Tahoe into Officer Sanchez's squad car while he and his partner were chasing a Chevrolet Camaro following a traffic violation.

At around 3.45am Saturday, the patrol car and the Camaro were driving eastbound on Anaheim Street in Harbor City and had just made a U-turn when Varela's SUV slammed into the LAPD vehicle on its driver's side.

‘He did this in order to aid a friend who was driving a Camaro that the police vehicle was following,’ said Beck.

Following the collision, Varela and his brother took off from the scene without helping the injured officers, according to police. Both men were taken into custody a short time later.

Officer Sanchez was rushed to a hospital after being extricated from the crumpled patrol car and died from his injuries soon after. An only child, Sanchez is survived by his parents and his wife of only three months.

The driver of the Camaro has been identified and interviewed by police, but he has not been arrested.

According to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Varela has a valid driver's license with no reportable accidents, citations or suspensions. His younger brother, however, had a prior conviction on a DUI charge and evading police, Orange County Register reported.

Mynor Varela’s attorney, Regina Filippon, lamented after Wednesday's court hearing that prosecutors were ‘throwing everything but the kitchen sink’ at him, even though he has no criminal record, according to MyFox LA.

Filippon also said that it remains unknown if police plan to file charges against her client’s sibling.

Sanchez was the third LAPD officer to die on the job recently. In March, 40-year-old Officer Nicholas Choung Lee was killed when his patrol car was hit by a dump truck in Beverly Hills.

Last month, 51-year-old motorcycle officer Chris Cortijo was struck and killed by a driver alleged to have been under the influence of cocaine.

Mayor Eric Garcetti ordered city flags lowered to half-staff.

'This third loss of an officer in the line of duty in just two months is a stark and tragic reminder of the dangers our first responders face every day,' Garcetti said in a statement.

The Los Angeles police union called Sanchez a hero.

'Today the world has lost a true hero. Roberto will be greatly missed as a protector of our society and even more as a person,' Los Angeles Police Protective League President Tyler Izen said in a statement.
