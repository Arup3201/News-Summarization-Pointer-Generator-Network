A mother has declared that she will risk a prison sentence for letting her son miss three days of school to attend her wedding.

Clare Whitelegg is furious that her nine-year-old son’s primary school refused her request for him to take time off lessons to watch her marry her police officer fiancé Andy McLeary.

The school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Defiant: Clare Whitelegg, 30, who is set to marry  fiance Andy McLeary, 37, tomorrow (pictured together, left) plans to take her son Riley Bryant (right) out of school for the wedding, even though his teachers refused him permission to miss lessons

But
 Miss Whitelegg, 30, who works for the police as a call handler, has 
pulled her son, Riley Bryant, out of lessons regardless.

She and Mr 
McLeary, 37, who live in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, are due to marry in her
 home town of Newquay, Cornwall, later today.

She
 insists she will refuse to pay any penalty notices imposed on her by 
Clive Church of England School near Shrewsbury and is prepared to face 
prosecution.

Sanctions that can be imposed on the parents of truanting children include a three-month jail sentence or a fine of £2,500.

The row follows a crackdown on term-time absence which removed heads’ discretion to grant up to ten days’ holiday a year.

Denied: Police communications operator Mrs McLeary wrote to Clive Church of England School in Shrewsbury, Shropshire (pictured), asking for permission to let Riley miss three days of lessons this week

Venue: Mr and Mrs McLeary married on this beach in her hometown of Newquay, marking the spot by writing this loving message in the sand

Education
 Secretary Michael Gove tightened the rules from last September to 
prevent unnecessary disruption to children’s education.

He ordered heads
 to stop granting permission for term-time holidays unless families 
could show ‘exceptional circumstances’ such as a family bereavement.

But
 Miss Whitelegg, who had Riley in a previous relationship, said: ‘It’s 
absolutely bonkers that the school have banned my son from attending my 
wedding.

‘If I had gone 
along with the school’s ruling then there would be no wedding because I 
can’t leave a nine-year-old home alone for three days.

Couple: Mrs and Mr McLeary, a police officer with West Mercia Police. Speaking before her wedding, she said: 'It's absolutely bonkers that the school have banned my son from attending my wedding'

Risk: If parents fail to ensure their children attend school, they may be issued with penalty notices of £50 to £100. Parents who fail to pay the penalty notices face prosecution by the council

'Andy and I both 
work full-time and this is the only time we could get off work.

‘Riley is an excellent pupil. The school isn’t even holding normal lessons this week anyway because it’s sports week.’

Schools
 and local councils can issue £120 spot fines if pupils are absent 
during term-time, although they are £60 if paid within 28 days. Parents 
who fail to pay the penalty notices face prosecution by the council.

Miss
 Whitelegg, who like her fiancé works for West Mercia Police, added: ‘I 
am fully prepared to go to court and I will refuse to pay any fine. If 
it means going to prison then so be it.’

Mary Lucas, head teacher at Clive school, said: ‘The school will only authorise leave in exceptional circumstances.

‘On
 June 16, 2014 we received an application for a pupil leave of absence 
from June 23 to 25. I would have been happy to talk to the parents about
 this request if they had come to see me.’
