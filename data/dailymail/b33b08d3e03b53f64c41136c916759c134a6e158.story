The principal of a Delaware middle school and her 10-year-old daughter have been killed in a car accident.

Delaware State police and the Milford School District confirmed that 42-year-old Tricia Martin of Camden died at Christiana Hospital following the 10:40pm crash Friday near Frederica. Her daughter Taryn Martin was pronounced dead at 12.45am Sunday at A.I. Dupont Children's Hospital.

A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. this Saturday for both at the Torbert Funeral Chapel in Dover, Delaware. The burial will immediately follow from 12.30 to 1pm at Lakeside Cemetary.

Unexplained: The mother and daughter were driving home around 10:20pm Friday night when their vehicle veered into the oncoming lane

According to the News Journal, Tricia Martin was driving a 2009 Acura MDX SUV westbound when her car crossed over into the eastbound lanes and veered off the road into a ditch, hitting a telephone box and fence.

'For unknown reasons the Acura crossed over the eastbound lanes and off the south side of the roadway where it drove along a ditch line, colliding with a telephone box and fence,' said police spokesperson Gary Fournier.

It then hit an embankment and flipped onto its side back onto the road in the eastbound lane.

Tricia Martin was in the car and her daughter got out to get help from a vehicle that had pulled over when another car hit both Taryn Martin and the Acura, pushing the car into the ditch and flipping it upright.

Martin was the principal of Milford Central Academy, which has more than 1,000 students in 6th through 8th grades

Tricia Martin was ejected from the car onto the road, and Taryn Martin was thrown onto the side of the road.

The driver of the second vehicle was taken to hospital and treated for minor injuries.

Martin was the beloved principal of Milford Central Academy, which has more than 1,000 students in 6th through 8th grades.

Milford superintendent Phyllis Kohel says Martinâ€™s death is 'heartbreaking' for the school district.

Another colleague of Martin, Milford School District director of student support Slyvia Henderson, called her an 'outstanding leader.''She had a way, when she walked into a room, to make you feel better about yourself. ... It's been a somber day, a somber weekend. We're very sad. We're very blessed that we had her in our lives,' Henderson told Delaware Online.

Teachers and students turned Martin's parking spot at the school into a memorial on Monday.

'We have to live the rest of the school year for her,' one note at the memorial reads.

'Dr. Martin is in a better place. Her and her daughter are,' says another, Delaware Online reports.

Tricia Martin's husband, John Martin, was a Navy reservist who served for a year in Iraq.
