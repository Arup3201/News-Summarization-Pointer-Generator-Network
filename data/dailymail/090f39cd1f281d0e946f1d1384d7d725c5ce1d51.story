Technology giants LG Electronics and Samsung are heading to court in a bizarre legal battle over claims  LG executives vandalised four Samsung washing machines at a trade show last year.

Jo Seong-jin, head of LG's home appliances department, and three other staff members have been indicted on charges of property damage and defamation.

LG hasn't denied their employees were present and looking at the washing machines when the vandalism is alleged to have occurred, but  claimed the products' doors were broken because their hinges were weak.

Although LG admits its executives were present, it denies allegations the products were vandalised

The company has also hit back publicly by releasing CCTV footage showing the incident itself and firing off public statements in defence of its staff members.

A lawyer for Mr Jo said: 'It is questionable whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that the president of a global company deliberately destroyed the machines where employees of the competing company were present,' The Wall Street Journal reported.

He added: 'The truth will be revealed in the courts.'

There were unsuccessful attempts by lawyers from both companies to mediate a solution before the charges were laid.

And LG has already paid for the four washing machines that were alleged to have been vandalised at the trade show, which was held in Berlin in September last year.

But it also responded by releasing the CCTV footage on YouTube, which said it showed the staff members looking at the products at the show in the presence of Samsung staff members, CNBC reported.
