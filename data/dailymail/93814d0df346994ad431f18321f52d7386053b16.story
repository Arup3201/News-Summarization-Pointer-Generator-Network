Mark Mellard, pictured, put the bottle containing sulphuric acid into his pocket when he was going to clean a drain, unfortunately the plastic container melted causing serious burns

A workman suffered severe burns after his leg was soaked in sulphuric acid - which burned through an Irn-Bru bottle.

Mark Mellard, 46, needed two skin grafts after putting the drinks bottle into his pocket unaware that colleague John Campey had filled it with the highly-corrosive liquid.

A court heard how his colleague decanted the heavy-duty drain cleaner from its container and left it next to a sink at the DHL Debenhams warehouse at Sherburn Industrial Estate in Selby, North Yorkshire.

Both Mr Mellard and his colleague believed the substance in the bottle to be a less corrosive drain cleaner.

After feeling his leg burning, Mr Mellard removed it and threw it away, before rushing to the toilets where he put cold water on his leg.

The pain stopped as his nerve endings were damaged, so Mr Mellard went home and walked the dog before going to hospital on June 20 last year.

He was kept in hospital for ten days and even had to spend two hours in a special decontamination unit.

Mr Mellard believes he was sacked as a result of the accident.

He said he tried to return to work three times but each time he was told he was suspended without pay, before finally losing his job. 

He said: 'I’ve been out of work since and it’s going to take two to four years for it to fully heal.'

Campey, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, and Mr Mellard have since lost their jobs at the warehouse.

Campey, who was a representative of the company’s Health and Safety committee and had undergone Care Of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) training, denied giving the acid to Mr Mellard, but said it had been left unattended.

He admitted two counts of breaching Health and Safety regulations.

Mark Monaghan, defending, said the sulphuric acid had only been in use at the facility for a week, replacing a weaker drain cleaner which had been previously used.

Mr Monaghan said: 'He put it into what he accepts now was not an appropriate container with the intention of going to clean the drain.

'He had certainly not realised that the new chemical which had been used from the week was considerably stronger and more caustic than the previous drain cleaner.

Mr Mellard suffered extensive burns, pictured, following the accident and has needed two skin grafts. According to medics it may take two years for the injuries to heal

'Although this is an offence that led to quite a bad injury, it is a case where the difficulty arose because of unfortunate error of judgement not through deliberate effort.

'In effect, he had to find a smaller container than the new large one that had been used from that week to find some chemical to apply to a blocked drain.'

Mr Mellard said he was also in the process of taking the company to an industrial tribunal, and although he and Campey used to be friends, they had not contacted each other since the incident last year.

Magistrates ordered Campey to carry out 60 hours unpaid work in the community and to pay £300 towards prosecution costs, and a £60 victim surcharge.

The court heard a civil action was also underway, over the matter of compensation for the injured man.

Tim Grogan, senior enforcement officer at Selby District Council, said: 'This case demonstrates that Selby District Council will prosecute where health and safety regulations have been breached, and particularly when serious injuries are the consequences.

'The magistrates recognised the gravity of the matter and I am satisfied with their findings.'

Mr Mellard's colleague John Campey filled the Irn-Bru bottle, pictured, with sulphuric acid. The company had previously used a less caustic drain cleaner that did not melt plastic bottles

Speaking after the case, Mr Mellard said: 'They sacked me for attempted theft of chemicals but I never stole anything. I was given it.

'I asked my colleague what he was doing and he said he was clearing a drain. I had a blocked drain at home so I asked him if I could have some of the drain cleaner he was using.

Mr Mellard said he has been scarred for life, pictured, after the accident and is currently in the process of taking a civil case against his former employers

'He gave me a bottle but I didn't know
 what the substance was inside. He left it on the side for me. I was 
leaving work so I put the bottle in my pocket with my keys. As I was 
walking out of the warehouse, the bottle burst.'

He said he tried to clean the acid from his leg with water before going home.

'I
 had no idea what it was so I didn't think it would be that bad. If I'd 
have known, I wouldn't have put my trousers back on but I did, which 
must have made it worse.

'I drove home wearing the trousers that were covered in acid and then washed them out.'

When he arrived in hospital, doctors asked him what what had caused the injuries and they transferred him to a decontamination unit for two hours before moving him to the burns unit.

'A couple of days later I had the first skin graft. They gave me a spinal anaesthetic so I actually watched the whole thing. I was sent home ten days later but I had to keep going back to have the dressings changed.'

Mr Mellard said: 'I tried going back to work about four weeks after it happened because I wasn't getting sick pay so I needed the money. As soon as I walked through the door, I was suspended. I tried to go back another three times but each time, I was suspended again until I was sacked.

'They also said I had breached the handling of chemicals but I was never trained in that any way so I couldn't have breached it.'

Mr Mellard said he hasn't seen his colleague since the accident but does not blame him for his misfortune.

He added: "John and I always used to talk. We got on, and we'd chat about the rugby.

'When it happened, John was by my side but he just left me to it and I went to the toilet to try and wash it off.

'I don't blame John. I don't believe he was trained properly.'

Mr Mellard's colleague transferred some of the sulphuric acid from the container, pictured to a small 500ml Irn-Bru bottle so he could take some of the liquid home to clean his own drains
