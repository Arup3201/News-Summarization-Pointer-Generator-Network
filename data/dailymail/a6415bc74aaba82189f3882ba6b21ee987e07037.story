Kevin Pietersen has posted a picture of himself being 'arrested' while on a night out with friends. 

The ex-England batsman, who has been heavily linked with a possible return to the international set-up in recent weeks, posed jokingly with police officers and posted the snap on his official Instagram account. 

Former Australia batsman Adam Gilchrist can be seen laughing in the background of the photo.

Pietersen was sacked as England captain by the ECB following the 2013-2014 Ashes defeat, but has set his heart on pushing for a return to the national fold in time for this summer's rematch. And in the wake of a hugely disappointing World Cup campaign, it is widely thought that England are in need of a shakeup.

The 34-year-old signed for Surrey on Wednesday to that end - and after indications from new ECB chairman Colin Graves that he may yet be considered again for selection, he is hoping a welter of county championship runs over the next two months could press his claims.
