Most of us will be somewhat guilty of indulging in a few - OK, quite a few - celebratory cocktails while ringing in 2014 this week.

But who knew how the order you place at a bar could speak volumes of your potential political leanings?

According to two years of consumer data gathered from GFK MRI and analyzed by the right-leaning National Media Research Planning and Placement, voting habits can be realized according to drink choices.

While the results were varied, the summary findings concluded that Democrats go for clear liquors, such as vodka and gin, while Republicans are more likely to opt for something darker, such as whiskey.

What your favorite drink says about your politics: Democratic drinkers are more likely to sip Absolut and Grey Goose vodkas, while Republican tipplers are more likely to savor Jim Beam, Canadian Club and Crown Royal, according to consumer data supplied by GFK MRI

You must be a Democrat! A new survey shows that people who are more likely to be opt for clear liquor, such as vodka, would vote Democratically

And so you're a Republican? People who choose darker spirits, such as whiskey, are more likely to vote Republican, a new consumer data survey says

There were also a variety of bipartisan beverages, including Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, Malibu Coconut, Johnnie Walker Black and Segram's 7 Crown.

Democrats, according to the analysis, drink more champagne and sparkling wine, the traditional drink to ring in the New Year.

Researchers also looked at what likely and unlikely voters drank.

According to the data, someone who chose Kendall-Jackson or Robert Mondavi wines is highly likely to vote, and they’re likely to vote Republican.

Whereas someone who savors a Chateau Ste. Michelle Merlot, one of Washington State’s top producers, or Smoking Loon, are likely to cast ballots for Democrats.

By comparison, the least likely voters were drinking harder stuff: Don Julio tequila, Jagermeister, Smirnoff Twist and Belvedere.

The analysis tracks with both stereotypes and electoral data.

The most fervent Democratic partisans drink expensive champagne and brandy, while the GOP¿s base voters drink modestly priced wine, says a new media survey by National Media, a firm that tracks demographic and consumer data

For example, older people – those who stereotypically like to enjoy a nice glass of wine – vote far more frequently than their young counterparts, those who may be mixing Jagermeister with Red Bull.

Will Feltus and a team of researchers at the Republican firm used nearly 50,000 interviews from 2012 to 2013 to complete the analysis.

To Feltus, the data shows that while Democrats appear to drink a wider variety of booze, Republicans are drinking stronger liquor.

'We added up the size of the bubbles (on the graph) – the blue bubbles are almost twice as large as the red bubbles,' Feltus said.

However history doesn't seem to match up with the analysis.

Democrats who are least likely to turn out on election day also spend heavily on high-priced booze, including Grey Goose and Absolut vodkas, and Patron tequila, according to the graph

Democratic President Harry Truman reportedly enjoyed drinking bourbon, which is supposedly a Republican beverage.

The same can be said Democratic former President Lyndon Johnson, who enjoyed drinking a Cutty Sark scotch and soda on his ranch in Texas.

Republican former presidents, too, didn't totally stick with the analysis.

Former President Gerald Ford enjoyed a gin and tonic, while former President George H.W. Bush drank vodka martinis – both drinks on the Democratic side of the spectrum.
