West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has slapped a £20million price tag on Winston Reid — even though the defender could be available for free next summer.

Reid has been a regular in the Hammers team that has had a superb start to the season, climbing to fourth in the table.

But the centre back is yet to sign a new deal and, with his contract expiring at the end of the season, has been linked with a January move to Arsenal or Liverpool.

Reid has played a key role in helping the Hammers to fourth in the Premier League table 

However, Allardyce has revealed he has no plans to sell Reid during the upcoming transfer window — unless another club decides to splash the cash.

‘He ain’t going anywhere. He is not going anywhere unless someone bids £20m or something like that,’ said Allardyce.

‘There is obviously not a lot I can do about that.

‘If somebody flirts around with a measly offer because he is in the last year of his contract, we would make more money by keeping him and finishing where we are in the league — rather than selling him and putting our good season in jeopardy.

‘Because replacing him in January — replacing anybody in January — is a very difficult job indeed.’

Hammers manager Allardyce said it would not be worth selling Reid for a small sum in January 

Reid's contract expires in the summer, meaning he would be available to leave on a free transfer

Talks over a new deal between Hammers owners and Reid have been rumbling on since the summer.

But despite the wait Allardyce is still hopeful the 26-year-old will commit himself to the club and sign a new deal at Upton Park.

‘I just don’t pay too much attention to it now it has gone on so long,’ added Allardyce.

‘I just hope that the phone call is a yes when the chairman rings me up at some stage.

‘At the moment it is neither a positive nor a negative. It is neither a yes or a no from Reidy at the moment.’
