I brought you the Manchester United haters test a few weeks ago – you can read it HERE. Now it’s time for the ‘Wayne Rooney Test.’

What’s the first thing you think about when you hear the name Wayne Rooney?

a) How close he is to breaking scoring records with Manchester United and England

b) Any of the following - Being punched in his kitchen by Phil Bardsley, demanding a massive salary at Manchester United or barking into the camera at the 2010 World Cup and at West Ham.

If you answered b) then I’d question your passion for football.

Wayne Rooney played a key role in Manchester United's win over Tottenham on Sunday 

Rooney scored the third goal for United in their win at Old Trafford 

Liverpool can't expect any loyalty from Raheem Sterling if they are not prepared to offer him the same deal as Daniel Sturridge

Chelsea look knackered... Jose Mourinho must start putting his faith in youth or he'll blow the Premier League 

One thing I have discovered about England is that if you come from humble beginnings, but go on to improve your lot in life, the reaction of the rest of the country will be split.

As you drive by in your expensive car, some will say ‘good on him, he’s done well for himself.’

Others though will be less generous. They might say ‘Lucky sod’ or ‘he doesn’t deserve that.’

Jealousy is a terrible thing. These people will focus on anything but football.

And Rooney is a classic example. I take one look at Rooney’s career and I’m seriously impressed. I find it hard to look at it any other way.

But others concentrate on things away from the football pitch and twist them into a reason to condemn Rooney. They see a working-class kid who played football in the streets of Liverpool, who made it big because of his talent, demanded big wages, lives in a massive house and they can’t stand him for it. They can’t handle that he did something they didn’t.

They refuse to applaud someone who has made the most of his talent, realised his dreams and become very wealthy in the process.

I even had one Twitter clown so obsessed with bringing Rooney down that he told me he had a violent streak – just because he fouled someone.

So if you are a football lover, what was the big story on Sunday?

Was it Rooney leading Manchester United superbly, scoring a brilliant goal and getting three crucial points against Spurs?

Rooney was criticised by some fans for swearing into a TV camera after scoring at West Ham in 2011

Rooney is closing in on goalscoring records for both Manchester Untied and England

Or was it Rooney messing around in his own home with a mate and doing absolutely nothing wrong?

Rooney’s celebration said it all. It’s a joke.

I understand why it’s a story of course – it’s a great scoop.

But is it a reason to hammer Rooney? And should he be judged as a footballer because of it?

Those who can’t handle Rooney’s success need to look at themselves. Are they upset because he achieved in life while they didn’t? Or do they dribble and drool over their keyboards because they hate everything about Manchester United?

Rooney gets into every team in the world – from Man United to Munich to Madrid and Man City.

That’s my opinion, and of course, not everybody will share it. But he’s not done badly for himself in his career. He went to Manchester United and became a club legend – that’s not easy to achieve given the rich history of that great club.

Sometimes he could have conducted himself better on and off the field, but I cannot see how any of that stuff deflects from his brilliance as a footballer.

Unless you hate Man United, or you’re jealous of Rooney’s success and wealth.

I’ve got a message for Wayne, keep knocking 'em out champ!
