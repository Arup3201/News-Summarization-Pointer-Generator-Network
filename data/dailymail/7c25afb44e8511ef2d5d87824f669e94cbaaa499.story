A Dutch colleague watching Louis van Gaal’s most recent press conference on the internet found it amusingly familiar.

He recognised the facial expression that said Manchester United’s new manager was less than impressed with what he considered a challenge to his authority. Not to mention a tactic he often employs when he does not want to answer a question. He simply dismisses it as a poor one and moves on.

As Van Gaal said after being asked if Wayne Rooney’s red card had made him doubt the wisdom of selecting the combustible Englishman as his captain, it was his ‘right’ to offer no response. Which it was.

And on a weekend when Phil Mickelson demonstrated how destructive public criticism can be in a team environment, the Dutchman did himself no harm by displaying the kind of unity on which success at Old Trafford has long been built. 

If he was unhappy with Rooney for getting himself suspended for three matches in what promises to be a tough few weeks for a misfiring United side, he expressed that view in private.

For what it’s worth, Van Gaal actually missed the point when it came to that particular enquiry about Rooney. Sometimes questions need to be asked in anticipation of a wider response and the days of debate that have followed Rooney’s dismissal for kicking Stewart Downing prove the point.

Some of it has been hysterical, some of it rather surprising. Some of his fiercest critics have suddenly become his most vocal allies, pointing to the fact that three years had passed since Rooney’s last red card. True enough. 

But a red card only six games into his captaincy at United is a statistic that at least raises concern that the burden of responsibility might occasionally become too much for a player of Rooney’s volatile nature.

That does not mean that Rooney is not the right man to lead United in these challenging times, particularly at a football club where the captain has often been an extension of a combative manager. 

There was a time when the same heart appeared to beat inside Sir Alex Ferguson and Roy Keane, even if Ferguson would now deny it and Keane will no doubt do the same when his new autobiography goes on sale next week.

Van Gaal, however, brushed off questions surrounding his choice when asked on Saturday 

The relationship between Van Gaal and Rooney is similar to that of Ferguson and Roy Keane

Van Gaal clearly sees something of himself in Rooney. It will be why he chose him. And while Rooney’s professional relationship with Ferguson might have ended much like Keane’s, he might see something of his former manager that he admires in Van Gaal, too.

That press conference on Saturday certainly reminded me of Ferguson, even if it lacked the sheer explosiveness of some of Fergie’s more memorable encounters with the media.

What made Ferguson so fascinating, in particular for the reporters whose job it was to see him ahead of every match, was his unpredictability.

Sometimes he was mesmerising. Other times grumpy and disinterested. He might surprise you by suddenly appearing friendly; funny even. And then there were those moments when he could descend into a blind rage with venomous, personal attacks. 

On one particular morning he concluded his answer to the last question by telling the assembled reporters to ‘go away and write’ their ‘s***e’. Those who were there still laugh about it to this day.

The Dutch journalists recall similar tales of Van Gaal, even if many of them have found him difficult to warm to over the years.

In certain cases relationships have been eroded by the tone of the confrontation. Not because he might declare a question unworthy of a response but because of the way he then goes on the attack. He might inform a reporter that their opinion lacks credibility because they have not had the benefit of attending his training sessions all week.

He might even point to the fact that they have never played the game professionally - an argument that jars with every football fan - and therefore are not entitled to doubt him. ‘He can be funny, too,’ said my Dutch colleague earlier this week. ‘But he sometimes enjoys trying to ridicule you in front of your colleagues.’

At the World Cup in Brazil last summer certain reporters felt Van Gaal was too controlling. He had an excellent tournament where it mattered most, of course, guiding his country to the semi-finals, which was all the more impressive for the fact that he was not blessed with quality in every area of the pitch.

But he limited his access to the official FIFA press conferences and that proved a frustration because those gatherings could be manipulated to silence certain journalists, essentially because the media officer decides who gets the microphone you require to ask a question. 

There were senior writers who were left deeply frustrated by the lack of opportunities to engage with their national team coach, particularly when the same reporter from a Dutch children’s TV show was invited to ask the final question every time.

So far here in Manchester there have been few such complaints. Reporters would probably consider Van Gaal’s press conferences a bit too brief. But for the most part he has been candid and accommodating, and if there have been flashes of that arrogance, aloofness and aggression it is only to be expected.

These, after all, are characteristics a manager probably needs to lead a club like United, and were certainly employed to good effect when he followed that astonishing 5-3 defeat at Leicester by tearing into his players in the dressing room.

As the faces Van Gaal encounters in his press conferences become more familiar, and he develops a greater command of English, there is sure to be more confrontation in that arena too.

According to my Dutch colleagues, Saturday was fairly tame by Van Gaal’s standards. With some relish they often recall a clash he had with a Dutch reporter during his time at Barcelona when he objected to a question about Rivaldo. ‘You’re very bad,’ said a ranting Van Gaal. ‘Very, very bad. No, no, no, you’re very bad. Very bad! Always negative. Never positive. Always negative.’

Give him time, and a few decent results, and there will be plenty more echoes of Ferguson.
