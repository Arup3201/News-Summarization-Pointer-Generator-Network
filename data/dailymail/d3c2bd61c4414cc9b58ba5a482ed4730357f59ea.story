Insensitive: Fox presenter Andrea Tantaros compared living on food stamps to a weight-loss plan

As record numbers of Americans spend Thanksgiving on food stamps, one Fox news presenter has offered some advice - treat the experience as a great way to lose those extra pounds.

TV host Andrea Tantaros compared food stamps - which provide an average monthly budget of $133 - to being on a diet.

Ms Tantaros was asked by co-host Stuart Varney, during Wednesday's broadcast of The Five on Fox Business, if she could live on that amount.

She told Fox viewers: 'I should try it because do you know how fabulous I’d look?

'I’d be so skinny. I mean, the camera adds ten pounds, it really does.'

Social media lit up with thousands of outraged responses following Ms Tantaros' off-hand remarks.

One tweet from @imthepain29 read: 'She can lose lbs but she can't lose Ugly.'

Another tweeted at the presenter said: 'Lucky you can diet by choice, not poverty.'

Ms Tantaros hit back on Twitter, posting: 'It's amazing how stupid & humorless some liberals can be. I'm asked if I can live on $134/mo in food WHICH I HAVE, and they go crazy Really?' 

She later highlighted a Department of Agriculture radio advert that had compared food stamps to a healthy eating plan.

The
 33-year-old later added: 'Food stamps were sold as a fitness plan to 
"look great" by our liberal, dense government - remember?

The Fox panel discussion was sparked by Newark Mayor Cory Booker's decision to live for a week on food stamps from December 4.

His plan is to highlight the struggles families face on the government-assisted program.

The Democratic politician took up the 
challenge after getting into a dispute with a voter who had argued that 
it is not the place of government to insure that everyone maintains high
 nutritional standards.

Mr Booker responded that it is when it comes to children who need to be 'ready 2 learn' at school.

The argument took a turn when the Twitter user made a slight about food stamp recipients, saying: 'why is there a family today that is "too poor to afford breakfast"? are they not already receiving food stamps?'

Booker responded: 'Lets you and I try to
 live on food stamps in New Jersey (high cost of living) and feed a 
family for a week or month. U game?'

According to a report released this week by nonprofit government watchdog The Sunlight Foundation, more Americans than ever before will be forced to use food stamps to provide their Thanksgiving dinner.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 50.1million Americans lived in 'food insecure' households in 2011 - including 16.7 million children. 

Ms Tantaros' diet remarks come in the same week that another face of Fox News, anchor Brian Kilmeade, joked that the network finds female hosts by flipping through Victoria's Secret catalogs.
