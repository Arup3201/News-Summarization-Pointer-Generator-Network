Glassy-eyed and bare-chested as he clutches a drink in a nightclub, England cricketer Gary Ballance looks as though he is celebrating a fantastic victory.

But the photograph was taken just hours after England had failed to defeat India on Sunday, leaving  followers of the national team lamenting a string of nine successive Test matches without victory – the  longest run for more than 20 years.

The 24-year-old batsman was later  carried out of the bar in Nottingham after telling incredulous fans: ‘I’m not a cricketer tonight. I’m just a  drunken b*****d.’

The Harrow-educated sports star later shouted that he was ‘absolutely f***ed’.

His drunken antics emerged after  photographs surfaced of England  footballers larking about with champagne and cigars after their failure to win a game in the World Cup finals in Brazil.

Goalkeeper Joe Hart was pictured apparently spitting drink into the mouth of Arsenal’s midfield star Jack Wilshere who was also seen smoking a cigarette and cigar in a Las Vegas pool.

With pundits and fans still discussing how far England have fallen – and why – in both football and cricket, it seems that some of our top players are rather less concerned. Ballance – who had a fine innings in the game, scoring 71 runs  – was joined in Nottingham’s  Pandora’s Box club on Sunday after close of play at Trent Bridge by teammates Joe Root, Jimmy Anderson and Liam Plunkett.

Off the field antics: Other people inside the club said they heard the Yorkshire player shouting: 'I'm not a cricketer tonight, I'm just a drunken b*****d'

On the pitch: Ballance scored 71 in the first innings of the match at Trent Bridge which ended in a draw 

It was reported that Ballance bought 
large vodkas for a group of girls and tipped the bar staff £20 – and put
 on a drunken dancing display for punters who watched him knocking back 
drinks until closing time.

‘They had to carry him out at the end of the night,’ said one witness. ‘He was standing outside with his top off screaming “England! England! England!’’’

His behaviour was all the more surprising because England have to start another five-day Test match against India this morning.

The players had been given permission to go out on Sunday night ahead of a rest day on Monday.

But his boisterous ‘re-fuelling’ will have angered many cricket fans who are desperately hoping that England can end their winless streak when the Second Test starts at Lord’s today.

Senior figures in the England and Wales Cricket Board will also be unimpressed, as they do not need yet another headache. Bowler Anderson is facing a ban from Test cricket after being charged by cricket chiefs with pushing India player Ravindra Jadeja.

Last night England team coach Peter Moores appeared to be taking a lenient approach to Ballance – at least in public.

No repercussions: The ECB, cricket's governing body, issued a statement saying they were aware Ballance had been out drinking, but said he would not face any disciplinary action because he hadn't broken any curfews

England's finest: The pictures of the cricketer emerged just days after footballer Jack Wilshire was caught smoking in a Las Vegas swimming pool. He went on holiday with friends after a dismal World Cup performance

Mouth-to-mouth: He was also seen messing with goalkeeper Joe Hart, surrounded by bikini-clad women

Venue: Witnesses said Ballance had to be carried from Pandora's Box in Nottingham at the end of the night

He said: ‘As the players had been released at the end of the first Test and were not due to meet up to begin preparations for the second Test until  Monday evening, and there were no suggestions of impropriety, there is no need for any disciplinary action.

I will however be reminding all players of their responsibilities to uphold the best possible image for England cricket.’

Moores’ apparent leniency follows that of team captain Alastair Cook who last month defended players Joe Root and Sam Robson after they were spotted stumbling out of a London nightclub.  ‘That’s just an age thing,’ said Cook.

‘Having a night out with a few of the boys is fine.’

As the England management team were looking after the public fall-out from the episode, there was no comment from Ballance last night.
