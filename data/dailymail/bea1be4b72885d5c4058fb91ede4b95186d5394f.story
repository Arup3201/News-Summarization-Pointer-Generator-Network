President Barack Obama praised the sportsmanship of the San Antonio Spurs as 'a great metaphor for what America should be all about' when the NBA champions visited the White House.

Obama hosted the Spurs on Monday in the nation's capital to celebrate their victory in the 2014 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat.

The President says the Spurs have become the United Nations of basketball teams due to the team's diversity and number of international players on their roster.

Obama also singled the team out for hiring WNBA star Becky Hammon as a coach last year. Hammon became the first full-time, paid female assistant on an NBA coaching staff.

Obama praised the Spurs for their public service efforts on literacy and community development in San Antonio.

The Spurs defeated the Miami Heat 4-1 in the 2014 NBA Finals to win the fifth championship in their history, all of which have been overseen by current head coach Gregg Popovich.

Popovich previously guided San Antonio to NBA success in 1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007 and is a three-time coach of the year.
