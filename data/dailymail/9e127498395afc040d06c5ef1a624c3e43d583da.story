First place: The John Lewis campaign was voted this year's favourite Christmas advert

It drew 1,000 complaints that it was sexist for showing a busy mother doing most of the preparations.

Although a few Scrooges moan about the wall to wall adverts selling everything from mince pies to the latest must have gadgets, eight out of ten families actually look forward to this seasons offerings by the big retailers.

Up to 15 per cent actually sat down as a family to watch the first screening and as a sign of the times a further seven per cent go online to watch the advert as it is released.

Parenting site Netmums set out to find out what made the perfect Christmas commercial and found it should contain heaps of humour, lots of children, a snapshots of special moments, feature well known songs, and use real mums, not actors.

But a celebrity backed campaign was not important with only four per cent saying it contributed to the occasion.

With retailers spending millions on their Christmas advertising campaign it is important to get the message right as a quarter get gift ideas from the festive ads while one in five change where they buy their Christmas presents according to their favourite ad.

And adverts that show off festive foods persuades a third of mums where to shop while a fifth may be swayed by the advert.

Parenting site Netmums reveals 83 per cent of families say they look forward to big-name firms screening their seasonal ads - with over half (55 per cent) claiming they get the whole family into the Christmas spirit.

Of the 1,200 mums quizzed John Lewis came top followed by Asda, M&S, Morrison's and Aldi.

Despite the Asda advert row, fewer than one in ten mums polled said the ads were 'sexist', with three in five claiming the ads reflected real life where mothers 'do most of the Christmas preparation'.

But one in ten admitted the extravagant ads made them feel pressured into buying goods they can't afford.

Overall just one in five families significantly change their buying behaviour at Christmas, with a tenth choosing 'posher shops' to make a good impression on guests, while a further tenth traded down to discount chains in order to stretch squeezed budgets further.

Netmums' Siobhan Freegard said: 'For millions of families, the first screening of Xmas ads now marks the start of the Christmas countdown. Families love the festive feeling the ads create.

'The annual battle of the ads is getting bigger each year and becoming a national event. Although John Lewis is the winner again this year, the competition are closing in with popular efforts from smaller stores including Aldi - which proves it isn't about budget but about how it makes mums and families feel inside.

'Mums also said they enjoyed the Asda and Morrisons ads showing they understand the dynamics of family life and how most families really run behind closed doors!

Controversial: Meanwhile, Asda's offering has drawn more than 1,000 complaints saying it is sexist because the mother does most of the preparations

'A retailer who gets their festive ad right will ensure families warm to them and spend with them long after the festive decorations have been taken down.'

Britain's biggest retailer Tesco remains the most popular place for families to do their main Xmas shop, used by 35 per cent of families quizzed, followed by 31 per cent who will shop at Asda, 2 per cent at Sainsbury's and 14 per cent at Morrisons.

But as families cut back costs, this year 12 per cent plan to do their main shop at Aldi or Lidl, ahead of the 7 per cent who will take to the aisles at M&S and 2.5 per cent at Waitrose.
