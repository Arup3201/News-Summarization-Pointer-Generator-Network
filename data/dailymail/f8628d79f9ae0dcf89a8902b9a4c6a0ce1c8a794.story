Venus Williams gave herself a boost ahead of the Australian Open by winning the ASB Classic — while sister Serena slumped to defeat.

Venus, 34, beat Caroline Wozniacki 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in Auckland — her first win since February. The seven-time grand slam winner said: ‘Caroline is just so fit and I know that I need to up my levels.’

Serena lost 6-4, 6-7, 6-1 to Agniesza Radwanska as Poland beat the USA to win the Hopman Cup in Perth.
