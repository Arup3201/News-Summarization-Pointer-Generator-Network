Dakota Johnson got the job: She is to play Anastasia Steele in the film adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey

For most actresses, their next major role happens after a screen test in a Hollywood studio.

For Dakota Johnson, it was all about what happened in a Los Angeles hotel room with a hunky British male star.

The daughter of Hollywood royalty was there to try to win the role of protagonist Anastasia Steele in the film adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey. 

She was auditioning with Charlie Hunnam, 33, an actor better known for action roles, who had won the part of Ana’s love interest Christian Grey, a handsome young billionaire who whips women in his Red Room of Pain. 

According to reports Universal Studios had already filmed the 6ft 1in Hunnam with a series of young actresses, talking, kissing and according to one executive, ‘squeezing’ them. 

All the candidates were judged too passive.

But Miss Johnson left the Los Angeles hotel room ten days ago with flying colours and appears to have passed what was demurely described as a ‘chemistry test’ set by Fifty Shades author EL James who was given a veto on all casting choices. 

What took place between Johnson and Hunnam in the hotel room remains a mystery, but British director Sam Taylor-Johnson is said to have pushed them to their limits ‘in every sense’. 

According to reports James had insisted the two actors should not only bring her characters to life  but should kindle the mutual passion that has helped to sell 70m copies of the Fifty Shades books worldwide.

Miss James insists her trilogy is more about romance that the sadomasochistic antics of the protagonists which the books are now associated with.

In recent months the roles of Ana and Christian have become the most sought-after in Hollywood and the $60m film is forecast to be the next year’s biggest adult film and act as a springboard to the A-List for its stars. 

However it has emerged that Miss Johnson’s family are said to be concerned that she is the only American in what is a very British affair – the director, writer and scriptwriter are all from London.

When James announced the cast on Twitter last Monday it provoked fury. More than 50,000 people supported a petition demanding that both actors be sacked. 

Johnson was mocked as too edgy, bland, too fat, too thin and a ‘scavenger’ building a career on her family name. 

Her father is Don Johnson and mother is Melanie Griffiths who are both successful Hollywood stars.  

Miss Johnson, 23, is also a model and appeared in Facebook film The Social Network. She has said: ‘I’d watch my parents at work and say, yeah, this is what I want to do. 

‘Maybe it is all I can do. I want to make people laugh and cry. And make my family happy. I know people will say that I have got it easy because of my family, but I have to prove myself every day. I am not going to go all Hollywood. I know what that is like.’

Hunnam, 33, from Newcastle, is known for shedding his clothes in controversial Channel 4 drama Queer as Folk. He was in sci-fi film Pacific Rim and also appeared on BBC children’s series Byker Grove.

The Fifty Shades trilogy has made Miss James one of the world’s richest writer, with more than £60million according to Forbes.
