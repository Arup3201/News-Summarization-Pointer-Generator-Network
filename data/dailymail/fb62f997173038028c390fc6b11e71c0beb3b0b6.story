Legal battle: Adriana Ferreyr, who is suing billionaire George Soros, is herself being sued for falsely accusing a man of rape

The former lover of billionaire George Soros, who is suing the mogul for not buying her an apartment, will be named in a lawsuit for falsely accusing a man of rape.

Actress Adriana Ferreyr, 31, filed a $50million lawsuit against the 82-year-old mogul in August 2011 after he allegedly broke a promise to buy her a $1.9m home, and is now to be sued herself.

The $5million lawsuit alleges Ms Ferreyr falsely accused a fellow Columbia University student of raping her in her New York home on New Year’s Eve.

Kyle Dubensky claims he had consensual sex with Ms Ferreyr in her apartment in Harlem on December 31, 2012.

When the drama student attempted to leave,
Ferreyr allegedly blocked the exit and physically apprehended him, drawing blood 
when digging her nails into his arm.

Dubensky
 supposedly fled and was chased into an elevator by a naked Ms Ferreyr, who started
 to strangle him, a source told the New York Post.

When
 the pair arrived at the ground floor, Ms Ferreyr, also a student at 
Columbia, told a University guard she had been sexually assaulted, after
 which police was called to the scene.

Mr Dubensky was arrested and held for 18 hours, but the District Attorney’s Office did not press charges against him.

A
 source close to Ms Ferreyr told the Post that Mr Dubensky had tried to have 
unprotected sex with her and that he also ‘strangled and tried to hit 
her' as she pursued him after the attack.

According
 to the source, Ms Ferreyr ‘blacked out’ when police arrived, but asked 
the prosecutor to release Mr Dubensky when she regained consciousness in
 hospital.

Mr Dubensky’s attorney rubbished these claims, brushing them off as ‘fiction’.

‘This is not a case of "he said, she said",’ Mr Dubensky’s attorney Michael J. Roberts told the New York Post.

‘The
 District Attorney was presented with the case and refused to file a 
complaint. In addition, Columbia University declined to pursue the case 
and saw no reason to investigate further.

More suits: Adriana Ferreyr filed a $50million lawsuit against her former boyfriend, 82-year-old billionaire George Soros, in August 2011 after he allegedly broke a promise to buy her a $1.9m home

Representatives from Ms Ferreyr’s legal team have declined to comment.

Ms Ferryr, a former child actress and star of a Brazilian soap opera had a five-year-relationship with George Soros, a 
financier known as the Man Who Broke the Bank of England after making 
millions during the 1992 UK currency crisis.

Despite
 their 53-year age gap, the pair dated for five years before the alleged assault in 2010 during an argument about an apartment he had 'promised' to buy her in Manhattan.

Last week it was reported that Ms Ferreyr is also facing legal action from Mr Soros.

The Hungarian born magnate is countersuing the aspiring actress for defamation and assault after she accused him of torture, harassment and abuse.

Headache: Mr Soros has denied that he physically abused Miss Ferreyr and promised to buy her an apartment

She alleged that the elderly billionaire assaulted her with a lamp after he told her he had given the $1.9million apartment to her love rival - his now-fiancée Tamiko Bolton.

Mr Soros’ lawyers filed their response to her lawsuit, claiming that she assaulted him with the glass lamp.

Soros’ lawyer William Zabel told the 
Post: 'This is the first time that we have had an opportunity to respond
 formally to Ms Ferreyr’s false claims and to make our own counterclaims
 to hold her accountable for the harm her malicious assertions have 
caused Mr Soros.'

Mr Soros is twice divorced, with five 
children. Although he is now engaged to Ms Bolton, his reported girlfriends have 
included the violinist Jennifer Chun and former Miss Russia Anna Malova.
