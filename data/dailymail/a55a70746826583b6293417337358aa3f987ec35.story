It may be mired in controversy, but the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is being gleefully welcomed by at least one group in Britain – musicians.

They are being offered bumper tax-free salaries of up to £66,000 to train Qatari military bandsmen to perform in front of a global TV audience during the event.

The oil-rich kingdom has already signed up 60 professional musicians from Britain – who will jet to the Gulf next month – and is seeking more.

The 2022 World Cup has been racked by controversy, with allegations of corruption surrounding the decision to award the tournament to Qatar and widespread concern that the kingdom’s extreme summer heat will ruin matches and be dangerous for players

The first wave of recruits, who also get free accommodation, includes violinists, and woodwind, brass and percussion players. There are also former military pipers and drummers, and at least three orchestral conductors.

They will be expected to stay in Qatar for up to three years, by which time it is hoped the Qatari bandsmen will have reached the required standard to play at the opening ceremony and other high-profile events during the tournament.
