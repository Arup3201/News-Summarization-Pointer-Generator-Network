A fisherman got the shock of his life after accidentally catching a massive shark just 100 yards off the British coast.

Skipper Chris Glaves and his crew were fishing for seabass when they hauled in the 320-pound thresher shark just north of Padstow, Cornwall.

Luckily for the crew of the Good Intent the thresher was already dead when it was brought onboard. At 15 feet from its nose to the tip of its trailing tail, it could have decapitated a man with just a single swish.

The shark - a relative of the Great White - was lurking thousands of miles from its usual home in the seas around Asia and North America.

But it drew a huge crowd when it was brought into Newquay Harbour and then again when it was sold at Plymouth Fish Market.

Chris said: 'There was nothing that could have been done to rescue it. A shark needs oxygen to breath and it got wrapped up in the net which was too tight for it.

'If the shark was alive when it came up we would have freed it. As it was dead the shark was taken to the fish market to be sold.'

Sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills, meaning they have to keep moving to respire.

Threshers use their long scythe-like tails, which can make up around half of their total length, to stun prey before they tear at the flesh.

Thresher sharks are usually found 
along the continental shelves of North America and Asia in the North 
Pacific, but exist in all oceans of the world.

They tend to stay in the open ocean, but do not venture below 500m, preferring to feed on schools of fish at shallower depths.

The thresher shark has a torpedo-shaped body and small head and teeth.

It is named after its long 
scythe-like tail, which is used to stun prey before the shark goes in for the kill.

The breed is considered a 'vulnerable' species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

The predator is the third of its kind to have been caught in Cornwall in the last few months.

Angler Malcolm Roberts, 49, was fishing with friends off the coast of Looe when a 350-pound thresher tugged on his line.

It took them an hour and a half to haul in the 13-foot shark.

And in July a 20-foot thresher was caught off Falmouth by the trawler The John Boy, which was fishing for mackerel in the English Channel.

One of the fish was also photographed recently as it jumped spectacularly out of the sea off the Welsh coast.
