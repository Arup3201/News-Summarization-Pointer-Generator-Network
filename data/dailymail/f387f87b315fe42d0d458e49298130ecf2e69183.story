Devoted parents Zara Phillips MBE and Mike Tindall are pulling out all the stops for their daughter's first birthday.

Mia Grace Tindall, the youngest member of the royal family who is 16th in line to the throne, turns one on Saturday.

And her father Mike, 36, who is currently in training for an appearance on Channel 4 reality show The Jump, is taking a break from filming in Austria to fly home for the occasion.

Zara spoke about Mia's birthday at an event in Australia last week: '[I've] got to go home first and then see what happens.'

Meanwhile Zara, 33, who has been in Australia for the past few weeks, said at an event that she'd soon figure out the plan for Mia's special day just as soon as she gets back.

Speaking with Daily Mail Australia at the Magic Millions Race Day on Saturday, Zara said: '[I've] got to go home first and then see what happens.'

Olympic silver-medal winner Zara shared that she couldn't be more thrilled about the past 12 months of motherhood.

'It's gone so quickly,' she said.

Mother-of-one Zara said that little Mia loves playing with fellow royal youngsters Prince George and her cousins Savannah and Isla.

'We've all got small ones now,' she said. 'So it's great fun.'

Zara has become known for her no-nonsense, multitasking mothering style; and is almost always seen taking her daughter with her wherever she goes.

Zara, who is set to return to Australia every year until 2018, said: 'It's going to be great to come back down every year and get a bit of sunshine.'

A well-respected  eventer, Zara has built up a successful racing business and has even trained racehorses for her mother, the Princess Royal. 

As a result, Mia has become a regular sight on the racecourse, although her father Mike Tindall seems to prefer spending his Sundays at home.

First-time father Mike is clearly enjoying being a parent to his 'very chilled' baby. According to the rugby player, Mia, who does not have a nanny, spends much of her time travelling with her mother.

'She stays in the truck [horsebox] with her,' said Tindall, who was speaking to the Times newspaper.

'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. You are going to travel around a lot.

Despite both parents' sporting success, Tindall says he doesn't expect his daughter to go on to a rugby or eventing career of her own but says the couple already have three Shetland ponies waiting for her.

'Ideally, I don't think we would have her on a horse or a rugby pitch but she might make her own decision and then you have just got to support it.

'I don't think we'll ever keep her away from horses. We've got three Shetland ponies waiting for her.

'If it's death-defying feats she wants to do, you have to get your head round it and support her, and if she wants to study and be a nuclear physicist, you do that as well.'

But with a mother aiming for gold at Rio 2015 and a father who is about to risk life and limb attempting ski jumps on a reality TV show, the former probably awaits for little Mia.

Zara gave birth to Mia on January 17 2014. The baby weighed 7lb 12oz girl, and is the Queen's fourth great-grandchild.

Father Mike took to Twitter after the birth to describe his joy at becoming a father for the first time, saying it was 'definitely the best day of my life'.

A few days later, Mike also announced Mia's name on the social networking site. 

The couple had predicted they would take some time to come up with a name because they had chosen not to be told the sex of their child in advance.

Zara, who is one of Britain's leading equestrian riders, gave birth to her first child at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital with her husband at her side.

She is the daughter of Princess Anne, but does not hold a royal title after her mother decided not to pass on her status to her children.

Mia Grace does not hold any royal or aristocratic title.

When Zara herself was born, her name was likewise a break from tradition as it had no precedent in the royal family. 

Zara and Tindall first met in a Sydney bar when he was in Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. They married in July 2011 in Edinburgh at a ceremony attended by the Queen and senior royals. They moved back to Anne's Gatcombe Park estate last January after selling their regency home in Cheltenham.
