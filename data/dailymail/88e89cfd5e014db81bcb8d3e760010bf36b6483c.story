Doctors are investigating whether statins cause side-effects or not

A leading medical journal overstated the dangers of  taking statins by up to 20 times, it was claimed last night.

The British Medical Journal has  now withdrawn statements published last year that said the cholesterol-lowering drugs cause side effects in one in five patients, but has not retracted the articles.

A leading statins researcher, who says the figure is one in 100, called the claims a ‘huge error’ that will ‘cause unnecessary deaths’.

It is feared the BMJ articles could discourage patients from taking the life-saving medicines, which are prescribed to millions in the UK.

The journal yesterday blamed internal and external reviewers for failing to pick up the mistakes and pledged an independent investigation to determine whether the articles should be retracted completely.

Professor Sir Rory Collins said the BMJ articles overstated the risks of taking statins by 20 times. Sir Rory, who has led analysis of many statin trials, said side effects affect less than 1 per cent of patients – compared to the 18 to 20 per cent figure quoted by  the BMJ.

And the professor, whose work at the Clinical Trials Research Unit in Oxford has been sponsored by drugs companies as well as academic bodies and charities, called for the BMJ to issue a full apology and retraction of the articles.

Sir Rory said: ‘The authors of these two papers misrepresented the evidence repeatedly, even after their errors had been pointed out to them.

‘Such misconduct should be dealt with appropriately by retracting these seriously flawed papers in the interest of public health.

'If people at elevated risk stop taking their statins – or don’t start taking their statins – they will have unnecessary heart attacks and strokes. There will be unnecessary deaths from vascular causes. This is a serious disservice to medicine.’

About eight  million in the UK at risk of heart disease are prescribed statins, many of whom will be confused by conflicting claims about side effects in recent months.

In October, a BMJ article by John Abramson and colleagues questioned the decision to extend statins to thousands at low risk of heart attacks and strokes, saying the drugs had not been proven to save lives in that group.

Side effects of statins are said to include muscle pain and memory problems - but academics disagree in their findings

They said an observational study had shown that between 18 per cent and 20 per cent of statin users suffer side effects such as liver disease and kidney problems and this figure was repeated in a BMJ commentary by a cardiologist.

The UK is the top prescriber of statins in Europe, and second only to Australia in the developed world.

More than a million prescriptions for the cholesterol-busting drugs are written each week in England, compared with a few thousand in 1981.

Doctors used to prescribe statins only to patients with a 30 per cent risk of a heart attack within the next decade, but this was cut to a 20 per cent risk in 2005. Under guidance being proposed, the threshold would be lowered to 10 per cent.

Oxford University researchers looking at 27 statin trials involving 175,000 people, some of whom were at low risk of heart problems, found the drugs cut the risk of heart attacks, strokes and operations to unblock arteries by a third or more.

The benefits were gained no matter what level of cholesterol patients started out with. Healthier people who were given statins also had lower overall death rates than those given a placebo. It concluded the positives greatly exceeded any side effects from taking the drugs.

The most serious reaction is myopathy in about one in 1,000 users, resulting in muscle pain, tenderness and weakness. This condition can progress to rhabdomyolysis – a breakdown of muscle cells that can lead to kidney failure and death.

Both authors have now withdrawn that statement.

The journal’s editor-in-chief Dr Fiona Godlee said she was withdrawing some of the statements made in the articles.

This was ‘so that patients who could benefit from statins are not wrongly deterred from starting or continuing treatment because of exaggerated concerns over side effects’.

The decision on whether to retract the entire article – and all of the claims made in it – has been passed to an independent panel, she added.

Medical experts have long debated whether the use of statins should be extended to people with a low risk of heart disease. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said it welcomed the BMJ’s move. He said: ‘Statins are an important weapon in the fight against heart disease and it is essential that trusted medical journals like the BMJ do not mislead the public.

‘Patients should feel reassured by this move and should not stop taking their statin.’

But Professor Kevin Channer, consultant cardiologist at Claremont Hospital, Sheffield, this month told the Daily Mail he would not take a statin unless absolutely necessary,

‘Whenever you’re taking a drug, you’ve got to think about the risks and the benefits,’ he said. ‘Statins reduce your chance of heart attack or stroke by about 30 per cent, so, yes, there’s a benefit. But in real terms, it’s very small.

‘My annual risk of a stroke or heart attack is about 1 per cent – very low. Taking a statin would take it down to 0.7 per cent – still very low.  I’ve spent my professional life prescribing statins, so I know about the side effects: muscle aches, debility and stomach upsets.’
