Brendan Rodgers has hit out at England’s treatment of Daniel Sturridge, blaming them for the Liverpool striker’s thigh injury.

Sturridge was injured last Friday in a training session he had asked to sit out, less than 48 hours after playing 89 minutes of England’s 1-0 friendly win over Norway.

That meant he missed Monday’s 2-0 win over Switzerland in a Euro 2016 qualifier and is now out for a further three weeks. Rodgers is furious his star striker was not given more rest.

‘We’re disappointed because we feel it’s an injury which could have been prevented,’ the Anfield boss told TalkSport.

‘Clubs work differently to international teams. It’s the recovery strategy. When we look at our players here, we look at them individually, in terms of what their needs are.’ Had Sturridge been involved in a Liverpool game rather than an England match last Wednesday, he would have only been required to do light running and stretching on what is regarded as the ‘second recovery day’.

However, with England facing a crucial trip to Switzerland, it is believed boss Roy Hodgson wanted to maximise his time with the players and involved Sturridge in the session despite the 25-year-old expressing concerns.

Daniel Sturridge could be out for up to two weeks but should return for the Merseyside derby

‘Some players are very fast, they will have a second day, active recovery, whereas other players can work on that second day,’ added Rodgers. ‘When you’re a type of player like Raheem Sterling or Daniel Sturridge, you need to recover them differently.

‘From what I’ve seen, Sturridge sprinted with the ball for nearly 50 yards to shoot and that’s when he pulls up. That’s where the issues are.’

Liverpool could be without Sturridge for fixtures including the Merseyside derby on September 27 and the Champions League game in Basle on October 1.

Rodgers added: ‘The players go (away on international duty) and tell the associations how they work. Of course, it’s always up to the manager. 

‘And on that second day for us, the sessions are only low to moderate intensity in small spaces, or you get injuries. If you ask most players, the second day is when they really feel it, although some are different. Roy has probably been led by (England’s) sports science department.

‘But you can’t throw a blanket over all the players. One recovery programme doesn’t fit them all. Luis Suarez needed to do extra work on his second day of recovery. It is about maximising availability.’

The international break has severely hit Liverpool, with Emre Can suffering an ankle twist during Germany’s Under 21 win over Romania that will keep him out for up to six weeks, while Joe Allen jarred a knee during Wales’s 2-1 win over Andorra.

The FA must compensate Liverpool up to £200,000 — three weeks’ of Sturridge’s wages. They are aware of Liverpool’s concerns and have discussed the matter with the club.
