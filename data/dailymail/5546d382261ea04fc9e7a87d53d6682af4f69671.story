Milky Pin-Ups is a photo series of old-fashioned, 50s-style glamour girls - dressed entirely in dairy produce.

The incredible fluid shots are the work of photographer Jaroslav Wieczorkiewicz, who specialises in working with liquid.

Unbelievably they are not created 
using any tricks or computer imagery - each girl is actually covered in 
pints and pints of milk to create the shots.

Dream Girl: Milk pin ups, created by Jaroslav Wieczorkiewicz, in which dairy produce is used to create the 'dresses'

The photos are based on the pin ups popular in the 1950's and have a fun flirty feel to them

Each picture is the result of numerous different shots layered together

‘We work with specific light and pretty normal cameras,’ Jaroslav explains, ‘there is no magic behind it.’

The rather messy shoots see a model, clad only in bikini bottoms, having a jug of milk poured over parts of her body by an assistant as Jaroslav captures the movement of the liquid using fast exposure. 

Each photograph takes about 200 frames and the milk is poured onto different areas of the models body for each one, captured mid-flow by the camera.

These individual shots are then amalgamated using Photoshop into a single image, creating the illusion that the girl is wearing a single milk dress.

The individual frames are simply layered - but not altered or 'filled in' in any way

Jaroslav who also works with other liquids, says there is no magic behind the pictures, just hard work

With each picture requiring around 200 frames, we can only imagine the amount of mess left after a shoot

The series of photographs is soon to become a calendar

The individual frames are simply layered in Photoshop and not altered or ‘filled in’ in any way.

‘It’s tiring work but worth it, I want to stay true to the process,’ Jaroslav tells Mail Online.

Originally from Poland, Jaroslav is now based in London and has founded the AurumLight Studio, which specialises in conceptual photography, limited calendars and advertising.

His use of unusual effects in his photography has seen him begin to tour the world offering seminars on the techniques he uses to achieve his amazing photographs.
