Quack: Kimberly Smedley, 45, faces five years in prison after illegally injecting woman across the U.S. with dangerous silicone

An unlicensed cosmetic surgeon has pleaded guilty to conspiracy after she traveled across the U.S. injecting industrial silicone into the buttocks of female customers.

Kimberly Smedley, 45, faces up to five years in prison for operating her illegal practice out of hotel rooms in Baltimore, Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and New York.

She kept the silicone in a water jug for the procedures - and used 'super glue with cotton balls to prevent silicone leaking out' of the women's flesh.

She charged '$500 and $1,600, always in cash, for 
each session where she typically injected silicone in nine places on each 
side of the buttocks', according to court papers.

Smedley, from Atlanta, Georgia, told clients that the silicone was medical grade. However it was actually intended for metal or plastic lubrication, as an additive for paint and coatings, and furniture or automotive polishes, according to Baltimore district court.

The therapist offered to inject the chemical 'into the buttocks of customers for larger and fuller buttocks in exchange for money' according to the smokinggun.com.  Many of her customers between 2003 and 2011 were strippers.

The 45-year-old is due to be sentenced in July and as part of a plea deal, will be fined $250,000.

She had used her earnings to fund a lavish lifestyle, driving a luxury SUV and living in an exclusive Altanta neighbourhood where homes are worth around $500,000.

Smedley was investigated last year after one woman fell seriously ill from receiving silicone injections. She was arrested at a hotel in Washington D.C. as she was preparing to see customers for  treatments.

In 2008, during an investigation by the New York Post, Smedley told a reporter: 'I can't tell you if you'll have scars or not. You have to know your 
own body. You need to be sure of what you're doing. I'm not promising 
anything.'

Makeshift practice: Smedley reportedly saw clients in hotel rooms across the U.S. to administer injections including this one in downtown Washington D.C.

Illegal silicone injections, often used by sex workers and those in the transgender community to alter their appearance, are incredibly dangerous and even life-threatening.

Dr M.R. Khalifeh, a registered plastic surgeon, told Fox: 'We see long-term effects six months to a year later...the silicone can bubble to the surface and cause chronic infections. It is really difficult to treat.'

Smedley's actions came to light after another practitioner of illegal silicone buttock injections was jailed earlier this month.  

Padge-Victoria Windslowe, a transgender 
hip-hop singer who calls herself 'Black Madam', faced charges in connection with the
killing of a woman who died after a botched bottom implant.

Windslowe, 42, was about to host a 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, where women receive black market implants, when she was apprehended.

An unidentified 23-year-old woman, reportedly an 
exotic dancer, was treated for a blocked artery in the lung and spent 
seven days in hospital. She later died of complications caused by 
an illegal implant allegedly made by Windslowe.

In another gruesome case in Miami, Florida, a transgendered woman Oneal
Ron Morris, 30, was arrested after a patient complained the bogus doctor 
pumped tyre sealant into her buttocks.

Some 30 people across the U.S. have come forward with claims they were scammed by Morris.

One alleged victim Rajee Narinesingh, accused Morris of making her 'into a 
monster' after she received several procedures from her in 
2005.

Narinesingh, a transgendered woman, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon, using medical silicone and said she had heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth through the transgender community.

After being injected with a cocktail of toxins she allegedly left with lumpen shapes in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and a ballooning upper lip. She later had to pay a real surgeon to repair the botched job.

A court was told that Morris used super glue to patch up entry wounds in the skin.

Morris has been charged with two felony counts of practising medicine without a license with serious injury. She had pleaded not guilty and was out on bond. Authorities have said more charges could be forthcoming.
