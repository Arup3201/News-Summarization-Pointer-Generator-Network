George Osborne chose Budget Day to make his Twitter debut - and was immediately deluged with abuse.

Even before unveiling his spending plans, the Chancellor was hit with insults from some of the tens of thousands of followers of his @George_Osborne account.

His innocuous Twitter debut that sparked the attack simply said: ‘Today I'll present a Budget that tackles the economy's problems head on helping those who want to work hard & get on.’

It included a link to a picture of Mr Osborne working at his desk, wearing a crumpled, open-neck shirt with the red Budget box in front.

But he was immediately hit with a barrage of abuse, including missives such as: ‘learn to punctuate correctly you risible t**t’.

Another example of taunting was: ‘You’re a first class b*****d, you overpaid, overeducated fox hunting t**t.’

But he also received more insightful criticism, including: ‘Look on the bright side, @George_Osborne: the economic tsunami of Cyprexit will drown out any future budgetary U-turns you make.’

Mr Osborne initially only followed some Cabinet members – diplomatically picking the official account of David Cameron as one of his first to follow.

He also immediately followed former Cabinet colleague Dr Liam Fox who last week called for a cut in taxes – a possible signal that he is on the road to being rehabilitated back into the government.

Other figures he followed included tycoon and philanthropist Bill Gates and right-wing historian Niall Ferguson.

He did not follow any Liberal Democrat ministers, snubbing even Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

The OBR – Office for Budget Responsibility – was also not on Mr Osborne’s Twitter list. The independent watchdog recently rebuked the PM for misrepresenting its information.

It is not the first time Mr Osborne has suffered public abuse. Thousands of sports spectators booed him when he appeared at a Paralympic medal ceremony last year.

A poll last week from Ipsos Mori showed that when a policy was attributed to Mr Osborne, it immediately became less popular even if it initially had majority support.
