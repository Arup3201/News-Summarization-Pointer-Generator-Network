Sir Richard Branson insists he still intends to travel to space with his family on Virgin Galactic, despite a test flight crash last week that killed one pilot.

Speaking from Necker Island - his private resort in the Caribbean - Branson said surviving pilot Peter Siebold, 43, escaped serious injury and should be out of hospital in the next few days.

US investigators say they have not ruled out the possibility of pilot error on board SpaceShipTwo, which crashed in the Mojave Desert in California on Friday, killing co-pilot Michael Alsbury, 39.

Branson told Sky News he still intends on travelling to space with his family on the Virgin Galactic despite the fatal crash during a test flight last week

Branson the Virgin group's founder, said Virgin Galactic could 'move forward' following the disaster as he vowed to travel on board the space flight with his relatives once safety tests have been completed.

Branson told Sky News: 'We've spent many, many years building a spacecraft, a mothership, a space port, that I think can do the job and do the job safely.

'We will not start taking people until we've finished a whole massive series of test flights and until myself and my family have gone up, and until we feel that we can safely say to people 'we're ready to go'.'

He added: 'All I can say is we will not fly members of the public unless we can fly myself and family members.

'We need to be absolutely certain our spaceship has been thoroughly tested - and that it will be - and once it's thoroughly tested and we can go to space, we will go to space.

'We must push on. There are incredible things that can happen through mankind being able to explore space properly.' 

Sir Richard insisted that 'we must push on' following the disaster that killed one pilot on Friday

Speaking on the Today show this morning, Branson insisted the team intends to continue working on the spaceship, despite what he called a 'horrible setback'.

'We have a wonderful spaceship,' he said. 'They're not going to down tools - they're going to move forward and create a spaceship company that will one day be the marvel of the world… It's worth the risks.'

He added they owed it to Alsbury to carry on with the project.

'We owe it to him to continue and that we will do,' he said. 'It's a grand program which has had a horrible setback, but I don't think anyone watching this program would want us to abandon it at this stage.' 

He would not speculate on the cause of the crash and said he will follow the National Transit Safety Board's (NTSB) lead.

Speaking to Sky News, Branson also criticised the 'irresponsible innuendo' in some of the reports of the crash, including claims there had been a mid-air explosion and that some engineers had left the project over safety concerns.

'It was incredibly hurtful to the 400 engineers who have worked so gallantly at Virgin Galactic,' he said.

'It was insulting. If the press had looked at the photographs they would have seen full fuel tanks and engines all intact on the ground and yet they were talking about a massive explosion.

'They were talking about people ejecting out of the plane and ejector seats. We don't have ejector seats.

'It was the British press at its worst and some of them should hang their heads in shame.'

Last year, Branson said he hoped to to take his children Sam (left), 29, and Holly (right), 32, into space with him aboard Virgin Galactic's first passenger spaceflight on SpaceShipTwo

Branson said there was 'overwhelming global support' for the project and he had received hundreds of supportive emails, including two people who signed up for flights on the day of the disaster.

'I'm absolutely convinced Virgin Galactic has a great future,' he added.

Last year, Branson spoke about his hopes to take his  children Sam, 29, and Holly, 32, into space with him aboard Virgin Galactic's first passenger spaceflight on SpaceShipTwo.

'I think any rational person would be slightly nervous, but it's going to be the most incredible experience ever,' Sam Branson told NBC in an interview.

'We've had people like myself who booked the whole spaceship for their families,' Richard Branson added, 'and I think you know it'll be just a magnificent experience for everybody.'

NTSB, which is leading the probe into the crash, has revealed that seconds before the crash a safety device to slow the descent of the craft had been deployed prematurely.

Investigators found that the spaceship's 'feathering' system - which lifts and rotates the tail to create drag - was activated before the craft reached the appropriate speed.

The system of deployment is a two-step process, but Christopher Hart, acting chairman of the NTSB, said that, while the co-pilot unlocked the system, the second step occurred 'without being commanded'.

'After it was unlocked, the feathers moved into the deployed position and two seconds later we saw disintegration,' he told a press conference.

Mr Hart said investigators would look at a wide range of issues including training, the spacecraft's design and whether there was pressure to continue testing, over the coming months to determine the cause of the crash.

Asked whether investigators were 'edging' towards the possibility of pilot error, Mr Hart replied: 'We're not edging towards anything. We're not ruling anything out.

'We're looking at all of these issues to determine what was the root cause of this mishap.

'We are looking at a number of possibilities including that possibility (pilot error).'

Virgin Galactic - owned by Sir Richard's Virgin Group and Aabar Investments PJS of Abu Dhabi - plans to fly passengers to altitudes more than 62 miles (100km) above Earth.

The company, which sells seats on each prospective journey for 250,000 US dollars (£156,000), has denied reports it ignored safety warnings ahead of the test flight crash.

In a statement, the company said: 'At Virgin Galactic, we are dedicated to opening the space frontier, while keeping safety as our 'North Star'. This has guided every decision we have made over the past decade, and any suggestion to the contrary is categorically untrue.'
