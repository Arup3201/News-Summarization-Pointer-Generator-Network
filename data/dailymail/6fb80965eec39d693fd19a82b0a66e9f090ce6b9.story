Battersea Bridge in London is wonky according to Apple Maps

When people get their hands on an Apple iPhone 5 tomorrow, there will be one familiar icon missing.

Google Maps is no longer on the iPhone, after Apple decided to go it alone and produce their own Maps app with some help from data providers such as TomTom.

But when it comes to the visual side of things, Apple faces a few bumps in the road for instance, Colchester seems covered under a permanent veil of cloud.

Meanwhile, certain roads - such as Battersea Bridge in London - seem a little awkward for your average motorist.

Last night the firm released the updated 
software for existing iPhones and iPads which replaced Google's Maps 
with Apple's

But it instantly faced a barrage of criticism from users who
 complained about missing towns, misplaced villages, satellite images 
covered by cloud, incorrect searches and even a farm identified as an 
airport.

As the iPhone 5 launches, along with the new iOS software, many more errors are likely to come to light over the next few weeks.

Errors noticed by users and tech reviewers include:

The Apple service is server-based, the firm said, so the data is constantly being refined and improved. Users are also encouraged to use a 'Report a Problem' feature to point out errors.

With maps being one of the most-used 
features on smartphones, Apple may find themselves in a rare situation 
of widespread customer dissatisfaction.

Apple decided to drop Google Maps from the phone in June.

The smartphone market is rapidly polarising between the iPhone and Google's Android phones, and - along with Apple filing many patent lawsuits against Android's biggest manufacturers - relationships have become strained over the last five years.

It is a far cry from when the iPhone was first announced, with Google integration sold as a key feature of the phone.

Users who are dissatisfied with Apple's map offering can only access Google Maps by using the browser-based version, which does not offer the same usability as a bespoke app.

TomTom defended the integrity of the map software, saying it provided only the data, and was not responsible for how Apple used it within the app.

A spokesman said: 'The user experience is determined by adding additional features to the map application such as visual imagery.

'User experience fully depends on the choices these manufacturers make.

'We are confident about our map quality, as selling 65 million portable navigation devices across the world and more than 1.4m TomTom apps for iPhone in the past two years reaffirms this quality.'

Apple's maps also feature 3D versions of major cities such as London.

The poor service, if it continues, is likely to also impact many businesses.

The BBC quotes a Denver-based blogger who runs a business repairing Apple goods.

He said: 'This is incredibly different from using Google Maps. 'It's a tremendous step backwards and something that cripples iOS for Apple's customers.

'I [searched] "iPhone Repair" and "iPad Repair" since that's relevant to our business. The results broke my heart.

'All of the work I've put into our local recognition is completely gone.'

Meanwhile, pilots could be misled into trying to make an emergency landing in a farm because of an error on a new Apple map tool, Justice Minister Alan Shatter said.

The minister has notified the technology giant of a mistake in his south Dublin constituency and asked for it to be urgently corrected.

Apple's new iOS 6 maps application has placed the standard airport map symbol on the spot of a 35-acre site called Airfield, in Dundrum - home to a city farm, gardens and cafe.

Sarah
 Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, said: 'Apple believes 
that they can deliver a better experience for customers 
than Google.

'But in the short term, Google has a better mapping application, and 
iPhone customers will suffer.'

However Michael 
Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc, said - despite the short-term pain - it was a wise business decision.

He said: 'It doesnâ€™t make sense for Apple to outsource a key part of their entire
 ecosystem to Google.'

'In context of Airfield there are a variety of possible alternative images that could be utilised such as a cow, a goat, a sheep, a flower or any indeed other type of plant, as Airfield operates a nursery,' Mr Shatter said.

'An aircraft is an entirely inappropriate flight of imagination.'

The error prompted Dublin Airport Authority to tweet: 'Just in case anybody is confused @DublinAirport is not moving to the southside. #mapfail.'

Mr Shatter said he accepts mistakes can be made but added that he was surprised to discover Airfield being marked as an airport.

'Clearly the designation is not only wrong but is dangerously misleading in that it could result in a pilot, unfamiliar with the area, in an emergency situation and without other available information, attempting a landing,' he said.

'I have arranged that Apple be informed of the error and requested that it be urgently corrected.'
