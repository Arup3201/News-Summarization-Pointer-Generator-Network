Mike Dean had a good game in very difficult circumstances and over the 90 minutes, to the independent eye, did nothing to add to Jose Mourinho’s claims of a campaign against his team.

Sure enough some referees would have waved away appeals for the penalty which Dean awarded against Nemanja Matic, but replays confirmed what I thought when agreeing that the midfielder had caught Sadio Mane before playing the ball.

There were some referees who would have given the home side a penalty of their own when Diego Costa was challenged by Jose Fonte.

Some officials may have waved away this penalty claim awarded to Southampton, as Nemanja Matic brings down Sadio Mane, but replays confirmed midfielder had caught the winger before getting the ball

Chelsea striker Diego Costa appeals for a penalty but is denied this time by Dean

Replays were inconclusive but pundits felt Dean was correct. Had he awarded the penalty of course Jose Fonte would have had to be dismissed.

The one decision I had to disagree with was when Matic cynically tripped his opponent and Dean, after due consideration and perhaps realising that Matic was already on a caution, decided to keep his cards in his pocket. Mourinho wisely subbed Matic shortly afterwards.

Chelsea could also point to a trip by Tadic on Branislav Ivanovic just inside the penalty area in the first half but to the naked eye at high speed it looked like a dive which Dean did well not to caution.

Branislav Ivanovic went down in the box but in real time it looked like a dive - replays showed contact from Tadic but it would have been tough to give

Costa claims he was fouled by Diego Fonte - if the penalty was given the defender would be been sent off

Jose Mourinho claims a campaign against his side but Dean's performance did nothing to support his theory
