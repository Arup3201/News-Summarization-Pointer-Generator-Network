Mortgage costs would rise in an independent Scotland, the Treasury is to warn as support for breaking away from the rest of the UK slumps again.

Fewer than a third of Scots now back Alex Salmond’s dream of independence, with less than 18 months to go before his referendum.

It comes as the Westminster government vows to step up its warnings about the threat posed to Scotland if it backs independence.

As Alex Salmond's referendum on independence draws closer, more people say they want to stay in the UK

Ahead of next year’s referendum, David Cameron and his ministers will sound the alarm about the impact on energy security, defence, welfare and pensions if Scotland goes it alone.

Announcing the coalition’s new programme of legislation yesterday, the Queen said: ‘My government will continue to make the case for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.’

The referendum is due to be held on 18 September 2014.

Policy papers from the Westminster government have already warned about legal doubts about an independent Scotland, and Scottish National Party plans to continue using the pound.

In the next fortnight the will warn that borrowing costs will rise if Scotland becomes a new state, because it will be too small to borrow on the global markets at low rates.

It would push up mortgage and insurance bills and cut the costs of pension funds, The Times reported.

The latest poll by Ipsos MORI revealed only 31 per cent of Scots think Scotland should be an independent country

The report will raise serious doubts about the ability of an independent Scotland to borrow in the financial markets, and the impact on homeowners.

A new Ipsos MORI opinion poll for The Times of 1,000 Scots shows support for Scotland leaving the UK has fallen again.

The gap between those in favour and those against has widened by seven to 28 percentage points, among those certain to vote in the referendum.

Just 31 per cent back independence, down three points since February. Meanwhile 59 per cent of Scots are opposed, up by four points. Just 10 per cent say they are undecided.
