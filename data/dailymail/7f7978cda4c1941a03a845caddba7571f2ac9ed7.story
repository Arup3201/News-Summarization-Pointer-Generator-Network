A New York man faces spending the rest of his life in prison as his manslaughter trial begins for driving into a taxi carrying a pregnant young couple to the hospital.

Julio 'Wemo' Acevedo, 46, is also charged with driving away from the scene of an accident after the crash instantly killed Nachman and Raizel Glauber in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

The BMW driver, who went on trial Monday, is thought to have been traveling at 60mph, twice the speed limit, when the incident occurred just after midnight on March 3, 2013.

Previous convictions mean Acevedo faces as long as life in prison if he is found guilty,  according to the New York Daily News. 

The Glaubers, who were married in 2012, were not wearing seat belts when the Toyota Camry they were riding in was T-boned at the intersection of Kent Ave and Wilson Street.

Doctors at Bellevue Hospital were able to deliver the 21-year-old Glauber's baby boy, but the child died the next day.

The family's Orthodox Jewish community offered a $15,000 award for information leading to the arrest of Acevedo, who left the scene.

He was eventually taken into custody four days after the accident, when he surrendered himself to police after arranging to meet them in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Acevedo has a history of felonies, including a 1987 murder conviction that was overturned in 1997 because of new evidence showing that he was under duress when he killed Kevin '50 Cent' Martin, who inspired the name of rapper Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson.

He later accepted a plea deal combining a manslaughter charge in the same case with a charge for a robbery he committed 12 days after being released. 

There are also gun and drug convictions on Acevedo's rap sheet, and he was awaiting an April court date for drunk driving when he hit the Glaubers.

The criminal told reporters after his hit-and-run arrest that his illegal speeding was because he was afraid of being shot by someone who pulled out a gun and said, 'Nothing is ever forgotten.'

The alleged incident may have been connected to his  killing of  Martin, according to the Daily Beast.

Acevedo's lawyer Scott Brettschneider is expected to say that his client fled the scene because of a distrust of authorities stemming from his wrongful murder conviction.

It is also predicted that the attorney will claim Acevedo has limited liability for the 2013 accident and that the Glaubers' cab had moved into the intersection when it had a stop sign.

The BMW driver has said that he was not going 60mph and had not been drinking before the crash.

The Glaubers' cab driver Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32 at the time, sustained minor industries but survived.

Mrs Glauber's brother Joseph Silberstein, the first witness in Monday's trial, said that he did not blame Mr Delacruz for the deaths, but rather Acevedo.

Prosecutor Tim Gough opened the trial by going through evidence linking the BMW's driver to the accident, including a bag of frozen rats in the car that had the suspect's fingerprints on it, the New York Post reported. 

The frozen rats were destined for Acevedo's pet boa constrictor.
