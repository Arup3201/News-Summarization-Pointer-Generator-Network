Crime Boss: Terry Adams, 59, arrived at the High Court, wearing a suit he designed, to answer accusations he is using criminal proceeds to fund a luxurious lifestyle 

A notorious gangster has told a judge he feels like a 'ponce' because he is living off of his wife and working for free as a 'creative' clothes designer. 

Terry Adams the founder of London's Clerkenwell Crime Syndicate, told the High Court today he was 'frustrated' by his lack of income. 

The 58-year-old, who arrived in a blue suit he had designed himself, is accused of using criminal profits to fund a luxurious lifestyle.

The crime boss, who headed the organisation nicknamed The Adams Family, said he had been treated to four meals at The Ivy and three trips to The Royal Opera House.

But he claims he can not afford the £750,000 confiscation order that was imposed alongside his sentence for money laundering in 2007, suggesting that his wife Ruth his is only source of income.

He is now trying to have all of his debts - £600,000 worth - eradicated on the grounds of 'poverty'.  

Adams's court appearance today came after his conviction for breaching a financial reporting order which began when he was jailed seven years ago.

It required him to report all spending over £500 to the Serious Organised Crime Agency over the next 10 years.

The court heard that he had enjoyed massages at The Dorchester Hotel, was given pricey meals at Browns in Mayfair, and is normally seen driving around in a BMW or Mercedes.

According to the Evening Standard, his new job as a designer involves him looking at fashion magazines and 'tweaking' their appearances. 

Adams claimed fashion is his 'one love' and had followed the career path after struggling to find work in the jewellery industry. 

He told the court: 'The only source of income I get is from my wife. I feel like a ponce. I get frustrated because I’m not bringing in any money. 

'She’s the breadwinner. It’s difficult for me. It causes no end of arguments in our flat. It doesn’t stop.' 

Explaining his trips to high-class restaurants and hotels, he said they had been paid for by 'others' including his sister-in-law's boyfriend. 

Kennedy Talbot, representing the CPS, suggested to Mr Adams at London's High Court today that loans said to have been taken out by his wife because times were hard were not genuine.

Cross-examining Mr Adams he said: 'These are not genuine loans at all. This is just your money being routed to you through fabricated arrangements.'

Denying the accusation, Mr Adams replied that he had said all along, from the time when he was in prison, that he had no money.

Mr Adams said to Mr Talbot: 'Now we are here and you are saying we have this money I have not got, but how do I prove this to you?'

The CPS says Mr and Mrs Adams' average 'identifiable' spending in the three years from September 2010-2013 was £97,000 per annum - 'nearly four times the national average'.

The type of spending was 'inconsistent' with his claim of having no assets and of being reliant on friends and family loans for living expenses, Mr Talbot has told the court.

The CPS said Mrs Adams had spent £12,044 on dental treatment, and £2,500 on a dietary programme during three months in 2013.

In June 2010 she bought a spa membership at a North London country club for £3,850. 

Lavish: He told the court he was treated to four meals at The Ivy in west London (pictured) as well as a massage at The Dorchester Hotel 

The couple had also spent nearly £15,000 on flights, hotels, restaurants and entertainment from August 2009-September 2013. Another £5,351 had gone on parking charges, fines and the congestion charge.

Mr Talbot argued that the evidence showed a pattern of behaviour that was 'entirely consistent with the original criminal case against (Mr Adams) of concealing his assets through associates and using sham companies to provide an apparent form of legitimate income'.

Adams and his brothers Sean (known as Tommy) and Patrick rose to power in the 1980s and were linked to drug trafficking, extortions, hijackings, security fraud and large-scale operations including the Brinks Mat robbery at Heathrow Airport in 1985.

Based in Clerkenwell, North London, they evaded prosecution for years by running their syndicate at arm's length but were once described as 'worse than the Krays'.

Claims: He said he is too poor to pay £750,000 as part of a confiscation order and wants to have the debt cleared on grounds of 'poverty'
