A family is in hiding after the wrong magistrate was accused of being responsible for the release on bail of deranged terrorist Man Haron Monis.

Police have been regularly monitoring the family home of Darryl Pearce after he was incorrectly singled out as the presiding court official who released Monis, despite the 50-year-old facing more than 40 offences.

'They are very overwhelmed by it all,' a family friend told Daily Mail Australia.

The self-proclaimed sheik, Man Haron Monis, was on bail facing charges of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, when he stormed the central Sydney cafe on Monday and held 17 people hostage. Monis and two of his hostages died at the end of the near 17-hour siege.

But a mix-up over whether the magistrate's name was Pierce or Pearce has caused heartache for the latter. Mr Pearce's family have been the subject of tirades of abuse, and even death threats, after it was claimed, incorrectly, that he had made the bail decision. 

'I guess is a natural reaction by some members of the public who feel obliged to stick their head up and make an issue of it but sometimes they do too much,' the Daily Mail was told.

The woman wouldn't elaborate on the level of threats but confirmed there had been serious warnings levelled at the Pearce family and police were at the premises.

'They're worried about the unknown, the fact that it has gone way too far and they were wrongly singled out especially by those who are just ranting about the issue and using the wrong name.

'They just want to keep their heads down and are very guarded about who they speak to now.'

The Department of Justice refused to confirm that Mr Pearce and his family were under police protection, a spokesman telling Daily Mail Australia that they would not be drawn on the matter.

'We will not be making comment about any apparent threats against the judiciary and cannot reveal any security arrangements,' he said.

First it was floral tributes now Sydney has taken to placing chalk messages to the victims of the Martin Place siege

Monis, whose real name is recorded as Mohammad Hassas Manteghi, was due to face court on February 27 next year. He was placed on a good behaviour bond in 2013 when he wrote a series of offensive letters to families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan.

But within a year he had been charged with being an accessory to his ex-wife's murder and more than 40 sex offences against several women.

Ms Pal, 30, was stabbed to death and set alight in April 2013 in a Werrington unit block in western Sydney. Monis' then partner, Amirah Droudis, 34, has been charged with her murder.

He had been released on bail in December last year on the accessory charge under the old bail laws. It has since been reported that Magistrate William Pierce said that the crown, in fact, had a weak case against Monis and that the pair did not represent a threat to the public.

'If there is a threat, it was to this woman who was murdered,' Pierce was reporting as saying.

However, he reappeared in court on May 26, only days after new bail laws came into effect, and again in October over new sexual assault offences. He was deemed then to pose an 'unacceptable risk to interfering with witnesses and endangering the safety of victims and individuals in the community'.

But the 50-year-old committed sexual offences against women in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September 2014.

The assaults committed in his registered business called Spiritual Consultation included sexual intercourse without consent and rubbing of genitalia during sessions in which he apparently acted as a 'spiritual healer'.

Further court documents show he threatened to shoot the mother of his two sons at Minchinbrook  in western Sydney, almost two years before Noleen Hayson Pal was murdered.

Flowers are left as a sign of respect at Martin Place in Sydney. Lone gunman Man Haron Monis, was shot dead by police in the early hours of Tuesday morning after taking hostages at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe Two other people died, 33-year-old cafe manager Tori Johnson and 38-year-old Sydney barrister Katrina Dawson.

According to an interview at St Mary's Police Station on July 27, 2011, Monis threatened Ms Pal after they had split up and demanded custody of their children, then aged seven and three.

Ms Pal, who told police she was afraid of Monis, had met him at a local fast food outlet a week earlier to discuss custody.

Police say Monis told her 'if I can't see the kids more than I am now, you're going to pay, even I I have to shoot you'.

Court documents from 2011, when he was charged with stalking and intimidating his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal, reveal he had a firearm licence while working as a security officer, but it had expired.

The file also shows that he allegedly threatened to shoot his former partner if his demands were not met. But the 2011 charges against Monis of stalking or intimidating his wife were dropped. He told police he was just 'a protective father' and wanted full custody of his sons because he feared they were being maltreated.

Asked about the threat to shoot Ms Pal he said 'I didn't threaten her'. Monis told investigating officers that he was a former 'security offficer in Australia' and that he had previously held a forearm licence and gone target shooting.

But Ms Pal, who became Monis' de-facto wife some nine years before she was murdered, died in a brutal killing on the afternoon of Sunday, April 21.

Lured to his Werrington flat, she was set upon, stabbed 18 times and then doused with an accelerant and set alight. Neighbours in the block reported seeing a woman in a black cape run from the flat.

It was not until seven months later, in October 2013, that police arrested and charged Monis' girlfriend, Amirah Droudis with murder and charged him with being an accessory to murder before and after the fact.

Police opposed bail, and he was put in custody where he complained that he'd been 'tortued' and had 'excrement' thrown on him. But last December he was released on bail.

In April this year, he was charged with sexual assault, and was granted bail.

However, a further 40 sexual assault charges were laid against Monis on October 10, but he was still allowed to walk free. His bail conditions included not going within 500 metres of an airport, not approaching witnesses or victims, reporting every day to Campsie Police Station and surrendering his passport.
