Two years ago, Andrea Pirlo was the man who defied his age to ensure his side progressed past England at Euro 2012, his outrageous chipped penalty punctuating an immaculate display of passing and vision.

To remain that cool and calm in the face of such intense pressure was incredible to witness, but many wondered just how long he would remain at the top of his game.

The bad news for England – and indeed any side who face Italy this summer – is that there is still no sign of the 35-year-old starting to wane.

With many players, the idea of them losing ‘a yard of pace’ as they enter the autumn of their career is a genuine concern, but even the most ardent fan would struggle to remember Pirlo ever sprinting.

However, while it will surprise no one to learn that his 131 passes were more than all four England midfielder’s combined in that Euro 2012 quarter final, the fact that he also covered more distance – a staggering 11.58km in a single game – is an eye-opening statistic.

He plays the game in the same calm, calculated manner he approached that spot-kick against Joe Hart, never hurried and always able to find time and space to deliver an incisive pass.

It is incredible to think that he has been a part of the last four title winning sides in Serie A, enjoying an undefeated season with Juventus in 2011-12 before helping them net a record 102 points this term.

The man Paul Scholes this week called 'the world’s greatest playmaker,' had another superb campaign, completing 88.5 per cent of his passes but there is so much more to his game than his ability to consistently find a team-mate with the ball.

'He’s one of those players who allows you to dream,' Gigi Buffon told reporters after watching his team-mate curl home a last-minute free kick to win a match against Genoa recently.

That narrow 1-0 victory was viewed as the tipping point in this year’s title race in Italy, yet another punctuated by the greatness of the man in the Juventus no. 21 shirt. It was his fourth goal of the season as he headed towards his final tally of six, and all of them came from set-pieces around the edge of the area, highlighting yet another facet to his game that opponents would do well to heed. In that same interview, former Manchester United midfielder Scholes went on to say that England 'cannot repeat the mistakes of Euro 2012.'

Those errors appear to be commonplace outside of Italy, where people seem less aware of Pirlo’s all-round excellence.

Of the England squad headed to Brazil, only Steven Gerrard (98) and Jordan Henderson (83) recorded more tackles (43) than the bearded Italian in 2013-14, while only the Liverpool skipper’s tally of 48 interceptions were higher than Pirlo’s 39.

He may well be two years older than the last time he put England to the sword, but Andrea Pirlo continues to be the metronomic beating heart of Italy’s midfield.
