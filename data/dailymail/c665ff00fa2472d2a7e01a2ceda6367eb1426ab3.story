Louis van Gaal's Manchester United were able to exact revenge on Leicester City thanks to goals from Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and an own goal by Wes Morgan.

The away side, who claimed a surprise 5-3 win against United back in September, pulled one back through Marcin Wasilewski but his effort proved to be nothing more than a consolation goal.

Sportsmail's Mike Keegan rated the players at Old Trafford.

Robin van Persie scored his ninth Premier League goal of the season against Leicester 

MANCHESTER UNITED 

David de Gea 6

Pipe and slippers for the Spaniard who, especially in recent seasons, will not have had many quieter afternoons. Denied Nugent with ease but will have been disappointed with Leicester's consolation.

Antonio Valencia 7

Continues to thrive at right back. Another commanding performance packed with attacking intent before being replaced by Mata.

Phil Jones 6.5

Dally almost let Nugent in. Ability to drop a needless clanger remains but otherwise assured.

Marcos Rojo 7

A reassuring presence at the back. An easy afternoon but is beginning to look a shrewd piece of business. Stood up well to Ulloa.

Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo kept a close eye on fellow countryman Leonardo Ulloa

Luke Shaw 7

Encouraging from the left back. Was given little to cope with defensively and was willing in attack.

Angel di Maria 7

Back in his favoured position behind the striker the Argentina playmaker was wasteful early on but surged forward and his parried shot set up Falcao. Not a bad outing and should have scored late on.

Daley Blind 7.5

Beautiful dinked ball over the top for Van Persie to open the scoring. Picked up the pieces and allowed others to attack with confidence.

Wayne Rooney 7

Reassured by the defensive qualities of Blind and willing runners to aim for. A decent 90 minutes in midfield for the captain.

Adnan Januzaj 6.5

Anonymous early but became more confident. Did well to win the corner which led to the third. 

Radamel Falcao 7.5

Got his feet stuck underneath him when played in by Van Persie but was sharp to scramble home Di Maria's rebound for the second.

Robin van Persie 8

Admitted he needed more goals and his neat half-volley gave United the lead. Kick-started the move for the second and came through 68 minutes unscathed.

Subs: Paddy McNair (on 68) 6

Job done by the time the youngster replaced Van Persie.

Juan Mata (on 77) 6

Will have been disappointed to find himself on the bench with 13 minutes to make an impression and played more of a defensive role as the visitors pressed.

James Wilson (on 80) 6

Replaced Falcao but may now find himself behind the Colombian in the pecking order. Wasted a half chance.

LEICESTER CITY

Mark Schwarzer 6

The big Aussie had no chance with any of the goals and was regularly exposed by a shaky backline.

Leicester goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer was unable to keep the likes of Falcao and Van Persie at bay

Ritchie De Laet 6

Will have been keen to impress back at Old Trafford and put in a strong performance, surging down the left when he could. 

Marcin Wasilewski 6.5

Offered little going forward until late and could have been stronger to prevent Falcao scrambling home the second but took his header well.

Wes Morgan 5

Given a tough time by Falcao and headed into his own net to make it 3-0. Not a great afternoon for the big captain.

Danny Simpson 5

Played in sub Cambiasso for a rare opening but struggled to contain United's left. Not a happy homecoming for the Salford boy.

Danny Drinkwater 5

Booked for a nasty foul on Shaw. Another in the Leicester ranks who will not have enjoyed a return to the club he started his career with.

Former United midfielder Danny Drinkwater was unable to stop Morgan's header from landing in the net

Andy King 6

After a bright opening the Welshman failed to contain a rampant United midfield and spent long periods on the back foot in a damage limitation role.

Jeffrey Schlupp 5

Almost caught napping by Di Maria early on. Probed when he could but was nullified by the excellent Blind. Not strong enough. 

Leonardo Ulloa 5

On his own up front and at times isolated. The big man cut a frustrated figure and was offered no service. Yanked after an hour.

Andrej Kramaric 5

Struggled to make an impact, the only Leicester layer wearing gloves was at fault for the first goal, his dallying allowing Blind to set up Van Persie and tried a ridiculous scissor-kick in the second half. Subbed on 63.

Jamie Vardy 5

Sacrificed at half-time for Esteban Cambiasso. A harsh decision as most of United's threat had come from the opposite side of the pitch.

Subs: Esteban Cambiasso (on 46) 6

The game, like the Argentine's best years, had gone by the time he was introduced.

Experienced midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, pictured with Rooney, replaced Jamie Vardy at the interval 

Marc Albrighton (on 63) 6.5 

Sent on in the desperate hope of triggering a revival, the former Villa man should be blameless, especially after his fine cross set up Wasilewski.

David Nugent (on 63) 6 

Given the thankless task of replacing Ulloa and should have done better from a Jones error but was denied by De Gea.
