Andros Townsend has revealed how he offered Roberto Soldado words of consolation at half-time after the out-of-form striker missed from three yards out against Burnley.

Soldado has not scored for almost a month but Townsend gave him the easiest of finishes when he picked him out at the back post with a low cross in their FA Cup third-round victory on Wednesday night.

But the forward’s confidence plumbed further depths when he somehow managed to hit the crossbar. Townsend ran over to his team-mate when the half-time whistle went just moments later in an attempt to help.

‘I felt for him,’ Townsend said. ‘I have been in that position before where just nothing will go in for you. He played well but as a striker I think he just wanted that goal.

‘I just ran over to him as we walked off at half-time and tried to keep his spirits up. I just told him to forget about the miss and keep going.

‘I said I would try to put another cross in for him and that if he kept getting into the positions then he would get a goal. That didn’t happen sadly but five minutes into the second half he put in an assist for Danny Rose.’

Setting up Tottenham’s fourth of the night was at least some consolation for Soldado, who was also unfortunate when Ross Wallace’s free kick took a vicious deflection off him to wrong-foot Michel Vorm and bounce in for Burnley’s second.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino defended the player afterwards, but patience is wearing thin for a player who cost £26million 18 months ago.

Townsend, however, has backed Soldado to eventually find form. ‘Look Robbie is a fantastic character he will pick himself up and dust himself down,’ he added.

‘He continued to look dangerous in the second half and I was delighted he played well.

‘We have seen in Spain he is a fantastic striker. He just needs the service and the game time. Then once he gets one or two goals I am sure the goals will start flowing.’
