Alesha Dixon has quit the judging panel of Strictly Come Dancing.

The pop star, who controversially replaced choreographer Arlene Phillips in 2009, is leaving after three series on the BBC show.

Her departure comes just hours before ITV is set to unveil its new panel for Britain's Got Talent, prompting speculation she may have been lured by a big money deal to swap sides.

I'm off! Alesha Dixon has quit BBC talent show Strictly Come Dancing after three series

In a statement, Miss Dixon said: 
'After three incredible years on the Strictly Come Dancing judging panel I 
have decided that it is time to move on.

'Strictly Come Dancing will always 
hold a special place in my heart as it has been such an amazing 
experience, both as a winning competitor and as a judge.

'I would like to say a big thank you 
to everyone involved in the show, the production team, my fellow 
judges, and a very special thank you to the fans for their support.

'Music is my great passion and the 
reason for the other incredible opportunities that have come my way and I
 am looking forward to getting back into the studio and focusing on 
making a new record in 2012.'

Who will replace her? Who will sit with Craig Revel Horwood, Len Goodman and Bruno Tonioli?

A BBC spokesperson said: 'We wish her all the best.

'She has done three very successful series with us and we look forward to announcing our new line-up in due course.'

Dixon, 33, famously won the fifth series of Strictly in 2007 with her professional partner Matthew Cutler.

It
 was a career resurgence for the Hertfordshire singer, who had been dropped from
 her record company and split from ex-husband, rapper Michael Harvey, after discovering 
his affair with singer Javine Hylton.

Her appointment on the Strictly panel caused controversy, with the BBC being accused of 'ageism' after sacking Phillips, who is 36 years older than Dixon.

During
 her time on Strictly, Dixon was rumoured to be the highest paid judge 
on the panel, earning more than Craig Revel-Horwood, Len Goodman and 
Bruno Tonioli.

Despite being the least experienced in terms of dancing, her celebrity status and interest from rival talent shows landed her a reported £100,000 salary.

In a recent interview, Dixon admitted she hoped to build her TV career and dreamed of being the 'British Oprah'.

She told the Mail On Sunday's You magazine: 'I haven't got an exact time scale for it. I can't say I want to do it in five years, or ten, but that's the ultimate goal.

'I would love to have my own chat 
show. I'd love to be able to address serious issues, and keep a foot in 
the entertainment world. I just want to do it all, and I think you can. 
Oprah has.'

Following her Strictly triumph, Dixon signed to a new record label and her second album The Alesha Show was certified platinum.

However,
 her follow-up disc The Entertainer failed to captivate the British 
music buying public and peaked at No.84 on the album charts.

In June, Dixon announced she and Asylum Records had parted ways, citing 'creative differences'.
