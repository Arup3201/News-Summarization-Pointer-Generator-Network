Former Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis could be in line for a remarkable return to Selhurst Park, with bookmakers Coral dropping his price to just 6/1 to be the next manager.

Elsewhere odds on Pulis are as low as 7/2, whereas just yesterday he was listed at around 140/1 by some bookmakers.

It is a big task to fill the shoes of a manager who left the club having just been named Premier League Manager of the Season. So who better to replace such a man than...the Premier League Manager of the season.

Return? Bookmakers have slashed the odds on Tony Pulis making a dramatic return to management

Pulis left the club just two days before the start of the Premier League season by mutual consent, with a disagreement over transfer policy causing him to fall out with co-chairman Steve Parish.

Former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay was favourite to take over from Pulis, but Crystal Palace have distanced themselves from the manager after the emergence of allegedly racist and sexist text messages, which also led to the resignation of sporting director Iain Moody.

With Moody no longer in charge of transfer policy, and Mackay no longer an option, Pulis has moved up the pecking order to be the next Palace boss.

Tim Sherwood has also ruled himself out of the running for the job, leaving the way open for Pulis to return.

However, the Welshman is still not the outright favourite for the job. Caretaker manager Keith Millen and former West Brom boss Steve Clarke are both at 5/1 with Coral, while Neil Lennon is favourite at 2/1.
