The trusty mascot of a basketball team seems to have upstaged the players during a match at the weekend - proving that maybe the team needs him on their side.

The Sydney Kings' Lion launched himself into unprecedented territory when he took the weekly half-time shot during the first game of the season against the Wollongong Hawks at the weekend.

According to Pedestrian TV, this is the third time in twenty years the no-look half-court basket has been sunk by the Kings' mascot.

The aim of the exercise is to shoot a hoop by launching the ball backwards over one's head without looking, and the Lion did just that.

Footage shows the furry mascot prepping himself for the throw by dribbling the ball on the ground in front of him.

When he's ready the Sydney Kings Lion throws the ball towards the hoop behind him and quickly spins around to see if he was successful.

Ecstatic with his impressive feat the Lion sprints around the stadium in a victory lap as the crowd goes wild.

The Kings' cheerleaders can be seen waving their gold pom-poms in celebration as the mascot circles the arena with one arm held triumphantly in the air.

The Lion continues his victory dance by jumping on fellow members of the basketball team's support embracing a male who looks to be the referee before giving a nearby female a hug.

A spokesperson for Sydney Kings told Daily Mail Australia that was the first time in history that the mascot landed the trick shot during the opening match of the season.

The team went on to win the game against the Wollongong Hawks 86-83.
