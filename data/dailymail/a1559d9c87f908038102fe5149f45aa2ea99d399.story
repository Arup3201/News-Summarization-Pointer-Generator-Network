Shaun Maloney has completed his move to MLS side Chicago Fire from Championship Wigan.

The Scotland international had been at Wigan for three and a half years and was part of the team that beat Manchester City to win the FA Cup in 2013.

Maloney, who was 32 on Saturday, has signed for the MLS side and will be officially presented as team's third Designated Player - alongside David Accam and Kennedy Igboananike - on Monday.

'I'm very happy to be joining the Fire,' said Maloney. 'I owe a lot to the manager Frank Yallop and the owner Andrew Hauptman for getting this done.

'I certainly didn't expect it to get done this quickly, so I appreciate the faith that they've shown in me. It's a brilliant league and I'm really hopeful that I'm going to enjoy Chicago and be a big part of what the club is building.

'I'd also like to show respect for my previous club and thank the owner and manager over at Wigan for letting this happen.'

A proposed move to Premier League Leicester collapsed this month after the clubs had agreed a fee for the winger, out of contract in the summer.

Chicago Fire head coach Frank Yallop called Maloney a 'hard-working, attack-minded player'.

He said: 'His style of play fits in exactly with what we're trying to do at the Fire. He's a hard-working, attack-minded player who is really going to help this team and we're excited to have signed him.'
