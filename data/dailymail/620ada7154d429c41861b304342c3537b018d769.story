The man whose office romp with a junior went viral this week is a senior insurance broker in his late 40s, Daily Mail Australia can reveal.

The man involved in the Christchurch office sex romp with a woman almost half his age is a regional manager at Marsh Ltd insurance firm, and is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter.

He had a steamy encounter with a company secretary in her 20s  in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action.

The man at the centre of the New Zealand office sex romp which went viral has been revealed as a husband and father of two aged in his late 40s

Video footage and photographs by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide. 

Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man’s wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook.

A friend of the man’s brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved.

‘When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,’ the friend said.

‘After he didn’t reply he even asked, ‘It’s not you is it?’ He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.’

When the Daily Mail Australia called at the regional manager’s house in the affluent Christchurch suburb of Sumner to speak with him on Saturday, the man refused to open his door or answer any questions.

The couple's office sex scandal which took place last Friday night went viral after patrons at the pub across the road captured the intimate moment

The man's wife only found out about the affair when it went viral on Facebook, and is said to be devastated by the revelations

‘Get off these premises, get off these premises,’ was all he said from behind his front door. He then refused to reply to questions at all. The man appeared to be home alone despite it being the Waitangi Day weekend bank holiday.

However, when the Daily Mail Australia visited the premises the day before it was his wife that answered the door. She said that her husband was not at home and would not comment on the incident.

‘I’ve got nothing to say. He’s not here,’ she said.

The wife's friends were supporting her, a neighbour said. It’s clear the marriage has an uncertain future.

A neighbour that lived a few houses away and who claimed he'd known the family for years, was shocked at what had happened and had 'no explanation' for the senior manager's behaviour.

Patrons at the Carlton Bar and Eatery captured the scandalous behaviour last Friday evening 

There are reports the senior broker has been sacked over the incident, but the firm claims the internal investigation is still ongoing

The man, aged in his 40s, would not answer questions and appeared to be home alone this weekend

‘It’s all come as a bit of a shock. I still can’t believe it has happened. I’ve no explanation for it at all,’ the neighbour said.

‘It’s very, very sad. He’s a lovely guy. I’ve no idea why he would do it. He and his wife have been very good to me over the years and are a lovely couple.’

Earlier this week the ex-fiancé of the woman involved in the sex romp said their engagement was already over before the incident, and that it's sad 'for everyone involved'.

Identifying himself only as ‘Josh’ he told The Edge radio station on Friday morning that they were no longer engaged and had split up weeks before the erotic encounter.

He said he knew the other man who appeared in the video, but had never met him.

‘I think for everyone involved it's quite sad,’ he said.

An insurance industry insider said that the man had been sacked from his job over the incident. But the firm has only confirmed that an internal investigation is still ongoing. 

The  secretary's ex-fiance spoke a few days ago, saying they had split a few weeks prior
