Former head of Knox Grammar Ian Paterson has denied touching a young woman's bottom during a school musical to the cheering of young boys, as he admitted deliberately hindering a 1996 investigation into child sex abuse.

In the second shocking day of evidence at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse, Dr Paterson said he did 'absolutely not' touch Lucy Perry, who was 15-years-old, during a rehearsal of 'Guys and Dolls' in 1989.

'They were roaring their approval for her performance as the sultry dancer,' Dr Paterson told the inquiry, under intense questioning from counsel assisting the commission David Lloyd.  

Dr Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Knox Grammar, has provided evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse for two days

Lucy Perry, the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson had touched her behind during a rehearsal of Guys and Dolls. She said the action was greeted by a 'roar of approval' from young men in the crowd

Lucy Perry was surprised by the reaction her testimony triggered from victims attending the inquiry, with many standing up to applaud her as she left

In explosive testimony on Wednesday, Dr Paterson also accepted he had hindered a police investigation of claims into child sex abuse led by Inspector Elizabeth Cullen in 1996.

Ian Paterson said on Wednesday that when a police inspector from the child protection unit approached him in 1996 about six teachers at Knox about whom there had been complaints, he did not give her full information. 

In reply to David Lloyd counsel advising the royal commission, which is inquiring into Knox's handling of sex abuse complaints, Dr Paterson agreed he knew this would impede the investigation.  

Ms Perry, 41, now the CEO of an international women's charity, told the commission on Monday that Dr Paterson, the show's producer, had singled her out during the joint rehearsal between Knox and Roseville College.

As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. 

'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission.

'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and (I) felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' 

Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering.

'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.'

Ms Perry was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009.

'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said.

Knox Grammar former headmaster Ian Paterson said on Tuesday that he is 'deeply and profoundly sorry' for failing to recognise and respond to child sex abuse perpetrated while he was head of the school 

 Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student

His testimony followed a day of evidence on Tuesday where it emerged Dr Paterson allowed teachers he knew had abused children to stay on staff for years.

Others he suspected of sexually abusing students were allowed to resign and Dr Paterson wrote them positive letters of recommendation following their departures.

The hearing on Tuesday also heard that the student files of abuse victims went missing from the school, and no detailed records of sex abuse allegations relating to teachers and students were recorded in their files.

Dr Paterson said Knox conducted a number of internal investigations into abuse suffered by students without reporting the cases the authorities, but repeatedly denied that incidences were kept from police or DOCs to protect the school's reputation.

He said he made the decision not to sack one teacher who watched hardcore pornography with students in 1987 because the man had 'made a very silly mistake' and had 'enormous potential in the profession'.

In a case involving another teacher in 1987, Dr Paterson said he sent a 15-year-old student to the library to 'think about what he said' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a 'dramatical boy' who 'liked to exaggerate stories'.

Dr Paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava-clad 'intruder' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a Year 8 student in 1988.

He added that he did not think to report the matter to police even after he formed a suspicion the attack was perpetrated by a staff member.

On Tuesday, Dr Paterson was questioned about former teacher Craig Treloar who worked at the school until 2009 despite Dr Paterson being aware of the pornography incident that occurred in 1987. Treloar was convicted of child sex abuse in 2010 and sentenced to jail for two years.

Dr Paterson said former Knox general duties master Stuart Pearson called him late in 1987 and told him Treloar had shown pornography to a young student.

He said he had not asked any further details, including how many boys were shown the tape, how often it had occurred or if he'd propositioned any boys.

The hearing continues through Wednesday.
