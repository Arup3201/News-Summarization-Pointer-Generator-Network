Eliaquim Mangala has revealed he’d prefer a move to Chelsea rather than Manchester City because the Blues are based in London.

The Porto centre back has been a long-term target for City boss Manuel Pellegrini while Chelsea are also keen to bring Mangala to the Premier League.

However, judging by the France defender's recent comments, it seems he is keen on a move to the Blues in the capital rather than joining the recently-crowned champions.

City boy? Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala has revealed he'd prefer a move to Chelsea over Man City

He told BeIn Sports: ‘City or Chelsea? Chelsea because it is London.

‘It is true that I love the Premier League because it is a spectacular championship. In January, there were discussions with City, but it fell through because the two clubs could not reach an agreement.

Location isn't the only factor Mangala is 
considering, though. The 23-year-old is keen to join the club which will give him the best 
chance of winning silverware.

‘Every player wants to play in the biggest clubs. I am an ambitious player and the team that can help me win titles is the one that interests me.’

Mangala has been named in France's 23-man squad ahead of this summer's World Cup where the French will face Switzerland, Honduras and Ecuador.
