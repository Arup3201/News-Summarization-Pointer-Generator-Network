Sophie Dalzell, 19, refused to wear an ankle tag as she claimed it would interfere with her work as a soft porn model

An adult TV star convicted of vandalism was let off from wearing an electronic tag on her ankle – because it would ruin her on-screen work.

Sophie Dalzell, 19, was placed on a curfew and ordered to wear a tag for eight weeks after failing to carry out community service.

But when security firm G4S turned up to fit the tag she refused to let them put it on. She told them ‘appearance is everything’ on adult TV – and that she would be sacked if she turned up to work with a plastic tag on her ankle.

Incredibly, when the presenter was hauled back to court, she successfully appealed against having the tag fitted after explaining it would compromise her career.

Instead magistrates fined the glamour model £200 with £75 costs after she admitted breaching a community order.

After the case the model, who has appeared topless in men’s magazines, said: ‘A tag on my ankle wouldn’t look very good. It’s an eyesore. Your appearance is everything. I’m still mad about the whole situation.’ Dalzell, of Manchester, added: ‘If I’d let them put the tag on, I’d have had no job and nowhere to live. I was doing adult channels, TV presenting.

‘I still don’t think it’s fair about the fine. I now want to get on with my life.’

Magistrates were told she no longer works in adult TV and has moved into modelling, photo shoots, hosting and other presenting jobs.

Ms Dalzell  was ordered to wear the ankle tag after she failed to complete a 100 hour community service order

She was first hauled before the courts
in March last year after she became involved in a row outside 5th 
Avenue nightclub in Manchester. During a dispute with the male driver of
a BMW car, she slapped him in the face and kicked his car causing 
damage.

As well as ordering her to pay £150 
compensation, magistrates gave her a probation order and sentenced her 
to do 100 hours of unpaid work in the community.

But she breached the order by not 
carrying out all the hours and on December 13, G4S staff turned up at 
her flat with the tag. Matthew Wallace, defending, said: ‘The problem 
was that at that time Miss Dalzell had a contract with an agency for TV 
glamour modelling. She couldn’t do that with the tag on her ankle.’

Ms Dalzell claimed that the £200 fine was unfair and said she was 'mad' about the siituation

Dalzell initially denied breaching the
order when she appeared in the dock at Manchester Magistrates’ Court 
wearing a black dress, false eyelashes, bright red lipstick and diamond 
earrings.

But she changed her plea to guilty 
after telling the court a future trial date would conflict with a 
modelling assignment she had in Ibiza.

Magistrates told Dalzell it is essential she pays the fine within 28 days or she may face further legal repercussions.
