Girls as young as nine described their ideal woman as a ‘pretty’ blonde who dresses provocatively to attract men, according to shocking new research.

A group of 13-14 year-olds revealed that she would wear ‘tight’ tops, expose her bra straps to get attention from men and have expensive clothes.

Asked to describe her, they used words such as a 'whore' and 'slutty' and said she would be promiscuous.

More worryingly, an even younger group - aged between nine and 11 - said a woman should be ‘interested in guys’ and ‘snobby’.

And when asked to draw their ideal woman, almost every girl from both groups produced a thin, blonde and white figure - even those children of non-white ethnicity.

The findings came as researchers studied body image issues among young girls.

Professor Niva Piran of the University of Toronto asked two groups of girls aged nine to 11 and 13-14 to draw ‘the ideal woman’.

The younger children unanimously depicted a blonde, blue-eyed girl with expensive clothes, high heels and 'tight' clothes.

The older girls drew a similar looking woman, describing her as promiscuous and stupid but physically attractive.

Presenting the research at an international conference on body image at the University of the West of England in Bristol, Prof Piran said: 'What happens between the two groups is that the older girls start policing other women.

'They want to look like that but say she is stupid. So they are demoting themselves with this ideal. They are even uncomfortable in their own ideals. Their ideal woman was a double-edged sword.'

She added: 'What we see is a constant failure to accept diversity, so we have a lot of work left to do.'

Other speakers at the conference noted the negative influences of social media on how young people viewed their body image.

Professor Ann Frisen of the University of Gothenberg examined the effects of cyber bullying on teenagers by studying a group of 15 year-old girls and boys.

The girls admitted they feared being criticised for their looks and strongly desired admiration from people online, even if they are strangers.

Prof Frisen said: 'They are opening themselves up to such nasty comments, making themselves so vulnerable because they want so much to have someone post something complimentary or flattering.

'It’s worth the risk to them.'

Most girls admitted they were cruellest to other girls while teenage boys said they feared posting photographs of themselves online in case they were called 'gay' by their peers.

Jon Brown, head of sexual abuse programmes at the NSPCC, said: 'What we see with studies like these is that children don’t feel they can be themselves.

'We’ve noticed a significant increase in the number of children calling Childline and talking about the pressure they feel to look a certain way.

'Some of them say they don’t want to be seen in public because they’re too upset. It’s really very worrying considering they’re meant to be enjoying their childhoods.
