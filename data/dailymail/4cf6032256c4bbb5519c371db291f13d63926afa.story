Tragedy: Neville Freeman, 79, (pictured) known as Tony, shot himself dead after suffering months of misdiagnosed crippling abdominal pains that turned out to be cancer

A businessman who correctly feared he had cancer shot himself dead eight months after doctors had misdiagnosed him with stomach ulcers, an inquest heard.

Father-of-two Neville Freeman, 79, suffered crippling abdominal pains and had begged for a cancer check because his sister died of the disease after she was misdiagnosed.

Experts assured Mr Freeman, known as Tony, that he was cancer-free and prescribed him anti-acid tablets to treat stomach ulcers.

But the pain became unbearable and eight months later Mr Freeman took his own life with his clay pigeon gun before a post mortem examination found he did have cancer.

After the inquest friends claimed the veteran RAF civilian firefighter would still be alive is his concerns had been listened to.

Gary Hughes, 60, who was a neighbour in Feltwell, Norfolk, said he 'lost the will to live' because of the agony he was in.

He said: 'I believe Tony thought he had the cancer - like his sister - and he was right.

'He told me he was really fed up. Then they delayed his appointments and that made it worse.

'He hadn't lost his mind, but he lost the will to live.

'Tony was not mentally ill, he was just in so much pain. In the note to me he said he couldn't stand the pain anymore.

'He was in such a bad condition, he couldn't eat or even drink a cup of tea. He felt life wasn't worth living.

'Maybe if he had been diagnosed they could have treated him for cancer and he might still be here.

'It is disappointing that the inquest did investigate why he was misdiagnosed.

'It is worrying to think that what happened to Tony could happen to other people. The reasons why his cancer was not picked up need to be investigated.'

Error: Mr Freeman saw medics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk, but was mistakenly told he was not suffering from cancer

He added: 'He had said three of four times about ending his own life but we didn't think he was being serious.

'Even if I had known I don't think there's much I could have done about it.'

Mr Freeman, who had owned forestry and transport businesses, shot himself at his home in February.

His neighbours found his body in his garage when they called round to take his three dogs for a walk.

They found a note attached to the back door and two more in the kitchen.

An inquest heard that Mr Freeman was diagnosed with cancer in one of his eyes in 2011 and it was removed and replaced with a glass one.

When he developed painful stomach aches in June 2012 he was convinced the cancer had spread.

He saw medics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk, but was told he was not suffering from cancer.

He went back to his GP when the pain did not go away after taking anti-acid tablets, but was only prescribed painkillers.

A post mortem examination revealed a tumour in his pancreas which should have been diagnosed as pancreatic carcinoma.

Norfolk Coroner Jacqueline Lake recorded a verdict of suicide at King's Lynn County Court on Monday.
