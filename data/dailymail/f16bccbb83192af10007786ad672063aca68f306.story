In the hot seat: Scott Kveton, 40, the CEO of a Portland start-up, has been accused by his ex-girlfriend of repeatedly raping her

The CEO of a prominent Oregon tech start-up is being investigated for sexual assault after his ex-girlfriend came forward accusing him of repeatedly raping her.

Scott Kveton, the head of the Portland-based Urban Airship, has been publicly accused by his former paramour of being involved in a complicated physical relationship reminiscent of the bestselling erotica novel '50 Shades of Grey.'

Mr Kveton’s former girlfriend, who is not being named, provided a heap of emails and text messages to the police and the newspaper The Oregonian detailing her and Kveton's twisted love affair.

Kveton’s 
attorney, Stephen Houzer, has released a statement asking the media and 
the general public to accord his client 'the presumption of innocence 
that is the cornerstone of our system of American justice, a concept 
that can be so easily destroyed by the sensational reporting of 
salacious and unproven allegations.’

Meanwhile,
 Urban Airship declined to address the controversy surrounding the CEO, 
only stating that 'it’s clearly a very personal, private matter for 
Scott.'

As the 34-year-old accuser described to investigators, she and the 40-year-old CEO engaged in sexual role-playing and pushed each other's buttons.

But in numerous emails and text messages sent to Kveton, the lover claimed that he had gone too far.

The police investigation into allegations of sex assault revolves around incidents that took place in 2012 and 2013.

Mr Kveton has not been arrested or charged in connection to these allegations.

Prior to that, Kveton's ex-girlfriend reached out to police in 2010 and 2011 accusing the tech CEO of sexual abuse, but he has not been charged with any crime.

The bespectacled, bow tie-wearing Mr Kveton has been cultivating a family-friendly image, describing himself on his website and social media accounts as an  'entrepreneur, bacon lover and proud father.'

Kveton and his current girlfriend, Sarah Tuthill, are raising his two children.

The Oregon State University graduate has been getting glowing reviews for his stewardship of Urban Airship - a mobile marketing company that sends push notifications to smartphones promoting such brands as ESPN.com, Groupon and MSNBC.

He co-founded the tech firm with his friends five years ago after spending 12 years working as an engineer for several tech companies, including Amazon and Vidoop.

Only last month, Forbes published a highly flattering profile of Mr Kventon, marveling at his ability to raise $46million in venture funding from high-profile backers.

The article tracing Kveton's meteoric rise in the tech world laid out his credentials as a team leader and a marketing visionary; it also mentioned a few early failures, including the time he was fired from his first stint as a CEO.

The Forbes piece concluded with Kveton revealing that he hopes one day to take his firm public. 

But last week's article in The Oregonian tells a very different story about the tech wunderkind.   

Text messages and chat room exchanges between Kveton and his ex-girlfriend suggest that the two had a turbulent relationship.

Some of Kveton's missives allude to the fact that he may have videotaped sexual acts with the woman without her permission.

The couple's correspondence lays bare Kveton's alleged sexual proclivities, which included sex games with several women he had met online, one of them nicknamed 'Goldilocks,' and trips to a Portland swingers club.

According to his 34-year-old accuser, she first met Kveton online in 2008, and their relationship lasted off and on for five years until their final split in 2013.

When they first started dating, Kveton and the woman were married to other people, and for a time the lover was employed as a nanny for the CEO's family.

The first allegation against Kveton dates back to February 2010. The girlfriend told police that Kveton raped her as she slept on the couch in his home after a night of drinking.

In the days after the alleged assault, Kveton sent the woman a number of emails apologizing for what happened.

‘Believe me, the concept of not having you in my life absolutely and utterly makes my heart ache,’ according to an email from Kveton obtained by the paper.  ‘... and I can't believe how I treated you the other night ... I just felt so betrayed and hurt that night with all of the things you were saying ... that doesn't justify it whatsoever ... I'm just hurt and for some reason I took it out on you in that awful way.’

In other messages, Mr Kveton indicated that the sex act may have been recorded on video, prompting the woman to obtain a restraining order against him.

The order was later thrown out, and the couple eventually picked up where they left off.

A year later, the girlfriend contacted police once again accusing Kveton of ambushing her in a closet and wrapping her in a bear hug, after which he allegedly dragged her into a bedroom and tied her up by the wrists.

Scott Kveton was interviewed about the incident by police, but he denied the allegations and the prosecutors declined to charge him.

The 34-year-old accuser has made three more similar allegations against Kveton in connection to incidents in 2012 and 2013, which police are now investigating. 

The Kveton saga is only the latest in a series of sex scandals involving successful businessmen.

Last month, the founder and CEO of American Apparel was terminated over allegations of sexual misconduct.

Just days ago, Justin Mateen, the co-founder of the dating app Tinder, was suspended over sexual harassment claims made by a former employee.

In April, GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner was forced to resign over 'errors of judgment' also related to sexual harassment.
