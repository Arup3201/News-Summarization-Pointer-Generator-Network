Arrested: Robert Clark,  wanted in the killings of an elderly Ohio couple and in armed robberies in three states, was arrested early on Thursday in Arizona after a high-speed chase and nationwide manhunt

Dead: Robert Clark is wanted for the murder of Doyle, 88, and Lillian Chumney, 79, who were found dead in their burnt vehicle on a remote dirt road 30 miles away from their burglarized home last month

Escape van: The chase began when police spotted the suspects’ green 2003 Dodge Caravan and tried to conduct a traffic stop which led to a chase when Robert Clark did not stop 

Fox 8 reports that the chase began when police spotted the suspects’ green 2003 Dodge Caravan and tried to conduct a traffic stop. 

The suspects did not stop but instead tried to evade police. 

The suspects' van eventually turned onto a dirt road where it became disabled, and the suspects fled on foot.

During the chase, three police cruisers pulled up on brush and desert debris and caught on fire. 

As smoke and flames filled the air the deputies were able to arrest Clark and Hazel, but during the fire, Caley was able to escape.

Clark has been charged with one count of murder in the deaths of 88-year-old Doyle Chumney and his 79-year-old wife, Lillian.

Their remains were found inside their torched car on a country road January 22, the day after they were reported missing from their home.

The Chumneys had four children. Their daughter Diane Enama, who found her parents' home ransacked January 21, declined to comment on Thursday.

The FBI had offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to Clark's capture. It wasn't immediately clear Thursday whether anyone could claim the money.

A second suspect in the slayings, 21-year-old Jeffery Stewart, was arrested Saturday. He is charged with one count of murder and is being held on $2 million bond. Authorities have said Stewart implicated himself and Clark in the killings.

Clark, Caley and Hazel are suspected of being involved in the armed robberies of gas stations and convenience stores in West Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia on Saturday and Sunday. No one was hurt in the robberies.

The trio was last seen during a robbery in Donalsonville, Georgia, on Sunday night, said Tom Couts, a Coshocton County sheriff's detective.

Surveillance video shows Clark holding a sawed-off shotgun and Caley holding a pistol as a clerk walks in front of them. Hazel went inside the store before Clark and Caley entered, Couts said. 

Caley and Hazel were not involved in the Chumney slayings, Couts said. It appears that Clark and Stewart knew each other through a landscaping service where they had worked, Couts said. Clark was released from prison in May after serving a 4 1/2 -year sentence for robbery and other charges.

Couts said authorities believe the Chumneys were driven to a country road in Coshocton County where they were shot before their car was set on fire.

Authorities received a break in the investigation after surveillance video was released to the public that shows Clark's van at a gas station where Stewart bought a gas can and filled it, Couts said. Stewart called police after seeing the video. He was arrested on a traffic warrant and provided statements implicating himself and Clark, Couts said.

Accussed of murder: Jeffery Stewart. Stewart, 21, was arrested on Saturday January 31 and charged with murder in the slayings of Doyle Chumney, 88, and his 79-year-old wife, Lillian
