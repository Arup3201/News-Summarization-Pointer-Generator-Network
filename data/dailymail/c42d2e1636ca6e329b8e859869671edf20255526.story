Nigel Farage has indicated he would not stand in the way of local agreements with the most eurosceptic Tory MPs

Nigel Farage has cleared the way for local deals to ensure Ukip candidates do not stand against Tory MPs at the next general election.

The Ukip leader has refused to enter a formal electoral pact with the Conservative Party saying he is despised by David Cameron.

But he has indicated he would not stand in the way of agreements in local constituencies with the most eurosceptic MPs.

He said there are many MPs who take a different view from the Tory leadership on Europe, naming Peter Bone and Jacob Rees-Mogg.

He said: ‘If either they, or others like them, even Labour MPs, with their local associations, chose to propose running on a joint ticket then I would leave the local Ukip association to have those negotiations ... After all we are a party that believes in real localism and doesn’t think that the centre is the repository of all wisdom.’

Speaking about not being allowed into the secure zone of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester Mr Farage said: ‘It seems I am persona non grata.’

Writing in the Times he added: ‘To the Tory High Command I am a plague carrier.’

His remarks came as it emerged several Tory MPs are planning to run on ‘joint tickets’ with Ukip at the election. A handful of MPs  were said to be considering a ‘Unite the Right’ campaign to prevent Labour capitalising on a split vote following a surge in support for Mr Farage’s party.

The sitting Tory MP would stand as a Tory-Ukip candidate. In return for its support, Ukip would expect to be able to influence Conservative Party policy.

Nadine Dorries was the first to float the idea earlier this year, saying she would be ‘having that kind of conversation’ with activists in her constituency and that many Conservatives have ‘huge empathy’ with Ukip.

David Cameron pledged yesterday to remove all commitments to ‘ever-closer union’ from EU treaties.

In a hardening of his stance, the Prime Minister said he wanted to go as far as erasing the EU’s original mission statement, which commits nations to closer integration.

He said: ‘Others can sign up to an ever-closer union, but Britain should not. I’m determined to make sure we get out of that.’ 

Speaking at the Tory Party conference, Foreign Secretary William Hague also told delegates that more countries were coming round to Britain’s view that powers should be returned to individual countries.

Eight Tory-held seats are said to be at high risk of being lost because of Ukip splitting the traditional Tory vote and letting in Labour or the Lib Dems.

The proposal comes as the latest YouGov poll shows Labour has surged ahead, mainly at the expense of the Conservatives who are losing voters to Ukip. The poll puts Labour on 42 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, Ukip on 13 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent.

Miss Dorries said yesterday: ‘I know other MPs in marginal constituencies are in talks about entering into agreements. It’s going to be very difficult in the general election when you’ve got two candidates espousing the same sort of values.

‘We’ll have a Conservative candidate calling for a referendum, being strong on crime, immigration and grammar schools, and the Ukip candidate saying much the same sort of things.’

Conservative Central Office yesterday said joint tickets would not be allowed and any MP who tried would not have their nomination papers signed.

Foreign Secretary William Hague last night insisted Tories ‘don’t make pacts with other parties … we win over the voters of other parties’ and cautioned wavering supporters.

He said: ‘If someone is contemplating voting Ukip who would otherwise vote Conservative they could, by default, produce a Labour government which is the absolute opposite of what they might want on Europe for instance.’
