The money keeps growing but the odds are shortening as the richest fight of all time looks set to break the half-billion-dollar barrier.

Both Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are impressing video-watchers and hand-picked visitors to their gyms in Las Vegas and Los Angeles respectively with their dedication and work rate.

But a dramatic improvement in the speed and power of the PacMan’s sparring and pad-hitting in the ring have caught the eye of the so-called ‘smart money’ gamblers.

Floyd Mayweather's fight with Manny Pacquiao on May 2 is set to break the half-billion-dollar barrier

Pacquiao, who was a 3/1 shot when betting opened, is now down to 2/1 at best.

Mayweather, a red-hot odds-on favourite at 2/7 at the start has cooled to 2/3.

Some Vegas casinos are predicting what they call a ‘pick ‘em’ even money fight come the big night on May 2.

Our best tip at the moment: If you fancy Mayweather get someone to place your bet in Manilla. If you want to back Pacquiao, try Vegas.

An improvement in Pacquiao's sparring in the ring has seen 'smart money' gamblers backing him

Carl Froch – who was disgracefully accused of running scared of James DeGale – has added the most feared pound-for-pound puncher in the world to his list of potential opponents.

Gennady Golovkin, the killer Kazakh who knocks out opponents for fun, is in the Cobra’s line of fire if a fight cannot be made with Andre Ward at Nottingham Forest's football ground or Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas

Golovkin has made it clear he is willing to venture to Nottingham while also stepping up a division 

And just in case DeGale’s loose-tongued advisors would like to know, if all goes well for both of them this summer Froch would be open to fighting his fellow Brit thereafter.

DeGale meets Andre Dirrell in Chicago in May for the IBF title vacated by Froch, who beat the American in Nottingham.

Froch says: ‘James has not yet proved himself for a fight with me but if he can beat Dirrell it would become more interesting for me to face him. But not before a big name fight this summer.’

While Amir Khan and Kell Brook are talking about fighting any and every name in the welterweight division – except each other as far as Khan is concerned - world super-middleweight champion Froch holds an additional option not yet open to these of his countrymen.

Retirement.

That possibility may be a little more tempting following the offer of a bit part ‘as a villain or a tough guy’ in a gangster movie.

But he will not exercise the glove-hanging alternative – at 37 – if he can find ‘a fight which floats my boat.’

Ward has come into that category after the WBA ordered their two super-middleweight belt holders to meet for a second time to decide which of them is the real champion.

The American who calls himself Son of God became one of only two men to have beaten Froch when he won the final of the Super Six tournament – and the only one against whom the Cobra has not avenged a defeat.

Having been outpointed in that fight in the US, Froch is challenging Ward to come to the City Ground in Nottingham, saying: ‘We’ve boxed once in America so it’s his turn to come over here, where he will find I’m a different animal.’

Ward, a notoriously reluctant traveller, is making baulking noises about crossing the Atlantic even as Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn says: ‘We are in negotiations with his people.’

Chavez is committed to an interim fight next month, after which talks will resume for a fight in Las Vegas, the other venue which would realise a life-long ambition for Froch.

If neither Ward nor Chavez take the bait, world middleweight champion Golovkin has made clear his willingness to venture into Nottingham while also stepping up a division to super-middle.

Golovkin’s punching power has become fabled, while the eagerness of other top middleweights to duck him has become shameful.

Our own Martin Murray bravely met the challenge in Monaco last month. He was stopped for the first time in his career, victim of the 29th KO inflicted by Golovkin in a perfect record of 32 wins.

To which Froch has said to Hearn: ‘Everyone says he’s a big puncher. Do you think he hits hard enough to hurt me? Maybe we should find out.’

Froch is back in training and already only seven pounds over his 12-stone fighting weight.

Hearn says: ‘Carl’s crazy like that. Almost everyone else avoids Golovkin like poison but it’s the kind of challenge which excites Carl. Wow what a tough fight and I’m glad it wouldn’t be me getting in the ring with him. But we’re still talking with Ward and Chavez.

Froch is back in training and facing Golovkin would excite the 37-year-old, according to Eddie Hearn

‘Carl would consider DeGale if he wins the world title but that’s not an easy fight for James.’

Hearn adds: ‘Of course Carl could retire now. He’s worked hard and ducked no-one to get into this position. So he’s earned every right to make whatever decision he wants.’

That he most certainly has.
