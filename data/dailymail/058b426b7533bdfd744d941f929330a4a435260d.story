Nelson Mandela poses with his one-year-old great grandson in the first picture to be released of the former South African president in seven months.

Mr Mandela, 95, was captured relaxing with Zen Manaway, the youngest of his 14 grandchildren, at his home in Johannesburg, South Africa on Saturday February 2.

The picture will bring relief to millions of South Africans as there have been concerns for the great statesman's health.

The former president and hero of the anti-apartheid struggle had been forced to spend Christmas in hospital following an operation to remove gallstones.

He had to be airlifted from his rural village in the south of the country to the hospital for tests and was also been suffering from a recurrent lung infection.

Mandela, who is internationally admired for his struggle against minority white rule, retired from public life in 2004 after serving one term as South Africa's first black president.

He has married three times and has had six children, three of which have died. He currently has 17 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

Young Zen is now in the U.S. with his mother Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway and his aunt Swati Dlamini, as the sisters promote their new reality TV series 'Being Mandela' produced by COZI TV for NBC.

The 30-minute weekly show premieres on Sunday, Feb. 10 at 9 p.m. EST and will follow the next generation of Mandela family through the experiences of sisters Zaziwe and Swati and their families.
