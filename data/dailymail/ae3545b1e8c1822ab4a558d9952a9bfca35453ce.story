A British farmer has cultivated a 'tree of fire' that has yielded over 1,000 of the world's hottest chillies.

Joy Michaud, 55, has a glut of the 
Dorset Naga chillies on her hands and just one of the pungent red fruits is thought to contain more heat than eight vindaloo curries.

They measure an eye-watering 1.2 million units on the Scoville heat scale, compared to a mere 30,000 in the average red chilli.

Chilli out: Joy Michaud with a bowl of the Dorset Nagas. The chilli is grown from the Naga Morich, native to north-east India but given a British twist by Mrs Michaud on her farm in Sea Spring Seeds, Dorset

The Naga, originally native to north-east India rather than south-west England, usually has 800,000 Scoville units - the scale used to measure chilli heat.

But their heat has been turned up this year thanks to the red hot summer.

Mrs Michaud has now submitted an application to Guinness World Records.

She started growing the chillies in 2005 and sells the wickedly fiery treats at the local farmer's market - eight for three pounds to the bravest customers.

While handling the dangerous fruit the farmer two pairs of latex gloves and a plastic mackintosh to protect her skin from the heat.

She also advises that people wear goggles or glasses while preparing the chilli and to tie long hair back.

Just a small taste can cause burning eyes, a streaming nose, and uncontrollable hiccups.

Warning signs: The chillis come with there own caution, warning customers
of their ferocity while (right) Mrs Michaud smiles next to this years' bumper haul

Hope there are no holes in those gloves: Super hot chillis like Dorset Naga contains capsaicin which, although sweat-inducingly hot, actually relaxes blood vessels and can reduce blood pressure

Safety first: Farmers are forced to wear two layers of latex gloves while picking the fruit. Of course, a metal bowl is probably safer

Joy, 55, who originally hails from America, said: "It really is astonishing to think about how much heat is on this plant.

'It is holding more heat than any other I can think of. The most chillies we have ever had on a plant is about 700.

'I believe this plant has over 1,000 chillies on it so extra care will need to be taken when we pick all the fruit from it.

Small beginnings: The innocent looking seedling (right) will go on to produce chillis 120 times hotter than a jalepeno while Mrs Michaud (left) smiles next to one of the fully grown plants

'Not only that, but they are much hotter this year than ever before with an average reading of 1.2 million on the Scoville Heat Scale.

'This could be because of the warm summer as the hotter the weather, the hotter the chilli.

'The Dorset Naga chillies are so full of chemicals they can be quite dangerous, if their skin is intact they are ok, but if not, precautions must be taken.

'When I am picking or preparing them I wear two layers of latex gloves and I change them every 15 minutes as the chemicals will seep through and inflame the skin.

'I have applied to the Guinness World Records and am waiting to hear back from them.'

The Scoville scale is named after its creator Wilbur Scoville. His method, devised in 1912, is known as the Scoville Organoleptic Test. The higher the number, the more potent the chill:-
