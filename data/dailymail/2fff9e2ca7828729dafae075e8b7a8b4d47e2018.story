The father of one of the girls gang-raped and hanged from a tree says he was ridiculed by police when he reported her missing.

The man, who has not been identified, said that because he was from a lower caste, police officers 'refused to look for my girl'

The girls, cousins aged 14 and 16, were found hanging from a mango tree in Katra village in Uttar Pradesh after they were raped and killed by a gang. The case has once again shone the spotlight on India's attitude to gang rape.

Sheer horror: Two teenage girls were found hanging from a tree in Katra village in Uttar Pradesh after they were allegedly raped and killed by a gang of men - including at least one police officer

Hundreds
 of angry villagers crowded around the tree for the rest of the day, 
silently protesting alleged police inaction in the case.

Now the father of one of the girls has
 said that because of his low rank in the caste system, police ignored 
him when he went for help.

The
 family belongs to the Dalit community, also called 'untouchables' and 
considered the lowest rung in India's age-old caste system.

'When
 I went to the police station, the first thing I was asked was my 
caste,' he told the BBC. 'When I told them what my caste was, they 
started abusing me.'

At 
least three men, including one policeman, have been arrested in 
connection with the crime. Officials are searching for another three 
men, one of whom is also a police officer.

India
 tightened its anti-rape laws last year, making gang rape punishable by 
the death penalty, even in cases where the victim survives.

The
 new laws came after the fatal gang rape in 2012 of a 23-year-old woman on a 
moving bus in New Delhi that triggered nationwide protests.

Outrage: The attack is the latest of a string of appalling rape cases that have sent shockwaves through India in recent years sparking protests across the country

The
 endemic rape culture of India was brought to international attention in
 2012 by the shocking case of a woman who died after being gang raped in
 New Delhi.

The woman, a
 23-year-old intern, was attacked while riding a bus through the capital
 on 16 December 2012. She was set upon by a gang of six men - one of 
whom was under 18.

A 
court heard the woman was seized by the men, raped repeatedly and given 
horrific injuries after they had beaten a male friend who was with her 
with an iron bar, throwing him to the back of the bus.

The men were said to have been drinking heavily beforehand.

Details
 were also given of the horrific internal injuries the woman suffered - 
which were held up as proof they wanted to kill as well as rape her. She
 died in hospital on 29 December.

Ram
 Singh, 33, Mukesh Singh, 27, Vinay Sharma, 21, Pawan Gupta, 28, and 
Akshay Thakur, 20, were arrested for the crime. The youth was not named.

The
 six accused were taken into custody after the attack. Ram Singh hanged 
himself in prison, and the rest were found guilty of kidnap, rape, 
robbery and murder. The youth was given the maximum possible sentence of
 three years, while the remaining four men were given death sentences.

Rape
 remains a huge problem in India, and reports of the crime have been on 
the rise since the horrific incident on the bus. From January to October
 2013, 1,330 rapes were reported in Delhi and its suburbs, compared with
 706 for all of 2012, according to government figures.

In
 the wake of the incident the Indian government opened 73 'fast-track' 
courts in the hope of speeding up the rate at which rapes could be 
processed. It was planned that eventually 1,800 such courts would exist,
 and spend three years working through the backlog.

However,
 conviction rates remain low. Of the 706 rapes reported in 2012 in 
Delhi, only the most shocking and famous incident resulted in any 
convictions.

These are 
among 1,800 fast-track courts the authorities plan to set up and run for
 three years, focusing on violent crimes and other serious offences 
against women, children and the elderly, as part of broader judicial 
reforms, the report said.

Following the latest incident, it 
emerged today that the mother of a victim was stripped in the street and
 beaten by the accused's father for refusing to drop the case against 
his son.

The woman was set upon by Basant Yadav and four accomplices on Monday in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh.

Two weeks earlier, Yadav's son, Sunny, was arrested for allegedly breaking into the woman's house and raping her daughter.

The victim's mother has since led a 
campaign to have Sunny charged with the crime despite sustained pressure
 from his family to drop the case.

She is now lying in critical condition
 in hospital, rendered completely speechless since the attack. Still, no
 arrests have been made.

India's government continues to face fierce criticism over its handling of such cases and inability to eradicate sexual attacks on women and children.

And
 in a further horrifying case, the owner and manager of a children's 
boarding school in western India were arrested after five minors said 
they were raped, forced to watch pornographic films and act them out 
with one another.

The children were made to eat faeces as a punishment if they did not comply.

The
 52-year-old owner of the Chandraprabha Charitable Trust and his 
30-year-old female manager were arrested on Monday after a police raid 
on the school in Karjat city in Maharashtra state.

'We
 received a police complaint from the Childline charity saying that one 
child had gone home for the holidays and confessed to his mother that 
abuses were happening,' Karjat's Police Inspector R.R. Patil told the 
Thomson Reuters Foundation late on Thursday.

'Five
 children in total have now come forward and we have booked the two 
suspects under various offences,' he said, adding that these included 
unnatural sex (sodomy), wrongful confinement and sexual assault.

Inspection
 mechanisms for children's homes, shelters and schools are inadequate 
and many privately run facilities are not even registered, a February 
2013 report by Human Rights Watch said.

Records show a rape is committed every 22 minutes in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people.

Activists
 say that number is low because of an entrenched culture of tolerance 
for sexual violence, which leads many cases to go unreported.

Women
 are often pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual 
assault, experts say, and those who do report cases are often subjected 
to public ridicule or social stigma.

Last
 month, the head of Uttar Pradesh state's governing party, the 
regionally prominent Samajwadi Party, told an election rally that the 
party was opposed to the law calling for gang rapists to be executed.

'Boys will be boys,' Mulayam Singh Yadav said. 'They make mistakes.'
