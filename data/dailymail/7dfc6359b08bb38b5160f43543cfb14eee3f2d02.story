A student who ended up stuck in a tree after plummeting 3,000 feet when his parachute failed to open has spoken about his terrifying near-death experience.

Liam Byrne, 18, walked away with only a few cuts and bruises after he narrowly missed a church, a metal fence and other obstacles on his first-ever parachute jump.

The Northumbria University student said: 'It was my first jump ever - I don’t normally like heights.

‘It’s mad. I could have died.’

Near-death experience: Firefighters rescue Liam Byrne who landed in a tree after his parachutes failed to deploy properly

Mr Byrne, who is originally from Doncaster in South Yorkshire, had recently joined the Northumbria University Parachute Club and was jumping at the Peterlee Parachute Centre in County Durham.

He described how his first chute got entangled and then, after instructors used a radio to tell him to deploy his second chute, that got tangled up with the first.

He said: ‘Everything was going OK but then after the parachute came out, my hand got caught up in it.

‘I managed to free my hand but as I looked up, the strings had twisted around the main parachute.

To the rescue: The team of firefighters spent 45 minutes working to disentangle Liam Byrne

Stuck: The teenage parachutist narrowly missed a church, a metal fence and other obstacles on the way down before a tree broke his fall

‘I tried kicking out to get them to unravel but I just started spiralling out.’

Mr Byrne, who had completed just eight hours of training the day before, performed the emergency procedures and tried to get rid of the main parachute to no effect. 

He added: ‘Both parachutes were open but only one had inflated - and that is the one that was caught. There was no way I could do anything.

‘I couldn’t stop and started to spin again. I knew I had lost control.

Fortunate: Emergency services said Mr Byrne was lucky to survive such a fall

After falling 3,000 feet and getting stuck in a tree, he finally starts to descend after his terrifying ordeal

‘I had no idea how bad the landing was going to be as I didn’t know how low I was.

‘The parachute collapsed in on itself and I pulled myself towards a tree.

‘I was suspended up in a tree, and I was swinging towards the trunk.

‘I had no idea how big the tree was or whether it would be able to hold my weight.’

Ian Rosenvinge, a former soldier, who runs the Peterlee Parachute Centre said that Mr Byrne had done a six to eight hour training course before doing the jump.

He explained: 'We familiarise them with the exit position, which they practise a number of times.

'They need to be in an arched position so that they move away from the deploying parachute when they jump.

Miraculous: Despite falling a huge distance at speed, Mr Byrne managed to walk away with only a few cuts and bruises (pictured)

'Unfortunately Liam did not adopt the arched position.

'This happens from time to time when due to nerves, jumpers do not do it properly.

'When the parachute opened the lines became caught under Liam’s arm.

'On occasion parachutes can become 
tangled so we teach people how to disentangle - but unfortunately Liam 
did not realise that he was tangled.

'When people are struggling we have a cut off point where we have to get involved and do something about it.

'Over the radio we told him to deploy the reserve parachute.

'He did and the reserve worked fine.

'But the first parachute was still trapped under his arm.'

He added that Mr Byrne was unable to 
control the reserve chute because it had become tangled up in the first 
chute which was wrapped around his body and flapping in his face.

He said: 'Because two of the parachutes were open, even though one was tangled, Liam 
travelled slightly more slowly than he otherwise would have done.

'But speed was not the issue... The problem was he had no direction control.'

He added that Liam had probably been 
travelling at around 20 miles an hour when he landed.

Mr Byrne was left suspended 30ft above the ground until emergency services arrived to free him.

It took firefighters forty-five 
minutes to rescue him and when he finally touched ground, there was a 
round of applause from onlookers.

John Robson, from Country Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘He was fortunate, there’s no doubt about it.

'You’ve got everything from a church to fencing and all sorts of stuff round there. He was very fortunate.’

Safe and sound: The fire brigade and paramedics acted quickly after Liam's (pictured) fall

Mr Byrne was left with just a bruise under his arm and a scrape to his hand, which was caused by the tree he landed in.

His jump came just a day before Felix Baumgartner, 43, performed a 128,000ft jump from the top of the stratosphere to break the sound barrier, making it the highest and fastest skydive in history.

He said: ‘It’s pretty cool how this happened to me the same weekend that Felix broke the record.

‘I didn’t realise it at the time but when I watched his jump last night, I thought it was quite funny it was the day after I nearly died from parachuting from a much shorter distance!'

The life-defying experience has not deterred Mr Byrne from having another go at parachuting in the future.

He said: ‘I’m planning on going again, it’s the only way to do it I think or I’ll never get back up there.’
