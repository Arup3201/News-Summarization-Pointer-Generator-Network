A mother and son have died in their Orange, New Jersey home in a fire overnight.

Tanji Dewberry, 37, and her son Evan Ogando Soler, eight, were pronounced dead at the scene.

Neighbors and friends outside the home expressed shock over the loss of Dewberry, a vice president at the WL Ross investment firm on Wall Street in New York and a children’s author whose first book, 'Oh Fiddlesticks!' was published last year.

Tragic deaths: Tanji Dewberry and her son Evan Soler, eight, were killed when a fire ripped through their home last night

Police say the fire ripped through the home on Berkely Avenue around 11:30pm Sunday.

A passerby noticed smoke and flames emerging from the house and knocked on the front door to alert the residents, but upon receiving no response called 911.

'When we arrived, we found the building was completely sealed up and the companies forced the front door in and went inside to attack the fire,' Orange Fire Director Michael Down told CBS New York.

'Unfortunately, we found two victims.'

House fire: The house had broken window panes and burnt and blackened frames from the deadly fire

'Big heart': Neighbors say Evan Soler was 'full of joy' and would have a lemonade stand outside his home every summer

Bereft: Evan Soler's father Virgilio Soler was inconsolable outside the home where his son died

Investigators say an electrical fire in the boy's bedroom is likely to blame for the blaze.

Both bodies were found in the boy's room, and it is believed Dewberry was attempting to rescue her son when they both succumbed to the smoke.

Virgilio Soler, the child's father, did not live with Dewberry and their son, but was outside the home this morning speaking to investigators.

'I just feel empty, he was the world to me,' the heartbroken father told CBS New York. 'I don’t know if it’s something I’ll ever be able to overcome.'

Neighbors gathered outside the home this morning, shocked and devastated by the loss of the mother and son.

Devoted mom: Seen here with her son as an infant, Tanji Dewberry was known as a dedicated and loving mother

Accomplished: In addition to being a finance executive, Tanji Dewberry authored a children's book and had planned a follow-up this summer

'Mom was an outgoing mom, she did everything she could for this child,' neighbor Julie Antoine told CBS New York. 'He was outgoing, high honor student, very joyful. Had a beautiful heart.'

Dewberry was inspired by her son, who suffered from ADHD, to write her book, which aimed to help families and children to develop strategies to cope with the condition.

She had planned a follow-up book this summer and had been interviewed about her work on WLNY's morning show, 'Live From the Couch' to speak about it. During the interview, she explained that Evan was coping magnificently and was on the honor role and competed in the district spelling bee.

Neighbors said Evan Soler would have a lemonade stand in the neighborhood every summer, helped by his mother.

'Tanji was an absolutely amazing, driven beautiful person and a terrific mother to Evan,' Nyle Washington, a publicist who worked with Dewberry on the book told NJ.com. 'Her fierce love of her son showed in every page. I'm truly saddened by this news.'
