Britain is facing a £300million fine from the EU for failing to reduce  air pollution.

Strict targets to cut levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is mainly caused by traffic fumes, should have been met by January 2010.

But officials said Britain had not presented any plan to tackle the problem in 16 areas, including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow.

The Government now has two months to respond, and if it fails to present an acceptable plan it could face legal action and punitive fines.

The threat comes after the EU has already forced the Government to announce plans to cut the speed limit on parts of the M1 and M3 to 60mph in a bid to reduce pollution.

EU environment commissioner Janez Potocnik has previously singled Britain out for its ‘persistent’ breaches of the EU’s air quality  directive.

In a statement yesterday, a spokesman for the European Commission, which upholds EU directives, said: ‘Nitrogen dioxide is the main  precursor for ground-level ozone, causing major respiratory problems and leading to premature death. ‘City-dwellers are particularly exposed, as most nitrogen dioxide originates in traffic fumes.’

James Thornton, chief executive of environmental lawyers ClientEarth, which has led the charge against air pollution in Britain, said: ‘We have the right to breathe clean air and the Government has a legal duty to protect us from air pollution. The UK has some of the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide in Europe.’

The Government said it was acting to reduce pollution.

A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades.

‘Just like other member states, meeting the nitrogen dioxide limit values alongside busy roads has been a challenge.

‘That is why we are investing in transport measures to improve air quality around busy roads.’

In a statement last year, Mr Potocnik said that air pollution was the biggest cause of premature death in Europe. ‘It is an invisible killer and it prevents many people from living a fully active life,’ he said.

‘It already costs Europe £277billion to £789billion a year in extra health costs and prematurely killed over 100,000 people a year.’
