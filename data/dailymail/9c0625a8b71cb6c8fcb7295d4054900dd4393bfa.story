Wonderful moments  in life can come at the most unexpected times and in the most unexpected of places.

A homeless man, who had been living on the streets for 30 years, is the unlikely star of this video which has gone viral and has been watched by over one and a half million people.

The man known only as Ray is seen playing a poignant and beautiful song on the outdoor piano in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Dishevelled: Ho,meless man Ray looks dishevelled as Ms Polard approaches him

The video was captured after Roslyn Polard was passing by the piano in the city's Churchill Square when she was stopped in her tracks by the incredible music. 

Speaking to CBC News Ms Polard said she had to stop and turn around and go back, 'because it was so beautiful'.

Reluctant star: The homeless man appears a little shy to begin with but he soon enjoys the attention

Talent: Ms Polard had approached the homeless man after she overheard his spontaneous piano performance

Two videos which were earlier posted on YouTube  also show a man with a similar appearance to Ray playing various pianos around Edmonton in recent weeks.

The homeless man looks like he derives great enjoyment from playing the piano. 

'You could see his face light up every time somebody walked by,' Ms Polard said. 'And he was happy to have an audience, he was happy to have someone to chat with.'

The onlooker was worried her presence may have been invasive, however after she spoke with Ray she realised he was happy to have an audience.

Magical: Once Ray starts playing he demonstrates his impressive talent for playing the piano

Enjoyment: The homeless man looks like he is lost in his performance at one stage during the video

Pride: After the impromptu performance homeless man Ray tells Ms Polard that he wrote the song himself

'The music is beautiful. It really is,' she said. 'The juxtaposition of it — him sitting there and pouring his heart and soul into this song.'

'It was a completely spontaneous event,' she said. 'I feel very fortunate I was able to capture that.'

The video was uploaded by Ms Polard on October 23 and it has been so popular that she subsequently licensed it and she is now benefitting from advertisement revenue.

She has said she plans to find the homeless pianist and give him the money she has earned from the video.
