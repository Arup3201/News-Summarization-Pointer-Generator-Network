An Australian man looking to exact revenge on the worst car he has ever owned is offering-up the demolished product on Ebay.

Queenslander Ashton Wood, who set about on a mission to destroy his Jeep Cherokee earlier this year, has less than two months until he and some complete strangers smash it to smithereens.

After four years of fruitless car dealer and court negotiations, The Daily Mail revealed that Mr Wood had decided to take the less orthodox approach of smashing the $49,000 vehicle to pieces. Now, in another twist to his ambitious bid to send a message to Chrysler, he is selling the wrecked heap on Ebay.

Mr Ashton will film the whole demolition process and upload it online. An auger will start the demolition process by drilling a 'sunroof' into the top of the dodgy Jeep

There are plans to also set the car on fire - but Mr Ashton has assured it will be done in the safety of 4 hectares of private property

Once  Mr Ashton has destroyed the car - he will get rid of the scrap heap on Ebay

A hammer and crow bar will be among the tools used in the destruction of the Jeep

Listed under 'Cars, Passenger Vehicles' is the details of the very frank and forthright ad, which according to Mr Ashton, does not hide any nasty secrets - unlike the Sunshine Coast dealer who sold it to him.

'Destroy My Jeep - you're buying the wreck,' the ad says, with a description that reads: 'We are about to totally DESTROY our $49,000 2010 Jeep Cherokee Limited, as we refuse to pretend everything is OK and sell this onto someone else, so you are bidding on the wreck!'

Mr Wood is well into a second Kickstarter campaign to re-coup some of the cost of the $49,000 vehicle, after the first one failed to raise the $22,500 amount Chrysler offered to him to buyback the car.

He has since dropped the price to $18,500 and those who donate will have the chance to be involved in the car's destruction.

The ad continues: 'We intend on hitting it with hammers, shooting arrows into it, smashing out headlights, windows and mirrors.'

'Next comes the 34-tonne excavators that will have a drill attachment fitted to drill a 2-foot-wide 'sunroof' into the top and another large hole in the back to pin down the car, while another excavator fitted with a claw 'removes' the engine by tearing it out through the front grill.

People have 53 days to pledge their cash to smash the Jeep which has been the bane of Mr Ashton's existence ever since he drove it out of its Sunshine Coast dealership.

Once finished, the pieces will be sold-off on Ebay where the bidding for the scrap heap has already begun.

Mr Wood is hoping that people will pay for the fun of destroying his car, which he says is 'cursed' and a 'lemon'

So far there has been 57 bids for the demolished product and there have been 65 pledges for people to help him show the vehicle who is boss.

'I don't know who or why would want to bid on it ..  Maybe Chrysler are bidding for it and trying to bury it,' Mr Ashton told Daily Mail Australia.

He said there is a point to his particularly crazy idea.

'There's two things,' he said.

'I don't want to have to sell this car to somewhere else, because that's not fair, and I can't afford to just tear it apart and lose $28,000.'

He has already paid off about half the cost of the original price.

The other reason -  he hopes the demolition job will raise awareness to change consumer law in Australia and send a message to Chrysler about its dodgy dealings.

For $12 supporters can have their name written in permanent marker on the car before it is smashed up, $22 will buy someone a go at the car with a sledge hammer, $250 will enable someone to destroy the engine and $5,000 grants someone the right to set fire to the Jeep at the end of the process.

The car is now littered in signatures from the people who have pledged money. Everyone, providing it is within reason, will get to choose their weapon of choice.

Mr Ashton needs to raise another $13,000 in 53 days on Kickstarter before the Jeep gets demolished

Among the more outlandish requests to demolish the car include parking it on a rifle range and firing bullets at it, and using an auger to drill a hole through the car's roof.

The second request, Mr Ashton has accepted.

'It is a machinery company and they are providing the equipment to smash it,' he said.

'So we will begin with an auger drilling a hole through the roof of the car.'

Mr Wood insists he has never driven the car off-road and that it has only done 12,000km less than the average Four-Wheel-drive for its age.

Mr Wood said he is taking extreme measures after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010 has had all number of problems, including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking.

'Things happen with cars, but you shouldn't have 20 things wrong with it, requiring four tow trucks and a push [when the car broke down before he even got it out of the showroom],' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Wood said he 'tried everything possible the right way' to get a resolution from Chrysler, contacting the dealer, importer, Office of Fair Trading and the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal.

Mr Wood said he wanted to shoot the Jeep with guns but that's illegal in Australia and so people will have to settle for bow and arrow assaults on the vehicle

The Destroy My Jeep project was started after Mr Wood felt he had exhausted all formal options of communication with Chrysler

Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000, and he knows that if he sold the car himself he could get $28,000 for it, but he says he feels uncomfortable with both options.

'It's become a matter of principle for me, if I take their money, they're going to on-sell the car at a profit and someone's going to end up with my lemon and I just don't think that's right.

'I might as well try and find some lighter side to the whole thing.'

The Kickstarter campaign is a way of doing just that, as well as putting pressure on big companies who think they can bully unhappy customers into giving up, he said.

'I'm just really disappointed in their lack of want to resolve this issue and I certainly tried all the formal ways to resolve this.

'I guess in this day and age of social media it puts pressure on companies to do the right thing by their customers and I'm really hoping they review their policies.'

Mr Wood adds that he has 'never done anything like this before' and does not think all Jeeps are faulty.

'I don't think it's all Jeeps, it's just there's something systemically wrong with this one.'

Once the destruction of the Jeep has taken place, Mr Wood says he just wants to put this chapter behind him. He will have to buy a replacement car and while he is not certain which model he'll purchase he does know one thing.

'It won't be a Jeep.'
