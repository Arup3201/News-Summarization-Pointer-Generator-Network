Details have emerged of a regime of 'enforced happiness' at Pret A Manger, where staff earning little more than the minimum wage are monitored to ensure they are relentlessly cheerful behind the counter.

The bizarre 'emotional labour' rules mean employees of the popular sandwich chain are expected to be 'charming', to 'have presence', and to 'care about other people's happiness', and should never be 'moody', or 'just here for the money'.

Mystery shoppers visit branches every week to ensure all staff are displaying 'Pret perfect' behaviour.

While 'friendly' and tactile employees who high-five colleagues as encouragement and 'create a sense of fun' would be welcomed by the chain, Pret does not want to see a team-member who doesn't interact with others or 'minces words'.

The firm's chief executive, Clive Schee, has previously said that whenever he visits a Pret branch the first thing he checks is whether staff are touching one another, declaring: 'I can almost predict sales on body language alone'.

If staff at a Pret branch get a positive report after a visit from a mystery shopper, the whole team gets a bonus. But should the visitor encounter an employee who is insufficiently 'enthusiastic', or worse, 'bad-tempered', everybody misses out.

Details of the chain's list of 'Pret perfect' behaviours emerged online after an essay in theÂ London Review of Books exposed its reliance on 'affective' or emotional labour, a term used to describe work carried out with the aim of producing a - usually positive - emotional response in a person.

It flagged up the list of more than 50 'behaviours' drawn up by the chain as part of its efforts to ensure its staff make customers feel good when they visit a store.

It appears the list, which included 17 things Pret 'don't want to see', 18 they 'want to see', and 17 under the heading 'Pret perfect!', has since been taken down from the firm's website.

Pret said its guidelines are for internal use only.

A spokesman for Pret said: 'The reason guidelines are not published on the website is that they are for internal use for staff and the website is an external facing platform for communications with customers.'

Pret's policy also raised eyebrows in the U.S., where another blog post on Newrepublic.com said of the list: 'Pret doesn't merely want its employees to lend their minds and bodies; it wants their souls too.'

Pret came under scrutiny after an employee who was sacked from the branch at York Way, near St Pancras Station, towards the end of last year, for making homophobic comments towards a colleague. Andrej Stopa appealed, claiming the real reason he was fired was because he had spearheaded the establishment of an independent union for Pret workers.

'This member of staff was dismissed for bullying and homophobic behaviour,' said Pret spokesman Keith Beech.

'He went through the appeals process and it was decided in Pret's favour.'

Mr Beech pointed out that the independent union for Pret workers, Pamsu, had fewer than ten members, and added that employees were free to join any union they chose.

He said the practice of sending mystery shoppers to visit Pret branches was well-established.

'They send people to go into each shop and make sure that customers are being looked after,' he said.

He added that it was a way of giving Pret staff cash incentives to provide good customer service.
