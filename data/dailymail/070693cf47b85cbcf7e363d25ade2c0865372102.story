Police have thwarted what they called a 'catastrophic' plot by an expelled student to set off a bomb at his former high school.

Jared Cano, 17, had threatened to plant a device at Freedom High School in north Tampa and discharge it on the first day of school on Tuesday.

He was arrested last night after someone tipped off authorities about the meticulously planned plot.

At his home, police found materials to make pipe bombs, including a fuel source, shrapnel, plastic tubing and timing and fusing devices, Police Chief Jane Castor said.

Officers also found a journal containing schematic drawings of rooms inside the school and statements about his intent to kill - as well as a marijuana growing operation in his home.

He has written a detailed manifesto, outlining a minute by minute guide to his planned killing spree, police said.

He is also said to have written that he 'wanted to do something that was more spectacular than Columbine'.

Cano faces felony charges of possessing bomb-making materials, threatening to throw, project, place or discharge a destructive device, cultivating marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana.

Authorities said he has multiple juvenile arrests. Charges have included burglary, carrying a concealed weapon, altering serial numbers on a firearm and drug possession. All have been either dismissed or no action has been taken.

The St. Petersburg Times reported that prosecutors, at a hearing Wednesday morning, said that when Cano was arrested he repeated his plan to discharge a bomb and cause mass casualties at the school.

Cano is being held in secure detention.

'We were probably able to thwart a potentially catastrophic event the likes of which the city of Tampa has not seen and hopefully never will,' Castor told a news conference.

She said Cano, who had been expelled from the school, had hoped 'to cause more casualties than were suffered at Columbine' in his attack.

In April 1999, two students at the Columbine High School in Colorado killed 12 students and one teacher in one of the deadliest school massacres in U.S. history.
