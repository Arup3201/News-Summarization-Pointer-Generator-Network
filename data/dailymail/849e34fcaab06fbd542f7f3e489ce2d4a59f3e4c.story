A former Wall Street intern who left a top financial firm to pursur a career in porn has landed a six-figure adult movie deal just two weeks after quitting her job.

Veronica Vain, a.k.a. Paige Jennings, left Lazard Asset Management earlier this month after co-workers saw nude selfies she took in the office bathroom  online.

The 23-year-old has since been trying to kick start her career in the adult industry and has been offered the chance to star in a porn film called 'Screwing Wall Street'. 

She also admitted that since her change in career path, her boyfriend and mother have been very supportive.

Career path: Veronica Vain, a.k.a. Paige Jennings, (pictured at the Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas) has signed a six-figure deal to star in her first adult movie just two weeks after she left

Debut: The 23-year-old is set to start filming the first scenes of 'Screwing Wall Street' this weekend 

Vain would not reveal the name of who she was dating during an interview with Business Insider, but said he was Ivy-League educated and living in New York. 

'He's not the type of guy you would think would date a porn star. He's a normal guy with an office job.'

It will be parody of the 1987 movie Wall Street - which starred Michael Douglas - and will be produced in partnership with arrangementfinders.com.

Vain told the site it will be 'revolutionary and disruptive'. She also believes there is a huge market for 'sin products' such as non-traditional dating sites, lingerie and condoms and alcohol that mainstream marketing has rejected.

Vain made the headlines a fortnight ago after she revealed her boss told her not to come in because 'just about everyone had seen me half-naked online'.

Success: Since leaving the financial firm she has been trying to kick start her career in the adult industry and appeared on Inside Edition (right)

According to Business Insider, in June she started as a part-time intern in alternative-investments marketing at the group in Manhattan.  

The Florida University graduate insisted that when the selfies surfaced she was not fired and left her position willingly. 

She is to believed to have already handed in her two weeks notice when she started sneakily taking pictures in the toilets.  

Her Twitter description reads: 'I just left a job on Wall Street for a porn career because I can't stop masturbating at work.' 

Aim: Vain says the film, involving the founder of arrangementfinder.com will be 'revolutionary and disruptive'

She added: 'I left finance because if I'm going to take it ** *** *** for a decade, I'd prefer to get in to a hall of fame for it.'

Jennings is now looking to kick start her career and has made it into the final casting of the X-rated Internet reality show, 'The Sex Factor.'  

The porn competition which is set in Las Vegas and will be aired globally is scheduled to be hosted by Duke University porn star Belle Knox.

In an interview with Bro Bible, she said she did not expect her colleagues to see the explicit images because they were not attached to her name.

She said: 'Few people close to me knew what I was up to, but I firmly disbelieve they said anything, so I honestly have no idea how they came across it. So many people found out so fast, it is taking me for quite the spin.

On her decision to chose a new career path, she said: 'Intellectually speaking, I love financial analysis and thinking. 

'However, I found that I was not cut out for the politicking required to be successful, and sitting at a desk for eight or more hours a day really sucks the life out of you. 

'More poignantly, it seems that being openly sexually confident and respectable are mutually exclusive in the corporate world for a woman, and that seriously irritates me. 

'So I started exploring other options that weren't so stringent structurally. To quote Steve Jobs: 'You've got to find what you love'.'

'My boss's boss called me over the phone with a HR lady. I had a pretty good reputation intellectually, and this executive was aware of that. However, he obviously couldn't have me coming back to the office when likely just about everyone had seen me half naked online.'

She had previously worked as a stripper but did not think that it was a 'viable career path'. 

The Daily Mail Online has contacted Miss Jennings and Lazard Asset Management for comment.
