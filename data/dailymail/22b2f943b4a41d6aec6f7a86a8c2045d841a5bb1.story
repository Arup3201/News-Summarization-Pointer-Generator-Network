The mother of a 10-year-old boy who has been missing since 2010 has claimed that a search held at the weekend unearthed 'a lot of things and possibly evidence'.

Desiree Young said that she organized the search in Multnomah County, Oregon to look for any clues to the whereabouts of her son, Kyron Horman, who failed to turn up to classes more than three years ago.

She said that the two-day search, which was carried out by 60 volunteers, two non-profits and 10 search dogs, was successful but she would not be specific about exactly what they found, citing the ongoing criminal investigation.

The items were handed over to the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office and officers are now looking into whether they hold any significance to the case.

New clues? Desiree Young, left, speaks out during a new search for her missing son, Kyron Horman, right, at the weekend. She has said that the search possibly turned up new evidence in the hunt for the boy

'We're not going to find Kyron if we're not searching,' she told KPTV.

Kyron was seven-years-old when he went missing from Skyline School on June 4, 2010, and the spotlight fell on his stepmother Terri Horman, who was the last person to see him, but no arrests have been made in the case.

According to local news reports at 
the time of his disappearance, Horman took her stepson to a science fair
at the school that Friday morning and snapped a photo of him next to his entry.

Horman saw Kyron walking to his classroom before leaving, local police reports said.

But Kyron's teacher didn’t see him at the 10am start of class, and marked him as absent.

His
parents were alarmed when Kyron didn't get off the school bus that 
afternoon, and called the school which then called 911 to report
the boy missing.

Hunt: Around 60 volunteers and two nonprofits helped during the search on Saturday and Sunday

Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, sought a restraining order against Terri when sheriff’s investigators told Kaine that his wife had tried to hire someone to kill him in the months before Kyron disappeared.

Kyron's mother also filed a civil lawsuit against Terri, demanding she reveal where the boy or his body is, but it was dropped in July,

Young filed the $10 million suit against Terri Horman last year, alleging the stepmother kidnapped Kyron, but she dropped the case, saying it couldn't move forward without information the police won't release because of the ongoing criminal investigation into the boy's disappearance.

Despite dropped the case, she said she has never given up hope that he will be found alive.

'Every
day you are not here safe in my arms is another day of agonizing 
torture,' she said at a press conference in Portland in July. 'I will 
find you. It's all I want. I will not stop. I will never stop.'

Unanswered question: Terri Horman, left, the stepmother of Kyron was the last to see him and was named the 'prime suspect' by a judge in a civil case last August, which has now been dropped

Last seen: Kyron, pictured at a science fair on the morning of June 4, 2010, aged 7, was last seen by his stepmother walking off to class; this is the last known picture of him

Horman hasn't commented on Young's allegation, but the desperate mother urged her to cooperate.

'I'm still going to bring pressure on Terri. I'm not going away,' Young said.

Another twist in the case 
involves DeDe Spicher, a friend of Terri Horman who has testified before
the grand jury. Spicher's whereabouts were in question the day 
Kyron vanished.

After Kyron disappeared, authorities searched the condo Spicher was working at on June 4 and investigators also put out a flier with Spicher's photos on it, 
asking if anyone noticed her or Terri Horman between 9:45 a.m. and 1 
p.m. on June 4, 2010.

But 
Spicher refused to answer 142 questions related to his disappearance, 
pleading the Fifth Amendment and refusing to identify a picture of her friend, whether she knew her husband and if she had ever met Kyron.

Court
documents say she was at work but left abruptly at 11.30 a.m. and 
returned 90 minutes later. She has declined to say what she did during that 
time.

Ms Young has accused Horman of knowing what happened to her son, telling the East Idaho News: 'I believe that Terri Horman knows where Kyron is. I believe that Terri Horman is responsible for where my son is.'

She told Good Morning America in a 2010 interview that her son's disappearance was 'a parent's worst nightmare.'

She
said: 'We've racked our brains trying to think of reasons why. We 
cannot come up with anything. It's like a portal opened up in the school
and Kyron just vanished into it. It's a mystery.'

Investigators have long focused on Horman, although until this point, had not named her as a suspect or filed criminal charges.
