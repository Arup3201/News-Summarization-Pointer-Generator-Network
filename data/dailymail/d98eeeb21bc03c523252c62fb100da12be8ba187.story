Boss Harry Redknapp can call on striker Loic Remy however, the France international ready for action despite the failed medical that derailed his Liverpool move.

Provisional squad: Green, Cesar, Murphy, Hill, Dunne, Ferdinand, Onuoha, Caulker, Yun, Simpson, Traore, Isla, Henry, Barton, Mutch, Faurlin, Hoilett, Phillips, Wright-Phillips, Austin, Remy, Zamora.

Hull

Steve Bruce has no new injury concerns ahead of his side's Barclays Premier League opener against QPR at Loftus Road on Saturday.

Maynor Figueroa is back in contention after being given permission to miss the Tigers' Europa League openers in the wake of his World Cup exertions.

New man in: Tom Ince (centre) is expected to feature for Hull to make his Premier League debut for the club

New boys Tom Ince and Robert Snodgrass are both expected to figure as Bruce looks to shrug off the midweek loss of Shane Long to Southampton.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)  

Queens Park Rangers have taken just one point from six opening weekend matches in the Premier League (D1 L5).

In 10 matches, Steve Bruce has enjoyed just two victories on the opening weekend of a Premier League season (D4 L4).

This will be the first Barclays Premier League meeting between Queens Park Rangers and Hull City.

QPR’s last Premier League campaign (2012-13) saw them lose 5-0 at home on the opening day.

Slow starters: QPR have lost their last two Premier League opening games by heavy margins. Bolton defeated them 4-0 in 2011, while Michu scored twice for Swansea in a 5-0 win for the Jacks in 2012

Hull will open their Premier League season in London for the third successive time (after facing a London side at home in their debut campaign).

QPR Summer signing Rio Ferdinand last conceded a foul in the Premier League on New Year’s Day 2013. He has made 26 appearances in the competition without being penalised since.

QPR’s Loic Remy scored 14 Premier League goals in 26 appearances on loan at Newcastle last season.

Hull have conceded at least two goals in their last five Premier League games.

QPR have won just four of their last 39 Premier League games.

Hull have not won a Premier League game since securing their spot in the FA Cup final in April.
