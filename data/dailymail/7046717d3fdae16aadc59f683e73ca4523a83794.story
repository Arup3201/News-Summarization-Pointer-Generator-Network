Hundreds of Russian oligarchs are preparing to buy swathes of ultra-expensive property in London to protect their wealth against the country's crumbling economy, experts have said.

In the past few days six buyers have contacted luxury London agents Beauchamp Estates and requested £100million homes in upmarket Mayfair, Belgravia and Kensington in order to get their money out of Moscow.

In the past week Beauchamp has also seen a 10 per cent spike in requests from Russian buyers as panic about an economic collapse spread ahead of yesterday's currency plunge. 

The new wave of investors will further tighten Russia's grip on London's super-prime market, as they already buy one in five of the capital's most expensive properties.

Two days after the first Russian sanctions came into effect in April, Penthouse D was bought for £140million by an Eastern European, sparking speculation it was a Russian trying to secure their cash

The rouble went into free-fall yesterday as its value dropped by up to 20 per cent against the dollar, an all-time low, causing tech company Apple to suspend sales of its products online today. 

While ordinary Russian citizens flocked to Ikea today as the budget store warned of price rises, the country's super-elite trained their sights on the London property market.

Gary Hersham, managing director of Beauchamp Estates, said: 'The rouble has seen a massive collapse in value. 

'Wealthy Russians are desperate to get their money out of Moscow at present, and we have seen a 10 per cent upturn in Russian clients since the decline in value and the international sanctions biting into the Russian economy. 

'I currently have half a dozen Russian clients urgently looking to spend over £20million each on buying a new home in prime Central London.

'For them the address must be Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Mayfair and Regents Park, its got to be a prestigious postcode and ideally a park side or leafy address. 

'There has also been a rise in Russians looking at investment properties. Previously it was all end use real estate, but now they are starting to purchase rental investment property and commercial assets in large numbers, which has not been seen from them before.'

Alisher Usmanov, Britain's richest man who is worth an estimated £13.3billion, owns a £48million mansion in North London, bought with the profits from his vast steel and telecoms empire.

He also owns a 30 per cent stake in Arsenal footaball club, though he has previously complained about not having a seat on the board.

Len Blavanik, who amassed an estimated fortune of £11billion through Warner Music Group, owns a house on Kensington's billionaire's row.

The mansion, which has a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema and wine cellar underneath it, could be worth  £200million after it was refurbished last year.

Across the road from Blavanik lives Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, worth £9.3billion because of his interests in steel and oil.

He paid £90million for the home, which includes up to 14 bedrooms.

According to Adam Challis, head of residential at JLL,  between 200 and 300 Russian investors could flock to the capital in the next six months looking for an investment.

That number could have been far higher, but the British government's stance over Ukraine has driven buyers to Dubai and Cyprus instead, he added.

In May this year an Eastern European buyer was said to be behind the purchase of Penthouse D in Hyde Park which sold for record-breaking £140million, despite having no floors, walls or furniture 

The timing of the purchase, which went through two days after first round of European and U.S. sanctions against Russia were announced, sparked speculation that the buyer was looking to secure assets abroad.

Katya Zenkovich, from the Russian desk at Knight Frank, said that Russians began moving money to London early this summer as word spread of an impending financial collapse.

She added: 'For those that have started their search there is no indication they are abandoning their plans. Knight Frank web traffic shows the number of Russians looking at London property was 13 per cent higher in November 2014 than the same month last year. 

'The figure was 9.5 per cent up from October, a monthly rise that bucks a trend of previous years when traffic has slowed over the final quarter of the year.'

Figures released earlier this year showed that one in five of London's £10million-plus properties are bought by Russians, making them the largest group of foreign buyers, and only just behind Britons, who snap up one in three high-end homes.

According to agents Beauchamp Estates the customers are asking for apartments in large, hotel-style developments such as this one in Mayfair

Between 200 and 300 billionaire Russian buyers are expected to come to London in the next six months, according to property experts at JLL

In 2011, billionaire Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea football club, bought a £90million mansion on the country's most expensive street, a stone's throw from Kensington Palace.

His home in Kensington Palace Gardens, west London – known as Billionaires Row – has more than 15 bedrooms and extensive gardens.

While the Russian economy has been steadily declining since the start of the year, the current meltdown began yesterday after the country's central bank suddenly hiked interest rates.

The dramatic rise, from 10.7 per cent to 17 per cent, was supposed to help shore up the rouble but instead caused investors to panic, sending its value tumbling.

Officials at the bank said they have spent $2billion since Monday in an attempt to prop the currency up, which will add to the $78billion they have spent since the beginning of the year.

St John's Wood is among the other addresses being sought by Russians looking to get their wealth out of Moscow and into the safe haven of London

Along with a prestigious postcode, such as Knightsbridge (pictured) or Belgravia, the investors are demanding a park side or leafy address

As well as looking to store their cash in residential properties, large numbers of Russians are now looking for investment properties, which is unusual according to property experts
