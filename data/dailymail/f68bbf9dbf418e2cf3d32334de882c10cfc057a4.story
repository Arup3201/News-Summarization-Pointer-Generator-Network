Gabe Park was born with six fingers and toes on both hands and feet but has undergone surgery to correct the condition

A schoolboy who was born with six fingers and toes on both hands has undergone surgery to correct the condition - and is now hoping to join the RAF when he's older.

Gabe Park, 7, was born with polydactyly, meaning he had 24 digits in total and without surgery he could have faced major difficulties walking.

He inherited the genetic condition from his late father, Kevin, who also had the same number of extra fingers and toes in the same position.

Gabe, of Millom, Cumbria, underwent major operations when he was a baby to remove his extra digits - which were located between his thumb and first finger and between his big toe and second toe.

He can now walk and use his hands, but the condition left his feet far wider than average, meaning his mother Julie, 40, faces difficulty getting shoes which fit properly.

Every few months the youngster, who loves sports, has to be fitted with bespoke prescription shoes and attends appointments at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle to have his feet measured.

Mrs Park has been told her son may face more surgery in the future because his big toes are growing out from his feet rather than straight.

Gabe underwent his first surgery - to remove the extra finger from his left hand - in February 2006 and again in July 2006 to his right hand.

The youngster inherited the condition, known as polydactyly, from his late father Kevin, who also had the same number of extra fingers and toes in the same position

He then had both legs operated on in October 2007 and spent a month with his legs bandaged as he recovered. Without the operation his mobility could have been impaired as his extra toes could have affected his balance.

His mother said: 'The operations were partly for aesthetic reasons but doctors said the toes could grow over each other like when you cross your fingers and that could cause major problems.'

Mrs Park met husband Kevin in Kosovo in 2002 when she worked for the UN as an IT network administrator and he was seconded by the Ministry of Defence police.

She said: 'Kevin told me about how he’d had surgery when he was a young boy as he had extra fingers and toes, and when I became pregnant I knew my children could have with the same condition because it was genetic.

'When Gabe was born and we saw he was just like his dad, it made him even more special.'

Mr Park went on to work as a security consultant for the Foreign Office but was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2008 and passed away in May 2009.

Gabe wants become an RAF pilot when he grows up but could face more operations in the future to correct his feet as his toes grow outwards.

Mrs Park, a full-time mother, said: 'The doctor has advised he doesn’t have the next operation because it could affect his muscles and tendons. 

'However, the more time has passed, I worry that it could disable him further if his big toes continue to grow outwards and it might stop him of achieving his dream career. I've got to think of his future. '

She also has a three-year-old daughter, Maddie, who does not suffer from the condition. 

Polydactyly
affects about five babies in every 10,000. It may run in families - if 
both parents have it there's a one in two chance that their children 
will be affected. But it may also occur out of the blue.

Gabe has missed out on activities his friends enjoy,  such as playing outdoors at school, because he does not have waterproof shoes as they are not provided on the NHS.

His mother said: 'Due to his condition, his feet are much wider than normal and that means I can’t just buy shoes from the high street.

'He only ever has one pair of shoes at a time from the NHS, so we have to be careful they don’t get ruined.

'His school said he needs special waterproof shoes or wellies like all the other pupils to take part in the outdoor activities, but I haven’t been able to get any until now.

'We had to be careful about what we do, so if it was raining we couldn’t go for walks in case his shoes got damaged because it takes a long time to get them replaced.' 

But the youngster cam finally play with his friends in wet and wintry weather after he had a pair of 
special custom waterproof boots made.

After a generous donation by a well-wisher, she was able to have his pair of his old existing shoes modified to turn them into waterproof boots for £90.

He can now walk and use his hands, but the condition has left his feet far wider than average,meaning his mother Julie struggles to find shoes to fit him

But she has been told the next pair, which have to be made from scratch, will cost up to £1,500.  

She said: 'Every company I contacted to make the winter boots said they couldn’t do it. Some were saying it was impossible.

'I was eventually given 11 pages of contacts throughout the UK from the Independent Footwear Retail Association. Out of everyone I contacted only one said they would take my case on but it will cost between £1,000 - £1,500 for the next pair.

'The cost is just unbelievable and I also have to pay for travel for us both to go to the manufacturers in Potter’s Bar near London for the fitting.

'I made an appeal in our local paper towards the cost and someone donated £100 anonymously. I cried when I found out, it was so nice of them.

'I’m glad we could get him these waterproof shoes so he can join in at school, but they are so expensive and of course his feet will keep on growing so he will need new ones all the time.

'He can’t be the only person in the country facing this problem so I’m hoping people can come forward to help us find someone who can make them at a more affordable price.'
