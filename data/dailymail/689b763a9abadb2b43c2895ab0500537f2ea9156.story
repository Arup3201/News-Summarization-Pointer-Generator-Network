A mother whose baby died by hanging herself with a blind cord has vowed to carry on campaigning - after her charity was targeted by online trolls.

An inquest four months ago found Amanda O’Halloran's 17-month-old daughter Sophia died after accidentally getting her neck caught in the beaded loop and strangling herself in Gloucestershire.

But now, the 22-year-old is facing a stream of online comments blaming her for the death and calling her an 'unfit mother', after she started campaigning for a UK-wide ban on window blind cords.

Miss O’Halloran went public with her story to raise awareness of the dangers looped blind cords pose to children, but speaking out led to a stream of online comments blaming her for the death.

Writing on her Sophia’s Cause campaign page - which she started to fight for a UK-wide ban on the cords - the Cheltenham resident admitted the ill-informed remarks had left her feeling depressed.

Miss O’Halloran said: ‘I’ve been criticised a lot about Sophia’s Cause, people telling me that banning blinds with cords is pointless and that it is my fault Sophia died.

‘I’ve been blamed and called an unfit parent, neglectful and that people like me should not “breed”.’

Accidental: Miss O'Halloran had only left Sophia alone for a few minutes while going to the toilet - but the toddler put her head in the noose of the cord, slipped over and cut off her air supply

But she added that she has tried to stay positive, saying: ‘At first it broke me. I slipped into a deep depression and just wanted to be out of this world with my little girl.

‘At some point I decided to ignore the trolls. I realised that these people were in their few and 95 per cent of people have in fact been very kind and supportive.

‘I decided I wanted to make a difference and needed to do something, not just for my own sanity but for my little girl and for every child out there. So I started Sophia’s Cause.

‘I will persevere, I won’t stop. I will carry on creating awareness and Sophia’s Cause will live on in the memory of my beautiful Sophia. I love you baby girl.’

Only 17 months old: Sophia died on the morning of June 27 last year - and it would have taken as little as seven seconds for her to lose consciousness

In another post, Miss O’Halloran said: ‘Behind all of the campaigning is a grieving mummy, daddy and family. It’s so sad others have to spoil it and make it harder, it still hurts and it always will.

Tribute: Sophia's Cause was started in her honour

‘I’m just thankful we have so many more supporters than trolls - people who actually care and take the time to write lovely comments and share the campaign.’

Sophia died on the morning of June 27 last year - and it would have taken as little as seven seconds for her to lose consciousness.

Miss O’Halloran had only left Sophia alone for a few minutes while going to the toilet - but the toddler put her head in the noose of the cord, slipped over and tragically died.

The blind cord had been in the house since she and partner Chris Parslow, a builder, moved in 18 months earlier - hidden behind the curtain where it had gone unnoticed. Sophia - whose parents are expecting another baby girl in just over a month - is the 28th person known to have died in this way in Britain since 1999.

The Sophia’s Cause campaign includes a Facebook page and an online petition which could force a ban on window blind cords to be debated in Parliament if it gathers 100,000 names. The appeal has only attracted more than 5,000 signatures in support so far, and the parents have become involved in the first ever Family Safety Week.

Safety devices are sold with most blinds which include cleats to tie the cord to the wall, keeping it taut, and chain-break connectors which will pull apart when undue pressure is applied.

But they rely on the person fitting the blinds to make sure they are applied correctly.
