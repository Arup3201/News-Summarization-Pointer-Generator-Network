Teen idol Justin Bieber is related to fellow Canadian superstars Ryan Gosling, Avril Lavigne and Celine Dion, researchers a geneology website have revealed.

The celebrities' family ties date back around 400 years to some of Quebec's earliest settlers, according to Utah-based company Ancestry.com.

Bieber is Drive actor Gosling's 11th cousin once removed and Sk8ter Boi singer Lavigne's 12th cousin.

The three share common relatives in Mathurin 
Roy and Marguerite Bire, the researchers said.

The early settlers were born in France 
in the early 1600s, married in 1637, and moved to Quebec, where Roy 
worked as a master mason.

The genealogists also said Bieber and
Dion are 10th cousins three times removed because they're linked to 
French couple Jacques Vezina and Marie Boisdon, who were born in the 
early 1600s.

Michelle Ercanback a researcher with Ancestry.com said: 'The great thing about family history is that you never know what you're going to find.

'It was a very pleasant surprise.'

Ms Ercanback said researchers began tracing Bieber's family lineage about a year ago by paging through teen-idol magazines to find biographical titbits from the pop star.

Ercanback said she didn't know if these celebrity links are 'sufficient to point to the existence of a superstar gene.'

In July, Ancestry.com announced they had found that President Barack Obama could be the descendent of an African slave, after an examination of his white mother's family history.
