It may be worth almost half the price of the average UK house and have a top speed of 217mph, but the long arm of the law still managed to catch up with the driver of this supercar yesterday.

The orange Lamborghini Aventador, worth a staggering £400,000, was seized and towed away by police after they found that its driver's insurance policy didn't quite cover him to be behind its luxury wheel.

The car was without doubt the most expensive of more than 180 cars seized by police in east London as part of a crackdown on uninsured drivers.

And it is the latest in a batch of brightly coloured supercars to fall foul of the law of the capital's roads in recent months.

The orange supercar was initially stopped by officers in Newham as it had no front number plate, and further checks revealed the driver was not the registered owner.

The car - which does 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds and has an impressive top speed of 217mph - was seized as part of Operation Cubo yesterday when police discovered the driver had insufficient insurance to be driving the car.

Thirty-seven arrests were made for vehicle-related crime, including drink driving, driving without insurance and robbery.

Chief Superintendent Sultan Taylor of the Met’s safer transport command said: 'We work to keep the travelling public safe and part of our duty includes carrying out operations such as Cubo which help to keep uninsured and dangerous drivers off London’s roads.

The car is just one of a menagerie of especially flashy vehicles spotted on the capital's roads this summer.

But many of the cars' drivers have seen their pride and joy either slapped with a fine or impounded after parking illegally or not having the right paperwork to be driving the cars.

Dozens of supercars have been seized on an array of charges including driving without a proper number plate.

Another Lamborghini Aventador, this time a 'glow in the dark' model, was seized after its driver – believed to be a Qatari royal – was caught driving uninsured and without a licence.

It was later displayed outside Scotland Yard, covered with police tape reading 'uninsured vehicle seized by police'.

At the time a police spokesman said: 'We have had a few Porsches, BMW X5s, and a Ferrari – that one got crushed and in fact the vast majority of them are.'

Another £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador was pictured being towed away after the driver fell foul of the law - he was found to be driving without correct insurance.

And a member of Qatar's Al-Thani dynasty has had two supercars towed away by police.

The influx of foreign registered super cars to the UK was highlighted in a Channel 4 documentary earlier this year.

Viewers saw residents of the upmarket Knightsbridge area of London - home to Harrods - complain that their lives were being made a misery by super rich Arab playboy racers speeding around residential streets.

One resident described those with some of the more garish vehicles as 'a manifestation of too muchness'.

The capital's most affluent areas are often awash with super cars during the summer months, with the wealthy Arab elite escaping the searing heat of their own countries and embarking on a six week tour of Europe's top cities, including London.

Many of them bring their cars with them during the tour, known as The Season.

Last summer, five rare vehicles thought to be worth around £5million were spotted parked outside the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair.

It is believed that the cars all belonged to one Saudi businessman.

The fleet of incredible cars included two £1.5million Bugatti Veyrons, a £1million Koenigsegg Agera, a Rolls-Royce Phantom and a mat black Lamborghini Aventador.

A Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe in pink and an all yellow Ferrari S99 registered in Saudi have also been spotted cruising the capital's streets.

Perhaps one of the most garish cars spotted in London this year was a Ferrari 599, parked outside a designer store in Sloane Square.

The car was impressive enough - reaching top speeds of 205mph and 0 to 60mph in 3.7 seconds - but this one was wrapped in black velvet.

Some 11,576 vehicles have been seized during 22 one-day operations since the launch of Cubo in October 2012.
