Britain has been stripped of its power to return asylum seekers to Greece - after a ruling by European judges.

The decision by the Luxembourg court 
risks plunging the entire European asylum system into chaos - and 
leaving border controls in this country hamstrung.

An immigration watchdog warned the ruling would open a ‘perfect back door into Britain’.

Ruling: Britain and Ireland were today told they cannot send asylum seekers back to Greece because of the country¿s inadequate asylum arrangements

Under EU rules British officials can return asylum seekers to the first European country they set foot in.

But today the European Court of 
Justice said no-one should be returned to a country if it did not uphold
 their ‘fundamental rights’.

This means Britain cannot send asylum seekers back to Greece because its asylum system is such a mess.

The ruling also opens the door for claims against other countries on the grounds their asylum systems are not up to scratch.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch said: ‘This makes Greece the perfect back door into Britain.

‘In future, asylum seekers who are 
not, in fact, genuine will claim that they have come through Greece, 
whether or not they have.

‘It also undermines the agreement 
which provides for asylum seekers to be sent back to the first EU 
country in which they arrived.’

Around 90 per cent of illegal 
immigrants who arrive in Europe do so through Greece, placing enormous 
strain on the country’s immigration system.

The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg (pictured) ruled that no EU government can take it for granted that another member state¿s asylum procedures complied with fundamental rights

The court ruled on a case brought by 
an Afghan national known as ‘NS’ who was arrested in Greece in 2008 then
 expelled to Turkey. He escaped and travelled to the UK where he applied
 for asylum.

Britain ordered his return to Greece but he launched a legal challenge.

The court’s ruling said no EU 
government could take it for granted that another member state’s asylum 
procedures complied with fundamental rights.

The judges said: ‘An asylum seeker may
 not be transferred to a member state where he risks being subjected to 
inhuman treatment.’

As a result member states cannot send 
an asylum seeker back if they have ‘substantial grounds for believing 
that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of being subjected to 
inhuman or degrading treatment.’

Between 2006 and 2010, the UK removed 
6,034 people to other member states under the asylum rules - known as 
the Dublin Regulations.

Conservative MEP Timothy Kirkhope said it was time to ‘get tough’ with Greece.

‘Of course, it is not right that genuine asylum-seekers are returned to a country where they face further persecution’ he said.

‘However, there is also now a clear 
incentive for people with other motives to enter the EU via Greece, safe
 in the knowledge that other countries are powerless to return them.’

But Donna Covey, chief executive of the Refugee Council welcomed the ruling.

She said: ‘The responsibility to 
receive and determine claims of people seeking safety in Europe should 
be shared across the continent, particularly in Western European 
countries who see far fewer asylum seekers annually.

‘The focus for the member states must 
now be on improving asylum systems across Europe to ensure people are 
treated humanely while seeking safety in any country.’

Immigration minister Damian Green said: ‘Asylum claims should be dealt with in the first country of arrival.

‘We expect every member state to 
ensure that the Dublin Regulation can operate effectively across the EU,
 and we are working with Greece to improve their asylum processes.’
