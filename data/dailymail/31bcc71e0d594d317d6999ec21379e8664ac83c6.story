A restaurant diner made a cringing gaffe when she took a bite out of a $750 white Alba truffle that had been on display.

Despite the fact that the valuable fungi was under a glass dome in the entryway of Equinox in Washington, DC, it seems the unnamed woman confused the arrangement with a free sample offering.

The diner took a silver dollar-sized nibble before discarding the rest of the truffle on her bread plate.

Gaffe: A diner took a bite from one of these rare white Alba truffles after confusing the entryway display at Equinox restaurant in Washington, DC, with a free sample offering

Restaurant co-owner Ellen Kassoff Gray had put the truffles on display to celebrate a promotion that allowed customers to add truffle shavings to their vegan brunch for a $20 surcharge.

She says she only realized what had happened when she clocked the half-eaten truffle while walking across the dining room.

She told Daily Mail Online that she politely approached the diner, who was 'indignant about it. She hadn't a clue as to what a truffle really was!'

The diner even told Mrs Kassoff Gray that the taste of the truffle was not even to her liking.

The restaurateur salvaged the remaining truffle and took it to her chef husband, Todd Gray, with whom she co-owns the restaurant.

'I took it over to Todd and showed him, and he said, "That's a $300 bite!" she told the Washington Post.

Luckily for the unwitting customer, she was not charged for her mistake.

'It was one of the costs we had to eat, literally,' Mrs Kassoff Gray said.

Chef Gray, whose restaurant is a block from the White House and the first President Obama dined at after he was elected, told Daily Mail Online that the rare truffles are best served on silky pasta, eggs and wild mushrooms.

White Alba truffles are more valuable than black or summer truffles because they are rare and can only be harvested in October and November. Chefs value them for their unique flavor and creamy, marbled flesh.

Most are sourced from northern and central Italy though they can also be found in France, Croatia and Slovenia. 

Alba truffles are typically walnut-sized, yet can sell for up to $3,000 a pound. This month however, a record 4.16-pound truffle sold for $61,250 at Sotheby's in New York to a buyer from Taiwan.
