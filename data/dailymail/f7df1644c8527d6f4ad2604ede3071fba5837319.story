A teenage girl and a 20-year-old man who were discovered dead inside a car that left the road and crashed into a tree have been named locally.

Amy Clark, 17, and Rob Wiltshire were discovered inside the Ford Fiesta by a passing motorist near Charing Crematorium in Kent just after 10pm on Saturday.

Miss Clark, from the Ashford area, and Mr Wiltshire, from the Maidstone area, who was in the passenger seat, were pronounced dead at the scene.

One wrote: 'RIP Amy Clark and Rob Wiltshire. Far too young to die. God only takes the best.'

Another tweeted: 'RIP Amy Clark and Rob Wiltshire. Such a tragedy.'

And a third person wrote: 'Bad things always happen to those who don't deserve it.'

The Maidstone-bound carriageway was closed for around four hours while officers investigated the collision and recovered the car.
