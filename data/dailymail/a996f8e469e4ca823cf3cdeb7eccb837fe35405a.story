A teenage driver who had held his license for one day killed two 15-year-old female passengers after he crashed into a tree while going double the speed limit on a rural road.

Preston Maher, 16, had received his license the day before the October 5 crash in the city of Spokane Valley in eastern Washington, court records revealed today. Documents also showed the teenager may have been driving to 'get air' when the fatal crash took place.

KREM reports the 16-year-old is recovering from injuries and hasn't been charged. The case is being investigated as vehicular homicide.

Preston Maher had held his driving license for one day and was believed to be speeding when he crashed his car into the tree late at night

The teen was giving the two girls a ride from a birthday party on the Saturday night around 9pm.

Investigators believe he was driving 50mph in a 25mph zone when he lost control of his Infiniti Sedan and hit a tree along a section of road known as the Ponderosa Jump. The car struck the tree on the passenger's side.

The crash killed McKenzie Mott and Josie K. Freier, both University High School students.

Maher was taken to hospital in critical condition but later released. 

Alcohol or drugs do not appear to be a factor in the crash, investigators said and all three teens were wearing seatbelts.

Hundreds remembered the girls at a memorial service on October 6 at the school football field where friends and classmates described them as always having smiles on their faces.

Students, loved ones and members of the local community held white candles during a moment of silence for McKenzie and Josie.

Miss Freier's family asked that instead of flowers that toys be donated through local fire stations to Toys For Tots which was Josie's favorite. 

University High School Senior Khalil Williams told KHQ: 'There are going be a lot of sad people.
 I'm hoping we can all come together and try to focus on keeping their 
memory preserved, but it will definitely be hard, that is for sure.'
