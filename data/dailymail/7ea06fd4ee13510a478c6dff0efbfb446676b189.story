An Idaho man charged with slapping a toddler on a Minneapolis-to-Atlanta flight surrendered to federal authorities on Tuesday and was released on a $10,000 bond.

As a condition of his release, Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, was ordered not to drink alcohol or possess firearms. He also had to surrender his passport and he cannot travel outside Idaho, eastern Washington state, or the northern district of Georgia where the case will be tried.

Hundley is charged with simple assault for slapping the 19-month-old boy during a Feb. 8 flight.The boy's mother, 33-year-old Jessica Bennett, said that her son was crying as the plane began to descend into Atlanta when Hundley demanded that she 'shut that n****r baby up' and allegedly hit the toddler.

Accused: Joe Rickey Hundley is accused of first racially abusing, then physically assaulting 19-month old Jonah Bennett

Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land

Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that n****r baby up'

'I said, "What did you just say?" And he was so drunk that he fell onto my face and his mouth moved over to my ear and he said it directly into my ear,' She told ABC News:

But she couldn't have imagined what happened next, as Hundley allegedly slapped Jonah.

When I looked at Jonahâ€™s face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death.'

Mrs Bennett, of Minneapolis, Minnesota, says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since.

Hundley's lawyer Marcia Shein, told ABC News that no one should rush to judgment in her client's case, and he will be pleading not guilty.

Outrage: Mrs Bennett, pictured with Jonah, said that Hundley also informed her that her child was too big to be a 'lap baby'

But the task of proving his innocence may be difficult as Bennett family attorney John Thompson told the network that there were numerous witnesses who saw Hundley strike Jonah - including a federal air marshal.

If convicted, Hundley faces a maximum of one year in prison.

The 60-year-old, who is the president of an aircraft parts manufacturer based in
Idaho, denied slapping the child or using racial language. He claims 
that he did 'ask the mother to quiet the child.'

Hundley was suspended from his job as president of Unitech Composites and Structures, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Al Haase, president and chief 
executive of AGC Aerospace and Defense, Composites Group - Unitech's 
parent company - said the firm was taking the matter seriously.

'In accordance with our company's 
personal conduct policy, we have suspended the employee pending 
investigation,' Al Haase, president and CEO of AGC, said in a statement.

'We wish to emphasize that the behavior that
has been described is contradictory to our values, embarrassing and 
does not in any way reflect the patriotic character of the men and women
of diverse backgrounds who work tirelessly in our business,' Haase added.

The company later amended its statement adding that 'he is no longer with the company.'

AGC did not specify whether Hundley was fired or if he left voluntarily.

Hundley said he was traveling to Atlanta to visit a 
hospitalized relative, described his emotional state as 'distraught' and that he had one alcoholic drink on the aircraft.

However,
Bennett told The Smoking Gun that she believed Hundley was intoxicated.
The mother said that he 'reeked of alcohol', was 'stumbling around 
wasted' and he consumed several double vodkas during the flight.

Bennett says Hundley told her that Jonah was too big to be a 'lap baby.'

Agent Cheney added that Bennett 
received help from other passengers on the Delta flight.

Todd Wooten, 
who was seated 12 rows ahead, told authorities that he 'heard derogatory
language coming from the rear of the aircraft' and went to see what was
going on.

'According to Mr. Wooten,' Cheney wrote, 'he saw Joe Rickey Hundley strike' the child.

Hundley pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in a Virginia court in 
2007 after he was arrested following a quarrel with his girlfriend.

He was first charged with simple assault, carrying a concealed weapon, and public intoxication. Hundley told The Smoking Gun that the weapon he was allegedly carrying was a corkscrew.

Injuries: Mrs Bennett said she was 'scared to death when she saw that Jonah's eye was swollen

Situation: The mishap occurred on a Delta flight on February 8

Final approach: The aircraft was about to land at Atlanta airport, pictured, when the child started to cry
