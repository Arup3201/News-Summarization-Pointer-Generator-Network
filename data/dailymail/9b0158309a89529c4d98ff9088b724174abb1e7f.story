Eight members of the same British family fought in the First World War and miraculously lived to tell the tale. 

The Lord brothers from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, all escaped from battle with minor wounds and gas poisoning. 

So eager were they to serve their country, the youngest brother, who was just 14, borrowed his sibling's birth certificate to enlist.

William (left), Arthur (top left), Gilbert (top centre), Ted (top right), Frank (right), Jim (bottom left), Sidney (centre) and Len (bottom right) fought in the First World War and miraculously all survived 

Their service was acknowledged by King George V himself, who wrote to the men following the death of their army sergeant father. 

The monarch wrote to brothers Sidney, Gilbert, Ted, Will, Arthur, Frank, Len and Jim,  to say he was 'much gratified to hear of the manner in which they so readily responded to the Sovereign and their country.' 

Jansen Lord, the son of the third eldest brother Frank, said it was down only to sheer luck that all eight survived. 

'It really is remarkable when you look back through the history of the war that they did all survive. I think it is absolute pure luck none of them were killed.

'One of them was wounded in the leg and one of the others was slightly gassed - which actually caused his death a long time afterwards - but other than this they were all healthy.

'They never really spoke of the war but one thing my father did tell me is that he had a very close call one day.

The youngest brother, Ted Lord, was just 14 when he borrowed his brother's birth certificate to enlist 

The boys' father, Sgt Arthur Lord, was the last person in High Wycombe to be given a full military funeral (pictured)

'He was in the trenches and was very close to another Wycombe man who was shot and blinded.'

The eldest brother, Sidney Lord, had one of the most dangerous roles as a special reconnaissance officer in the Royal Naval Air Service. 

Once in an air balloon high above ground, he would have to try to identify the enemy base and determine whether or not they were attacking.

Jansen Lord, 92, said: 'My uncle told me that as soon as he was in the air the enemy would start shooting at him and he would have to shout "for God’s sake pull me down!"

'I do not think people realised at the time what they were going off to fight for.

'But it is great to see the start of the war being commemorated like it is.'

The soldiers' father, Sgt Arthur Lord, died during the war.

He had signed up years before the conflict and was the last person to receive a full military funeral and parade in their home town.
