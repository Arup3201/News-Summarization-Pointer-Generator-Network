The driver of a pickup truck that crashed into the side of a house in Salt Lake City acknowledged drinking 36 beers and doing cocaine before the accident.

No one was hurt in the early morning crash at a house on the city's west side.

However, the homeowner's dog was in the living room and received scratches as Bernabe Urcino-Saldago, 39, and his vehicle hurtled into the home just after 9am Monday morning.

No one was injured in the crash caused when Bernabe Urcino-Saldago, 39, allegedly drank 36 beers and did cocaine before missing a turn and driving into a neighbor's home

'If anyone had been up and around like we normally are during the day, chances are he probably would have run one of us over,' the family's son Mario Gutierrez said.

'I don't know how the dog survived. The dog's bed now has a couch and a coffee table on (it).' 

'I slapped him in the face three or four good times, as hard as I could. He woke up, looked at me briefly, mumbled something and then passed out again,' he told KSL, 

Gutierrez said he recognized Urcino-Saldago from the neighborhood when he saw the man over the steering wheel with his foot still on the gas pedal.

Gasoline was leaking from the truck into the family's living room. 

The driver, who smelled of alcohol, is thought to have missed a turn at the end of the street before crashing into the house and waking up its inhabitants with a bang.

The driver, who told officers what he had to drink after failing a field sobriety test, was arrested on suspicion of DUI, negligent collision and driving without a license

He said that he consumed two 18-packs of beer.  

A probable cause statement says Urcino-Saldago told police what he had consumed after he failed a field sobriety test early Monday.

The 39-year-old was arrested on suspicion of DUI, negligent collision and driving without a license.

Urcino-Saldago has a previous misdemeanor conviction for not having a license in 2010. He received probation.

The truck, which went through a small retaining wall outside, did not hit any load bearing walls, Salt Lake police detective Greg Wilking told the Deseret News.

Gutierrez and his family expect to be able to stay in the house. 

The vehicle also hit a tree.
