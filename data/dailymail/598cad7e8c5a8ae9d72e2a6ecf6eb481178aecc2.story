A fierce row has broken out between Stephen King and Maine Governor Paul LePage after the governor claimed that the author  doesn't pay state income taxes and has moved away from the state.

King immediately shot back that LePage should 'man up and apologize' for the comments because he still resides in Maine.

LePage's comments came during his weekly radio address when he argued that states without an income tax, like Florida, have lured away Maine residents, including King.

Fight: Novelist Stephen King says he still lives in Maine, and insists that Governor Paul LePage's claim that he has moved from the state is inaccurate

Statement: Governor Paul LePage said: 'Well, today former Governor Ken Curtis lives in Florida where there is zero income tax. Stephen King and Roxanne Quimby have moved away, as well'

House: Bangor resident Stephen King's house is pictured here, the best-selling author said he and his wife paid about $1.4 million in Maine state taxes in 2013 and likely paid about the same for 2014

He said: 'Meanwhile, remember who introduced the income tax here in Maine.

'Well, today former Governor Ken Curtis lives in Florida where there is zero income tax. Stephen King and Roxanne Quimby have moved away, as well.'

LePage's office withdrew the radio address Thursday, after learning that the  statement about King was false.

The corrected version, posted on the governor’s official website, deleted the reference to King and Quimby.

King spends winters in Florida but told the Portland Press Herald that he and his wife paid about $1.4 million in Maine state taxes in 2013 and likely paid about the same for 2014.

He told the Portland Press Herald: 'In 2013, my wife and I paid approximately $1.4 million in state taxes.

'As this is a matter of public record, I have no problem telling you that. I would imagine 2014 was about the same, but I do not have those figures.'

King has an estimated fortune of $400million from book publishing and movie rights, according to CelebrityNetWorth.com.

Tweet: King tweeted 'Governor Paul LePage implied that I don't pay my taxes. I do. Every cent. I think he needs to man up and apologize.'

Backtracking: LePage, right, withdrew the statement about King on Thursday after learning that it was false

The author's foundation awards $3 million to $5 million in grants annually, mostly in Maine. King, a best-selling author, has written over 55 successful horror novels.

However, the remark prompted King, a legal resident of Maine  to say the governor 'was full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green.'

King then tweeted Friday how much he paid the state in taxes over the last two years.  

The entire tax controversy stems from a plan being considered by the governor of Maine to overhaul tax.

According to the Portland Press Herald, the plan would reduce the state income tax by raising the sales tax and applying it to new items and services.

This, the Republican governor believes would encourage rich retirees and seasonal inhabitants to make Maine their primary domicile. 

However, the tax proposals have come under fierce criticism from Democrats in the state.
