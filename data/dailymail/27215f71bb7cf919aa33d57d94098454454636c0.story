A drug already approved to treat cancer could now help battle the ravages of dementia

A cancer drug could help ­protect brain cells from the effects of ­Alzheimer's disease, new research has found.

The breakthrough came as scientists discovered the toxic protein that was believed to cause dementia is not actually responsible.

It is actually a different protein that triggers the destruction of important connections in the brain, called neurons.

Researchers, from the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington found it is the tau protein that kills neurons in the brain when it malfunctions. 

The study's findings mean dementia can now be treated with nilotinib - a cancer drug already used by patients battling leukaemia.

The drug can help the brain's neurons clear the excessive 'garbage' that builds up. 

The research, which has been published in journal Molecular ­Neurodegeneration, found neurons are killed when the tau ­protein stops functioning. 

Dr Charbel Moussa, who led the research, said: 'When tau does not function, the cell cannot remove the garbage, which at that point includes Abeta as well as tangles of non-functioning tau, and the cell dies. 

'The Abeta released from the dead neuron then sticks to the plaque that had been forming.'  

Dr Moussa has long sought a way to force neurons to clean up their 'garbage'.

In this study, he shows that nilotinib can aid in that process. 

Dementia is caused when neurons in the brain die as a result of malfunctioning tau protein, which is supposed to clear the brain's build-up of 'garbage'. This can happen due to ageing or faulty genes 

But he added that while nilotinib helps the neuron clear garbage, but requires some functional tau.

He said: 'This drug can work if there is a higher percentage of good to bad tau in the cell.

'There are many diseases of dementia that have malfunctioning tau and no plaque accumulation, such as frontal temporal dementia linked to Parkinsonism 

'The common culprit is tau, so a drug that helps tau do its job may help protect against progression of these diseases.'

Tau can malfunction due to faulty genes or because of ageing. 

As ­people grow older, some tau can malfunction with enough normal tau remaining to help clear the garbage, therefore neurons are not killed.
