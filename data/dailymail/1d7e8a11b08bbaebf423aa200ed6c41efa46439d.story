A new study claims that young adults who care for an animal have stronger social relationships

Plenty of children pester their parents for a puppy or kitten.

And now it might be harder for parents to refuse their pleas as a new study claims that young adults who care for an animal have stronger social relationships.

U.S. scientists also found that looking after a pet might also boost teenagers’ connections to their communities as well.

Animals are used in therapeutic settings where they can have positive effects on children, but little is known about the benefits everyday interactions with animals can bring to young people.

‘Our findings suggest that it may not be whether an animal is present in an individual’s life that is most significant but rather the quality of that relationship,’ said Dr Megan Mueller, a developmental psychologist and research assistant professor at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, Massachusetts, who co-authored the study.

‘The young adults in the study who had strong attachment to pets reported feeling more connected to their communities and relationships,’ she said.

Dr Mueller surveyed more than 500 participants aged between 18 and 26 about their attitudes and interaction with animals, for the study which was published in online journal Applied Developmental Science.

Their responses were compared to their answers to questions designed to measure positive youth development characteristics such as competence, caring, confidence, connection, and character, as well as feelings of depression.

The study found that young adults who cared for animals reported engaging in more ‘contribution’ activities, such as providing service to their community, helping friends or family and demonstrating leadership, than those who did not look after a pet.

The more actively they participated in the pet’s care, the higher they scored on their sociable deeds.

The study also found that high levels of attachment to an animal in late adolescence and young adulthood were positively associated with feeling connected with other people, having empathy and feeling confident.

‘We can’t draw causal links with this study but it is a promising starting point to better understanding the role of animals in our lives, especially when we are young,’ said Dr Mueller.

To further the research, scientists need to look at how specific features of human experiences are connected with animal experiences, as well as how these relationships develop over time, and look at a larger, more diverse sample of people.
