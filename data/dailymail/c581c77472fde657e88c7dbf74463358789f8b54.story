Jasem Emwazi has been told to publicly distance himself from his son or leave Kuwait 

Kuwaiti MPs yesterday called on Jihadi John’s father, Jasem Emwazi, to publicly distance himself from his son’s actions by apologising – or leave the country.

Kuwaitis have become increasingly frustrated with the mixed messages coming from 51-year-old British citizen Mr Emwazi, whose family are said to have cost the British tax-payer up to £400,000 in the 20 years they have lived in the UK.

Last week, Mr Emwazi told former workmates his son was a ‘dog’ and hoped he would die, yet a few days later, his lawyer in Kuwait suggested there was ‘no proof’ the masked IS executioner-in-chief was in fact 26-year-old Mohammed.

Yesterday, Abdullah Yousef Al-Maayouf, a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly and chairman of the country’s Parliamentary interior and defence committee, called for Mr Emwazi to apologise or leave.

He said: ‘Kuwait is a safe, peaceful country and does not want to be associated with Mohammed Emwazi. What he has done is not his family’s fault, but they should apologise on his behalf and say they do not agree with it.

‘If they will not say this publicly, they should leave Kuwait.’

Mr Emwazi is believed to have been living in Kuwait with his eldest daughter Asma, 25, for the last two years while his wife Ghaneya and four other children remained in London – now guarded by armed police in a hotel.

Westminster council is reportedly still paying the rent on the family’s £600,000 flat even though the rules say housing benefit should normally be stopped after 13 weeks. 

As members of the stateless Bedoon ethnic group, the Emwazis were granted asylum in the UK, claiming to have fled Kuwait in fear of persecution.

Former Kuwaiti MP Safa Al Hashem urged Mr Emwazi to ‘speak openly’ about his son and apologise.

‘From what we read, he has said one thing to his friends at work, then another in public,’ she said. ‘Whether an apology from him would be accepted by people is not certain, but he should make one anyway.

‘I think it would be better if he went back to the UK and spoke to the police and security services there about what he knows.’

Meanwhile, Kuwaiti government adviser and security expert Dr Fahed Al-Shelaimi, a retired army colonel, said he believed Mr Emwazi would return to the UK within days.

Mr Emwazi has both described his 26-year-old son (above) as a 'dog' and claimed there is no evidence to prove he is the hooded killer shown in ISIS films 

‘Kuwait wants to distance itself from Mohammed Emwazi and officials here consider it a largely British issue. He was born here but brought up in London.

‘His father’s presence in Kuwait is embarrassing for the country. The Kuwaiti government doesn’t want the headache, so will ask him gently to leave the country.

‘Jasem has already quit his job, and people are cursing his son – I doubt he will be able to stand the heat and I expect he will leave soon. In 90 per cent of cases when people are asked to leave here, they go quietly.’

Neither Jasem Emwazi or his lawyer, Salem Al-Hashash, were available for comment yesterday.
