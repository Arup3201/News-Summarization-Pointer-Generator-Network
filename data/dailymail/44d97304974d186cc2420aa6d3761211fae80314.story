Serial pest Peter Hore has been banned from attending the G20 summit in Brisbane after years of stirring up trouble and disrupting public events.

The 54-year-old from Newcastle, north of Sydney, is one of just two people on the G20's Prohibited List and will not be allowed in Brisbane from November 8-17.

Mr Hore had revealed he wanted to walk naked across Brisbane's Gateway Bridge when the world's leaders descended on the city this week, the Courier Mail reports.

But he claims he wouldn't have carried out the plan anyway because of an outstanding arrest warrant that could land him in jail.   

'I'd be put straight into police custody if I went back,' he said.

'I'd be held on remand on a 2008 charge of resisting arrest, and probably be denied bail and spend two or three months in custody. Why would I go back?'

NSW Police approached Mr Hore on Friday while he was busking in Newcastle to hand him a letter signed by Queensland's Commissioner of Police saying he wasn't welcome at the G20.

He was also given a map outlining the specific zones he has been banned from.

The now 54-year-old has a long history of interrupting public events. He was taken away by police in Brisbane in 2006 for disrupting a lingerie launch hosting by supermodel Sarah Murdoch

He carried cats and rode a tricycle onto the field ahead of the Newcastle Knights and Parramatta NRL game in 2006

'I think I should frame the letter, considering it's signed by Queensland's Commissioner of Police,' he said.

Mr Hore has a long history of causing trouble and protesting.

He infamously ran onto the racetrack at Flemington during the 1997 Melbourne Cup and invaded the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the same year to ruin Australia's hopes of qualifying for the World Cup against Iran.

Australia had been leading 2-0 at the time, but after the disruption Iran scored two quick goals to level the score and knock Australia out of contention for the 1998 World Cup. 

The 54-year-old also made appearances at the funerals of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence and racing legend T J Smith.

Just this year, Mr Hore stormed a corruption hearing at Sydney's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC).

A police officer reportedly suffered a bad cut to the head after he struck it on a table trying to subdue him.

Mr Hore was charged in 2002 with assisting asylum seekers to escape from the Woomera Detention Centre

Dubbed the serial pest, Mr Hore said he wasn't aware of any planned protests at the G20 and claims he has given up protesting 

'It is all very well him courting media attention and doing things like he [allegedly] did at ICAC where a security officer was seriously injured,' Detective Superintendent Darren Bennett told the Newcastle Herald at the time. 

'The bloke is an imbecile and should not be treated as anything but a criminal.'

Mr Hore was also arrested in April boarding a train from Melbourne to Sydney after announcing he planned to interrupt the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their royal tour of Australia. 

He said his protesting days were over and had since turned his hand to art.
