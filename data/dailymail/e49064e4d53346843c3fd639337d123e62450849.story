Summer may have officially arrived, but not at Lake Superior.

A Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources warden discovered some icebergs still afloat in Lake Superior near Madeline Island.

Amie Egstad spotted the floating ice – which was covered in resting seagulls – while doing a routine check of commercial nets in the largest of the Great Lakes.

The sight was at odds with data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at the weekend, which declared all of the Great Lakes ice-free.

The announcement broke an unprecedented seven months of ice coverage, according to Policy Mic.

Yep, still frozen: Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources warden Amie Egstad took photos of icebergs floating Lake Superior, near Madeline Island. The Great Lakes were declared ice free on June 7

The lakes normally thaw by the first week of May, but the harsh winter and polar vortex has stalled that, making this a record-breaking year

Making the most of it: Despite temperatures sitting around 70 and 80 degrees, the ice on Lake Superior has failed to completely thaw. Here some young people play foosball on one of the icebergs, in a photo posted to Facebook on May 31

According to a National Geographic report, the summer temperatures of the Great Lakes are expected to be colder this year because more than 90 percent of the lakes had been covered in ice during this past winter

The lakes normally thaw by the first week of May.

However, due to the harsh winter that gripped most of America this year and the polar vortex, the ice lasted into June.

In March, the Great Lakes were 92.5 percent frozen.

NOAA reported that the ice has never lasted this late in the year, based on their data.

'We saw the ice as early as November 25 and now into June,' NOAA scientist George Leshkevich told the Washington Post.

'In terms of duration I would think it's up there, if not at the top of the chart [in the historic record].'

Mr Egstad said he was shocked to still see icebergs, considering temperatures in the area sitting around 70 degrees.

But the temperatures are not strong enough to melt the ice.

'There was this big iceberg along with other ice packs and bergs floating around backside of Madeline Island area east towards Saxon Harbor,' Mr Egstad told CBS Minnesota.

All of the Great Lakes, including Lake Superior,were declared ice free on June 7, marking the end of a record breaking seven month stretch 
where the lakes were covered in at least one ice cube

The water temperatures of the Great Lakes will be significantly colder this summer.

Earlier this year Nasa revealed that even
 though North America was a full month into astronomical spring, the 
Great Lakes have been slow to give up on the harsh winter.

The space agency published a stunning picture of the Great Lakes, showing a third of their expanse is still covered in ice.

Lake Superior was found to be the most affected, and was found to be 63.5 percent ice covered on April 20th.

The stunning image was taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite.

It captured a unique natural-color image of Lake Superior, which straddles the United States–Canada border.

At
 the time Aqua passed over, the lake was 63.5 percent ice covered, 
according to the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab (GLERL).

On April 20, 2014, NASA's Aqua satellite 
captured this natural-color image of Lake Superior, which straddles the 
United States/Canada border. At the time Aqua passed over, the lake was a
 record 63.5 percent ice covered. Averaged across Lake Superior, ice was
 22.6 centimeters (8.9 inches) thick; it was as much as twice that 
thickness in some locations

Averaged across Lake Superior, ice was 
22.6 centimeters (8.9 inches) thick; it was as much as twice that 
thickness in some locations.

For 
comparison, Lake Superior had 3.6 percent ice cover on April 20, 2013; 
in 2012, ice was completely gone by April 12.

In the last winter that 
ice cover grew so thick on Lake Superior (2009), it reached 93.7 percent
 on March 2 but was down to 6.7 percent by April 21.

Average
 water temperatures on all of the Great Lakes have been rising over the 
past 30 to 40 years and ice cover has generally been shrinking. (Lake 
Superior ice was down about 79 percent since the 1970s.)

But
 chilled by persistent polar air masses throughout the 2013-14 winter, 
ice cover reached 88.4 percent on February 13 and 92.2 percent on March 
6, 2014, the second highest level in four decades of record-keeping.

As many as 70 ships have been backed up in Lakes
 Michigan, Huron, and Erie, waiting for passage into ports on Lake 
Superior. Though North America is a full month into astronomical spring,
 the Great Lakes have been slow to give up on winter. As of April 22, 
2014, the Great Lakes were 33.9 percent ice covered. The lake they call 
Superior dominated the pack

Lake 
Superior ice cover got as high as 95.3 percent on March 19. By April 22,
 it was reported at 59.9 percent; Lake Huron was nearly 30.4 percent.

News outlets noted that as many as 70 ships have been backed up in Lakes
 Michigan, Huron, and Erie, waiting for passage into ports on Lake 
Superior.

The
 U.S. Coast Guard has been grouping ships together into small convoys 
after they pass through locks at Sault Ste.

Marie, in order to maximize 
ice-breaking efficiency and to protect ships from damage.

Superior
 is the world’s largest freshwater lake by area (82,100 square 
kilometers or 31,700 square miles) and the third largest by volume.
