So close yet so far from the parties of Patong on Thailand's biggest island, developers hope a new hotel in Phuket will be the epitome of serenity.

Keemala is a small wellness-focused resort in the woodlands just outside the village and beach of Kamala, on the west coast of the island, and is set for a September 2015 opening.

Small Luxury Hotels of the World says the tranquil setting of the resort will 'encourage guests to rebalance, rejuvenate and relax' among the trees, streams and waterfalls seamlessly added to enhance the natural landscape.

While all villas have access to a private  pool, Keemala also has a communal pool at its centre for relaxing with fellow guests

The resort's 38 pool villas come in in four separate styles - clay and straw cottages, tent villas, tree houses and bird's nest villas - with each one representing a clan of fictitious early Phuket settlers.

The hotel said: ‘The architecture of the four different villa types reflects the skills and way of life of each of the groups.

‘Keemala and its grounds are designed as an expansion of the surrounding landscape, making use of natural features such as mature trees, streams and waterfalls and integrating these into the overall design and creating a wonderland for guests to enjoy.’

Each of the villas comes with a private pool and outdoor terrace, while a communal pool  forms the centrepiece of the resort around which all revolves.

Natural building materials combine with sleek, modern designs in the area which will greet those who stay at Keemala

With health and well-being the heart and soul of the project, this is the wellness spa among the trees for guests

According to the hotel, 16 clay cottages reflect the earthiness of the Pa-ta-pea clan, which believed in a strong connection to the Earth and were leaders in agriculture.

Seven tent villas are inspired by the nomadic Khon-Jorn tribe of wanderers who excelled in hunting and trading.

The hotel also boasts seven treehouses inspired by the We-ha clan, whose people worshipped the university and lived in trees to be closer to the sky.

Keemala’s bird nest villas reflect the opulent lifestyle – compared to other clans, at least – led by the Rung-Nok people. The interwoven design of their homes helped with protection and privacy. 

The bauble-shaped treehouses, one of four types of dwelling, loosely resemble James Cameron's Pandora from the blockbuster film Avatar

The versatile design makes guests in the treehouse feel part of the environment with the balcony jutting out into the trees

The exterior of each treehouse villa is mirrored by the bespoke cane furniture and tribal-style artwork on the inside 

The treehouse's bathroom has the all-natural feeling of being inside a tree, with wooden stumps even forming the casing for the dual sinks

With wellness high on the agenda, a spa offers organic and traditional treatments, while there is also a gym, yoga pavilions and areas devoted to meditation for those keen to dictate their own fitness and health schedule. 

The in-house restaurant will feature 'wholesome cuisine' along with fine dining and there are also quaint spots around the resort for destination dining - ideal for private parties, romantic picnics and cooking classes.

Keemala is like no other resort on Phuket Island, due to its architecture and experiences offered, making it an ideal addition to the  collection.

Communal areas are designed as open spaces that offer spectacular views of lush forest and invite the sounds of nature.

Aiming to offer experiences that are ‘beyond enchanting’, Keemala is like no other resort on Phuket Island, due to its architecture and experiences offered, making it an ideal addition to the collection.

While embracing traditional Thai culture and customs, the hotel bills itself as a five-star sanctuary for those who wish to rebalance, rejuvenate and relax in a serene rainforest. 

At the opposite end of the spectrum from their Avatar-like treehouses, the clay and straw cottages channel the homes of The Hobbit

Despite its seemingly isolated setting Keemala is just a five-minute drive from Kamala beach and a ten-minute drive from the lively Patong, Phuket’s main tourist resort and a hotspot for nightlife.

The nearest international airport is 40 minutes away.
