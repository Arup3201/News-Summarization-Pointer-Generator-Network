President Barack Obama has admitted that global crises such as Ebola, ISIS and Russian aggression have made the world spin so fast, nobody is able to control it.

The president made the remarks at a Democratic National Convention fund-raiser in New York City yesterday but added that America is proud to bear the brunt of these problems.

His comments come as the U.S. continue airstrikes on ISIS militants in Syria and Iraq and California congressman Duncan Hunter claims 'at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas'.

Just yesterday General Martin Dempsey, who chairs the military Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the US and its allies were finding it more and more difficult to track the increasingly technologically adept ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria.

Meanwhile the president is also facing the threat of the deadly Ebola virus on US soil as fears of the spread of the condition continue to grow. 

Thomas Duncan from San Angelo, Texas became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States after recently travelling to Liberia and is currently receiving treatment in a Dallas hospital.   

It was also announced yesterday that $750million would be spent so the US military can construct treatment facilities in Ebola stricken countries.

This prompted the president to tell fellow Democrats gathered at the White Street Restaurant that times are uncertain due to all the changes taking place across the globe.

The presidents comments on ISIS come after the U.S. continued airstrikes against suspected militants in Syria and Iraq 

The president added that is was the U.S. who first mobilized a coalition to stand up to ISIS. Pictured are suspected Islamic State militants raise their flag on a hill near the Syrian town of Kobane 

According to a Weekly Standard blog, he said: 'Understandably, when you see the headlines every single day and you read about ISIS and Ebola and the Russian incursions into Ukraine, there’s a sense possibly that the world is spinning so fast and nobody is able to control it.'

However, he followed up his claim by saying that it was it was the United States who are leading the way in trying to respond to these problems.

He told of how it was America that mobilized a coalition to take a stand against ISIS in the Middle East and that they are also at the forefront of improving health infrastructure in Ebola stricken West Africa.

Mr Obama also alluded to the Ukraine conflict saying it was the United States, who encouraged the world community to take a stand against Russian aggression.

It comes as after claims pro-Russian separatists used tanks, artillery systems and rocket launchers in their fight to capture the airport in the rebel-held Ukrainian city of Donetsk yesterday.

Mr Obama added: 'But in the end, it's a burden that we bear proudly because it's part of what makes us American, and it's part of what that lady with the torch in the middle of the water means.

'It's part of what attracts people from every corner of the globe to this country, understanding that for all our flaws there’s something essential that we stand for that nobody else does, and we're willing to put our money and time and effort and resources and occasionally our lives on behalf of that.'

The president's speech comes as some Americans have become disillusioned with the president's response to global issues.

Meanwhile it was only earlier this week that the president made his first public comments on Ebola when he explained that the government had an 'all-hands-on-deck approach' to stopping a pandemic, but insisted that 'the chances of an outbreak, of an epidemic here are extraordinarily low.'
