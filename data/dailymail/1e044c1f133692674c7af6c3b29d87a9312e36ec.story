Nancy Cameron ‘threatened to go on hunger strike’ unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored as Top Gear host, her father joked yesterday.

David Cameron said his 11-year-old daughter was campaigning against the BBC’s decision to suspend the presenter over a ‘fracas’ with a producer.

Mr Clarkson is an Oxfordshire neighbour and family friend of the Camerons.

David Cameron's daughter Nancy, 11, ‘threatened to go on hunger strike’ unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored as Top Gear host

Despite the 'threat', which her parents have joked about, Nancy appeared to be enjoying dinner with her family

The PM told the BBC: ‘Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored.

‘I’ve told her this is not necessarily a useful intervention. It’s not exactly Gandhi, we had a discussion about this this morning.’

Samantha Cameron chipped in: ‘Nancy’s hunger strike this morning lasted approximately five minutes’.

The Prime Minister quipped: ‘It’s between lunch and tea is the way it works.’

During the interview, Mr Cameron and BBC Political Editor James Landale went to a local butcher near his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire.

They then went back to Mr Cameron’s home where the PM was interviewed while preparing food in his kitchen.

Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (right), prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air

Mr Cameron was seen visiting a butchers shop in his Witney constituency, and joking about 'juicy thighs'

In the shop, Mr Cameron chose some chicken, saying: ‘I like the thighs because they’re very juicy.’

He also denied being the shop’s most famous customer, pointing out ‘Mr Clarkson pops in from time to time doesn’t he?’. 

Mr Cameron said it was very important to him that his children ‘feel very rooted and grounded’ in Oxfordshire.

One of his children, he said, calls 10 Downing Street ‘the pretend home’.

The interview appeared to show Mr Cameron’s kitchen contains a red chopping board emblazoned with ‘Calm Down Dear’

The PM was accused of sexism in 2011 after using that slogan, taken from a TV advert, against Labour front bencher Angela Eagle.

Mr Cameron has previously said his children would be ‘heartbroken’ if Top Gear was taken off air. When details of the incident emerged, he backed calls for Mr Clarkson to be reinstated.

‘Because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people, including my children, who’d be heartbroken if Top Gear was taken off air, I hope this can be sorted out,’ he said.
