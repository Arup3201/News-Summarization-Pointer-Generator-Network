Shocking pictures show the horrific injuries sustained by a man who was beaten by a gang of yobs when he stepped in to defend a girl being jeered at in the street.

Josh Smith was outside his local pub in Smethwick, Birmingham, in the early hours of last Saturday when he says he heard a group of men taunting a girl.

The 19-year-old stepped in to defend the girl but was tripped up and punched in the back of the head by the abusive thugs.

Josh Smith was left hospitalised with a burst lip after he challenged a group of men who were abusing a girl

He twice had to step in to halt the gang's abuse and was left hospitalised after he was punched to the ground

After retreating inside the pub, Mr Smith later emerged to hear the same men abusing another group of girls, telling them they should 'kill themselves because they were ugly'.

When he again challenged the men, they turned on him and he was punched to the ground, suffering a fractured nose, burst lip and a black eye.

Mr Smith said: 'I've never bled so much in my life. When I got to the hospital I looked in the mirror and could see my teeth through the side of my mouth - it made me gag.

'From the damage the punch caused, the doctors told me it wasn't just a fist I was hit with.

'My mates think they saw something in the guy's hand but it all happened so quickly. I have to drink through a straw now and I'm in agony, but it was still the right thing to do.

'Nobody has the right to talk to women that way, especially when they were just minding their own business.'

Mr Smith is now hoping police can track down his attackers, who have left him scared to leave his home

The attack happened outside The Old Chapel pub in Smethwick, Birmingham around 2am on Saturday morning

Nearly a week after the attack, Mr Smith's right eye is still swollen and the stitches above his lip are painfully fresh.

He has been left scared to leave his home and is now hoping police can track down his attackers.

Mr Smith, who works as a singer, said: 'I just hope somebody comes forward and these lads are found.

'Not just for me, but to stop them hurting anybody else in the future. At the moment I just don't want to leave the house and I don't want anybody else to go through that.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'We were called by the ambulance service to the Old Chapel Inn, The Uplands, Smethwick just after 2am on Saturday 6 September.

'A 19-year-old man was taken to hospital for treatment. Police are investigating how he came by his injuries.'
