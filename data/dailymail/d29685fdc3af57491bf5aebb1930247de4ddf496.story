The Ministry of Justice said 'all necessary steps' were being taking to protect those potentially put at risk, including the officer who shot Mark Duggan

Firearms officers and jurors have been put at risk after two computer discs containing sensitive information about them were lost in the post.

The officer who shot Mark Duggan – whose killing sparked the London riots – is among those in danger of being identified following the astonishing blunder by Whitehall officials.

Security has been urgently overhauled, with police marksmen given extra protection in case of revenge attacks.

It is the most serious data breach since 2007 when two HM Revenue & Customs discs containing information on 25million people were lost in the post.

The latest details to go missing relate to the killings of Duggan, Azelle Rodney and Robert Hamill. The Ministry of Justice refused to discuss the nature of the lost data. But it said ‘all necessary steps’ had been taken to ensure all those potentially placed at risk were protected.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered an investigation into the ‘appalling’ breach to discover exactly how the data vanished. 

Ministers said they were treating the incident ‘extremely seriously’ and lawyers are working frantically to establish exactly what information was stored in documents on the discs.

Two of the investigations relate to the fatal police shootings of crime suspects in London – an inquest into the death of Duggan in 2011 and an inquiry into the death of Rodney in 2005. 

The third is an inquest into the 1997 murder of Mr Hamill by Loyalists in Northern Ireland, which campaigners claim involved the collusion of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

Officials realised the discs, containing thousands of pages of information, were missing on January 8. One member of staff has been suspended over the blunder.

Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said yesterday: ‘This is an appalling lapse in security concerning highly confidential information on very sensitive investigations. 

'It would be disastrous if this data got into the wrong hands.’

The Ministry of Justice said: ‘There is no evidence to indicate the information loss arose from malicious intent. 

Also on the disks, which ministers realised were missing on January 8, are details of the inquiry into the shooting of Azelle Rodney (left) in 2005, and the 1997 murder of Mark Hamill in Northern Ireland (right)

'Nevertheless, it is essential to take all necessary steps to safeguard the interests of anyone whose information could be disclosed.’

The Metropolitan Police said it had performed a risk assessment and had taken ‘appropriate steps’.

The loss is particularly sensitive as Duggan’s shooting by police led to the August 2011 riots in London – which spread across England causing five deaths and £200million of damage.

The 29-year-old, who was in the feared Tottenham Man Dem gang, is said to have brandished a firearm at officers who stopped him in north London. 

He then ran off and was shot twice, dying from a gunshot wound to the chest.

Police were cleared of killing him unlawfully despite the father-of-four being unarmed at the time.The firearms officer who shot Duggan was given anonymity when he gave evidence to an inquest, and was known only as V53.

Rodney was shot dead in north London in 2005 in a swoop by officers who thought he and two other men were going to stage an armed heist on Colombian drug dealers

An inquiry found there was ‘no lawful justification’ for killing the 24-year-old. All but one of the officers involved in the shooting have been granted anonymity.

Father-of-three Mr Hamill, a 25-year-old Catholic, died after being beaten by a Loyalist gang in Portadown, County Armagh, in 1997.

An inquiry was launched amid allegations four officers were positioned in a police vehicle near the scene of the attack but did not intervene. Its report has not yet been published. 

His family said in a statement: ‘We are asking our solicitor to seek an urgent meeting with government officials to seek answers to our concerns about this serious breach of data protection.’

Deborah Coles, of the charity Inquest, said: ‘This is an astonishing and unacceptable lapse that will further undermine public and family confidence in the way contentious deaths are dealt with. 

'It is shocking that such sensitive material can be treated with such apparent disregard, particularly considering the strict confidentiality undertakings families and their lawyers have to sign up to.’ 

Data watchdog the Information Commissioner is examining the case. 

One victim described being targeted by a convicted abuser after Labour MP Keith Vaz outed four people who had been abused as children online

Child abuse victims say they have received death threats after senior Labour MP Keith Vaz published their names on a parliamentary website.

The former Europe Minister was accused of an error of judgment after releasing emails containing the identities of four people abused in childhood and unfavourable comments about them.

The row is the latest to engulf the independent child sex abuse inquiry, which has faltered amid complaints about a lack of transparency and the backgrounds of some inquiry panel members.

Victims hit out at the decision by Mr Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, to post un-redacted emails about them on its website. 

In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, they said the blunder ‘highlighted an astonishing lack of awareness’.

Signed by the four ‘outed’ victims and 14 others who have been campaigning for changes to the inquiry, the letter said those who were named had ‘been subjected to social media hate campaigns as a result of the disclosures and negative attitudes expressed by some panel members’.

It added: ‘[One victim] and his young daughter have been targeted by [a] convicted abuser.’ Mrs May wrote to Mr Vaz to express her ‘dismay’.

The anonymity of sex abuse victims is protected by the Sexual Offences (Amendment Act) 1992.

Home Affairs Select Committee sources defended Mr Vaz, saying those he named had previously publicly declared themselves, one way or another, as abuse victims.

Despite this, he was reported last night to be in the process of apologising to the four. 

Lucy Duckworth of the Survivors Alliance told The Guardian: ‘Since this information was published the individuals have received death threats.’ 

The Home Affairs Select Committee said the material had since been redacted to remove references to the victims.

Mrs May is due to announce a new chairman for the inquiry. The two previously selected, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf, had to resign over their connections to the Establishment.
