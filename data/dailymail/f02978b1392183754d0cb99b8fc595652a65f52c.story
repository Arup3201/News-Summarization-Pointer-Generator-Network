Ever wondered how Kimberley Walsh looks so trim - despite being a few months pregnant? The secret behind the star's svelte look has been revealed as a new range of sculpting slip dresses.

The Girls Aloud singer is a huge fan of Body Frock dresses, which are engineered to emphasise your best attributes while disguising the wobbly bits.

The brand has just unveiled its SS14 range and with nods to the lace trend at Burberry and midi-length hemlines seen on every catwalk, the designers hope the dresses will help women dress to impress, all while looking at least a dress size slimmer.

Flattering: The range, which pays tribute to the lace trend at Burberry and midi-length hemlines seen on every catwalk, aims to flatter a women's silhouette

Complete with special 'sculpted slip' control lining,
 the dresses are also worn by celebrities such as Holly Willoughby and Kym Lomax.

'The inside lining should fit slim and taught like a corset', claims the brand.

Outfit solution: The range pays tribute to ageless, timeless glamour and is an elegant 'desk to dinner' solution

Date night: The designer describes her dresses as pieces that: 'women want to put on and men want to take off'

Speaking about her range, designer Melanie Davis said: 'No longer do you have that embarrassing "Bridget Jones look" when getting undressed.

'I make clothes that women want to put on, and men want to take of.'

The range, which ranges is priced between £165-£250, pays tribute to ageless, timeless glamour and markets itself as the perfect 'desk to dinner' solution.

Drop a dress size: The new collection uses a 'sculpted slip' in the lining, which promises to make it appear as though you've dropped a dress size

Big fan: Kimberley is often spotted wearing Body Frock designs like this blue one from the new range (left) and classic black shades

FEMAIL writer Deni Kirkova put the Body Frock dress to the test, but what did she think?

'Wearing the black slip I
 felt snug and sucked in. It feels like super-firm 
controlwear with thick, good quality fabric which smooths the silhouette
 and gives me a better cleavage by pushing everything up - double thumbs up!

'The lace dress itself was a little to covered up for my liking, although the lace was good quality - you can tell it’s not any old high street dress.

'Definitely worth the money.'
