A three-year-old girl was able to walk half a mile from her nursery school to her family home on her own after staff failed to spot she had left the school grounds, it has emerged.

The youngster wandered out of the nursery which is attached Springdale Infant School, in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, without staff realising on November 7.

A member of staff is now being investigated over the incident and has been moved roles within the nursery while the apparent blunder is investigated.

An investigation has been launched after the three-year-old girl wandered out of the nursery which is attached Springdale Infant School, in Wolverhampton, West Midlands (pictured), without staff realising

The young girl was not injured as a result of the incident, despite walking half a mile on her own and unsupervised.

Parents have expressed their shock at the incident, which occurred at the end of the nursery day.

One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'They need to do something to stop this happening again.

'The children come out of the building to be met by their parents but this little girl just went out by herself.

'She didn't come to any harm but that's not the point. This could have been so much worse. It's every parent's worst nightmare.

'Apparently her home is a good half-a-mile away and she would have need to cross a couple of roads too.

'It's scary what could have happened.'

The school's headteacher confirmed an investigation is underway and said a member of staff had been 'assigned to alternative duties' pending the outcome. The nursery has also 'strengthened' its procedures

Cathy Foley, the school's headteacher, said procedures had been 'strengthened' at the nursery in the wake of the incident.

She said: 'The welfare of our pupils is our top priority and an investigation is currently underway into the incident which occurred on November 7.

'A member of staff has been assigned to alternative duties pending the outcome of this investigation, and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.

'However, I would like to reassure parents that we are taking the matter very seriously and, as a result of the incident, we have strengthened our policies and procedures within the nursery to ensure that it cannot happen again.'
