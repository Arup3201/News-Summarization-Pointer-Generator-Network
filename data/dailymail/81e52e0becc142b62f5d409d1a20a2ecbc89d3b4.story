The 39-year-old Utah mother who has admitted killing six of her newborn babies was thrown out of her home by her in-laws after she began an affair while her husband was prison, MailOnline can reveal.

Megan Huntsman was told to leave the home she shared with her three daughters when she cheated on her husband Darren.

Her in-laws Stephen and Diane West, who owned the home where she lived, told her to leave in 2011 after finding out about the affair.

Huntsman, who is being held on $6million bail, is alleged to have told detectives the babies found dead in her home, were conceived with her now-estranged husband.

But news of the affair raises the 
question that some of the babies who were strangled or smothered at 
birth might have been born as a result of an extra-marital cheating.

Darren West has also told police he had no knowledge of the babies.

Aaron Hawker, who lives next door, said he had spoken with West since he made the shocking discovery of the skeletal remains.

'He has told me he has no idea where the babies come from, ' said Mr Hawker. 'He has insisted that they were not his.'

Huntsman admitted to killing the children in a period between 1996 and 2006, and police believe she was still with her husband at the time. They have ordered DNA tests to determine the paternity of the murdered children.

Mr Hawker, 73, said he was told by West that Huntsman was told to leave the marital home after she began an affair.

Her in-laws had agreed to let her to live in the three bedroom home after their son was jailed in 2006 on drugs charges.

According to Mr Hawker, one condition was that she must stay faithful to her husband while he was inside and not see any other men.

'What I was told by Darren was that she began an affair and when her in-laws found out they told her to leave. I do not know how long the affair went on for, but was told that it was with a co-worker.

'Megan left in 2011 and since then we have hardly ever seen her at the house. She would not come back very often and was told she was not welcome in the house.'

When Huntsman left, her eldest daughter Darien had just turned 18 with the next youngest Jaycee, aged 17 and the youngest Sawyer aged 11. An aunt Mary West moved into the home to help look after the girls. The two eldest daughters are now adults and the youngest is a teenager.

'We used to see the girls from time to time and they were just your average girls,' said Mr Hawker.

'I think the older ones were looking forward to dating. I have not see them since the bodies were found.'

Mr Hawker admitted that he never saw Megan pregnant or even put on any weight.

'It is a complete mystery to me and my wife Kathie. Megan was always very shy, but she was very nice.'

Mr Hawker said he wrote to her husband West after he was given a nine-year jail sentence on drugs charges.

He said he considered the sentence harsh as West claimed he had only agreed to take in a package for a friend after being offered $200.

'I thought the sentence was unjust and liked Darren. He was a lovely man and I had a lot of time for him.

'I would write to him in prison and when he got out he came to see us. We were glad he was moving back into the house.'

West was released earlier this year and was at his home in the town of Pleasant Grove, abut 35 miles from Salt Lake City when he made the horrifying discovery of the bodies.

He called his wife after opening one of the boxes to find a corpse of what is believed to be the seventh still born baby.

She is alleged to have told him it was her baby.

Connections: Megan Huntsman is in jail but she and her estranged husband have three teenage and adult daughters, though the young woman seen leaving the home has not been identified

Questions: Huntsman's youngest daughter, who is in junior high, was born during the same time period when she murdered her other babies and it is not clear why she was spared (an unidentified person pictured above at the family home on Monday)

Getting out of the house: A friend was seen helping the person in sweats get bags out of the home on Monday

Horrible job: An unidentified man was seen going in and out of the Pleasant Grove house on Monday

When police carried out a search of the garage they found six other babies. Each had been wrapped in a towel and placed in a box.

Police have said Megan has admitted to strangling or smothering six of the babiesÂ  after carrying them full term.

She said the seventh was still born.

Growing belly: Neighbor SanDee Wall often noticed Meghan sporting a baby bump, but never commented on it

While Mr Hawker did not ever suspect Megan was pregnant another next door neighbor suspected on several occasions that she was carrying a child.

'I would see her walk up the driveway and she would have the smallest of bumps on her stomach,' said 70-year-old SanDee Wall.

'I thought to myself of several occasions she must be pregnant, but I did not like to say anything to her.

'Megan was so shy and not the sort of person who would engage in conversation.'

Ms Wall said after Huntsman's husband was jailed she would often see her the worse for wear for drink.

'I
 would also smell pot quite a lot and on many occasions I would see her 
drunk.That could have been one of the reasons she was asked to leave the
 house.'

Neighbors in the quiet, tree lined street are puzzled as to how Hunstman was able to conceal so many pregnancies from her husband.

Although he worked in the construction industry he was home most nights and rarely away from his family.

'I had two of my last children at home then and as any mother who has given birth knows it can be very messy," said Mrs Wall.

'I just don't understand how she could have concealed so many babies from her husband.'

West has refused to comment since making the shocking discovery in his garage.

His parents have also declined to comment after earlier issuing a statement expressing their shock at the death of the babies.
