A social worker who was high on drugs as she hosted an all-night party where children as young as 13 were given cocaine and vodka has quit her job in disgrace.

Susan Downing, 37, who was said to be 'gurning with her jaw swinging' during the party, pleaded guilty to allowing her house to be used for the supply of cocaine and amphetamine.

She was given a two-year suspended jail term after claiming she had been 'stressed' at the time..

A 13-year-old schoolboy and a girl aged 15 who were at the 5am party in Rishton, Lancashire, said they were given cocaine to sniff through a straw and one snorted it off a key.

Disgraced: Susan Downing, 37, admitted allowing her house to be used for the supply of cocaine and amphetamine

At least one other child took drugs alongside an 'all and sundry' gathering who were also offered wine, beer and spirits in the kitchen, Burnley Crown Court heard.

It emerged the drugs had been supplied by a female friend of Downing who offered amphetamine to the 15-year-old girl saying: 'In order to take it, you would put it in a skin and bomb it.'

Rachel MacLachlan, 32, of Rishton, pleaded guilty to supplying cocaine and offering to supply amphetamine and was jailed for three years.

Police who were alerted to reports of youngsters taking drugs at Downing's party spoke to the 15-year-old girl at the party who said cocaine made her 'feel alive and gave her lots of energy.' 

She said parties were a 'regular thing' at the property and if the police had not become involved 'it would still be going on.'

Downing, who worked alongside social services as a support worker for families and children, was also fined £250. 

Prosecutor Stephen Parker said the party which took place early last year came to light when a friend found out the 13-year-old boy had been 'sniffing coke' at the party and told his relatives.

He was confronted but said he 'wasn't telling as he wasn't a grass.'

Mr Parker said: 'After being pressed further and being threatened with being taken to the police station, he eventually admitted that he had had some. They then went to the police station and the child provided a urine sample which tested positive for cocaine.'

The 13-year-old boy later told police 'loads of people turned up to the party' and he had vodka and cocaine.

Mr Parker said: 'He said at some point everyone seemed to go to the kitchen so he and another teenager went in and people were taking cocaine.

'He said there were numerous small bags on the worktops containing what he presumed to be cocaine and they were making it into lines and snorting it through straws.

'He said another teenager was taking it, as well as Downing, MacLachlan and various others who were present. He said the teenager he was with asked Rachel if she would 'sort my mate out,' at which point she handed him a key with cocaine on, telling him not to grass.

'Downing also told him not to tell anyone. He took the cocaine through a straw, like everybody else was doing.'

The 15-year-old girl  at the party  said she was given cocaine by MacLachlan after she asked for some. 

Mr Parker said: 'She said she saw both the defendants taking lines of cocaine. People were taking it off keys and doing lines when they split it with a credit card and snorted it through a straw or a rolled up note. She said she couldn't believe she actually knew all this.'

'At some point Rachel left and returned with a bag of amphetamine and asked her if she wanted some, but she declined. She said in order to take it, you would put it in a skin and bomb it.'

The prosecutor said the teenager thought amphetamine had made Downing 'bad,' as she couldn't speak or stand up, was gurning and her jaw was swinging.  

Police searched Downing's home and recovered a bag containing cocaine from the living room, various straws with traces of cocaine on them and a  bag containing cannabis and a cannabis grinder.

Downing initially claimed nobody was taking any drugs at her house and said she had never taken cocaine.

But when she was later interviewed she admitted she allowed her premises to be used for drugs usage. 

'She stated she worked alongside social services as a support worker for families and children and drug use would not be encouraged in any way by her employers,' said Mr Parker.

Downing's defence lawyer Mr Sukhdev Garcha said his client had since referred herself for counselling and now working for a charity for the homeless, advising on housing issues. 

He said: 'Her behaviour was abhorrent morally and I can understand public disgust at it - but this young woman had a blip.'

The lawyer said at the time, she had been at a very low ebb, had problems and was stressed.

'She worked for social services. She thought she couldn't ask for help as she thought that is being a failure,' he said.

'She was isolated. She sought solace in drink which had a slippery slope to drugs. She's not proud for doing that but that's an explanation as to why the events came about.

'The arrest was a wake-up call and she had realised her behaviour was not acceptable to her and to society. She is now using her life experience she gained as a result of this offending to assist others.'

MacLachlan claimed she didn't get Downing 'hooked on cocaine and she was already a user when they met. 

In mitigation Robert Elias, for MacLachlan, said her behaviour, committed when she was in drink and had taken drugs herself, had been dreadful and disgraceful and she had now sought counselling.

He added: 'Any person hearing of that sort of behaviour, giving a young child a Class A drug, merely because he's asked for it, would be absolutely horrified. Casual drug taking is no longer for her. She seems to have turned the corner. She seems to have realised that she really has got to stop doing that.

'She is ashamed and upset. She is dismayed at what she did. She realises she has behaved in a way no right-thinking person would condone. It's a completely thoughtless and stupid thing for her to have done and she knows that.' 

Judge Ian Leeming, QC, said the party involved 'disgraceful and very serious criminal behaviour'.

But he decided it was appropriate to suspended the custodial sentence on Downing 'after some misgivings.'

He told her: 'The acts done by you are not all that different to the acts done by Miss MacLachlan. The offence of supplying cocaine to two children is a grave one.'
