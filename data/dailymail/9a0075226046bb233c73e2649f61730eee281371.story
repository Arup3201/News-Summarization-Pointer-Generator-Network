A two-year-old boy with a condition so rare that doctors have never seen it before has celebrated Christmas three months late after being too ill to mark the festive period.

Milo Browne suffers from a condition that is so unique there is no diagnosis and he spent Christmas in the Great North Children's Hospital at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary fighting for his life.

However, the family were determined to wait until Milo was home before they celebrated Christmas, meaning presents have remained unopened and the decorations have stayed up.

Two-year-old Milo Browne, laughs as he finally welcomes Santa Claus to his home, three months late after being too ill to mark the festive period 

Milo's family including his parents Stephen and Laura and older siblings Mia and Felix, left their presents unopened until he was home to open them with them 

But after finally being allowed to go home, the family from North Shields in North Tyneside have now celebrated by opening presents and even welcoming Santa Claus to their home, even thought it is March.

Milo along with his siblings Mia, 7 and Felix, 3 unwrapped a whole host of presents yesterday including Frozen toys for Mia, cars and tractors for Felix and sensory toys for Milo.

Milo's father Stephen, 29, said: 'I have had to give up my job to become a full time carer for Milo but it's days like this that make it worthwhile.

'Santa made the day even more special and the kids were all in awe that he knew so much about them.

'Milo is home for now but we have to take him back to the hospital in six weeks time.

'It's a constant waiting game and with no one knowing what it is that's wrong with him it's even harder to deal with.'

Doctors had previously only gave Milo a few hours to live after he fell ill last year.

But the toddler was determined to prove them wrong and since then he has continued to baffle doctors across the country.

His rare condition means he has vision delay and severe development delay.

He also has to be fed directly through his stomach via a machine, his arms and legs are stiffer than normal and his co-ordination is poor.

The two-year-old also suffers from central hypotonia which leaves him unable to hold his weight.

But despite all this, his parents couldn't be prouder of their youngest son.

Mother Laura Davidson, 30, said: 'Milo lights up every room.

'He is such a happy boy and is always smiling despite what he's going through.'

The family have set up a website to raise funds for Milo's treatment and equipment and have built a huge support network up of people inspired by their son.

Mr Browne added: 'For a child that was expected to live only a few hours he has showed determination not to give up.

'We take everyday as a blessing. We aren't naïve, we know Milo will not always be here but we will make sure Milo will live on long after all of us are gone.'
