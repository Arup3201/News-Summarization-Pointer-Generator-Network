But he was beaten to the award by Hamilton, who last month won his second Formula One world title after a thrilling battle with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton, who earlier arrived on the red carpet with dog Roscoe, said: 'I am so speechless. I'm so proud and honoured to be among such great sporting talent. 

'I want to say a huge thank you to all the people who called in, I really wasn't expecting it.'

Nominee Gareth Bale was unable to travel to Glasgow due to Real Madrid's participation in the FIFA Club World Cup in Morocco., but the Welshman joined the ceremony via video link.

Bale said: 'The special thing is the Champions League. Every footballer wants to win the biggest competition in the world so to win and score is a dream come true.

'It's a bit difficult with the language but I'm learning slowly.

Also on the shortlist was Charlotte Dujardin, Carl Froch, Kelly Gallagher & Charlotte Evans, Adam Peaty, Max Whitlock and Lizzy Yarnold.

One of the first to arrive in Glasgow on Sunday was Sir Chris Hoy, the former track cyclist who was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award at the ceremony.

Hoy said: 'I would have said my first gold medal at the Athens Olympics couldn't be topped, until London 2012. The last medal was so emotional. When I watch the video of it now, I still get goosebumps.

'Every time I watch a bike race, I want to be out there. I was at the World Cup in London, and I wanted to be out there. But it was great to watch the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.'

Claudia Fragapane won the first award of the evening as the 17-year-old gymnast was named as the Young Sports Personality of the Year. 

Fragapane fended off competition from para-cyclist Sophie Thornhill and golfer Bradley Neil and collected the award at the same venue where she won four Commonwealth Games gold medals for England in the summer.

Prince Harry later presented the Helen Rollason Award, named after the BBC sports presenter who sadly died of cancer at the age of 43 in 1999, to the Invictus Games competitors.

The inaugural Games were held in London in September for injured service members and veterans, with around 400 people competing.

The Unsung Hero award was presented to 77-year-old Leicester swimming coach Jill Stidever in recognition of her work helping disabled children.

Paul McGinley claimed the Coach of the Year award after inspiring Europe to a five-point victory over the United States at the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles.

The golfers missed out on the Team of the Year prize which went to the England women's rugby union team, who won the World Cup following three consecutive final defeats thanks to a 21-9 triumph over Canada in Paris.

Real Madrid footballer Cristiano Ronaldo won the Overseas Sports Personality of the Year award.
