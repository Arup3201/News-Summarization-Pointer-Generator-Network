Dr Sureshkumar Pandya undertook surgery to reduce the size of a woman's labia - but was accused of female genital mutilation after it went terribly wrong

A doctor whose ‘designer vagina’ operation went so wrong that he was accused of female genital mutilation has been cleared.

Dr Sureshkumar Pandya undertook surgery to reduce the size of a woman’s labia because ‘it was ugly’, but the 33-year-old was left ‘distraught’ by the results, the Manchester tribunal heard.

The GP, who is surgically trained, mistakenly removed almost all of the vaginal lips, but did not cause damage to the clitoris, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found.

The General Medical Council had alleged the anatomical result was ‘equivalent to female genital mutilation'. 

The fitness to practise panel found the anatomical result of the procedure could be said ‘to be equivalent to FGM’, but cleared Dr Pandya of the charge as he did not intend to perform the operation on the woman, known only as Patient A.

Chair Dr Anthony Morgan said: ‘The panel has not been provided with any evidence during the course of these proceedings to suggest that you set out to remove all or virtually all of Patient A’s labia minora.

‘It has not been provided with any cultural or surgical reasons as to why you would do this.

‘In your evidence you stated that you were totally against the practice of FGM and would not have any reason to carry it out.

‘In the light of your character and the testimony you gave the panel accepts this.’

Dr Pandya admitted performing labiaplasty on the Muslim woman at London’s Regency Clinic on March 8, 2012.

He told the panel that she was unhappy with the appearance and was suffering discomfort and pain from sitting down and wearing tight clothes.

‘There was nothing unusual about this procedure, there was nothing unusual about this patient and there was nothing unusual about this operation,’ he said giving evidence.

Asked if he had intended to perform Female Genital Mutilation, he replied: ‘I am very much against it.

‘I have never done it and I don’t think I would ever do it and I didn’t intend to perform it on this patient.’

He
 added: ‘Every time when a medical intervention is done by a doctor with
 all due care, vigilance and manual dexterity, one may still come across
 these events where the outcome of a procedure is something not expected
 and contrary and I don’t think any doctor enjoys it.

Dr Pandya mistakenly removed almost all of the vaginal lips, but did not cause damage to the woman's clitoris, the tribunal heard

The doctor denied he had removed all of the inner labia, but the panel found against him, determining that it amounted to a ‘serious clinical failure’.

Dr Morgan said: ‘Your evidence was that the complete excision of the labia minora did not happen in the course of the operation.

‘On this point it preferred the evidence of the clinicians and the experts.

‘As a result, the conclusion the panel has reached is that the procedure did in fact result in the almost complete excision of the labia minora.

‘Therefore, it has found this paragraph proved on the basis advanced by the GMC, namely that what you did amounted to a serious clinical failure.’

After the operation,the woman contacted her GP and later emergency services because she was ‘distressed and unhappy’, self-harming and suffering from suicidal thoughts.

Dr Pandya was reported to the General Medical Council later that month on the basis that the woman felt ‘violated and butchered’ and had been ‘railroaded into the surgery,’ the hearing was told.

Patient A was examined by a number of doctors over the following months, but was referred to a specialist FGM clinic in July last year, after she became pregnant.

With regards to the allgation that the operation amounted to femle genital mutilation, Sean Larkin QC, for the GMC, told the panel it should only find the charge proved if the doctor had intended to perform such an operation.

Mr Larkin told the 
panel the procedure had lessened the woman's sexual sensitivity, adding: 'Was 
this mere negligence? No. Did it amount to serious professional 
misconduct? Yes.'

But Andrew Colman, defending, argued that a 
single clinical error along with admitted recording keeping deficiencies
 was not enough for the panel to reach a finding of misconduct against 
the doctor.

'I would not want anyone to think I am trivialising 
the outcome of this surgery,' he said. 'In considering the gravity it is
 important to remove it from the emotive context of female genital 
mutilation.'

Mr Colman told the panel that an arm operation 
resulted in the loss of feeling to the hand it would not constitute 
misconduct, and said: 'Neither should you view this isolated function as
 such.'

He added: 'Coming at the end of a long and distinguished 
career, these proceedings have been a painful, extended and salutary 
ordeal for Dr Pandya and I can tell you he has no desire to return to 
gynaecological surgery either at the Regency Clinic or anywhere else.'

It was also alleged that the GP was not qualified to carry out the operation because he had only worked as a gynaecologist for six months, 25 years earlier.

But he was cleared of the charge after he told the panel he had worked part-time at the private clinic since around 1994 and took a greater role after the owner died in 2011, although he said he was never paid for his services.

He could also still face sanctions over the bungled operation and admitted record keeping errors if the panel finds his errors amounted to serious misconduct.

Labia reduction or labiaplasty is the most common type of genital surgery carried out in the UK.

Although
 widely practised, cosmetic genital surgery or ‘designer vagina’ surgery
 has been criticised by experts who say it is risky and often 
unnecessary.

Dr Pandya is currently subject to an interim conditional GMC order, originally imposed in July last year, which restricts the work he is allowed to carry out.

The string of conditions keeps him closely monitored by the GMC as well as banning him from carrying out female genital operations.

The hearing continues.
