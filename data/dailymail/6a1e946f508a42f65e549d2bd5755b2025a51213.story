The mother of murdered soldier Lee Rigby has spoken of her shock as the brutal killing of journalist James Foley by a man with an English accent brought back horrific memories of her own son's death.

Both men were murdered by Islamist fanatics and both deaths were captured on film and uploaded to the internet. 

'The moment I saw the news about James's beheading, I felt my heart turn over and I just wept,' said Lyn Rigby speaking to The Sun from her home at Middleton, Manchester.

'It was like watching the murder of Lee unfold all over again.

'My heart broke looking at the pictures of his mum and dad. I could see the dignity they showed but also the raw and desperate pain they are going through.

'I want to send them so much love and compassion because I have been through what they are experiencing.'

Drummer Rigby, 25, was hit by a car and then dragged into the road by two Islamist fanatics in Woolwich, southeast London, in May last year.

Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 23, set about him with knives and a meat cleaver in a bid to cut off his head.

They had claimed that they were 'soldiers of Allah' and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing.

Adebolajo was born in Lambeth, south London, to a Christian family and educated in Romford, Essex. Adebowale was also born in the capital into a Christian family. Both men converted to Islam and were brainwashed by hate preachers.

Drummer Rigby was returning to his barracks when he was murdered. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment but are appealing their sentences.

Lyn Rigby has spoken of her heartache brought about by the video online of James Foley's murder. It has rekindled memories of her son's horrific murder

Mrs Rigby, 47, told The Sun that she cannot erase the memories of Lee's brutal murder from her mind and fears that the Foley family will be going through the same agonies.

On Tuesday terror group Islamic State (IS) released a video showing Mr Foley on his knees reading an anti-American rant before he was decapitated by what is believed to be an English jihadist.

The video is available online although Scotland Yard has threatened to arrest anyone who watches it or passes it on.

Mr Foley's parents John and Diane have also asked people not to watch it.

Diane and John Foley talk to reporters outside their home in Rochester, New Hampshire. Their son, James Foley was abducted in November 2012 while covering the Syrian conflict. Islamic militants posted a video showing his murder on Tuesday. The Foleys have asked people not to watch the video

Mrs Rigby said: 'I wholeheartedly support them. By refusing to watch, you are making a stand against the terrorists who are trying to push a nasty and violent agenda.'

She added that she managed to cope with her hurt by turning to her family. Drummer Rigby was unaware of the plot to kill him but Mrs Rigby empathises with James Foley who would have been only too aware that his death was imminent.  

'That poor man must have endured hell before he died,' she said.

'The fear he must have gone through is unthinkable but at least his suffering is over. It is his family that has inherited the suffering.'

Mrs Rigby said that the pain caused by her son's death is always with her and describes her life since as 'a hell on earth'.

'But I will never just give up, because my Lee deserves more than that. I owe it to him to live a good life and carry his name on until I am one day reunited with him.'
