Chelsea players will wear black armbands against Everton on Saturday to commemorate the passing of Lord Attenborough.

The world-renowned film actor and director, who died on Sunday at the age of 90, was the Stamford Bridge club's Life President.

And Jose Mourinho’s squad will wear armbands as a mark of respect to the lifelong Chelsea fan.

Club officials are also exploring other remembrance projects to mark Lord Attenborough’s death ahead of their next home match against Swansea on September 13.

‘Chelsea Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our Life President Lord Attenborough, CBE at the age of 90,’ read a Chelsea statement.

‘His personality was woven into the tapestry of the club over seven decades. He was a consistent force for good at the club, even in dark times.

In the stands: Attenborough was a regular at Stamford Bridge to watch his beloved Chelsea play

‘He was a club director during the glamorous, trophy-winning seasons of the early 1970s and a decade later helped keep the club at Stamford Bridge when our stadium came under serious threat from property development.

He will be greatly missed, and the thoughts of everyone at Chelsea FC are with his family and friends at this sad time.’
