Firefighters in Northern California rescued a horse that got stuck in an outdoor bathtub Wednesday.

The horse was dancing around in her stall, protecting her food trough, when she suddenly fell in around 9.30am Wednesday,  Michelle Eidam, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District captain, said.

Her food trough is a bathtub.

The 30-year-old horse, named Phantom, was stuck in the bathtub for about 25 minutes with her legs up in the air. 

Her owner saw the horse fall into the bathtub and immediately called her husband for help, the Centre Daily Times reports. Her husband, Charles Campbell, instructed her to call the fire district.

'The 911 operator got a little confused,' Campbell told FOX, 'she called [my wife] back and she says 'your husband can't get out of the bathtub? And [my wife] says 'no it's my horse.''  

Distracted: Campbell said that the horse became distracted and fell, as she danced in her stall, while checking out a potential mate

Between firefighters and the owner's family, they were able to prop the bathtub on its side and pull Phantom forward onto her feet.

The situation was a first for the fire district, FOX reports.

Campbell told FOX that the horse became distracted, as she danced in her stall, while checking out a potential mate.

'She's in heat, she shouldn't be. She's an old lady,' Campbell said.

'[She's] frisky. It's getting too close to Valentine's Day, I guess I'll have to get one of those old folk's tubs that has the door on it.' 

Phantom, a Palomino/Appaloosa mix, was not injured.

The district wrote on its Facebook page that now that the horse is back on her feet, she can 'get back to dancing around the stall!'
