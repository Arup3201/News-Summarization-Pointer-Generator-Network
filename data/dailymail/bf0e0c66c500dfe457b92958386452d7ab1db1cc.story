Millions of commuters were left stranded yesterday after the storm crippled large parts of the country’s transport network.

Rail bosses were forced to cancel thousands of services because of trees covering tracks and damage to power cables.

High winds also prompted officials to close the port of Dover in Kent and cancel ferry services running from other ports on the South Coast.

At Heathrow, more than 130 flights were cancelled and flights at other airports were delayed – affecting many families’ half-term holiday plans.

Meanwhile, drivers found many of the country’s motorways were gridlocked due to heavy flooding and poor visibility.

As well as this, plenty of smaller roads across the South became impassable due to fallen trees or chunks of masonry.

Workers who tried to get into the office yesterday faced delays of several hours, others had to turn back when they discovered blocked roads and cancelled trains, while many simply gave up and decided to stay at home.

Last night angry commuters said they had not been given enough warning about the cancellations.

Forums and message boards were flooded 
with comments, with some people complaining that rail companies had been
giving confusing and unreliable advice about the services they were 
running.

Were train companies too cautious in cancelling their morning services?

Others accused bosses of overreacting by cancelling rail services in sunny parts of the country.

Sasha White wrote on Twitter: ‘Sitting at the station in sunny Leicester and pretty much every train has been cancelled due to severe weather.’

George Thomson, who was stranded at Gatwick, wrote: ‘Opposite of the British Bulldog spirit. Flights on, buses on, but trains all cancelled on Southern Railways lines. Overcautious!’

And Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, posted: ‘How come a gust of wind disables the whole east of England rail infrastructure?’

Hours before the storm began whipping across the coast, bosses made the decision to cancel a huge raft of services which had been scheduled to run the following morning.

Yesterday Network Rail defended the decision, saying 200 fallen trees had been found on its lines.

Robin
Gisby from Network Rail said: ‘While conditions were as forecast during
the early part of the morning, the damage caused has been more severe 
than expected.’

Emma Knight, from South West Trains – which usually runs a train every minute into Waterloo Station during peak times – said that blanket cancellation was ‘not a decision that we ever take lightly’.

She added: ‘If we hadn’t had weather as predicted we could have tried to reinstate trains. But if we had gone ahead with services, people would have been stuck, and we would have trains and crews stranded all over the place.’

Rail bosses also used the crash of a passenger train yesterday to justify their decision.

The CrossCountry service, which had not picked up any passengers, hit a tree which had blown across the track by Ivybridge in Devon. The driver escaped unharmed.

Yesterday David Cameron was asked if train companies had overreacted to the storm. He replied: ‘Everyone has to act on the basis of the evidence they are given.

‘Obviously afterwards we will be able to look back and see whether people made the right decisions. But right now what matters is listening to the evidence, working together and getting things back to normal.’

Meanwhile Nick Clegg found himself having to cancel a press conference, after a crane crashed into the roof of the Cabinet Office.

The Liberal Democrat leader wrote on Twitter: ‘Today’s press conference moved to a day when there isn’t a crane on the roof.’
