Laurent Koscielny is hoping his name doesn't appear in the Guinness Book of Records anytime soon.

It was revealed earlier this week that the Arsenal defender has conceded the most amount of penalties in the Premier League since August 2010.

The Gunners centre half took his tally to seven in four seasons when he hacked down Eden Hazard last weekend during the 2-0 defeat by title rivals Chelsea.

Hazard converted the spot kick in the 27th minute to give Jose Mourinho's men the lead before Diego Costa sealed victory 12 minutes from time.

Amazingly, Arsenal team-mate Wojciech Szczesny is just one place below Koscielny on the list of shame.

And the defender, who is away on international duty with France ahead of their friendlies against Portugal (October 11) and Armenia (October 14), admits it is an area in which he must improve.

'I don’t know if Guinness have a record for that,' said Koscielny. 'Unfortunately, we do not choose. It’s something I have to resolve earlier in the play.

'When Eden comes very quickly, he either scores or I clear the ball. It was toss of a coin.

'I do not pass judgment on what you think of my games or my mistakes. The most important thing is to be good for Arsenal.'

Arsene Wenger's side entertain Hull at the Emirates Stadium in a repeat of last season's FA Cup final, when Koscielny and Co return to Premier League action on October 18.
