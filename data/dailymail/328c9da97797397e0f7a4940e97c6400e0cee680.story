Gipsies have been banned from setting up illegal campsites across an entire town after a landmark High Court ruling.

Harlow Council and Essex County Council were granted the interim injunction after Harlow, Essex, was besieged by travellers illegally camping on cycle paths, highway verges and car parks.

The ban protects 454 'parcels' of land across the town - including parks, playgrounds and schools - and is believed to be 'unprecedented' in its scale.

Besieged: Travellers camped along the side of a road in Harlow, Essex, last year. Gipsies have been banned from setting up illegal campsites across the entire town after a landmark ruling at the High Court yesterday

Ban: The injunction protects 454 'parcels' of land across the town - including parks, playgrounds and schools - and is believed to be 'unprecedented' in its scale. Above, one travellers' camp in the town last year

In total, the areas covered by the ban account for a third of the land in Harlow, according to a spokesman for the council.

Gipsies have been moved from illegal encampments in the town - which is just 25 miles from Dale Farm, formerly the site Europe's largest traveller camp - on 109 occasions since October 2013.

The temporary injunction will mean anyone illegally camping in Harlow could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court. It will remain in place until a full hearing later this year. 

The order was served to travellers who were part of an unauthorised camp at Horsecroft Place this morning. The group has since moved on from the site, a spokesman at Harlow Council said. 

Injunction papers will also be  displayed on the 454 parcels of land over the coming days.

The ban applies to 35 named travellers, all of whom have now left the town, and will also protect land from encampments by 'persons unknown'.

Two legal traveller sites in the town, with a total of 44 plots, which will be unaffected by the ruling.

Harlow Council said although injunctions had been granted in other areas of the country, it believed no ban covering an entire town had ever been applied for and granted.

'Blighted': Gipsies have been moved from illegal campsites in the town on 109 separate occasions since October 2013. Above, police attend one illegal site that was set up on a cycle path in the town last year

'Unprecedented': Harlow Council said although injunctions had been granted in other areas of the country, it believed no ban on this scale had ever been applied for and granted. Above, an illegal site pictured last year

Last year, Leeds City Council successfully applied for an injunction protecting six 'environmentally sensitive' areas of land in the city. 

And it was reported in September that Coventry City Council was seeking a 'blanket' injunction covering the whole city. 

The ruling by Mrs Justice Patterson at the High Court yesterday was welcomed by Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow, who described it as a 'major step forward in ridding the town of this blight.' 

Harlow Council leader, Jon Clempner, said: 'The town has had enough and we needed to resolve this situation with a long term solution to protect land now and in the future.

'An injunction, which covers a piece of land here and there was never going to work, so we had to look at a something which has never been done before and is town-wide.

'Months and months of detailed preparation backed up with a catalogue of community concerns meant we had a very strong case that could be put forward to the judge.

'It is not - and never has been - about persecuting any particular group of people or their way of life.

'This situation has really tested the patience of the whole community and we need to end this cat-and-mouse game which is being played. 

'Seeking a High Court injunction of this size and scale takes time and requires a huge amount of preparation to get it right especially when it has never been done anywhere before.'

Evicted: Violence erupted when gipsies were removed from the illegal site in Basildon, Essex in October 2011

But the decision has been slammed by traveller leaders.

A spokesman for the Gypsy Council said: 'Unauthorised encampments are a reaction to lack of provision by local authorities.

'What's to stop the government from applying for an injunction for the whole country and managing to totally wipe out a way of life?'

Harlow stands less than 25 miles from Europe's former largest illegal traveller site, Dale Farm, in Basildon, Essex.

Basildon Borough Council spent more than £7 million of taxpayers' money on a controversial eviction of the site in October 2011 following a 10-year legal battle.
