New York City must pay $46,000 for a 20-year-old male foster child to undergo surgery to become a woman, ruled a judge.

The New York Post reports that this is the fourth time the Administration for Children's Services has paid for a sex change operation.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Peter Moulton ordered that the ACS must pay for the genital 'reassignment, facial feminization, tracheal shaving, breast augmentation, and laser hair removal' of the plaintiff identified as D.F.

The Judge referenced the prejudice against transgendered people and said it will make it difficult for the plaintiff identified as D.F. to raise the money for the procedures on her own once she is out of foster care.

The judge said that not only is D.F. not connected with her family, she also doesn't have a high school diploma.

The ACS argued against D.F. and said she was a bad candidate for surgery because she 'misses appointments' and she is 'absent form her group home.'

Even though D.F. lacked support from the ACS, two psychiatrists and a psychologist at her group home said that she'd be a good candidate for the operation.

'Certainly for the near future, her inability to pay for the procedures is clear,' Moulton wrote.

Moulton said that the city was being 'arbitrary and capricious' in denying the funding for D.F's surgery.

'Payment by ACS for necessary medical procedures may be a transgendered youth’s only chance to achieve congruence between her gender identity and her physical appearance,” the judge wrote.'
