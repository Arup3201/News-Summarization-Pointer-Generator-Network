One of the judges who convicted drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran has revealed her guilt and devastation over the Bali Nine ringleader's scheduled to face execution this month.

Judge Roro Suryowati has claimed she breaks down each time she sees the news that drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Sukumaran are one step closer to facing the firing squad.

Speaking to News Corporation, Judge Suryowati, who no longer works in Bali, said she had disagreed with the decision in 2006 to sentence Sukumaran to death. 

'My feeling has not changed. I feel pity for them. I feel sorry for them … Now if there is news about them, I often change the channel. It makes me cry,' she said.

It comes as the families of the Australians on death row are due to make a trip to Jakarta's presidential palace on Monday to plead for the two Sydney men to be spared.

Sukumaran's mother Raji and his brother Chinthu along with Chan's mother Helen and his brother Michael will meet with Indonesia's national human rights organisation Komnas HAM to set forth the legal battle in a bid to save the condemned pair's lives.

Chinthu told News Corporation that his family have been struggling to come to terms with the 'awful punishment' as they seek mercy for the two men.

'Our days are very difficult, we can't stop thinking of what will happen and the violent way he will be killed. My mum keeps thinking about his and Andrew's dead body being handed to her, she is having nightmares,' Chinthu Sukumaran said.

It follows after the lawyer who represented the Bali Nine ringleaders when they were first sentenced to death row is putting his job on the line by claiming he has new evidence that could save the duo.

In an extraordinary twist, Muhammad Rifan says he has 'never revealed evidence' that could discredit him but he was prepared to ' take the heat' for the Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are expected to face the firing squad by the end of the month.

Their former lawyer told reporters on Saturday after meeting with the two prisoners in Bali's Kerobokan jail that there was still time before the execution to lodge another appeal to spare the pair, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay,' he said. 'It's one last thing I can do for them.'

The pair's former lawyer, Muhammad Rifan (pictured), hinted at revelations that could aid a new appeal

He said that he felt very sad about their predicament, claiming the initial trial had been infected by 'legal interests and political interests' in 2006

 The lawyer said he didn't yet know what form a new legal push would take, but he was willing to try for the pair

Mr Rifan said he went over the case history with Sukumaran for more than an hour in an effort to work out how he could team with the pair's current lawyers on a last-minute legal strategy.

He said that he felt very sad about their predicament, claiming the initial trial in 2006 had been infected by 'legal interests and political interests'. 

'At that time they were going to be sentenced to life, but there were factors which saw them sentenced to death,' he said. 'We saw intervention that time.'

'Those judges, I believe they were very sorry because after sentencing them to death, they told me that was not want they wanted.

'This highlights the problems that time, between the Indonesian government and the Australian government.

'I see at that time, the judges were not independent in sentencing the case.'

Mr Rifan said he was witness to the efforts Chan and Sukumaran had made to change themselves and other prisoners for the better.

'They don't deserve to be punished with death,' he said. 'They were foolish boys who didn't think far ahead.

'This is different to the masterminds who were controlling it.'

The lawyer said he didn't yet know what form a new legal push would take, but he was willing to try.

Likewise, he urged Australia to continue diplomatic efforts for the Sydney men 'until the last minute'. 

This comes just two days before Sukumaran's mother and sister tearfully pleaded for him to be spared after they received official word he and Chan will be executed this month.
