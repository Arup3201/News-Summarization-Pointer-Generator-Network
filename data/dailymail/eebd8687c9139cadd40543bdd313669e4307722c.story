A Tulsa woman who stabbed her six-year-old son to death while suffering a serious breakdown is to be released from a mental health facility after serving an eight-year sentence.

Sheilla Shea, 49, took son Patric's life on July, 2005, after suffering a mental breakdown brought about because of the abusive relationship she was in at the time.

She was discovered sitting on a curb on the sidewalk by police covered in the blood of young son and is only able to now confront her actions that day as she prepares to be released.

'I will forever have to live with myself and what I did,' said Shea to Tulsa World.

Shea was desperate to leave her husband, but cracked waiting for her mother and her sister to come and collect her and the children.

She was stopped from killing her two other children, aged 10 and 12, by her adult son after he saw the 'silhouette of his mother stabbing downward' in the bedroom and wrestled the knife from her.

'Sometimes I think: What if we would have made it to Texas? What if this? What if that?” Shea said to Tulsa World. 'They missed me by seven hours. … I couldn’t hang on.'

Now, nearly eight years after she was sentenced, Shea has had her release approved by Tulsa County District Judge James Caputo.

In his release order, Caputo noted that Shea had been 'very compliant' and is following all the recommended medical advice to stop a repeat of her illness.

'Somebody asked me if I was going to celebrate, and I said, ‘It is not a celebration,’ she said.

'It’s hard to be sane and know what I did,' Shea said. 'It’s not a celebration. It’s me trying to find peace with what I did.'

When she was arrested nine-years ago, Shea wanted to end all her suffering and asked her lawyer to put in no defense.

'I wanted to die,' Shea said. 'I wanted the lethal injection. I begged her.'

Release: Sheilla will be released from the Oklahoma Forensic Center in Tulsa after serving eight-years of her prison sentence

However, the court determined that Shea was insane when she took her sons life and prosecutors did not object to the verdict and eventual plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.

Now as she prepares to leave Oklahoma Forensic Center custody, Shea feels that her recovery is going well.

'During this whole process, she lost her mom,' Shena Burgess, her public defender from 2006 said.

'She dealt with it really well. She handled it better than someone who had never had any mental illness.'

'She’s really proven not only to the staff of OFC and to the board but also me how much she has changed,' Burgess said.

'She realizes she has a mental illness and that she has to live with this and she has to be medicated and she has to have the support of counseling and family for the rest of her life.'Shea said she thinks about what she calls the 'tragic event' every day.'Sometimes it’s really hard to live with what I did,' she said. 'It’s awful. It’s something I will have to live with for the rest of my life, and I try to find peace within myself to be able to live with myself.'
