A Royal Marine known as 'the commando who refused to die' after suffering 100 injuries in an Afghanistan explosion has had a leg removed - so he can play with his children.

Corporal Paul Vice, 31, suffered more than 100 significant wounds during an explosion and 'died' twice as he was airlifted back to Camp Bastion in 2011.

The father-of-four, who was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery during two previous incidents, received more than 114 wounds to his torso.

Remarkably, he had more than 400 pieces of shrapnel and stones removed from his body by surgeons, suffered a broken neck, a damaged left eye, was deafened in one ear and suffered a stroke, a brain injury and paralysis down his right side.

After surgery he recovered, and his determined spirit saw him compete at the recent Invictus Games, where he won medals in cycling and archery.

But on-going problems with his left leg have stopped him from enjoying life with his wife Tessa and their four children Honey, Alfie, Frankie and Harley.

So he made the difficult decision to remove the troublesome limb, which he referred to as 'the wet fish'.

Before having the leg removed, he wrote a message on the limb which read: 'Dear leg, thanks for all the misery and admin you have caused over the last three years. See you later pal.'

He said: 'The leg is crap - it does not do anything and I call it the wet fish. It does not do anything but cause me gip and pain and it cannot get any worse.

'I have gone through the stage of being depressed about why it happened and I have got over it.

'More importantly this is about my children. I cannot interact with them how I want. I want to be running and playing football with them, but at the moment I have problems just walking after them.

'As a family, we have all agreed that the best way forward for me is to have the leg amputated.

'I live in the here and now and my sole aim is to look after and give my children and family the best life they can get.'

Immediately following the 2011 explosion, while suffering from shock, he tried to check that all his limbs were intact, but could not move his head as the blast had broken his neck.

He was able to see a pool of blood pouring from his torso, then realised that a life-threatening amount of blood was also streaming from his neck - he had a severed artery.

His life was saved when a colleague who had escaped the blast rushed to his aid, and forced his knee into his neck to stop the bleeding.

He survived the blast, but suffered a broken neck, a stroke, a damaged left eye, was deafened in one year and suffers from an enduring brain injury which causes paralysis.

He was evacuated back to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, and a month later  started his gruelling rehabilitation at Headley Court, the tri-service rehabilitation centre in Surrey.

Cpl Vice said: 'I lay there checking myself over to make sure I still had my limbs.

I couldn't move my neck because it was broken but I remember seeing a massive pool of blood coming out of me and then felt and heard blood spouting out from my neck like a hose pipe.

'I didn't feel pain, just red hot - I thought I was on fire.

'When I felt the hole in my neck I knew it was an arterial bleed, so I thought that was it.

'That's when Richie came ploughing through the dust and stuck his knee into my neck.'

He is now the subject of a documentary, called The Commando Who Refused to Die, which will be broadcast on Friday, December 12, and includes footage of the amputation.
