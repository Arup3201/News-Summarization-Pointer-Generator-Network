A gray wolf, who wandered hundreds of miles from home in search of a mate, has been captured on camera for the first time.

The male wolf, nicknamed Journey, has been tracked via a collar he was fitted with last spring. Wolves usually mate in February - but there were no signs he has found one yet.

The collar monitored the creature as he walked away from his pack in Oregon and into California - which has not seen a wolf in 80 years.

The black and white photograph was taken in Butte Falls, Oregon on November 14 by an automatic camera set up by a hunter tracking blacktail deer. It shows a wolf sniffing around in dense forest.

It is thought to be the animal known officially as OR-7, said Robyn Schneider Brown, an Oregon state biologist.

Mr Brown said the wolf in the photo appeared to be wearing a tracking collar and that GPS data showed OR-7 was in the same area of southern Oregon.

The two-year-old wolf had been captured 
and fitted with a collar by a biologist last spring but was not 
photographed at the time.

Since OR-7 left his pack, he has walked 
more than 700 miles across mountains, deserts and major highways to 
southwestern Oregon and into northern California.

Tracking data this week
 showed the wolf appeared to be heading south, 
said Mark Stopher of the California Department of Fish and Game.

Mr Stopher said: 'From Google Earth, it 
looks like it is habitat he can find both cover and food in. A lot of 
people would like to see OR-7 become an Oregon wolf again. To me, it's a
 coin toss now what he is going to do.'

OR-7 left the Imnaha pack in northeastern Oregon last September, shortly before the state put a death warrant on his father and a sibling for killing cattle.

He is a descendant of wolves 
introduced into the Northern Rockies in the 1990s who now have a 
regional population of around 1,650.

A
 conservation group dubbed him Journey, a name picked from a list of 
entries sent by children as far away as Finland. Oregon Wild said it was
 part of an effort to make the wolf too famous to kill.

Steve Pedery, conservation director of Oregon Wild, said: 'Journey is the most famous wolf in the world. It is not surprising that the paparazzi finally caught up with him.'
