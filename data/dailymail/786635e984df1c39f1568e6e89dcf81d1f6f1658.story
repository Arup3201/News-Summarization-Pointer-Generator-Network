A teenager who lost both arms in an accident as a child has learnt how to swim and ride a bike.

Huang Haifeng from China is determined not to be beaten by his disability and can be seen in this amazing video riding down a main road on a bike.

The 18-year-old, who is a professional swimmer, uses nothing but his chin to steer around his hometown Chongqing.

He is able to turn in the road without losing his balance, managing to steer the bike perfectly.

Local media claim Huang lost his arms when he was playing outside a power transformer. 

The news comes as athletes gear up for the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Earlier this month Plymouth athlete James Arnott, who was born with Erb's Palsy, which means he has restricted movement in his left shoulder, won two bronze medals at IWAS (International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports)  at Stoke Mandeville.
