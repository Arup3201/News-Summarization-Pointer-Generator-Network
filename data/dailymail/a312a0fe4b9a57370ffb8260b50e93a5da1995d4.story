They have become the two most famous best friends in showbiz and are so close they even call each other 'wifey'.

And after starting to emulate each other's styles and even shopping together, it's no surprise to see that Rita Ora and Cara Delevingne have now exchanged friendship necklaces.

The model and singer, who have been living in each other's pockets since fashion week, have snapped up initial necklaces by jewellery brand Daisy.

Best friends: Cara Delevingne and Rita Ora have taken their friendship to the next level by exchanging these Daisy friendship necklaces

Inseparable: The model and singer met at a festival and have been the closest of friends ever since

Forget £5 friendship bracelets from Claire's accessories, Daisy's necklaces are the more modern (and much more stylish) way to confirm your friendship. 

Trendsetter Cara, 20, was the first to snap up a £30 'C' necklace and she loved it so much that she bought an 'R' one for her 22-year-old best pal, according to Grazia Daily.

Cara joined Rita in Monaco over the weekend, where the singer was being paid to perform at the Monaco Rose Ball.

After flying into the Principality 
earlier on Saturday, the pair headed to the Chanel boutique to purchase 
some designer treats before Rita's big gig later that night.

Matchy matchy: Cara already had a C necklace and loved it so much she snapped it up for 'wifey' Rita

The pair were cooing over various items in the store and asking each other's opinion.

During the day, the pair uploaded photos of them larking around in the wardrobe department, pretending to be clothes on hangers.

Rita tweeted: 'Just hangin out...Ready to wear S/S 2013 @kyledevolle ME, Wife @caradelevingne #monacoclique who you…'

Earlier
this year Rita spoke about her relationship with Cara, telling The 
Sun:  'She’s officially mine. She’s, like, untouchable. I’ve taken her 
off the market. We call each other ‘wifey’. You know what a wifey means?
It’s like your other half. Like when you get married, like, that’s your
wife!

Love affair: Rita has made it no secret that she and Cara are super close and even donned this 'Queen Delevingne' Tshirt to the Burberry show that Cara was walking in

'I have no time for the opposite sex at the moment. Strictly none. I’ve only got a wifey!'

After
meeting through mutual friends at a festival last year, the pair have 
become seemingly inseparable and Rita was shocked to see how she and Cara, 
who hails from an aristocratic background, had so much in common.

She
explained: 'We are really similar but come from totally different 
backgrounds. I found someone who is exactly like me who isn’t really 
from my world. We just kept seeing each other and naturally started 
talking more and more. And now we’re always together.'
