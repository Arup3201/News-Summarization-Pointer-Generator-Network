It was a fittingly grey and rainy day in Melbourne as hundreds of sombre mourners came together to honour the lives of the 38 Australians that were killed aboard the MH17 flight in the Ukraine on July 17.

Australians paused for a national day of mourning for the victims of the disaster, as dignitaries and victims' families and friends attended a multi-faith memorial service in Melbourne.

The grieving loved ones of those who died placed a sprig of wattle at the altar of the church as a symbol of remembrance for the victims.

Dignitaries at the St Patrick's Cathedral service included Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, state premiers and leaders from various faiths.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia was coming together on Thursday to express 'sorrow and solidarity' for the victims and their loved ones.

'You have not been abandoned and you never will be,' he said.

He said it was a time to rededicate the nation to supporting the bereaved, obtaining justice for the dead and for their families, and to working for a better world.

'The dead of flight MH17 reflect what's best in modern Australia: doctors who worked with refugees, teachers who worked with indigenous people and children with disabilities, volunteers in our armed forces and with local charities, business innovators and pillars of local communities, young people filled with passion for the life before them,' he said.

He said hundreds of police and defence personnel were working around the clock to bring home the dead with respect and dignity.

'This is what Australians do in times of trouble - we reach out to people and do what we can to help.

'We try to create order in the midst of chaos and we try to inject decency into the vilest of situations.'

The Victorian capital was chosen because 16 of the 38 Australians killed were from that state.

Flags are flying at half mast and church bells are chiming around the country in honour of the 298 people killed when the Malaysia Airlines jetliner was downed by a missile over eastern Ukraine on July 17.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the nation was united in its grief.

'May the beautiful souls of the MH17 victims be taken flight by a flight of angels to rest in eternal peace,' he said.

He said those who died on MH17 were the victims of a most 'terrible, violent and unimaginable evil'.

'We mourn 38 of our own who laughed, learned and loved beneath the Southern Cross that today flies at half mast around the nation,'he said.

He said some will call today closure, some will call it acceptance, some will call it letting go.

'Whatever it is, it will take a while,' he said.

Malaysian High Commissioner Zainal Abidin Ahmad and Dutch ambassador Annemieke Ruigrok also gave readings.

Amid the pipe organ and gothic columns, singers Katie Noonan and Abby Dobson provided a modern element to the musical set by singing the Leonardo's Bride song Even When I'm Sleeping.

Religious leaders from different faiths addressed the packed cathedral before Sir Peter spoke of the grief, shock, anger, confusion and loss felt across the globe as a result of the disaster.

'So often words do not and cannot express our true feelings and thoughts during such a time of great loss,' he said.

He paid tribute to the West Australian Maslin family, who lost children Mo, Evie and Otis - aged 12, 10 and 8 respectively - who died along with their grandfather Nick Norris in the crash.

'In spite of the enormity of their loss, the depth of their despair, their love exceeds and surmounts all the hatred in the world."

There is nothing more powerful than the love felt for children, partners, parents, family and friends, the governor-general added.'It is that love that can help us deal with even the most unspeakable of tragedies."

He thanked those at work in eastern Ukraine after the disaster and said that all Australians are united as they face the sadness of the tragedy.

People arriving at St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne described the service as a sombre and uniting moment.

Wayne Kang, an international student studying in Melbourne who lost a loved one in the disaster, met other students to walk into the cathedral as a group.

'It's a sense of respect, I think, and not just for the family that we lost. It's for everyone on the plane,' Mr Kang said.

Sydney resident Kerrie Dunn said on her way into the service that it was a meaningful occasion.

'It helps to bring the nation together and the people together."

Mrs Dunn said she did not personally know anyone lost in the downing of the flight 'but I think that it's a global thing. You feel for everybody, and all the relatives that lost somebody on the flight.

'Those people were, I'm sure, eager to get to their homes and families and continue on with their lives, and they have been cut very short.'

Mrs Dunn said she also wanted to pay tribute to the workers who had risked their lives to recover the bodies in eastern Ukraine, and to investigate the crash site.

Another man, who wanted only to be described only as a mourner, said the downing of flight MH17 was a 'despicable' act.
