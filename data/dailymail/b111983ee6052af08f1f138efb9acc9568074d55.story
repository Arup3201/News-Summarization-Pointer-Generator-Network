The Most Rev Justin Welby said most employers could afford to pay the living wage 

The Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday told all employers that they should pay the living wage – even though the Church of England pays less to its own low-paid workers.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said that most businesses can afford to pay the living wage – which is at least £1.35 more than the minimum wage – and told them: ‘Just get on with it.’

He added in an interview with ITV News: ‘It can be done, and it should be done. It is not two holidays in Bermuda every year.’

However Archbishop Welby rapidly came under criticism for telling other employers to do what the Church refuses to do itself. One Tory MP, Philip Davies, accused him of hypocrisy, saying: ‘He should be getting his own house in order before he goes around lecturing everyone else.’

The row over the Church and the living wage follows Archbishop Welby’s charge last week that ‘there are entire towns and regions of our country that are being left trapped in an apparently inescapable economic downward spiral’.

In a contribution to a book edited by the CofE’s number two, Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu, he called for ‘solidarity’ to replace individualism and consumerism.

In the book, widely seen as an attempt by the Archbishops to intervene in the election campaign, he said the country should have an economic programme based on four ‘essential building blocks’, with one of them the living wage.

The Church’s failure to pay the living wage itself opens Archbishop Welby to the same kind of embarrassment he suffered in 2013 when he pledged that the Church would encourage credit unions to compete payday lender Wonga ‘out of existence’. It then turned out that the Church had a £75,000 investment in Wonga.

The living wage is worked out, with the backing of charities and some major companies at a level calculated against the cost of living, to allow a decent standard of living. The idea has backing from both David Cameron and Ed Miliband.

It is set this year at £7.85, and £9.15 in London. This is higher than the Government’s legal minimum wage, which is currently £6.50 an hour.

The Church of England has 72 care workers employed by its Pensions Board in supported housing schemes who are paid less than the living wage. It has promised that their pay will be raised to the Church’s recommended living wage level, but only gradually, ‘in stages’, and only from April onwards.

The pressure on employers from the Archbishop to put workers onto the living wage now appears to contrast with the CofE’s lethargy about raising the low wages of its own staff.

Archbishop Welby said in his contribution to the book published last week, On Rock or Sand?, that there were not only ‘moral and economic arguments for paying a living wage but also a number of possible ways in which paying the living wage could have a positive multiplier effect in other aspects of life – including in educational attainment, health and family stability.’

Mr Davies, MP for Shipley, said that the Church should not be telling other businesses to do what it was not prepared to do itself.

‘There are many small businesses around the country that might have considerably more difficulty raising wages than the CofE,’ he said. ‘Archbishop Welby might want to take the log out of his own eye before he complains about the speck in everybody else’s.’

Economist Ruth Lea of the Arbuthnot Banking Group – herself an Anglican – said: ‘Businesses have to stick to the law and pay the minimum wage. Beyond that it has to be up to them what they pay people, according to what they can afford.

‘Businesses have to pay enough to keep staff and they have to look out for their staff. They have to decide what is sensible pay for themselves.’

A spokesman for Archbishop Welby said: ‘The Archbishop would want to see the workers paid the living wage as soon as feasibly possible.’
