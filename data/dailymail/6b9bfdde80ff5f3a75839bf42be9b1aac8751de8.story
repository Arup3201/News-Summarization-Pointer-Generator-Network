Diane Sawyer signed off as anchor of ABC's 'World News' on Wednesday,
 telling viewers that it has been wonderful to be the 'home port' of the
 network's news team each weeknight.

She will be replaced next week by David Muir. The 68-year-old Sawyer,
 one of television news' best-known personalities, has anchored ABC's 
flagship newscast since December 2009.

While it's been known for months that this was Sawyer's last week as 
anchor, it wasn't until she tweeted earlier Wednesday that it became 
clear she wasn't anchoring on Thursday and Friday.

Deep privilege: Diane Sawyer left her position as anchor of ABC's World News on Wednesday night with little fuss and thanked her team and her viewers for the 'deep privilege' after five years at the helm

On Wednesday's 
newscast, she chatted briefly on the set with Muir and took viewers on a
 behind-the-scenes tour pointing out people who worked at 'World News.'

'It has been wonderful to be the home port for the brave and 
brilliant forces of ABC News around the world and to feel every single 
night that you and I were in a conversation about the day together,' she
 said.

'With gratitude for these years, I thank you, and I’ll see you right back here on ABC News very soon.'

Even when the night's news is bad, Sawyer said she felt she shared a conviction with viewers that things will get better.

She said of Muir, 'he is my friend and you are in strong and steady hands.'

Sawyer isn't retiring. She said Wednesday that she will move 'down 
the hall and up the stairs' to a reporting job.

She will be expected to 
compete for big newsmaking interviews at the network, with more room to 
maneuver now that Barbara Walters isn't working regularly anymore.

'World News' has been a steady No. 2 in the ratings to NBC's 'Nightly
 News,' anchored by Brian Williams, for most of Sawyer's tenure, 
although in recent months it has made inroads among some younger 
viewers.

CBS, with Scott Pelley as anchor, is the third-place network.

The 
68-year-old announced her departure a day earlier than most were 
expecting and tweeted: ‘See you tonight for my last anchoring - great 
adventures ahead!'

It is the fourth time that ABC has swapped anchors since the death of ABC veteran Peter Jennings in 2005.

Earlier
 this year, ABC announced that her replacement will be David Muir, who 
often sits in the anchor chair when Ms Sawyer is off.

He will officially take over the hot seat on September 2.

According to sources, Ms Sawyer felt that the time was right to make her exit and has done so on her own terms.

She confided in just a handful of close friends about her plan to leave and is leaving with little fuss or fanfare.

But she has already signed up for a new 'adventure.'

She
 will be heading up an investigative unit for ABC News but will not 
receive the bumper $20million salary that she reportedly got when she 
was the face of World News.

Nevertheless
 she will remain at the heart of the news operation, working alongside 
reporters and editors who have been carefully chosen for the job.

Many of her new colleagues are said to be already working for Nightline and Good Morning America.

During her long career, Ms Sawyer has had several high profile roles.

In 1984, she became the first female correspondent on 60 Minutes, a CBS News investigative-television news magazine.

During her five years with 60 Minutes, the program regularly ranked among the top-five most-watched in the country

She moved to ABC in 1989 anchored the news magazines Primetime and 20/20 and later co-anchored Good Morning America.

The
 well-loved anchor has had many career highs including interviews with 
past and present world leaders including President Obama, Saddam Hussein
 and Fidel Castro.

She
 has also landed scoops which include the first interview with Jaycee 
Dugard about her years of captivity and abuse at the hands of Phillip 
Garrido.

And the reporter and anchor managed to land an exclusive interviews with Amanda Knox.

And in the ongoing ratings battle among news broadcasters ABC World News has been scoring well against NBC's Nightly News.

In fact, according to Nielson, the network's ratings are at a five-year high.

Ms Saywer managed to attract an average audience of about 7.36 million viewers to World News last week.

In the coveted ‘news demo’ spot which is of concern to advertisers, ABC's World News led the pack.

It
 had 1.918 million viewers of adults 25-54, followed by NBC's Nightly 
News With Brian Williams with 1.860 million and CBS Evening News With 
Scott Pelley with 1.635 million.

Ms Sawyer is expected to jump back into the anchor chair for prime-time specials and big interviews.
