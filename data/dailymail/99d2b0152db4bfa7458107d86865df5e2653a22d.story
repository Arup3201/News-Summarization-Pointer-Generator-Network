A Universal flu vaccine to protect against new strains of the bird and swine flu may be a step closer thanks to British research.

For decades the key to creating a vaccine to protect against all forms of flu has eluded scientists.

Current vaccines only target the most common strains by making the immune system produce antibodies to prevent infection.

But they remain one step behind the virus, which keeps evolving.

However, thanks to a study carried out during the 2009 swine flu outbreak, the annual flu season could be reduced and future pandemics prevented.

Scientists at Imperial College London used the outbreak as a ‘unique’ natural experiment to investigate why some people got sick while others did not.

Hundreds of staff and students donated blood samples as the pandemic took off and were then monitored over the next two flu seasons.

Those who did not get sick had more virus-killing immune cells, known as CD8 T cells, in their blood at the start of the pandemic, the study found.

A new vaccine would work by prompting the body to produce these cells to fend off the virus.

Professor Ajit Lalvani from the National Heart and Lung Institute said the discovery has provided the  ‘blueprint’ for a vaccine, adding: 'New strains of flu are continuously emerging, some of which are deadly, and so the holy grail is to create a universal vaccine that would be effective against all strains of flu.

Influenza kills between 250,000 and 500,000 globally per year, according to the World Health Organisation.

The ICL announcement comes after scientists in America said they thought they might have developed 'universal' protection against the killer virus.

Speaking in May, the US researchers said the vaccine was created by a team working for US healthcare company Sanofi using techniques that have also raised hopes of a new generation of vaccines against other diseases.

Prof Lalvani's team recruited 342 staff and students at Imperial to take part in their study in autumn 2009, following the outbreak of the flu. 

Volunteers donated blood samples and were given nasal swabs, supplying regular updated information about their health. 

Researchers found those who fell more severely ill with flu had fewer CD8 T cells in their blood, and those who caught flu but had no symptoms or only mild symptoms had more of these cells.

Prof Lalvani said: 'Our findings suggest that by making the body produce more of this specific type of CD8 T cell, you can protect people against symptomatic illness. This provides the blueprint for developing a universal flu vaccine.

'We already know how to stimulate the immune system to make CD8 T cells by vaccination.

'Now that we know these T cells may protect, we can design a vaccine to prevent people getting symptoms and transmitting infection to others.

'This could curb seasonal flu annually and protect people against future pandemics.'
