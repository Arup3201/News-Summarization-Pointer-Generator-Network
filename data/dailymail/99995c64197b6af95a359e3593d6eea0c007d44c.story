A top Bank of England executive was yesterday accused of being asleep on the job despite repeated warnings that Britain’s banks were fiddling key interest rates.

Paul Tucker was slammed for ignoring the warnings and failing to take notes of key meetings – shortly after a string of newly-published emails detailed his cosy relationship with top bankers and civil servants.

During a ferocious grilling by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Andrew Tyrie, the chairman and a Tory MP, warned: ‘This does not look good, Mr Tucker'

Denial: Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, told the Treasury Select Committee he did not encourage the manipulation of Libor by Barclays

Scrutiny: Andrew Tyrie MP (left), chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, grilled Mr Tucker (right) on what he knew about rate-fixing

But the Bank’s deputy governor fought
back, insisting he was simply not aware that banks had been 
‘low-balling’ their submissions on Libor, the inter-bank lending rate.

‘Low-balling’ is a slang reference to
banks submitting lower Libor rates in a bid to make themselves appear 
stronger than they actually are.

In an explosive warning, Mr Tucker 
said the whole financial system needs to be reviewed amid fears the 
unfolding Libor rigging debacle is just the start of the scandal. He 
said: ‘We can’t be confident of anything after learning of this 
cesspit.’

Questioning: The committee heard from Mr Tucker after Bob Diamond released his note of a phone conversation between the two men

have been released

Under fire: Barclays has had billions wiped off its shares since it was rocked by the Libor-fixing allegations and the resignation of Bob Diamond

All financial indicators, such as 
Libor, which are based on a bank’s opinion, rather than an actual 
transaction rate, should be over-hauled, even if they appear ‘squeaky 
clean’, he said.

Paul Tucker flatly denied that any senior figure in the former Labour government asked him to 'lean on' Barclays to lower its submissions.

His comments appeared to contradict statements made last week by Chancellor George Osborne, who claimed that members of Gordon Brown's inner circle had put pressure on the bank.

Speaking to The Spectator magazine last week, the Chancellor said people around Mr Brown 'were clearly involved' in the discussion about how to keep Libor down and had 'questions to answer' about rate-fixing.

In a reference to shadow chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Osborne said: 'My opposite number was City minister for part of this period and Gordon Brown’s right-hand man for all of it.

'So he has questions to answer as well.'

To avoid any doubt about who he was referring to, Mr Osborne added: 'That’s Ed Balls, by the way.'

Mr Osborne did not mention any other individuals by name, but it was widely assumed that he was referring to former Treasury minister Baroness Vadera, a close ally of the ex-prime minister.

However, Mr Tucker challenged these suggestions in a key exchange with committee member Pat McFadden, a Labour MP.

Mr McFadden asked: 'Did (the Downing Street chief of staff in 2008) Jeremy Heywood or any other Government official that you have mentioned... ever encourage you to lean on Barclays or any other bank to lower their Libor submissions?'

Mr Tucker replied: 'Absolutely not.'

McFadden: 'Did any government minister from the last government ever encourage you to lean on Barclays or any other bank to lower their Libor submissions?'

Tucker: 'Absolutely not.'

McFadden: 'Specifically, did Shriti Vadera ever ask you to lean on Barclays or any bank to lower their Libor submissions?'

Tucker: 'Absolutely not, and if I may just add, what is more I don’t think that I spoke to Shriti Vadera throughout this whole period at all.'

McFadden: 'Did Ed Balls ever ask you to lean on Barclays or any other bank?'

Tucker: 'No, no.'

McFadden: 'Or any other government minister?'

Tucker: 'No.'

Mr Balls seized on Mr Tucker's comments and swiftly issued a statement calling on Mr Osborne to apologise.

'It is now absolutely clear that the Chancellor’s allegations last week were totally false and completely without foundation,' Mr Balls said.

'George Osborne should now publicly withdraw these false allegations and apologise.

'With the economy in a double-dip recession and our banks in need of serious reform, the country needs a Chancellor who works full-time in the national economic interest.'

Mr Tucker, who had asked to give 
evidence to MPs, used the word ‘cesspit’ several times to refer to the 
manipulation of Libor by Barclays and up to 20 other banks.

Emails released yesterday after a 
Freedom of Information request by Labour MP John Mann reveal that Mr 
Tucker was in regular contact with Barclays boss Bob Diamond at the 
height of the financial crisis.

In one email sent to Mr Diamond and 
the then Barclays chief executive John Varley, he wrote: ‘Could I talk 
to one of you about Libor, please? It’s a slightly sensitive point.’

Other communiques between Mr Diamond,
who was forced out of Barclays last week, and Mr Tucker and former 
No 10 permanent secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood reveal how informal their 
conversations were. Messages were exchanged on a Sunday and references 
made to ‘dinner’.

In one email sent on October 21, Sir 
Jeremy, who had recently had ‘supper’ with Mr Tucker, asks why Libor is 
not falling ‘as fast as [in the] US?’

Five days later, he emails Mr Tucker on a Sunday to say he is ‘an advocate’ of finding ways to speed up the fall in Libor.

Although the emails fail to prove 
that the Bank put Barclays under pressure to fiddle the Libor rate, MPs 
from all parties attacked Mr Tucker amid suspicions that he knew that 
Libor was being fiddled but did nothing about it.

They quoted from minutes of a Bank 
meeting, chaired by Mr Tucker, on November 15, 2007, at the height of 
the credit crunch attended by all Britain’s banking giants.

In paragraph
2.1, it says: ‘Several group members thought that Libor fixings had 
been lower than actual traded interbank rates through the period of 
stress.’

Mr Tyrie said: ‘This does not look 
good, Mr Tucker.

'That you have [in these minutes] what appears to any 
reasonable person a clear indication of low-balling about which nothing 
was done.

In a further blow, he was lambasted 
for failing to do anything after Mr Diamond appeared to clearly tell him
that other banks were fiddling their Libor rates.

Mr Diamond, who resigned last week, 
wrote a note on October 29, 2008, following a phone call from Mr Tucker.

Mr Diamond wrote: ‘I asked if he could relay the reality, that not all 
banks were providing quotes at the levels that represented real 
transactions.’

Questioned by Tory MP David Ruffley, 
Mr Tucker said: ‘A bell did not go off in my head [that banks were 
lowering their Libor submissions.]’

He said: ‘I did not understand Bob 
Diamond’s conversation to be a whistleblower conversation at all.

He did
not say, “Listen, Paul, I’m trying to tell you something absolutely 
terrible”.’

As a result of Mr Diamond’s note, his
deputy, Jerry del Missier, who also resigned last week, instructed 
Barclays staff to start cutting its Libor submissions.

Mr Tucker also came under fire for 
failing to keep a note of this crucial conversation despite the fact 
that it is the Bank of England’s policy to make a note of all important 
conversations.

He told MPs yesterday that he 
‘greatly wished’ he had taken a note, but said his note-taking had 
imploded when the financial crisis struck in 2007.

When Mr Tyrie said the situation at the Bank was ‘a bit of a mess’, Mr Tucker agreed: ‘It was a mess, Mr Chairman.’

October 22: Mr Tucker asks for meeting with Barclays Chief Exec John Varley to discuss 'a slightly sensitive point.' He then writes to another Barclays worker asking about 'the structure and sources of your money market funding before the turmoil began.'October 25: Mr Tucker sends an e-mail to Bob Diamond and writes he was 'struck that your govt gnteed bond was issued at around 140 (points) over gilts', 'That’s a lot,' he said.October 29: Bob Diamond and Paul Tucker speak on the phone, and he writes a note suggesting Mr Tucker was condoning Barclays submission of low Libor bids.October 30: Mr Diamond writes again saying simply: 'Investor confidence is slowly (very slowly) returning.
