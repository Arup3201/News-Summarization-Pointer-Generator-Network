A  controversial Dutch television show has screened a comedy sketch about the brutal butchering of soldier Lee Rigby.

Langs De Leeuw, which last week showed the host sucking milk directly from a young mother's breasts, appeared to make light of the gruesome murder in Woolwich in a spoof Eurovision Song Contest sketch.

The sketch showed two men who had been dressed to resemble Drummer Rigby's alleged killers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale -  waving bloody knives and cleavers at the cameras.

The Saturday night sketch comes just a week after de Leeuw sucked milk from a woman's breasts on the show. 

Host Paul de Leeuw had invited a group of women from a charity which allows the exchange of breast milk between mothers to his entertainment show, Langs de Leeuw.

During an interview with the women, the host asked whether breast milk was 'nice and sweet' and asked if he could taste some. 

One of the women offered him a bottle of the milk but de Leeuw said he would prefer to drink from the source.

'Well, if you don't bite you may try it,' the volunteer, named Wendy, said.

De Leeuw leaned in to drink from one of her breasts before pulling back and starting on the second breast.

'I find the second one better tasting, but I can taste that you've eaten asparagus yesterday,' de Leeuw quipped.

The segment has generated criticism on social media but volunteer Wendy defended the unusual exchange, saying it was 'for a good cause'.

VARA has today released this statement: 'Last Saturday ‘De Kwis’, the satirical part of the Dutch television program ‘Langs de Leeuw’, referred to the recent attack in London. This is experienced by some viewers as inappropriate. 'We would like to respond. The attack in the UK was shocking and is a human drama. This is not only public opinion but also the opinion of broadcaster VARA, presenter Paul de Leeuw and those involved in the making of ‘De Kwis’. 'Everyone handles the feelings that tragedies like these raise in their own way. Comedians often prefer to deal with difficult emotions by joking about them. Many times that works well. An important function of humor is it being an outlet. It gives air. But sometimes it doesn’t work well. The pain and the shock that a particular incident has brought about is so intense that there is – for some – no place for airiness. ‘De Kwis’ is an independent part within the program ‘Langs de Leeuw’ and is written and developed without host Paul de Leeuw. The creative team is responsible for what they do. 'The joke with the two Britons was actually not at the expense of the dead soldier. A very absurd side of reality (the insane attack) was compared to a trivial side of reality (the madness surrounding the Eurovision Song Contest). If people will feel hurt, we regret that.'

It was signed 'The creators of De Kwis'
