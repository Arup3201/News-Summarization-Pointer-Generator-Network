Sitting on the sidewalk with his head bowed, drunk driver Mark Mullan can't bear to look back at the two covered bodies lying on the Seattle road - whose deaths he was allegedly responsible for.

Led away in tears from the scene, Mullan, who has five prior DUI arrests and a suspended license, plowed into doting grandparents Dennis and Judith Schulte while they were out for a walk on Monday morning with their daughter-in-law and their 10-day-old grandson.

The much-loved teachers had moved recently from Indiana to the West Coast and were pronounced dead at the scene, while pediatric nurse Karina and son, Elias Ulkiksen-Schulte are currently in a critical condition at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.

Mullan is being held on investigation of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault. Prosecutors have until Thursday to formally charge him.

A police officer said in court documents that he smelled alcohol on Mullan's breath and that Mullan showed impairment on sobriety tests. A preliminary test showed a breath alcohol level of 0.22, nearly three times the legal limit of 0.08, the officer said.

His license was suspended at the time of the crash at an intersection in a residential neighborhood, according to the documents. 'He does not have a valid license,' said Brad Benfield, a spokesman with the Department of Licensing.

He also did not have an ignition interlock deivce installed on his Chevrolet pick-up, which an earlier court ruling ordered him to have installed.

'They were so elated. This is their only grandchild,' said Judith Schulte's sister, Susan Morton.

Karina Schulte 'had the baby in a sling on the front. He just hit all four of them,' said Morton, of Cottonwood, Minn., in a telephone interview.

Mullan told police he was unable to see the pedestrians because the sun was in his eyes, according to court documents.

His license was suspended at the time of the crash, according to the documents.

'He does not have a valid license,' said Brad Benfield, a spokesman with the Department of Licensing.

It was unclear Tuesday whether Mullan had legal representation. A message left with an attorney who represented him in a drunken driving case in December was not immediately returned Tuesday.

Mullan didn't answer reporters' questions as police led him away from the scene of the crash in handcuffs Monday. Police said he stopped after the crash and was cooperative. A phone number listed for Mullan was disconnected.

The Schulte's had just moved from Indiana to be near their new-born grandchild who was delivered just two weeks ago

Mullan has a history of driving drunk. His most recent arrest for drunken driving was on Christmas Day when he struck a Seattle motel and was found to have a blood-alcohol content four times the legal limit.

Prior to the Christmas Day arrest, Mullan was arrested four other times related to driving under the influence.

In October of 2012, Mullan was arrested by Washington State Patrol in his black Chevrolet pickup, after speeding on the Alderwood Mall Parkway.

His blood-alcohol level was measured at .14 percent.

His Christmas Day arrest came after he drove into The Seals Motel in Seattle on two separate occasions on the same evening. Police wrote that he was so intoxicated he could not get out of his truck without help.

He also provided police with a false name - his twin brothers' - something that he has done at least once before according to police documents.

On that occasion his blood alcohol level measured .32 percent, which is more than four times the legal limit. Police believed that he was so drunk that they called paramedics and sent him to Harborview Medical Center.

The victims were crossing 33rd Avenue Northeast at Northeast 75th Street in Seattle, with Ulriksen-Schulte carrying her son, when the pickup struck them

At the time of his accident his license was suspended due to the five prior occasions he had been in trouble with the law.

Morton said Karina Schulte, who is from Chile, works as a pediatric nurse specialist and is dedicated to her work.

Dennis and Judith Schulte were both longtime high school teachers; she taught English and was a head guidance counselor at Northwestern High School for years, while he taught math and coached at Western High School.

'People like her don't come around very often,' said Northwestern High School Principal Al Remaly. 'She was just all about the kids and all about anything she could do for them.'

Judy's brother, J. Hugh Dwyer, said his sister and her husband made a big impact in their community.

'Between the two of them, they probably positively influenced thousands of high school students,' he said.

They had moved to Seattle from Kokomo in February to witness the birth of their first grandson. They had planned to spend six months in Seattle to be near their son and his family. They were renting an apartment near the intersection where they were killed.

'They were so elated. This is their only grandchild,' Morton said. 'They wanted to be there when he was born. They got to hold him and be there with him for 10 days.'

Judy Schulte was a dedicated volunteer at Kokomo Urban Outreach , said DeAnna Ancil, who directs the group's food pantry operations. Ancil said Judy Schulte 'beamed' about having a grandchild.

Friends and relatives say the couple had begun planning a move to Seattle when they learned Ulriksen-Schulte was expecting their first grandchild

'That's the positive thing, that they were able to see the grandchild and enjoy him for two weeks and enjoy the family connection,' Ancil said. 'But (it's) just such a shock still for all of us.' 

Retired teachers Judy and Dennis Schulte had devoted their lives to helping children.

'That was their thing, and they were very good at it,' said Reverand Ronald Mann, pastor of Russiaville United Methodist Church near Kokomo, to the Seattle Times.

'They were wonderful people who will be greatly missed.

'They were both very active in the life of our church,' said Mann, who noted Judy Schulte was in charge of the children’s ministry and gave sermons to children.

Ulriksen-Schulte, who suffered a crushed pelvis and cranial bleeding, and Elias, whose injuries were not disclosed, were in critical condition Tuesday at Harborview Medical Center.

The Schultes celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary in June 2011.

Judy Schulte worked as a guidance counselor and teacher at Indiana's Northwestern Schools and colleague Ryan Snoddy said that even after her retirement in 2008, she still would return to help.

'She was a great lady who inspired a lot of kids,' he said. 'Judy and Dennis were doing what they loved, which is spending time with their family. To have this kind of tragedy just really takes the breath out of you.'
