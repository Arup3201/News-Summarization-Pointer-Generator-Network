It was almost two years ago that Darwin the Japanese macaque was spotted wandering outside an Ikea store in Toronto in a jazzy shearling coat. 

Now the monkey who sparked a social media frenzy and was dubbed the 'Ikea monkey' is looking for a new home.

He is currently living at a primate sanctuary in Ontario, east of Toronto, but they are hoping to relocate to a new property by the spring of 2015 and have launched a fundraising campaign. 

They hope to raise more than $490,000 for the new home which will also cater for 41 other monkeys.

Darwin became an internet sensation when he was pictured scuttling round an Ikea store almost two years ago

The monkey escaped from a crate in his owner's car and wandered all the way into the store in Toronto 

Animal services seized Darwin and sent him to Story Brook Farm sanctuary where he has lived since - they now want to move to a new property and hope to raise $490,000

Darwin became an internet sensation when he escaped from a crate in his owner's car in the Ikea parking lot. 

Pictures of the monkey wearing a tiny beige shearling coat as he wandered all the way into the store quickly went viral. 

Animal services seized Darwin and sent him to Story Book Farm, prompting its owner, Yasmin Nakhuda, to sue the sanctuary in an effort to get him back.

At the trial, the real estate lawyer said: ‘I think when I had my two children I didn't have time to mother them. I was more focused on building my practice.

‘Having Darwin ...was like the chance to experience motherhood again. 

‘I treated him like a son. It sounds bizarre to some people, but that’s how we treated him.' 

An Ontario Superior Court justice said while Darwin may have worn clothing and slept in his former owner's bed, he was a wild animal and that Nakhuda's ownership ended with his escape from her car.

Nakhuda decided to appeal the ruling but abandoned her effort, saying it was too costly and had little chance of success.

While living with owner Yasmin Nakhuda, Darwin slept and showered with her and was rarely out of her sight

The monkey was baby bottle fed at night time and required at least three diaper changes a day

Animal services seized Darwin and sent him to Story Book Farm, prompting its owner, Yasmin Nakhuda (pictured), to sue the sanctuary in an effort to get him back - she failed in her efforts to do so 

Up until the day that he escaped his human mom, Yasmin Kakhuda, Darwin had spent most days dressed in snazzy clothes and a diaper

The founder of Story Brook Farm said Darwin's story put the spotlight on the sale of exotic animals as pets in Canada.

The sanctuary says Darwin has now grown into a 'much larger, energetic and rambunctious juvenile.'

It says its new home will have wide open spaces and forested enclosures for Darwin and his fellow sanctuary residents.

A $10 donation to the fundraising campaign yields a 'virtual kiss' from Darwin in the form of a video and an e-note.

A $200 donation pays for a tour of the sanctuary and $500 results in five visits to Darwin in one year.

The online campaign was launched on Tuesday and had raised about $3,400 after two days.
