Mick Jagger reportedly left L'Wren Scott behind on the latest Rolling Stones world tour because his bandmates branded her the group's Yoko Ono

Mick Jagger left his girlfriend L’Wren Scott behind on the latest Rolling Stones world tour because his bandmates branded her the group’s Yoko Ono, according to a report in the US.

The other Stones allegedly ‘loathed’ the 49-year-old American fashion designer because she was so controlling.

‘When they saw her, they said, “Here comes Yoko”,’ a source told the New York Post.

The taunt was a reference to John Lennon’s widow, who was widely blamed for causing the Beatles’ break-up in 1970.

Miss Scott was also snubbed by other group members who refused to wear the stage clothes she offered to design for the ‘14 on Fire’ tour which began on February 21 in Abu Dhabi and continued with performances in Tokyo, Macau, Shanghai and Singapore. ‘She ended up designing just Mick’s outfits,’ the insider told the Post.

The Australian and New Zealand legs of the tour was cancelled this week after the fashion designer hanged herself in her New York apartment on Monday.

Yesterday Sir Mick, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts left Perth, Western Australia, by plane. A grim-faced Jagger, wearing dark sunglasses and black cap, was driven to the boarding steps as he prepared for the journey.

After arriving in Los Angeles, he went straight to the home of his daughter Karis, where he was expected to be joined by his other daughters Elizabeth, Georgia May and Jade and son James.His representative said: ‘He will stay in LA while the funeral arrangements are being made in New York.’

In its report the New York Post also claimed the 70-year-old singer, who had dated Miss Scott for 13 years, apparently told her it was better if she did not accompany him this time even though she had travelled with the band for the past decade.

The source close to Miss Scott alleged Jagger’s ‘rejection’ must have been ‘a huge blow to her’.

The same newspaper claimed earlier 
this week that Jagger had dumped the designer only weeks before leaving 
for the tour, an allegation the grief-stricken rocker dismissed as 
‘horrible’ gossip.

Last night Jagger’s representative said the claim that Miss Scott was not welcome on the Stones tour was ‘ridiculous’.

Miss
 Scott had struggled to get along with Jagger’s family, according to the
 unnamed source quoted by the Post. ‘She tried really hard to get along 
with Mick’s daughters. She was always inviting them to family holiday 
dinners, but they just didn’t warm to her.

‘They also thought she was controlling, and that Mick was different, more reserved and less fun, when he was with her.’

The source also cited the ‘serious financial problems’ faced by the 6ft 3in designer’s company. ‘While the clothes were beautiful, they were really only made to fit someone like her – and not many people look like her,’ they said. ‘Mick had helped her with investment money, but it still wasn’t going anywhere.’

The New York Times revealed yesterday that Miss Scott was planning to announce the closure of her debt-ridden firm on Wednesday.

‘The decision to close her business must have been very sad and humiliating for her,’ the source said. ‘She had a lot of pride. That, combined with being told she couldn’t go on the Stones tour, could have been the straw that broke the camel’s back.’

Miss Scott spent a few days last week in Mustique. On Sunday night, hours before she took her  life in her New York apartment, she had a dinner party for friends.
