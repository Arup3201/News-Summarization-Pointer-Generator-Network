George Osborne today tore into the Lib Dems, accusing his coalition partners of risking 'chaos' in the economy.

The Chancellor called on the Lib Dems to lay out plans for 'hefty' income tax rises after the election to deal with the deficit.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg hit back, and said the Tories had to 'come clean' about closing colleges and libraries, and cutting police budgets to make their figures add up.

Chancellor George Osborne warned the Lib Dems' economic plans would wreak 'chaos' by imposing 'hefty' tax rises

The Tories are also furious that Vince Cable hailed the Autumn Statement as 'excellent' in a meeting for the Cabinet before criticising it in public.

Tensions in the coalition have mounted in the wake of Mr Osborne's mini-Budget, in which he overhauled stamp duty and targeted non-doms and foreign firms for tax rises, but also admitted dramatic spending cuts were still needed to balance the books.

The Lib Dems sought to insist scrapping the 'slab' system of stamp duty had been their policy since 2007, while also claiming credit for increasing the income tax personal allowance to £10,600.

Both parties signed up to billions of pounds in spending on roads, housing and flood defences.

But the prospect of huge spending cuts to eradicate a deficit of £91billion has caused bitter divisions.

The Tories say the money can be found entirely through spending cuts, with welfare bearing the brunt.

But the Lib Dems argue a fifth of the money can be raise through extra taxes, including a mansion tax on £2million homes.

Mr Osborne insisted the measure would do little to balance the books and the Lib Dems would have to use other hikes to make up the shortfall.

'It's hard to work out exactly what they (the Lib Dems) think,' Mr Osborne wrote in The Sunday Times.

'While they sign up to deficit reduction, they want more tax rises rather than spending cuts.

'But they shouldn't pretend to people that the sums required can be achieved by their homes tax alone.

'If you want higher taxes to do the heavy lifting, you'd also need to increase taxes like income tax or national insurance.'

Deputy PM Nick Clegg said the Tories had to 'come clean' about the impact of trying to eradicate the deficit from spending cuts alone

In a direct pitch for voters to give the Tories an overall majority in 2015, Mr Osborne insisted both Labour and the Lib Dems were a risk to the economy.

The Chancellor added: 'The battle lines for the general election have been drawn this week. There's a clear choice: a competent plan to stay on course to prosperity with us or a return to economic chaos with all the alternatives.'

However, Mr Clegg hit back, claiming it was not possible to tackle the deficit through spending cuts alone.

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'I think it is impossible to balance the books, shrink the state, deliver unfunded tax cuts and protect the public services that people treasure, supporting the police, supporting the NHS, the schools and colleges.

'I do think the Conservatives need to come clean. How many colleges will be closed? How many police need to be taken off our streets?'

With five months to go until the general election, there are increasingly bitter divisions in the coalition between the two parties.

Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts

Last week Mr Osborne claimed the Lib Dems signed up to government spending plans in private but now 'slag them off' in public.

After the Chancellor presented the details of the Autumn Statement to the Cabinet on Wednesday morning, Mr Cable described it as 'excellent'.

But later that day he said he 'did not recognise' the Chancellor's plan to eliminate the deficit and run a surplus by 2018-19.

He also said: 'We do have differences in emphasis. The Tories would like to cut spending rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable.'

'He told everyone how good he thought it was, and then went out and criticised it,' said a Cabinet source.
