The first stars twinkled into life some 100 million years later than was previously thought, new research suggests.

Data from Esa's Planck space telescope indicates that star formation began about 550 million years after the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe.

This is based on observing the universe's earliest light, and it could alter our understanding of how the cosmos as we know it today came to be.

Europe's Planck satellite has revealed the first stars were 100 million years younger than thought, nbased on data from the Planck satellite.

Before the stars began to form, described as the 'reionisation' epoch, the cosmos occupied a dark age devoid of visible light.

Reionisation refers to the way energetic ultraviolet light from the first stars split hydrogen atoms into their component protons and electrons. 

The Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago was when matter, space and even time exploded into existence. 

Previously scientists had thought that the first stars began to shine 440 million years after the Big Bang. 

The new results, still to be confirmed by further measurements, suggest that they are actually 100 million years younger.

Planck, launched in 2009, was designed to study the 'cosmic microwave background' (CMB) - the faint radiation echo left by the Big Bang - with unprecedented accuracy. It was decommissioned in 2013 after exhausting its supply of liquid helium coolant.

'According to Planck's observations, stars may be younger than believed, in bearing with other independent astrophysical indicators, and this finding may have major consequences on our attempts to understand the dark components of the universe,' said senior scientist Dr Carlo Baccigalupi, from the International School of Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy.

The 'dark components' consist of invisible dark matter and dark energy, both of which are still unsolved mysteries whose natures are unknown.

Light is polarised when it vibrates in a preferred direction, something that may arise as a result of photons - the particles of light - bouncing off other particles.

This is exactly what happened when the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation originated in the early universe.

Initially, photons were trapped in a hot, dense soup of particles that, by the time the universe was a few seconds old, consisted mainly of electrons, protons and neutrinos.

Owing to the high density, electrons and photons collided with one another so frequently that light could not travel any significant distant before bumping into another electron, making the early universe extremely ‘foggy’.

Slowly but surely, as the cosmos expanded and cooled, photons and the other particles grew farther apart, and collisions became less frequent.

This had two consequences: electrons and protons could finally combine and form neutral atoms without them being torn apart again by an incoming photon, and photons had enough room to travel, being no longer trapped in the cosmic fog.

Once freed from the fog, the light was set on its cosmic journey that would take it all the way to the present day, where telescopes like Planck detect it as the CMB.

But the light also retains a memory of its last encounter with the electrons, captured in its polarisation. 

The scientists, who report their findings in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, said more Planck data was still to be analysed that should provide a clearer picture of the evidence.

Scientists from the Planck collaboration have published the results from the analysis of these data in a large number of scientific papers over the past two years, confirming the standard cosmological picture of our universe with ever greater accuracy.

Recently, data from Planck was used to discredit the Bicep2 results, which had initially been thought to have found evidence for the cosmic inflation of the universe.

'But there is more: the CMB carries additional clues about our cosmic history that are encoded in its 'polarisation',' explains Jan Tauber, ESA's Planck project scientist.

'Planck has measured this signal for the first time at high resolution over the entire sky, producing the unique maps released today.'

Planck's polarisation data confirm the details of the standard cosmological picture determined from its measurement of the CMB temperature fluctuations, but add an important new answer to a fundamental question: when were the first stars born?

'After the CMB was released, the universe was still very different from the one we live in today, and it took a long time until the first stars were able to form,' explains Dr Marco Bersanelli of Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy.

'Planck's observations of the CMB polarisation now tell us that these 'Dark Ages' ended some 550 million years after the Big Bang - more than 100 million years later than previously thought.'

The Dark Ages ended as the first stars began to shine. And as their light interacted with gas in the universe, more and more of the atoms were turned back into their constituent particles: electrons and protons.

This key phase in the history of the cosmos is known as the 'epoch of reionisation'.

Dr Bersanelli added: 'While these 100 million years may seem negligible compared to the universe's age of almost 14 billion years, they make a significant difference when it comes to the formation of the first stars.'

In March last year, scientists believed they had glimpsed - for the first time - the rapid expansion of the universe just after the Big Bang, a theory called cosmic inflation.

But since then, the Bicep2 findings have been repeatedly called in to question, with many saying they did not show what they appeared to.

And now the final nail has been put in the coffin, as new data this month revealed that the initial finding was due to the effects of dust in our galaxy - and not cosmic inflation.

The latest revelations were made using data from Esa’s Planck satellite.  

The findings were not entirely a surprise - but will still be a disappointment for anyone holding out hope that Bicep2 was correct.

The initial results were made using an extremely sensitive detector on an Antarctic telescope.

The team thought they had found a polarisation of light that would have proved the theory of cosmic inflation.

To make sure the signal they were detecting was correct, the team subtracted the lensing effect of massive galaxies.

But at the time, some scientists said the team had not correctly accounted for interstellar dust in our galaxy.

And now, using data from the Planck satellite, which characterised dust in the galaxy, it seems this fear has been confirmed.
