Shane Warne thinks Kevin Pietersen will shine on the big stage when the pair line up for a star-studded Rest of the World team against Marylebone Cricket Club as part of Lord's 200-year anniversary celebrations.

Pietersen's England career appears to be all but over, but he will be back in the middle at Lord's on Saturday and the 34-year-old has admitted that he still hasn't given up on playing international cricket again.

Warne said at a press conference in the famous Long Room: 'KP is an absolute match-winner.

All smiles: Shane Warne has backed Kevin Pietersen to shine on the big stage at Lord's on Saturday

Showdown: Warne and Sachin Tendulkar will lead star-studded teams in Lord's' 200-year celebrations

'He is a superstar and a wonderful player. He is fantastic to watch, I'm sure he will turn it on on Saturday and smash it all over the park. He has played well over the years at Lord's in his time with England and hopefully he can do that on Saturday.'

The Australian spin-bowling legend, who has been a fierce critic of Alastair Cook's England captaincy, will lead the Rest of the World team on Saturday.

'I think you can always improve as a player and as a captain,' Warne said. 'Some people are naturally a leader and some people it doesn't suit them.

Walk: Tendulkar didn't score a century at Lord's before retiring last November

'Ask Ian Botham, one of the best all-time cricketers but he always said captaincy wasn't for him.

'You can improve but you are either a leader or you are not and if you are not a leader and you try to force something it doesn't really work.'

Sachin Tendulkar, meanwhile, will captain the MCC team. The Indian great never scored a century at Lord's during his illustrious career before retiring in November.

Star studded: Brett Lee and Brian Lara will also be part of the all-star cast at lord's on Saturday

Primed: Pietersen shared this image of his shirt and message on Instagram

He said: 'I have enjoyed my time with the family, I started practising 10 days ago and it is nice to be back in the gear and hitting a few balls - I'm still trying to find the centre of the bat.'

Tendulkar and Warne are part of an all-star cast to celebrate the 200th year of the present Lord's ground. 

The MCC team also includes the likes of Shiv Chanderpaul, Rahul Dravid and Brian Lara while the Rest of the World side features Adam Gilchrist, Muttiah Muralitharan, Virender Sehwag and Shahid Afridi.
