One of Britain's most fun homes, where you enter the living room through a slide, has been put on the rental market for £15,000 a month.

The Rainbow House was a classical four-bedroom town home which was transformed into a bright and unique design.

Its wacky layout is the work of the designer AB Rogers who, in 2009, was given the brief of converting a home into a 'magical and liberating' space where you can leave the outside world behind.

One of the most remarkable features is a large metal slide that allows access to the house's living room which has a 1960s style retro dining table 

Among the weird features in the former 'classic' four-bedroom town house is this amazing rainbow-coloured glass spiral staircase that leads to the bedroom 

The result is a four colour-coordinated floors, a central spiral staircase and a master bedroom which features a bed that rotates 360 degrees.

But the most attention-grabbing feature is the home's slide, which links a bedroom and the open-plan kitchen/living room via a trap door.

The Rainbow House, in west London's fashionable Portobello Road, has now been put up for rent for £3,500 a week.

This works out at £15,000 per calendar month, which is 20 times the average rental cost in the UK.

The appropriately named Rainbow House is located in the fashionable Portobello Road area of west London and is available to rent for £3,500 a week 

The unusual house is was designed by AB Rogers and completely refurbished in 2009 using stunning vibrant colours not normally seen inside a family home

Another interesting feature of the property,  is the master bed, pictured, which rotates through 360 degrees and can be accessed by a spiral staircase

Max Slaught, letting agent at Domus Nova, described the The Rainbow House as a 'living artwork'.

He said: 'It is a showcase of cool, contemporary design that completely defies the norms of a domestic interior environment.

'The steel slide that connects the master suite above to the sofa piazza in the living space below brings out the kid in all of us.

'In fact, the house itself is like a mechanical toy filled with movement.

'The master bed rotates 360 degrees, the slide offers a super-fast route between upstairs and down and the sofa's central section rises and falls like something from the pages of a storybook.

'Then there are the Richard Woods floors: a fantastical painted illustration of wooden boards. All I can say is, wow.'

According to Max Slaught, letting agent at Domus Nova, The Rainbow House is a 'living artwork' and 'a showcase of cool, contemporary design' 

Mr Slaught believes the house will 'bring out the inner child' in its new tenants describing the £15,000-a-month property as a 'mechanical toy filled with movement'
