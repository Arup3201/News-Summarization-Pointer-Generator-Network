A 20-year-old man is facing jail after he stole a penny farthing bicycle so he could get back home - 14 miles away.

Robert Bastin stole the bike outside a house in Honiton after Christmas drinks with his brother, a court heard.

The jobless labourer rode the stolen bike 14 miles to his flat.

The court heard that Bastin decided against returning the bike to Honiton following the theft and instead attempted to sell it on eBay.

Defence lawyer Peter Woodley told a court today: 'He was trying to get home. He had had a Christmas Day drink with his brother and it looked like a good idea.

'But a penny farthing is not the easiest thing to return to its owner.'

On his eBay listing, Bastin claimed: 'not really my thing prefer my unicycle'.

He also maintained that he had only used it three times since new.

Devon and Cornwall Police saw the listing on January 12 and placed a £75 bid on the bike.

The court heard that Bastin accepted the bid, unaware that it was an undercover police officer. He insisted that the buyer paid cash and collected the bike from his home.

Bastin was arrested and the penny farthing was returned to its owner.

Bastin, of Honiton, Devon, admitted stealing the bike while on bail for other offences. He also admitted aggravated vehicle taking and not having any insurance or licence on December 6.

Exeter magistrates court heard that Bastin was riding a motor bike at 5am on the A30 near Exeter airport at speed.

The penny farthing was one of the first ever bikes manufactured when it was introduced in 1870. 

The bicycle received its name due to its distinctive wheels which resembled Victorian penny and farthing coins.

It was invented by James Starley and was unusual because the pedals were fixed directly to the front wheel.

The penny farthing had solid rubber wheels and a very high centre of gravity - making it very unstable and difficult to ride. It also did not have brakes or suspension.

Production eventually ceased in 1878.

A new version of the historic bicycle was developed by Hawks Cycles in 2004. It features steel caliper brakes and a modern steel alloy frame costing £150.

Police said his riding was 'erratic and wobbly' and he was doing around 20mph over the speed limit before he rode through a red light and through a No Entry sign.

Police did not pursue him because they felt it would be unsafe to do so.

Later Bastin was arrested by police who discovered DNA evidence linked to the crime from a motorcycle helmet and his clothes.

Mr Woodley said the joyriding offence happened at 5am when the main road was 'relatively clear but said it was not the 'worst case of excessive speed' or dangerous driving.

He said the jobless labourer was not coping with life over Christmas after losing his job and splitting up from his partner and young child.

'He had no money and was not thinking straight,' said Mr Woodley who said the court had the power to imprison him for a maximum of 12 months.

The magistrates ordered an all-options pre-sentencing report - including custody.

Bastin was bailed to return to court next month for sentencing.
