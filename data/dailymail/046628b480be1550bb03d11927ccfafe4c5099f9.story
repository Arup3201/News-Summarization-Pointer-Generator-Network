You would probably win a couple of pints in a pub trivia bet if you asked: ‘Who is Julen Lopetegui?’ and ‘Which current Champions League team scored their fewest points in 20 years last season?’

And it’s a value-for-money poser because the answers centre on just one club: Porto.

Their ‘season horribilis’ in 2013/14 included: sacking Paulo Fonseca in March and replacing him with reserve-team manager Luis Castro, failing to get out of their Champions League group, losing a five-and-a-half-year unbeaten home record, recording their lowest total since three points for a win was introduced and ending up 13 behind title-winners and hated rivals Benfica, who also knocked them out of both domestic cups at the semi-final stage.

Julen Lopetegui's Porto have got off to a fine start to the season by winning three of their four league games

Lopetegui, now in charge at the Dragon Stadium, was a journeyman footballer — one appearance for Real Madrid, one for the Spanish national team and a handful of horrible memories at Barcelona.

In the mid-1990s, if you’d tried to sell lucky white heather to the current Porto boss he’d either have punched your lights out, or bitten your hand off.

He played nine times in a strong Barcelona era, winning just once. Worse, he was in goal for the 1994 Supercup final second-leg 5-4 defeat to Real Zaragoza in front of 70,000 dismayed Catalans at the Nou Camp and was sent off.

Two years later, he was between the sticks for Sir Bobby Robson’s Barcelona when they lost the Supercup final second-leg 3-1 to Atletico.

The low point came in the home leg of a Spanish Cup last-16 tie against Atletico when he was sent off at the Camp Nou after 13 minutes. Barcelona lost 4-1 and Lopetegui cried on the way to the dressing room.

He had some days of wine and roses, happy times with Logrones and selection for Spain’s 1994 World Cup squad, plus European football for Rayo Vallecano.

But, as with Arsene Wenger, Arrigo Sacchi and Jose Mourinho, neither a lack of playing experience nor a moderate career was a barrier to significant coaching success.

Already Lopetegui has coached some of Spain’s continuing golden generation to win the UEFA European Championship at both Under-21 and Under-19 level.

Now he’s the boss of the 2004 Champions League and 2011 Europa League winners.

Ahead of Sunday's Oporto derby against Boavista, Porto sit joint-top of the Portuguese league and lead Champions League Group H after their 6-0 hammering of BATE Borisov.

More intriguingly, the 48-year-old Spaniard is working with the youngest average-aged squad in Champions League history (just over 22-years-old) and needs to accommodate the signing of 14 new players over the summer — seven of whom are Spanish.

With his technical staff, it means that at this proud Portuguese club there are now 12 Spaniards driving its progress.

If results go awry, no question who will be first to be blamed.

‘Football is universal! I’ll ensure that there are no “nationalities” here — just good, well-taught, committed footballers all treated the same,’ Lopetegui says.

The midweek win indicates he has a gem in Yacine Brahimi, who scored a glorious hat-trick in his first ever Champions League match, having been signed from Granada.

The French-Algerian is a player to make your ticket price seem like good value. But there are more sparklers.

Ruben Neves is a 17-year-old Portuguese star in the making. As is 19-year-old Spaniard Oliver Torres, on loan from Atletico since Lopetegui was his coach with the Spain youth teams.

Right now, nothing is more imperative than establishing city dominance. Boavista have struggled this season but theirs is an upwards trajectory, having been down in the third tier because of financial problems.

Back at the top table, Porto want to make clear who is master and who is servant.

There is a treat in store for the Spanish coach. Born in the Basque Country, his Champions League group games will take him back to the new San Mames to play Athletic Bilbao.

‘(Manager) Ernesto Valverde’s work absolutely stands out there,’ says Lopetegui. ‘They deserved to qualify for this competition and going “home” to play that marvellous team in their new stadium, in front of truly great fans, is a treat.’

No need for lucky white heather now.
