Whitney Berridge, 15, died last month from a drugs overdose. It is believed she was struggling to cope with the aftermath of her mother's death two years ago

A 15-year-old schoolgirl is thought to have committed suicide because she was unable to live without her mother who was found hanged at her home two years ago.

Toxicology tests show that Whitney Berridge, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, died from a drugs overdose.

She became ill during a birthday party for another   child at her home on April 19 and died later in North Hampshire Hospital. She suffered from Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a condition that can cause the   heart to beat abnormally fast.

Whitney's death - which is not being treated as suspicious by the police - came nearly two years after her mother Shanie was found hanged on May 6,   2012, at her home in the Popley area of the town.

Yesterday her distraught grandmother Mary Gibbons, 55 - who agreed to the heart-breaking decision to switch off her life support machine - said: 'We knew she was unhappy and thinking of her mum all the time.'

When asked if Whitney took the overdose because she could not live without her mother, Ms Gibbons added: 'I think it was - I think so. She found it difficult (without her mother). We knew she was unhappy.

'I am not sure (if she could not accept why her mum did it.) She did not get over it. It was near enough two years to the day.'

She said Whitney was a 'bubbly, happy girl' who had been 'close to her mum'.  She added: 'They worked on her for four hours but they were fighting a losing battle.'

Hundreds of people gathered in Basingstoke's War Memorial Park on Monday April 28 to remember the teenager on what would have been her 16th birthday. They let off pink balloons, as it was her favourite colour

Whitney had been staying with her aunt Leigh Ann O'Leary since her mother's death.  Ms O'Leary, 27, told the Basingstoke Gazette the death of Whitney's mother hit the teenager hard and she had been trying to get counselling for her.

'Whitney and her mum were very close,' she said. 'It was the relationship you always want with your mum. When Shanie died, Whitney died with her.'

She added that Whitney had initially been in a good mood on the day she died but her demeanour changed after she received a text message.

Ms O'Leary went upstairs to see if she was OK and the teenager said she was fine. Later on she discovered her niece face down on the floor.  She said: 'I called her three times. I tapped her arm and she didn't answer.'

Whitney had been preparing to sit her GSCE exams at the Everest Community Academy and she was expected to achieve good grades.

A statement from the academy described Whitney as 'an extremely popular student with both staff and students'.

It added: 'She loved to sing and her bright, bubbly personality will be sorely missed.'

An inquest at Basingstoke into Whitney's death was told toxicology tests showed she died from a drugs overdose.

North East Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley adjourned the inquest until July.

Hundreds of people gathered in Basingstoke's War Memorial Park on Monday April 28 to remember the teenager on what would have been her 16th birthday.   They let off pink balloons, as it was her favourite colour, and lit candles and laid flowers as a tribute.
