A young woman accused of killing her sister in a car crash wept in court today as she described how their brother had died serving in Afghanistan just months earlier.

Rosie-Ann Stone, 21, allegedly caused the
 death of her sister Jennie, 28, by careless driving after they 
were both in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165 in East 
Yorkshire in February last year.

She broke down in tears as she told of how Private Gregg Stone was killed while serving abroad with the British Army in June 2012.

Stone, who arrived at Hull Crown Court with her parents and three surviving brothers, said: 'My brother Greg was in the Yorkshire Regiment, an infantry soldier in Burma company.'

She added that she and her family were all wearing red jackets given to them by Private Stone's colleagues from the 3rd Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment.

'It’s the company jacket,' said Stone. '(Gregg) was never without his. He wore it all the time.

'When he died his comrades donated their jackets in memory of him to the family. We’ve all got one.'

Jennie Stone died when her blue Peugeot 206 car smashed into a 
tree next to the A165, near the village of Fraisthorpe, on February 18.

Prosecutors
 claim Rosie-Ann pulled out of the queue on the A165 in her Vauxhall Astra to 
overtake the slow-moving lorry -  but did not see that Jennie, who was further back, 
had also pulled out to overtake the truck.

But today, Stone wiped away tears as she described how she had had no idea her sister was behind her on the road between Hull and Bridlington.

She told the jury that she had driven her 
sister’s son Charlie, now 10, to school in Skipsea earlier that morning, with Jennie also in the car.

She added that they had planned to go shopping in Scarborough and 
she had set off first to get some things from her flat in Bridlington on
 the way.

Stone claimed she had looked in her mirror to check the road was clear, before pulling out in an attempt to overtake the lorry. 

However, she suddenly felt her car collide with another vehicle, which 'skimmed' her - causing the three vehicles to be abreast in the road.

Stone added that she had instantly 'twigged' that it was her sister driving the other car.

'I saw blue and I saw (Jennie),' she told the court. 'I saw her blond hair and I twigged almost instantly.'

She added that her sister’s car had been travelling faster than hers 
when it veered in front of the lorry and crashed into the tree.

Sisters: Prosecutors say Rosie-Ann (left) pulled out of the queue in her Vauxhall Astra to overtake the truck - but did not see that Jennie (right), who was further back, had also pulled out to overtake in her Peugeot 206

'It suddenly shot across the road,' she said. 'I instantly thought the truck was going to hit her.

'I was running back down towards the tree to get to her. I saw her in the car. I was screaming.

'I tried to get near her and some people took me away. I remember screaming something about my sister.'

She added: 'I wanted to be with Jennie. Nobody was with her. She was on her own.'

When asked by Patrick Palmer, defending, about her sister, Stone said: 'She was like a mum to me when we were younger. As we got older, we were inseparable.'

Denial: Rosie-Ann Stone, pictured with two of her brothers, denies causing death by dangerous driving

Earlier in the day, the jury had heard how Stone described Jennie as a 'speed demon' in police interviews.

She had claimed her sister took risks as a driver and had been involved in a number of minor accidents.

Stone, who denies causing death by dangerous driving, told police: 'I knew she was a speed demon. I knew she was comfortable taking risks in her vehicle. I think she took a risk and misjudged the situation.'

And yesterday, lorry driver Steven Wragg told the court how he initially thought Jennie was ‘driving like a bat out of hell.’

‘I looked in my mirror and saw something flying through the air,' said Mr Wragg.

'I must have seen some sort of collision with plastic flying. I was not sure what it was.

‘It
 hit the tree very hard. There was an orange flash and a bit of smoke. I
 saw a girl running down the road. I said “That was a big one”. She 
shouted: “That was my sister”.’

The trial continues.
