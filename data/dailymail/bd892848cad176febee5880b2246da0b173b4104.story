A thrill-seeking woman has escaped with her life after swimming drunk in crocodile-infested waters at Scotts Creek in the Djukbinj National Park.

The 21-year-old Northern Territory woman had spent the day 'fishing and having drinks' at the shore and stepped into the water to cool off, despite knowing that there was a five-metre crocodile lurking nearby. 

Her friend Isha Yilmaz said she laughed when her friend jumped into the water and 'thought it was funny.'

Ms Yilmaz said she wasn't worried about her friend being attacked by a crocodile and would have had no hesitations following her into the water. 

Her friend commented that being able to drink beers and swim in the water was 'the best part of being a territorian'.  

'The water was crystal clear, I would have gone in after her. We know the area really well, we all swim in the creeks and drink a few beers up here,' 40-year-old Yilmaz told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Yilmaz, from Humpty Doo in the Northern Territory, said the pair had been enjoying a day of drinking by the creek with friends and that her friend was the first person to brave the murky waters.

Isha photographed a crocodiles footprint in the mud two months before her friend took a dip in the croc-infested water. There was a a 12 gauge shot gun shell left in the footprint

She said there were 'heaps' of people in the area and once they saw her friend enter the water, they all decided to jump in. 

'There was a family there and their young kids were in the water. They went further up the creek and I wouldn't recommend that,' she said.  

A four-metre saltwater crocodile was spotted in the area a few months ago and was killed when a rogue hunter shot it in the head.

Over 100 crocodiles were removed from Top End waterways in 2014 and sent to croc farms 

The pair have been swimming in the creek since they were kids and weren't bothered by reports that a five-metre monster crocodile had taken up residence in the area. 

'We're aware of the croc population up here and we did check it out, the water was clear.' she said.

The Northern Territory government have expressed their concern at the public interference with the crocodiles in the Northern Territory

To the shock of onlookers the man is seen fishing waist-deep in crocodile infested waters 

The Northern Territory government have expressed their concern at the public interference with the crocodiles in the Northern Territory.  

'Saltwater crocodiles can just about be anywhere at any time so I urge everyone to stay safe and Be Crocwise in and around waterways' Senior Wildlife Ranger Tom Nichols said. 

'I remind anyone heading into or near our waterways that croc danger is real, so don't risk your life.'

Last week, onlookers were left dumbfounded by the behaviour of a man, who spent 'at least 15 minutes' wading into croc-infested water at Shady Camp on the Mary River in the Northern Territory.

Jason Rogers was there fishing nearby and photographed the man in the water. He said that at the time there was a four-and-half-foot crocodile floating within 50 metres of where the man was fishing.

Initially the fisherman just stood off the shore in shallow water as he fished

Mr Rogers had been fishing from the bank before the man arrived and caught 15 barramundi before the man started out into the water.

'He was in there for at least 15 minutes. When he was out in the water you couldn't even have shouted to him to warn him that a crocodile was coming because the river was rushing so strongly. I'll never know how he didn't get eaten,' he said. 

It's believed that the man was from Darwin Mr Rogers said, and that he had fished in the area before for barramundi.
