A brutal murderer freed early from prison to kill a second time was today put back behind bars - and a judge told him: ‘You will never be released again.’

David Cook, 65, was jailed for life in 1987 for strangling a woman Sunday school teacher with a dressing gown cord in a robbery.

But he was released after 21 years of his life sentence to move to a village 100 miles away - only to kill again.

Double killer David Cook: He will now never be released from prison

Cook strangled neighbour Leonard Hill, 64, by using a TV flex in his own home during another robbery in a desperate search for cash.

A court heard the violent death of Mr Hill had a ‘chilling similarity’ to his strangulation of teacher Beryl Maynard in 1987.

And yesterday Cook was jailed for a second life term with and told there is no chance of ever getting freed again.

Judge John Griffith Williams QC told him: ‘This is the second murder you have committed.

‘The seriousness of this offence is extremely high and I have to impose on you a whole life order. You will never be considered for release.’

Evil Cook killed Good Samaritan Mrs Maynard after she befriended him while he was in prison. But he robbed and killed her at her home.

And then more than 20 years later, he befriended new neighbour Mr Hill - before robbing and killing him in a similar way.

The judge told him: ‘You are a pathological liar who will tell any lie to further your self-interest.

‘You lied after murdering Beryl Maynard and you lied after murdering Leonard Hill.

‘Leonard was an anxious and shy man. He described you as a good man just like Beryl Maynard who befriended you while you were in prison.

‘You murdered her for small gain and you took the same advantage of Leonard Hill when you needed money.

‘Leonard Hill was particularly vulnerable and you knew he could not stand up to you. You invited him into your bungalow where you killed him for gain.

Victim Leonard Hill was described in court as 'anxious and shy'

‘This was carried out in a chillingly deliberate way. He rendered him unconscious, trussed him up and strangled him.’

Cook has previous convictions for robbery in the 1980s when he tied up his victims using tape, wire and cords.

He befriended Good Samaritan Mrs Maynard, 37, while in jail for the series of robberies.

He replied to an advert for prison penpals in a Christian magazine while in jail.

On his release Mrs Maynard invited him to her home in Reading, Berkshire, for dinner.

But months later he forced his way into her house and strangled her to death before stealing her money.

He was jailed for life in 1988 for her murder - but released back into the community in 2009 on ‘life licence’ under the probation service.

Cook moved to Rhymney, South Wales, where he was befriended by next-door neighbour Mr Hill.

But he then allegedly murdered Mr Hill in a robbery after running up £5,800 of debt.

Cook ransacked his neighbour’s bungalow before hiding his body in his own home. He then went to the village pub to buy drinks with money stolen from Mr Hill.

Prosecutor David Aubrey QC said: ‘This was a brutal, determined and merciless killing.

‘When he killed Leonard Hill he had been released from prison on life licence, having been convicted of the murder of a woman in Reading in 1988.

‘He beat Leonard Hill unconscious or semi-conscious, he then bound and gagged him using a pillow case and then throttled him until he was dead.’

The court heard how he later rang his support officer Nicholas Hopkins 12 days later to say: ‘Hi Nick, it’s David here.

‘Could you give me a ring because I have done something terrible? I have killed my neighbour.’

Cook admits killing Mr Hill but denies murder. He claims he lost control and killed Mr Hill after he made a sexual pass at him by touching his genitals.

But police inquiries into Mr Hill’s background showed no history of him being gay.

They found numerous newspaper cuttings of topless models and 170 magazines containing pictures of naked women.

Mr Aubrey added: ‘Cook has a history of lying, fabrication, and deceiving others to get his own way and to cover up what he has done.

‘The suggestion that Leonard Hill had touched him was a cynical and deliberate lie to seek to excuse what Cook had done.’

A jury found Cook guilty of murder yesterday after retiring for just an hour.

Claire Burton, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales, said later: ‘David Cook has been convicted of a most horrific and violent murder.

‘Leonard Hill was a quiet, non-confrontational and unassuming man who posed no threat to anyone - least of all David Cook.

‘His murder was the calculated act of a callous and brutal attacker.

‘I would like to pay tribute to the excellent investigation work carried out by Gwent Police on this case.

‘Their thorough approach enabled us to build an extremely strong prosecution case against David Cook, leading to today’s conviction.

‘Whilst we welcome the fact that David Cook has been brought to justice, we should not forget that the family and those close to Leonard Hill, as well as all those affected by the actions of David Cook, will have to live with the consequences for years to come.’

The grieving family called for a full investigation into how Cook was handled by the probation service after being released.

Mr Hill’s sister-in-law Carol Hill said she was ‘disgusted’ at how Cook was moved next to Mr Hill and said : ‘I need lots of answers.’

Mrs Hill, who lives in Spain, said: ‘He should never have been put there.’

‘It seems Cook only had one way of dealing with any kind of problem and that was with violence.

‘There’s an inquiry going on now and it’s the probation service I desperately need them to look into.

‘I feel they are utterly responsible and they know that.’

She added: ‘The failings lie with, firstly, whoever did the risk assessment when Cook was let out of prison, because in 2008 when he escaped from an open prison he was deemed to be dangerous.

‘I need to know whether the probation services knew he had all this debt. I need lots of answers.’

Wales Probation Trust, which has ordered a serious case review, offered its ‘deepest sympathies’ to the family.

A statement added: ‘The review will look at how all the agencies in this case have worked together and will seek to identify whether there is any learning for the agencies individually or collectively in managing high-risk offenders.

‘It would be inappropriate for us to comment further until the review is completed in order not to prejudice the outcome.’
