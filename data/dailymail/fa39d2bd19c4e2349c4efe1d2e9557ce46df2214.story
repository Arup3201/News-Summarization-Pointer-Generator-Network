A father died during his son's stag night after downing a deadly cocktail of cider spiked with spirits.

Lorry driver Nigel Hamer, 46, was celebrating with his son Sean, 27, and his rugby teammates when he collapsed outside the hotel where they had been drinking.

Mr Hamer had been drinking all night when he was handed the dangerous cocktail of cider and spirits in a pint glass, an inquest heard.

After collapsing, party-goers called for an ambulance but paramedics were unable to revive the father-of-three.

Sean proceeded with his wedding eight days later - the day after his father's funeral.

Tributes: Flowers left outside the Castle Hotel, Pontardawe, South Wales, in memory of Nigel Hamer who collapsed after drinking in the hotel

The inquest heard how Mr Hamer, described as a 'hard working man', was not used to heavy drinking because of his job driving lorries across Europe.

Mr Hamer, of Swansea, South Wales, died from acute pneumonia as a result of alcohol intoxication from the stag night.

A post-mortem examination revealed he was just over three times over the legal drink-drive limit.

Tests found 261 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit for driving is 80 milligrammes.

Swansea coroner Philip Rogers said: 'Mr Hamer's average intake was 14 units per week, entirely consistent with his job as a lorry driver.

'He was a hard working man who went all across the country and Europe.

'On this particular occasion he had consumed a larger than normal amount of alcohol and sadly this has been the unexpected outcome.'

Alison Finall, consultant pathologist, said: "The fatal range for alcohol is usually between 300 and 500 milligrammes.

'He is short of that but it is very high. It would have caused a significant affect on his brain.'

Mr Hamer had joined Sean and his teammates from the village rugby team in Trebanos, near Swansea.

They were drinking in the Castle Hotel in Pontardawe, where Sean and his bride-to-be Nicola James, 24, left a touching letter following the incident headed 'You will never walk alone'.

Speaking of his decision to get married following the funeral, Sean said: 'I never imagined I'd be having to plan my father's funeral the day before my wedding.

'I had a long chat with dad just two days before it happened. I told him that I loved him. No one can take that away from me.'

Trebanos Rugby Football Club Secretary Justin Jones said: 'This has come as an absolutely devastating blow to Sean. It's just tragic.'

Mr Hamer had two other teenage children: Stacey, 19, and Jamie, 15.

The coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure.
