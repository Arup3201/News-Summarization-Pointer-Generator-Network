Sydney Cawsey was 13 year and nine months old when he worked as a cook on a merchant navy vessel during World War One.

The boat, which was mastered by his father John, would transport troops from Devon to Guernsey.

But, on March 1917, the young boy and his father were both killed when the boat was brutally shelled by a German submarine.

The pair's heroic story has come to light as medal posthumously awarded to them are to be auctioned this summer.

Sydney worked as a cook on a 172 tonne 
wooden schooner called the S.V. Reward.

The father and son were part of a crew transporting troops and coal from Falmouth in Devon to Guernsey when they came under heavy fire by a German UC-72 submarine.

Sydney received the British War Medal and Mercantile Marine War Medal posthumously and is one of the youngest recipients of the awards.

Auction: Medals awarded to Sydney Cawsey and his father John Carter Cawsey posthumously will go on sale

He was among 10 other boys aged under
15 who served in the merchant navy during the Great War.

Meanwhile John gained the Torpedo Badge medal, which he was posthumously awarded for his service on a different vessel.

The schooner, a ship with two or more masts, was built in 1878 by Troon Shipbuilding Co in Scotland.

Figures show 14,287 British merchant navy sailors died during World War One.

The deadly German UC-72 submarine downed 38 ships during the war using a deadly combination of torpedoes and mines.

Both
sets of medals, along with bronze plaques given to their relatives 
after they died, will go under the hammer at Maxwells Auctioneers in 
Stockport in July. 

Medal 
expert Andrew McCann, who is handling the sale, said: 'Only a handful of
boys Sydney's age would have served in the merchant navy.

'There has been some confusion over his age, because his descendants who gave us the lot believed him to be 15. 

'But records in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission show him to be 14.

Sydney Cawsey was awarded the British War Medal, which was a campaign medal of the British Empire, for service in World War I.

It was given to officers and men of British and Imperial forces who had served between 5 August 1914 and 11 November 1918.

It was later given to those involved in the min clearing the years afterwards.

One side of the silver disk features King George V bareheaded effigy, facing left, while the other side shows St George, on horseback with a shirt sword.

There were 6,500,000 of these medals issued.

The 13 yeah old was also given a mercantile Marine War Medal, which was as awarded by the Board of Trade of the United Kingdom to members of the Merchant Navy.

The bronze medal also features King George, but the reverse show a a merchant ship sailing through stormy seas, an enemy submarine sinking and a sailing vessel in the background.

Sydney's father John was awarded the Torpedo Badge medal for services on a different vessel during he war.

'However, when we dug further we saw that the 1911 census put his birth year as 1904, which would make him 13 years and nine months old - one of the youngest sailors in the war.

'The fact he died with his father makes it such a poignant story, because in all my years of historical study we have never encountered a similar instance.'

Sydney and John were sailing with ship's mate John Mactaggart Taylor, Dubliner Andrew McLoughlin, and Edward Campbell who was born in Barbados.

Despite the risks of attack from enemy submarines John's wife Mary Anne and his daughter would sometimes accompany them on their trips up and down the channel.

The medal collection is expected to fetch £600-£800 at auction but could reach a higher price.

Mr McCann added: 'We've put a relatively low estimate on it I would say, but with something like this the sky's the limit. 

'There are loads of medal collectors out there, and a lot with a story like this will inevitably attract a lot of attention.

'We've got them from descendants of the family, who for whatever reason feel no connection to the pieces. 

'It's surprising how common it is for families to sell off heirlooms you think would have priceless sentimental value.'

The Cawsey family experienced a huge amount of tragedy in the early 1900's.

Sydney's older brother, who shared 
his name, died in his infancy and another brother died at sea when he 
was just three years old.

John Carter Cawsey and Sydney Cawsey are both commemorated on the Merchant Navy Monument at Tower Hill, London. 

Their names are also recorded on the war memorial in their home town of Appledore, North Devon.

For King and country: Many young boys replied to Lord Kitchener's call for volunteers

While a 13-year-old boy at war was an unusual sight, World War One brought out the patriotic side of the nation. 

This led tens-of-thousands of men to answer Lord Kitchener’s call for volunteers, and to sign up at their local recruitment office.

The swell in national pride encouraged thousands of underage boys who were willing to lie about their age and identity to try and get a piece of the action.

You had to be 19 to legally sign up to go to war, if you were 18 you could enlist but not go abroad.

But, come the start of The Great War, recruitment officers took the role that it a young man wanted to enlist and was physically able to do so, then there was no reason to stop him.

It is impossible to know for certain how many boy soldiers there were during World War One, but it is thought that as many as 250,000 underage boys enlisted and went abroad.

Some young boys not only lied about their age, but their name as well.

This ensured that worried parents could not track their sons down and report them to their commanding officer.

Even gravestones in war grave cemeteries show the ‘official’ ages, or the ones that the boys claimed to be. 

It is thought that by the end of the war, many of the young boys who were so desperate to fight for King and country had been injured or killed.
