An Indiana 18-year-old man has been arrested after he was pulled over driving 135 mph in a 55 mph zone.

Yun Zhang, of Indianapolis was arrested and charged with reckless driving.

The teen was driving a 2010 Audi on the northbound 1465 when a State Trooper clocked him going more than 80 miles over the speed limit late last month.

Trooper Evan Joyner couldn't believe his eyes when on February 26 at 2:38pm, Zhang zoomed past him at an extremely high speed.

His LIDAR (light detecting and ranging radar) registered that the Audi was traveling at 135 mph, reports the Pendleton Gazette.

Joyner was posted on the shoulder of the highway working stationary traffic patrol when the teen sped past him.

Zhang's joyride was cut short when Joyner pulled him over and arrested him.

The Indiana Criminal Justice Institute reports that in 2013 there were 199 speed-related fatalities in Indiana.

Zhang was arrested and incarcerated in the Marion County Arrestee Processing Center for Reckless Driving.
