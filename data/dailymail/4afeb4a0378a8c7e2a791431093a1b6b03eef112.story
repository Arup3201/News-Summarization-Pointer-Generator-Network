A former Playboy producer who turned to God to campaign against adult movies has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a 13-year-old girl.

Pentecostal pastor Donny Pauling Jnr from Redding, California, was charged after a 16-year-old  told sheriffs the pair had been having a three-year affair.

The 41-year-old, who claims to have convinced 500 women to appear in adult films, has also been accused of having sex with another under age girl.

The alleged victim told detectives Pauling had bought her lingerie so she could pose for erotic photos. He is then believed to have posted the images on Reddit.

Allegations: Pentecostal pastor and anti-porn crusader Donny Pauling Jnr from Redding, California, was arrested after a 16-year-old woman told sheriffs the pair had been having a three-year affair

She said to officers she had sex with Pauling because she believed he would buy her things and take her on trips as a result. 

Detective Robert C. Brokenbrough said Pauling first made inappropriate comments to the first victim about her lips and bottom. He then allegedly had sex with the girl in the summer of 2014.

The officer also described how one of the victims found a recording device in Pauling's shower. When she asked what it was, he reportedly said that he wanted to know what her body looked like.

The relationship began to unravel when the victim's mother found a picture of Pauling's crotch on her daughter's phone, according to authorities. 

According to the Marysville Appeal Democrat Deputy District Attorney Anu Chopra submitted 10 photos of the girl into evidence. 

Some of the photos included the girl posing topless, exposing her bottom. Others included other minors. 

Pauling, who worked in the porn industry for nine years from 1997, was first arrested in December for having sex with a girl under 14.

But last week the Sutter County Deputy District Attorney leveled nine new charges related to a second victim.

During a jailhouse interview in December, Pauling told CBS Sacramento Sutter County sheriff's captain Lewis McElfresh Jr tried to get him to have sex with his 16-year-old family member.

He said: 'I came over to his house and he tried to get me to sleep with her. He said to me that she wanted to sleep with me.'

Pauling quit the adult film industry in 2006 and started giving speeches about the detrimental impact adult films has on women. He has made a number of television and radio appearances around the world. 

One of his most recent appearances arrest was at the St. Isadore Catholic Church in Yuba City. 

Claims: One of the alleged victims told detectives during an interview Pauling, 41, had bought her lingerie so she could pose for erotic photos. He is then believed to have posted the images on Reddit

On his personal website he says: 'Yes, I was a porn producer for 9 years, contracting with Playboy and a group of other well known companies. Yes, I have become a Christian. And yes, I now speak publicly about what goes on behind the scenes here on this blog as well as at numerous Churches and Universities (including Yale University – WOOT!) across this great country of ours. 

'But the reason I speak about what goes on 'behind the scenes' of porn is NOT because I have become a Christian. I do so because someone needs to do so. Porn is often portrayed as great fun, happy go lucky, and victimless. 

'The fantasy shown on screen seems fantastic. The realities of porn, however, are not even close. I am a firm believer in freedom of speech and expression, and it is my personal belief that education, not legislation, is what changes hearts. Therefore it is my goal to educate so that those who hear can make a more informed decision.' 

During an appearance on ABC's Nightline, Pauling had a debate with two porn stars, during which he said: 'We're intelligent human beings. And when what we're doing is costing someone else and causing pain to someone else, we probably shouldn't be doing it.'

Last year he spoke out after health expert Dawn Hawkins said pornography was behind a health crisis.

He said he has personally seen the ill effects of the porn business on the women who appear in front of the camera.

It came after Miriam Weeks, a 19-year-old women's studies student at elite Duke University,  caused a national stir recently when she came out as moonlighting Internet porn star Belle Knox.

Pauling said he doubts she feels as 'empowered' as she has claimed when she revealed her identity. 

He is currently being held in Yolo County Jail with bail set at $5 million. He has denied the charges.
