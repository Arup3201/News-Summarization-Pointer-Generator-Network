A goal in either half from Adlene Guedioura ensured Watford leapfrogged Brentford in the Championship playoff places.

The on-loan Crystal Palace midfielder helped the Hornets come from behind, including a stunning 30-yard effort, to beat Cardiff 4-2 in south Wales.

Adam LeFondre opened the scoring for the Bluebirds, before Guedioura grabbed his first and Odion Ighalo headed in Watford's second just before the half-time break.

In the second period, Guedioura netted his second and Watford's third, before Gabriele Angella made sure of the points late on. Kenwyne Jones' late goal was only a consolation, as Cardiff were booed off the pitch.

Nouha Dicko continued his impressive comeback with another goal for Wolves, as they overcame Brentford 2-1 at Molineux. 

Dicko, who also scored the winner at Watford on Boxing Day, scored after just seven minutes to put Wolves on course for their first home win since October and move them firmly back into the promotion race.

James Tarkowski's own goal doubled Wolves' lead, before a late scare when Danny Batth put the ball into his own net in the dying moments. But the Midlands side held on for all three points to move up to eighth. 

Blackpool picked up a much-needed point late on against Rotherham to nick a 1-1 draw at Bloomfield Road.

Dom Telford marked his Tangerines debut with the goal, leaving Rotherham firmly in the relegation battle in 19th.

The visitors had gone ahead through Emmanuel Ledesma, and it looked as though basement boys Blackpool would suffer 15th league defeat of the season until Telford's late strike.

Huddersfield ended Bolton's eight-match unbeaten run after Nakhi Wells' late winner at the John Smith's Stadium.

Bolton had gone 1-0 up after just 41 seconds through Darren Pratley, before former Bolton loanee Jacob Butterfield equalised just before half-time.

The game was level for the majority of the second half, until Wells' coolly finished underneath Andy Lonergan in the 85th minute to win the game for Huddersfield.

They move away from the drop zone to 18th, while Bolton drop one place to 15th.
