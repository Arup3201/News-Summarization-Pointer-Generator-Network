Southampton are looking at Serbian left-back Dusko Tosic from Turkish club Genclerbirligi as their replacement for Luke Shaw following his move to Manchester United.

Tosic, 29, had brief spells for QPR and Portsmouth and was named in the Turkish League’s all-star team last season.

Southampton are also looking to buy a goalkeeper and striker once their £12million forward Dani Osvaldo’s loan move to Inter Milan is settled.

Strong option: Tosic comfortably holds off Premier League star David Silva while playing for Serbia

Pedigree: Osvaldo vies for possession with Spain's Jordi Alba during a friendly match earlier this year

The Italy international struggled to nail down a first-team spot at St Mary's, and spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus.

Despite his Premier League struggles, Osvaldo is held in high regard in Serie A, following successful spells at Roma and Fiorentina in the past.
