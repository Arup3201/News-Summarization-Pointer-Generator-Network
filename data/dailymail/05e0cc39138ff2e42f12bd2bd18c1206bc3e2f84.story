Nemanja Vidic was given a rousing send-off by Manchester United as he said goodbye to the club he's served for eight years, claiming his heart will always be at Old Trafford.

The central defender was handed a present by Sir Bobby Charlton before Ryan Giggs' side played Hull City on Tuesday night.

And even though the 32-year-old started on the bench at Old Trafford, he did get a run out in his final home game for the Reds.

Surprise: Vidic started on the bench against Hull City but came on after an injury to Phil Jones

Phil Jones left proceedings after picking up an early injury, which threw the Serbian on earlier than expected.

Giggs had planned to give Vidic his standing ovation later on as United fans caught a final glimpse of a man who has been a terrific servant for the club since joining from Spartak Moscow in 2006.

And he was emotional when the time came to say goodbye.

'Physically I will leave but my heart will always be at this club. I've spent so many years here,' Vidic said.

'I've worked with so many great people and will always watch and care about United.

'It was a tough season. It has been a tough night - it was very emotional.

He won five Premier League titles, the Champions League and three League Cups under previous manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

But as United changed under David Moyes, certain players became surplus to requirements.

While there would have been very little resistance to Vidic penning a new deal for at least another year, he felt the time was right to jump ship.

Giggs said afterwards: 'Nemanja goes with all our best wishes of success in the coming years.'

See you soon! Vidic applauds the supporters and said his heart would always be with the club

Writing in the matchday programme, he said: ‘Thank you for all the support you have given me over the years. I know I will be supporting the club in the future.

‘You never know what's going to happen with emotions. You can try to predict but I wasn't emotional before and I haven't cried yet.'

Vidic admits the lap of the pitch won't be the same without a trophy but that it is 'the least the players can do' to thank the supporters.

He said: 'As we didn't do well this season, that walk around Old Trafford won't be the same after many years where we have always been celebrating something after the final game. Now, it has become a chance to thank the fans for supporting us this year. I think this is definitely the least that we can do.

'We must perform in these last games to give them something to look forward to next season and to believe this team can win again. That is what the players are thinking about now - to try to put on good performances and build on that next season.'
