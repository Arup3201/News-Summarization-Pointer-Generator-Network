Dozens of teenagers turned out to a vigil on Wednesday evening to pay tribute to three classmates who died in a tragic car crash.

Ohio state troopers are investigating the accident that claimed the lives of Wesley Culpepper, 15, Daniel Tittle, 17, and Charles Luthe, 16, at 5.30am on Wednesday morning.

Hours after the crash, friends of the teens, who were all students at Tecumseh High School, in Springfield, Ohio, attended a vigil, held behind the school.

Wesley Culpepper was the youngest victim, aged 15, his father remembers him as a lover of the outdoors

A spokeswoman for Ohio State Patrol said it is not yet know which teen was driving the Hyundai Sonata or who the vehicle belonged to.

Officers say it may be weeks before they can give definitive answers as to why the car flew off the road and crashed into a tree with enough force to split the vehicle in half. All three teens died at the scene.

Lieutenant Brian Aller, commander of Ohio State Patrol's Springfield base, told the Dayton Daily News: 'I’ve seen some bad crashes, but to have the vehicle split the way it is, it definitely involves high speed and just some very careless, reckless driving.'

The teens' school is currently on spring break but the district will be providing councilling for any students who need support.

Jeff Culpepper, Wesley Culpepper's father, told WTDN he will remember his son as an active young man.

He said: 'Wesley loved the outdoors. He was a country boy. He liked to wear his cowboy hats and his cowboy boots.

'I thought that they might have been fishing or camping out. That’s about all I know that the boys were going to spend the night and they probably had a camp fire somewhere.

'I know there’s a million thoughts going through my head, different moments and sometimes I can be strong and sometimes I’m really weak and break down.'

Officers believe the car was driving at high speeds - well above the 55mph limit - when it veered off the road

It could be weeks before the investigation provides definitive answers as to what caused the accident

Investigating officers have said the speed will have played a key role in the accident - the car is thought to have been going well over the 55mph speed limit - and Mr Culpepper wants teenagers to take a lesson from the tragic event.

He said: 'I want them to know to slow down and be careful and just because there’s two or three kids in the car, don’t egg each other on, don’t egg the driver on, don’t get excited about going fast. I mean it’s serious on the road and life is fragile.'

Tributes have flooded in for the boys, both left at the tree where they crashed and also online.

Writing on an online memorial, a friend of Charles Luthe's, identified only as John, said: 'For someone only 16, he was remarkably open, honest, and hard working.

'He was a delight to be around and kept me laughing. May I extend my deepest sympathies to his parents Suzanne and Gary as they struggle with the loss of their son.

'He will be missed by all who knew him. Because of his smile, he will be missed by those who'd only met him.'
