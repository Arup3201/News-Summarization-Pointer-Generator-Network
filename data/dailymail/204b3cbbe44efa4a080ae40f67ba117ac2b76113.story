Defence chiefs are trying to recruit more Muslims into the army after the rise of Islamic State and massacre in Paris, it has been revealed.

Troops have posted pamphlets on British military values through the doors of Islamic religious schools and have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers.

The drive comes after it emerged there are just 480 Muslims serving in the British army - 0.5 per cent of the 88,500 overall troops.

Drive: Troops have posted pamphlets on British military values through the doors of Islamic religious schools and have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers.

By contrast, more than twice as many British Muslims were believed to have travelled to Syria to fight for extremists including the Islamic State.

And the percentage of Muslims in the UK population overall is much higher at five per cent. 

Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter, said: ‘My highest priority is ensuring we continue to have the best possible talent throughout our Army.

‘This requires us to draw talent from all of the society we represent.’

He said the army’s recruitment from the UK’s black, Asian and ethnic minority populations was ‘nowhere near where it needs to be’.

He added: ‘We have to do more. The Army has always played an important role in making the connection to all elements of society and there are plenty of examples of initiatives that have built enduring relationships with minority communities.’

He said there was ‘common ground’ between the values of the army and those in minority communities and the military could build on that ground to broaden their recruitment base.

As well as young Muslims, the British army is also trying to recruit people from all ethnic minorities.

This year the army will participate in ten events across the UK each month, focused on engaging with these communities.

Currently 9,100 – just over 10 per cent - of the strong regular army is drawn from these communities.

Islamic State: There are just 480 Muslims serving in the British army. By contrast, more than twice as many British Muslims were believed to have travelled to Syria to fight for extremists last summer

But the UK’s ethnic population is growing and is expected to reach 30 per cent of the total in the coming decades.

A defence source said ‘talent must therefore be attracted from this population’ as the figures show ‘that UK ethnic minorities are under-represented in the army’.

They added: ‘Diversity in all its forms drives change and can be a key factor in organisational agility.

‘This agility is key for an Army facing evolving and hybrid threats.’

The Ministry of Defence is working to develop better mutual understanding between the army and minority communities, it was said.

One initiative to recruit more Muslims included a warrant officer and recruiter in the North West who had been trying hard to recruit in Asian and Muslim communities – but without great success.

This was until he started posting a copy of British Army values through the doors of madrassas- the Arabic term for schools – in Burnley.

This resulted in the director of the school asking the officer if he would come round for a cup of tea and then realising they had many shared values.

Another initiative the army has been engaged in involved army officers integrating mixed-race members of the community by building off-road ‘warrior buggies’ with them.

The scheme sees students attending weekly sessions at the local Territorial Army base at Swinton, Manchester, where they learn basic engineering and mechanical skills, as well as the building of team skills.

There will also be a focused campaign to target different ethnic communities across the UK during the coming year, which will feature across social and digital channels supported by events.

The Army has also launched the Armed Forces Muslim Forum, designed to bring the civil and military Muslim communities together.

Another initiative includes the army working in partnership with the Shah Jehan Mosque and the people of Woking to create a Muslim Peace Garden that commemorates Muslims serving in the Armed Forces.

Next week British soldiers of different faiths, including British Muslim soldiers, will plant trees as part of the project.

A source added: ‘With improved understanding the Army is seeking to build bonds with the whole nation it serves.

‘Myths need to be dispelled and more ethnic minorities should be encouraged to look at careers in our Regular Army, Army Reserve and at volunteering opportunities with the Army Cadets.’

Muslims in the UK armed forces are able to pray five times a day and fast, as long as there is not an overwhelming operational requirement against either.

They are provided with halal rations, can seek support from Muslim chaplains, and use prayer rooms on base – one of which was recently made available on a naval warship.

Figures show that half of ethnic minorities currently in the UK are Asian and 50 per cent of the Asian population are non-Muslim. The army is trying to recruit from all sectors of society
