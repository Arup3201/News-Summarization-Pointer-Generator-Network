A private intelligence outfit which helps defence firms and paid for Adam Werritty’s jet-set lifestyle has doubled its profits since Liam Fox became a minister.

G3 Good Governance Group gave £15,000 to Pargav Ltd, the company set up by Dr Fox’s best man and former flatmate, which helped fund his globetrotting and extravagant spending.

The revelations prove a direct link between the defence industry and Mr Werritty’s globetrotting with the Defence Secretary.

Dr Fox’s allies tried to say that Mr Werritty’s backers were ideological allies of the Defence Secretary.

But it is another example of  how some of them had commercial interests in the defence industries – a fact which made his position untenable.

G3’s accounts show that the firm has enjoyed huge commercial success over the last two years.

After making a loss of £33,026 in 2009, between 2010 and 2011 it doubled its turnover from £6million to £12million and raised its profits from £1.3million to £2.4million.

G3 works hand in glove with a firm named C5 Capital, which describes itself as ‘an independent investment company, focusing on the global security sector’.

One of C5’s employees is Lt General Sir Graeme Lamb, the former director of UK Special Forces.

On C5’s website the firm reveals: ‘We are closely associated with the Good Governance Group, which includes G3, a leading strategic advisory consultancy.

‘Through G3, we have unparalleled access to in-depth sector knowledge and to an extensive network of specialist advisers.’

Funded by tycoons: Jet-set spending of friend who was always at minister's side

G3 and C5 work so closely together that they are based in the same London premises, 40 George Street in Marylebone.

The two companies also share a director, Andries Pienaar, a South Africa-born security expert, who was once a managing director of the secretive private intelligence company Kroll.

Eric Morris, G3’s geopolitics specialist, once taught at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.

G3 said it gave money to Mr Werritty’s company because it had believed the donation of £15,000 was ‘intended to go towards charitable work’.

But it ended up paying towards Mr Werritty’s stays in  five-star hotels around the world, first-class flights, lavish meals and even £2,000 suits.

G3 also funds what it describes as a ‘charitable organisation’ – Universal Exports Charity Foundation, which is named after the company used as a cover for MI6 in the James Bond films.

Universal Exports Charity Foundation is administered and run by Laura Tantum, who Sky News reported to be the daughter of Geoffrey Tantum, a former MI6 Middle East director.

In a further twist, it emerged that the address at 40 George Street was formerly used by the Sri Lanka Development Trust, a group which Dr Fox helped to set up.

The trust, along with the Sri Lankan government, paid for Dr  Fox to fly to Sri Lanka on three occasions. Its chairman is Chester Crocker, a former assistant secretary of state under Ronald Reagan.

The trust was designed to help Sri Lanka rebuild its infrastructure following the civil war, using private finance and charitable projects.

But Dr Fox’s involvement led to irritation in the Foreign Office, which has tried to keep its distance from the regime in Colombo accused of brutality against the Tamil minority.

Despite this collection of security and defence groups using the same address, G3 has categorically denied any involvement with the Sri Lanka Development Trust or Liam Fox.

On Thursday, a spokesman explained away the connection as a ‘coincidence’ and claimed to have no knowledge of who operated from the premises before G3.

The Mail attempted to contact G3 yesterday but no one was available for comment.

Other Pargav sponsors appear to include Michael Lewis, a millionaire with close links to Israel who helped fund Dr Fox’s Tory leadership campaign in 2005.

The 52-year-old investor was  vice-chairman of Bicom until 2007, and last night insisted he was ‘not connected with globetrotting by Fox and Werritty’.

Disappointed: Poju Zabludowicz says he was tricked into funding Werrity's globetrotting

One of Adam Werritty’s billionaire backers claimed yesterday that he was tricked into funding his globetrotting with Liam Fox.

London-based Poju Zabludowicz – a former arms dealer who owns much of Las Vegas and helped bankroll David Cameron’s campaign to become Tory leader – was said to be ‘extremely disappointed’ to discover the truth about Mr Werritty.

Mr Zabludowicz, 58, heads the Tamares Group of investment companies, based in Liechtenstein. The firm paid £3,000 to Mr Werritty’s company Pargav Ltd, which funded his first-class travel to meet Dr Fox on lavish foreign trips.

Jonathan Hawker, a spokesman for Mr Zabludowicz, said: ‘He is just extremely disappointed. He is now learning that his money was not all used in the way he thought it was.

‘He is passionate about promoting dialogue to promote the Middle East peace process, and he donated £3,000 a year to [Mr Werritty’s  other company] Security Futures  for that purpose.

‘Then his office had a call from Werritty saying his annual contribution was due, and that the invoice would be from Pargav Ltd but that it was effectively the same thing. He took it at face value.’

In 2005, Mr Zabludowicz’s firm paid £15,000 to Mr Cameron’s campaign to lead the Conservative Party, and last year donated £131,805 to the party itself. Tamares is said to own approximately 40 per cent of the property in downtown Las Vegas, including numerous casinos, plus property in Washington DC and New York’s Times Square.

Mr Zabludowicz fiercely guards his privacy and does so with much success despite counting Madonna and other A-list celebrities among his close friends. His wife Anita, 50, is a  renowned art collector,

The billionaire’s father Shlomo was an Auschwitz survivor who moved to Finland and built up the Israeli arms company Soltam. After Shlomo’s death in 1994, his son took over the business and sold most of the defence interests in favour of property. However, he is still chairman of a U.S. firm which manufactures ammunition for the military.

Mr Zabludowicz, worth an estimated £2billion, is also a key  figure in Bicom, the British Israel Communications and Research  Centre, which is the UK’s major pro-Israel lobby and one of the common threads running through Mr Werritty’s network of political friendships.

Mr Hawker added: ‘For many  years, Poju Zabludowicz has helped fund not-for-profit organisations, not individuals... [to] promote  peace and understanding  between the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.’
