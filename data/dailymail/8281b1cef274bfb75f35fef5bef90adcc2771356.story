Alex Comley fell ill during a family holiday to the Sonesta Beach Resort in Egypt

A holidaymaker has launched legal action after his family getaway to Egypt turned into a nightmare when he contracted salmonella.

What's more, when he returned to the UK, Alex Comley's illness was allegedly deemed so severe he was unable to return to work as a pilot for EasyJet.

Comley, 33, from Bracknell, Berks, booked a 10-day break to Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in July with tour operator Thomson Holidays with his wife Louise, 36, and two-year-old son Sebastian.

However, the all-inclusive trip, which cost nearly £2,000, was ruined only four days after they arrived when Alex was struck down by the bug at their four-star resort.

He claims his illness became so serious that after returning home he needed medical treatment and was unable to return to work  for EasyJet for more than a month.

He said: 'We were all very excited about the trip abroad as it was the first family holiday since my son Sebastian was born.

'We had planned on doing so many 'firsts' and really wanted Sebastian to have a wonderful time on his holiday and enjoy spending some real quality time together as a family. However the holiday turned into a nightmare.' 

On the fourth day he woke up with crippling stomach pains and was in agony for the rest of the holiday, suffering with vomiting and diarrhoea. 

'I have never been so unwell. I couldn't be away from the toilet for any extended periods as I was so ill so I was basically trapped in a hotel room for nearly the entire time. 

'I had only eaten in the hotel as it was an all-inclusive holiday, so I must have eaten something there to cause the problems.' 

The Sonesta Beach Resort in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt is a four-star resort, but Alex Comley believes his holiday there caused him severe illness

An appointment with the doctor on his return home apparently confirmed that he had contracted a serious strain of salmonella food poisoning and couldn't return to his job for more than four weeks. 

Alex, who says he hasn't received an apology from the firm, has instructed law firm Slater & Gordon to launch a legal case against Thomson Holidays. 

Richard Duxbury, a specialist travel lawyer from Slater & Gordon, representing the Comleys, said 'This was meant to be a relaxing family getaway but instead the holiday was ruined when Mr Comley was left extremely ill due to what we believe was entirely avoidable poor hygiene at the resort.

Mr Comley alleges that he contracted his illness after eating food in the hotel restaurant

'The restaurant for the guests was clearly not of an acceptable standard which ultimately resulted in Mr Comley becoming very ill.

'The salmonella not only ruined the holiday but has already left him unable to work due to persistent tingling, pins and needles to his hands and feet.'

In a statement, Thomson Holidays said: 'We are sorry to hear of Mr Comley's experience during his trip to Egypt. As this case is now subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further. 

'The ultimate priority for Thomson is the health, safety and comfort of all our customers. We operate stringent health and hygiene procedures in line with industry standards.' 

MailOnline Travel have contacted Sonesta Hotels and are awaiting a comment.
