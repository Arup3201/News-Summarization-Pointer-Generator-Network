The housing market may have taken some knocks over the past few years, but this terraced house is a particularly extreme victim of the crash.

The two-bed home in Burnley, Lancashire is the cheapest house in Britain, on sale with a starting price of just £1,000.

But while that may seem like an unbeatable bargain, buyer beware - the property is so delapidated that it will take thousands of pounds to make it liveable.

Bargain? This run-down house in Burnley is on sale with a starting price of just £1,000

Needs work: The house is described as 'in need of complete refurbishment' by its estate agent

Estate agents marketing the house have done their best to lower expectations, admitting the home is 'in need of complete refurbishment'.

The stone house in Dall Street, Burnley Wood, has been unoccupied for four years and its interior has been almost completely stripped out.

The windows are boarded up with metal sheets to keep out intruders.

It is being auctioned off in Preston on Wednesday, but has already attracted online bids pushing up its price to £5,000 - which still makes it Britain's cheapest home.

Renovation: It will cost thousands of pounds to restore the gutted house to a liveable state

Damage: The house's windows are all either broken or boarded up to keep out intruders

Back entrance: The other side of the house is equally rundown and in need of work

In addition, the successful bidder will 
have to pay a buyer's premium of £5,000, significantly pushing up the 
price of the property.

In July 2011, a similar house just a mile away in Burnley was sold to builder Darren McGaughey for £10,000, who estimated that it would cost around twice that much to renovate.

Five years ago, two-bedroom terraced houses in the area were hard to find for less than around £35,000.

Former councillor Karen Heseltine, from the Dall Street residents' association, welcomed the sale of the house on her street, saying: 'I am pleased that the building will hopefully be brought back into use.

Listing: The estate agents apparently do not have high hopes for the sale of the property

Neighbourhood: The Burnley Wood area has 'improved a lot' over recent years, according to a resident

Damage: The new owner will have to contend with water damage as well as the house's other problems

'It has been derelict for so long that it has caused lots of problems for the community. It has been plagued by fly-tipping and pigeons in the loft. It has been a real pain.

'For years residents have had to put up with it being an eyesore and with anti-social behaviour, so we are pleased to hear that somebody is hopefully going to take it on.'

She added: 'We want somebody who has got the time and money to turn it into a complete house again.

'We have had enough people in the area buy a cheap house and then either run out of money or run out of interest, and we are back to square one again.

'Burnley Wood is like a different place over the last five years. It has improved a lot and the community is really coming together now.'

Burnley was traditionally a mill town which thrived during the Industrial Revolution but has suffered since the decline of manufacturing.

It was first recorded in the 12th century, during the Norman period, when it was a farming centre, but its economy and population began to boom with the arrival of cotton mills and the canal.

At its peak, the town's population was more than 100,000, but it has now fallen to around 70,000 after the end of industrial activity in the area.

Well-known people from Burnley include actor Ian McKellen, Shameless creator Paul Abbott and England cricketer James Anderson.

The town is perhaps most famous for Burnley Football Club, which has twice been the national champion and counts Prince Charles among its supporters.
