West Ham co-owner David Sullivan believes the club can compete with the best and target a top-six finish in the Premier League next season.

The club struggled in a relegation battle for much of the 2013/14 campaign, with Sam Allardyce's position as manager under threat.

But when confirming Allardyce was to stay, Sullivan and David Gold said that they were aiming for the top 10.

Up for the challenge? Sam Allardyce was under pressure at the club, who were in a relegation battle in 2013/14

And in fresh developments, Sullivan now says he wants to look beyond the top half the table and kick on with some new signings.

'We start next season with three competitions, two of which we can win and we have to be dreaming of winning the third one,' Sullivan told the Evening Standard.'I don’t want to just aim for top 10. We should be aiming for top six. I want to be looking down the table not up it next season.'

The Hammers had to look to the loan market in January to improve a depleted squad, and Sullivan also admitted that many players were lined up, especially those for the future.

'We have got five or six players lined up,' he said. 'Most are young players — the youngest is 19 but has already played top-level football in two countries, while the oldest is 27.
