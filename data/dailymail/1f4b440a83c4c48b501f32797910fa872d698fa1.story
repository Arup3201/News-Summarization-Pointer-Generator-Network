The body of 30-year-old David Messerschmitt was discovered at The Donovan hotel in DC last week

Police appear baffled by the case of a young lawyer found stabbed to death in a hotel just five blocks from the White House with few leads emerging a week after his brutal murder.

The body of 30-year-old David Messerschmitt was discovered at The Donovan on February 10 - 24 hours after his wife, Kim Vuong, reported him missing.

Detective Paris White told Daily Mail Online today that theft was not considered a motive because all of the victim's valuables, including his wallet, were left at the scene.

Mr Messerschmitt's wife was not a suspect in his murder, he confirmed. 

The lawyer had texted his wife  on February 9 at around 7.30pm saying he would return home in a hour - but never did.

The couple, who married in 2012, lived together in an apartment just three miles from The Donovan. 

Ms Vuong was not aware her husband was at the hotel when he sent the text message and could provide no other details of his plans that day, Detective White said on Tuesday. 

The DC Metropolitan detective said that the investigation was 'looking at everything' surrounding Mr Messerschmitt's murder, including his work as a lawyer.

Authorities released images from surveillance footage showing a 'person of interest' at the hotel last Monday evening, the night before Mr Messerschmitt's body was found

His laptop has been seized and investigators were trawling for clues, including his social media accounts, Fox reported.  

Mr Messerschmitt was found partially clothed and with multiple stab wounds in a 4th-floor room at 11am  last Tuesday after his wife reported him missing in the early hours. 

Authorities released surveillance footage showing a dark-clothed 'person of interest' walking into the hotel and impatiently waiting for a lift before walking up the stairs.

The images were recorded inside the hotel around 7.45pm on Monday.

Police could offer no updates on that person of interest to Daily Mail Online on Tuesday. It is unclear if the figure, dressed in a dark clothes and a hooded jacket, was a man or a woman.  

Police have asked for help identifying the person and have offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

Mr Messerschmitt, whose family lives in Cincinnati, graduated from Ohio State University in 2006 and from the Boston University Law School in 2009.

Before taking the stairs, the unidentified person waited impatiently for an elevator at the hotel around 7.45pm

After leaving college, he interned with Susan Dlott, a judge for the U.S. District Court Southern District of Ohio in Cincinnati, the Enquirer reported.

'He was a star, an absolute star,' she told the newspaper. 'I'm just so sick about this. He was the nicest, most wonderful kid you could ever want to meet.'

In April 2014, he joined DLA Piper in Washington, D.C., where he worked as an associate.

His biography for the firm describes him as an intellectual-property attorney who negotiated commercial and technology agreements, the Post reported.

Josh Epstein, a spokesperson in the New York office, said the company was cooperating with police.

'This is an extremely tragic situation and we send our sincere condolences to David’s family,' Epstein said.

Gary Meltz, a spokesperson for the family, also released a statement last week and asked for privacy.

'We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of David, our beloved husband, son, and brother,' the family said in the statement.

'We ask anyone who has information about this crime to please contact the Washington, D.C. Police Department at 202-727-9099.'
