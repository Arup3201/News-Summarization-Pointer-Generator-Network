The funeral has taken place of a five-year-old boy whose mother has been charged with his murder.

Scott Chiriseri was found injured at his home in Alva, central Scotland on December 5 and pronounced dead at the scene. 

Around 200 people who gathered at a service in the town today were told about his love of motor racing and how he was an expert at the Mario Kart computer game.

Mourners were led out of the church after the service by Scott's father, Tichakunda Chiriseri, and his sister, Natasha.

Scott was found dead with what police described as a 'significant injury' at his home. His mother, Farai Chirashi, 32, has been charged with his murder and detained at a psychiatric unit. 

Rev Fraser said today that family and friends had come together to celebrate the young boy's life.

'We remember the life of Scott. You know that Scott loved life; if you close your eyes and you picture Scott, there is the young man we will see again. He loved life, he enjoyed his life,' he said.

'So happy on the first day of primary one. So happy. Well loved by all of his friends.'

He added: 'He would come into the room and it was like "I'm here now". Running along, in our church, in the Baptist church down the road, the sound of life when he's present.

'He excelled at his work and he was happy to do well. Did you know that he loved motor racing? Like his dad. Sitting alongside watching that sport.'

He told them Mario Kart was Scott's 'expert hobby' and that was why a picture of the character was on the front of the order of service below a photo of the smiling five-year-old.

Rev Fraser added: 'It was his fun pursuit that he would have beaten anyone in the room at. When they brought out a new game and the adults were trying to figure it out, there's this little boy saying "Here's how it works, let me show you".

'He loved his church. This is the boy that we are remembering, the fullness of life pouring out of him.'

The hymns What A Friend We Have In Jesus and Jesus' Love Is Very Wonderful were sung before the coffin was carried from the church to the sound of Jerusalem Our Home, sung in the national language of Zimbabwe.

A collection was also made in aid of the Children's Ministry of Alva's Baptist church, in memory of Scott.

Floral tributes were left outside the church, with one message reading 'from the Alva community'.

Flowers from the family were accompanied by the message: 'Beloved Scott. You are missed by all of us'

Mourners lined the streets of the small town as the funeral cortège made its way along the main road

After the service, many stood silently in the town's Stirling Street as the funeral procession made its way to Alva Cemetery.

Farai Chiriseri, also known as Chirashi, was charged with murder and assault following the child's death.

The 32-year-old was held under mental health legislation following a hearing at Alloa Sheriff Court on December 9.

She appeared in the same court in private last week where the sheriff made a treatment order. No further court date was set.
