Missed: Tyrone Jones died after falling off a wall while trying to climb into his holiday apartment in Benidorm

A British man fell to his death on the last day of a holiday in Spain as he tried to get into his apartment after locking himself out.

Father-of-four Tyrone Jones, 42, had lost his key and tried to get into the Benidorm flat by stepping on to a wall, unaware of a four-metre drop on the other side.

The top bricks of the wall were loose and he toppled over, suffering fatal head wounds.

His grieving relatives believe he lay on the ground for up to five hours before he was seen.

Mr Jones, known as Ty, had been in Benidorm on a two-week holiday with a friend.

The
motor trader from Exeter, Devon, was taken to hospital and treated in 
intensive care but died without having regained consciousness.

Hie was the eldest son of David and Margaret Jones, who had flown to Spain to be at his bedside.

David Jones, also from Exeter, said: 'It was the last day of the holiday 
and it seems Ty had been out and was returning to his apartment in the 
early hours of the morning.

'He
had mislaid his keys and to reach his apartment he had tried to gain 
entry by stepping up on to a wall, not knowing there was at last a 
four-metre drop on the other side.

'The top course of bricks were loose causing him to topple and fall and he suffered severe head injuries.

'There were no witnesses and it appears he lay there on his own for about five hours before he was spotted.'

Mr Jones died on February 13 - a day after his parents arrived in Spain.

His father said: 'We were just talking about arranging
to pick him up from the airport the next day when we got the call out 
of the blue about the accident.

'We finally got to the right hospital and Ty was in intensive care on life support.'

Some of Mr Jones's organs were donated and helped transform the lives of three people, his family said.

David Jones said: 'Nothing more could have been done for him.

'The surgeons asked if Ty had considered organ donation and we said he had.

'Margaret and I discussed it and said
yes and we later found out that he had helped to save three people 
having donated his kidneys, pancreas and liver.

'It helped a little to 
know that.'

Mr Jones's parents were joined in Spain by his three eldest children - Anna, 21, Nathan 17 and Charlie, nine.

The man's death was initially treated as suspicious, but a local judge later spoke to the family and told them it appeared to have been an accident.

David Jones said: 'He saw us in chambers and spoke to us for about 90 minutes.

'He was nearly reduced to tears and 
said that as a father himself, if it was his son he would have to accept
that it was a tragic accident and try to move on.'

Mr Jones's body was released for cremation and a family service was held in Spain.

His relatives then brought his ashes back to Exeter, where a memorial service for 300 people was held to celebrate his life.

Sister Susannah said in a tribute: 'Ty's beaming smile, easy manner and charisma assured him of many friends.

'He loved socialising with his many friends, knowing someone wherever he went.

'He was always up for a party and often danced until dawn.'

Mr Jones went to schools in Exeter before completing an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering at Exeter College.

He became a manager at a tyre firm before branching out into the motor trade.
