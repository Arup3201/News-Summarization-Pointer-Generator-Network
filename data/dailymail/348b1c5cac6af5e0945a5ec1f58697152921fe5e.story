Paramedics were called to a drunken Shakespeare show performed by Sussex University students

Paramedics were called to help student actors who had more than their fair share of Dutch courage before a Shakespeare performance, which saw them staggering on stage and smashing up the set.

The boozed-up thespians, members of the Sussex University Drama Society (SUDS), had deliberately downed drinks just minutes before their show which featured scenes from Macbeth and A Midsummer Night's Dream.

One audience member told The Badger, the student newspaper for Sussex University: 'I saw Lady Macbeth smash a glass jug on the ground.'

Others reported the director had to take one actor off stage after he entered at the wrong scene, during the show at a bar in Falmer, East Sussex.

The opening night sold 100 tickets and seemed popular with the audience, with one member calling it 'really impressive and entertaining.'

But the booze-fuelled show was cancelled after the second night when an ambulance was called for an actress in her early 20s.

A message on the Sussex University Drama Society Facebook page said the cast and crew were 'devastated' by the decision to cancel the show, and added: 'The decision was taken understandably by Falmer Bar after some of the drunk actors got out of control, putting their safety at risk.'

'We never want to place Falmer Bar in that position.'

An investigation has been launched by the Students' Union.Â 

Society President Jacob Jackson and publicity officer Rachael Welsh have both stepped down from their positions.

Kit Bradshaw, communications officer for the University of Sussex Students' Union, said: 'SUDS staged a show in Falmer Bar on the University of Sussex campus on Monday, 19 November and Tuesday, 20 November.

'Due to a number of incidents during those performances, the final night's show, due to take place on Wednesday, 21 November, was cancelled.

'The Students' Union has launched a full official investigation into the matter and therefore it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage.'
