Foolish: Mitchell Gough, 24, led police on a high speed chase through residential streets as he drove to his driving test in a powerful BMW

A learner driver led police on a high speed chase in a powerful BMW -  while travelling to his driving test.

Plant fitter Mitchell Gough, 24, was pulled over by police officers as he travelled to the test centre in Gloucester.

But a court heard that the father-of-one 'panicked' and decided to drive off at speed.

During the pursuit, Gough raced around residential areas on the outskirts of Gloucester for eight minutes with police officers in pursuit.

He sped through red lights without stopping and reached 70mph over speed bumps and in 30mph zones.

Finally, he drove into a cul-de-sac where he jumped out of the moving car and ran off after it crashed into a parked vehicle.

At Gloucester crown court, Gough, from Quedgeley, 
Gloucester, admitted dangerous driving, failing to stop for the police, 
having no insurance and having no MoT.

He told the court he illegally drove the BMW - which he owns -  because his mother was unable to pick him up.

When police officers - investigating reports of a stolen BMW  -  checked his number plates they found it related to another
car - Gough's father's Fiat, which made them suspicious.

Judge
Jamie Tabor QC gave him a six month jail term suspended for a year and
banned him from driving for 30 months.

Graham Wallis, defending Gough, told the court the day started badly for Gough when his mother - who had arranged to pick him up and take him to the test centre - rang to say she could not make it because her car had broken down.

'He knew he had a driving lesson at 7am, an hour before the test, and he took the impulsive and very foolish decision to drive himself to the centre,' said Mr Wallis.

'It is something that one couldn't really make up, but there you are.

'He was very anxious to take his test. I have asked him repeatedly to try to explain why he did what he did.

'There were two bad decisions. One was to get in the car at all and much worse was to take off when the police stopped him.

'It
is all the more ironic given that he is a man of good character who has
worked constantly since leaving school, has a regular job and leaves 
home every morning at 6am for his work as a plant fitter.

'All he can say is that when he was 
stopped he panicked and made a decision which was totally out of 
character. It is baffling that he behaved in this way.

Illegal: Gough was pulled over by police officers as he travelled to this test centre in Gloucester in a high-powered BMW

'He wishes to say how very remorseful he is for what he has done.'

Prosecutor Julian Kesner said police on patrol at 6.30am on April 11 had been told to look out for a stolen BMW.

They saw Gough in his BMW and decided go check it. Gough was signalled to pull in and when the officers checked his number plates they found it related to another car - Gough's father's Fiat.

As an officer was telling him to open the door and switch off the engine, Gough raced off and the patrol car went in pursuit.

He sped through red traffic lights without stopping and reached 70mph over speed bumps and in 30mph zones.

At one point, a 'stinger' was deployed by officers but Gough carried on driving until he turned into a cul-de-sac.

He flung open the driver's door and jumped out before it collided with a parked car.

Sentenced: At Gloucester Crown Court, judge Jamie Tabor gave Gough a six month jail term suspended for a year and banned him from driving for 30 months

Gough was then arrested and explained he had been on his way to take his driving test but knew that as a learner he should not have been driving alone.

'He explained to the police that as he didn't have anyone to take him to the test centre he was driving himself there,' Mr Kesner added.

In sentencing Gough, Judge
Tabor said: 'Your explanation for being in that car that day is that you were off for a driving lesson and your test having been let down by your mother's car breaking down,' said the judge.

'That is a tall story but I am prepared to believe it for the purposes of sentencing today.

'This was an idiotic decision and you are now sensible enough to realise how idiotic it was.

'But that decision was nothing like as idiotic as the next decision you made, which was to drive off when the police officers caused you to stop. '

The way Gough drove was 'highly dangerous' to other road users and it was lucky it was such a quiet time of day, the judge said.

Judge 
Tabor also fined Gough a total of 
£1,100 and ordered him to pay costs of £330.
