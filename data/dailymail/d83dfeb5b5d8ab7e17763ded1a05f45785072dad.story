Night of Thunder will revert to a mile after trainer Richard Hannon concluded his 2,000 Guineas winner ran out of stamina when only eighth of nine in Saturday’s Coral-Eclipse.

While Mukhadram, winner of the 10-furlong group one race at Sandown, is set to step up in trip in the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on July 26, Night Of Thunder will be rested before returning in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp in September.

Hannon said: ‘Before the race I was confident he would get the trip and we rode him to stay. But he didn’t really finish his race off. I think from now on it is back to a mile.’

The Moulin plan could mean clash with 
stablemate Olympic Glory, who has the Paris race on his agenda after 
first contesting the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville.

Hannon is shuffling his miler pack. 
Toronado heads for the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, Irish 2,000 
Guineas runner-up Shifting Power goes for the Prix Jean Prat while 
Toormore could bid to kick-start his season in Thursday’s Hastings 
Direct Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at Newmarket.

Hannon will run Sky Lantern in Friday’s Group One Falmouth Stakes at the track.

Clive Brittain has entered Rizeena but
 warned his Coronation Stakes winner is not a certain starter with the 
Marois also an option for the filly.

Mukhadram’s trainer William Haggas 
continued his good weekend when Frankie Dettor-ridden Graphic landed 
yesterday’s Group Three Prix Messidor at Maisons-Laffitte.

But the performance of the day was undoubtedly the easy German Derby success of Sea The Moon under Christophe Soumillon.

The unbeaten colt gave sire, 2009 
Eclipse winner Sea The Stars, a second Classic winner following 
Taghrooda’s win in the Investec Oaks.

He is now 7-1 third favourite for the Arc with Coral.
