Britain is bracing itself for a blanket of snow expected to cover much of the country by Monday night.

The wintry weather will cloak huge 
swathes of the country as two bands of rain, sleet and snow travel from 
northern Scotland to the south east of England over Monday night.

Weather warnings for ice and snow have been issued by the Met Office for large parts of the country, as temperatures are expected to plummet to -4C in some parts - including Heathrow Airport.

The warnings for today, tomorrow and Monday show the extent of the snow warnings that the Met Office have issued

Monday has been marked out as a ‘snow 
day’ by forecasters, with most of the country carpeted in at least an 
inch of the white stuff, which is expected to start falling tomorrow 
night.

The Met Office has issued a 'yellow' warning of severe weather for Wales, south and west England, north England and east of Scotland as the snow and ice hits the country.

Met Office spokesman Craig Snell said: 'There will be a band of rain, sleet and snow moving south east from Scotland on Monday, and another band of sleet and snow will be hot on the heels of it.'

Up to 5cm of snow is predicted to settle
over central and eastern England tomorrow night, with light snow 
already falling over high ground in Scotland this morning.

There have already been reports of flurries of snow in Birmingham and Luton today, but these have 'fizzled out'.

The Met has issued a snow warning for large parts of the country on Monday.

'We've got a warning out for much of Monday across a great swathe of England,' he said.

Mr Snell said that snow would fall across the country, but is not expected to reach areas below the M4.

He also warned that the weather could turn from rain in Scotland to snow in England, because of the colder air.

He warned that after Monday, the east may suffer snow flurries from the north sea, but the west of the country will be very cold and frosty.

Councils across the country have warned that many residential roads will not be gritted or cleared.

The wintry weather could cause havoc for public transport.

Train
services could face disruption because of freezing temperatures and the
threat of snow setting, according to Network Rail.

Meanwhile, Manchester Airport said it was ‘on alert for 
snow’ and Heathrow and Gatwick Airport said there was ‘a possibility’ of disruption 
on Monday, depending on the levels of snowfall and temperatures.

A spokesman for Heathrow Airport said: 
'The airport is in constant discussion with airlines and the Met Office 
about the weather, so they can be as prepared as possible.'

In December, less than an inch of snow caused five airports, including Stansted and Luton, to close.

And three inches of snow led Heathrow Airport to cancel half its flights last February.

But it admitted council gritters and snowploughs could not clear every street.

A spokesman said: ‘In the side roads 
which aren’t gritted by councils, drivers will need to be extra 
careful.’

The AA warned three-quarters of motorists were not ready for 
the weather this weekend – with those in London the least prepared.

The RAC said it is expecting up to 
56,000 breakdowns and widespread disruption on the roads which could 
hamper millions of motorists if the expected snow arrives over the 
weekend.

It has placed extra patrols on 
stand-by to help stranded motorists and said call-outs are expected to 
rise by 20 per cent or more.

A spokesman said: 'In the event of 
heavy snow, the RAC is urging motorists to avoid all non-essential 
journeys as there is a risk Britain's road network could grind to a 
halt.'

RAC roadside operations manager Matt 
Dallaway said: 'We know from bitter experience that the UK's roads 
struggle to cope with a sudden burst of snowfall.

'The RAC could be dealing with in excess of 11,000 breakdowns on Monday if there is widespread snow.

'We would advise motorists to check 
the weather forecast and think very carefully about whether their 
journey is essential before setting off, particularly if they're 
planning to travel a long distance.

'Even half an inch of snow can bring 
roads to a standstill and leave drivers stranded in their cars.'

Tesco said its sales of shovels are up more than five times last week's levels and expects them to increase even further in the coming days.

Sales of cold-weather car products such as windscreen wash with anti-freeze and ice scrapers are already 25 per cent higher than last week.
