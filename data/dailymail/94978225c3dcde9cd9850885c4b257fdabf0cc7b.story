You can’t accuse the auctioneers of overselling this property, having described it as ‘little more than a shell requiring complete renovation’.

But even the most avid of DIY fanatics might have trouble with this Victorian terraced house in the old mining village of Nantymoel, South Wales - which is going under the hammer for absolutely nothing.

The three-bedroom home is boarded up, with an old leather settee dumped in the garden outside, and auctioneers said it has a reserve price of ‘nil’ - meaning it could sell for only a few pounds.

Needs improvements: Paul Fosh Auctions said they have not been 'inside the house as the windows, or what’s left of them, are all boarded up'

Paul Fosh, founder of Newport-based 
Paul Fosh Auctions, said: ‘We haven’t been inside the house as the 
windows, or what’s left of them, are all boarded up.

‘We’re
told all there is of the house are the walls. The only concession to 
comfort appears to be a leather sofa which is in the forecourt to the 
front, outside of the building.

‘The
freehold property has a nil reserve which means that it could be sold 
for just a few pounds. But the new owner must be well aware that they’ll
need funds to renovate the place.’

‘It
is currently unfit for human habitation - it doesn’t even have slates 
on the roof,' he added. It has not been revealed who is selling the 
house, but it is believed that the former owner died.

Neighbours said it was a happy family home before falling into disrepair more than 10 years ago.

Lot: The home, which will be auctioned on June 20, was described as being 'in need of complete renovation'

One said: ‘It would be lovely if someone could wave a magic wand and turn it back into a home again. It is a bit of an ugly eyesore.’

Paul Fosh, auctioneer

The home, which will be auctioned on June 20 at 5pm at the Park Inn Cardiff North Hotel, was described in the Paul Fosh auction booklet as being ‘in need of complete renovation’.

It said: ‘The property comprises a traditional mid-terrace house situated in the village of Nantymoel, which lies approximately 8 miles to the north of Junction 36 of the M4 and a further 2 miles from Bridgend town centre.

‘The property has not been inspected internally by the auctioneers but the accommodation is believed to be little more than a shell requiring complete renovation. Garden to the rear.’

Cheap move: The one-bedroom flat in Hartlepool, County Durham with an auction price of just £2,500

A two-bedroom home in Burnley, Lancashire was labelled the cheapest house in Britain in April, on sale with a starting price of just £1,000.

The property was so dilapidated that it would have taken thousands of pounds to make it liveable. Estate agents marketing the house admitted the home was 'in need of complete refurbishment'.

Another of Britain's cheapest homes went to auction in February with a starting price of just £2,500 (right).

Estate agents admitted the one-bedroom flat in Hartlepool, County Durham, was in a 'distressed' state, but said the first-floor apartment could make an ideal first home with lots of DIY.

And a three-bedroom house that went on sale in Middlesbrough was given a starting price of just £750 when it went under the hammer last October.

The semi-detached home featured a lounge, entrance hall, family bathroom and a front and rear garden. Although situated in a troubled area of the town, it was described as an ‘ideal investment’.
