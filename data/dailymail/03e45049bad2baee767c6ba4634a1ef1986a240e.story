Republican Representative Eric Cantor announced this morning that he will resign his seat this month to make way for his successor ahead of the lame-duck session.

The Virginia Representative, who stepped down as House majority leader yesterday, had 
previously said he would serve his full term, which would have ended in 
January.

But the 51-year-old, seven-term House veteran now says he will step down on August 18 to make sure constituents have a 'clear and strong voice' during the 'consequential' session.

Stepping down: Republican representative Eric Cantor has announced he will resign his seat on August 18, months earlier than expected

'The issues that will be considered 
during the lame-duck session this year will be crucial to the future of 
our country,' he said. 'These debates will continue into the new Congress, and the 
people of this district deserve to have their new voice representing 
them and engaging on their behalf.'

Cantor made the announcement overnight via a guest column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper. 

The outgoing Congressman said he has already asked Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to call a special
 election for his district that coincides with the Nov. 4 general 
election. That would enable his successor to take office immediately.

That person is likely to be college professor Dave Brat, the Tea Party-backed political novice who Cantor lost the Republican primary to in June. The non-partisan Cook Political Report rates Cantor's seat as a solid Republican congressional district, and Brat is expected to win the general election  by as many as 10 points.

In his guest column Cantor indicated that he had not yet made a decision about how he intends to use his new-found free time.

'I certainly look forward to doing what I did when I first became a 
Republican: advocating, as a private citizen, for the conservative 
solutions to the problems we face that will secure our nation’s 
greatness and provide a better life for all American,' he noted.

'While my days as a congressman will soon be behind me, my days of fighting for those ideas as a citizen are ahead of me,' he said. 'I’d like to thank the voters, my neighbors, my friends, for giving me the extraordinary opportunity to serve, and I look forward to continuing to work for an America that works and an America that leads.'

Before his defeat, Cantor had been seen as a potential rival — and likely successor — to House Speaker John Boehner.

Though he had a conservative voting record, Cantor was distrusted by some Tea Party supporters who suspected he might be too eager to reach a compromise on immigration legislation.

On his final day as No. 2 House GOP leader, Cantor gave a 10 minute speech thanking his colleagues and sharing his vision for America.

At the time, the remarks came off as more of a long goodbye than a changing of the guard, but with several months left before the end of the current legislative session, spectators assumed Cantor was giving a Swan song as the Republican Majority Leader.

During his remarks Cantor mentioned problems in the Middle East and tensions with Iran and Russia
 and said the U.S. must 'make leadership abroad a priority.'

Cantor also said Friday that improving educational opportunity for low-income children is 'the civil rights issue of our time.'

After his speech, Cantor received a standing ovation from members of both parties and shared a hug with the No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who in turn gave a short speech praising his political foe as a good lawmaker.

As it would turn out, Cantor's speech from the House floor yesterday was likely his last. Congress is due to adjourn for recess today until the second week in September.
