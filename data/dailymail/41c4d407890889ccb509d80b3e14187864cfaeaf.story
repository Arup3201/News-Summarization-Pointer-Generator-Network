Dozens more retired New York police officers and firefighters have been arrested in connection to the disability benefits fraud scheme.

Another 28 people are going to be arrested throughout the day,  making this the second round of arrests in the wide-ranging social security benefits scheme.

The plot was first reported in January when the Manhattan District Attorney announced that more than 100 people were arrested after being involved in a longterm plot wherein they claimed to have disabilities like post traumatic stress disorder in an effort to steal hundreds of thousands from the government.

Being taken in: This is one of the 28 former police and firefighters who were arrested today for their alleged involvement in the benefit fraud scheme that stole up to $400million from taxpayers

Tarnishing the badge: The latest batch of suspects have not yet been named but are being rounded up currently

Not all of the latest 28 offenders have been named, but one has been identified as former police officer Sam Esposito, whose father Joseph was arrested last month after being labeled one of the scheme's 'ringleaders'.

Of the latest arrests, 16 were retired NYPD officers, four were from the fire department, one was from both the fire department and then police department and another was from the department of corrections.

Aside from those 21 individuals, there were seven others who were arrested today and the list of all 28 names was released publicly but it does not indicate which suspect corresponded with which agency.

'Last month’s indictment was the first step in ending a massive fraud against American taxpayers,' said District Attorney Cy Vance in a statement.

'Today, dozens of additional defendants have been charged with fabricating psychiatric conditions in order to fraudulently obtain Social Security Disability insurance, a critically important social safety net reserved for those truly in need.

'These defendants are accused of gaming the system by lying about their lifestyle, including their ability to work, drive, handle money, shop, and socialize, in order to obtain benefits to which they were not entitled.

Under cover: Some of the schemers had been benefiting from ill-earned disability payments for decades

Waiting for the story: The DA has not yet released the names of the suspects but in their earlier round up of more than 100 recipients, they even told how they were determined to be falsifying their claims

'Their lies were repetitive and 
extensive. My Office is continuing to work with the U.S. Social Security
 Administration to bring additional cases, where appropriate.'

All told, prosecutors told The New York Daily News
 that up to $400million may have been netted by the schemers, and it is 
entirely possible that hundreds of others could be arrested.

There were 102 people who were indicted as recipients in the fraudulent benefits scheme on January 7.

The
 recipients were a mix of 72 former NYPD officers, eight former fire 
fighters, and other corrections officers all who made up different 
physical and psychological conditions that they reportedly incurred on 
the job.

Some of the accused had been falsely claiming disability funds since the 1980s- with the help of four administrative ringleaders- while others only started after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Many were coached about how they could appear depressed or in the throes of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and others said that their work on Ground Zero led them to feel incapacitated in large crowds.

The roles of the individuals arrested today and the bogus claims that they allegedly made have yet to be explicitly laid out.

When the District Attorney's office made their case in January, they released photos of some of the accused blatantly showing off their wealth and behaving in ways that would been impossible if their disability claims were true.

Glenn Lieberman, 48, was held up by the New York District Attorney as one of the poster boys for the widespread scam.

Rounding them up: The 28 new suspects are being brought into the Manhattan District Attorney's office over the course of Tuesday- many of whom are now in the custody of their former colleagues

Walk of shame: This new suspect tries to hide his face using an Under Armor hat

The former police officer was living in a rented $1.5million  waterfront mansion that has a pool and access to a waterway where he parked his two jet skis at the time of his arrest.

The officers were not the only ones in on the scheme, as The Post reports that some of the accused' siblings pulled the same move.

Vincent LaMantia is one of the 102 indicted fraudsters, and his siblings Darrin, Karen and Thomas all told officials that they had psychiatric ailments that made it impossible for them to hold down a job.

All told, the Staten Island siblings collected $596,000- with the largest portion- $287,000- going to Thomas as he began making disability claims in 2002.

Vincent, 43, collected $148,000 and the remaining $161,000 was split between Karen, Kevin and Darrin.

Many of the fraudsters left a virtual trail, including Vincent LaMantia who posted a motivational video online (which has now been removed) where he talked about ways to get rich quick.

Sending a message: Glenn Lieberman is pictured on a jet ski, clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing. He was one of the original 102 people caught in the first bust in January

Not so afraid of crowds now: Joseph Morrone, who said his post-9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working, collected $108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed San Gennaro festival

Busted: Mike Scialabba (left) collected $232,443
 from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot
 and Louis Hurtado (right) worked as a martial arts instructor while 
collecting $470,395 from Social Security

Active: Rich Cosentino collected a total of $207639 since May 2008

Another such example was that of Joseph Morrone, who told authorities that his work after the September 11th attacks left him with a debilitating fear of crowds.

On Facebook, he was pictured selling cannolis at the crowded San Gennaro festival in Little Italy.

The suspicion is that there were a handful of 'crooked' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders in question and were fully aware of how to 'game the system'.

The four alleged 'ringleaders' were identified first, and it is clear that their positions within the NYPD and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years.

Participants would start out by contacting John Minerva, 61, a Detectives Endowment Association consultant, or Joseph Esposito, 64, a retired member of the NYPD.

Minerva or Esposito would then refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme- Thomas Hale, 89, and former FBI agent Raymond Lavallee, 83.

All four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny. The 9/11 disability claims are not the first that the four men have had a hand in, as ABC reports that they are believed to have been running disability scams since 1988.

The lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors- but not after some coaching.
