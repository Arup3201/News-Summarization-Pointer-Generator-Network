Newcastle boss Alan Pardew handed a first Premier League start to 17-year old Adam Armstrong on Boxing Day, a daunting debut against Manchester United.

But who is the young gun chosen to try and help the Geordies secure victory at Old Trafford?

SO WHO IS ADAM ARMSTRONG?

The latest Newcastle youngster to be blooded by Alan Pardew. At 17 years and 319 days, Armstrong is the first player under 18 to start for Newcastle in the Premier League.

AND WHERE DOES HE PLAY?

The youngster prefers to operate as a creative No 10, setting up and scoring goals, but he was used by Pardew at Old Trafford on the right of midfield.

WHAT’S HIS STYLE?

Despite being a lifelong Newcastle fan, Armstrong grew up idolising Wayne Rooney and models his game on the United man.

At 5ft 8in, he might be on the small side but he makes up for it with a strong physique.

WHAT ELSE SHOULD WE KNOW?

After joining the club aged nine, Armstrong moved up through the ranks and made his professional debut last season at Fulham.

He scored in every round as Newcastle reached last season’s FA Youth Cup quarter-finals and won the club’s ‘Wor Jackie’ award - named after Jackie Milburn - for best young player. 

He also helped England’s Under-17s win the European Championships in May.
