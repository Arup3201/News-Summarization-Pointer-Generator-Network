Members of his political party competing for federal office have at times gone to extreme lengths to dissociate themselves from him this fall, but President Barack Obama said Monday he isn't taking it personally.

'This isn't about my feelings being hurt,' Obama told Al Sharpton in a radio interview yesterday.

'These are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me, and I tell them, "you know what, you do what you need to do to win. I will be responsible for making sure that our voters turn out." '

The two-term Democratic president let his party's rank and file off the hook pretty easily given that many of them have publicly disavowed him and his polices in the last few months in order get an edge on their Republican opponents in November's midterm elections. 

Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes cut an ad last month listing off the ways her priorities differ from Obama's, particularly on energy, which is a prime source of income in her coal- rich state. 

'I am not Barack Obama,' she said in the commercial as she held a gun and shot skeet.

On two occasions since, Grimes has refused to say whether she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, even though she told a Kentucky newspaper in 2012 that the president had her support.

Georgia Senate candidate Michelle Nunn fought back against an ad released by her Republican opponent that features her in a photo with Obama by releasing a video explaining that the meeting with her party's leader took place at a party celebrating former President George H.W. Bush, a Republican.

Colorado Sen. Mark Udall ditched his own fundraiser last summer in order to avoid being seen with Obama, who was the guest of honor.

Nearly every embattled Senate Democrat who is up for reelection this year has hinted or said outright that it would not be ideal for the president to visit their home states ahead of the election. And none of them have been eager to have the president stump for them.

Only lawmakers who are assured reelection such as Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin have been willing to appear with Obama in public. Durbin shared the stage with Obama over the weekend when the president returned to his home state to campaign for the state's incumbent governor, Pat Quinn, and cast his vote.

Obama insisted on Monday that he's not offended by other senators' behavior, however, and he told Sharpton that he understands why they don't want to campaign with him.

'We've got a tough map. A lot of the states that are contested this time are states that I didn't win. And so some of the candidates there, it is difficult for them to have me in the state because the Republicans will use that to try to fan Republican turnout,' Obama said.

'The bottom line is, though, these are are all folks who vote with me; they have supported my agenda in Congress, they are on the right side of minimum wage, they are on the right side of fair pay, they are on the right side of rebuilding our infrastructure, they're on the right side of early childhood education,' he added.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest argued today that President Obama could aid Democratic candidates in ways other than by headlining campaign events for them.

Candidates running in all states are going to need the support of the president's base if order to win, he told reporters.

'And so helping voters in all these states understand the stakes in the midterm election is one way the president can help Democratic candidates on the ballot,' he noted. 

The Obama spokesman declined to 'second guess' Democrats who have opted to distance themselves from Obama and defended the candidates and their campaign hands as party loyalists who have a 'strong track record of success.'

'It should be their decision. It's ultimately their campaign. It's their name that's on the ballot,' he explained to the horde of reporters grilling him about his boss' comments to Sharpton. 

Earnest said it's not necessary for Democrats to fall in line behind the president on every major issue. Sharing a political party 'doesn't mean that they're going to agree on everything,' he said.

'But it does mean that the president wants members of Congress that have their priorities straight,' he said.  

Earnest had chastised Republicans earlier in the briefing for opposing a minimum wage hike and other economic policies championed by the president and traditionally supported by Democrats. 

The Obama spokesman said the president is eager to work with both Republicans and Democrats to pass laws that 'grow the middle class.'

But 'the fact of the matter is, for reasons that you'd have to ask them about, Republicans have blocked these proposals at every turn,' he claimed.
