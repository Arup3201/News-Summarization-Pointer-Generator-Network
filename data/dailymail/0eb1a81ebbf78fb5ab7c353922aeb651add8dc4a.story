The owner of a family-run department store destroyed by fire during the London riots says he does not want last year's violence to tarnish the image of young people.

Trevor Reeves was speaking as he unveiled more than 4,000 pictures of teenagers holding positive statements which have been placed on one of his other stores.

Some of the most evocative images of the unrest a year ago came when the House of Reeves was razed to the ground by a massive fire, having stood on the site for more than 140 years.

'Don't judge youngsters': Trevor Reeve, the owner of the fire-destroyed House of Reeves, looks through the window of his other store, which has been covered in 4,000 images of young people holding positive statements to mark the one-year anniversary of last year's violence in London

Hope: The adjacent store, part of the same business and which was damaged but has been refurbished, was decked with pictures of youngsters holding cards with hopeful messages for society and their community

business and which was damaged but has been refurbished, was decked with
pictures of youngsters holding cards with hopeful messages for society 
and their local community.

Co-owner Trevor Reeves and his father Maurice were present for the event.

Trevor
Reeves said: 'The positive legacy of the riots was the coming together 
of people of all ages and from all walks of life to help mend the 
capital.

'We were overwhelmed by the support that was offered to our family and many others affected in the days and weeks that followed.

'We
are blessed with so many bright, inspirational and positive young 
people in this country and I believe it's important that we don't allow 
the actions of such a few to cloud our judgment of the many.'

The move is designed to challenge the 
negative perceptions born from the actions of a minority of Britain's 
youth last year, and was organised by youth volunteering charity 
vInspired as part of its Reverse Riots campaign.

Prime
Minister David Cameron said: 'The riots last summer were a wake-up call
for the country and I am determined that we will do everything we can 
to tackle the causes of the riots to ensure we never see scenes like 
that again.

'As we approach 
the first anniversary of the riots, I'm pleased to see vInspired 
highlighting the good work that young people are doing in Britain and 
working with youth role models to encourage them to do something 
positive.

'It's important to give all young people the chance to become involved in their community and do something positive so I wish vInspired every success in their campaign.'

Trevor Reeves, 57, was forced to watch his family business, established in 1867, burn to the ground as firefighters were unable to tackle the blaze because the area had not been made safe by police.

He said recently: 'It's still pretty horrible. It's still pretty raw. We've been so busy that you don't think about it until someone asks you about it, and it's only when you start talking about it that you realise what a traumatic event it was.'

His father Maurice was out celebrating his wedding anniversary that night and came home to see television footage of the catastrophic fire.

'He phoned me and he was absolutely distraught. It was a terrible phone call, one that I will probably take to my grave, to hear that level of distress from my father,' Mr Reeves said.

House of Reeves was founded in 1867 as the Ye Olde Curiosities Shoppe in Church Street by Edwin Reeves, who handed the business down to his son, William.

It was one of the few buildings in Croydon to survive The Blitz during the Second World War.

After the war, the store changed name and was later passed to Maurice Reeves.

It became known as the House of Reeves and the corner where it was situated was named Reeves Corner.

A decision has yet to be made about what will happen to the land at Reeves Corner where the destroyed shop stood.

Gordon Thompson, 34, was jailed for 11-and-a-half years in April for starting the fire, after changing his plea to guilty three days into his Old Bailey trial.
