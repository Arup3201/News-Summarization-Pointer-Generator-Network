Two young children of a lesbian couple will receive thousands of pounds in NHS compensation after the death of their sperm donor father who was also the nephew one of the women.

Carlton Ashman, four, and his sister Sarah, six, were secretly fathered by 20-year-old Charlie Lowden, who died after hospital doctors failed to spot a lethal blood clot.

Mr Lowden’s aunt, also called Sarah Ashman, 42, is the civil partner of Claire Ashman, 31, who became the biological mother of the children after his donated sperm helped her fall pregnant.

The adult trio kept the truth a closely-guarded secret between themselves until Mr Lowden’s death forced his aunt to make an emotional confession about the true identities of the children to her sister Lynn Lowden, the victim’s mother.

Mrs Lowden and her husband, Charles Lowden, believe six doctors at Wansbeck General Hospital in Ashington, Northumberland, made errors in his care by dismissing his symptoms and ignoring vital test results.

The couple, from nearby Bedlington, immediately launched legal action against Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.

The trust has now admitted liability over
his death and agreed to pay out £85,000 in compensation following a 
settlement in the medical negligence case.

Children Carlton and Sarah have each had £35,000 put into a trust fund and will receive the money once they turn 18.

Mrs
Lowden will also get an additional £6,255 due to ongoing health 
problems, including depression. The remainder will go into her son’s 
estate.

Today, Sarah Ashman senior said: ‘My kids aren’t going to see their dad ever again and nothing has happened to the doctors.

‘It’s absolutely disgusting. It’s not about the money at all. My kids look up to the sky every day and talk to their dad.

‘He should be here with them. He played a big part in their lives.  

‘We would all go out for Sunday lunch together. We would take them to the park together.

‘They are the spitting double of him too. We are over the moon for what he did for us. He gave me and Claire a family and I’ll never forget him for that. I would give up everything to have him back.’

Mr Lowden became seriously ill ten days after undergoing a routine hernia operation at Hexham General Hospital in November 2009.

He was rushed into Wansbeck General Hospital suffering from severe chest and back pain and was vomiting blood on December 8, with a letter from his GP stating his symptoms were indicative of a post-operative clot.

But doctors at the Ashington-based hospital ruled out the fatal condition despite abnormal test results, which included an X-ray showing a shadow on his right lung.

Instead, they diagnosed him with a suspected viral chest infection and discharged him the next day.

Mr Lowden later collapsed at his home in Bedlington and died on December 9, when the clot, which had formed in his left leg, travelled through his veins and into his heart, causing a cardiac arrest.

Charlie also left a sister Ruth, 16, and brother Jonathan, 21.

It was only then that the family learned that he had been the father to little Carlton and Sarah.

His parents, who learned they were biological grandparents as well as aunt and uncle to Carlton and Sarah, were shocked but overjoyed to make the discovery the youngsters had been conceived with their son’s help.

Mrs Lowden said: ‘Even though it wasn’t done in the most conventional of ways, he still would have been in their lives and at some point, [the children] would have been told about him.

It was never going to be a secret kept forever.’

Speaking about the settlement, she saide: ‘For us, it’s never been about the money. No amount of money in the world can mend a broken heart.

‘Until we get an apology and something is done about what they did, we will not walk away from this.’

His parents had hoped that the NHS trust would specifically acknowledge the children.

Mrs Lowden added: ‘We didn’t want to accept their offer because, at first, they refused to acknowledge the kids.

‘We even offered to provide DNA samples if they had wanted.

‘We told them we would accept an offer, if they recognised them, which they have now done.

‘But I feel like it’s an insult to my son’s memory because, more than two years on, we have still not had an apology for what happened, which would have gone a long way if they had have done that at the beginning.’

A spokeswoman for Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We are deeply saddened by the death of Mr Lowden and wish to again express our sympathies to his family at this difficult time.

‘Whilst a settlement has been made, we recognise it will not compensate the family for their loss.

‘We have implemented the recommendations made by the coroner and have put the necessary measures in place to minimise the chance of a similar case happening again.’
