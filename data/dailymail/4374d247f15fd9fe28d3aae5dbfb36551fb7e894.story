A teacher is in critical condition after four Pennsylvania teenagers deliberately threw a rock from a highway overpass onto the windshield of her family's car, police said.

The 8lb rock smashed Sharon Budd, a 52-year-old mother and breast cancer survivor from Ohio, in the head, causing her to lose an eye and inflicting life-threatening swelling on her brain.

She was injured as she drove on Interstate 80 with her husband Randy and their daughter Kaylee, 19, to New York at around 11.45pm on Thursday.

The boulder smashed through the windshield as they passed Milton and Mrs Budd, who was a front seat passenger, was struck in the head. Her daughter, who was driving, pulled over the car.

'It was the most gruesome thing that 
you could ever imagine,' Randy told The Repository newspaper.

The mother of four was rushed to hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania where she needed emergency surgery on her brain to reduce the pressure from swelling. She has been heavily sedated since.

Randy Budd said his wife had just finished speaking with their eldest son, Lucas, before the vehicle was struck by the rock.

The 28-year-old was scheduled to leave for Afghanistan with the Ohio National Guard this week for a one-year deployment but his departure has been delayed as his mother fights for her life.

After hanging up the phone, she asked him to send her a photo from his station in Fort Bliss, Texas, which he did.

'He wrote back, "I really miss you mom",' Randy Budd said.

Fears: Randy said when he saw her injuries, 'it was the most gruesome thing that you could ever imagine'

Four teens, including 18-year-old Brett Lahr and 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, have been charged in the incident. Two other juveniles identified only by their initials - KLN and TGP - were also arrested.

They face felony charges of aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and counts of propulsion of missiles into an occupied vehicle or onto roadway, possessing of instruments of crime and recklessly endangering another person, the Daily Item reported.

KLM told state police that they had been driving in his Mitsubishi Eclipse when they stopped on the overpass to Interstate 80, according to the criminal complaint, the Daily Item reported.

Dylan Lahr and TGP got out and threw rocks at and struck passing vehicles, KLM told troopers. He said he saw a vehicle slow down but that they fled to the Lahrs' house.

They then got into the Lahr family's gold Honda Accord and drove past the scene to see what was happening and when they saw a police car, they returned to the home.

Scene: A group of teenagers threw rocks from this overpass in Milton, Pennsylvania last week and one landed on the Budds' car. Four teens were arrested and now face charges in the incident

KLM and Brett Lahr headed back to the scene again and saw several more police cruisers before returning to the Lahrs' house.

Police checked the license plate of the Honda, which was registered to the Lahr family, and went to their home in New Columbia.

When questioned by police, TGP said he threw one rock onto I-80 but did not strike a vehicle whereas Dylan Lahr threw at least two rocks and one of them struck a car.

Brett Lahr, the older brother, remained in Union County Prison in lieu of $50,000 bail, while Dylan Lahr was released on supervised bail.

Sharon Budd's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with her medical costs.
