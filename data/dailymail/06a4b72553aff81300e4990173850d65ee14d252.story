Shock and awe: US Central Command released a series of videos Thursday showing massive coalition airstrikes on ISIS targets in northern Iraq

Fiery blast: This image shows the moment a bomb struck an ISIS-held tunnel in Kirkuk, Iraq, Wednesday 

The impact of the explosion sent clouds of dark smoke into the air, which blotted out the sky

Another clip, this one black and white, shows an attack on a building in Kirkuk held by militants, and two other videos released by CentCom depict airstrikes on an ammunition bunker near the city of Baiji in northern Iraq.

All of the videos are dated November 19 - the same day French officials announced that Rafale jets had struck Islamic State targets alongside coalition planes near the northern Iraq city of Kirkuk to help breach the group's front lines. 

Two Dassault-built Rafale fighters, both armed
with four missiles, targeted trenches used by Islamic State to
besiege the oil city, the defense ministry said in a
statement.

'This action was carried out simultaneously with our allies
to create a breach in the defensive positions held by the
terrorists on the front line between Iraqi forces and Islamic
State,' the statement read.   

US-led coalition forces also bombed an ammunition bunker near the Iraqi city of Baiji

Blitz: The bunker strike was one of 30 airstrikes on ISIS targets in both Iraq and Syria 

On Friday, the US Central Command said that American forces and their allies have staged 30 airstrikes on ISIS installations in both Syria and Iraq. 

The 23 strikes in Iraq included six near Baiji that hit
ISIS buildings, vehicles and tactical units while
buildings, vehicles, a guard post and two tactical units were
destroyed near Sinjar in four air strikes, Central Command said. 

Similar targets were destroyed or damaged west of Kirkuk, near
Mosul and Ramadi and in Tal Afar.

In Syria, six strikes near Kobani destroyed staging areas,
buildings and two tactical units, while another near Ar Raqqah
damaged an Islamic State barrack. 

Peshmerga troops took control of Kirkuk following the withdrawal of Iraqi armed forces in the face of the ISIS advance. Government and Kurdish troops are slowly starting to turn the tide since getting air support from the US-led coalition.

On Thursday, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in an interview aired on CBS This Morning that the Islamic State group is 'an incredibly powerful new threat.' 

Islamic State in Iraq and Syria fighters have seized swathes of territory
in lightning offensives in the oil-rich north of the
country, and have repeatedly attacked oil installations. 

He said the United States has never seen an organization like the Islamic State.

Hagel he described ISIS as 'so well organized, so well trained, so well-funded, so strategic, so brutal, so completely ruthless.'

Hagel's comments came a week after he and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey warned Congress that the US campaign against the Islamic State militants could be long and difficult.

Last Sunday, the extremist organization released a video showing the horrifying aftermath of the execution of captive American aid worker Peter Kassig, and on Friday ISIS posted online another recording in which British hostage John Cantile said he likely will be the next person to be beheaded.
