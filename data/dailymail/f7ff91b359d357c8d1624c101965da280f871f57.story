Wildlife campaigners have described Prince William’s decision to go hunting just days before launching an anti-poaching crusade as ‘unfortunate’.

The future king led a meeting at London Zoo yesterday, in his role as President of United for Wildlife, to develop an international response to the slaughter of endangered animals for their body parts.

It was the prince’s first public appearance since spending the weekend at a Spanish hunting lodge owned by one of the richest men in the country, the Duke of Westminster, shooting wild boar and stag.

Top guns: Prince William and Prince Harry arrive is Spain with friend Jecca Craig

Finca La Garganta in rural Cordoba spans 37,000 acres, and is one of the most exclusive hunting estates in western Europe.

He and his brother Harry flew out last Thursday, along with a group of friends including Jecca Craig, whom Prince William is rumoured to have dated in the past.

While the prince’s passion for  saving rhinos, elephants and tigers from extinction was praised yesterday, his weekend activities had not escaped the attention of fellow campaigners.

Will Travers OBE, President of the Born Free Foundation, said: ‘I don’t think it was great timing and I personally do not hunt.

Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince's timing was unfortunate

‘But I would say this – we mustn’t get these two issues confused.

‘This is all about industrial levels of wildlife crime linked to terrorist organisations, which will come to our door if we don’t do something about it.

‘I hope people can, whether they agree with hunting or not, leave that to a different debate and focus right now on wildlife crime.’

Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince’s timing was unfortunate, but added: ‘The involvement of Prince William and Prince Charles has brought so much attention and it’s so important, because some of these species are actually vanishing.’ 

In a speech at the symposium, which brought together seven wildlife charities, William told supporters: ‘The forces that are currently destroying some of the world’s endangered species are sophisticated and powerful.

'But this week, we are seeing the creation of an equally powerful alliance, coming together to help fight them.’

The campaigners plan to use new technology to target poachers, as well as those who buy illegal rhino horn, ivory and tiger products such as their skins.
