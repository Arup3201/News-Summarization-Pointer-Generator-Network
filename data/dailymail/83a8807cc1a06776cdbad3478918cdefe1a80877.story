A 26-year-old mother has been killed after she fell out of a party bus on Saturday evening and was hit by three cars on a highway.

Jamie Frecks had been celebrating a friend's bachelorette party when she tumbled out of an emergency door into traffic on Interstate 35 in Kansas City.

She was with 15 girlfriends on the bus when the door opened around 10pm. The 26-year-old has hit by three vehicles, two of which did not stop.

Horror: Jamie Frecks, 26, had been at a bachelorette party with friends when she tumbled out of an emergency door on a party bus into traffic in Kansas City

Beloved: Jamie Frecks had given birth to her daughter Emma just two months ago and had been enjoying a rare night out with friends when she died

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Miss Frecks had given birth to her daughter Emma two months previously and had been enjoying her first night out with friends when the tragedy occurred.

She was planning to marry her fiancé next year after becoming engaged on Christmas Day.

Miss Frecks also hoped to return to college, with dreams of becoming an art teacher, friends said.

Her aunt Cynthia Matteson pleaded with the drivers of the two vehicles who had fled the scene to come forward to help with the investigation, Fox reported. 

Ms Matteson added: 'She was a wonderful daughter, friend, granddaughter - a wonderful person to know.'

Highway patrol are investigating how the emergency door of the bus managed to fall open.

The hire company Midnight Express Party Bus had not returned a request for comment to MailOnline at the time of publication.

The driver of the 1999 Ford Econoline E450 bus was named as 49-year-old Deborah Elmer.

The driver of one vehicle who hit Miss Freck told KCTV5 that there had been no time to avoid her.

No other members of the bachelorette party, all women in their twenties and thirties, were injured.

Police are searching for the drivers of the two vehicles who left the scene. 

Funeral arrangements were being made for Miss Frecks today as loved ones planned to set up a memorial fund for her daughter.
