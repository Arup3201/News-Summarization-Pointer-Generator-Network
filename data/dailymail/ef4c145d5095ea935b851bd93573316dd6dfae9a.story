Paula Deen has decided to hit the road with a 20-city speaking tour as her latest attempt to launch a comeback following her racism scandal.

The Savannah native will be touring different southern cities and hosting 90-minute shows that will be part-cooking demonstrations and part party games.

'We are going to play musical chairs and the dating game with the audience. That's the excitement of it all- my fans get to be a part of the show. I'll also invite some folks in the audience to come onstage and cook with me,' she told The Miami New Times.

Back in the (virtual) kitchen: Paula Deen has announced a 20-show cooking tour that will kick off this summer as the latest leg in her comeback campaign (pictured at a food festival in Miami this February)

In addition to the audience members- who will pay anywhere from $42 to $211 for tickets- she will have spousal support on stage as well.

Her husband Michael will be co-headlining the tours, which start on July 21 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

'The crowd just loves him. He's an integral part of the show. And he will put me in my place in a New York minute! We have so much fun bantering back and forth with each other,' she said.

So far, seven of the 20 talks have been announced, and are scattered between Tennessee, Texas and her hometown of Savannah, Georgia.

Family support: She teased that 'you never know' who will show up at the talks- like her chef son Bobby (left)- but her husband Michael Groover (right) is co-headlining the entire tour so he will be at every show

The kick off in Pigeon Forge comes as little surprise since Deen is in the process of having a $20million restaurant built in the resort area.

The rest of the tour dates will be unveiled later this week, but they are expected to remain below the Mason-Dixon line, with stops in Nashville, Tennessee and San Antonia, Texas.

'When I step out onstage, it's the most amazing feeling, y'all. I feel so alive when I walk on that stage, and I love that kind of adrenaline rush,' she told The Miami New Times.

'By going on tour, I can see all my amazing fans in different cities across the United States.'

Tickets go on sale Thursday May 1 and the super fans who are willing to pay three-digit ticket prices to see the 67-year-old chef will get extra access to photo opportunities, meet-and-greets, and extra receptions featuring her signature recipes.

The tour is just the latest in an increasingly busy schedule for Deen, who lost her Food Network show and millions in corporate sponsorships after she admitted in a deposition that she had previously used the n-word.

Earlier this month, she spoke about how she was able to launch her business in Savannah at a conference for the town's tourism board.

She was wearing a removable boot brace at the time, explaining how her dog had inadvertently jumped on her and caused her to break her foot.

In February, she announced that a private equity investment firm poured $75million to $100million into her brand, banking on her prospects of bouncing back.
