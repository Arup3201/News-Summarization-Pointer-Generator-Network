Slavisa Jokanovic will be hoping to stop the revolving door to the Watford manager's office, but he was not helped by Michail Antonio scoring a double for Nottingham Forest to twice come from behind.

Swapping four managers in 37 days had not stopped Watford topping the table ahead of the match and they dominated their opponents.

Jokanovic's appointment came out the left field – Chelsea once paid £1.7million for him when he was a defensive midfielder – and the 46-year-old's managerial career has taken him to Serbia, Thailand, Bulgaria and Spain.

His first home game in charge of Watford should have ended with a win, but Stuart Pearce's resilient Forest side fought back twice to level.

Jokanovic only took charge of his first Watford game on Saturday – a 3-0 win away to Sheffield Wednesday – and has not had long with the side, but he is already getting them to play slick football.

In the opening half-an-hour, it was pulling Nottingham Forest apart.

On 20 minutes the ball moved swiftly from Daniel Pudil to Fernando Forestieri to Matej Vydra, who took a touch before trying to poke the ball past Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow. Only his legs stopped the ball from going in.

Another flowing move set up Vydra again in the 27th minute. Daniel Tozser sprayed a ball out to the left to Forestieri who cushioned it first-time into the path of the Watford striker on the edge of the box, but he was again denied by Darlow.

Two minutes later, one of their fine passages of play was finally rewarded. This time Almen Abdi crossed, Gianni Munari helped the ball on with a lovely flick with the back of his heel and Odion Ighalo put the ball in from close range.

It was such a shame, then, that all Watford's work was undone by diabolical defending in their own half, to allow Forest to equalise within another two minutes.

Abdi passed straight to opposition winger Michail Antonio 30 yards from goal and he ran at Joel Ekstrand, left him for dead on the edge of the box before finishing low past Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes.

Forestieri twice forced Darlow into parrying awkward swerving efforts and sent another dipping narrowly over the bar. So when the half-time whistle blew, Jokanovic could be forgiven for feeling frustrated with the scores level.

Watford started the second half in the manner in which they played the first – dominating their opponents.

And it did not take long until they went ahead, in the 52nd minute. Another rapid, flowing break ended with Forestieri crossing low to Vydra who was about to score from six yards out when he tangled with Forest defender Kelvin Wilson and a penalty was awarded.

Vydra got back up to stroke the spot kick into the bottom right corner, with Darlow flying in the other direction, for his fifth goal in seven games.

But again, on 67 minutes, poor play at the back cos the home side and left Antonio unmarked at the back post to power in Burke's cross to level.

But Antonio has the last laugh as he sneaks in at the back post to make it 2-2 and grab a point for Forest
