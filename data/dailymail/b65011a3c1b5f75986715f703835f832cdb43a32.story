Four new victims have come forward to make shocking claims about a vampire-obsessed trucker they say held them captive and kept them as sex slaves over an extended period of time.

Timothy Jay Vafeades of Salt Lake City, Utah, has already been charged with kidnapping and abusing two women, one a relative, after he allegedly forced them to travel around the country in his truck while repeatedly having sex with him against their will.

Vafeades, who wears fangs, named his truck the 'Twilight Express,' most likely in reference to the popular vampire series.  

Creep: Four new victims have come forward to say they were held as sex slaves by Timothy Jay Vafeades, a vampire-obsessed trucker who enjoys wearing fangs

New charges: Three of the new victims claim Vafeades used a Dremel power tool to grind down their teeth and one alleges he used an X-acto knife to give her new teeth

Now, four more woman have been identified as victims of the same alleged assaults.

These new victims are making allegations very much similar to the two previous women, saying Vafeades, 54, took their cell phones and identification cards, forced them to shower and sleep naked with him, and beat them repeatedly while sexually assaulting them on a daily basis.

Three of the victims also claim he used a Dremel power tool to grind off their teeth, and one alleges he took an X-acto knife to remove her teeth so she could wear false teeth.

He also cut and dyed their hair and forced one woman to marry him.

These new claims, which span from 1994 to as recently as 2013, come as federal prosecutors try and build up a case to use as evidence showing a pattern of behavior as they try Vafeades on charges related to his two most recent victims.

According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Vasfeades' attorney is trying to have almost all of this evidence thrown out as he claims his client was unlawfully detained when officers first picked him up during a traffic stop in Minnesota. 

Behind bars: Vafeades is already being held without bail of kidnapping and assault charges related to two other victims, one a teenage relative

Caught: He was arrested at a truck stop in Minnesota (above) in November of 2013 when officers noticed his passenger, the teenage relative, was bruised and battered

It was during that stop that officers discovered his first victim, a 19-year-old relative of the man, that they claim was bruised and battered.

Shortly after he was arrested, a second woman came forward with similar claims. 

Vafeades is also being charged with possession of child pornography after authorities found hundreds of child porn videos and images on his computer.
