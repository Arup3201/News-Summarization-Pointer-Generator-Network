France has revealed the existence of two 
more journalists taken hostage in Syria, after the prime minister 
identified them in a radio interview, apparently by mistake.

The two men, Nicolas Henin, who was working for Le Point magazine, and Pierre Torres, who was reporting for French-German television channel Arte, were taken on June 22, but their disappearance had not previously been made public.

The revelation takes the number of its captive citizens in the country to four.

Hostages: Both Pierre Torres, left, and veteran photographer Nicholas Henin, right, were experienced in working in hostile environments, Henin is pictured here while on location in Mogadishu, Somalia

In a statement the Foreign Ministry said explained that Mr Henin was working in Syria for Le Point 
magazine and Arte television while MrTorres was there to photograph municipal 
elections in the northeast city of Raqqa,

It said that the capture of the two men had not been disclosed before now out of respect for the families' wishes.

It also added: 'Everything is being done to ensure their release.'

However, in an interview on French radio 
station Europe 1 this morning, Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault 
named them for the first time while answering a question about two other
reporters whose kidnapping was disclosed in June.

In a post on its website, Le Point said Mr Henin, 37, had worked regularly for the weekly magazine for 10 years.

Unknown: Photographer Edouard Elias and newspaper journalist Didier Francois were kidnapped on their way to the Syrian city of Aleppo in June

In an interview on French radio France
Inter, Mr Henin's father said the last word the family had received about 
Henin was in August, when the French government told them he was alive.

Veteran war correspondent Didier Francois and photographer Edouard Elias, were also abducted on June 6 on their way to the northern Syrian city of Aleppo.

Speaking on Sunday French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed that both men were alive.

Press freedom advocate Reporters sans Frontieres calls Syria 'the most dangerous country in the world' for journalists, with 25 reporters killed and 32 imprisoned since the start of the country's civil war in March 2011.

Last month Spanish reporter Marc Marginedas, a special correspondent for El Periodico, was kidnapped, with his newspaper saying they have no contact with him since Sept. 4. Â
