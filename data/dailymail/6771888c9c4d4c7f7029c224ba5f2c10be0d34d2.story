Most gardeners are happy with a few tubs and baskets but for Edward Hayes that was far too easy.

So he built this 26ft-high flower tower, containing more than 2,000 plants including geraniums, pansies and fuchsias, in the drive of his home in Newport, South Wales.

The 71-year-old had planned to make his hanging gardens even bigger. ‘It was supposed to be 40ft high but the wife wouldn’t let me go any higher,’ Mr Hayes admitted.

Flower power: Edward Hayes, 71, waters the 2,000 plants in his tower. It took him three months and he has already replanted it once after initially filling it with daffodils and tulips

It may be just as well, as the tower, which has a spiral ladder inside, takes him three hours to water.

He made it from recycled office desks, building six steel sections which he welded together and tethered to a wall.

Mr Hayes, who is semi-retired, explained: ‘My main job is buying and selling office furniture. I had all this steel left over and thought, “I’ve got to make use of it”.’

It took him three months and he has already replanted it once after initially filling it with daffodils and tulips.

‘The neighbours adore it. A lot of people stop and take pictures of it and ask me questions,’ he said. ‘I’ve already got another one designed in my mind for next year.’
