Cashmere not only expensive but also notoriously difficult to clean, but a new invention may well change that.

A team of scientists from City University of Hong Kong's School of Energy and Environment have developed an invisible coating that triggers a chemical reaction when exposed to light.

When the mineral, which is made from anatase titanium dioxide, coats the fabric, any stain - from dirt to coffee and even red wine - on its surface will be eliminated after being placed in light for 24 hours.

No need for dry cleaning: A team of scientists from City University of Hong Kong have developed an invisible coating that can make cashmere wool clean itself when exposed to light

Like magic: When the anatase titanium dioxide coats the fabric, any stain - from dirt to coffee and even red wine - on its surface will be eliminated after being placed in light for 24 hours

What's more, lead scientist Walid Daoud says that the finished fabric will only bump up the price of cashmere by one to 1.5per cent.

Not only is the invention the ultimate in smart technology, but it's also beneficial to the environment.

'On the one hand, clothes that can clean themselves are regarded as smart material,' said Mr Daoud. 'And on the other hand ... we also have less consumption of energy, of water, of chemicals.'

The coating was actually first developed in 2002, but applying it to cashmere has proved difficult since the delicate fabric is especially prone to damage.

Two-fold: 'Clothes that can clean themselves are regarded as smart material,' explained lead scientist Walid Daoud. 'And on the other hand... we also have less consumption of energy, of water, of chemicals'

Special: The notoriously expensive cashmere wool is produced from the undercoat of Cashmere goats that only live in mountainous regions of Mongolia, Tibet and China

'It is a delicate operation because of the risk of spoiling the cashmere in the process,' Mr Daoud told FastCoExist.

'How to apply nano-sized photocatalysts to cashmere and retain its delicate characteristics was a huge challenge.'

But now that the technology has been perfected, he expects it to be a big hit in the fashion industry.

They predict it will soon hit the mainstream market, especially since it only raises the overall price of cashmere by about one per cent
