A Turkish bus driver filmed dancing in the aisle with his passengers while his vehicle was doing 70 mph down a motorway has been banned from driving for two years.

Metin Kandemir was arrested after a video of his antics on the bus carrying passengers through the western city of Istanbul became a hit on social media.

In the clip Kandemir is seen singing and clapping wildly along to a fast paced local folk tune being played on the radio while his passengers whoop along enthusiastically.

Turkish bus driver Metin Kandemir was filmed dancing in the aisle with his passengers while his vehicle was doing 70 mph down a motorway

After initially just dancing behind the wheel, Kandemir stood up and held hands with a passenger while dancing with her in the aisle 

On two occasions Kandemir gets out of his seat and walks into the aisle where he holds hands with a passenger as they dance together.

Police arrested Kandemir after the video - shot by one his passangers - became one of the most popular on social media in Turkey.   

The 34-year-old later apologised, saying: 'It was a mistake. I apologise to everyone. I will not repeat it. The road was empty at the time. This is the first time I've ever done it.'

But after hearing he had 32 previous convictions for traffic offences, Turkish judges fined him £45 for reckless driving and revoked his bus driver's licence for two years.

Kandemir said the incident 'was a mistake' that he would not repeat, but said the 'road was empty at the time'

Police spokesman Kaan Tore said: 'He's lucky not to be in prison. He could have killed everyone in that bus and worse.'

Turkey has one of the worst road safety records in the world largely based on the fact that many drivers believe it is out of their control if they have an accident.

The belief - known as Kismet - is that when a person's time is up, that is it, and therefore there is no point refraining from drinking while driving, maintaining the basic mechanical standards on a vehicle, or even paying attention while driving.
