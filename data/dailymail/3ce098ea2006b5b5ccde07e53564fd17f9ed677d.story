An image being shared by the NYPD supposedly showing uniformed officers gathering for the funeral of Rafael Ramos was actually taken in 2007.

The picture posted on Twitter by many of the department's precincts was actually taken from coverage of the funeral of Russel Timoshenko rather than of the thousands of officers who gathered in Queens on Saturday. 

The tweet uploaded by the 72nd Precinct read: 'Over 20,000 police officers pay their final respect to Detective 1st Grade Ramos.'

The tweet uploaded by many of the NYPD's precincts, including the 72nd, actually showed crowds gathered for the 2007 funeral of Russel Timoshenko, rather than those gathered to pay their respects to Rafael Ramos  

Another posted by the 34th read: 'To all who traveled or sent condolences for Officer Ramos. Thank you. Your support is overwhelming, and inspiring.' 

Timoshenko, 23, was shot and killed after pulling over a stolen BMW in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

It first appeared in a New York Times article covering the service for the Belorussian immigrant who died when he was in his second year on the job.

His funeral in Flatbush Avenue in the Flatlands was attended by 10,000 people. 

The NYPD Commissioner at the time, Raymond W. Kelly said in his eulogy: 'Russel was a remarkable young man, Disciplined, ambitious, enthusiastic, inspired by love of his new country, motivated to serve his beloved city, and dedicated to the mission of the New York City Police Department.'

On Saturday, tens of thousands of police from cities across the United States arrived in New York and lined the streets to pay respect to Ramos, 40, who was murdered alongside his partner Wenjian Liu last week. 

A number of dignitaries including Joe Biden, former New York mayor Rudy Guiliani and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton.

Embattled Mayor Bill de Blasio also made a speech during the service, during which officers turned their back as it was shown on the big screen. Many have criticized his dealing of the protests in New York City this month.
