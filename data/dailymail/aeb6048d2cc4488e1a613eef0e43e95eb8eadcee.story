Wayne Rooney was spotted on a day out at Chester races as Manchester United's dreadful season draws to a close.

The United striker was with team-mate Darren Fletcher, Old Trafford old boy Michael Owen and wife Coleen.

On day two of the Chester Festival, Rooney was snapped watching 3/1 favourite Orchestra come home in the big race of the day, the 2.45 Chester Vase.

The Aidan O'Brien-trained horse allowed Romsdal and William Buick back into the fold for a photo finish, but eventually got the result under Ryan Moore.

Rooney is injured at the moment, having watched United's final home match of the season - a 3-1 win over Hull - from the sidelines.

United face their last match of a season they'd rather forget away at Southampton, with Louis van Gaal set to be confirmed as the club's new manager in the summer.

And judging by pictures coming out of Holland on Thursday, Van Gaal will not tolerate another season of failure at Old Trafford.
