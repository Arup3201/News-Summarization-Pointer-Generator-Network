A couple laundered £63,000 of drug money and blew the cash on luxury goods, gadgets - and  a pet monkey.

Daniel Lawrence, 33, and Renata Flores, 45, were investigated by police after bank staff noticed a number of suspicious cash deposits.

Photos on Lawrence's open Facebook profile capture the couple cutting their wedding cake and also show his pet monkey, believed to be a marmoset, sat in a specially-made wooden shelter in a garden.

Convicted: Daniel Lawrence, of Penzance, was sent to prison for laundering around £63,000 of drug money, while his partner Renata Flores received a suspended sentence

Extravagance: As well as splashing out on luxury perfume and kitchen applicances, Lawrence also kept a pet monkey, believed to be this marmoset

An investigation revealed that Flores had nearly £12,000 of unexplained bank credits and her daughter Daisy, 24, had received £30,000 in cash into two accounts - despite being on benefits.

Her 19-year-old sister, Emily Flores' account also had a total of £22,000 of unidentified cash deposits paid into it.

The court heard Lawrence, who did not have his own bank account, and Flores had laundered money from the sale of illicit drugs to buy luxury home goods including a Smeg fridge and a range cooker.

Officers also found extensive ranges of expensive perfumes at their home - and discovered Lawrence had a pet monkey.

Jailing Lawrence for three years, Judge Christopher Harvey Clark, QC, said: 'It is crystal clear to the court that you were making large sums of money out of the illegal supply of drugs.

'In order to divert attention from yourself, you agreed, through Renata Flores and her two daughters, for the money that you were making to be laundered through bank accounts in the names of Renata, Daisy and Emily.'

Flores was sentenced to 20 months suspended for two years and 120 hours unpaid work after Judge Clark said she must have known 'at least something' of the scheme and had involved her daughters.

She had previously claimed to accept no responsibility whatsoever for the crime.

Prosecuting at Truro Crown Court, Joanna Martin, said police started investigating the family after a suspicious activity report from the Halifax.

She said: 'As well as cash deposits there was also further evidence of expensive items at the home address.'

The pair from Penzance, Cornwall, pleaded guilty to converting approximately £63,000 in criminal cash between March 1, 2007 and March 10, 2013.

Lawrence also admitted being in possession of the Class A drug morphine and the Class B drug cannabis on May 21, 2013, at an earlier hearing.

He pleaded not guilty to being in possession of the morphine with intent to supply it to another on the same date.

Daisy and Emily Flores both denied converting criminal property and the pleas were accepted by the prosecution and not guilty verdicts were recorded.

Robin Smith, defending Lawrence said that after some rehabilitation treatment he had managed to remain drug free.

He said: 'He seems to have turned things around during the currency of this case.'

Brian Fitzherbert, defending Flores, said she was valued at the soup kitchen where she volunteered said that her 'leek and potato soup was second to none' and she was the most valuable person in her team.
