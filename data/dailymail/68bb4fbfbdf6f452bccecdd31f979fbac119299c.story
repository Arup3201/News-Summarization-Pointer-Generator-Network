Jennifer A. Phippen, 37, is accused of giving a drunk teenage girl an IV instead of getting medical help

A 37-year-old woman is accused of giving a drunk 14-year-old  an IV instead of calling an ambulance or getting medical help.

Jennifer A. Phippen has now been charged with felony injury to child after the alleged incident at a house last month in Idaho.  

The girl was at a birthday party for a teenage boy with several of his friends when she drank several shots of alcohol and eventually lost consciousness.

According to the Ada County Sheriff's Office Phippen gave the girl an IV after some of the teens told her the girl was passed out and had vomited. 

Phippen gave the girl about 400-to-500 ccs of fluid - instead of calling paramedics, seeking medical treatment for the girl, or calling her parents.

Phippen also put the girl in the shower in an attempt to rouse her.

The girl eventually regained consciousness and walked home that morning.

Phippen is charged with two counts of felony injury to child - one for providing the 14-year-old girl and other teenagers with alcohol  and one for not getting the girl the appropriate medical treatment for what Phippen suspected was alcohol poisoning.

Ada County prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Phippen Friday and deputies arrested her Friday afternoon.

Phippen was booked into the Ada County Jail Friday afternoon on a $300,000 bond.

If she does not post bond, her initial court appearance will be Monday afternoon.

The crime of felony injury to child is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
