A jilted man who stabbed his teenage love rival to death after discovering he was dating his ex-girlfriend has been jailed for life.

Will Blencowe, 21, attacked 17-year-old Connor Tremble in a jealous rage at his flat the day before Valentine’s Day.

Blencowe, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, had travelled to the victim's flat in Oxford after discovering was seeing his ex-girlfriend Aimee Harrison, 20.

After the 'vicious' attack, Blencowe fled more than 50 miles away, leaving the victim with multiple stab wounds, including in the lung, back and buttocks. 

Will Blencowe, 21, pictured left, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, has been jailed for life with a minimum of 23 years for murdering 17-year-old Connor Tremble, pictured right, from Oxford in a jealous rage 

Connor spent two days fighting for his life in hospital but died 40 hours after the attack.

Today, Blencowe was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 23 years.

He showed no emotion as he was taken down to the cells from Oxford Crown Court to begin his sentence.

When the sentence was announced, Connor’s mother Lisa Tremble sighed with relief and said aloud 'always have faith'.

Speaking after the sentencing, she said the motive behind her son's 'horrific' murder had been 'nothing more than jealousy' and that Connor was 'a very special young man'. 

During the three-week trial, the court heard that Miss Harrison and Blencowe had a rocky four-year relationship in which Blencowe was often jealous and over-protective.

Miss Harrison described how she was concerned by Blencowe's obsession with knives, of which she said he had at least four, including a machete. 

The couple broke up in September 2013 and Miss Harrison began dating Connor early this year. They tried to keep the relationship quiet but Blencowe found out. 

Blencowe told the court that, on the day Connor was stabbed, he intended to end his own life and went to see Connor after being told he had drugs.

He caught a train from Banbury to Oxford, before taking a taxi to near Connor’s flat.

The court heard that, by some 'terrible coincidence', Connor's flat had been left open that day as painters had been there redecorating.

Blencowe went inside the flat and waited for Connor. When he returned home around 6.30pm, Blencowe attacked Connor with a knife. 

Connor’s flatmate Kyle Martin heard his friend shouting and went to the lounge to see what was happening. There, he found Connor bleeding on the floor, saying: 'I’m dying.'

Connor's mother Lisa said her son was a 'very special young man' and that the motive behind his murder was jealousy 

Connor was rushed to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery.

Meanwhile, Blencowe, had fled to Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, where he checked into the Croft Guest House. 

He moved to another guest house the next day but police tracked him down and arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder at around 4pm on February 14, while Connor was still alive.

Prosecutor Richard Barton previously told the court: 'When they told him it was attempted murder he repeated that. He said "attempted murder?" And he giggled.' 

During the case, the court heard Blencowe had mental health difficulties and was living at special accommodation.

The day Connor was stabbed Blencowe had a meeting with a key worker, appearing emotional and telling her he still loved Miss Harrison.

When she tried to cheer him up, he said: 'What’s the point? I’m going to be dead or in jail.'

Later that afternoon Miss Harrison called Blencowe after finding out he had been making threats towards Connor.

She asked him: 'What should I tell Connor if he sees you?'

He responded: 'Just tell him to run.' 

Paying tribute to her son after the hearing, Ms Tremble said: 'Will Blencowe is responsible for committing the most horrific and violent murder of our beloved Connor which he carried out with detailed planning.  

Oxford Crown Court heard Blencowe stabbed the victim several times, before fleeing more than 50 miles away. Connor was left fighting for his life in hospital but died 40 hours after the attack

'The motive behind Connor’s murder was nothing more than jealousy on Will Blencowe’s part and he showed Connor no mercy.

'No family should ever have to go through what we have gone through and are still going through.

'Connor was a very special young man who was vulnerable due to his special needs. He touched the hearts of everyone who knew him and everyone that he met.' 

Friends Bradley Jones and Grant Clemens were acquitted of perverting the course of justice after being accused of helping Blencowe flee.
