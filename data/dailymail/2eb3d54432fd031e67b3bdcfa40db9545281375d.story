A police officer was caught on video breaking the arm of a high school student while breaking up a school fight.

The incident took place on March 7 at West Brook High School, part of the Beaumont Independent School District (BISD) in Beaumont, Texas, the Beaumont Enterprise reports.

BISD Police Chief Clydell Duncan told MailOnline he did not know the circumstances that started the fight, but that the two male students involved 'had fought two or three times before.'

The two students are seen in the video fighting 
before a female security officer steps in and tries restrain one of the students, dressed in a dark t-shirt and 
gym shorts.

The
 unidentified student is then seen trying to break free, but is brought to the 
ground by the female security officer and a male police officer, 
identified as Officer Stephen Rivers.

Suspended: Officer Stephen Rivers, pictured, was placed on administrative leave without pay

Rivers is filmed grabbing the student's arm and pushing it forward, breaking it as a loud noise is heard. Meanwhile, the female security officer is hold's down the student's body.

The student can be heard screaming in the video, yelling 'Oh my God' - while Rivers appears to say 'It's all right.'

Online commenters have expressed their outrage at the video's content.

'Wow! What a piece of s***!' one user wrote. 'That looked completely unnecessary...'

'Stupid A** cops!!! Really couldn't control a kid so break their arm!! Dirt bag... ' another wrote.

'That cop deserves to bleed﻿,' another user wrote.

Duncan told MailOnline Rivers broke the student's arm because he used an improper technique while trying to 
handcuff him, placing his arm forward instead of backward.

'We have not determined the circumstances for improper technique,' Duncan said.

Duncan earlier told the Beaumont Enterprise he suspended Rivers without pay on March 17 when he first heard about the video. Duncan confirmed to MailOnline that the suspension is still in effect.

He said the school normally employs two security officers, as well as two to three police officers.
