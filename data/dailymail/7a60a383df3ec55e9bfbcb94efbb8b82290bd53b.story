Eager customers have waited up to 10 hours overnight to get their hands on prizes including 21inch TVs at the opening of a new Aldi store.

The company gave away golden tickets to the first 100 people through the door when the store in Avlaston, Derbyshire, was officially opened at 8am this morning.

More than 200 people were found queueing outside the store looking to get their hands on the deals when the ribbon was cut.

Ivy and Brian Bacon came all the way from Basford in Nottingham and queued from 10pm last night to get their hands on a 21.5inch television.

Ivy Bacon, 20, was delighted to win the top prize.

She said: 'It's brilliant, absolutely. It doesn't feel real, we never win anything.'

Former Derby County player Craig Ramage, who commentates on his former team's games for BBC Radio Derby, cut the ribbon at the event.

He said: 'I think it's perfect. It is easy access and I can't believe how many people turned up this morning.'

Built on an area of overgrown land next to a petrol station, the store will create 29 jobs – 12 full-time and 17 part-time – and will have a car park.

Permission for the store was granted by Derby City Council in July.

Aldi's arrival comes after Tesco pulled the plug on plans to build a large store nearby earlier this year.

The company has also made a £250 donation to the council to support its ongoing activities for the community and has donated a range of children's treats and baby products to Alvaston Children's Centre.

Some of the company's 'Specialbuys' will be available at the new store for bargain-hunters to get their hands on.

It is one of 60 Aldi stores opening across the UK this year.
