An 88-year-old war veteran is distraught after eight medals he earned during some of the toughest combat of World War II were stolen from his home.

Clyde Kellogg, a retired 1st Sgt., is appealing to the culprit to return his most prized possessions, which include a prestigious Purple Heart.

The medals, which Kellogg says only hold sentimental value, were stolen from his Vista, California, home on Friday.

'They don't have any financial value 
what so ever,' he told Fox5. 'It's devastating to have lost something 
I've treasured for over 65 years.'

Kellogg joined the military when he was just 18 years old and served 21 years in the Marine Corps.

He fought as a machine-gunner in some of the most dangerous battles of World War II, including storming the beaches of Guadalcanal.

During combat, the soldier was shot in the throat, causing him to lose half his voice box, and also spent a year in the hospital battling malaria.

The famous battle of 1943 earned him a 
Purple Heart and he was awarded a Bronze Star after killing three 
Japanese soldiers who emerged from a tank after running over his machine
gun emplacement, he told the North County Times.

Kellogg was also awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, World War II victory medal, three riflery medals and a good-conduct medal for his military service.

For years, the symbols of the sacrifice he made for his country hung on a wall at his Vista home, where he and others could admire them.

But now they're gone, he says he feels like part of his life has been stripped from him.

'I spent 11 months in the hospital 
for my wounds, goddamn it, and someone just took it from me. It was part
of my life, and it was no picnic,' he told the NC Times.

Kellogg believes the perpetrator broke into his house and snatched the medals while he was at home.

There were signs of a forced entry and the San Diego County Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident.

'I never dreamed anybody would ever think about (stealing) it,' Kellogg told the NC Times.

'It just never dawned on me. What the hell? Somebody can't wear them on their clothes. I don't understand what the hell anybody would do with them. I just want my medals back.'
