Taking a moral stand: Prime Minister David Cameron said it was time to teach right from wrong

David Cameron last night called on the Archbishop of Canterbury to lead a return to the ‘moral code’ of the Bible.

In a highly personal speech about faith,
 the Prime Minister accused Dr Rowan Williams of failing to speak ‘to 
the whole nation’ when he criticised Government austerity policies and 
expressed sympathy with the summer rioters.

Mr Cameron declared Britain ‘a Christian country’ and said politicians and churchmen should not be afraid to say so.

He warned that a failure to ‘stand up 
and defend’ the values and morals taught by the Bible helped spark the 
riots and fuelled terrorism.

At Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford, 
where Dr Williams used to teach, Mr Cameron said the time has come for 
public figures to teach ‘right from wrong’, and questioned whether the 
Church of England has done enough to defend those values in the face of 
the ‘moral neutrality’ that pervades modern life.

And taking aim at the Archbishop, Mr Cameron tackled head-on his public criticisms of the Government over the last 12 months.

The speech was a bold Christmas gamble 
by Mr Cameron. In making a speech about religion, he did something that 
Tony Blair always longed to do but was talked out of by spin doctor 
Alastair Campbell, who flatly told him: ‘We don’t do God.’

The clash between the Government and 
Church is at its most acute since former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr 
Robert Runcie clashed with Margaret Thatcher’s government in the 1980s.

The Prime Minister appeared emboldened 
by his opinion poll bounce since his decision to wield the veto during 
the Eurozone crisis summit in Brussels last week.

Admitting that he had ‘entered the 
lion’s den’ by addressing an audience of churchmen, Mr Cameron said: ‘I 
certainly don’t object to the Archbishop of Canterbury expressing his 
views on politics.

Challenged: The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, should take the lead in promoting Christian teachings, according to the Prime Minister

‘But just as it is legitimate for religious leaders to make political comments, he shouldn’t be surprised when I respond.

‘I believe the Church of England has a
 unique opportunity to help shape the future of our communities. But to 
do so it must keep on the agenda that speaks to the whole country.’

At
 an event to mark the 400th anniversary of the publication of the King 
James Bible, he said: ‘We are a Christian country and we should not be 
afraid to say so.

'The Bible has helped to give Britain a set of values 
and morals which make Britain what it is today. Values and morals we 
should actively stand up and defend.

‘Whether
 you look at the riots last summer, the financial crash and the expenses
 scandal or the on-going terrorist threat from Islamist extremists 
around the world, one thing is clear, moral neutrality or passive 
tolerance just isn’t going to cut it any more.

David Cameron said it was 'easier for people to practise other faiths when Britain had confidence in its Christian identity'

‘Put simply, for too long we have been unwilling to distinguish right from wrong. “Live and let live” has too often become “do what you please”.

‘Bad choices have too often been defended as just different lifestyles. To be confident in saying something is wrong is not a sign of weakness, it’s a strength.’

Mr Cameron’s demands for a ‘moral code’ were directed at human rights apologists and Left-wing politicians who recoil from promoting Britain’s Christian heritage.

But they also covered the hand-wringing pronouncements of many senior churchmen, who refuse to condemn lawbreaking by rioters and show unwillingness to take on militant Islam for fear of offending Muslims.

The PM said an ‘almost fearful, passive tolerance of religious extremism’ had let Islamic extremism grow unchallenged and called for the promotion of ‘Christian values’ saying it was ‘profoundly wrong’ to believe that promoting Christianity would ‘do down other faiths’.

PM said it's easier to be Jewish or Muslim in Britain than in a secular country like France

Britons 'treasured' responsibility, hard work, charity, compassion, humility,
 self-sacrifice, love and pride in working for the common good, says PM

Even admitted he was only a 'vaguely practising' Christian with 'full of doubts' about theological issues
