Rising star: Esther McVey, a former presenter on GMTV and Children¿s BBC, looks set to take a seat at the Cabinet table

Esther McVey was invited through the door of 10 Downing Street last night amid speculation she will be one of the biggest winners in David Cameron’s reshuffle.

The employment minister, who is a former presenter on GMTV and Children’s BBC, looks set to take a seat at the Cabinet table as the Prime Minister tries to squash claims he has a ‘problem’ with women.

Mr Cameron will today promote a string of female junior ministers, while backbenchers will get a step up to government for the first time. His aim is clear: to rid the Tory side of the Government of the image that it is in some way ‘anti women’.

Miss McVey, the MP for Wirral West in her native Merseyside, impressed Conservative chiefs with fluent TV appearances to defend the Government’s welfare reform record.

There was speculation last night that the 46-year-old could be given the Minister  without Portfolio role vacated by Kenneth Clarke – with a Cabinet seat and wide-ranging remit to go around TV studios speaking up for the Coalition. Another possible role is that of Culture Secretary.

It means she is being lined up as a key face for the Tories in the run-up to the election.

Her success is set to be mirrored by around a dozen women, including schools minister Elizabeth Truss. Miss Truss, who is close to Education Secretary Michael Gove, is seen by some as a future leadership contender thanks to her attention to detail and unflappable manner.

Observers have pointed out that Margaret Thatcher got to the top of the party after a stint at education.

The comprehensive school-educated Oxford graduate, a married mother of two, used to work for Shell and Cable & Wireless.

Other possible promotions include Nicky Morgan, financial secretary to the Treasury and women’s minister. A protege of George Osborne, she can already attend Cabinet but is not a full member.

Penny Mordaunt, an aide at the Ministry of Defence, could also get a step up. She appeared on the ITV diving reality show Splash! to raise money for charity, and is a sub-lieutenant in the naval reserve.

Darling of the right, Priti Patel, is another name being spoken of as a new minister. The  backbench MP for Witham is a member of the Prime Minister’s policy unit at Number 10.

Her parents are Ugandan immigrants of Indian origin who came to the UK in the 1970s. Since her election in 2010 she has taken a tough line on crime.

Margot James, Amber Rudd, Claire Perry, Harriett Baldwin and Nicola Blackwood could also see themselves advance, and there is speculation defence minister Anna Soubry could do well. Miss Soubry represents the party often on Question Time and has been tipped as a future Defence Secretary.
