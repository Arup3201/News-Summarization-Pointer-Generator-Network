British women typically start going grey at the age of 33.

A study reveals that redheads may spy their first silver strands at 30, while brunettes go grey at 32 and blondes at 35.

The research, by hair product Charles Worthington Instant Root Concealer, also suggests that late nights cause those in the entertainment industry to go grey earliest, at just 27, while call centre workers may resist the longest - until their mid-30s.

And it seems the discovery of their first grey hair is a traumatic moment for most women.

One in three women - or 33 per cent - instantly feel old and 13 per cent admit feeling embarrassed.

One in five women said they felt shocked and upset when they found their first grey hair.

To combat their grey locks, the vast majority of women reach for the dye and cover it up.

The study found that 88 per cent do this straight away and 32 per cent resolved to hide the grey until the day they die.

But, it is not all doom and gloom for ageing women. A quarter of women took silver hair to be a sign of wisdom and experience.  

One in nine British women claim they welcome silvery locks and will never try to cover their grey hair. 

But it seems virtually all women give up in the end, with the average British women stopping to try and cover their grey hair aged 68. 

The average British woman surrenders and stops trying to cover grey hair aged 68.
