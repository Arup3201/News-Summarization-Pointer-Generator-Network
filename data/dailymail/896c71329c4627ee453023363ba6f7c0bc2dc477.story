Secretary: The official documents reveal Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a civilian detainee who worked as a secretary. As he was not considered a terror threat, he was released 10 months later

The bloodthirsty leader of the Islamic State  was once a secretary working in office admin, newly released documents have revealed.

Brutal Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was captured by American soldiers in 2004 in Iraq, and records from the time have revealed his life before he turned to terror.

The declassified documents show that al-Baghdadi - registered under his real name of Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badr - was held for 10 months in a military prison in the south of the country.

The terrorist's status was listed as 'civilian detainee', which means he was not then officially thought to be an insurgent. His occupation was written as 'Administrative Work (Secretary)'. 

He was registered as married, and an uncle is listed as being his next of kin - although all of his relatives' names have been redacted.

It is believed he was detained during a raid aimed at arresting his friend, named as Nessayif Numan Nessayif, in Fallujah. 

The records, obtained by Business Insider, were released through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Although his date of birth is also redacted, he is believed to be 43-years old-and has a wife and a young son. 

Friends of al-Baghdadi have previously told of how he was a talented footballer, with one former team-mate even describing him as the 'Lionel Messi of our team'. 

He was also remembered as a shy and unassuming young man who was interested in religious studies, before his radicalisation to a dangerous extremist.

Since rising to power within the Islamic State, al-Baghdadi's brutal thugs have shocked the world with their sadistic and savage murder of thousands of people in Iraq, Syria and Libya. 

The terror group - believed to have more than 30,000 soldiers - have revelled in posting graphic images and videos of murders including beheadings and burning victims alive.

There is a $10 million bounty on al-Baghdadi's head after the US State Department listed him as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist'. 

Transformation: Since announcing himself as leader of the Islamic State, al-Baghdadi's bloodthirsty thugs have carried out thousands of brutal executions in the region

He was seen publicly in a slick propaganda video last July for the first time in years, sporting a long beard and black robes to deliver a sermon.

Speaking in Mosul's central Mosque, al-Baghdadi announced that the lands his group had conquered were now part of the new Islamic State and announced himself as the 'caliph' or leader. 

Under his leadership, ISIS has spearheaded a militant offensive that has overrun much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland since June after seizing major territory in neighbouring Syria, and carried out a series of atrocities in both countries.

During their domination in the area, the group have been pegged back in recent weeks due to a series of air strikes which have resulted in deaths and the loss of important strategic locations. 

It was rumored that he was killed or wounded by a US airstrike last November, but the group moved to quash this by releasing an audio recording purporting to be him, in which he encouraged militants to attack Saudi Arabia.
