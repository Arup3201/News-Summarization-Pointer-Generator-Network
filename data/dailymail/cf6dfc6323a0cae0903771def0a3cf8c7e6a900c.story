A hotel guest turned wedding crasher has been arrested after he exposed his genitals to the bride and groom during their ceremony, authorities said.

Samuel James Dengel, 20, from Pennsylvania, was charged with indecent exposure after the incident at a hotel in Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday.

The mother-of-the-bride told officers that she saw a naked man in the window of a hotel room overlooking the courtyard at the DoubleTree Hotel where the wedding party had gathered.

The cheek of it: Samuel James Dengel, 20, has been charged with indecent exposure after showing his genitals to a wedding party in Charleston, South Carolina

Guests told investigators they had seen Dengel at the window fully clothed and waving before he came back naked, pressed his genitals against the glass and bent over.

Officers said when they went to Dengel's hotel room, he answered the door wearing only a towel. He was in the room with a woman but her identity has not been revealed.

He has a large tattoo, which he appeared to have been showing off to guests, when he flashed them during the celebration. According to philly.com, it reads: 'By the Power of Truth, I, while living, have Conquered the Universe.'

According to Dengel's Facebook page, he has worked for the U.S Navy since 2010. He is prolific in posting quotations to Facebook including: 'In a society that has destroyed all adventure, the only adventure left to destroy is society' and 'It's quite liberating to be able to look in the mirror and admit to yourself that you're a f*** up =D'.

It was not clear if Dengel has an attorney.
