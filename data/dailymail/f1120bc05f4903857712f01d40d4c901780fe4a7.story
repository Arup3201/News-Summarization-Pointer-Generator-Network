A former football player who fell into a coma after he was brutally beaten two months ago has been pictured holding the baby girl his wife delivered while he was in critical condition.

The image shows Isaac Kolstad, who played for Minnesota State, Mankato, taking a nap with little Malia in his arms in hospital on Thursday.

'It continues to amaze us the connection he
 has made with her through this ordeal,' his wife Molly wrote alongside the picture on CaringBridge. 'He truly, truly knows he is a 
daddy.'

Baby Malia was born on June 5 in the same hospital where her father was in critical condition with a traumatic brain injury after he was attacked near a bar in Mankato on May 11.

Rutgers University quarterback Philip
 
Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been 
charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of 
third-degree assault.

Trevor
 Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just
 days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts.

Kolstad, described by a friend as 'a quiet, young 
man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in 
the South Street Saloon just before closing time on the night of the fight.

According to a criminal complaint cited by NJ.com, 20-year-old Nelson was angry that night because a bouncer at the bar had hit on his girlfriend.

As he left the bar with his girlfriend, he saw Kolstad 
outside. The bouncer and Kolstad are different 
people.

Nelson
 and Kolstad got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch 
that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, 
according to a police officer, the 
complaint says.

Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that the attacker came 'out of nowhere'.

'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.'

He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance.

Kolstad suffered bleeding of the brain, 
skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of 
lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint.

He is now being treated at an inpatient rehabilitation program in the Twin Cities. There, he has bonded well with his new daughter, his wife Molly wrote.

'When I get to the hospital, he gives me a
 smile then reaches to hold Malia,' she said. 'When Malia cries he is the first to 
reach out and want to hold her and comfort her.'

Molly, a registered nurse who also has a three-year-old daughter with Kolstad, added that he is going from strength to strength in rehab, where he is undergoing occupational, recreational, physical and speech therapy.

She said that he is now up and walking with the help of two therapists who support his upper body, and he can now walk 1,500 feet a day.

'Isaac's interactions with us keep getting better as well,' she said. 'His laugh has always been one of my most favorite sounds and I am just so excited to be getting that back.'

She added: 'He continues to make great accomplishments at rehab for his brain injuries but still has an incredibly long road ahead.'
