CSKA Moscow were punished for grappling in the box during their 2-1 win over Manchester City on Wednesday night.

Sportsmail’s ‘Hands Off In The Box’ campaign continues to gather pace, with CSKA the latest offenders - and they were duly punished, albeit by Yaya Toure rather than referee Tasos Sidiropoulos.

City were awarded a free kick 25-yards out after eight minutes and as Yaya Toure stood over the ball, Sergei Ignashevich was grappling with Vincent Kompany, who had joined the CSKA wall.

Ignashevich bundled Kompany out of the wall but in doing so created a gap for Toure to curl the ball through and score to make it 1-1 on the night.

CSKA eventually went on to win an ill-tempered game, in which Toure was sent off for a moment of madness after he pushed XX to get a second yellow card.

Seydou Doumbia was again City's nemesis, following up his influential role in last month's 2-2 draw in Moscow with both CSKA goals. His Ivory Coast team-mate Toure had cancelled out his first with a superb free-kick - but City again lacked spark in Europe's elite competition.

The result left them with just two points from four games and bottom of the group.

City could have had two penalties in the dying minutes but Sergio Aguero, denied two spot-kicks in Sunday's Manchester derby, was twice refused again.

There were plenty of other issues surrounding the game, with no CSKA fans having officially been sold tickets but a number making themselves heard.
