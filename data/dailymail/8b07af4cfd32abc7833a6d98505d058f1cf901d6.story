Ligue 1 top scorer Alexandre Lacazette will not be heading for the Barclays Premier League next season, if Olympique Lyonnais president Jean-Michel Aulas is to be believed.

Lacazette has 21 league goals this season, more than any player in England's top division and only behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the Europe-wide goalscorer rankings.

And while the France international has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs, his president at Lyon says there is no way their star man will be crossing the channel. 

Alexandre Lacazette has 21 goals this season and his club Lyon are reluctant to see their top hit man leave

The 23-year-old admitted that he could move on in the summer but Lyon's president has refuted that

Lacazette has been linked Manchester City, Tottenham and Liverpool but amid speculation of a summer departure, Aulas has confirmed he will be keeping hold of the striker.

The 23-year-old told Lyon's TV channel on Thursday: 'I know that several clubs are watching me, but I will think about whether I want to leave or stay later on and then we shall see.

'At the moment I cannot say if I am staying or not, because if a club puts a certain amount of millions of euros on the table, the president will probably tell me to leave.'

Aulas responded to the talk of Lacazette leaving on his Twitter account, saying: 'Impossible. He will be with us at the (new) Stade des Lumieres and in the Champions League.'

Lyon lead the Ligue 1 table with 54 points from 27 games ahead of Chelsea's Champions League opponents Paris Saint-Germain.
