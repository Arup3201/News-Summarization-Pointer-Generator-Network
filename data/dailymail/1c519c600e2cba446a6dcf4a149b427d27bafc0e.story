A woman sparked an air rescue operation after she was knocked unconscious when she fell over her own dog while walking on a remote beach.

Marion Browner was fossil hunting with her family  near Cromarty, in the Scottish Highlands, when her fox terrier Nacho became tangled up in her legs.

The 50-year-old was knocked unconscious for several minutes after she struck her head on rocks. She woke up to find she had twisted her ankle and bruised her ribs.

Mrs Browner's family alerted paramedics who had to dispatch a Coastguard helicopter as the beach they were on was miles from the nearest road. Mrs Browner was airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.

She said: 'Things happened so quickly. I was in a lot of pain. It was so dramatic but there was no way I could walk.

'I was knocked out for maybe three or four minutes apparently but when I woke up I was pretty bleary and out of it.

'It's typical of Nacho really, she's always jumping about and is very excitable when out walking.

'I just lost sight of her and she got tangled up between my legs, the next thing I know I'm on my back unable to move.'

Mrs Browner and her husband, Sean, who run a bed-and-breakfast in Inverness, were at Ethie Haven, on the North Sea coast, on Sunday afternoon when the accident happened.

Her family, visiting from Australia, raised the alarm just after 1.30pm but the accident happened miles from the nearest road, meaning paramedics were unable reach them.

The Coastguard helicopter from Stornoway, Rescue 100, was sent out and Mrs Browner was winched on board and taken to Raigmore Hospital.

She said it had been a huge relief to see the aircraft overhead but was 'petrified' as she was winched up.

She said: 'I knew right away I had hurt myself badly.

'Fortunately, my brother-in-law Brendan, who is on holiday from Australia, was with us and, as he is a physiotherapist, he looked after me while we waited for the helicopter to arrive.

'A medic had come along and administered me with morphine because the pain was getting really bad.

'But when they were getting me onto the helicopter it was absolutely petrifying. It was really horrible to see myself get nearer and nearer the blades.

'I don't know if it was the morphine that was making me so scared.

'As well as banging my head, I also hurt my hip and ankle - which is causing me the most pain - and it had to be X-rayed to make sure it wasn't broken.' 

A spokeswoman for the ambulance service confirmed that a road ambulance had been called out after the alert was received at 1.45pm.

She said: 'We were called to assist the Coastguard and tried to reach the casualty on foot, but were unable to do so.

'The Coastguard helicopter transported her to Raigmore Hospital with ankle injuries, which were not thought to be serious.'

Treatment: The 50-year-old was knocked unconscious for several minutes after hitting her head on rocks. Above, the Coastguard arrive to help Mrs Browner - who was miles away from the nearest road
