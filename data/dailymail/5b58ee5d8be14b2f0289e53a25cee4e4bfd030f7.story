Mario Balotelli's 'miserable' performance summed up 'lightweight' Liverpool during their 1-0 defeat by Basle in the Champions League, according to Graeme Souness.

The Anfield legend believes Balotelli, who failed to touch the ball in the penalty area as Liverpool lost, epitomised Brendan Rodgers' side's disappointing night in Switzerland.

Speaking on Sky Sports on Wednesday night, Souness said: 'I think he summed up what Liverpool were about tonight. How many times did you see him and he ended up limping after any sort of challenge on him?

'He was complaining to the referee, he gave away possession far too easily and he wasn't alone in that and I thought he had another miserable night.

'Yes, he's got ability of a type and produced a great free-kick in the second half, but he doesn't do enough for me.

Souness, who won three European Cups with Liverpool, believes the current vintage now face an uphill battle to qualify from Group B with Real Madrid at home and away next up in the Champions League. 

Claiming Liverpool were 'lightweight', the Scot also said the side's lack of bite in midfield was a contributing factor in Wednesday's defeat.

'Tonight they were lightweight,' insisted Souness. 'You can talk all you want about tactics and formations, but if every one of the midfielders isn't winning challenges and the other team keeps taking the ball off you then you're always going to be on the back foot.

'They played against a Basle team, who are arguably - when you look at the two games in the group - worse than Ludogorets. Real Madrid did not have an easy trip there.

'Liverpool still have to go there and after the next two games against Real Madrid they could find themselves in a very difficult situation.
