A dog owner hit with a £7,500 bill to save his sick pet turned to drug smuggling to raise money to clear his debts, a court heard.

Newly-married Ceri Morgan, 38, was forced to cancel his Las Vegas honeymoon last year to help pay to treat his bulldog Teeto who had cancer.

He then tried to import £25,000 of the drug 'meow meow' to fund his dog's expensive treatment, Swansea Crown Court heard.

Beloved dog: Ceri Morgan, 38, turned to drug dealing to help clear his debts after spending £7,500 to treat his bulldog Teeto who had cancer

But Morgan, from Morriston, South Wales, who married his wife Claire, 26, last year, was caught and was jailed for 18 months for importing the illegal substance.

He was tracked down after a one kilogram package of drugs was stopped by customs officials in East Midlands Airport on August 2.

Cancer: The dog had to have its front right leg removed after undergoing chemotherapy treatment

It had been sent from a company called 'Shanghai Trading Company' to a made-up recipient called Dean Cook.

The Class B drugs package would have cost around £2,500 to buy but had a street value of up to £25,000.

Prosecutor Frank Phillips said: 'The package was addressed to a house in Morriston in Swansea but police found Morgan's phone number on a invoice inside.'

Police raided Morgan's home at Clase, Swansea, and found his iPhone and computer hard drive had been used to try track the package and to search for the Shanghai Trading Company.

Mr Phillips said: 'A text message was also found where police believed Morgan had referenced that he had "only gone and got" a kilo of the drug.'

Before his arrest for drug smuggling, garage worker Ceri, 36, said he had no hesitation in cancelling his honeymoon to pay his vet bills.

He said: 'We were looking forward to our dream honeymoon but Teeto had to come first.

'He's such a special dog, we had no hesitation. We had to use the money for his vets bills.'

Poorly Teeto had his right leg amputated and underwent a course of chemotherapy to fight the cancer in his right shoulder.

Bride Clare, 26, said at the time: 'We told the vet that it didn't matter about the money, just do whatever it takes to make him better.'

Dog lovers: Ceri with his new wife Clare Morgan at home in Swansea. They cancelled their Las Vegas' honeymoon to pay for the dog's treatment. Now he has been jailed for 18 months for importing drugs

Morgan admitted importing the drug and a second charge of attempting to supply it. He had no previous convictions for drugs offences.

Robin Rouch, for Morgan, said his client was working with someone else and said it was 'not difficult' to import drugs from the Far East.

He said he had been driven to commit the offence because of financial problems which stemmed from the illness of the family pet.

Judge Peter Heywood said: 'Meow meow use in Swansea was becoming an acute problem and was reaching epidemic proportions.

'It's become very much the drug of choice in this city, hardly a week goes by when reference to meow meow isn't appearing in these courts.'
