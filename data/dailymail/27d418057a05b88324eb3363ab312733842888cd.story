Disney is adding Twitter Chairman and Square CEO Jack Dorsey to its board of directors.

Walt Disney Co. says Dorsey is joining the board effective immediately. He will stand for election to a full term at the company's annual meeting on March 18.

Dorsey, 37, co-founded Twitter. He has been chairman of the company since 2008 and was also Twitter's first CEO.

Donning the ears: Jack Dorsey has joined the Disney board

'Jack Dorsey is a talented entrepreneur who has helped create groundbreaking new businesses in the social media and commerce spaces,' said Robert A. Iger, Disneyâ€™s chairman and chief executive officer.

'The perspective he brings to Disney and its Board is extremely valuable, given our strategic priorities, which include utilizing the latest technologies and platforms to reach more people and to enhance the relationship we have with our customers.'

Dorsey will replace Judith Estrin on Disney's board.

Estrin has been on the board for 15 years and can't run for a new term under the Burbank, California, company's corporate rules. She is a former executive for Cisco Systems and now runs JLABS LLC.

Dorsey attended New York University and Missouri University of Science and Technology.

In a recent profile in the New Yorker, he mentioned that despite all of his achievements in the tech world, he's got even bigger plans for the future.

The California resident would like to move to New York city and someday run for mayor.

Dorsey has the honor of being the person who sent the first-ever tweet in March 2006: 'Just setting up my twttr,' he wrote.

Today he took to the social media site to comment on his new appointment. '"I only hope we don't lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse." - Walt Disney,' he wrote, accompanied by an old sketch of Mickey Mouse.
