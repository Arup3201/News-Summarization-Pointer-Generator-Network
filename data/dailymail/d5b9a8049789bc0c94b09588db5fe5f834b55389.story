The daughter of University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban is once again in legal troubles stemming from a boozy brawl with a sorority sister over a Facebook post that ended in punches and a broken nose.

Kristen Saban, daughter of the legendary Alabama coach, was being sued for $10,000 by fellow Phi Mu sister Sarah Grimes, who claims she was brutally beaten over a Facebook post following a night of drinking games. 

Back in March, a Tuscaloosa judge ruled that Saban was only defending herself and dismissed the lawsuit.

But on Friday, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed that decision, saying that there is enough of a dispute about what happened for the case to move forward. The lawsuit, first filed in June 2012, has now been fully reinstated.

The fight happened in the wee hours on Aug. 29, 2010, after a night of drinking at Rounders, a local bar in Tuscaloosa.

The two sorority sisters and five other girlfriends were hanging out in Saban's apartment when they began to bicker over a boyfriend. Grimes told Saban to 'shut up' and that 'others were tired of listening to her,' according to court documents.

Grimes told Saban she 'needed to get therapy' because she was a 'psycho' — to which Saban fired back: 'Because that worked really well for you,' court records show.

Saban then locked herself in the bathroom, and posted on her Facebook: 'No one likes Sarah, Yayyyyy!' 

That's where things get murky — which each of the sorority sisters claiming in legal papers that the other beat her badly.

In her testimony, Grimes says that Saban 'used both of her hands and shoved her into an open door frame,' where she hit her head.

Grimes says she put 'one hand on [Saban's] throat, one hand on her chest, and threw her back' to try to get away. 

But Saban bounced back on top of her and 'hit her in the face more than five times,' leaving Grimes bleeding 'all over the floor and all over herself,' running down her face and into her bra.

Grimes later testified that she had 'extensive' injuries, including a swelling on her left temple and a black eye.

Saban, on the other hand, tells a different story.

She said in legal papersthat, after she posted on Facebook, Grimes rushed over to confront her and began banging on her door.

'She was screaming at me to take it off and cursing, and I finally took it off, and I opened the door, and I showed her,' Saban testified, according to court records. 'I had my phone out, and I said, "It's off. It's off."

'And then she took both of her hands and put them around my throat.'

Saban added there was 'just a lot of slapping and punching, not many [punches] landing, and scratching.' Her injuries including a broken nose and scratches on her back, she testified.

In her suit, Grimes claims she was hurt so badly she suffered a concussion, an increase in migraine headaches, had nasal surgery and required psychological help.

'As a result of the beating and the head injuries Sarah Grimes sustained by Kristen Saban, Sarah has had repeated night terrors, anxiety, physical trembling, fears of dying from brain injuries, trouble sleeping, and intrusive recollections of the event,' the lawsuit said.

Saban's lawyer argued that Grimes was responsible for her own injuries.

The dismissal motion also said insurance covered Grimes' medical costs, so Kristen Saban shouldn't have to pay.

Kristen Saban pleaded guilty to an unspecified offense before the university's judicial board but was not prosecuted criminally, according to the suit. It said she was required to undergo psychological screening and take an anger management class.

A 2009 news release from the university about sorority recruitment identified both Grimes, of Pensacola, Florida, and Kristen Saban as new members of Phi Mu.
