A man arrested in the killings of two women in a Denver apartment on Wednesday told investigators that he doesn't remember why he allegedly shot his roommate and her friend.

The two women shot and killed Wednesday night have been identified as 19-year-old Amanda Anders and her friend, 22-year-old Nancy Worrell.

The Denver Medical Examiner says both women were shot multiple times.

Jose King was arrested shortly after the shooting by Castle Rock officers doing a welfare check when King's father asked them to check on him after he had an unusual visit from his son.

'I don't remember': Alleged murderer of two women, Jose King, told police that he doesn't remember why 'he shot his roommate and her friend'

The Denver Post reported that after the shooting, King allegedly fled to his parents' home in Castle Rock and met with his father.

He kept 'apologizing for something that he had done and saying he came to say goodbye,' the affidavit said.

King was later discovered by police driving around half-naked in an SUV. 

That's when he allegedly told police that he had 'done a bad thing tonight.'

He also asked police to take him to jail.

Police say King had been apologizing and saying goodbye. 

Roommate: Jose King allegedly killed his roommate Amanda J. Anders after arguing about something he told police that he doesn't remember 

Roommate's friend: Nancy Worrell, 22, was at her friend Amanda J. Anders' house the night that she was shot

Anders' father, Steven Anders, said she was independent, living on her own and chasing her dreams.

She always wanted to be an artist and was a student at Metro State University.

According to her Facebook page, Worrell was a culinary student.

King is being held without bond. He was in court for his first advisement Friday morning and will likely be formally charged with two counts of first-degree murder sometime next week.

Overwhelmed next-door neighbor Basil Jaddoa told reporters he heard blood curdling screams at King's home and gun shots before going to investigate.

 He found the women sprawled out dead in the apartment's doorway, laying in a pool of their own  blood, he said.

'There was blood everywhere,' Jaddoa said.

Other neighbors told reporters that they were very alarmed and that the incident was unexpected.
