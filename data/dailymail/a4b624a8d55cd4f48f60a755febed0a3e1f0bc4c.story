An international karate champion who sent a 13-year-old girl nearly 5,000 texts in eight months and told her he wanted to leave his wife for her faces jail after being convicted of child abuse.

Liam O’Grady, a world and European gold medallist who has taught hundreds of children at after-school clubs, collapsed in the dock as he was found guilty by a jury after a seven-day trial.

The court heard that the 30-year-old father of two was addicted to sending sex messages and told the girl their relationship was ‘only illegal if the law knew’.

Guilty: Karate champion Liam O'Grady, pictured here with his wife Lisa, was remanded in custody after a court heard he bombarded the 13-year-old with almost 5,000 sexual texts

He sent her 4,759 messages over the course of their eight-month sexual relationship.

He had to be removed from court and 
was too distraught to return to the dock to hear the Recorder of York, 
Judge Stephen Ashurst, remand him in custody after his conviction on 
Friday.

The jury heard that he sexually abused the girl in his house, his car and men’s toilets.

The girl and her friends had to give evidence in the trial after 
O’Grady, of York, denied four charges of sexual activity with a child 
and one of meeting a child after sexually grooming her.

He was acquitted
of one of the sexual activity charges and convicted of all other 
charges. He spent Christmas in jail after the judge at York Crown Court 
refused him bail.

O’Grady’s wife Lisa, who gave evidence in his defence, cried as the verdicts were read out.

O’Grady told the court during the trial that months after meeting his 
wife in 2001, he began sending sexually flirtatious texts to women.

He 
said the texts were a ‘distraction from the realities of life’, and 
added: ‘It’s just flirting with these ladies and making them want more 
than I do.

'I told the women that I was in love with them and I would 
leave my wife for them.’

Christine Egerton, prosecuting, read out texts O’Grady had sent to the  13-year-old girl.

One, about his plans to spend a Sunday with her, included: ‘Well, maybe a
couple of hours in bed’. Another message said: ‘It’s only illegal if 
the law knows’, followed by ‘Or your mum’.

About his wife, he texted: ‘She is jealous of you, you’re thinner, fitter and more beautiful than her.’

A schoolgirl told the jury that she and other pupils were so concerned 
about their friend’s rumoured affair with O’Grady, they told a member of
staff. ‘We told her she shouldn’t, she should just leave it,’ the girl 
said. ‘One day, we just went to our teacher.’

Detective Inspector Shaun Page said: ‘I hope the verdict makes O’Grady 
face up to the fact that what he has done is sick and completely 
unacceptable. He held a position of trust which he completely abused.’

The Karate Union of Great Britain, which has suspended O’Grady, said it 
would consider his situation after he is sentenced next month.
