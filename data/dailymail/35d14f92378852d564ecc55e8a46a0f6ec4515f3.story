One of Bryan Ferry's sons avoided jail yesterday after being caught carrying  a knife for a second time.

Merlin Ferry, 22, had told police to go away and 'investigate real crime' when he was found with the weapon.

Officers stopped the student in his uninsured Saab and were searching for drugs when they arrested him for carrying the knife. He told the officers: 'You can unarrest me now.

Merlin Ferry, pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court, has been warned he will face jail if caught carrying a knife again

And he continued to show no remorse 
yesterday, complaining about being forced to get up early to travel to 
court from his Shropshire home.

The Marlborough-educated student 
received a community order after the judge delivered a stern lecture on 
the  dangers of knife crime.

The sentence comes just two years 
after a case was dropped when he was stopped while carrying a Gurkha 
knife. His lawyer successfully argued that weapon – known as a Kukri  – 
was part of a fancy dress outfit he was wearing to a student party.

Ferry, who is studying in Barcelona, 
was subjected to a lengthy dressing down yesterday at Isleworth Crown 
Court, in West London.

Judge Paul Dugdale told him that 
coming from a privileged background does not mean the 'normal rules' do 
not apply to him, and warned him of the dangers of carrying a knife

'You could walk down the corridor here
at Isleworth and go into a courtroom and hear a case where someone had 
their face opened by a knife and were scarred for life.

Ferry's brother Otis was one of the pro-hunt protesters, pictured in white T-shirts, who pushed into the House of Commons in 2004 during a fox hunt debate

'That was caused by somebody who had a knife, problems arose, things happened and it ended up being used.

'You know of the number of deaths and
murders in London that are caused because people have knives in their 
pockets and somebody is left dead: that is why there are a large number 
of people calling for a minimum of one year's custody for somebody 
caught with a knife.'

The judge said many would have 
expected that the 'penny would have dropped' after the first knife 
incident. He added: 'Those that have the chance to make a success of 
their lives without the normal hardship of life are very lucky.

'It has taken a bit of time for you to
realise that luck and good fortune does not take you out of the normal 
world or that normal rules do not apply to you.

Judge Paul Dugdale told Merlin Ferry that he was 'very lucky' to come from such a privileged background and as the son of Bryan Ferry, pictured, does not have the 'normal hardship of life'

Judge Paul Dugdale sentenced Ferry at Isleworth Crown Court to a 12-months community order and 100 hours community service and ordered him to pay £500 costs

Otis Ferry was found guilty in October of failing to provide a breath sample

'You are just another young man 
carrying a knife and that makes you very frightening to people and that 
is why people think I should send you to prison.

'If you carry a bladed article again 
in public again you will spend six months of your life in Wormwood 
Scrubs and the consequences on your lucky life so far will be 
devastating. Don't think that will not happen, it will.'

Ferry's probation officer said he had 
shown 'no remorse' for the danger to the public he posed or the cost of 
bringing him to justice. The official said he 'lacked insight into the 
offence' and had said knife crime was something 'to do with London and 
people on estates'.

Ferry was stopped by police in his 
silver Saab in Chelsea on September 29 last year. When asked if he had 
anything in his pocket which could injure the officers as they searched 
for drugs he said 'yes' and pulled out the lock-knife.

He was arrested and told officers 'you
can just unarrest me now' before claiming the knife was a present from a
friend who had just returned from Greece.

Ferry's mother is former model Lucy 
Helmore, who divorced Roxy Music star Bryan Ferry in 2003. His 
old-Etonian older brother Otis, 29, has been arrested several times over
his pro-hunting activism, including protesting inside the House of 
Commons. He also has a conviction for drink-driving.

Ferry, who admitted possessing a 
bladed article, was placed on a 12-month community order, which includes
100 hours' community service. He was ordered to pay £500 costs. He was 
also given six penalty points for having no insurance and was 
disqualified for six months under totting up rules.
