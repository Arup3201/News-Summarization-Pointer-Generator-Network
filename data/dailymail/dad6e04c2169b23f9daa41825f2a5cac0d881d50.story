Debts: Anita Harris has worked tirelessly in recent years to overcome her financial woes

She was once one of Britain’s highest paid stars with a glittering career that included hit records, starring roles in the West End and even a cabaret spot in Las Vegas.

But now actress Anita Harris has been declared bankrupt because of tens of thousands of pounds in unpaid taxes.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that both Harris and her TV director husband Michael Margolis had a bankruptcy petition filed against them by the taxman at Kingston upon Thames County Court.

Sources say that Harris owed in excess of £14,000, while Margolis had personal liabilities of just over £25,000.

The bankruptcy, which is detailed in records seen by The Mail on Sunday, is the latest humiliation for the star, who has been plagued by financial woes.

In 1985 she was forced to rebuild her career after the collapse of a Swiss bank cost the couple £1 million as well as their luxury London home.

The pair soon re-established a comfortable lifestyle thanks in part to Harris’s role in the West End musical Cats, and in 1991 they bought a new home in Barnes, South-West London.

But in 2007 they were forced to sell the property to settle a string of debts, and two years later were evicted from a flat after failing to pay seven months’ rent.

Harris, 72, shot to fame as a singer in the 1960s before landing starring roles in movies including two Carry On films.

She also established herself as a cabaret star, and by the 1970s was enjoying success in Las Vegas and at the prestigious Talk Of The Town nightclub in London.

TV stardom quickly followed and she found herself co-hosting the popular David Nixon Magic Show.

In recent years Harris, who now lives in a ramshackle rented cottage in Surrey, has thrown herself into work in an effort to remain solvent. She has just finished panto in York and is on a nationwide tour. In march she will make an appearance on BBC drama Casualty.

Last night her promoter Peter Gill said he had no idea if the star had been declared bankrupt. He said: ‘I really can’t comment because I really don’t know. As far as I am concerned she’s very busy and doing very well.’

A spokesman for the Insolvency Service said: ‘The bankruptcy petition against Anita Harris and Michael Margolis was filed by solicitors acting on behalf of HMRC. We cannot give details of the amounts owed to anyone who is not a creditor.’

Both Harris and Margolis were unavailable for comment when The Mail on Sunday visited their home.
