A Chinese-American businessman has reportedly paid a half million dollars to spent '45 minutes to an hour' with Bill and Hillary Clinton.

And when the mogul asked if he could bring his kids along, he was told it would cost him double - $1million. He left his children home.

The New York Post reports that Charitybuzz CEO Coppy Holzman was over-heard at a swanky Hamptons party telling guests about the incident.

The $500,000 donation means that the Chinese business mogul was paying $8,300 a minute to spend time with Bill and Hillary Clinton. And that's if the Clintons spent the whole hour with him

The lunch - without the kids - cost more than $8,300 a minute. And that's if the Clintons spent the whole hour with the donor.

The businessman won a Mary 29 charity auction to spend time with the Clintons. Proceeds went to the $250million Clinton Foundation.

The Post claims that a source overheard Charitybuzz CEO Coppy Holzman gab about the charity auction

Mr Holzman, according to the Post told party guests, 'lunch for two with Bill and Hillary went for $500,000 to benefit the Clinton Foundation.'

Holtzman said the winning bidder 'then asked if he could bring his two children along to the meeting.'

The Post 
reports that the Clinton camp told the donor that it would cost 
$1milllion for his children to meet the former President and First Lady,
 as well. 

The Post's tipster told the newspaper, 'The couple opted to leave the children at home.'

The
 Clinton Foundation told the Post that it was CharityBuzz, which ran the
 May 29 auction, that was responsible for the $1million figure.

'Without our knowledge, the CharityBuzz staff decided to ask him if he 
would be interested in adding more people to the lunch for an additional
 donation. We don’t know if they specified an amount.' a spokesman said.
