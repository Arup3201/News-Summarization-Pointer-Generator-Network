Confession: Beverly Rolston reportedly confessed to putting up lewd posters across an Ohio Walmart

An angry wife has been charged after being caught on security camera putting up obscene posters outing her husband and his mistress at an Ohio Walmart. 

Beverly Rolston, 45, confessed to distributing posters which included images of a man and woman engaged in a sex act with the words 'Hide your Husbands'.

They also included pictures of the woman's husband, Robert, and her ex-friend, Amy Kreiner who is an employee at the Towne Boulevard Walmart store.

According to WLWT, Rolston and the Walmart employee had been friends before Rolston accused the woman of having an affair with her husband.

Police noted the posters outed the affair and 'were posted in plain view of all the public, including children to see'.

According to The Smoking Gun, the betrayed woman entered the store at midnight on November 25 and put the posters up around the electronic department where her husband's 'lover' is based.

She reportedly confessed when later quizzed by police. 

Her husband also admitted the year-long affair in a police interview, the report claims.

Rolston faced a felony charge of pandering obscenities but the grand jury declined to pursue it.

Prosecutors have now put forward a charge of disorderly conduct.

Her case remains in Middletown Municipal Court where she is scheduled for arraignment on March 21.
