Cristiano Ronaldo surpassed former Real Madrid team-mate Raul's Champions League goalscoring total by claiming his 72nd in the competition to close in on record-holder Lionel Messi.

The Portuguese superstar cut the gap on rival Messi to just two goals before Gareth Bale doubled Real Madrid's lead in the 38th minute when his headed effort flew past keeper Vladislav Stoyanov.

Substitutes Alvaro Arbeloa and Alvaro Medran scored late on to pile misery on Ludogorets, who were down to 10 men after just 19 minutes.

The European champions dominated possession throughout the early exchanges but their opening goal came from the penalty spot after Marcelinho used his hand to stop a goalbound effort by Raphael Varane.

Marcelinho was subsequently shown a red card by French referee Clement Turpin before Ronaldo converted the resulting penalty.

Ludogorets were made to pay for Marcelinho's misdemeanour as Bale was allowed to leap above the Bulgarian outfit's defence to score his eighth goal of the season.

The Welshman's effort nestled into the back of the net after hitting the underside of the crossbar shortly before the interval.

Both Javier Hernandez and Bale had chances to add to Real Madrid's lead but their attempts at goal were easily saved by Stoyanov.

Jese was handed the opportunity to make his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabeu since rupturing his cruciate ligament during a Champions League match against Schalke back in March.

Substitute Arbeloa scored his first goal of the season in the 79th minute when his low drive crossed the line despite the best efforts of Stoyanov.

Spanish starlet Medran, who replaced an injured Bale in the 83rd minute, netted his first Champions League goal with two minutes left on the clock when his effort was deflected into the net. 

Bale was forced off after sustaining a bloody nose during the final stages of the encounter when Georgi Terziev's hand caught him in the face.

The win ensures Real Madrid ended the group stages with maximum points having beaten Basle, Liverpool and Ludogorets at the Santiago Bernabeu and away from home. 

They also won all six Champions League group games under Jose Mourinho in 2011-12, a feat previously achieved by four other clubs - AC Milan in 1992-93, Paris St Germain in 1994-95, Spartak Moscow in 1995-96 and Barcelona in 2002-03. 

Carlo Ancelotti's side also set a Spanish record having won their last 19 games since losing to rivals Atletico Madrid on September 13.

Brazilian side Coritiba hold the overall record for most consecutive wins in all competitions, according to Guinness World Records.

The South Americans won 24 straight games between February and May 2011 spread between the Paranaense state championship and the Brazilian Cup. 

Ludogorets, on the other hand, were beaten to a spot in the Europa League by Liverpool. 

Ancelotti said after the impressive win: 'I have an extraordinary group (of players) and I never tire of saying it.

'I could not imagine winning 19 games in a row after the defeat to Atletico. I knew we would fix what had not gone well but not in this way.'
