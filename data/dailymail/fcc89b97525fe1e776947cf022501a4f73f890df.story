He survived the horrors of the Vietnam War, but Navy Veteran Charles Hubbard has been left fighting for his very life - thanks to hapless government bureaucrats who have declared him dead.

Mr Hubbard, 59, was stunned to receive a letter from the Department of Veteran Affairs informing him not only that he had died earlier this year but that his family must to pay back over $5,000 in benefits.

After reassuring his daughter and granddaughters that he was still very much alive, Mr Hubbard assumed it would be a simple procedure to do the same with government.

Alive and kicking: But Vietnam veteran Charles Hubbard received a letter from the government informing him he had died

But incredibly the Veteran's Department told him it could take up to eight months before he can be officially brought back to life.

Mr Hubbard is supposed to receive a government pension of $1,000 a month, but hasn't received a penny in over three months meaning he has no money to pay bills or buy food.

He told Kens5.com: 'I died on Jan 15 this year.

'The VA said I was deceased, and they closed my checking account when the bank found out.'

Mr Hubbard could easily have been left without a roof over his head because he was unable to payÂ  for his housing. But fortunately his landlord kindly agreed to charge him only $25 a month until he gets his pension back.

He added: 'We got a food bank here, and the one at the church where I go to. That's where I get my food from.'

Mr Hubbard, from Austin, Texas, believes his problems began after a man stole his identity and used it to get treatment at a California hospital.

After the imposter passed away Mr Hubbard received an enormous bill for his 'treatment'.

He explained: 'When I received a hospital bill of almost $300,000 in California I said, "Hold on," and [then] they called me, they [wanted] me to pay it.

'I keep calling. They say it could take up to eight months'.
