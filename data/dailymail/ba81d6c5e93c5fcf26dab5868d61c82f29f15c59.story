Andy Carroll spent the afternoon at a waterpark with girlfriend Billi Mucklow as he relaxes in Dubai.

The West Ham striker is on England's World Cup standby list but headed for a break with the former The Only Way is Essex star.

Carroll, one of seven players on Roy Hodgson's reserve list, took part in some yoga earlier this week to keep himself in shape.

The former Newcastle man took to the beach to practice yoga to keep himself in shape just in case he gets the call to go to the tournament in South America.

He could have been getting some yoga tips from the former TOWIE star who is a yoga instructor back home in Essex.

On Monday Carroll made it clear he was hoping to be on the plane to Brazil.
