Semesa Rokoduguni is a lance corporal in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guard. Read Chris Foy's interview with England's new man from back in May here.

England have named Fijian-born solider Semesa Rokoduguni in their Elite Player squad along with uncapped Saracens lock George Kruis ahead of the upcoming QBE Series.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster on Wednesday unveiled his core 33-man squad ahead of the four Test series with the uncapped Rokoduguni included ahead of the vastly more Chris Ashton. As revealed in Sportsmail, Rokoduguni’s selection is reward for some sensational form in only his second full season as a professional rugby player while Ashton’s omission is a serious blow to his hopes of featuring in next year’s World Cup.

Backs: Brad Barritt (Saracens) Mike Brown (Harlequins), Luther Burrell (Northampton), Danny Care (Harlequins), Lee Dickson (Northampton), Kyle Eastmond (Bath), Owen Farrell (Saracens), George Ford (Bath), Alex Goode (Saracens), Jonathan Joseph (Bath), Jonny May (Gloucester), Stephen Myler (Northampton), Jack Nowell (Exeter), Semesa Rokoduguni (Bath), Billy Twelvetrees (Gloucester), Marland Yarde (Harlequins), Ben Youngs (Leicester).

Forwards: Dave Attwood (Bath), Kieran Brookes (Leicester), Calum Clark (Northampton), Dylan Hartley (Northampton), James Haskell (Wasps), George Kruis (Saracens), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Ben Morgan (Gloucester), Matt Mullan (Wasps), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens), R Webber (Bath), David Wilson (Bath), Tom Wood (Northampton).

Rokoduguni is one of four wingers named, alongside Marland Yarde, Jack Nowell and Jonny May while in-form Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani is another notable absentee, with Lancaster opting for the more prosaic skills of Stephen Myler as his third-choice fly half behind Owen Farrell and George Ford. Gloucester’s Freddie Burns also misses out.

Jonathan Joseph replaces the injured Manu Tuilagi with Billy Twelvetrees, Brad Barritt, Kyle Eastmond and Luther Burrell named as the other centres.

Explaining his selections, Lancaster said: 'We have had some injuries but I'm excited about the form of those selected. Especially Calum Clark and George Kruis.

'I don't think Danny Cipriani has gone backwards. If you look at Stephen Myler he has executed his skills better than anyone I'm the premiership. We look for consistency and he was unlucky not to start the first test in New Zealand.'

Rokoduguni’s inclusion completes an extraordinary transition for the Afghanistan war veteran, who only signed professional papers with Bath in 2012 after director of rugby Mike Ford spotted him playing for the Army in a friendly against Newcastle and brought him to the Recreation Ground on trial the following season.

Lancaster said: 'Rokoduguni is an exciting prospect and we've talked about starting him. I know (coaches) Mike Catt and Andy Farrell are looking forward to working with him.'

On, Tuesday, Rokoduguni said: ‘It has been my target over the last two seasons to play international rugby with England. I’m pretty confident with the way I’m playing. I feel ready for the step up. 

‘Back in my village I played rugby but I wasn’t the first-choice winger. I trained hard every single day and still didn’t get picked. I was always told there was someone who was a better winger than me.’

Up front, Northampton flanker Calum Clark – banned for 32 weeks in 2012 for breaking Leicester hooker Rob Hawkins’ arm – is one of Lancaster’s back-row selections along with captain Chris Robshaw, Tom Wood, James Haskell, Ben Morgan and Billy Vunipola.

With Geoff Parling injured, uncapped Saracens lock Kruis earns the fourth second-row spot, following a string of impressive domestic and European displays, alongside Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes and Dave Attwood with Dylan Hartley and Rob Webber are named as hookers, with Matt Mullan, Dave Wilson, Joe Marler and Kieran Brookes the four props named.

Lancaster will bring seven more players into his squad on Sunday with Exeter’s uncapped centre Henry Slade among those set to be called up.

England open their QBE autumn series against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8 before facing South Africa, Samoa and Australia on successive weekends.
