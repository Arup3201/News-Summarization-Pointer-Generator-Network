Stephen Fry has admitted in his soon-to-be-released third autobiography to having spent an 'enormous amount' of time and money on cocaine.

The actor, presenter and celebrity has revealed the extent of his  drug use in his book 'More Fool Me', which follows on from his two previous autobiographies released in 1997 and 2010.

The revelation was made in the Sunday Times in anticipation of the release of his new book in four days' time.

Presenter and actor Stephen Fry reveals the extent of his cocaine use in his latest autobiography

He wrote: 'The only point of writing an autobiography, or so at least it seems to me, is to be honest.

'And in this book I have been utterly candid about a period of my life in which I spent an enormous amount of time and money on cocaine powder.

'I know how stupid that is, but I also know better people than me have found themselves on the same path.'

Fry has previously gone public with a number of tumultuous incidents in his life.

The actor and presenter, who has a history of depression, admitted last year for the first time that he was in a hotel room abroad when he tried to kill himself in 2012.

In an interview with fellow comedian Richard Herring for the Leicester Square Theatre Podcast, Fry said that as president of mental health charity Mind, he felt he should talk about his own episodes of depression.

'I am the victim of my own moods, more than most people are perhaps, in as much as I have a condition which requires me to take medication so that I don't get either too hyper or too depressed to the point of suicide,' said Fry, who first disclosed contemplating killing himself 19 years ago.

'I would go as far as to tell you that I attempted it last year, so I'm not always happy. This is the first time I've said this in public, but I might as well.'

Fry, who hosts panel show QI, has long been open about suffering from bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression.

The illness is characterised by episodes of mania and depression, with extreme episodes often lasting for several weeks.

About one in every 100 people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, with between 25 and 56 per cent of sufferers making at least one suicide attempt.

Talking about his experience with the illness, Fry added: 'If un-medicated, there are times when I am so exuberant, so hyper, that I can go three or four nights without sleeping and I'm writing and I'm doing stuff and I'm so grandiose and so full of self-belief that it's almost impossible to deal with me.

'I can't stop speaking, I'm incredible, I go on shopping sprees.'
