Vermont authorities are warning residents in advance of a high-risk pedophile being released from prison Friday.

Residents are being told to be extra cautious with their children as a high risk pedophile is set to be released from a state prison Friday, with 12 to 13-year-old blond-haired, blue-eyed boys said to be at highest risk, according to reports.

'It's 
terrible they're letting him out. Once a pedophile, always a 
pedophile,' Springfield, VT. resident Jamie Hooper said.

Pervert: Timothy Szad received a 13-year setnece after admitting to carrying a 13-year-old autistic boy across a river, handcuffing and repeatedly sexually assaulting him, he will be released from prison Friday

Timothy Szad, 53, was sentenced to 13
years in prison after handcuffing and repeatedly sexually assaulting a 
13-year-old autistic boy in 2000. With his sentence coming to an end 
Friday, authorities are warning the public he is at risk for 
re-offending, according to reports.

Szad is required to notify the state of where he chooses to live, but he will not be under supervision.

The pedophile received his sentence after agreeing to a plea deal that spared the boy from having to testify to Szad grabbing him, carrying him across a river, handcuffing and sexually assaulting him multiple times, according to the Burlington Free Press.

Szad admitted to these acts in exchange for a lighter sentence than the maximum 20 years he would have faced if the case went to trial, the paper reported.

Despite taking part in a sex offender treatment program, prison officials determined Szad is at high risk to offend again, according to reports. His most likely target would be blonde haired, blue eyed boys 12 to 13-years of age.

Authorities’ efforts to notify the public in advance of the pervert being released have scuttled plans he had to move in with his parents, according to reports, leading to him potentially being homeless.

‘I wouldn't want him in my neighborhood. I don't think that you or anybody else would,’Rep. Kurt Wright, (R-Burlington) told WCAX.

Szad’s case is renewing the push for Vermont to pass a civil confinement law meant to keep sex offenders with an inability to control their impulses off the streets indefinitely through confinement in a mental institution, according to reports.

Despite the concern caused by Szad's release, he does have his defenders, including the American Civil Liberties Union.

'We 
live in a society that operates by the rule of law,' Allen 
Gilbert, executive director of the ACLU's Vermont chapter, said, adding 'courts 
have determined the appropriate sentence for him, he's served his sentence, and 
now he's getting out.'

Another resident nearby the Springfield prison Szad is set to be released from expressed hope he would emerge a reformed man.

'Hopefully 
if he's coming here, he'll commit to living a decent life,' Russell Hill said.

Stranger danger: Vermont officials are warning residents in advance of Szad's release from this Vermont prison, saying that 12 to 13-year-old blond haired, blue eyed boys are at highest risk of abuse by Szad

The state legislature rejected passage of a civil confinement measure in 2007, citing the expense and high burden of proof needed to indefinitely commit an individual such as Szad, reports said.

‘I don't know whether the Legislature would be willing to go down that path. I've always believed it was a mistake not to pass it,’ Wright continued.

Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin (D) told WCAX that he would strongly consider signing such a measure if passed by the state legislature, adding that he’s for ‘anything that the Legislature and we can do to make this state safer from pedophiles.’

Andy Bladyka, Springfield director of parks and recreation, said he had been 
consulting with the police chief and town manager about Szad's release, but as 
of Wednesday, no special precautions were being planned within Springfield's 
summer youth programs.

On alert: Several small town in Vermont, such as Springfield, where the prison Szad will be released from is located, are being warned to be more careful with their children after the convicted pedophile is set free Friday

Small town USA: Springfield, which was named the official hometown of the Simpsons and in 2007 hosted the animated movie's premiere, are being told by officials to look out for Timothy Szad

He said staff and volunteers are already trained with security in mind. For 
example, he said, they are told not to leave a child alone after a program but 
to ensure that each one has safe transportation home.

20 states, including New York and New Hampshire, currently have civil confinement measures in place.

In a New York courtroom on Tuesday, former New York Gov. George Pataki 
defended himself in a lawsuit brought by six convicted sex offenders who said 
their constitutional rights were violated under a civil commitment law initiated 
by Pataki.

State Rep. Alice Emmons, a Springfield lawmaker who chairs the House 
committee that oversees Vermont's prisons, said she opposes civil commitment 
laws.

"You're holding someone who has not committed a (new) crime. Do we as a 
society in Vermont want to do that?" she asked.

It is not clear if Szad had any criminal history prior to this conviction, repeated attempts to reach state and local officials for further information were unsuccessful.
