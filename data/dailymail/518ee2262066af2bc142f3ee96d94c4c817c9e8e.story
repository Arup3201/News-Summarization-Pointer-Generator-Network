This house is branching out from the norm by completely circling a 40-foot tree with glass walls.

The bespoke 'Tree in a House' design is nestled in the mountainous forests of Almaty, Kazakhstan, and was designed as the ultimate retreat from working life.

The intention behind the transparent architectural structure, tucked away in a sea of lofty fir trees, is to merge manmade industrial design with nature and 'give up some unnecessary conditions and things'.

You must be barking! The intention behind the transparent architectural structure, tucked away in a sea of lofty fir trees, is to merge manmade industrial design with nature and 'give up some unnecessary conditions and things'

The four-storey home is made from four metal poles, which supports each floor with a spiral staircase connecting each, and is encased in double-glazing glass walls.

At the heart of the building, which was built for a 38-year-old businessman last year and cost £240,000 to construct, is a colossal fir tree.

Architect Aibek Almasov, who spent five months constructing the home, said: 'The project aims to offer an alternative to bustling city life and stifling urban structures by fusing a protective house and a natural environment without creating a visual separation.

You'll be glade to live here: Architect Aibek Almasov said he wants to offer an 'alternative to bustling city life and stifling urban structures by fusing a protective house and a natural environment without creating a visual separation'

Why wood you? At the heart of the building, which was built for a 38-year-old businessman last year and cost £240,000 to construct, is a colossal fir tree

'The client wanted to build a home for two people and make it a place to relax with friends, mull over ideas and philosophise.

'It is a stunning building that we were all extremely proud to be involved in.'

Aibek, 22, works for A.Masow Design Studio with four other designers and they have since received several other requests from buyers who want a similar home.

And considering the average property price in the area costs more than £620,000, these idyllic retreats are a bargain not to be sniffed at.
