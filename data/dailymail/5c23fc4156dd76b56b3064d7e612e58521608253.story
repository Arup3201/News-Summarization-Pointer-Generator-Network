A dying man was left for nearly five hours in an ambulance in a hospital car park because NHS staff were too busy, an inquest heard yesterday.

Michael Bowen, 58, died of a seizure two hours after being finally admitted into the hospital’s strained accident and emergency department.

An inquest heard how the Welsh NHS hospital would 'frequently' keep patients in ambulances in the car park because of a shortage of beds.

His heartbroken mother Joan wept as she said: 'I just want to know why my son was kept in an ambulance for so long.

'He was a good son and a good person - I miss him hugely.'

The hearing was told former miner Mr Bowen was 'significantly ill' when his mother called 999 for help.

He was taken five miles to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, complaining of breathing difficulties and abdominal pain.

When he arrived at the hospital in the early hours of the morning, he was taken inside to be seen by a nurse.

But Mr Bowen was then returned to the waiting ambulance because there were no beds.The inquest heard how two other patients were also sat in ambulances at the time.

Nurse Caroline Gardener said: 'Of the three patients in ambulances I thought Mr Bowen was top priority. He needed clinically to be seen first.

'But I thought the safest place for him was to go back into the ambulance where he could be monitored.

'It is not uncommon for the department not to have any beds available a few times a week.

'I am professionally concerned about the situation, because it was a danger to anyone walking through the door - it puts everyone at A&E at risk.'

The inquest heard that in the early hours of January 16 the hospital was experiencing 'capacity issues'.

The emergency department had become 'bottle-necked' by the number of admissions during the night.

The Welsh NHS hospital would 'frequently' keep patients in ambulances in the car park because of a shortage of beds.

There were 23 patients in the A&E department - with 11 waiting for beds. Patients were left in corridors on trolleys.

Nurse sister Deborah Lewis who treated Mr Bowen told the hearing she arrived on her shift to see three ambulances outside A&E with patients inside.

Coroner Andrew Barkley asked her: 'Have you seen this before?' She replied: 'Yes, too often. It happens quite frequently now.'

Mr Bowen, of Bettws, Bridgend, South Wales, had been in the hospital for two hours collapsed with a sudden seizure. The inquest heard he was suffering from severe liver disease.

Nurses moved him into a resuscitation unit. But Mr Bowen, who weighed 25 stone, died of a thrombosis.

Police investigated the death of bachelor Mr Bowen, who lived with his parents, but found no criminal negligence.

An independent investigation by consultant Andrew Balham of neighbouring Wye Valley NHS Trust found a number of failures in his treatment.

His report said: 'After the initial diagnose the critical care team should have been notified.

'All these things would have been dealt with if the patient was in the emergency department itself.'

However, in his narrative verdict, Mr Barkley, found that ‘on the balance of probabilities’, Mr Bowen’s death was not caused by or contributed to by the delay in transferring him into A&E from the ambulance.
