Ever dreamed of receiving a kiss from Sienna Miller? Well, now you can thanks to Burberry's romantic and innovative new project.

Burberry and Google have teamed up to allow users to capture and send a kiss to anyone in the world using their phone or webcam.

The service was launched earlier this year but now Sienna expertly shows us how it's done in a sexy new campaign video with the help of fiance Tom Sturridge.

With love, Sienna: Miss Miller, who is the current face of Burberry along with fiance Tom Sturridge, demonstrates Burberry and Google's new kissing technology

So how does it work? Users should log onto the dedicated Burberry platform - Kisses.Burberry.com - pucker up and then kiss their phone screen. The savvy technology takes the lip contact from your kiss and transforms it into a digital kiss print.

It then seals a digital letter which can be sent to anyone, anywhere in the world via Google +, Facebook, email or Twitter.

You can even colour your kiss with your favourite 
lipstick shade (from Burberry's latest beauty collection, no doubt). 

Pucker up! You kiss your screen, it takes the lip contact from your real life kiss and transforms it into a digital kiss print which is then sent to your loved one

There it goes! Once sent, watch as your kiss is transported from wherever you are in the world, to wherever in the world your recipient is - through 3-D city skylines, using Google Earth technologies - eventually landing in their inbox

Once your kiss has been sent, you can 
watch it fly through the sky to your recipient through 3-D city skylines
using Google Earth 
technologies.

'Burberry 
Kisses began with the idea of giving technology a bit of heart and soul,
and using it to unite the Burberry family across the world - by telling
a story that makes the digital personal,' said Burberry chief creative 
officer Christopher Bailey.

'We're constantly thinking about how we translate the emotion of what we create and experience in the real world into the digital space, whether that's capturing the energy and excitement of a live gig, the hum and buzz of anticipation before a runway show, or just the feeling you get when you pull on your trench coat on a rainy morning.'

Burberry
recently unveiled it's 'With Love Christmas' campaign, which was the 
culmination of an entire year that celebrates all things romantic.

The
theme was first introduced in February with the Burberry Prorsum men's 
and womenswear AW collections, where a heart motif was prominent in 
the collection. Just ask famous fans, Harry Styles and Victoria Beckham
who championed the burgundy shirt with the playful heart print.

In
July, Sienna Miller and Tom brought the season's love story to life in the Burberry AW 
2013 ad campaign before featuring in the Burberry Kisses video.
