Charlotte Crosby's 3 Minute Belly Blitz

Charlotte Crosby went on an intense fitness regime after a series of unflattering pictures emerged of her on a beach in July, and she went from size 16 to a size 8 in just six months.

The Sunderland-born beauty has lost 2.5 stone and achieved admirable washboard abs.

Her new DVD features a combination of fat-burning three-minute workouts and exercises designed to help tone up the midsection - promising to burn 5lbs in just one week. The routine builds up every time you use the DVD working through 12 stages, and there's also a diet plan included.

Charlotte's first DVD topped the fitness DVD charts a day after her new weight-loss programme was released. It follows in the footsteps of co-star Vicky Pattison's best selling exercise DVD, 7 Day Slim last year.
