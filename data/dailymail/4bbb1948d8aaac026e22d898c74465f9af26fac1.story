They are classic symbols of a laid-back student lifestyle, but overdue library books have earned Britain’s universities £50 million in fines.

Top of the earners was Leeds University, which has raised more than £1.8 million in the past six years.

In second place, Manchester University collected almost £1.3 million, while the University of Wolverhampton came third with £1.25 million.

At the bottom of the table, Imperial College London collected £26,703.

With fines as little as 10p for each day overdue, the figures show students are returning thousands of books late each year.

And many are never returned at all, with more than 300,000 books unaccounted for across the country.

The university with the worst lost books record was Bucks New University, High Wycombe, followed by Oxford and then Kent.

The figures were revealed in Freedom of Information requests to Britain’s universities.

But some universities are getting tough. Library debts as low as  £5 will prevent students from graduating at Exeter University,  as will £20 of debts at Lancaster or  £25 at Glasgow.

And at Westminster, negligent students are banned from using  the library for as long as their  books have been overdue.
