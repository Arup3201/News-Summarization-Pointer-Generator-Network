Halliburton is buying rival oilfield services company Baker Hughes in a cash-and-stock deal worth $34.6 billion.

The deal comes just days after talks between the two had stalled and Halliburton prepared to go hostile with its takeover bid. 

By the end, though, it appeared that relations between the companies thawed and that Halliburton's acquisition of Baker Hughes was not hostile. 

'We envision a combined company capable of achieving opportunities that neither company would have realized as well - or as quickly- on its own,' Baker Hughes Chairman and CEO Martin Craighead said after the deal was announced. 

Shares of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes stocks surged after the takeover was announced on Sunday. Halliburton will become the biggest oil services company in the world

The combined energy company would generate slightly larger revenue than Schlumberger Ltd., currently the world's biggest oil services company.

Halliburton,  which was once led by former Vice President Dick Cheney, operates oil services contracts around the world. However, it may be best known by the public for its role in the Iraq War and its involvement with the Deep Water Horizon oil rig disaster, which spilled 210million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.  

Companies like Halliburton and Baker Hughes can be the first in the energy sector to the feel pressure from plunging prices, and both have seen their stock fall in recent months. Global oil prices have tumbled 31 percent over the past 5 months to levels not seen in four years.

The transaction is valued at $78.62 per Baker Hughes Inc. share, a 31 percent premium to its Friday closing price of $59.89. Baker Hughes shareholders will receive 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19.00 in cash for each share they own.

The companies put the deal's enterprise value at about $38 billion.

When the transaction is complete, Baker Hughes stockholders will own approximately 36 percent of the combined company.

On Friday it appeared that talks were falling apart, with Baker Hughes saying that Halliburton had refused to raise its first and only offer. The company did not say what that offer was.

Halliburton Chairman and CEO Dave Lesar said Monday that the combined company will realize annual cost savings of nearly $2 billion.

Halliburton plans to finance the cash portion of the acquisition through a combination of available cash and fully committed debt financing.

The boards of both Houston companies approved the deal unanimously and it's targeted to close in the second half of 2015. Shareholders and regulators must still sign off on the tie-up.

Halliburton said that it is willing to divest businesses that generate up to $7.5 billion in revenues, if required by regulators, but the company though believes that the divestitures required will be significantly less. Halliburton has also agreed to pay a termination fee of $3.5 billion if the transaction ends due to a failure to obtain the necessary antitrust approvals.

Baker Hughes's stock rose more than 15 percent in Monday premarket trading, while shares of Halliburton fell more than 3 percent.
