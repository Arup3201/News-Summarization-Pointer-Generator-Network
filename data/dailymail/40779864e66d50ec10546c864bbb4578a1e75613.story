An American student has been named the world's youngest competitive eater - despite weighing just 126lbs and studying to become a dietician.

Matt Stonie, 22, regularly consumes a staggering 15,000 calories per meal - six times more than the recommended daily allowance for men - at his home in San Jose, California.

He eats up to 15 per cent of his bodyweight while training for competitions, including colossal portions of hotdogs, fried asparagus and frozen yoghurt.

In high spirits: The 22-year-old student eats up to 15 per cent of his bodyweight while training for competitions

In recent months, he has broken world records by eating 24 gyros - a Greek kebab filled with meat, roasting vegetables and tzatziki - and 12lbs of fried asparagus in just 10 minutes.

But despite his incredible achievements, Mr Stonie weighs a tiny 126lbs and is studying to become a dietician, something he admits is 'fairly contradictory'.

The nutrition major is now the youngest competitor on the Major League Eating circuit after competing professionally for four years.

Mr Stonie, who is currently training for the world's biggest food challenge - Nathan's Hot Dog eating competition in Coney Island, New York - today described his hobby as 'hard work'.

'It's all about a strict diet and training regime to keep the weight off,' he said.

'When I'm competing, or even just training, I can eat nearly 10-15 per cent of my bodyweight in food and liquids, so I've had to tailor my normal diet to cope with that.

Competitive eaters usually undergo rigorous training in the weeks - or months - leading up to competitions.

This
 involves eating colossal amounts of food over a short period of time, 
as well as drinking large quantities of water to increase their stomach 
capacity.

Although widely popular in America, Canada and Japan, the 'sport' has been criticised for its potential health risks.

Some
 medics claim it can cause weight gain - leading to high cholesterol and 
blood pressure - while others argue it can cause stomach paralysis, 
indigestion and choking.

In October 2012, a 32-year-old man choked to death while competitively consuming live cockroaches in Florida.

Competitive eating has also been condemned for the message it sends to children as obesity levels soar in the U.S. and Europe.

'When I'm seriously training, I go to the gym about five times a week and have to skip meals with friends and family to stick to my schedule and keep my weight down.'

Mr Stonie said he often uses the Michael
 Phelps challenge to increase his stomach capacity in the weeks leading 
up to competitions.

The challenge involves consuming the Olympic swimmers' daily calories - a whopping 12,590 - in one sitting.

Despite the seemingly impossible task, he regularly finishes of all the food - including two trays of pasta, a family-size pizza and five-egg omelette - in just over 40 minutes.

Mr Stonie said his nutrition studies had helped him to balance out the side-effects of taking in so much sugar, salt and fat in such a short time, which include massive sugar crashes.

'The crashes can be really severe - like drinking too much coffee at night,' he said.

'Fortunately, sugar is usually easier to deal with digestion wise rather than fatty or high protein meals.

'I started to study nutrition to help understand how the body deals with that amount of food.

'It's fairly contradictory to be studying towards becoming a dietician, but has helped me a lot with staying healthy throughout all this eating.'

Since winning the first competition he 
entered in 2010 - a lobster roll eating challenge with a top prize of $600 - Mr Stonie has earned $46,00, ranking him as the second best in 
the world.

In the last four years, he has competed all over the United States, as well as travelling to Singapore and Indonesia, as he builds up a heated rivalry with the world number one, Joey 'Jaws' Chestnut.

Mr Stonie said he had first realised he 
had a talent for consuming huge portions of food at the age of 18, when 
he had managed to complete a 5lb burrito challenge in just 15 minutes.

Dedicated to the 'sport': Mr Stonie (pictured) today described his passion for competitive eating as 'hard work'

'I
 used to watch Man v Food, and think "I could whip that guy" so it 
sparked my interest and led me to enter my 1st eating contest - lobster 
roll eating,' he said.

'Amazingly, I won against a seasoned competitor, so I got addicted to everything - the competition, the adrenaline, the crowd

'I loved everything about it and, to an 18 year old kid, starting college, getting $600 for only 10 minutes of eating was unbelievable.'
