From the outside it looks like it could still light up a city but the Frank R Phillips power station in South Heights, Pittsburgh was living on borrowed time. The World War Two era relic was just weeks from demolition. Photographer Matthew Christopher thought it was important that he documented the buildings which form part of America's growing rust belt. 

When it was commissioned in 1943, it produced enough power for the whole of the city of Pittsburgh and cope with the demands of war production from the heavy industrial plants. 

The coal-fired plant was wound down in the 1990s as demand for heavy industry declined and attempts to reopen it failed. Eventually it was earmarked for demolition.

Inside however, the control room looks like something from a bygone era banks of analogue dials and switches, and a distinct lack of flat screens monitors 

Deeper inside the aged building, which was demolished in 2011, are the engineering stations where dozens of people had to closely monitor the power station's output

Writing on his blog, Christopher explains: 'After a few years of trying, a good friend of mine was able to arrange a tour of the Frank R. Phillips Power Station less than a year before it was demolished. While the plant was a lot more modern and was much less decayed than some I have been to, the sheer scale of the plant was amazing. 

'At over 11 stories, there was simply no way to see the whole plant in a day, but we did cover quite a bit of ground. The engineer who lead us through the plant knew every aspect of its operation and was nearly as interesting as the plant itself. It was an exhausting day in a string of long days out taking pictures, but it was still a disappointment when it ended and even moreso when the plant was demolished and the opportunity to return was gone forever.'

As well as power plants, Christopher, 36, has also shot empty churches, hotels, hospitals and prisons.

Christopher, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, revealed two of the sites he photographed - Westport Generating Station in Baltimore and Frank R. Phillips Power Station in South Heights - were demolished soon after.

He estimates that he has photographed more than a dozen power plants all featured in his soon to be released book Abandoned America: The Age of Consequences.

Christopher said: 'I do quite a bit of research to identify locations I'd like to photograph and I'm fortunate I have friends who have helped me out with connections or information.'

He said: 'It's important to me to work with people who manage these sites to present the places in a way that doesn't cause them any problems.

'They can also be quite dangerous so you have to be very careful. But they are also my favorite type of places to photograph.

'People seem fascinated by these sorts of places too.

'Most of us will never get to see what the inside of a power plant looks like yet we're dependent on them to produce the electricity that powers everything in our homes.'

The amazing images form part of photographer Matthew Christopher's Abandoned America series which documents the rusting hulks of the nation's industrial heritage 

According to Christopher, he wanted to capture the building which was completed in the early 1940s for posterity before it was eventually demolished

This is the Turbine Hall of the Westport Generating Station in Baltimore, Maryland which was demolished in 2008, providing a view into the industrial past

These turbines used to spin furiously generating power for thousands of people and businesses across the east coast of the United States 

But along with the demise of heavy industry in the area, the need for old fashioned, coal-fired power stations was lessened and they were eventually decommissioned

Matthew Christopher travelled across the east coast of the United States documenting the decline in the rust belt states as heavy industry moved on  

The giant machines look like they have been created to last for eternity, but much of the metal on display has already been recycled into new goods 

Christopher said he wanted to document the industrial past before it was demolished

Running a coal-fired power station was a massive logistical undertaking with large quantities of fuel needed every day from their own elevated railway 

The rusting hulk of this turbine marks as a stark reminder of the decline in America's industrial strength as heavy industry has moved to the far east 

These coal chutes fed the massive furnaces around the clock with a constant stream of railway carriages providing fuel for the insatiable beast

Less than half-a-century later it was doomed with the collapse of heavy industry and concerns over coal power
