A man in a Florida news station's helicopter found a missing ten-year-old boy on Monday - and was able to tip off law enforcement on where to find him in the woods, local media reported.

The boy is a Saturn Elementary School student and vanished near lunch, Brevard County school officials told WKMG.

The CBS affiliate reported that one of its own photojournalists, David Sprung, was on the Sky 6 helicopter and discovered the boy's ground position.

Found: The missing 10-year-old was seen by a WKMG helicopter on Monday after he went missing from his elementary school 

Making a break for it: The boy is a Saturn Elementary School student and has said he was 'running away from school' 

'Normally people don't like Mondays... I now like Mondays,' Sprung told WKMG. 'This has been the absolute best day of my life since I've been doing news.'

Indeed, the Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey Office said in a Monday release 'This afternoon, Deputies responded to Saturn Elementary School after School Administrators reported the child had left the campus. The administrators advised the child has existing medical conditions and was not in possession of required medications.

'Aviation Units, K9 Units, and Agents from the Brevard County Sheriff's Office immediately responded to assist in the search. During the efforts, Media Helicopters also responded to the area and assisted in trying to help locate the missing child.

'Dave Sprung, a media helicopter pilot with WKMG Orlando subsequently spotted the child deep in the woods in the area of the school and alerted the Sheriff's Aviation Unit.'

The boy later told WKMG while in a stretcher after deputies collected him that he had been 'running away from school.'

'Upon recovery the child was medically evaluated by Brevard County Fire Rescue and determined to be fatigued, but otherwise unharmed,' Ivey said in the release. 'Deputies safely assisted the child out of the woods where he was united with his family.'

Brevard County Sheriff's Office spokesman Cpl. David Jacobs told Daily Mail Online the sheriff's office received a call about the boy at 12:19pm. Deputies were dispatched one minute later, with the first deputy arriving at 12:23pm, Jacobs said.

The news helicopter observed the boy at 1:40pm, and deputies got to his location 17 minutes later, Jacobs said.

The boy was 200 yards into the woods, and it took deputies 26 minutes to get out of the woods due to heavy brush, Jacobs told Daily Mail Online.

Brevard Public Schools spokeswoman Michelle Irwin told Florida Today 'A lunchtime supervision plan is in place so students are monitored consistently,' and mentioned a student of conduct and check-out procedures.

Irwin told Daily Mail Online she was deferring to the BCSO report, and said 'We were advised that the student left campus at lunch (approximately 12:30). The teacher on duty saw him leave and immediately contacted school administrators. They in turn contacted BCSO and the family.'
