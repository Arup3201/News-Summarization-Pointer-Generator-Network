Mbia is out of contract at QPR and would be an attractive free signing after his performances in La Liga showed a stark improvement on his debut season displays in the Premier League.

The former Marseille man featured 27 times last season at Sevilla as the Spanish outfit won the Europa League.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez is interested in Mbia, who can also play in defence, as Gareth Barry is deliberating over their contract offer with West Ham interested in the 33-year-old free agent too. 

Mbia is currently on international duty with Cameroon in the World Cup and started for the African nation in their 1-0 Group A defeat to Mexico on Saturday.

Cameroon face Croatia on Thursday in Manaus' Arena Amazonia.
