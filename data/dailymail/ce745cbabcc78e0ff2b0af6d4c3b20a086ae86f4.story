The parents of a boy with a genetic defect that causes severe seizures are suing the state of Arizona to be able to give their son medicinal cannabis oil without the risk of being arrested.

Zander Welton, 5, of Maricopa County, was born with cortical dysplasia, which is a condition that disrupts cellular patterns in the brain and is often the cause of epilepsy.

Zander, who cannot speak, was suffering seizures daily before his parents started giving him cannabis oil.

Genetic defect: Zander Welton, 5, was born with cortical dysplasia, a condition that disrupts cellular patterns in the brain and is often the cause of epilepsy

Deadly: The defect causes Zander to have daily seizures of up to 10 minutes that are so severe he turns blue and stops breathing

Help: Zander's parents are suing Arizona state to get the right to give their son the cannabis oil which they say makes his seizures almost disappear

Zander’s mother, Jennifer Welton, said they turned to medicinal marijuana as a last resort, according to ABC News.

Prior
to the treatment, the 5-year-old had received many other kinds of 
medication and had undergone two brain surgeries in an effort to 
alleviate the severity of his seizures.

Doctors had removed part of his hippocampus and his left temporal lobe, but his seizures persisted. 

According
to the Weltons, Zander's doctor said their final option to alleviate 
his seizures was to remove the left hemisphere of his brain, which could
have left him paralyzed or in a vegetative state.

So they decided to try the cannabis oil option first. 

Zander
was put on cannabidiol oil, or CBD, in September after he qualified for
a medical marijuana card. There are approximately 40 minors in Arizona 
who qualify for a medical marijuana card.

Surgery: The 5-year-old has had two brain surgeries in an effort to alleviate the severity of his seizures

According to court documents, the Weltons noticed an improvement in Zander's symptoms.

He no longer had severe seizures daily that would last up to 10 minutes and would cause him to stop breathing and turn blue.

Instead,
in the seven weeks since Zander had been taking medicinal marijuana, 
Welton said he had only two seizures and each only lasted a few minutes,
and he didn't stop breathing.

In
addition, Zander has been able to communicate more and has started to 
shake his head signifying when he doesn't like something.

‘One
of the things I said at the beginning before we started ... I just 
wanted to know my son a little bit,’ said Welton of Zander's personality
changes.

‘We're finally getting to see that. He's finally started to come through,’ she told ABC News.

Severe condition: Zander was born with cortical dysplasia. He can't speak or use his hands and he suffers from daily seizures in which he almost dies

Desperate: Zander's mother, Jennifer Welton, right, said they turned to medicinal marijuana as a last resort

Although Arizona allows marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes, some state officials, including the attorney for Maricopa County and the head of the Arizona Department of Health Services, have said that products with resin extracted from marijuana, such as the oil originally used to treat Zander, are actually classified as an illegal narcotic according to the state's criminal code.

Welton said she did not want to do anything that could be construed as being illegal and stopped giving Zander the CBD.

Zander is now currently taking medicinal marijuana in dried plant form, but Welton said it wasn't ideal and hard to effectively administer to Zander.

She tries to hide it in his porridge and other meals but it does not always work.

‘He does sometimes find it and then will spit out a piece,’ said Welton. ‘With the oil extract, it's like the other mediations. You just give him a syringe, boom, you're done.’ 

The lawsuit names the defendants as Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, Maricopa County Attorney William Montgomery, the Arizona Department of Health Services, and the director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, William Humble.

Although treating cortical dysplasia with CBD has not been fully studied in humans, there have been studies with animals, according to ABC News.

Dr. Steven Wolf, director of pediatric epilepsy at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, said that parents should be wary of using CBD to treat epilepsy pending the results of studies currently being conducted.

Wolf said that doctors don't yet know if children would build up a quick tolerance to CBD or if it would ultimately prove ineffective in treating seizures.

‘I can say, if this was my kid and if there was a possibility it would work, I would certainly want to know,’ said Wolf. ‘This is interesting, but this needs investigation.’
