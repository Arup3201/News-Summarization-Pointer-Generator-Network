Aravindan Balakrishnan pictured today appearing at Southwark Crown Court to face 25 charges which include rape and indecent assault

A Maoist cult leader accused of sexually abusing three of his female followers for more than three decades has appeared in court today.

Aravindan Balakrishnan, 74, faces four counts of rape and 19 charges of indecent assault against the three women.

He is also accused of one count of cruelty to a person under 16 years and one count of false imprisonment. All the charges relate to the period between January 1980 and October 2013.

Bespectacled Balakrishnan appeared at Southwark Crown Court sporting a receding grey mullet, and dressed in a blue coat and grey trousers and spoke only to confirm his identity.

During the brief hearing, Judge Anthony Leonard set a provisional trial date of July 20.

Known as 'Comrade Bala', Balakrishnan  was arrested in November 2013 after allegations emerged he had abused three women for more than 30 years at a house in Brixton.

His wife Chanda Pattni, 67, was also arrested but released without charge in September after 10 months on bail.

It was claimed a 69-year-old woman from Malaysia, a 57-year-old from Ireland and a 30-year-old Briton had been abused after joining Balakrishnan's extreme left wing cult.

Police raided the Brixton property after one of the women reported her alleged ordeal to a charity.

Tony Connell, prosecuting, said a plea and case management hearing would be held on March 4.

He said: 'We have prepared 200 pages of witness statement and 1000 pages of evidence from the victims.

'It is likely there will be four contentious witnesses. These include the three victims, two who have undergone prolonged sexual abuse and one victim mentioned in count one and two of the indictment, who will face cross examination.

'Thousands and thousands of pages of documents were found in his house which takes time to go through. Any trial will last at least 5 weeks.'

Adam Wiseman, defending, said this 25 count indictment needed a 'complex, detailed investigation'.

At a previous hearing on December 17 Balakrishnan was remanded on bail on condition that he continues to live at his address in Edmonton, north London, that he does not apply for any international travel documents or that he contact the three victims or two female witnesses.

Mr Wiseman said: 'He has been on bail throughout and has complied with bail conditions.'

Judge Leonard told Balakrishnan: 'You will return to court on March 4. 

'I have extended your bail until that point.'

The Brixton flat where the charges of rape and indecent assault were alleged to have taken place

A provisional trial date for Balakrishnan to faces four counts of rape and 19 charges of indecent assault, as well as one count of cruelty to a person under 16 years and one count of false imprisonment, has been set for July 20

Described as a 'guru', Balakrishnan set up a communist squat, the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre, in Brixton in 1976 where the couple ran their group, the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse Tung Thought, holding lectures and film evenings.

He had been kicked out of the Communist Party's national executive after his faction 'attempted to put themselves above the discipline of the party'. 

After raiding the house, police removed 55 bags of evidence and 12,500 exhibits, but admitted the 'complexity' of the case meant it would take a long time to investigate.
