There is a new chef in town who plans to give Heston Blumenthal a run for his money.

The cooking-maestro, named Watson, has been impressing crowds in Zurich with its broccoli mango soup, chocolate burritos and Belgian bacon cake.

But Watson isn't any ordinary chef.

It is, in fact, a supercomputer who originally rose to fame after beating quiz show champion Ken Jennings at Jeopardy.

Watson, created by IBM, uses a database of tried-and-tested recipes from around the world.

It then combines this with information about which flavours are present in ingredients, and uses something called 'hedonic perception theory' to model how humans react to its recipes.

Chefs begin by inputting a main ingredient, such as apple for instance, as well as a regional cuisine such as Eastern Europe.

Watson then flips through a nearly endless database of recipes.

The offbeat list of ingredients Watson spits out may not always sound delicious - suggesting apples has coaxed Watson to produce the offbeat garlicky, pork loin-laced Baltic Apple Pie.

But it is the taste that matters.

Supercomputer, super chef: IBM has put its famous Jeopardy champ supercomputer Watson to use whipping up cutting edge recipes for its food truck tour

The cooking-maestro, named Watson, has been impressing crowds in Zurich with its broccoli soup with mango, chocolate burritos (pictured) and Belgian bacon cake

Pork belly apple pie, anyone? Chefs input a main ingredient and Watson pumps out a list of other ingredients that sound weird, but that science states taste delicious when put together

At a recent demonstration in Zurich, 
Watson began by cooking a beefsteak tomato taco with a splash of cider 
vinegar, some vanilla and a few pieces of lemon peel.

It
 then created a broccoli soup with mango chunks, orange juice and cider.
 This was followed by a bottle of Bengal butternut barbecue sauce on the
 side and a Middle Eastern chickpea ragout.

Dessert came in the form of a green-tea pudding with whiskey, tapioca and cardamom.

'The
 soup sounds awful', Michel Roux Junior, a two Michelin star chef told 
James Dean at the Times. 'But my palate tells me the green-tea pudding 
would work.'

European tastes: The Watson food truck had its debut at a Las Vegas technology show in March. The truck (pictured) is now cooking up its recipes at IBM's research headquarters in Zurich

As well as the billions of 
combinations Watson can come up with, having the chefs there to decide 
how to use the ingredients makes for even more possibilities.

'Two different chefs can get the same 
list of ingredients and come up with completely different dishes,' James
 Briscione, one of the chefs working with Watson and IBM, told The Salt.

The chef isn't afraid of losing his job to the supercomputer, though.

He
 told The Salt that sometimes a list of ingredients will have all the 
best flavours but none of the all-important aspect of a great dish, 
texture.

'You can end up with a list of ingredients, and none of them has an element of crispiness,' he said.

IBM
 is showing off Watson's diverse skill sets as position themselves to 
make the Sueprcomputer's benefits available to businesses and 
individuals.

The company said its new 
Manhattan-based business unit devoted soley to Watson will be dedicated 
to the development and commercialisation of the project that first 
gained fame by defeating a pair of ‘Jeopardy!’ champions, including 
74-time winner Jennings, in 2011.

In
 the years since Watson's TV appearance, IBM has been developing the 
supercomputer for more practical purposes and changed it to a 
cloud-based service.

Its
 massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room, 
but Watson is now the size of three stacked pizza boxes, according to 
BetaNews.

IBM claims Watson is unique because it it's programmed like traditional computers, but uses artificial intelligence to learn from its past experiences and factor this information into its future operations.

‘IBM has transformed Watson from a 
quiz-show winner, into a commercial cognitive computing breakthrough 
that is helping businesses engage customers, healthcare organisations 
personalise patient care, and entrepreneurs build businesses,’ said 
Michael Rhodin, who heads the Watson Group.

IBM
 chief executive Ginni Rometty said that Watson is built for a world 
where big data is transforming every industry and every profession.

‘Watson
 does more than find the needle in the haystack,’ Rometty said in 
remarks released ahead of the Watston Group's unveiling. ‘It understands
 the haystack. It understands context.’

More practical than Jeopardy: IBM has been thinking big when it comes to Watson and since its 2011 Jeopardy win against champs including Ken Jennings, the firm has created a Manhattan-based arm of the company specifically geared toward putting the supercomputer to use for businesses and consumers
