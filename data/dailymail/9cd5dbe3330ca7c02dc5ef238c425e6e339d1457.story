A young woman who plunged a nine-inch kitchen knife into a fellow partygoer in a row over alcohol, has been jailed for 10 years. 

Samantha Houlgrave, 20, stabbed Samuel Madden because he wanted to take unopened drinks he had brought  to her house party home with him.

He suffered damaged to his kidneys and liver and was told if the wound was half an inch either way he would be dead.

Mr Madden had to undergo extensive surgery to make sure he was not suffering internal damage.

Detective Constable Rob Sledge said Mr Madden had been left with both physical and mental scars as a result of the attack, which happened at Houlgrave's home in Blackburn, Lancashire.

He said: 'They had both been drinking at Houlgrave's house.. It was a house party gone wrong.

'Mr Madden decided to leave and he wanted to take the drinks he had paid for with him. Houlgrave objected.

'She said she picked the knife up off the grass outside the house and she forgot she had it in her hand. She said she went to push Mr Madden away and that is when she stabbed him.'

Mr Madden needed surgery to repair the 'nicks' in his organs. 

DC Sledge added: 'He will have life-long scarring and has had to have a lot of extensive surgical intervention.

'Mr Madden has been really lucky because the surgeon said if the knife had gone in half an inch either side of where it did, he would be dead.'

A jury convicted Houlgrave of inflicting grievous bodily harm following a five-day trial at Preston Crown Court.

Houlgrave was hauled back before the court moments after being jailed after lighting a cigarette in the cells

She was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, plus a further three on an extended licence.

However the defendant was again hauled before another judge after she lit a cigarette in a cell, causing the fire alarms to sound and the building to be evacuated.

 Judge Anthony Russell QC said: 'It needs to be understood that it could well be a contempt of court either to bring items to court which should not be brought and certainly, to use them in a way which results in disrupting proceedings.'

James Heyworth, representing Houlgrave, said she apologised for the inconvenience.
