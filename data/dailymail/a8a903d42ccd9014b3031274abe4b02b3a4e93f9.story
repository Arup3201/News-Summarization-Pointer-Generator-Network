The finger of blame was pointed squarely at the Health and Safety Executive last night over the leaking of details of immigration raids.

Whitehall sources said a mole at the safety watchdog had potentially sabotaged a meticulous operation against foreigners who were working illegally in Britain.

They suggested the HSE had passed documents to a left-wing protest group that named the targets in a crackdown against small businesses suspected of illicitly employing migrants.

Last night the watchdog declined to comment on the leaks, while insiders insisted there was ‘no indication that we are being pointed at’.

The agency is one of around six organisations consulted ahead of any immigration raids.

The Home Office said swoops it had planned as part of a two-week blitz on workplaces were jeopardised after details were passed to the Anti Raids Network, which warned firms to expect raids.

Despite the leaks, eight Indian nationals were arrested yesterday in an operation at a sandwich shop in Walsall, West Midlands. 

A Home Office spokesman said the group – seven women and a man – had committed visa offences, but insiders fear the leak could have allowed more suspects to evade capture.

‘It’s entirely possible a boss who uses illegal labour has told someone not to turn up for work because they’ve been given the heads-up that immigration officials will be pulling up in the driveway,’ said one.

The Anti Raids Network said it had seen 225 pieces of operational intelligence in what it described as the biggest Home Office leak in recent years.

The protest group said the leak was justified because the swoops ‘demonised migrant labour’ and were ‘unfair’.

However, Home Office officials strenuously denied engaging in racial profiling and insisted the raids were ‘intelligence-led’.
