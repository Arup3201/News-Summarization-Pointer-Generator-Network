There were no litter boxes and the animals were found living in dank, cramped cages with barely enough room to lay down, according to the New Rochelle Humane Society.

Some of the cats had been kept in the Greenburgh home for years, the Humane Society said. The house is in foreclosure.

'When we first took in all the cats, every cat was absolutely terrified. They were at the back of the cage really overwhelmed, afraid to even move to come to use the litter box or eat,' shelter manager Dana Rocco told 1010 WINS. 'We’re finding everyday there’s another cat at the front of the cage, they’re starting to relax. These are gorgeous cats.'

Some of the cats needed medical attention, while other are recovering from the awful conditions that were living in.

The organization is now trying to find homes for the felines.

'At this point we need homes for these or for our other cats to make room to absorb these cats in,' Rocco said. 'We have cats that have filled up every cage in the room and then we have a room that we normally use for volunteers and orientations that’s filled with cages to accommodate all of these cats.'
