An anti-bloodsport campaigner and councillor has provoked fury by claiming that the suicide of a former soldier and game hunter was the ‘best use of a gun I can think of’.

Thomas Woodward is facing calls to quit over the ‘outrageous’ remarks, which were posted on the Hunt Saboteurs Association’s Facebook page.

The 48-year-old – a Liberal councillor on Ryedale District and Pickering Town councils in North Yorkshire – made the comments after reading reports about the death of Allan Ellis.

Thomas Woodward is facing calls to quit by claiming that the suicide of former soldier and game hunter, Alan Ellis, above, was the ‘best use of a gun I can think of’

Mr Ellis, 50, a former Scots Guard from Bacup, Lancashire, shot himself in August after learning he was to be sued over a £40,000 debt. Mr Woodward wrote: ‘We would all rather live in a world where no one kills for fun. However, if you choose to own a gun and kill for pleasure, then it’s best you kill yourself.’

Richard Ali, of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said: ‘Mocking the suicide of anyone is absolutely unacceptable. Going further and stating that lawful gun owners should “kill themselves” is despicable behaviour. This man is not fit to hold a public office.’

Tim Bonner, of the Countryside Alliance, called the remarks ‘outrageous’ and added: ‘Mr Woodward should consider his position and those in authority in his party and council should consider disciplinary action.’

Mr Woodward, a builder who also runs a B&B with his wife Debbie at their Pickering home, said he did not need to apologise because ‘I did not say I was glad he killed himself’.

He added the only risk to his position as a councillor was if he was voted off in an election.

However, if you choose to own a gun and kill for pleasure, then it’s best you kill yourself.’

‘I don’t agree with guns,’ he said. ‘People buy guns to kill things. If someone is going to buy a gun then the best reason for doing so is to kill themselves.

‘I disagree with killing anything. If disagreement with killing things means I upset shooting enthusiasts, then so be it.’

The Liberal Party, a group of councillors who have refused to join the Liberal Democrats, said that it could not comment in case there was an investigation.

Ryedale Council leader Linda Cowling said there had been numerous complaints that would trigger an investigation.

Mr Ellis’s widow Heather declined to comment.
