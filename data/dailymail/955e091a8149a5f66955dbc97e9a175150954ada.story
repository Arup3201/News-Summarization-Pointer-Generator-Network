Nasa's 
Kepler space telescope has discovered the three smallest planets yet detected 
orbiting a star beyond our Sun - one of which is as small as Mars.

The planets orbit a single star, called 
KOI-961, and are between three-quarters and half the size of Earth. The star itself is a tiny, cool red dwarf - leading Nasa to comment, 'Honey, I shrunk the planetary system.'All
three planets are thought to be rocky like Earth. Of the more than 700 planets 
confirmed to orbit other stars, called exoplanets, only a handful are 
known to be rocky.

The three planets are very close to their star, taking less than two days to orbit around it. The KOI-961 star is a red dwarf with a diameter one-sixth that of our Sun, making it just 70 percent bigger than Jupiter

'Astronomers
are just beginning to confirm the thousands of planet candidates 
uncovered by Kepler so far,' said Doug Hudgins, Kepler program scientist
at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

'Finding one as small as Mars is 
amazing, and hints that there may be a bounty of rocky planets all 
around us.'

Kepler searches for planets by continuously monitoring more than 150,000 stars, looking for telltale dips in their brightness caused by crossing, or transiting, planets.

Red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets

Using data from 
NASA’s Kepler Mission, San Diego State University astronomers
announced the discovery of two new solar systems where planets orbit two
stars - like the fictional planet Tatooine in Star Wars (pictured).

This work establishes that such 'two sun' planets
are not rare exceptions, but are in fact common with many millions existing in
our Galaxy.

Both systems reside in the constellation Cygnus, with Kepler-34 at
4,900 light-years from Earth, and Kepler-35 at 5,400 light-years, making these
among the most distant planets discovered.

The latest discovery comes from a team led by astronomers at the California Institute of Technology.

The team used data publicly released by the Kepler mission, along with follow-up observations from the Palomar Observatory, near San Diego, and the W.M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii.

Their measurements dramatically revised the sizes of the planets from what was originally estimated, revealing their small nature.The three planets are very close to their star, taking less than two days to orbit around it. The KOI-961 star is a red dwarf with a diameter one-sixth that of our Sun, making it just 70 percent bigger than Jupiter.'This is the tiniest solar system found so far,' said John Johnson, the principal investigator of the research from NASA’s Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

'It’s actually more similar to Jupiter and its moons in scale than any other planetary system. The discovery is further proof of the diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy.'Red dwarfs are the most common kind of star in our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery of three rocky planets around one red dwarf suggests that the galaxy could be teeming with similar rocky planets.'These types of systems could be ubiquitous in the universe,' said Phil Muirhead, lead author of the new study from Caltech. 'This is a really exciting time for planet hunters.'
