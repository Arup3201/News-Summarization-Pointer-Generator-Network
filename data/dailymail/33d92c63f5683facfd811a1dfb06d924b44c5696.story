Crystal Palace are exploring an audacious move to bring Ashley Cole to Selhurst Park on loan next month.

Palace manager Neil Warnock has identified a new left back as a top priority when the transfer window reopens in January.

Sportsmail can reveal Palace tried to land Cole ahead of the start of the season, prior to Tony Pulis’ unexpected departure.

And Palace are ready to revive their interest in the former England star who won 107 caps.

Cole’s position at Roma is unclear after being dropped from the starting line-up for the last five matches.

Cole’s struggles in Rome have reignited Palace’s interest but there are numerous hurdles to overcome before any move materialises - namely persuading Roma into a deal and the issue of wages.

Inclusive of bonuses, Cole earns up to £80,000 per week in Italy, while Palace’s wage ceiling is about £40,000 per week.

If Palace strike a deal, Cole would be making a romantic return to Selhurst Park.

The full-back spent a hugely successful loan spell at Palace in 2000, making 14 appearances for the club, prior to making his first-team breakthrough at Arsenal.

Palace fans still hold fond memories of Cole; and the former Chelsea man intimated - in a 2010 interview - that he would like to return to Palace one day.
