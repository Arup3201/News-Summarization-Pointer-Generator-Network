Megan Hoffner, pictured, claims she has been left £60,000 in debt, stands on the brink of losing her home and is embroiled in a legal fight

Millionaire businessmen Barrie and Tony Drewitt-Barlow present themselves as the poster boys of British surrogate parenting. 

But for one surrogate the decision to work with their British Surrogacy Centre (BSC) has proved to be disastrous.

The Drewitt-Barlows were the first gay couple named on a surrogate baby’s birth certificate and went on to have four more children, set up their surrogacy agency and star in reality show The Parent Makers.

But 5,000 miles away in San Diego, Megan Hoffner claims she has been left £60,000 in debt, stands on the brink of losing her home and is embroiled in a legal fight which has taken her to the edge of financial ruin. 

It is a complicated tale mired in claim and counter-claim from which no one emerges unscathed.

‘This whole process has been a disaster,’ she says. 

‘The low point for me was going into hospital for an emergency Caesarean section and waking up to find nobody would tell me if the twins I was carrying were alive or dead. I still have nightmares and anxiety attacks to this day.’

Megan, a 35-year-old mother of two, had successfully been a surrogate to twin girls for a Spanish family when, at the end of 2013, she decided to become a surrogate again.

She said: ‘I wanted to bring the joy of children to a family who might not otherwise experience that happiness. You get paid to be a surrogate, but this was never about making money.’ 

She added: ‘The British Surrogacy Centre leapt out at me. Barrie and Tony sounded like remarkable men. I got in touch with their local office in LA. I thought I was in for another magical journey. Instead it turned into the worst experience of my life.’

At first, Megan says, all went well. She signed a 24-page surrogacy agreement on November 21 2013 in which she agreed to bear a child (or multiple children) for Marco Aurelio Lucas and Roberto De Souza Silva. Megan is coldly referred to as ‘Carrier’ throughout.

The document says Megan will be paid £22,500 for one child – with childcare, lost wages, medical bills and ‘extra baby’ clauses built in – and an extra £5,000 for twins.

She also agrees to give up all parental rights to the children. The document says Megan will be tested for sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. 

She agrees not to smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs and the document coldly discusses what will happen if the child is born with life-threatening illness: ‘The Carrier shall have no input. The decision to utilize life-sustaining treatment…for the child shall be made by the Intended Parents.’

Megan, who works as a personal assistant for her father, a legal adviser for US Army veterans, says there were money problems from the start. 

‘At my first appointment they told me I was carrying twins. I was very sick so the doctor ordered me to take total bed rest. I couldn’t work. The bills started piling up.’

She claims the BSC failed to provide a translator, making it difficult for her to correspond with the Portuguese-speaking ‘intended parents’ in Brazil, adding: ‘I tried to do everything through the BSC, but they were grossly incompetent.’

Megan explained: ‘I kept submitting bills for expenses and the payments would be late. The BSC told me there were issues in Brazil and that because surrogacy was illegal in Brazil they’d had their bank account flagged up. I emailed Barrie Drewitt-Barlow at the end of last year, begging him to help to get my bills paid. In return he sent me emails full of abuse.’

Tony and Barrie Drewitt-Barlow have featured in a number of television shows, including Channel 4's My Weird And Wonderful Family and The Drewitt-Barlow's on Sky 192 

In one email Drewitt-Barlow, who lives in a sprawling Essex mansion, purportedly wrote: ‘I advised your Ips (Intended Parents) NOT to pay you anything at all because you are a crazy bitch who deserves to be locked up! Your Ips will not be paying you one more penny! I am so happy that they ran from you!’

Another says: ‘U should be ashamed of urself you utterly selfish cow! You are just trailer trash woman and I want nothing more to do with u! I will dig up all ur dirt including all the lawyers u p****d off on this case! You will not get one more penny, let’s face it ur contract will not stand up in any court in Brazil! Lol.’

Barrie Drewitt-Barlow last night claimed the emails shown to The Mail on Sunday by Megan had been doctored – something she vehemently denies. 

But she admits she’s made mistakes, including an angry email exchange with the Brazilians. ‘I sent some hateful emails to the Brazilian couple which I deeply regret. 

'I asked them if they really wanted these babies. They interpreted that as me threatening to abort the twins. I would never do that. 

'But I told them, if they didn’t want these children, I would have to place them up for adoption.’

Megan says she bears no ill-will towards the Brazilians, who moved to San Diego for the birth. They take a less charitable view of Megan, saying she was unreliable and unsuitable to be a surrogate.

But there is one thing that they all agree upon – the BSC did a poor job, a point made by their lawyer in court documents. 

Megan went into labour on 30 August last year: ‘I was doubled over in pain and rushed to the nearest hospital. I was heavily sedated. When I woke up the babies were gone and nobody would tell me if they were alive or dead as I had signed over my rights.’ 

Megan never saw the twins and was forced to go to court to try to get her outstanding bills paid. A Californian judge ordered £16,000 to be placed in a bond for her, which she claims the Brazilians failed to pay – choosing instead to leave the country.

Megan went on to say: ‘I blame BSC for all the problems. The Brazilians didn’t realise that the costs could escalate as they did.’

Last night Reece Statham, vice-president of the BSC, said: 'The majority of the money Megan claims is owed is medical fees incurred because she insisted on using a hospital not covered by her medical insurance. She was advised of this but refused to change.’ 

Megan claims that she used an ineligible hospital because she needed an emergency delivery.

Curiously, the BSC denies having any responsibility for administering the contract or even creating it, saying it was negotiated through both sides’ legal representatives.

Barrie Drewitt-Barlow told The Mail on Sunday that Megan had been extremely difficult to deal with and that her lifestyle meant she was not suitable as a surrogate.

‘She actually is as mad as a hatter,’ he said. Which rather begs the question – why was she chosen to be a surrogate in the first place?
