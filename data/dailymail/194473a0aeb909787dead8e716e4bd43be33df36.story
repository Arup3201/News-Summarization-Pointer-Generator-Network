Allegations: X-Men director Bryan Singer has been accused of sexually abusing an underage boy in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Hawaii

Just a month before his next film X-Men: Days of Future Past is set to release, director Bryan Singer has been accused of child molestation.

According to documents filed in Hawaii, 31-year-old Michael Egan claims Singer used his power in the entertainment industry to sexually exploit him when he was an underage teen actor striking it out in Los Angeles.

Now Egan is suing the director, for $300,000 for the 'catastrophic psychological and emotional injuries' he says he suffered, the documents filed Wednesday explain.

Representing Egan is attorney Jeff Herman, who plans on filing more sex abuse cases against film industry execs soon.

'Hollywood has a problem with the sexual exploitation of children. This is the first of many cases I will be filing to give these victims a voice and to expose the issue,' Mr Herman said in a press release.

In the suit, Egan claims the abuse started when he  was 14 or 15 and moved to Los Angeles with his family to start his acting career.

It was in LA that he was introduced to another Hollywood powerplayer, Marc Collins-Rector and his lover Chad Shackley, he claims. Egan was invited to one of Collins-Rector's 'notorious' parties held at his home, dubbed the M&C Estate in Encino, California.

According to the suit, the parties were well-known in Hollywood and attended by investors in Collin-Rector's company who lured young boys as part of a 'sordid sex ring'. Collins-Rector eventually faced justice himself, admitting in court in 2004 that he lured five minors across state lines for sexual purposes.

While these parties allegedly 'featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys', Egan maintains he 'never freely' consented to the advances.

It was two or three months after Collins-Rector began allegedly abusing Egan that he was introduced to Singer at one of the parties.

Egan was in the pool when Collins-Rector approached him and ordered him out to hug Singer.

Egan was nude, as per the rules of the house pool, so when he hugged Singer the director allegedly 'grabbed his bare buttocks'.

Egan claims the three then went to a jacuzzi where he was ordered to sit on Collins-Rector's lap before being passed off to Singer.

Promises: Singer has been directing X-men movies since 2000. He allegedly promised the then 17-year-old victim a role in one of the movies back in 1999. Above, a poster for Singer's latest film, due out next month

Egan claims Singer brought him an alcoholic beverage, even though he was under age, and then promised him a part in one of the upcoming movies he was directing.

He spoke about the people at the party, saying 'this group' controls Hollywood.

According to the lawsuit, Singer told Egan he was 'sexy' and went on to masturbate the underage boy and perform oral sex on him. The director then told Egan to do the same to him, but the then-minor says he resisted.

That allegedly caused Singer to push the boy's head under water. When he finally got up for air, Singer again demanded he perform oral sex and when he refused for the second time, Singer took him out of the pool and forcibly sodomized him, Egan says.

The suit also refrences two trips Egan went on with Singer to Hawaii when he was 17 years old.

Egan stayed at Paul Mitchell's resort in Kailua, Hawaii where he says Singer provided on multiple occasions cocaine,  xanax, rohypnol, as well as other drugs and alcohol.

Scene of the crime? Egan was allegedly taken on two trips to Hawaii with Singer where they stayed at the Paul Mitchell resort, entrance pictured above. However, those claims are now in question

He even promised him a part in an X-Men movie he was directing.

Singer first started directing the comic book adaptations in 2000. In 1999, when the Hawaii trips happened, the director would have been around 33 years old.

Egan and his lawyer are scheduled to hold a press conference about the new lawsuit Thursday in Los Angeles.

They've filed in Hawaii, however, since the statue of limitations to file a suit is longer there and would have expired next week.

In response, Marty Singer, a lawyer for the director, said 'it is obvious that this case was filed in an attempt to get publicity,' ahead of the film's release.

'The claims made against Bryan Singer are completely without merit. We are very confident that Bryan will be vindicated in this absurd and defamatory lawsuit.'
