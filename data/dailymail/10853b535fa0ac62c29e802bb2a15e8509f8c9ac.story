It was in 1998 that a World Cup quarter-final defeat by Croatia began a round of soul-searching in German football.

No, scratch that. It was in 2000, after being eliminated at the group stage in the European Championship; or maybe it was four years later, when the same thing happened.

That was when Jurgen Klinsmann and Joachim Low implemented the reform of German football, from the roots up.

Yes, but what about 2009 when the Under 21 team won the European Championship? Surely, that was the key to it all?

So, how about none of it, or all of it, but in evolutionary stages? How about instead of looking for one Eureka moment that transformed German football - a flash of genius, a bright idea to be copied by England from the wilderness - we acknowledge that what sets them apart is that they are in a constant state of self-evaluation, while never allowing the free pass of treating a World Cup as a dry run.

Rebuilding?: The Germans, who dominated Brazil 7-1 in their World Cup semi-final, are ever-evolving

For in the 16 years from 1998 to here, while German football has searched for its way forward, the Nationalmannschaft has also reached two World Cup finals (2002 and 2014), two World Cup semi-finals (2006 and 2010), a European Championship final (2008) and a European Championship semi-final (2012).

England, who preciously imagine themselves to be in the same rebuilding stage as Germany once were, have meanwhile dumbed down expectations to a level that just qualifying is considered an achievement.

Alex Horne, the Football Association general secretary, said Roy Hodgson had done enough to justify two more years by simply getting to Brazil. That would never happen in Germany.

As for Greg Dyke’s wish for  England to be judged in 2022 in Qatar - nine years away when he said it - there must have been  guffaws in the fancy home of the German federation.

Why are Germany successful? Because they expect to be successful, they demand success - because their ambition is huge.

If there is a problem it is addressed, but never at the expense of a major tournament. Klinsmann and Low revitalised the game in Germany, but they did not do so for the benefit of some distant point a decade away.

When they began tackling the problems in the German game, issues of identity, style and youth development, they did so with a home World Cup that was two years off in mind. There was, obviously, a longer game involving the identification and production of young talent that has come to fruition, spectacularly, at this World Cup - but Klinsmann’s aims were as much short-term, because he knew his employers, and the country, would not accept that a tournament could be thrown away as a planning exercise.

‘I was always looking long-term but I knew we would be measured by our success at the 2006  World Cup,’ Klinsmann said. ‘I was  basically doubted for the two years I was coach.

‘We lost 4-1 to Italy in a friendly game three months before the tournament and everybody wanted my blood. We had another game three weeks later against the United States, which we won 4-1, and that victory saved my job.

‘The federation had been ready to make a change. They wanted the conservative approach again, not the revolution. But I kept being positive, explaining this was how I wanted us to play. I did not know if we would master it in time for the 2006 World Cup but we would give it a shot.

‘We had the players for four weeks before the tournament and were able to get our thoughts across. They agreed to train the way we wanted them to, and to do extra work. Soon they started to believe in the system.’

So, just to recap: the Germans were prepared to abandon reform because they feared not doing well in a World Cup - and Germany has a different concept of doing well, too, when you consider one of the bouts of introspection was caused by only reaching the quarter-finals.

Might this also explain why they are such serial achievers? Imagine if England’s recent World Cup record read final, semi-final, semi-final, final. Would revolution have been in the air? The FA is an organisation that introduced its own awards ceremony on the back of getting out of the group at the European Championship in 2012.

Klinsmann’s blueprint involved a very attack-minded style of play, moving the ball from front to back as fast as possible, but on the floor. He talked of giving the national team an identity: dynamic football. Has that been the way Germany have played here?

The 7-1 scoreline against Brazil would suggest so, but that isn’t the whole tale. Were Germany dynamic against France in the quarter-final? No, they played a slower, possession-based game, and won from a set-piece goal. Indeed, Germany have scored more goals from  set-pieces than any other team at the World Cup, five by the time Thomas Muller volleyed in the first against Brazil on Tuesday. How so? Enter Herr Flick.

Hans-Dieter Flick has been assistant coach to Low since he succeeded Klinsmann in 2006. For several years now, he has been bemoaning the quality of Germany’s set-piece play.

Low did not have the issue high on his agenda. The pair used to have bets about whether the team could even score from a corner, a good-quality bottle of red wine to the winner. Then the head scout Urs Siegenthaler returned from the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil with the news that set-piece play was going to be absolutely vital at the World Cup in 2014.

If the conditions were tiring it wouldn’t be possible for Germany to play their normal, high-tempo way in every match. They would have, at times, to play slower, possession football and use the breaks in play to their best advantage.

This was what Flick had been waiting to hear. He asked Low for extra sessions geared to set-piece work. Low, moaning and sceptical but trusting of his lieutenant, agreed. One imagines Flick has quite an impressive collection of Rotwein now.

The second goal in the 4-0 win against Portugal, the 2-2 equaliser against Ghana, the only goals of the games against the United States and France, and the opener against Brazil. Not a bad run for a team that cannot score from set-pieces.

Low has also reset the balance between attack and defence, particularly now the brilliant Philipp Lahm has been restored to his full-back role.

Using goalkeeper Manuel Neuer as a glorified sweeper is another innovation that underlines the intellectual ambition of German football. Having as good as invented the role through Franz Beckenbauer in the first place, Germany now drive through the next evolutionary step.

And yes, there are also landmarks in the development of this team - Klinsmann’s 2006 side is one, and the 2009 Under 21 champions that his youth development revolution helped forge are another. Against Brazil, the starting line-up only included two players - Muller and Toni Kroos - who were not either members of the squad in 2006 or 2009. Yet innovation and expectation is every bit as important.

In 1972, West Germany came to Wembley to play England in a European Nations Cup quarter-final. At that time, both countries had won a single World Cup. Indeed, Germany had only recorded their first win over England in 1968, in a friendly.

That night, though, England were played off the park. The match is remembered for a stunning performance by Gunter Netzer, but that wasn’t the half of it.

Horst-Dieter Hottges and Paul Breitner, the full backs, kept switching flanks. English football had never seen  anything like it. Even now, it would be considered revolutionary.

‘They seem to have stood still,’ was coach Helmut Schon’s damning verdict on England. And that is the essence of German success. It is not in one movement, one big idea: it is that they never stand still, they always expect, and they never throw a tournament away.

Final, semi-final, semi-final, final: and that, remember, was in the rebuilding stage.
