Abortion clinics have been accused of offering pregnant women the option to terminate based on the sex of their baby, according to pro-life campaigners.

The organization Live Action sent a pregnant woman into a Planned Parenthood clinic with a hidden camera. During her appointment, she made it clear to the counselor that she will only have a termination if the child is female but would keep a baby boy.

The health adviser supports her decision and even explains how to access Medicare in order to have an ultrasound to determine the sex of the baby before scheduling an abortion around five months into the pregnancy.

Planned Parenthood has condemned Live Action's investigation as a 'hoax' and said the counselor no longer works at the center in south Austin, Texas.

Dubious: A counselor, identified only as Rebecca, helped a pregnant woman schedule her abortion based on the sex of her baby at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Austin, Texas

The pro-life group claimed that the practice was being carried out across the U.S. and that they have a series of tapes showing sex-selective abortions being supported.

In the video, the pregnant woman enters the clinic for an appointment to schedule her abortion.

The woman tells the counselor 'Rebecca' that she is in her first trimester and therefore cannot be certain of her baby's gender.

Reading medical notes, Rebecca said: 'I see that you’re saying that you want to terminate if it’s a girl, so are you just wanting to continue the pregnancy in the meantime?

'The abortion covers you up until 23 weeks and usually at 5 months is when they detect, you know, whether or not it’s a boy or a girl.'

The Planned Parenthood counselor then advises the woman, sitting off-camera, that she could get on Medicaid in order to pay for an 
ultrasound to determine the gender of her baby and use the knowledge for an elective abortion.

She finally suggests the woman 'just continue and try again' for a boy if she has to abort a girl and shows her to the door with the words: 'Good luck, and I hope that you do get your boy.'

Founder and president of Live Action Lila Rose said in a statement to MailOnline: 'The
search-and-destroy targeting of baby girls through prenatal testing and
abortion is a pandemic that is spreading across the globe.

'Research proves that sex-selective 
abortion has now come to America. The abortion industry, led by Planned 
Parenthood, is a willing participant.'

Live
Action is youth-based movement that was started in 2003 by Ms Rose, 
then 15 years old. It is a pro-life organization and describes abortion 
as the 'greatest human rights injustice of our time'.

Decision time: The counselor helps the pregnant woman prepare Medicaid paperwork to have an ultrasound to determine the sex of her baby before she decides whether or not to have a termination

Its undercover investigation was used as a tactic for revealing practices at abortion clinics.

Congress is set to debate the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act (PRENDA) tomorrow which would ban sex-selective abortions across the U.S.

At present, only Illinois, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Arizona prohibit the practice.

The bill would ban abortions performed because of a baby's gender.

If it became law, it would mean that medical staff who suspect a woman is seeking an abortion based on the sex of her baby would have to report her to authorities.

It would also leave doctors who performed the abortions at risk of being sent to prison or lawsuits.

Several health directors have raised concerns that such a law would put minority women at risk, in particular Asian-American women.

The issue of sex selection in Asian countries was highlighted in a report by the World Health Organization last year.

Miriam Yeung, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, said: 'No woman should ever be scrutinized or interrogated by her doctor, but this is exactly what would happen if this bill becomes law.'

Planned Parenthood is a non-profit which
has lobbied for pro-choice for more than 90 years.

In its mission 
statement, its aim 'to empower individuals to 
make independent, informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive
lives'. 

Following what Planned Parenthood described as a 'hoax' campaign, vice president of education Leslie Kantor released a statement.

She said: 'Six weeks ago a former staff member serving in an entry-level position did not follow our protocol for providing information and guidance when presented with a highly unusual patient scenario.

'Within three days of this patient interaction, the staff member’s employment was ended and all staff members at this affiliate were immediately scheduled for retraining in managing unusual patient encounters.

Ms Kantor continued: 'Today opponents of Planned Parenthood are promoting an edited video of that hoax patient encounter.

'Gender bias is contrary to everything our organization works for daily in communities across the country.

'The world’s leading women’s health and rights organizations, including the World Health Organization, do not believe that curtailing access to abortion services is a legitimate means of addressing sex selection, and have made clear that gender bias can only be resolved by addressing the underlying conditions that lead to it.'

The risk of death is higher the later a woman decides to have an abortion. There is one fatality per 6,000 
abortions at 21 weeks and more.

In a press release, Live Action also said that six studies since 2008 have revealed that there are 
thousands of 'missing girls' in the U.S. after sex-selective abortion.

The World Health Organization reported that the biologically normal sex ratio at birth rangesfrom 102 to 106 males per 100 females.

There has been cause for concern in some countries - including India and China - where this ratio has climbed to 130.

Many Asian societies place the family's economic security and future lineage on the heads of sons rather than daughters. It has resulted in pressure, blatant or subtle, on women to produce sons.

There have been numerous initiatives by governments to try to address the issue. Several countries have passed laws against sex-selective abortions and the issue is due to be debated in the U.S. tomorrow as Congress addresses the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act.

WHO reported last year that some countries have introduced direct measures such as scholarship programs for girls or pensions for families which only have girls in an effort to redress the gender bias.
