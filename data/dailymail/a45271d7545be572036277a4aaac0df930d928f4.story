Frank Gillespie has been revealed as the man who is said to have had a bust-up with Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane at Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links in Dublin on Wednesday evening.

Gillespie, who resides in Boston but flew over to watch Ireland take on Scotland at Celtic Park, reportedly asked Keane if he could sign a copy of the former Manchester United midfielder’s autobiography.

Keane rejected the request as he was not happy with what Gillespie wrote in his own book - Confessions From The Blackthorn: Publican Frank Gillespie’s Journey From Tyrrellspass To Boston - which was published 10 years ago.

The confrontation flared up after Roy Keane refused to sign a copy of his autobiography

Gillespie, who is close friends with former Ireland boss Jack Charlton and his son - who is also called Jack, was told: ‘I’m not signing your book.’

Gillespie, who is in his 50s, then ripped out pages of Keane’s book - The Second Half - before getting into an altercation with the 43-year-old Aston Villa assistant manager.

Gillespie came into contact with a coffee table during the confrontation before the police and an ambulance were called to the scene. He then spent 10 hours at Beaumont Hospital.

In a show of support for Keane, Ireland manager Martin O’Neill took the unusual move of issuing a video statement on Thursday.

He said: ‘The FAI and I have been fully briefed about the circumstances of what happened at the team hotel.

‘Roy asked that the gardai [police] were called and he has notified them of what has happened. While this process is ongoing we are unable to say more at this point.

‘However having been made aware of the facts, I can say Roy has both my full support and the full support of the FAI, and John Delaney (FAI chief executive).

‘We are now focused as we have been all week on the game in hand and we won’t be saying anything more about this issue.’

Keane’s legal advisers have studied CCTV footage since the incident and his Ireland colleagues continue to support him.
