A southwestern Missouri man has been charged with four counts of murder in the killing of three people, including a pregnant woman and her fetus.

Twenty-five-year-old Brian Williams of Sparta appeared in court Tuesday and was jailed without bond on four counts of first-degree murder and armed criminal action.

Investigators allege in a probable cause statement that Williams shot 27-year-old James Marsh; Marsh's pregnant girlfriend, 26-year-old Casey Maples; and 40-year-old Christina Winden at a mobile home in Ozark, Missouri.

Williams is also accused of killing Maples' unborn child that a pathologist says was 7 or 8 weeks old. Maples was a mother of two. 

Authorities haven't revealed a motive. 

The probable-cause statement says Williams told investigators he does not regret his actions, including killing Maples with the knowledge that she was pregnant.

Wished: Williams told detectives he only wished Winden's boyfriend had been in the home so he could have killed him too

He said he only wished Winden's boyfriend had been in the home so he could have killed him too.

Williams told detectives of how he murdered the victims early Friday after forcing his way into the mobile home where he lived at one point.

He described his actions as 'calm, but with a purpose.' 

He told detectives that he wore a lamp shade on his head as he walked down the hallway and found Maples and Marsh asleep in the first bedroom, KYTV reports.

Victims: James Marsh, 27 (left), was laying with Maples, his girlfriend (right) when Williams entered their bedroom and shot the two multiple times

He said he shot Maples multiple times as the two slept using a 9mm handgun and shot Marsh in the head and chest when he started to sit up. 

He then walked to the master bedroom, he told detectives, where Winden was sitting up in the bed. He shot her once in the head and left the room.

He heard Marsh gasping for breath so he returned to the first bedroom and shot Marsh once more before going through the victim's wallets to retrieve property that, he said, belonged to his girlfriend. 

Williams was driving a stolen white pickup truck, according to KYTV. He said he disposed of the handgun and burned the jacket he wore when committing the murders, he told police that he planned to dispose of the pickup truck by burning it.

Williams is also charged with tampering with a motor vehicle and stealing a gun.

He is being held without bond and his next court date is set for March 17.

Williams is also being charged with two counts of manufacturing meth for a meth lab police found in the mobile home on Dec. 26. 

Williams' rap sheet spans back to 2008 and includes stealing and burglary, according to KYTV. He is charged as a prior and persistent offender, which could enhance the 25-year-old's prison sentence if convicted.
