Privileges reinstated: Dr Shakil Khan Afridi was allowed to see family last Wednesday after a 10-month ban on visitors following an interview he gave Fox News

The doctor who helped the CIA locate Osama Bin Laden is finally getting visits from his family at the Pakistani prison where he is being jailed.

Dr Shakil Khan Afridi was convicted to 33 years in prison in May 2012 for 'acting against the state.'

When the CIA was trying to confirm Bin Laden's presence in the Abbottabad compound, they sent Dr Afridi in under the auspices of giving out hepatitis B vaccinations.  

Investigators hoped the vaccinations would provide DNA evidence to confirm who was in the compound.

While
Afridi was unsuccessful with the vaccinations, he was able to provide 
enough details for the CIA to go through with their raid.

When
the Pakistani government found out that one of their own was being used
as a spy for the U.S. agency, he was arrested and tried for treason.

In
a surprising move, the Pakistanis tried him under a British-era 
regulation that didn't carry the death sentence, unlike the standard 
treason charge.

He was convicted and has been serving his sentence at Central Prison in Peshawar.

When he spoke to Fox News last year about his treatment by the Pakistanis, he was banned from all meetings.

Last month, that ban was lifted after 10 months. On Wednesday, Afridi was finally able to meet with his wife, Imrana Ghafur, and their three children, between the ages 10 and 15, according to Fox News.

Other
sources told Fox that privileges such as being able to receive 
food and clothing from family members have been reinstated for Afridi.

Afridi's
brother, Jamil Afiridi has since tried to visit the prison but was told
that only the wife and children were on the list of approved visitors.

Not even his lawyers are allowed to meet with their client.

'We
are not aware they met, and how did authorities get in touch with them 
(the family) without notifying us?' one of Afridi's lawyers asked.

But they remain optimistic that the doctor will have his sentence cut short.

'I
think things are changing and moving rapidly,' said the lawyer. 'I feel
that something good will happen soon and freedom (for Afridi) will be 
achieved'

Afridi's next hearing is on July 18.

The U.S. has been pushing hard for Afridi's release ever since he was imprisoned.

After Afridi's help with the raid, CIA agents told him that he should seek shelter in Afghanistan with his family.

Pivotal: Dr Afridi gained important details from his visit to the compound where Bin Laden was hiding out - details that helped the CIA with their raid

Afridi
didn't want to risk traveling through the dangerous Pashtun tribal 
region on the Pakistan -Afghanistan border, so he decided to stay in his
home country. 

He 
didn't know that Bin Laden was in the facility he investigated, so he 
didn't think he was at risk of angering the Pakistani government.

Since his imprisonment several American officials have called for his release.

'The
doctor was never asked to spy on Pakistan,' a senior American official 
told the New York Times. 'He was asked only to help locate Al Qaeda 
terrorists, who threaten Pakistan and the U.S. He helped save Pakistani 
and American lives.'

Former
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also called for Afridi's release. Last 
September, Senator Rand Paul propositioned cutting off aid for Pakistan 
if the doctor was not released to the U.S.
