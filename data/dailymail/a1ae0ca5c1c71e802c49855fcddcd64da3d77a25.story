Determined to break through the thick mist, the Saturday morning sun has raised hopes for a warm end to September.

Despite the foggy start, Britain is set to enjoy a final blaze of sunshine over the coming days, continuing the glorious sunshine seen over the Autumnal equinox.

However, forecasters have warned that although the country will enjoy higher than average temperatures, certain regions face a 'mixed bag' as two systems battle over the UK.

This could trigger strong winds and heavy rains, broken by sunny spells.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'Temperatures are looking slightly above average over the weekend and into next week.

'There is some rain about and some of it is quite heavy with the risk of thunder, mainly in the South-west.

'But elsewhere it will be drier with sunny spells, and it is a similar picture on Sunday and into the beginning of next week.

Britain will enjoy higher than average temperatures in the coming days, while experts predict this autumn will be one of the most colourful in memory

'There is high pressure over the 
North and low pressure over the South and the weather is uncertain 
depending on which way they go, it is a bit of a mixed bag.'

Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, suggests temperatures could be as high as 60F to 70F next week.

Mr Powell explained: 'We are certainly going to hold onto the warmth over the next few days and into next week.

'But
there is a risk of some very heavy showers in the mix, particularly in 
the South, and coastal regions could see some strong winds.

'There are currently two weather systems battling it out over the country, and this could make things quite unsettled.'

Experts
predict the country will be awash with vivid colours as trees change 
from green to deep reds, golds and yellows, and promise a bumper fruit 
and nut crops in the coming weeks.

Matthew Oates, a National Trust naturalist, has put the glorious start to autumn down to a wet spring and warm summer.

He
said: 'The leaves colour up particularly well after a hot summer, which
we’ve just had. Frost and very wet weather impact on leaf colour too.

'It’s
not a definite science. The early indicators are good. It could be a 
really good autumn for colour. It is a wonderful autumn for berries and 
fruits. It could well be a great one too for our leaf colour.'
