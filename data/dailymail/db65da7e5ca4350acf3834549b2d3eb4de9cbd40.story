It is a question that troubles all new parents (and plenty of not-so-new ones).

Can you still stay in a luxury hotel when you have a little one – sticky hands, nighttime crying, random wanderings – in tow? And if so, what will said hotel do to help you?

The answers, in turn are: ‘Yes, of course you can.’ And ‘Quite a lot, actually.’

Can we check in too, please? Luxury hotels do not have to be child-free zones

Here, Tracey Davies of Family Traveller – the magazine for anyone thinking of going on holiday with children – picks out seven splendid hotels which will not only look after your kids, but make them feel as welcome as any adult guest.

The Ritz-Carlton Cancun: Grown-up fun in the sun, but also plentiful facilities for children

From a baby-friendly telephone which lights up instead of ringing, to the canopy-covered cots and miniature clothes-hangers in the wardrobe, the Ritz-Carlton Cancun's Itzy Bitzy Ritz Kids rooms have been elegantly furnished with their smallest guests in mind.

All rooms come with the hotel's Protect Our Little Ones (POLO) pack, which features baby toiletries, bath tap covers and plug protectors – plus a first-aid kit which includes nappy rash cream.

There is also a kids' camp for older siblings, and a baby-friendly splash pool – plus an army of babysitters to make this an ideal beachside retreat for teeny globetrotters.

Travel Facts: Itzy Bitzy Ritz Kids rooms start at £207 per room per night (0052 998 881 0808; www.ritzcarlton.com).

The Mandarin Oriental: A hotel in a big city of bright lights - but with much for little people to enjoy

For baby's first taste of the Orient, head east to the iconic Mandarin Oriental on Hong Kong Island.

While the hotel's dazzling views across Victoria Harbour might be wasted on tiny travellers, they will appreciate the rooms kitted out with cots, changing mats, baby baths and toiletries. A further array of paraphernalia is available on request including highchairs, pushchairs, bottle warmers and sterilisers.

And while your little prince or princess lounges in the covetable mini-robe, parents can take advantage of the hotel's professional babysitting services and slip off to the glamorous 25th floor M Bar to indulge in a few cocktails.

Travel Facts: Two-bedroom family suites start at £712 per night, including breakfast, treats for the kids and a bottle of champagne for mum and dad (00853 2522 011; www.mandarinoriental.com).

More than a beach: Kids can learn to craft their own sushi via the KidsOnly facilities at the Reethi Rah resort

Even when surrounded by snow-white sandy beaches and the aquamarine waters of the Indian Ocean, little poppets will still get mucky. But ditch the travel wash – the One & Only Reethi Rah resort in the Maldives provides a free laundry service for all babies under two.

Tucked under shady palms, the family beach villas are furnished with cots, bottle warmers and baby monitors. There is a toddler-friendly splash pool, a children's activity programme and a dedicated ‘KidsOnly’ menu, which features the head chef's finest fruit and vegetable purees.

Travel Facts: Rooms start at £653 per night (00960 664 8800; reethirah.oneandonlyresorts.com).

Africa for little angels: Children can head out for pony rides at Kurland on South Africa's Garden Route

Nestled between the Outeniqua Mountains and the Indian Ocean, this luxury Cape Dutch boutique hotel boasts a clutch of elegant family rooms, all cuter than a pixie's pocket.

All are furnished with proper cots, high-chairs and baby monitors, and feature a colourful children's loft room decked out with cosy cushions and rugs – plus buckets of toys and teddies to keep little nippers happy. Nannies can be pre-booked. There is also a playroom – and even Shetland pony rides for babies over one.

A children's supper is served daily. However, if your little darling only eats ice cream on toast, the chef is more than happy to cater to the whims of picky eaters.

Travel Facts: Luxury family suites start at £174 per room per night, including breakfast and taxes. (0117 946 7072; www.i-escape.com).

Welcoming: The Emirates Palace is one of the world's most luxurious hotels, but it knows how to cater to children - with facilities including a dedicated kids' TV channel and a range of toiletries specifically for babies

If opulence and luxury need to be a key part of your baby's first holiday, this grand Arabian-style palace overlooking the turquoise sweep of the Arabian Gulf has it in jewel-encrusted spades. Decadently styled family rooms are furnished with everything babies need, from air humidifiers, pushchairs and baby monitors to swimming nappies, baby bottles and potties.

There is even a dedicated kids' TV channel, and a DVD player for those pre-dawn Disney marathons. The elaborate marble bathrooms are kitted out with a babies'-own range of toiletries, plus cutesy mini-robes and slippers.

Travel Facts: Diamond rooms sleep two adults and a baby – from £318 per room per night (00971 2 690 9000; www.kempinski.com).

Grand moments: The Ickworth Hotel is Suffolk at its most stately - but kids can clamber over the furniture

‘Don't touch!’ is a phrase babies and toddlers will rarely hear in this grand country estate in Suffolk.

Little ones are not just catered for, but thoroughly encouraged to crawl through its stately halls and climb over the expensive furniture in this family-friendly boutique hotel.

Rooms come equipped with all you might need, from cots and bottle warmers to sterilisers, Bugaboos and a fridge.

Canadian cool: The Trump Hotel in Toronto can provide guests with concierges to cater to all baby needs

The uber-glamorous Trump Hotel in Toronto certainly goes that extra mile for its tiny guests.

Rooms are kitted out with proper cots lined with posh linen, rocking chairs, baby monitors and pushchairs - while a dedicated 'Trump Attaché' (concierge) will baby-proof the room and pre-stock it with nappies and formula milk. They can also book nannies or babysitters, and seek out tot-friendly activities like local playgroups and classes around the city.
