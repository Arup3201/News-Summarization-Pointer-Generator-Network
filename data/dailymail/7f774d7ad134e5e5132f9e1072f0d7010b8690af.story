James Taylor has been made to sweat to earn his place in England’s faltering one-day side. On Sunday in Colombo, as he improvised his way to 90 in an innings that should guarantee him a World Cup place, the point was made literally.

Six times Taylor was forced by unsparing 40-degree heat and 90 per cent humidity to change his drenched gloves.

And on Monday morning his left forearm, which cramped up moments before he miscued Ajantha Mendis into the covers, sported a bruise unwittingly inflicted by the England physio as he tried to restore the limb to full working order.

It would be wrong to call the purple splodge a war wound. 

But Taylor’s arrival at a place where he can begin to think in terms of an international career has been something of a battle.

‘It has been a frustrating couple of years waiting for my chance,’ he said after what was only his third one-day international since his debut in Ireland in 2011. 

‘It was nice to prove a point to a lot of people, but I knew I could do it.

‘I have scored plenty of runs in county cricket, but every time I have stepped out in the Lions shirt I scored runs against international attacks too, so I knew I could do it against international teams.

‘It was just actually stepping up and doing it on the big stage – which I managed to do.’

On a tour where so far only Moeen Ali, to a lesser extent Chris Woakes, and now indisputably Taylor have enhanced their one-day credentials, England are crying out for good-news stories.

Some may be wondering why this one took so long to be told.

Taylor’s average in List A one-day cricket now stands at 53 from 102 matches. 

Among batsmen to have played a minimum of 50 innings, that places him third on the all-time list – behind only Australia’s finisher extraordinaire Michael Bevan (57) and India’s Cheteshwar Pujara (54).

He has also made 12 centuries and hit 56 sixes – not bad for a player mocked for his size in Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography.

‘I am pretty sure there have been a lot of small batsmen,’ he said. ‘Some of the greatest players have been small, and I am definitely not the smallest guy to play cricket.

‘As you saw yesterday, I can hit the ball over the ropes – and if you can do that then height doesn’t matter.’ 

The middle-order batsman launches a six down the ground off Ajantha Mendis

The six he launched off seamer Thisara Perera over midwicket from somewhere around off stump calmed his nerves after he had taken 29 balls to reach 11. And the one he hit later down the ground off the so-called mystery spin of Mendis confirmed it was no fluke. 

Just as pertinently, Taylor’s innings has left the one-day selectors with an unusual complaint: a nice headache.

With Alastair Cook set to return for Wednesday’s fifth one-dayer at Pallekele following his one-match ban for slow over-rates, England must leave out a batsman.

For now, though, Taylor is determined to turn Sunday’s innings into the start of something special. ‘I wanted to get a few more runs, but I showed people glimpses of what I can do,’ he said.

A piece may just have been slotted into England’s World Cup jigsaw.
