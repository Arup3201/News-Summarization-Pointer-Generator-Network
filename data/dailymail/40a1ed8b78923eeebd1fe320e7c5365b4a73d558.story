The Queen paid a sartorial nod to the icy weather that was creeping across Britain with her Sunday worship outfit this morning.

Her Majesty conjured up images of the Snow Queen in the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale in her chic cream ensemble, complete with large fur hat and matching cuffs as she arrived at St. Mary Magdalene church for the 11am service.

To ward off the chill, the royal also added a blue blanket to her layers during the short drive in her chauffeur-driven Bentley across the Sandringham Estate.

Her Majesty conjured up images of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale The Snow Queen in her chic cream ensemble, complete with large fur hat and matching cuffs as she arrived at St. Mary Magdalene church for the Sunday Service this morning 

The Queen was forced to cancel a visit to Mary the Virgin church in Hillington, Norfolk, because of falling plaster from the ceiling. So instead, she attended St. Mary Magdalene on the Sandringham estate 

A last minute change of plans had forced the Queen to change her Sunday worship routine due to a health and safety hazard at the church she was scheduled to attend today, but she still saw the day through in perfect regal style. 

The royal was supposed to visit St Mary the Virgin church at Hillington, slightly further away on the Sandringham estate, but the service was cancelled after a lump of plaster fell off the ceiling on New Year's Eve.

Church officials decided it was too dangerous to admit members of the public because of the risk of more plaster falling and injuring someone.

So, instead of journeying three miles to Hillington, the Queen, 88, was chauffeured in a Bentley to St. Mary Magdalene church instead, which is around 400 yards from Sandringham House, for the Sunday morning service.

The Duke of Edinburgh braved the cold and walked to the church for the service. He appeared to say something to the police officer who saluted him as he walked past on the way to St Mary Magdalene this morning 

The pair seem to have cracked a joke, as they pass each other in high spirits 

Her husband Prince Philip, 93, decided to brave the elements by walking to join her at church in the winter sunshine, wearing his trademark long brown coat. 

Hillington church warden Edward Dawnay, 64, admitted that locals had been disappointed not to be hosting the Queen at their church this weekend.  

He said: 'We had a bit of plaster fall on the pulpit on New Year's Eve. It was not really a big deal - it was really just a dustpan and brush job to clear up.

'But it was decided that we could not hold our service on the first Sunday of the month or the one this Sunday, in case something else happened.

'The plaster certainly did not fall in the area where the Queen normally sits, but it was agreed that we should not take any risks.

'It is a shame for Hillington because people were looking forward to the Queen visiting. We hope she will be able to come next year instead.'

 The Queen and Prince Philip worship most Sundays at St Mary Magdalene church during their festive break as well as on Christmas Day when they are joined by other members of the Royal family.But on the third Sunday in January, the 11am service which they attend is traditionally moved to one of four other churches in the area

Mr Dawnay said that scaffolding was due to be erected inside the church this week to allow a repair to be made.

Surveyors will also carry out an inspection to make sure that no other parts of the ceiling are in danger of collapse before officials agree to re-open the church.

He said it was possible that the plaster collapse had happened because of a tile on the roof becoming dislodged more than two years ago, which may have then let in water. 

He said: 'The tile was repaired at the time, but a small amount of water may have entered.

'The bit of plaster that fell away was directly below the tile so it may be linked. 

'It was only the plaster that fell, not the wood part of the ceiling.'

The Queen complemented her wintry look with ruby red lipstick and a pair of elegant pearl earrings

But on the third Sunday in January, the 11am service which they attend is traditionally moved to one of four other churches in the area.

The honour is usually given to a different church every year and on Sunday it was due to be Hillington.

A notice explaining the cancellation of the service and expressing 'great disappointment' was posted on the church door.
