The 'Hit King' is taking another swing at returning to baseball.

Pete Rose, who agreed to a lifetime ban from Major League Baseball in 1989 after an investigation found he bet on the Cincinnati Reds to win while managing the team, has submitted a new request to be reinstated. 

The career hits leader (4,256) applied for reinstatement in September 1997 and met in November 2002 with previous MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who never ruled on the application.

Rob Manfred succeeded Selig in January and has already said that Rose will be involved in the 2015 All Star Game in July at the Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, according to Yahoo. 

Manfred said after meeting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in spring training on Monday that he has a formal request from Rose.

He said: 'What I intend to do is be in communication with his representatives, and we'll talk about how we'll handle it from a process perspective.'

Rose, who turns 74 next month, denied for 15 years that he bet on baseball. In his 2004 autobiography, Pete Rose: My Prison Without Bars, he came clean about betting on the Reds. 

The new commissioner was not involved in the investigation into Rose's gambling as it was handled by outside lawyer John Dowd.

He said: 'I want to make sure I understand all of the details in the Dowd Report and commissioner Bart Giamatti's decision.

'I want to hear what Pete has to say, and I'll make a decision.'

Rose won the World Series in 1975 and 1976 with the Reds and  in 1980 while he was a member of the Phillies

If Manfred did reinstate Rose, it would be a step towards him eventually reaching Cooperstown. 

The Hall of Fame voted to ban players on the permanently ineligible list from induction in 1991.

Even if Rose is put back on the Baseball Writers' Association of America  ballot, members of the group will not necessarily vote him in despite his Hall of Fame-worthy statistics.

In addition to managing the Reds, Rose also played for the team for nearly 20 seasons and helped the club win the World Series in 1975 and 1976.

He also won the World Series as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1980. 

Manfred is a member of the Hall of Fame board, but he said he has not spoken with the Hall about its plans for Rose, according to ESPN.

He said: 'Honestly, I don't think people should read any disposition into what I'm saying about this. 

'I see it as a really simple thing. He's made a request.

'Part of my obligations under the major league constitution is to deal with those requests, and I'll deal with it.'

These days, Rose spends his time is Las Vegas signing baseballs for money. 

That may not fit the lifestyle commissioner Giamatti suggested when the ban agreement was announced.

Giamatti said at the time: 'The burden is entirely on Mr Rose to reconfigure his life in a way he deems appropriate.
