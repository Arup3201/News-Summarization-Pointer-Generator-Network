Drivers in Russia were treated to unusual sight as they negotiated a busy motorway in the city of Kemerovo on Saturday night.

An object, thought to be a meteor, blasted through the sky above a busy road before disappearing into the darkness.

One motorist managed to catch the unusual phenomenon on a dashboard camera, showing the glowing ball shoot across the sky at high speed.  

Eyewitnesses in the cities of Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk and Osinniki spotted the UFO on Saturday night.

They claim the alleged meteor fell silently at a high speed and became extinct shortly afterwards.

The short video shows a bright light appear on the upper left area of the sky before arcing towards the right of the screen in just four seconds.

It is still unknown what exactly the ball of light was, although eyewitnesses said they believed it was a meteor.

It is not the first time this month that members of the public have reported seeing unusual objects in the sky.

Earlier this month, eyewitnesses in the US reported seeing a a bright object that broke apart into three separate pieces with red glowing streaks.

A glowing 'rocks' were visible from New Mexico to Montana.

Military experts believed the UFO was a Russian spy satellite, although Russia denied the claim.

The object probably was a piece of Russia's Cosmos 2495 reconnaissance satellite, launched in May, said Charles Vick, an aerospace analyst with military information website Globalsecurity.org. 

Cosmos 2495 was designed to shoot reconnaissance photos and send the film back to Earth in capsules.
