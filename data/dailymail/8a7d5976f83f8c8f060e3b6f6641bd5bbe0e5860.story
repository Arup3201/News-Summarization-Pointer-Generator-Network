Bonnie, 10, has been dubbed the 'wimpiest dog in the UK' because she is scared of the slightest sounds

She also hates being left alone and needs constant reassurance from her carers to soothe her severe anxiety

When it comes to walkies, she can only go out during the hours of daylight as she is terrified of the dark.

Canine carer Julie Allan said: 'Bonnie gets scared by so many noises when out on walks so we constantly reassure her and make sure we keep her distracted with treats and lots of fuss but she is really affectionate so is always happy to have a cuddle.

'Our wee Bonnie is such a special girl we really hope she finds the safe, loving home she deserves.'

Bonnie arrived at the re-homing centre in Glasgow four years ago when her owner was no longer able to take care of her.

Despite her phobias, staff at the centre said she would make a loving pet and loves people - she just needs a new owner to help her conquer her fears.

Emma Louise Livingston, Dogs Trust Glasgow supporter relations officer, said: 'Dogs Trust Glasgow training and behaviour advisers do all they can to reassure Bonnie and help her to conquer her fears but what she really needs is her new best friend to help her settle into a new routine in a loving new home.

'What this gentle girl lacks in courage she more than makes up for in affection as she absolutely adores her carers and is happy to be fussed all day long.

'She is a beautiful girl who deserves a home to call her own, as she can get spooked by other dogs, Bonnie needs to be the only dog in the home.

'Bonnie needs a patient owner in a quiet adult home who will help her settle in and take her on long stress free walks where she feels safe to help her view the world outside the Rehoming Centre in a new light.

'She has so much love to give and has never given up on people despite her tough start in life, she really is a dog in a million and we are desperate for her to find a safe loving home.

'She deserves a chance to see that life really isn't as scary as she thinks!'
