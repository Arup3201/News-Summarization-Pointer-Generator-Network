Anger: Jamie Oliver said he was 'totally mystified' by the Education Department allowing academies to opt out of strict nutrition rules for pupils' school dinners

Jamie Oliver yesterday furiously accused Michael Gove of allowing junk food to return to school canteens and vending machines.

The television chef spoke out against 
the Education Secretary for allowing academy schools to opt out of the 
tough national school food rules inspired by his Jamie’s School Dinners 
documentaries and Feed Me Better campaign.

Condemning Mr Gove’s approach as ‘Big 
Society bull****’, Oliver claimed some academies were providing food 
that would fail the nutrition test amid a child obesity crisis.

Council caterers’ leaders said cases 
had come to light of academies serving plates of chips and filling 
vending machines with chocolate bars and sweets.

The rules state school vending 
machines should only sell healthy snacks such as fruit, nuts and bottles
of water.

Meanwhile strict nutrition standards govern canteen meals and
curtail levels of fat, salt and sugar.

More than half of England’s 3,261 
secondary schools are now independent academies or in the process of 
converting. Funded directly from Whitehall, they operate outside council
influence.

Mr Gove has resisted forcing them to adopt the food rules, while council-maintained schools  are legally obliged to comply.

Oliver said he was ‘totally mystified’
by the minister’s approach. ‘We don’t want bull**** about the Big 
Society. We want a strategy to stop Britain being the fifth most 
unhealthy country in the world.

‘This is the first generation of kids 
not expected to live as long as their parents. Tell me, Mr Gove and 
[Health Secretary] Andrew Lansley, how you plan to change that? Two out 
of five kids are obese. What is in your arsenal? The fact is they are 
doing nothing.’

Campaign: Jamie's Return to School Dinners saw the TV chef continue his push to improve children's nutrition

The Local Authority Caterers’ 
Association said it was aware of bad habits creeping in which had not 
been seen since standards for secondary school meals were introduced in 
2009.

Confident: Michael Gove has resisted forcing academies to adopt the strict rules on nutrition for pupils

National chairman Lynda Mitchell said:
‘I’ve come across an academy school where pupils have been allowed to 
go through with a plate of chips and a piece of cake.

‘It is about high volumes of pupils 
and turning a profit.’ She also said she had seen several examples of 
vending machines in academies selling confectionery.

Oliver said head teachers ‘need some 
expertise and guidance’. ‘It is there. It exists. Why not make it apply 
to all schools?’ he said.

The Department for Education said: ‘We trust schools to act in the best interests of their pupils.

‘The tough nutrition standards remain in place in maintained schools and set a clear benchmark for the rest.’

Government-commissioned research into academy meals will be published in the next few weeks.
