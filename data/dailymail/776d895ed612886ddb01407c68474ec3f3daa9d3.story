A couple in Michigan whose dogs fatally mauled a jogger is being held on $500,000 bond  each, as court officials worry they might try to flee the country if released.

Lapeer County prosecutors wanted $1 million, saying Valbona Lucaj and husband Sebastiano Quagliata, both charged with second-degree murder, might try to escape.

But Magistrate Mike Delling settled on a lower amount Friday, although he noted there was 'some question' about the couple's status in the US.

Both are undocumented immigrants, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Lucaj and Quagliat are charged with the July 23 death of Craig Sytsma, of Livonia, who was attacked by their cane corsos while he jogged along a rural road.

Sytsma, 46, was unconscious when he was taken to a hospital, where 
he died of his injuries, police said.

'It's a horrible tragedy,' assistant prosecutor Michael Hodges said. 'But animal cases get a lot of attention.'

Prosecutors say Valbona Lucaj and husband Sebastiano Quagliata might try to flee if they're released on bond. Lucaj, a native of Albania, and Quagliata, of Italy, are undocumented immigrants

Lucaj, 44, a native of Albania, and Quagliata, 45, a native of Italy, have had a long-running legal battle with federal immigration officials after arriving here in the late 1990s.

Lucaj was named in a bribery scandal involving an immigration official in New York, although she wasn't charged. The government said she and other immigrants paid a middleman to ensure they would be granted asylum.

The government in 2010 took some steps toward deporting Lucaj and Quagliata, but legal challenges have stalled the process, court records show.

In March, a federal judge in Detroit refused to overturn a decision rejecting the couple's application for naturalization.

'Given the posture of their immigration cases, ICE has not yet initiated removal proceedings against either individual,' said Khaalid Walls, a Detroit spokesman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.

'ICE will, however, continue to closely monitor the matter and take appropriate enforcement action once the local criminal proceedings are resolved.'

Attack: Two cane corsos attacked Craig Sytsma

The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said.

'He was jogging, doing what everybody else does out there, running and riding bikes,' Metamora Township police Officer Sean Leathers told the Detroit Free Press.

According to police, a man mowing his lawn nearby saw the attack, got a gun and tried to shoot at the animals to chase them off.

The dogs have been quarantined at the Lapeer County Animal Shelter.

A hearing on whether they will be put down was re-scheduled from Friday.

Sytsma was a 'a divorced father of three' and 'had apparently decided to jog after leaving work,' the newspaper reported.

WXYZ reported that Sytsma survived a battle with colon cancer last year.

'He was very competitive,' said friend Mark Raitanen who knew him for 23 years and spoke to the Detroit Free Press.

Raitanen said he jogged, played hockey, and golfed, as well as regularly riding his mountain bike and playing beach volley ball.

A huge music fan who was partial to Santana, the Allman Brothers, and Gov't Mule, he went to several shows a year but still listened to cassette tapes. 

Scene: Sytsma was running on this road when he was mauled by the two dogs

But more than anything he was a family man who cherished his children Tyra, 16, Jordan, 23, and Luis, 28.

'He was a dad, he was a family man,' Raitanen said.

Son Jordan said that while his father fought cancer at the age of 23, he would rarely speak of it. 

'I’d
 say, ‘I’m here for you, Pop,’ but I wouldn‘t ask questions,' Jordan 
Sytsma said.

In May 2012, there was a report of a 
dog bite where the animal returned to the same property, Metamora 
Township Police Chief David Mallett told The Flint Journal.

And in November 2013, a man was taken to a hospital after being bitten by a dog that returned to the address.

Mallett told the newspaper he didn't know whether the same dog or dogs were involved.

Victim: April Smith, pictured, was attacked by one of the dogs in April 2012

The dogs 'get loose kind of regularly,' Geoffrey Petz told the Flint Journal.

'I've had interactions where I was walking out of my grandma's pole barn and there was a dog standing there with its hair standing up, growling at you,' he told the newspaper. 'When you get that feeling, you can see it in an animal if it's scared or aggressive and you just back right back into the door.'

Oxford resident April Smith told the Free Press, however, that one of the dogs involved on Wednesday attacked her in May 2012. Smith said she and her sister were walking two dogs when she was bitten. She said she was horrified that the owner still had the dogs.

'It's just crazy to me,' Smith told the newspaper. 'Animal control should have done something. It should have never gone this far. The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.'

Some people in past dog attacks in Michigan have been charged. A Livingston County woman whose American bulldogs in September 2007 fatally mauled two people, including a 91-year-old man, was sentenced to prison in 2008. She pleaded no contest to two felony counts of keeping dangerous animals causing death and a misdemeanor charge of allowing her dogs to stray.
