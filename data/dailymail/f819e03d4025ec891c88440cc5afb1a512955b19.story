Jose Mourinho has said that Chelsea are a stronger side this season without David Luiz, and they will only miss him on a personal level.

The Brazilian defender moved to PSG this summer for £50m, making him the world's most expensive defender, but the Chelsea manager has claimed the Brazilian would not have even started for the west London club.

When asked by the Sunday people if he would miss the 27-year-old, Mourinho said: 'As a central defender not at all, it was John Terry and Gary Cahill the whole season.

Better off without him: Jose Mourinho said David Luiz was unlikely to have started in midfield or defence

'In midfield he was an physical guy and gave us important things, especially in the Champions League when Matic couldn't play.

'But this season Matic can play in the Champions League so we don't lose that physicality.

'The fact we have Cesc Fabregas moves us in a different direction. It's something that our football needs and we want to go in that direction.'

However, the the 51-year-old did admit that Luiz brought a lot to the team off the pitch.

He said: 'David
 did important things here, was always good professional and we will 
miss him as a good guy. But from a football point of view we believe our
 squad is stronger this season than it was.'
