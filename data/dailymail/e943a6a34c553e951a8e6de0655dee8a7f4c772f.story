A man has been found dead in New York City after apparently 'surfing' on top of a moving subway, according to police.

Authorities say the man, 45-year-old architect Isabel Rios, suffered a fatal head injury after climbing onto the roof of the No. 6 train between Whitlock Avenue and Elder Avenue.

The NYPD said Mr Rios hit his head on a piece of the subway's infrastructure around 10.15pm local time on Wednesday.

'Subway surfing is simply one of the dumbest things you can do,' MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz told dnainfo.com. 'Don't do it.'

Rios's body was later discovered on top of the train at Soundview in the Bronx. He was unresponsive and pronounced dead immediately.

His fiancee's mother, Carol Parkman, told the Wall Street Journal that Rios was 'a really troubled artist'.

'He was very gifted and very talented,' she said. 'I admired his talent and his work.'

In 2011 a YouTube video of a 'subway surfer' went viral in New York after he was pictured hanging onto the outside of a J Train.

Last October a homeless man, also 45, died in Manhattan's Upper East Side when he hit his head while surfing the No. 6 and fell between the carriages.
