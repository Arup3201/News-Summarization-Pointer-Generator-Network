Two former college football players are being accused of brutally beating a 50-year-old homeless man within an inch of his life in an attack in Suffolk County, Massachusetts last January.

Craig Parsons, a former Boston College tight-end, and Anthony Varrichione, an ex-quarterback at Marist College, were in court Wednesday to faces charges for the incident that happened around 2am on January 26 in the Allston neighborhood .

The high school friends stood next to each other, hands clasped, as they were charged with assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon â€” their shoes. Parsons also was charged with intimidating a witness. The two men pleaded not guilty and left the court without speaking to reporters.

Parsons' attorney, Michael Doolin, said his client was wrongfully identified. 'C.J. is a good kid from a good family. We are hopeful that he will be exonerated,' he said. Varrichione's lawyer, Tim Flaherty, said the same of his client. Neither attorney would comment further on the allegations.

The charges stem from a grand jury investigation in which several witnesses identified the two men, said Jake Wark, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney's office.

The victim, Michael Hudson, was panhandling for money outside a property in Allston when he got in an argument with the two, prosecutors wrote in court documents. When Hudson refused to leave, the men violently attacked him, prosecutors said. Witnesses called police and the two men only stopped when a woman jumped between them, shielding Hudson with her own body.

Hudson was transported to a local hospital for a subarachnoid hemorrage and was hospitalized for three days, according to Wark. He lost all memory of the attack.

While Verrichione graduated from Marist in the fall, Parsons (pictured above at a BC game in November 2012) was set to graduate this spring but has been barred from campus

While Hudson was homeless most of his life, he had recently secured housing in the Allston neighborhood.

Parsons, 22, of Newton, Massachusetts, is a Boston College senior. He was suspended and barred from campus less than a month before graduation, according to university spokesman Jack Dunn, who referred to the allegations as 'disturbing' in a statement Wednesday.

'In light of these disturbing allegations, Craig Parsons has been issued a summary suspension from Boston College,â€™' Dunn said in an email. 'He will have no access to the campus until the matter is resolved. â€˜'

Varrichione, 23, of Medway, Massachusetts, was a quarterback at Marist and graduated from the New York school in the fall.

According to bios on their colleges' websites, each man is over 6 feet tall and weighs more than 200 pounds. They previously were teammates at Xaverian Brothers, a Catholic high school in Westwood, Mass.

They are due back in Suffolk Superior Court on June 4.
