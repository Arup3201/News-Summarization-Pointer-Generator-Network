Liverpool scouts have watched Inter Milan this season and the Croatia international has been linked with a move to Anfield.

However, Kovacic’s representative, Nikky Vuksan, insists the midfielder will remain at San Siro.

But Kovacic's representative insists that the Croatia midfielder will not be leaving Inter Milan

Kovacic has caught the attention of Arsenal and Everton as well as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers

'It is not going to happen. Mateo extended his contract with Inter in January. Could it be that clubs are negotiating? No, that is not possible without Mateo and me knowing about it. 

'Also, I have a player at Liverpool, Dejan Lovren so I would know about it. Both the English and Italian media speculate and find new clubs that want Kovacic every week. He’ll stay at Inter.'

Talking to Croatia newspaper Vecernji list, he added: 'Also, if there was something going on, believe me journalists would be the last to find out.'

Kovacic, who has been watched by Arsenal and Everton in recent months also, has scored eight goals in 34 appearances in all competitions for Inter this season but is out with a knee ligament injury.
