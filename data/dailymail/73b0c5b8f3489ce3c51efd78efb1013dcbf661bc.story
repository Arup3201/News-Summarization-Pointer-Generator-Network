A jubilant class of Air Force Academy cadets have celebrated their graduation, amid a stark warning to 'better their reputation and take on the 'scourge of sexual assaults.

In a message to the new graduates, Air Force Secretary Michael Donley echoed the message President Barack Obama delivered to the Naval Academy last week amid concerns a growing sexual assault epidemic is staining the military.

'Today, the character of our Air Force is being questioned by some,' Donley told more than 1,000 graduates at the U.S. Air Force Academy, in Colorado.

'Our reputation is at risk from irresponsible and even criminal behavior within our ranks.'

Donley noted the graduating cadets were trained in sexual assault prevention, but he said policies aren't enough, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported.

'This is your Air Force, and changing behavior depends on changing at every level the command climate and social culture in which we operate and live, both on and off duty,' he said.

At Annapolis, Md., on Friday, Obama told Naval Academy graduates that people who commit sexual crimes 'threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong.'

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel drew on the same themes at West Point's graduation on Saturday.

'Sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military are a profound betrayal — a profound betrayal — of sacred oaths and sacred trusts,' he said.

The Pentagon released a report this month estimating that as many as 26,000 military members were sexually assaulted last year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward, despite new oversight and assistance programs.

A handful of cadets at the Air Force Academy have faced sexual misconduct or sexual assault cases since January 2012.

About 19,000 assaults were estimated to have occurred in 2011.

The World War II-era planes flown by volunteers filled in for the Air Force Thunderbirds, which were grounded by budget cuts.

Donley decried the budget cuts, saying they are undermining military readiness.
