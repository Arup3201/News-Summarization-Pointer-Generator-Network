If you have ever wondered what happens in the build-up to a Barclays Premier League match, wonder no more.

The process is mapped out with military precision, from the time the line-ups have to be declared to when the coin toss is - to the second - and half-time is EXACTLY 15 minutes.

Queens Park Rangers tweeted a picture of the regulations before their clash with Stoke, giving fans an insight into how their heroes prepare in those crucial minutes prior to a match.

The teams have a half-an-hour warm-up period before heading back to the dressing room 15 minutes before the match.

They must then be in the tunnel six minutes before kick-off, walk on to the pitch two minutes later, face the (Premier League) music a minute later and the referee and captains must toss the coin 80 seconds before the match starts.

The schedule will be even tighter for the QPR-Stoke clash as it is a live televised match on BT Sport.
