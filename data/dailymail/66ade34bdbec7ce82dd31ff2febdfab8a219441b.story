It is not every day you get to see a 66,000-pound US Navy fighter jet zoom over the Golden Gate bridge.

Luckily for amateur Bay Area photographer Rich Shelton, he had his trusty camera at the ready to capture the awe-inspiring sight of a Blue Angels stunt pilot soaring over the span of the iconic San Francisco landmark. 

The gorgeous shot of the No. 5 F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter suspended mid-air high above traffic and pedestrians - and perfectly framed by the unmistakable orange supports of the bridge - was taken earlier this month as the Blue Angels demonstration squadron was preparing for this year's San Francisco Fleet Week.

Location, location, location: Shelton was able to make photos of the jets from a WWII-era bunker next to a toll plaza

Knowing the US Navy and Marine Corp demonstration squadron was going to be doing practice flights on the morning of October 9, Shetlon picked out a perfect spot by a toll plaza overlooking the bridge and trained his camera on the iconic span.

The 55-year-old retiree from Tiburon did not have to wait long before the gleaming fighter jets painted blue and yellow appeared on the horizon, swooping down like graceful steel swallows.

Shelton trained his camera equipped with a full-frame 70-400mm lens on the high-flying spectacle and began snapping away, capturing some two dozen shots of planes flying at top speed over and around the Golden Gate bridge in various formations.

'There's a fair bit of luck involved trying to catch a perfectly centered shot,' Shelton told Aol.com.

Of all the dazzling pictures taken by Shelton that day, however, one stood out from the rest: the crisp, meticulously aligned shot of jet No. 5 piloted by Lt Cmdr. Dave Tickle hanging in mid-air some 400 feet above the span. 

Online phenomenon: Shelton's Blue Angels picture has gone viral on Facebook and Reddit

A US Navy spokeswoman estimated that the F/A-18 Hornet would have been flying at a speed of about 350mph and at an altitude of 600 feet in that moment, making Shelton’s photographic feat all the more impressive.

The Golden Gate Bridge's elevation is 220 feet, and the orange towers standing at both ends of the span rise to a height of 746 feet.

When Mr Shelton, a retired chemical engineer, posted the picture on Facebook, it quickly went viral drawing more than 4,000 'likes' as of Wednesday afternoon.

One of his friends later shared the stunning photo of the plane hovering over the bridge on Reddit, where it has drawn more than a million views.

'It was a calculated but lucky photo, and I'm very happy with it,' he told Aol.com.

When Mr Shelton is not busy taking one-of-a-kind pictures of fighter jets in flight, which could be seen on his Flickr account, he volunteers as a search manager for the Marin County Sheriff Search and Rescue unit.
