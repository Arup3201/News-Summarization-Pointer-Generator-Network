VITAL STATISTICS Before Mustique became the Caribbean playground of the Princess Margaret set in the 1970s, this island in the Grenadines was given over to sugar production. 

Cotton House's main buildings were originally a warehouse and sugar mill before being transformed by theatre designer Oliver Messel. 

Celebrity hangout: The Cotton House in Mustik is a playground for the rich and famous

Cotton House on the island of Mustique, in the Grenadines, boasts 17 sea-view rooms, suites, and cottages

Of the hotel's 17 rooms and suites, the garden cottages are the cheapest (although this is a relative term), while the sea-view rooms, with plunge pools, are the most popular. 

The two-bedroom residence is the most private - with its own butler and a large private swimming pool. 

The Veranda restaurant cements its seriousness with sashimi alongside a world-class wine list; Prince William and Kate regularly eat here on their stays. 

The beach cafe is more family-friendly and Basil's Bar - the least manicured part of Mustique - is where everyone ends up for rum punches and beer. 

Kate Moss limbered up for her 40th birthday celebrations here.

LOCATION REPORT A short hop from Barbados, on an island that mixes classic Caribbean charm (white-sand beaches, palm trees) with about 100 souped-up villas belonging to celebrities, hedge-fund managers and fashion magnates. 

Surrounded by perfect grass lawns, the hotel also houses tennis courts, riding school and a dive centre. A fleet of golf carts get guests around the island.

KEY ATTRACTION This is entry level for Mustique - staying here is a taster before plunging into renting a villa (or, like Mick Jagger and Bryan Adams, buying one). 

Kate's family, the Middletons, stayed here before upgrading to the Aurora villa. 

Recently given a facelift by hotelier Grace Leo, the Cotton House has stayed true to its Caribbean roots with white furniture, overhead fans and a studied informality. 

Homeowners and guests turn up for the weekly drinks parties in the barn-like Great Room, with its squashy sofas and a bar with every spirit known to mankind.

X Factor judge Cheryl Cole tied the knot on Macaroni Beach (pictured) in July

IN THE NEWS X Factor judge Cheryl Cole took on the slightly more unwieldy moniker of Fernandez-Versini when she married on Macaroni Beach in July. 

The spa has recently been given a makeover by cult British brand ila, and its founder Denise Leicester held a retreat here earlier this month.

GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF US? It's never going to be cheap; a pizza at the Beach Cafe is £17 and the food prices rise like a pop star's ego after that. 

Day-trippers are discouraged unless they are set to inherit a nation or two, or frequently grace the covers of the world's glossiest magazines.

GETTING THERE A seven-night break with Virgin Holidays and Hip Hotels (vhiphotels.co.uk, 0844 573 2460) starts at £2,999 per person, including flights and B&B accommodation based on travel in May 2015.
