She was spotted smoking what appeared to be marijuana as she strolled around New York City last month in April.

But now the full extent of Amanda Bynes's troubled world has been revealed after the child star opened up the doors to her Manhattan apartment for an impromptu house party the same month.

Two men, including a photographer by the name of Giovanni Arnold and another who would go only go by the name of 'Joe', claim to In Touch magazine that they witnessed the actress smoke marijuana as she sat on top of a bare mattress in her bedroom.

But Amanda has jumped to her own defense, tweeting on Wednesday night: 'That’s not my bed! Those aren’t my toes! My toes are pedicured!'

apartment for an impromptu house party last month

In the photographs, Amanda's Big Apple abode, which they describe as 'filthy', is littered with rubbish and take-out containers and with windows that have been blacked out with spray paint.

They also claim and presented photographs of what appeared to be empty drug baggies strewn on the floor.

'Weed was everywhere,' Giovanni told the magazine. 'On the bed, all over the floor.'

Erratic: Over the past few weeks, Amanda has continuously displayed erratic behaviour and tweeted bizarre pictures of herself

'She probably gets so high that sometimes she won't even leave her house,' he added.

'One minute she's cool and down-to-earth,' 'Joe' added to the magazine. 'The next, she's totally different - indecisive and she can't hold a conversation. Mentally, she is all over the place.'

In the photographs from In Touch, Amanda is seen sprawled out on her bed, seemingly out of it with a pair of sunglasses covering her eyes.

In one snap she has a half burnt roll up in her mouth and her bare feet are covered in nasty cuts and bruises.

'She'll smoke a joint halfway and then put it out and light a new one. Then she'll relight the half,' 'Joe' told the magazine.

The two men said they witnessed Amanda on several outings with pre-rolled joints and claimed that she had a stockpile of the drug in her apartment.

Giovanni also claims he saw her do cocaine during their time in the apartment.

Past problems: Amanda was photographed in September last year smoking an unknown substance out of a pipe in her BMW whilst she was in Los Angeles

But when questioned by In Touch about the alleged drug use, Amanda strenuously denied the pair's story.

'They're the ones into drugs, so they bring drugs, but I don't do them,' she said.

Isolated: Pals say Amanda has totally isolated herself from her friends and family members

Giovanni and 'Joe' told the magazine that Amanda's living conditions were poor, with her house virtually unfurnished.

'Her living room is basically empty: She has two big purple chairs and a little dining room table, that's it,' 'Joe' said.

The photographer said that while there is one blind on the window, the rest are half spray painted black.

'It's almost like she couldn't bother to get more blinds,' Giovanni said.

During their night at Amanda's, the actress also reportedly obsessed about her weight.

'You can tell that she craves attention, but at the same time, it makes her feel uncomfortable because she is so uncomfortable about her appearance,' 'Joe' told the magazine.

'She talks about losing weight constantly - she's fixated. As weird as she is, she's still very Hollywood: demanding and obsessed with how she looks.'

According to several past reports, Amanda's parents have tried desperately to reach out to their daughter but to no avail.

Close friends say that they fear for the actress who has completely lost touch with the outside world.

Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton, who knew Amanda before she started with her erratic behaviour last year, described the situation as 'frightening'.

'She is a totally different person now,' he told the magazine.

'She's effectively isolated herself from her family, friends and loved ones. Her life must be incredibly lonely, confusing and frightening right now.'
