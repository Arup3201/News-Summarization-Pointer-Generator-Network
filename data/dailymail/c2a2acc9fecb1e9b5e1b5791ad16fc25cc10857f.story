A trainee teacher sent home on her first day at a Catholic school because of her tattoos has abandoned her dream of a career in the classroom. 

Charlotte Tumilty, 26, was turned away from her trainee role at a strict Catholic school when staff took exception to her body art.

The mother-of-two has now decided to quit her place on a teaching training course to care for her family instead.

Charlotte Tumilty, 26, has decided to quit being a teacher after being sent home because of her tattoos

Miss Tumilty had been on a level two teacher training course at Hartlepool College of Further Education

Miss Tumilty, from Hartlepool, said: 'I've quit the college, I have no idea what I will do, to be honest - probably just concentrate on my family.

'Since it's all blown out of proportion, my story has gone global.

'I've had a lot of support, although I have had a fair bit of negative feedback, mainly from the older generation.'

Miss Tumilty had been offered the role at St John Vianney's Primary School in Hartlepool as part of her teacher training course.

She was on a level two teacher training course at Hartlepool College of Further Education and was due to work at the school twice a week for a year.  

Despite passing an earlier interview, within a hour of starting the position she was told to go home and come back with plasters and bandages covering up her 'inappropriate' body art. 

She has a 'full sleeve' of tattoos on her arms and legs, smaller inkings on her fingers, hands, back and chest and an eye emblem on her neck.

But Miss Tumilty said she was unable to cover them all up and there were no other placements available at other schools.

She then faced fresh controversy after erotic photos, some completely nude, appeared on a number of websites.

Miss Tumilty admitted posing for some 'old' pictures when she was aged 18, but has refused to comment further.

Appearing under the name of Charlie Horizon the photos show her in compromising and revealing positions.

In some of the images she can be seen pulling down her trousers to expose her behind, while in many she is completely topless. 

Within an hour of starting her job at St John Vianney's Primary (pictured), she was told to cover up her tattoos

Under current legislation people with tattoos are not covered by the Equality Act 2010.

Earlier this year a business executive was sacked from her job after having an inking of a butterfly design on her foot.

Jo Perkins, 38, had the design on the side of her left foot when she started working for multi-million pound firm Salisbury FM.

But after she started work, bosses brought in a ‘no tattoos on show’ rule – and terminated Miss Perkins’s contract when she could not cover up her inking.

Similarly, Larissa Westcott said she was having a job interview with British Airways when she was told her application wouldn't be taken any further because of a tattoo on her foot.

However, earlier this month, the army announced that it was lifting its ban on hand and neck tattoos in a bid to draw in more recruits.
