Porto cruised into the last eight of the Champions League after a comprehensive victory against Basle at the Estadio do Dragao on Tuesday night.

The teams drew 1-1 in Switzerland three weeks ago but goals by Yacine Brahimi, Miguel Herrera, Casemiro and Vincent Aboubakar settled the tie to send the Portuguese side into their first quarter-final since 2009.

The one sour note on an otherwise perfect night for Porto was that captain Danilo had to be carried off on a stretcher with his neck in a brace, but it was later confirmed he had suffered no serious injury.

Basle were reduced to 10 men in injury time after experienced defender Walter Samuel was dismissed for a second bookable offence for an off-the-ball incident with Aboubakar.

Algerian midfielder Brahimi opened the scoring for the home side in the 14th minute with a superbly executed free kick after on-loan Barcelona forward Cristian Tello was clumsily felled right on the edge of the penalty area by former Inter Milan defender Samuel.

Brahimi placed the ball with purpose before the 25-year-old sent a bending effort over the wall and into the top corner, leaving Basle goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik rooted to the spot.

Porto were then dealt a major blow as captain and Real Madrid  target Danilo was involved in a sickening collision with his own keeper Fabiano.

The clash left both men in a heap but it was the Brazilian right back that came off worst. Danilo crashed to the floor, visibly knocked following contact with Fabiano's shoulder.

The 23-year-old left the field on a stretcher with his neck in a brace before being placed in an ambulance and taken to hospital, where tests revealed no lasting damage.

After a lengthy stoppage in play Porto could have added to their lead in the first half as the Portuguese side controlled the game. First Casmeiro and then Aboubakar went close as the home side had to settle for a one-goal lead at half-time.

But Porto did extend their advantage just minutes after the restart. Goalscorer Brahimi turned provider this time as he teed up Hector Herrera after a fine run down the left flank.

Brahimi twisted and turned before cutting back to the Mexican on the edge of the area, who beat Vaclik with a perfectly placed curling effort from 18 yards.

It got even better for Porto as on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro produced a stunning free kick, a cut above even  his team-mate's in the opening 45.

The 23-year-old struck a dipping effort from more than 30 yards that left poor old Vaclik picking the ball out the net again to put the tie beyond any doubt.

The fourth goal, coming with 15 minutes to play, was just as good as the three that preceded it. Basle defenders backed off  Aboubakar as he marauded forward before the Cameroon international unleashed a ferocious strike from 20 yards that nestled in the top corner.

Frustration boiled over for Samuel in the final moments of the match as he was involved in an altercation with Aboubakar off the ball. The Argentine defender was shown a second yellow card for his troubles as Porto marched into the last eight.

Vincent Aboubakar completed the scoring with another brilliant strike from 20 yards to make it 5-1 overall
