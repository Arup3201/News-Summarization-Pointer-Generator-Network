It's fabulously cheap swimwear. The only downside? They might go see through. 

Some K-Mart pink and white striped cossies which 'may go transparent' in the water were today named among the 'winners' of the awards no company wants to receive.

Consumer group Choice's 'Shonky Awards' listed the swimmers alongside some of this year's most egregious product fails.  

And for the wronged fans of Thermomix, a popular kitchen appliance, it was the moment they finally extracted their revenge. 

These K-Mart bathers may appear to cheap and stylish, however...

... The tag says 'some garments may be transparent when wet' and should 'avoid excessive contact with suntan lotions, oils, rough surfaces, heated pools and spas treated with harsh chemicals'

Manufacturers of the mixer - which has an almost cult-like following - came under attack in September after they released an expensive new model without giving their loyal customers any warning.

Many customers who had recently purchased the old TM31 model told Daily Mail Australia they felt tricked by the surprise release of the first mixer in seven years. 

Georgina Shelley from Brisbane started a petition on Change.org, writing: 'Many like myself, asked the question before purchasing, if there was a new Thermomix on the way. 

'My consultant told me that she hadn't heard anything about it.' 

Thermomix today received a Shonky award after Choice was deluged with more than 530 nominations.

To make things sweeter for the so-called 'Thermo Fans', Choice has referred the company to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.

Even one of Australia's favourite brands, Arnott's, found itself a recipient of a Shonky. 

Earlier this year, the company released a new line of Tim Tams with a distinct peanut butter flavour. It was a mouthwatering prospect for many fans. 

But the consumer group today revealed that while there was one unusual ingredient included - paprika, a condiment - there were no peanuts. 

Missing something? Arnotts won themselves a Shonky award by failing to include an important ingredient - peanuts - in their peanut butter flavoured Tim Tams

That wasn't the only way consumers had been wronged. Choice also said consumers had been fobbed off, given Arnotts kept the same packaging but removed two biscuits from their usual serving.

The Commonwealth Bank, BankWest, S-26 Gold Toddler and Junior and Amazon were also among the recipients.  

In a statement, CHOICE CEO Alan Kirkland said he hoped the Shonky awards would force businesses to clean up their act.

'The risk of receiving an infamous Shonky encourages businesses to sharpen up their act and put consumers first,' he said.
