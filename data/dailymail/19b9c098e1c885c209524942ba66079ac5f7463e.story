They were billed as Westminster's unlikeliest couple when they were pictured travelling around London together last summer.

And now William Hague and Angelina Jolie are back together again as they opened a research centre at the London School of Economics today.

The 36-year-old actress founded a campaign to end violence against women in conflict zones with the then-Foreign Secretary in 2012, and was back in London to help promote it.

The new research centre will study the participation of women in conflict and on ending impunity for rape and sexual violence in war.

The Hollywood A-lister, who is best known for her roles in Salt and Mr and Mrs Smith, said: 'There is no stable future for a world in which crimes committed against women go unpunished.'

Ms Jolie, who is married to fellow actor Brad Pitt, was last in London in June last year to host a global summit on violence against women in war.

Dubbed End Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms Jolie spent days touring the capital with the ever-attentive Mr Hague in pursuit, before the summit began on June 10.

UN Secretary Ban Ki Moon and US Secretary of State John Kerry both attended, along with delegates and youth delegates from more than 100 countries.

Mr Hague and David Cameron were ribbed during her last visit for behaving like schoolboys as they met her outside Downing Street.

While Mr Hague did appear rather starstruck on that occasion  he has actually visited warzones with her on several occasions prior to that.

As well as acting and directing, including recent blockbuster Unbroken, Ms Jolie is also a UN Special Envoy for Refugees. 

The mother-of-six began visiting refugee camps in 2000 after travelling to Cambodia to film Tomb Raider, becoming a Goodwill Ambassador and taking on 40 such trips.
