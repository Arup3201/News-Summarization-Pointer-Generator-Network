An American adventurer and environmental activist has spoken of how he managed to stay clean - despite not showering for an entire year.

Rob Greenfield, 27, has spent the last year bathing only in natural water resources such as rivers, lakes, waterfalls and in the rain.

When natural water was not available, he would go in search of fire hydrants and leaking taps.

However, if there was no natural source of water available, Mr Greenfield would have to go in search of fire hydrants and leaking taps. He is pictured here bathing by a leaking fire hydrant in Brooklyn, New York

The idea for the project came to Mr Greenfield while he was cycling across America to promote sustainability and eco-friendly living.

Mr Greenfield, who lives in San Diego in California, initially planned to go shower-free for 100 days during his bike ride, but once he was done cycling, he extended the time period - first to six months and then a year.

The average American consumes around 100 gallons of water a day, but Mr Greenfield said on average he used around two gallons a day for the entire year.

Mr Greenfield, whose activism and outlook on life have gained him tens of thousands of social media followers, said that he hopes to encourage people to live happier and healthier lifestyles.

The adventurer, who once ate only dumpster meals for a week to build awareness of food waste, runs an environmentally active marketing company called The Greenfield Group in San Diego.

He said: 'For the entire bike ride I had committed to not taking a shower and instead just swimming in lakes and rivers when I came across them.

'Once the tour was over I decided to keep on going. My mission is to inspire people to start paying attention to their surroundings and to be conscious of how their simple actions affect the world around them.

'When we over consume water, we waste electricity, use extra chemicals used to treat the water, increase pollution and put a strain on the sources where our water comes from.

'For doing the challenge, I got a lot of marriage proposals, excitement, smiles, and high fives.

'Of course, I get plenty of comments but that really is just a lack of understanding because I really have proved to myself and others that it's possible to stay clean while living a natural lifestyle and certainly a lot healthier than eating junk food and covering our bodies with cosmetics that are full of chemicals.'
