A man who took up an offer from two strangers in the street to smoke marijuana later had his clothes stolen by them after being assaulted, police in San Francisco said.

The victim’s ordeal began in the early hours of Thursday morning when he was asked by two men in the Nob Hill area of the city to smoke marijuana with them.

The 35-year-old Californian agreed and they walked to an apartment, or possibly a hotel room, in the 2000 block of Polk Street, according to local media.

Quoting a police source, nbcdfw.com said that after arriving in the room the victim took his jacket and pants off, having become too warm.

After visiting the bathroom, the victim was punched in the face by the two suspects, who then took his cellphone, wallet and clothing, the site said.

Police were called to the scene at 3.45am. The victim refused medical treatment for minor bruising to his cheek.

He described his attackers as black, between 25 and 35 years old, with one dressed in a hoodie and dark jeans, the other wearing dark clothes.

It follows news that a year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, sales hit nearly $700million.

In its first annual report, it was revealed that 49.7 tons (109,578 pounds) of medical marijuana flowers were sold in 2014, while 17.5 tons (38,660 pounds) were sold in the retail market, said the Colorado Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division.

Sales hit nearly $700 million last year, with medical marijuana accounting for $386million and recreational pot bringing in $313million.

But recreational sales of pot-infused edible products, such as candies and cookies, outstripped medical sales by about 2.85million units to 1.96million, according to the report.

In total, 4.81million units of edible marijuana were sold - which would equal giving one edible to almost every resident in Colorado, according to 9News.

A year after retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado, 17 tons of the recreational buds were bought by consumer (above Tyler Williams of Blanchester, Ohio selects marijuana strains from the 3-D Denver Discrete Dispensary in December 2014)
