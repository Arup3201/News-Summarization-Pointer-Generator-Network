Peter Thompson, 48, struck the behind of stewardess Agnieszla Kowalczyk during a Ryanair flight from Alicante but said it was an accident

A bridegroom has been spared prison after he drunkenly struck the bottom of an air hostess while he was flying home from his stag night.

Peter Thompson, 48, allegedly struck the behind of stewardess Agnieszla Kowalczyk during a Ryanair flight from Alicante, in Spain.

She told Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court that Thompson told her she 
was very pretty, that he loved her and that he had looked at her as if 
she was a ‘piece of meat.’

But he claimed he had accidentally hit Miss Kowalczyk while swinging his arms around in a drunken manner.

When the plane arrived at Bournemouth Airport, Dorset, Thompson - a languages teacher - was arrested.

He pleaded guilty to common assault on the basis that it was an accident, and he also admitted being drunk on an aircraft.

Thompson, a teacher at a private language school from Poole, was let off with a community service order.

The court heard Thompson, who is due to get married in August, was flying home from his stag do in Alicante, Spain, when the incident happened on May 4.

At a previous court hearing, Lee Turner, prosecuting read a statement from the air stewardess.

Mr Turner said: 'As she walked past he smacked her bottom with his open right hand. He wasn’t aggressive, she thinks he was trying to be funny but was actually very disrespectful.'

But James Moore, defending, said that the offence had been an accident on Thompson’s part.

He said his client had consumed an anti-histamine tablet and alcohol before the flight.

He was also sold a discounted alcoholic drink by the air stewardess on the plane.

Mr Moore said Thompson was in high spirits and was looking forward to seeing his fiancee when the incident happened.

He said: 'He should have known that had he swung his arms around he was likely to make contact, and contact he made.

'He has an exuberant and bubbly personality and he got himself carried away but it was in no way nasty.

'Because he was in drink this offence has taken place.

'He
 is a kind person who is truly remorseful for the fact that he has 
appeared before the court and for the fact that he has caused the air 
stewardess any distress.

'It was not his intention to cause her distress.'

During the hearing Thompson’s fiancee gave a witness statement in support of his character.

The air hostess told Bournemouth Magistrates' Court that Thompson told her she was very pretty and that he loved her and that he looked at her as if she was a 'piece of meat'

He was also supported by statements by his brother, a former police officer, and the boss of the charity organisation at which he volunteers.

District Judge Stephen Nicholls sentenced Thompson to a 12 month community order, 120 hours of unpaid work, and fines totalling £245.

He said: 'You accept that when you went on the aircraft you had been drinking and that you were reckless and struck the flight attendant.

'Any offence in an aircraft is clearly an aggravated feature.

'Everybody on that aircraft has no easy means of escape therefore any incident that takes place there is a concern of upsetting the staff and passengers.

'This behaviour is out of character for you.'
