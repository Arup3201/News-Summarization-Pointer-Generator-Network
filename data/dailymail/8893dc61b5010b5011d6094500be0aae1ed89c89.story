Moustachioed: Middle-Eastern men are increasingly seeking moustache implants as they are associated with wisdom and maturity. Role models, such as Turkish singer Ibrahim Tatlises, above, are thought to have encouraged the boom

For many men, the constant struggle to tame their facial hair with a razor is something of a nuisance.

But an increasing number of men in Middle Eastern countries are seeking innovative ways of achieving a hairier upper lip, with a boom in moustache implants.

The innovative treatment is proving popular with men from in the Arab world, where moustaches are seen to convey wisdom and maturity.

One plastic surgeon based in Turkey said that patients are flocking from Middle Eastern countries to receive the treatment.

Selahattin Tulunay said that he performs the procedure, known as follicular unit extraction, between 50 to 60 times every month.

The intricate procedure involves the surgeon taking a clump of hairs from areas of more dense growth, before they are implanted in the moustache area.

Explaining the surge in recent years of Middle Eastern men travelling to receive the treatment, Dr Tulunay said: 'For some men who look young and junior, 
they think (a mustache) is a must to look senior...more professional 
and wise. They think it is prestigious.'

The treatment, which is performed under local anesthetic, costs up to $7000 (£4370) and requires the subject to abstain from shaving for fifteen days.

The transplant is expected to produce results after six months.

Dr Tulunay told CNN that celebrities, such as hirsute Turkish singer and actor Ibrahim Tatlises, often act as 'role models' for those seeking the treatment.

The surgeon also revealed that he had performed the procedure on politicians who wanted a moustache to boost their image.

The moustache is commonplace in the highest echelons of Middle Eastern politics, with many politicians seeing the facial hair as conferring power, wisdom and nobility.

All of Iraq's leaders, including Saddam Hussein, have sported a moustache.

Current high-profile politicians in the Middle East, such as Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, rarely appear in public without a finely coiffed moustache.

Moustaches are also known to symbolise personal honour in the Arab world, with several reported cases of people removing their opponent's moustaches to disgrace them.

One of Saddam Hussein's former senior aides, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, once roared 'Curse be upon your mustache!' at a Kuwaiti politician during an emergency 
summit of Islamic states in 2003.

Paris-based surgeon Pierre Bouhanna told CNN that his business had boomed over the last five years.

Mr Bouhanna said most of his patients travelled to France from Iran, Lebanon, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Turkey. 

He said most patients were aged between 30 and 50, adding: 'My impression is more and more they want to establish their male aspect. They want a strong mustache.'
