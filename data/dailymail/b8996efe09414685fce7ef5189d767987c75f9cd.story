A stunning pre-war Rolls-Royce that
belonged to Lord Louis Mountbatten is to be sold at auction - at a 
starting price of £50,000.

Lord
Mountbatten, a second cousin of the Queen, was one of Britain’s great 
naval officers and the 1929 Rolls-Royce is painted in battleship grey to honour his Navy career.

The 
Phantom II Sedanca de Ville harks back to the golden age of motoring and
still bears Lord Mountbatten's initial on its British registration 
plate LM3698.

The 7.7 litre, six cylinder Roller with its body work built by the great coachbuilders Barker, stands out as a triumph of the British motor industry

The stylish luxury vehicle was delivered new to the long-serving Royal in February 1930 and he would have been driven around in it by his chauffeur, who was exposed to the elements as the front 
part of the car had no roof.

The
7.7 litre, six cylinder Roller with its body work built by the great 
coachbuilders Barker, stands out as a triumph of the British motor 
industry.

In more recent years it has been kept in the Aalholm Collection as part of the renowned Aalholm Automobil Museum in Denmark.

The classic car is one of nearly 100 automobiles being sold at auction following the closure of the museum in 2007.

And with its links to the Royal family, it is sure to be keenly fought over by collectors at the sale.

In its catalogue description, 
auctioneers RM Auctions state: 'Chassis 133WJ is paired with a Sedanca 
de Ville body and a special dashboard with raised grille and bonnet to 
match.

'It was delivered new
on February 24, 1930 to the Rt. Honourable Lord Louis Mountbatten, a 
British statesman, Naval officer, and an uncle to Prince Philip, Duke of
Edinburgh.

'As presented, it exhibits only minor flaws: some bubbling around the bonnet hinge and slight settling of the driver’s door.

'The upholstery is all in good condition and the undercarriage is sound, but the engine compartment could use detailing.

'It is also fitted with twin 
pillar-mounted spot lamps. Understated in grey and black, it bears 
British registration LM3698, clearly a cherished number since its issue 
pre-dates the car’s manufacture.

'Body-colour wheel discs complement the formal appearance, although lacking on the side-mount spares.

'Not shy of appearance as is, it would benefit from either minor detailing or a complete restoration.'

Lord Mountbatten was the last Viceroy of India as well as the first Governor-General of the independent India.

In the First World War he fought as a midshipman and during the Second World War rose to Supreme Allied Commander of the Southeast Asia Theatre.

From 1954 until 1959 he was the First Sea Lord and afterwards became chief of the defence staff until 1965, making him the longest-serving professional head of the British Armed Forces.

He was murdered by the IRA in 1979 after a bomb was planted on his yacht off the north west coast of Ireland.

Nicholas Knatchbuill, his 14-year-old grandson, was also killed along with a 15-year-old local crew member and the 83-year-old Dowager Lady Brabourne.

The auction takes place in Denmark this Sunday.
