Two Gold Coast women who attacked an elderly, vision-impaired man on a bus while dressed in their colourful frocks from a day at the races will be sentenced today.

Layni Cameron, 17, and Larna Watmough, 21, were charged with seriously assaulting 77-year-old Paul Buttigieg on a bus in the suburb of Kirra in February.

Lawyers for the two women told the Southport Magistrates Court earlier this year the pair would plead guilty to the attack, which was captured on video by other passengers on the bus.

The pair handed themselves in to police after footage of the incident, recorded by a 13-year-old passenger, went viral and was passed on to authorities.

The footage showed two women punching, kicking and spitting at an elderly man while hurling insults.

The vision-impaired man's glasses were broken during the incident.

The mobile phone vision captured one of the women attacking the man as he cowered against the window.

The elderly man stood up and one point and attempted to fight back but was quickly pushed back into his seat.

Onlookers yelled for the women to stop and 'leave the poor man alone', before another male passenger eventually stepped in and forced the offenders off the bus.

It is believed both women had attended a racing event earlier in the day before catching the bus home from the Tweed Heads Bowls Club.

It was alleged the women hurled racial comments about Mr Buttigieg's Aboriginal heritage during the attack.

The footage also showed the women verbally abusing a woman with a pram.
