Watching
 my five-year-old son Alex playing with my nine-month-old daughter 
Adriana on her play mat, I sometimes have to pinch myself. Most mothers 
think of their offspring as little miracles - but mine really are.

For
 had I become pregnant with them while living in Britain, I don't think 
my children would be here now - in fact, I might have still been 
childless.

It's a bold statement, but one I feel is justified by my 
experience. I became pregnant with Alex when my husband Cornel and I 
were living in Venice - I'd previously suffered two early miscarriages. 
The first was in 2004 in England, when I was nine weeks pregnant. I'd 
hoped it was just 'one of those things'. I was only 26 at the time and 
had conceived easily.

But when I had a second one four years afterwards at just six weeks, I began to worry. Was there something wrong with me?

This
 time around, I was living in Italy as Cornel, now 34, was working there
 as a pianist. My doctor in Venice suggested there might be underlying 
problems, but told me to wait a while and try again.

Then I became 
pregnant for a third time. But just days after a positive pregnancy 
test, when I was five weeks' pregnant, I started bleeding very heavily.

Like
 all women who've had more than one loss, I knew the telltale signs of 
miscarriage all too well: painful cramping in the stomach, heavy blood 
loss and an intuitive sense of doom. And, as I felt myself lose my third
 baby, a flicker of fight came over me.

'Go to my doctor, please,' I begged Cornel. 'See if there's anything he can give me.'

I didn't dare move from my bed - terrified that if I did, the worst would happen.

Cornel
 rushed off to the hospital where my doctor worked. An hour later, he 
came back clutching a paper bag from the pharmacy. I asked him what it 
was.

It was the hormone progesterone. I'd read about progesterone and
 knew it was important to help women conceive. Many doctors even call it
 'the pregnancy hormone' - so important is it to sustaining a pregnancy.

I'd
 also read a deficiency in it could lead to problems: progesterone 
causes the lining of the womb to thicken to prepare a supportive 
environment for a fertilised egg.

Without it, the lining can 
sometimes not be sufficiently thick for the embryo to implant and be 
sustained. I had no idea if I was deficient in progesterone or not. But 
something told me to give this pregnancy every chance.

So I had the 
medication (it came in pessary form) and lay on the bed for a few hours.
 I got up terrified of what I'd find, but the bleeding    had stopped.

Next
 day, despite my spending a sleepless night worrying, the bleeding 
didn't start again. A few days later I saw my doctor, who told me to 
keep taking the pessaries.

For the first 12 weeks of pregnancy I 
carried on taking the progesterone daily and, sure enough, I had no 
further bleeding. I'd read on the internet that some women said they 
felt side-effects from the treatment such as tiredness, but I had none.

At my 12-week scan, I didn't dare believe all was well, but it was - on screen a tiny, healthy little foetus was bobbing about.

At
 about 13 weeks, I weaned myself off the progesterone. I was petrified, 
like a junkie giving up a drug. My doctor told me there was no danger if
 I stopped suddenly - reassuring me that, by 12 weeks, the placenta took
 over the production of hormones necessary to sustain pregnancy.

But
 when he saw how nervous I was, he suggested I take one every other day 
instead, until I ran out. I still worried that if I stopped I'd bleed 
and lose the baby. But I didn't. I had no more bleeding and, at 38 
weeks, I went into labour naturally and gave birth to Alex.

I was 
thrilled to be a mother, but when we moved back to the UK about ten 
months later, I spoke to other mums who'd suffered early miscarriage. I 
told them about the progesterone I'd been given in Italy and their eyes 
widened.

'You have to jump through so many hoops to get it here,' 
they all told me. I looked into it. I read that in Italy, as in many 
other European countries such as France, progesterone is given out far 
more freely than in the UK - indeed, progesterone is among the most 
commonly used drugs in pregnancy in France and in Italy, with almost a 
third of women at risk of miscarriage being prescribed it.

While 
there are no official figures on the hormone's use in the UK, 'from 
experience it seems there are higher rates of progesterone prescribing 
in Europe', says Professor Ellis Downes, a consultant obstetrician and 
gynaecologist at The Portland Hospital for Women and Children in London.

This
 is despite the fact that in Italy, for instance, the official approach 
is similar to the UK, with progesterone only given to women who've had 
'recurrent' miscarriage - usually taken as three or more losses.

While
 in the UK it appears that women need to try harder to get it, even if 
they fit this criteria, in Italy doctors are more likely to give it to 
women to try as they don't think it can hurt - even in some cases before
 they have suffered three miscarriages.

I'd had two losses, but my 
Italian doctor thought it was better to try something - ie, give me 
progesterone - than do  nothing. Five years after Alex was born, I was 
pregnant again.

Happily, we were back in Italy where my husband was 
again working. When I saw my doctor - a new one this time - and told her
 of my previous losses, she didn't question my belief that progesterone 
had saved Alex. Without even sending me for tests to see if my 
progesterone levels were low, she scribbled something on a prescription 
and sent me off to the pharmacy.

Again, I took the hormone for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Nine months later I had a healthy baby - Adriana.

I
 will never know if progesterone helped me stay pregnant or if those 
first early pregnancies were doomed to fail anyway. Maybe I never was 
progesterone-deficient. No one ever tested my levels, so who knows?

But
 I think that even if the progesterone did not help me, it helped me 
believe I had a safety net; which no doubt helped me keep a positive 
attitude - something all too important after a miscarriage. So why is progesterone not so freely given in the UK? Should women who've suffered recurrent miscarriage have the option?

Professor
 Downes believes the hormone can be helpful, and describes himself as 'a
 fan of giving women progesterone because it's perfectly safe and is a 
helpful thing to give to women who've had miscarriages before'.

'Progesterone
 is a smooth muscle relaxant and it's a very important part of 
pregnancy. Some women are deficient and the medical logic is it makes 
sense to give it to them. We don't fully understand why some women are 
deficient in progesterone - there seems to be a wide variation in the 
“normal” level of progesterone needed in early pregnancy - but there is a
 lot of ongoing research to try to identify why some women have higher 
levels than others.'

Opinion here is divided over the benefits of 
progesterone. Ruth Bender-Atik, national director of the Miscarriage 
Association, says there is a lack of evidence it helps: 'What's more, we
 don't know if there are any disadvantages to using it.'

Professor Downes says there is 'conflicting evidence over whether progesterone works or not'. 'What's
 difficult is, if you give progesterone to a woman who has miscarried 
and she doesn't miscarry, you ask is it due to the progesterone or 
something else?'

The good news is that a major trial involving more 
than 800 women in Britain and the Netherlands could help settle the 
question of whether women who've miscarried should be given 
progesterone.

The hope is the study will show clinicians that 
progesterone does make a difference, and encourage them to give it out 
as a result. In the trial, which started in 2010, women who've had three
 recurrent miscarriages or more are given progesterone or a placebo in 
the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The results will be published this 
October.

Would I have gone on to carry a pregnancy successfully 
without progesterone? NHS figures suggest about 20 per cent of 
pregnancies miscarry in the first three months and many women who lose 
these babies do go on to have successful subsequent pregnancies.

Maybe,
 I might have been one of those fortunate women. But it's hard not to 
believe that progesterone saved Alex and Adriana. I just hope other 
women are given the chance I was.
