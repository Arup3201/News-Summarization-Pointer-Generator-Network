A mother who narrowly avoided death  has described how her body got 'super hot and it hurt like hell' when she was nearly hit by a bolt of lightning during a thunderstorm.

Stephanie Rey, 46, has said she now feels 'extremely lucky to be alive' after her phone was sent flying 10ft from her hand after she heard a huge bang while she was filming the thunderstorm.

Her daughter, Carolanne Weske, 21, who was visiting Hayden, in Idaho, from California, managed to capture the moment on camera.

Ms Rey said her 'arms and legs were tingling for around six hours' after the lightning struck in Idaho

Office manager Ms Rey said: 'I can't be 100 per cent sure that I was struck by lightning it all happened so fast.

'All I know is that my body got super hot and it hurt like hell - my arms and legs were tingling for around six hours.

'After it all happened I thought that it could have killed me - I feel extremely lucky to be alive, I'm so glad I wasn't electrocuted in front of my daughter.

'My phone flew about ten feet from my hands, I didn't throw it.'

Ms Weske, who works as a model and video editor, had been filming the storms on the afternoon of August 19 when the lightning struck.

She said: 'I was just out there filming the incredible lightning, I was laid down staring up, my mom came out to see if I was OK and when she noticed me lying there she went in to get her phone to take a picture.

'Then it hit, we didn't know what had happened we both just ran inside and we were laughing, then crying - it was really shocking.

'My mom was like "oh my god - I think I have just been struck by lightning." I asked her if she needed to go to the hospital, we were both in shock.

'When something happens so fast it doesn't give you time to be that scared, it's not like a natural disaster, you can't see it building up - it just happened in the blink of an eye and it was gone.'

The lightning strike destroyed both of their phones but  Ms Weske has said it won't be putting her off from being outdoors the next time a storm hits. 

'It was an experience I will never forget - very few people get to experience something so powerful and be so close to mother nature like that, added the 21-year-old.

'It sounds crazy but I would like to experience something similar again - it was so incredible and so powerful and I will never forget it for the rest of my life.'
