Stefanie Thomas and her husband Paul are never likely to forget each other's birthdays; they both fall on September 6.

Now their first child, Oliver, has completed the hat-trick, arriving on Tuesday – September 6 – at 11.03pm.

His birth defies odds of 133,225-1 and his mother said: 'I wish we had known because we would have gone to the bookies and put a bet on!'

A date to remember: Mr and Mrs Thomas with baby Oliver

Cute: Mrs Thomas said the tot, who weighed 8lbs 2oz, was 'the best birthday present ever'

Mr Thomas added: 'It's quite convenient because I now only have to remember one date for all of us. We never imagined it could happen but as the days approached it seemed more and more likely.'

Oliver had been due on Monday, August 29. Mrs Thomas, a support worker for Devon and Cornwall Police, began to feel 'twinges' on the Sunday and, after several false starts, went into hospital at 1.30pm on Tuesday.

The baby was born on what was Mrs Thomas's 26th birthday and her husband's 28th.

'It is the best birthday present ever,' said Mrs Thomas, from Plymouth.

'Lots of our friends joked about the baby being born on our birthday, but we didn't think it would actually happen.'

Mr Thomas, a primary school teacher, said: 'We didn't open our birthday cards until two days later. The birthday celebration was lost in the excitement of the birth.'

Maths expert Dr John Eales, of Plymouth University, said: 'The chances of a couple and their first born child sharing the same birthday are very slim – approximately one in 133,225 or 0.0000075.'
