This is the dramatic moment a hooded mugger dragged a woman along a road as she desperately clung on to her handbag.

CCTV footage shows how heroin addict Ryan Barber, 25, ambushed his victim from behind, forced her down and pulled her 15 feet along the ground.

He eventually managed to snatch the bag, containing £300, and fled the scene, leaving his 61-year-old victim suffering two broken fingers.

The woman, who has not been identified, was said to be 'extremely shaken' by the attack, which happened in Blackpool, Lancashire.

Barber was today jailed for three years after he admitted robbery and possessing heroin.

He carried out the attack after begging friends to loan him some money so he could buy drugs, Preston Crown Court was told.

The woman was walking along Raikes Parade, Blackpool, at about 2.45pm on June 22 when Barber crept up behind her and pounced.

He took hold of her handbag strap and pulled her to the floor before dragging her along the pavement, across the road and into a parked car.

After fleeing with the bag, Barber went to a flat in the town and showed friends a wad of notes, telling them he had robbed a man and woman.

When police raided the property five days after the attack, they found Barber had locked himself in the bathroom.

He was trying to inject himself with heroin as officers forced their way in.

Barber's lawyer, Sarah Booth, told the court that he had written a letter of apology to his victim.

She said: 'This offence is a new low for him. He says he finds it extremely difficult to accept what he has done to this lady, being dragged along the ground.

'He is extremely embarrassed and ashamed of it. He wishes he could change what he did.

'At the time he was using significant amounts of heroin, methadone, crack cocaine, cannabis and anything else.

'His life was literally dropping off the edge'.

But Judge Andrew Woolman, passing sentence, told Barber: 'It was a determined robbery.

'I accept you are remorseful and you now realise how low you have sunk as a result of your long-standing addiction.

'But there has to be a prison sentence. I could not possibly justify anything else.

'The public have to know those who commit offences of robbery in the street will receive immediate sentences of imprisonment.'

At the time of the mugging, Det Insp Becky Smith, of Lancashire Police, said: 'This was a particularly brutal robbery which has understandably left the victim both shocked and traumatised by her ordeal.'
