Underwear tycoon Michelle Mone is embroiled in a bitter row over plans to turn the house next door to her £1 million home into student digs.

The Ultimo boss is fighting Strathclyde University's proposals to use the property for accommodation and functions and says she doesn't want 'anti-social' neighbours. 

Self-made multi-millionaire Mone bought the converted property off-plan in Glasgow's upmarket Park Circus area last year after splitting from her husband Michael.

She paid £780,700 for the three-bedroom duplex and had extensive works done before moving into it last August. The property has a magnificent reception hall and stairway and is now worth more than £1 million.

She opened the doors of the home for a photoshoot with Hello magazine and described it as her 'new beginning'.

However, the 42-year-old businesswoman was aghast at the thought of 'anti-social' university students becoming her neighbours or attending events at the house.

In a strongly-worded letter to planning officials at Glasgow City Council, she said: 'I am replying to strongly object to this application.

'Having looked at the plans, I object as I having paid in the region of £1 million for my home, I do not under any circumstances want the adjacent property being used by or for university students.

'I would also like to object on the grounds of potential for anti-social behaviour which, despite the best intentions, cannot be avoided where student accommodation is concerned.

'I believe university students to be unsuitable tenants for this area, and would result in a loss of amenity and could also have an adverse impact on the conservation area.'

Despite Mone’s concerns, the university has previously said the house’s living accommodation will mainly be used by its principal Sir Jim McDonald and not by students.

However, it will be used to host corporate events and business engagements. Mone said this would impinge on her privacy and cause traffic problems in an area where parking is 'virtually impossible'.

She added: 'I value my privacy and believe that an increased flow of traffic in the area as a result of this dwelling and its outlined function would eliminate this privacy, which is one of the main reasons I purchased a home in this area in the first place.

'Also, with this new dwelling there will be a large increase in the number of people and, therefore, vehicles associated with that.

Glasgow City Council are due to make a decision on the planning application later this month

'The proposed exit and entrance route to the flats is already overcrowded with vehicles and parking is virtually impossible as it is.'

Mone, who is the only person who has objected to the plans, finished her letter by stating: 'I imagine you will receive many similar objections from other residents living nearby and I trust you will refuse this application on the basis that they most definitely are not in keeping with planning regulations in this area.'

The university’s application states it wants to use the building as a 'university residence with guest accommodation and associated university function use'.

Bosses at the institution were criticised when it emerged they had spent around £1 million buying the five-storey townhouse last year at a time of public spending restraint.

In her shoot with Hello, Mone showed off her home’s spiral staircase, luxurious bedroom suite and grand piano.

She said: 'I work away a lot and I love coming home to it. It’s very special.'

In 2010, Mone was at the centre of a row with neighbours over plans to extend her former family home in Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire.

Five residents objected to her proposals to add a sauna, gym and bar to the six-bedroomed property.

One said the development would 'completely dwarf' the rest of the street but it was given the go-ahead by planners.

A spokesman Strathclyde University said: 'This is a matter for the planning authority.'

Glasgow City Council are due to make a decision on the planning application later this month.
