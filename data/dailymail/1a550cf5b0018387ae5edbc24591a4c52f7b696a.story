According to those in Holland, Louis van Gaal has never looked so relaxed. In his home country, meanwhile, his popularity is soaring.

This is what good results do, of course. Ten goals in three World Cup games ahead of today’s quarter-final have seen Van Gaal’s team play a central and starring role in the narrative of this tournament.

Those players at Manchester United who think that everything will be straight forward under their incoming manager may wish to pause a second, though.

Embrace: Louis van Gaal puts an arm around his captain Robin van Persie

As he outlined frankly when questioned by English journalists here yesterday, players must learn to work closely with him if they are to prosper.

‘I don’t think anything is possible without it,’ said Van Gaal, when asked about the importance of unity. ‘I don’t think we can achieve anything without harmony between players and staff.

‘We have this harmony here. All players and staff create harmony and all players and staff are convinced we can progress as far as possible.

'I’m a person who enjoys harmony. If people make it impossible then it becomes a problem.

‘The players have to pull it off. I’m just a means to an end, no more than that. The players have to do it.

'They are open minded — a fantastic group — the atmosphere is marvellous and everyone works for the best. That’s what I’m most proud of, making 23 players into a cohesive team.’

The issue is relevant to Van Gaal in his present role because of problems Holland have had in the past.

It will be relevant next season at Old Trafford, of course, because his predecessor, David Moyes, was undone by a group of players he simply could not see eye to eye with. Van Gaal has a reputation for abrasiveness.

There will be some small battles to be fought at United.

It is, however, a much more relaxed Van Gaal who is leading Holland through this tournament.

In his home country, he has not always been universally popular. There has been disquiet over the fact that he has spent so many of his coaching years outside of Holland, while his decision to play three central defenders going in to this tournament has been viewed by some as unduly negative.

Anyone who has seen Holland play in Brazil, however, will find it hard to agree.

Cooling off: The team stop for a drink in the scorching conditions of Fortaleza

It was the Dutch who kicked things off here with their 5-1 rout of Spain on day two and, though  defensive deficiencies remain, they have reason to be confident that an attack, buoyed by the prime form of Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie, can continue to function.

Here in Fortaleza yesterday, news was conveyed to Van Gaal of a popularity that is, by all accounts, now going through the roof. ‘I’m not getting all this news,’ he said, smiling.

‘I understand there has been a turnaround, people have changed minds. I’m really pleased this World Cup came at the right time.

‘And yes, this is a new system [3-5-2] but it’s incredibly clever that you can play this formation within three weeks.

'We are used to playing different systems and we have players from foreign competitions that only started with it a few weeks prior to the championships.

'But there is no mountain too high. We showed that in the [2-0 Group B] victory against Chile.’

Van Gaal welcomes back his captain Van Persie today after he served a one-game suspension in their final group match.

And he admitted that he was worried about the heat but would appear to have little concern about the threat posed by today’s opposition.

It is usual for competing teams to allow the media in to training sessions before match day for just 15 minutes. Yesterday in the heat of Fortaleza, however, Van Gaal declared that he would keep the doors open throughout.

‘The newspapers always think they know my team anyway so what does it matter?’ he smiled. ‘I have no secrets out here. It is not my way.’
