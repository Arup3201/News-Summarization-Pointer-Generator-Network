Three senior police officers accused of lying to blacken Andrew Mitchell’s name yesterday refused to apologise – telling MPs they had ‘done nothing wrong’.

In angry exchanges with MPs, Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones said they stood by their controversial account of a meeting with the former Chief Whip at the height of the Plebgate scandal.

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, told them their evidence was ‘most unsatisfactory’, warning that lying to Parliament was an offence.

Andrew Mitchell resigned a month after the altercation but consistently denied using the term 'plebs'

A secret recording of the meeting in 
Mr Mitchell’s Sutton Coldfield constituency last October, appears to 
show the men accepted his account of his clash with police at the gates 
of Downing Street – even thanking him for his ‘candour’.

But
 minutes later, the officers, all senior figures in the Police 
Federation, told reporters outside that Mr Mitchell had failed to 
apologise and called for him to resign.

David
 Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May have called on the officers to 
apologise but they were unrepentant yesterday, only apologising for 
speaking to the media.

Mr Hinton, of Warwickshire Police, said: ‘We certainly didn’t lie intentionally.’

No apology: Chris Jones, Ken MacKaill and Stuart Hinton repeatedly refused to apologise to Andrew Mitchell despite admitting misleading the public about a meeting with him

Mr
 Jones, of West Midlands Police, said: ‘I’m firmly of the opinion that 
we did represent that meeting correctly when we emerged from that 
meeting.

'At the moment I’m not convinced that we have done anything 
wrong.’

Mr MacKaill, of West Mercia Police, said he stood by his initial
 ‘accurate account’ of what happened in the meeting.

But
 Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘I suggest that you can give an apology for
 spinning a yarn to the press to get somebody out of high public office,
 because it is clear that that is what you were trying to do.’

Criticism: Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, who led an internal inquiry following the meeting of three police officers with former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, said the politician deserved an apology

Doubts: CCTV footage of the original exchange between Mr Mitchell and police officers at the gates of Downing Street raised questions about the official police log

Labour MP Chris Ruane asked: ‘Do you not feel any pity, sympathy and compassion for what he has gone through?’

Deborah
 Glass, deputy chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission,
 told MPs she was ‘absolutely astonished’ that an internal investigation
 by West Mercia Police found they had no case to answer.

David
 Shaw, chief constable of the West Mercia force, yesterday said he had 
offered Mr Mitchell a ‘profound, unreserved apology’ and revealed he had
 ordered an ‘independent’ review of the internal inquiry after rejecting
 calls for such a move only last week.

It
 emerged yesterday that his deputy, with officers from Warwickshire and 
the West Midlands, had watered down the conclusions of the original 
inquiry.

However, the chief constables of the West Midlands and 
Warwickshire forces told MPs their officers had no case to answer.

Eight people including five police 
officers have been arrested as part of the Operation Alice investigation
 into what happened during the 'Plebate' row.

The
 five constables are from the Diplomatic Protection Group, which is 
responsible for guarding politicians and foreign dignitaries, and 
includes a 46-year-old woman present when the row broke out.

Two of the officers - the woman and a man who is also 46 - were arrested over alleged leaks to the media about what happened.
