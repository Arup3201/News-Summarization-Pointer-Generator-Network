Christmas shoppers failed to give stores a much-needed boost, according to figures published today.

High street sales fell last month compared with December 2011, and even online retailers saw a decline in sales, despite a surge in the final days before Christmas as bargain hunters snapped up deals.

Some of the biggest chains, including Marks & Spencer and Morrisons, are expected to reveal worrying trading figures in the next few days.

Festive cheer: Many anxious high street retailers started their sales before Christmas in an attempt to tempt shoppers through the doors, but this failed to make up for weak spending earlier in the festive season

Many anxious high street retailers started their sales before Christmas in an attempt to tempt shoppers through the doors, but this failed to make up for weak spending earlier in the festive season.

Overall consumer spending was down by 1.7 per cent last month compared with December 2011, according to figures released by card company Visa.

Its UK Expenditure Index, compiled by financial information firm Markit, found that high street spending was down by 2 per cent last month compared with December 2011.

Website spending fell by 0.4 per cent over the same period, while mail and telephone-order sales showed the steepest year-on-year decline, tumbling by 3.8 per cent.

The study is based on spending on Visa cards and the figures are then adjusted to reflect all consumer spending.

Steve Perry, commercial director at Visa Europe, said: ‘Consumer spending rallied towards the end of December with week-on-week growth of 12 per cent in the week before Christmas as consumers made the most of the final shopping weekend.

Difficult times: Morrisons, which is the UK's fourth biggest supermarket chain, is among those feared to have done badly over Christmas as it was squeezed by bigger rivals and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl

‘Online spending as a proportion of overall spending stood at 12.5 per cent during this final week, up considerably on 2011, indicating consumers’ increasing preference for online purchases.’

Shares in Marks & Spencer, which is seen as a high street bellwether, have tumbled as fears grow about its performance.

Retail analysts have predicted that clothing sales in October could be down by 9 per cent compared with the previous year, when its results are revealed on Thursday.

Morrisons, which is the UK’s fourth biggest supermarket chain, is among those feared to have done badly over Christmas as it was squeezed by bigger rivals and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl.

Its trading update for the six weeks to the end of December is likely to show like-for-like sales fell by more than 2 per cent on a year ago.

But Tesco and Sainsbury’s, which also publish their figures this week, are expected to show a modest increase in sales compared with Christmas 2011.

The figures are expected to get worse in the coming months as rising energy bills put family budgets under further pressure.

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘Consumer spending remained disappointingly weak in December.

‘With inflation continuing to outstrip pay growth, and worries persisting about job security and the economic outlook, consumer spending looks likely to remain under pressure for some time.’
