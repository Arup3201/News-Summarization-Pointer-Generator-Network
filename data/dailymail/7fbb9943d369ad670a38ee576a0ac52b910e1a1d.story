Ben Foden may not have topped the charts with his Christmas Eve cameo on Hollyoaks but the full-back helped ensure Northampton were flying high in the Aviva Premiership by beating Harlequins at Twickenham.

The England back had a relatively quiet game but, watched by a sell-out crowd of 82,000 at HQ, his side secured a gritty victory to round off the most successful year in their history at a venue where they won the title in May.

Harlequins were ambassadors for running rugby but, despite 71 per cent of first-half possession, they trailed at the break. 

They missed the leadership of Chris Robshaw and Joe Marler, while Saints were also without their skipper, Dylan Hartley. 

The hooker was serving a three-match ban and watched from the stands as Saints conceded the first try to George Lowe after six minutes.

Short-term signing Tim Swiel missed the conversion, but found his range to exchange penalties with Stephen Myler. 

Quins were making all the hard yards early on, the Saints showed the resolve of champions to take the lead. 

Samu Manoa, the American No 8, touched down off the back of a driving line-out.

Manoa will join Toulon in the summer alongside clubmate Salesi Ma’afu. The latter was shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle on Lowe after 3 minutes.

But, as against Leicester last week, Northampton pulled together in adversity and extended their lead with Ma’afu in the sin bin. Myler kicked his second penalty and George North scored after Manoa’s charge down.

England prop Alex Corbisiero came on as Saints looked to consolidate their 12-point advantage, having been out since September. Quins’ Jack Clifford cut the deficit but scrum-half Kahn Fotuali’i dived over for a third try to seal it, despite Sam Twomey’s late reply.
