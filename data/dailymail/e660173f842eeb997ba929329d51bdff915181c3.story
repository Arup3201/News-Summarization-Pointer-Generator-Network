A glittering list of football stars, including arguably the greatest player of all time, Diego Maradona, met Pope Francis today ahead of an inter-religious charity match.

Ahead of the game this evening, Pope Francis was presented with an Argentina shirt by the man known to many for his 'Hand of God' in the 1986 World Cup quarter final defeat of England. 

At the time of fellow Argentinian Pope Francis' election in March, Maradona remarked: 'Everybody in Argentina can remember "the hand of God" in the England match in the 1986 World Cup. Now, in my country, the "hand of God" has brought us an Argentinian pope.'

The players met the Pope prior to the 'football match with peace' this evening at the Olympic Stadium in Rome, that was organised to promote world peace and understanding.

Maradona was joined by former players such as Carlos Valderrama (famous for his distinctive blonde mop), Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, as well as current stars including Lionel Messi and Andrea Pirlo at the Vatican.

The game is part of the Pope's call for 'dialogue' in times of religiously motivated wars and to promote a diplomatic solution to the ongoing crisis in Gaza.

The idea for the match arose in April 2013 following a conversation between former Argentine player Javier Zanetti and Pope Francis.

Speaking in the build-up to the match, Zanetti said: 'When I spoke with Pope Francis about this project, it was a big concern for us to do something for world peace. 

'I think the fact that so many stars have joined in can help professional football support peace. 

'Although the game is raising money for charitable purposes, the most important thing we want to do is spread the Pope's message of peace to the world.' 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and Argentina manager Gerardo 'Tata' Martino will manage the two teams tonight. 

The two teams, named PUPI and SCHOLAS will be captained by Zanetti and Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. 

Wenger's involvement  has been criticised by Arsenal fans who think their manager should be trying to buy a striker before the transfer window closes tonight instead.
