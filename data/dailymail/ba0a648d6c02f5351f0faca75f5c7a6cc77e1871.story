Missing: Christine Marie Tessier disappeared from a San Antonio motel in 2005 and has never been seen again

Convicted child murderer Jack McCullough hid a dark family secret while awaiting trial for the abduction and killing of seven year old Maria Ridulph.

Ex-cop McCullough, 72, was convicted last week of murdering the child in 1957, as prosecutors successfully wrapped up one of the oldest child abduction cases in US history.

But the Mail Online can exclusively reveal McCullough's own daughter is missing -- and it's not known if she's dead or alive.

In a bizarre twist that sheds more light on the convicted killer's complicated family history, his daughter Christine Marie Tessier is missing without trace since 2005.

McCullough changed his name to John Tessier, taking his mother's maiden name some time after he broke up with his first wife, Sonia. He also has a son he has not seen in many years.

Maria's brother claims he has been told McCullough is suspected of having some involvement in his daughter's disappearance.

Police in Illinois who investigated Maria's murder referred questions to Texas, where the then 34-year-old Christine Tessier disappeared. Detectives in San Antonio were unable last night to confirm whether McCullough was ever looked at or questioned in connection with the disappearance.

But Charles Ridulph, 11 at the time of his little sister's abduction, said he was told by the local DeKalb State's Attorney's office that McCullough's daughter had disappeared.

'I think it's a sad, sad situation that he was not arrested and confined long before this because I am certain there are other victims over these many years,' Mr Ridulph said.

'I have no doubt whatsoever. As a matter of fact his own daughter is missing and he's suspected of having something to do with that.

'I think that's the real tragedy here and even in his older years I believe it is important for him to not be allowed to have any contact with the public. I believe he needs to remain in custody for the rest of his life.'

Christine Tessier was last seen at a motel in San Antonio in June 2005. She was last seen with a boyfriend. She is listed as endangered missing, meaning police fear she may be dead.

Jack McCullough's wife Sue, who is adamant her husband had nothing to do with the murder of Maria, said he had no physical contact with his daughter for many years.

'She was into drugs. She left her kids with her mother and took off and that's the last anyone heard of her. Her boyfriends were of very bad quality.'

He spoke on the phone with her and at one point she planned to come to Seattle, Washington, where they lived but it never happened.

And in connection with the murder of Maria, Sue McCullough declared: 'Jack did not do this.'

Mrs McCullough, unable to see her husband since he was first arrested in July 2011 and taken to Illinois for trial, believes McCullough did not stand a chance of being acquitted.

'He's got proof he was in Chicago. He was getting a military exam. A colonel and two sergeants gave affidavits that they had seen Jack this time, this time and the other time.

'Jack never had a chance. They would not let any of the evidence that said where he was.'

Five affidavits taken by the FBI at the time, which placed McCullough far from the murder scene, were ruled inadmissible by Judge James Hallock.

In her very first ever interview, Mrs McCullough said: 'I know a person does not change. They don't kill somebody and say oh that was fun but I will never do it again. He does not even kill bugs, he takes them outside.

'He has already been gone for 14 months. He's an old guy and he does not have many years to screw around with this. My only thing is trying to get Jack home.'

But Charles Ridulph said: 'Regarding his conviction when I was given the details of the state's case early on I never had any doubt that this was in fact the person who had kidnapped and murdered and murdered my sister.

'However because of the age of this case we were cautioned from the very beginning by the State's Attorney and many others that it would certainly be a hard case to prove but as time went on and the pieces began to fall into place I did not have any doubt that he would be convicted.'

Key to the prosecution case was a death bed statement by McCullough's mother, Eileen Tessier. His half sister testified that her mother identified McCullough as Maria's killer.

Also helping to convict McCullough was Maria's best friend at the time, who picked the pensioner out of a photo line up as the same young man named Johnny who was last seen with the young girl ahead of her disappearance.

And the judge also took into account the evidence of three inmates who claimed McCullough confessed to them while awaiting trial.

Sue McCullough said another half sister, in the room when the confession was made, did not hear anything. She also questioned how the friend was able to identify her husband after 55 years as the same person as a teenager and dismissed altogether the testimony of the jailhouse snitches.

But McCullough opted for a bench trial, before a judge alone, without a jury.

His wife said: 'We thought, wrongly of course, that because the judge had seen all five affidavits that he could not in good conscience convict someone who did not do anything.'
