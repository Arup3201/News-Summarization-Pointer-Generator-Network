One of the two live-in lovers of the New Jersey Nazi notorious for naming his son Adolf Hitler has gone on the run from police.

Authorities have been searching for Deborah Campbell for two days after a warrant was issued on Monday for her arrest for the alleged assault of Bethanie Zito, her housemate and fellow girlfriend of Heath Campbell.

Racist Campbell, who has nine children from five different women has blasted law enforcement for conducting a wich-hunt for his ex-wife - claiming they are acting out of prejudice against Nazi's.

Holland Township police have said that Deborah Campbell, 30, fled and possibly crossed a state border after the dispute with Bethanie Zito, 22, on Monday.

Both women have had children with 40-year-old Heath Campbell - Deborah is the mother of seven-year-old Adolf Hitler Campbell while Bethanie is the mother of Eva Braun who was born in November.

Both women have had their children taken away from them by child services.

Bethanie claimed that the incident was a misunderstanding after the two women raced down the stairs at home and Deborah's elbow hit her eye.

Although the police did respond to the home they share with Heath Campbell who has nine children by five different women, Deborah had fled before they arrived.

However, because she had injuries consistent with an assault they issued a warrant for Deborah's arrested according to the Hunterdon Country Democrat despite Bethanie refusing to press charges.

History: In 2010 Heath and Deborah Campbell had their little boy named Adolf Hitler taken away and put into temporary care. The four-year-old boy and his two sisters - JoyceLynn Aryan Nation, 1, and 8-month-old Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie - pictured in December 2008 - were removed from their home by New Jersey's Division of Youth and Family Services

The paper also claimed that police had responded to a dispute on Sunday at the house and Bethanie told said that she did not know who called the police, but that it was not her.

Heath Campbell, who first hit headlines after a bakery refused to ice his son's Nazi-inspired name on a birthday cake, said the argument on the stairs was over nothing.

'They argue about stuff all the time! They're like sisters,' Campbell said according to the Hunterdon Country Democrat.

'Society thinks the Germans and the Nazis are bad people when really we're not. We're family oriented.'

The neo-Nazi said that this latest run-in with the law is another example of the conspiracy against him and his constitutional rights.

'This government here is so against the word 'Naziism.' It's pathetic,' he said. 'You can't breathe without them saying we're violent people and shouldn't have children.'

Campbell, who lives off government assistance, has swastika tattoos across his body, including prominently on his neck, and has frequented headlines since the birthday cake incident in 2008.

He has fathered nine children with five different women but doesn't have custody of any of them.

When he appeared in court earlier this year to fight for custody of his two-year-old son, Heinrich Hons, Campbell was photographed wearing a full Nazi uniform, with his devoted fiancee Bethanie at his side.

He has conceded in the past that it is unorthodox for his ex-wife and fiancé to live together.

'It’s a family thing...They do yarning together. Crochet and all that,' he said.

'We're all fighting for children. We don't need this garbage anymore.'

Heinrich Hons was the fourth child - all with Nazi-inspired names - that Campbell had with his last wife Deborah. He was removed from his parents just hours after being born in November 2011.

The New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services said they took the boy because violence in the home.

They had already placed the couple's other three children – Adolf Hitler Campbell, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell and Honzlynn Jeannie Campbell – in foster care because of the alleged violence in the family's Holland Township, New Jersey home.

Campbell's fiance, 22-year-old Bethanie Zito, gave birth to the little girl in a Pennsylvania hospital on November 11 and the couple named her after Hitler's long-term companion.

After two days, the baby was taken into care by child services.

'I'm not allowed to have children because I’m a Nazi,' Campbell, from New Jersey, explained to the New York Daily News. 'That's what they're saying. Well, I'll stop making them when they stop taking them.'

Zito explained that she was getting ready to leave hospital when nurses took away the little girl and workers from the Franklin County Children and Youth Service announced they were taking her.

'I started screaming,' she said. 'I got hysterical. I had just been checked out. I was breast-feeding my daughter for two days straight. I changed her. I had clothes on her.'

The couple said they never abused their children and argued they were being targeted for the names they chose for their kids.

Authorities insisted putting the children into care had nothing to do with their names.
