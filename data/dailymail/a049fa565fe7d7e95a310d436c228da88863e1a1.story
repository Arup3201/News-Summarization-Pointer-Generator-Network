A stray dog who was seized by the Taliban and saved the lives of two British soldiers in Afghanistan is a contender for a prestigious prize at world famous dog show Crufts. 

Brin, a four-year-old Afghan Kuchi Tiger Mix mongrel, was close to death weighing only 13 kilos when he was found by the Coldstream Guards wandering around a deserted road in Lashkar Gar, Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2010. 

Brin instantly stopped the guards and prevented them from walking over a deadly IED bomb hidden in the desert.

British army officials then adopted the homeless canine and took him on dangerous patrols before he was seized by the Taliban.

Remarkably, Brin survived and was re-captured but when his adopted army unit moved out of Helmand, the dog was set to be deserted and killed, as is army procedure.

Animal lover Sally Baldwin, 51, raised more than £4,000 just in time to get Brin home after learning of his plight through rescue charity Nowzad.

Ms Baldwin, who looks after Brin at her home in Hailsham, East Sussex, said: 'I think the fact that the Taliban didn't kill him is an amazing stroke of luck.

'I have no answer to why they saved his life, normally they would have shot him. They must have thought they had something valuable. 

'The fact that he is alive and living here in the UK is quite seriously an everyday miracle.

'It beggars belief. The fact he has made it to the centre stage of Crufts is phenomenal - it makes us smile every day. 

'He is the voice of animals who have no voice in the theatre of war. Very little thought is given to the suffering of the animals through no fault of their own. Brin being on that centre stage is that voice.'

Brin has been nominated to pick up the gong in The Kennel Club Friends For Life' category on March 10 at the NEC arena in Birmingham.

A live television audience will decide between five nominated dogs as to who receives the £1,500 cash prize, which goes to the owner's chosen charity.

Ms Baldwin, who has owned more than 10 shelter dogs in her life, has been preparing for the ceremony by watching clips online. 

She said: 'On the day Brin has to go on centre stage with the other dogs and wait for the public vote. He will be fine.

Brin was close to death when he was rescued in Helmand. The bright dog now loves his new home in East Sussex and has been nominated for an award in Crufts

'He is quite heavy at the moment at 31 kilos. He needs to be about 28 kilos, it is a mark of a dog that has been starved that they hold on to the weight.

'My dog was nominated for the award by someone at the Nowzad Charity. There is something about him that seriously touches people. 

'Brin was always at the front of the patrol leading the brave lads back to safety through the dangerous areas. He is truly amazing.'

Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, said: 'The dogs nominated for this year's Friends for Life competition help to remind us what it is that makes the relationship between dog and man so very special.

'Each and every one of the finalists has helped to change and save lives, and can teach us all a lesson about loyalty, companionship and bravery.'
