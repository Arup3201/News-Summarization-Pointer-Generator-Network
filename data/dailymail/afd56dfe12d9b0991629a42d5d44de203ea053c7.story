Risky behavior: A new study shows that 27.3per cent of skin cancer survivors in the U.S. never wear sunscreen outdoors

More than one in four people who have had skin cancer do not wear sunscreen, a new study has reported.

The survey, undertaken by the American Association for Cancer Research, found that among those who have had melanoma - the fifth deadliest cancer for men and the seventh for women - 27.3per cent said they never use sunscreen.

Even more shocking, 2.1per cent admitted that they still use tanning beds, which have been linked to skin cancer in several past studies.

The research was based on the results of a 2010 National Health Interview survey involving 27,120 Americans.

While 35.4per cent of the general population said they never use sunscreen, over a quarter of skin cancer survivors said the same.

And even though survivors were more likely to stay in the shade than those with no history of melanoma, the results were still surprising.

Dr Anees Chagpar, an associate professor of surgery at the Yale School of Medicine and the author of the study, was shocked at her findings.

'We expected melanoma survivors to be extraordinarily protective since we know sunlight exposure and tanning increases the risk of a second melanoma,' she told Today.com.

On the contrary, 15.4per cent reported that they rarely or never sit in the shade when outdoors for more than in hour.

Melanoma cases are on the rise, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, which reported that incidences increased 800per cent among young women in the period from 1970 to 2009.

The Foundation also estimates that 76,690 new cases will be diagnosed, and 9,480 Americans will die of melanoma this year alone.

The growing number of cases is due to 
many factors - one of which, says Dr Jack Jacoub, medical oncologist at 
Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California, is 
society's perception that a tan is a sign of health and attractiveness.

'There is a fairly large emphasis on 
beauty in this country,' he told the news website. 'Tanning is a 
reflection of good health, too - the California lifestyle, you wonder if
people know the dangers but choose to ignore them.'

Dr.
Ali Hendi, a clinical assistant professor at Georgetown University 
Medical Center, agrees with this standpoint, noting that statistics seem
to point to the fact that people are not being informed of the risks 
involved in unprotected sunbathing.

'We know that sunlight exposure and tanning increases the risk of a second melanoma'

'We need to do a better job of educating
people,' said Dr Hendi, explaining that if melanoma is caught early, it
is 'essentially curable'.

He believes that people who continue to 
tan even after a skin cancer diagnosis are perhaps addicted to sunshine.
'People can be hooked on tanning,' he explained. 'Sunshine can have a 
euphoric effect on the brain like other addictive substances.'

Indeed, Dr Chagpar notes that in a 
similar vein, some lung cancer survivors continue to smoke even after 
diagnosis since they are addicted to the nicotine.

On the other hand, perennial sunbathers could also be 
satisfying an instinctive desire for vitamin D, says Dr David Fisher, 
head of dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital.

But according Dr Tony Farrenkopf, a clinical psychologist and chairman of psychology at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon, the reason behind this phenomenon is that people who have been diagnosed with skin cancer experience a sense of resignation.

'They say: "I already got it, what other harm can it do?"' he explains - an untrue notion, since a person with a melanoma is nine times more likely to develop a second skin cancer.

In any case, the findings are certainly disturbing. 'They say something about American society, and you wonder if patients have been properly counseled,' said Dr Jacoub.
