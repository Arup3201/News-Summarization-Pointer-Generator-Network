They are both competing for the same role, but last night Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno decided to mock the press attention they are receiving.

The pair made a joint appearance on Monday's episode of 'Late Night'  to sing a parody of 'Tonight' from the musical West Side Story.

They added their own twist to the classic song with lyrics updated to reflect the current rumors about the two men competing for the host job.

Facing up to the rumors: They are both competing for the same role, but last night Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno put decided to mock the press speculation they are under

Leno, 62, is seen at the centre of press scrum at his Burbank studio.

He then gives Fallon a call in New York so they can both discuss the press attention and speculation over who will get the role.

They then launch the song and sing deeply along to a dramatic adaptation of Tonight.

NBC has not confirmed anything regarding a Tonight Show transition - Leno's contract expires next year and it is known that Fallon, 38, is a favorite of the network, where he presents 'Late Night'.

NBC officially denies the claim, although sources told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month that the network is looking to announce his departure in May.

That would make the next season of the show his last.

Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the change-around was being planned for next year and ever since Leno has been on the offensive.

The embattled presenter is showing no signs of backing down in his comedy assault on his network bosses - branding a recent ratings boost a 'miracle' and saying that NBC is a 'big number two' in his show last night.

Bitter? Jay Leno kept up the assault on NBC execs in his show after numerous monologues making fun of bosses

Last week the pot-shots were aimed at the network's recent ratings boost.

'Folks,
listen to this. Monday night the prime time shows The Voice and 
Revolution moved NBC in the number two position,' Leno said.

You know what that means? 
Between Easter and Passover, this is truly the season of miracles. We’re
number two! I’ve been saying for the last week that NBC is a big number
two. Haven’t I been saying that? Congratulations!'

Leno went on to talk about a report that T-Mobile is reducing its contracts, adding: 'Apparently they got the idea from NBC.'

The routine comes hot on the heels of other cutting remarks against executives at the network.

Two weeks ago, Leno joked about a 'make-nice' meeting he had with bosses the night before.

He said to make amends they had offered to send him and his wife on a Carnival cruise - the crippled liner that caused passengers to endure five nightmarish days in the Gulf of Mexico last month.

competition? Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon have been the mainstay of NBC's

In another wisecrack, Leno cited news
reports of a Canadian man who had a knife pulled from his back after 
three years, he sniped: 'He must have worked at NBC, too.'

In another routine he referred to his bosses as 'snakes'.

'You
know the whole legend of St. Patrick right? St. Patrick drove all the 
snakes out of Ireland – and then they came to the United States and 
became NBC executives.'

The
rapid ascent of Fallon and his certain promotion is seen by analysts as
NBC recognizing the competition offered by ABC's popular Jimmy Kimmel.

While Leno's 'Tonight' show still tops the ratings, Kimmel moved his show to the earlier time-slot of 11.35pm to directly compete with him and CBS' David Letterman.

The Times report quoted one senior executive as saying, 'There is no way on earth that this is not going to happen' - a certainty which may explain why Leno isn't holding back the abuse.

'According to several reports, scientists say they are getting closer and closer to being able to do Jurassic Park-style cloning of extinct species,' Leno, he told his audience one night.

'Imagine that. Things that were once thought to be extinct could be brought back from the dead. So there’s hope for NBC. It could turn around.'
