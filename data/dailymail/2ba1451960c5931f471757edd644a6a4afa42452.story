The validity of next year’s General Election is being called into question if the Scots vote for independence.

Currently, voters north of the border are expected to be able to take part next May, meaning Labour could win a majority thanks to its dominance of Scottish constituencies.

In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats in Scotland, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP.

The validity of the 2015 General Election is being called into question because a Labour win means, led by Ed Miliband (pictured) they'd be in charge of a 'zombie government' in power thanks to Scottish MPs

But all Scottish MPs would be swept away in March 2016, when Scotland would become an independent nation. 

One minister said: ‘Labour could win a majority in 2015 but it would be running a zombie government which everyone knows would lose that majority less than a year later. What would happen then? Nobody seems to be thinking about these questions.’

Some MPs now suggest they will call for legislation to be introduced to postpone the election in the event of a yes vote. 

Former Labour MP Eric Joyce, now an independent, said the election would ‘surely be cancelled’

It would be the first time since 1940, a year into the second world war, that a general election would have been postponed.

Former Labour MP Eric Joyce, now an independent, said the election would ‘surely be cancelled’, adding: ‘An English parliamentary election would be an entirely new proposition for voters south of the new border.

‘There could meanwhile be no question that, for example, Labour might win a UK election by a small majority, only to see a Tory government and prime minister take power in England without an election once the Scots had departed. 

'Moreover, the notion of Scottish MPs voting on England-only matters while the whole parliament was consumed by Scots extracting themselves from the union would be nonsensical and unmanageable.’

Angus Robertson, SNP leader at Westminster, called last year for a delay in the election to allow the negotiations on separation to take place. 

But the House of Lords constitution select committee raised doubts about a delay, saying: ‘The extension of a parliament beyond five years ... may risk being seen by voters as self-serving, extending the time in power of the current government.’
