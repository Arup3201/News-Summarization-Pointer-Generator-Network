OLYMPIACOS 3-2 ATLETICO MADRID

Olympiacos got their Champions League campaign off to a winning start as they recorded a 3-2 victory over Atletico Madrid in the Group A clash at Karaiskakis Stadium.

Arthur Masuaku opened the scoring for the hosts and Ibrahim Afellay doubled their lead after 31 minutes before Mario Mandzukic pulled one back for Madrid before half-time.

Kostas Mitroglou made it 3-1 midway through the second half before Antoine Griezmann struck for last season’s beaten finalists at the end.

JUVENTUS 2-0 MALMO

Juventus forward Carlos Tevez ended his Champions League goal drought with both goals in the 2-0 defeat of Malmo.

The Italian champions had struggled to make an impact until Tevez ended a 14-match wait for a Champions League goal with his eye-catching strike just before the hour mark in this Group A opener.

Tevez then made sure of the victory in the 89th minute, curling home a fantastic free-kick from just outside the penalty area.

BENFICA 0-2 ZENIT ST PETERSBURG

Zenit St Petersburg made the ideal start to their Champions League campaign as two first-half goals set them on their way to a comfortable victory at 10-man Benfica.

Hulk opened the scoring as early as the fifth minute and the home side’s hopes of getting back into the contest appeared remote when goalkeeper Artur was dismissed for a professional foul.

Former Benfica midfielder Axel Witsel then doubled Zenit’s lead midway through the half and although the Russian side could not add further misery to their opponents, they ensured they began Group C with an important away victory.

MONACO 1-0 BAYER LEVERKUSEN

Joao Moutinho’s second-half goal ensured Monaco’s return to the Champions League after a 10-year absence ended in victory against Bayer Leverkusen at the Stade Louis II.

Monaco, back in the Champions League group stages for the first time since the 2004/05 season, were second best for much of the contest but Moutinho’s 61st-minute goal settled the match after Leverkusen had wasted a number of chances to take the lead.

The 1-0 victory gives Leonardo Jardim’s side an encouraging start to Group C action ahead of a difficult trip to Saint Petersburg to face Andre Villas-Boas’ Zenit side in a fortnight’s time.

GALATASARAY 1-1 ANDERLECHT

Galatasaray striker Burak Yilmaz netted a stoppage-time equaliser to deny Anderlecht a first away Champions League win for nine years in a 1-1 Group D draw in Istanbul.

Anderlecht - who have finished bottom in all seven group stage campaigns since they reached the last 16 in 2000/01 - looked to be on course for a hard-earned victory after taking the lead early in the second half through Dennis Praet.

Aleksandar Mitrovic missed a great chance to make it 2-0 moments later, which ultimately proved costly.

Galatasaray - now under the guidance of former Italy coach Cesare Prandelli - grew stronger during the closing stages and were eventually rewarded when Yilmaz crashed home following a powerful run by Aurelien Chedjou to earn the hosts a share of the points.
