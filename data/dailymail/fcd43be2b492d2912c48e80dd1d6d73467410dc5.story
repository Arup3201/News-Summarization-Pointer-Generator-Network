Disgraced former San Diego mayor Bob Filner was sentenced Monday to three months of home confinement and three years of probation for harassing women while in office

The decision completed the fall of the former 10-term congressman who barely a year ago achieved his long dream of being elected leader of the nation's eighth-largest city.

Filner, who resigned amid widespread allegations of sexual harassment, pleaded guilty in October to one felony and two misdemeanors for placing a woman in a headlock, kissing another woman and grabbing the buttocks of a third.

Say cheese: Filner, here smiling at his defense team at his Monday sentencing, pleaded not guilty to harassment charges after a drawn out public humiliation saw the former congressman accused by nearly 20 women. Now he'll walk away without serving any jail time

Superior Court Judge Robert Trentacosta's sentence was the same as what prosecutors recommended in a plea agreement with Filner. The 71-year-old former mayor faced a maximum penalty of three years in prison for the felony and one year in jail for each misdemeanor.

The judge specified the Filner may not seek or hold elective office during the term of his probation.

'I want to apologize to my family who have stood by me through this ordeal, to my loyal staff and supporters, to the citizens of San Diego and, most sincerely, to the women who I have hurt and offended,' he said, according to UT San Diego.

He continued: 'To all of you I make the 
same promise that I made to my family, to earn back your trust and my 
integrity no matter how long it takes and what I have to do.'

Accusers: They included the first to publicly point the finger at Filner, Irene McCormack Jackson (center); Michelle Tyler, a nurse who claims Filner made inappropriate advances on her while she was seeking help for a disabled Marine (left) and great-grandmother Peggy Shannon (right)

Sentenced: Filner, here at his sentencing, must serve 90 days home confinement, three years probation, and undergo mental health treatment

He also claimed to have become a changed man since the harassment incidents:

'The letters submitted to this court by my family show the progress that they have already seen,

'Certainly the behaviors before this court today will never be repeated. And I am confident that I will come out of this a better person and I look forward to making further contributions to the city I love.'

Filner, who is divorced, was convicted of felony false imprisonment for restraining a woman against her will at a fund-raiser on March 6 and applying additional force when she resisted. His attorney, Jerry Coughlan, has said it was a headlock.

The misdemeanor counts of battery 
were for kissing a woman on the lips without permission at a ‘Meet the 
Mayor’ event on April 6 and grabbing another woman's buttocks at a May 
25 rally to clean up Fiesta Island in Mission Bay. None of the victims 
have been identified.

Nearly
20 women have publicly identified themselves as targets of Filner's 
unwanted advances, including kissing, groping and requests for dates. 
His accusers include a retired Navy rear admiral, a San Diego State 
University dean and a great-grandmother who volunteers answering senior 
citizens' questions at City Hall.

The
charges do not involve Filner's former communications director, Irene 
McCormack Jackson, who expedited the mayor's downfall by becoming the 
first to go public with sexual harassment allegations in July. She has 
filed a lawsuit against Filner and the city, claiming her boss asked her
to work without panties, demanded kisses, told her he wanted to see her
naked and dragged her in a headlock while whispering in her ear.

Another victim: Bronwyn Ingram, former fiance of San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, broke things off after three years with Filner days before news of his scandal broke

Filner
disappeared from public view after leaving office Aug. 30, less than 
nine months into a four-year term. He said little when he resurfaced six
weeks later to plead guilty in San Diego Superior Court, but his 
attorney told reporters then that the former mayor ‘profusely 
apologizes’ for his behavior.

The former mayor devoted himself to jogging, getting therapy and talking to friends after leaving office, his attorney said in October. Television news crews hoping for a glimpse of Filner were disappointed when he showed up at jail a day earlier than expected for booking.

Filner was elected San Diego's first Democratic mayor in 20 years, promising to put neglected neighborhoods ahead of entrenched downtown business interests. Two city councilmen seeking to replace him in a special election runoff — Republican Kevin Faulconer and Democrat David Alvarez — have embraced Filner's neighborhoods-first mantra while scarcely mentioning the former mayor by name.

Kept coming: Local businesswoman Dianne York became the 18th woman to come forward with accusations against Filner when she spoke at this news conference in August

Range of claims: Charges against Filner ranged from false imprisonment to groping. Great-grandmother Peggy Shannon repeatedly asked her to rub his hands, requested dates and made sexually suggestive comments

'Freedom from Filner': Filner's public flogging was a conspicuous end to what had been a long political career. The 10-term congressman had a long-held dream of running San Diego, but the dream turned bitter after only about a year
