Hand in hand, they entered the court together.

Rolf Harris was joined by relatives including his wife Alwen Hughes and daughter Bindi – as well as a team of security guards – as he appeared at Southwark Crown Court yesterday to face trial.

Smiling, the veteran entertainer  – who is accused of sex attacks on girls as young as seven – bent to kiss his wife before stepping into the dock for the first time.

The 84-year-old Australian is said to have preyed on four youngsters over two decades.

He denies 12 allegations of indecent assault of victims ranging in age from seven to 19 between 1968 and 1986.

Yesterday, an extended jury panel of 17 men and women were selected for his eight-week trial, due to start this week.

Potential
 jurors who were in contact with friends and family in Australia or New 
Zealand were excluded by Mr Justice Sweeney, who told them some of the 
alleged offences occurred abroad.

Wearing a navy suit and snake print tie, the TV star sat quietly throughout the selection.

He spoke only to praise the judge, muttering: ‘He is very good, isn’t he? Very good.’

Harris
 appeared frail at times as he strained to hear the proceedings. During a
 lengthy adjournment he was seen sleeping in a public area outside the 
court beside a lunch box he carried with him into the dock. His 
sculptress wife of 56 years watched him intently as she sat huddled in 
the cold courtroom beneath a poncho covering a summery turquoise dress.

The final jury selection process is expected to take place today before his trial opens tomorrow.

Harris,
 who painted a portrait of the Queen in 2005, has been a fixture on 
British TV screens for more than 40 years. He had his first musical hit 
with Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport in 1960, and continued to enjoy success
 in the industry as well as forging a television career.

Harris,
 from Bray, Berkshire, is facing 12 counts of indecent assault, to which
 he entered not guilty pleas at the same court at a hearing in January.

Sitting in the glass-walled dock in a packed courtroom, Harris watched as an initial panel of possible jurors was selected.

Mr Justice Sweeney told the potential jurors: 'You have been summoned to this court to take part as potential jurors in the selection of the jury panel from which, hopefully in the next day or two, the jury will be chosen to try the defendant, Rolf Harris.

'It is anticipated that the trial will proceed as soon as the jury has been sworn in.

His trial, being heard in front of Mr Justice Sweeney, is expected to take more than six weeks

Harris met his wife, who is said to suffer from crippling arthritis, when they were art students and they married in 1958

'The 
defendant is charged with a number of offences of indecent assault, 
variously alleged to have taken place in the broad period between 1968 
and 1986.

'The evidence overall includes events in Australia and New Zealand.'

Mr Justice Sweeney told the panel of 17 potential jurors chosen from the pool that they are likely to be called back on Thursday.

He said: 'It is vitally important now that you know the case that you may potentially end up as a juror in that you do not, and I underline not, go away and start trying to research this case in any way whether on the internet or otherwise, let alone try to contact anyone involved in the case in any capacity.

'I say no research and no contact with anyone in the case precisely because as I said earlier the jurors who end up trying this case must do so impartially and based only on the evidence given in court during the trial and on absolutely nothing else.'

Six of the indecent assault counts relate to a girl aged 15 between April 1980 and April 1981, and one relates to the same alleged victim when she was aged 19 between January 1984 and January 1985.

Three of the alleged indecent assaults relate to a 14-year-old girl in May 1986.

The other two charges relate to the alleged indecent assault on a girl aged seven or eight between January 1968 and January 1970, and a girl aged 14 between January 1975 and January 1976.

They were also told not to discuss the case.

Mr
 Justice Sweeney told the possible jurors that more potential members 
may be added to the pool, and that they are likely to be called back on 
Thursday.

He told the potential jurors the trial will last until June 27 at the latest.

Harris,
 who painted a portrait of the Queen in 2005 and performed at her 
Diamond Jubilee concert in 2012, has been in the public eye for decades.

He
 had his first musical hit Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport in 1960, and 
continued to enjoy success in the industry as well as forging a 
television career.

Harris, who
 has lived in the village of Bray for more than 50 years, has also 
received a number of honours and was made Officer of the Order of 
Australia in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2012.

Harris met his wife, who is said to suffer from crippling arthritis, when they were art students and they married in 1958.
