Two Australian pilots have been arrested at gunpoint after being forced to land their light plane by two Indonesian fighter jets for allegedly 'violating' the country's airspace. 

Graeme Paul Jacklin and Richard Wayne MacLean were en route from Darwin to the Philippines when their light plane was detected over Indonesian waters at 8am on Wednesday.

Military spokesperson, Major-General Fuad Basya, said the two men did not have permission to fly into Indonesian airspace and initially refused several requests to land, Fairfax Media reports.

Two Indonesian Air Force jets followed the plane and ordered the men to land in Manado shortly after 10.30am local time where they were met by snipers on the tarmac who had their rifles pointed towards the aircraft.     

Mr MacLean, from Burnside in South Australia, and Mr Jacklin from Brisbane were taken from the twin-propellor light aircraft - with the registration VH-RLS - and questioned. 

They remained in custody late on Wednesday for the alleged violation.

Indonesian airforce spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto said the plane came to their attention when it was flying over Timor-Leste - south of the Asian country.

The pair were en route from Darwin to the Philippines to sell the plane when their aircraft was detected over Indonesian waters at 8am on Wednesday

'The plane violated the official path around Saumlaki,' First Marshall Hadi told AAP, referring to a town in Maluku.

'Because they're civilians, the case will be under the authority of airport authorities.

'For now they can't fly, we're waiting until the results of this investigation.'

Violating Indonesian airspace carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $200,000 fine, Fairfax Media reports.

The pair, who are professional delivery pilots, were en route to Cebu in the Philippines to deliver the light plane after selling it.   

Mr MacLean had owned the aircraft since 2006.

Richard MacLean's wife Kaye believes he would have known about obtaining the correct paperwork to fly over Indonesian waters as he 'ferries planes all around the world... it's his job'

His wife Kaye believes Mr MacLean would have known about obtaining the correct paperwork to fly over Indonesian waters as he 'ferries planes all around the world... it's his job'.

'I think there's a misunderstanding.'

Colonel Hesly Paat, the Commander of Sam Ratulangi Military Air Base in Manado where their plane was forced to land, told News Corp he couldn't say what penalty the two Australians would face.

Two Indonesian Air Force jets followed the plane and ordered the men to land in Manado shortly after 10.30am local time 

He said Mr MacLean and Mr Jacklin were still under investigation, but they were not being detained as prisoners. 

Daily Mail Australia understands the Australian Embassy in Jakarta is in contact with Indonesian authorities to seek clarification on the circumstances. 

Consular officials have also made contact with the two Australians who were aboard the plane in order to offer consular assistance. 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says she expects to get a briefing from Australian consular officials in Jakarta on Thursday. 

'We are getting details from the mission in Jakarta,' she told Nine Network.

'We have no specific details of what the Indonesian authorities intend to do.'
