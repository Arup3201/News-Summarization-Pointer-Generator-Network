Teenagers would be made to study maths and English until the age of 18 under a Labour government, the party has revealed.

In a bid to drive up standards, it would become compulsory for pupils in England and Wales to keep up the subjects, even if they leave school at 16.

But education leaders have already warned that the plan, supported by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt, would require training many more teachers.

The announcement from Labour, expected to be confirmed in a major paper on education tomorrow, comes as part of new plans for a 'national baccalaureate' designed to help young people into work.

Their proposal is part of a set of reforms which aims to reduce the number of people who are not in education, employment or training, (NEET) as well as meet the demands of businesses, which consistently complain of low standards in literacy and numeracy.

According to Labour, around one million young people are currently NEET because careers advice and guidance is inadequate.

The new education plan will apply both to students who stay at school to pursue A-levels and to those who leave for apprenticeships.

But education leaders were quick to point out the practical problems with increasing the amount of teaching, and demanding further study when many pupils still fail to reach required standards at GCSE level.

Martin Doel, the chief 
executive of the Association of Colleges, told the Observer: 'In principle asking everyone to do maths and English to the age of 18 is a good idea.

'However, such a commitment would require many more specialist teachers to be recruited and trained. There is also a huge challenge to ensure that half of young people achieve grade A to C in GCSE maths, let alone the next level.'

Organisations offering training or apprenticeships would have to ensure that further maths and English study featured in their programmes, forming a so-called 'technical baccalaureate'.

Schools would also be pressured to make sure that pupils who leave aged 16 move to apprenticeships or another form of training - rather than regular employment or the dole - or face losing funding.

Under the proposals, if too many youngsters leave school but do not continue learning, schools could be fined and the money given to careers advice organisation.

Labour's plan follows an announcement from education secretary Michael Gove that teenagers who fail to achieve C grades in maths of English GCSEs would have to keep studying them beyond sixteen.

However, its proposals are further-reaching, and have been described by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt as a way to reach out to the 'forgotten 50 per cent' of teenagers who do not go to unviersity.

Mr Hunt today said: 'Reforms must focus on driving up standards 
in maths and English, strengthening character and resilience and 
equipping the labour market of the future with the skills set it needs. More of the same just won't do.'

Professor Chris Husbands, who chairs the
 group which made the proposals, said: 'In Britain, we have a poor 
record of delivering high skills and effective qualifications for the 
forgotten 50 per cent: the half of young people for whom the current 
qualifications regime simply does not deliver.

'What we have set out is do-able and practical. Our economic and our social future depends on getting this right.'

Neil Carberry, a spokesman for business lobbying group the CBI said: 'This is an important contribution to building a more effective education system between 14 and 19. Businesses will welcome the focus.'
