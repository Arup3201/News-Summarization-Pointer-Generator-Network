House-hunters are flocking to an unusual bachelor pad on the market for £250,000 - to try out the fireman’s pole.

Kevin Wallace has put his home in Stockbridge, Edinburgh, up for sale - and most viewers are turning up for a go on the 18ft stainless steel pole.

The 30-year-old, who is director of a joinery company, installed the pole as a quick way to reach his basement ‘man cave’.

Mr Wallace said: ‘Anyone who comes to the flat has to go down it - It’s an initiation. Everyone who has come to view it has been down it.’

But he has not fitted a safety rail round the pole and admitted that his home is presently not the best place to bring up young children.

Mr Wallace said: ‘It’s great fun on a Saturday night when your mates are round. I can get down it with a cup of coffee in my hand.’

He added: ‘Even my gran has been down it and she loved it. I just thought, “Oh, wouldn’t it be cool to install a pole to simply slide down into the basement?”

‘As far as bachelor pads go, it ticks all the boxes. It’s a man cave basement, with a 55in television and you can literally get food from the kitchen and slide right down and relax on the sofa.’
