David Cameron gave the green light to a three point plan to force Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to quit yesterday, approving plans to train spindoctors to help the Syrian opposition win support.

British officials will help opposition leaders draw up a joint platform for the future of their country and then train them in how to win over the Syrian people.

Details of the plan were signed off yesterday when the Prime Minister chaired an hour-long meeting of the National Security Council.

Mr Cameron vowed to back fresh 
sanctions by the European Union to freeze the assets of key regime 
figures and ban them from travelling.

He also said Britain would back Arab 
League efforts to finalise a deal which would see Mr Assad hand over 
power to a national unity government ahead of elections.

The crunch meeting came as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov travelled to Syria in a bid to strike a deal.

He said Mr Assad was ready to end the 
bloodshed, which has claimed more than 5,000 lives over the last 11 
months, and hold a referendum on constitutional reforms.

During a visit to Damascus, Mr Lavrov 
said he had received assurances from Mr Assad that he was 'completely 
committed to the task of stopping violence regardless of where it may 
come from'.

Russian Minister Sergey Lavrov (left) said he had received assurances from Bashar al-Assad that he was 'completely committed to the task of stopping violence' wherever it may come from

'President Assad informed (me) that he
 will meet in the coming days with the commission that prepared a draft 
of the new constitution,' Mr Lavrov added.

'The work is finished, and 
now a date will be announced for a referendum on this important document
 for Syria.'

Mr Lavrov appeared to be attempting to salvage some 
diplomatic face after infuriating Arab countries and the West by vetoing
 a UN Security Council resolution condemning the violence at the 
weekend.

But his claims seemed empty last night as the relentless shelling of the rebel stronghold of Homs continued yesterday.

Rebel leaders said that another 19 
people were killed yesterday in Homs, the fourth day of mortar and tank 
attacks which have killed more than 300 people.

Downing Street said Syria's government must be judged by its "savage" actions, not its words.

A spokesman said: 'Our position hasn't changed. We will continue to judge the Syrian regime by its actions not its words.

'Reports that President Assad is ready
 to talk to all the political forces in Syria to end the violence and 
set a date for a referendum for a new constitution stand in stark 
contrast to the actions they are taking and their savage attempt to 
crush the peaceful protests in Homs.'

At the NSC meeting in London , 
politicians and defence chiefs ruled out arming the opposition but 
agreed they would do more to help.

A No 10 spokesman said: 'The work is 
going to focused on three tracks: firstly, support to the Arab League; 
secondly, further sanctions to increase the pressure on the Assad 
regime; and thirdly, work with the Opposition to encourage them to set 
out a clear vision for the future, for a unified and peaceful Syria.'

A 
Whitehall security source said: 'The training is taking place on a one 
to one basis with opposition leaders outside Syria. We are teaching them
 how to be their own spindoctors to help them agree a message and then 
get it out to the people.'

Britain's scepticism was shared by prominent 
members of the Arab League, who have called for President Assad to 
relinquish power.

Members of the six-nation Gulf 
Co-operation Council - Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and 
the United Arab Emirates - are pulling their ambassadors from Syria 
because of Mr Assad's refusal to accept Arab attempts to end the 
country's bloodshed.

Efforts to help the Syrian opposition 
will gather pace at a contact group meeting being planned for the next 
few weeks which will bring together a 'coalition of the willing' of 
countries who want to help.

But Mr Cameron was warned that it 
could take a long time to see the Assad regime fall. Part of the Prime 
Minister's briefing yesterday was to emphasise the strength of the 
Syrian armed forces.

'They can keep up these attacks for a long time,' one source said.
