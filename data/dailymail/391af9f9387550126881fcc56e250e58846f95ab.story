Homophobic slurs cut much deeper than the harshest of tackles for gay rugby player Brennan Bastyovanszky when he moved to Sydney to start a new life 10 years ago.

He may be six foot and 100kg but names still hurt the 35-year-old Canadian who quit the game he loves for four years because after being ostracized from the team he joined in Sydney once it was discovered he was gay.

‘The words and the jokes hurt more than any tackle I’ve ever experienced or any boot that was given to me at the bottom of a ruck – it hurts a lot more, cut a lot deeper and the scars stayed a lot longer,’ he recalls.

Bastyovanszky participated in the Out in the Fields survey which reveals 85 per cent of gay people have witnessed or experienced homophobia when either playing sport or as a spectator.

Brennan Bastyovanszky was ostracized by the rugby team he joined when he moved to Sydney after the club found out he was gay

Bastyovanszky left the club and gave up the game he loves for four years

While half of the 2,500 Australians surveyed have been the target of homophobia and more than one in four gay people had experienced verbal threats, ongoing bullying or were excluded from social groups.

Although Bastyovanszky was the target of such bullying, he didn’t expect the figures to be quite so alarming.

‘I’m not particularly surprised but I didn’t realise it was that bad,’ he said. ‘It confirms how bad it is and that it can happen anywhere.’

Bastyovanszky, 35, moved from Canada to Australia to play rugby and live for the first time as a gay man but deliberately kept both parts of his life separate.

‘I felt like I shouldn’t come out in that environment because there was no one else gay and there was teasing going around,’ he said. ‘ While no one ever physically threatened me, I had concerns about whether or not I would be injured or if not, humiliated, so I never felt like I was part of the group.’

He was playing in first and second grade for about five seasons until his club found out that he was a homosexual and his was quickly living his worst fear.

‘The penny didn’t drop until a new coach asked why I was playing in the fourths,’ he said. ‘All of a sudden merit and ability was not a factor - the sport I loved had rejected me after 15 years.’

Bastyovanszky hasn't look back since joining the Sydney Convicts gay rugby team two years ago

Bastyovanszky had always received subtle homophobic remarks before the club found out about his sexuality but he soon became an outcast as news spread of him being spotted in a gay publication.

‘Some of the players withdrew they didn’t know to interact with me so it became quite an awkward circumstance ‘I would get put on 10 minutes at end of the game so from an administrative perspective it looked like I was playing every week but I was playing less and less and not having a close connection with the guys like I had in previous years.’

He quit the game for four years but was finally convinced to join the gay rugby team Sydney Convicts and has never looked back.

‘I encourage people to go looking for a team where you will be welcome – I have found so much joy and happiness by combining the two loves of my life - being gay and rugby and it took me eight to be comfortable combining them,’ he said.
