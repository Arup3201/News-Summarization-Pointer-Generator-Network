Top award: Reporter Ben Ellery, whose story won Scoop of the Year at the National Press Awards 

The Mail on Sunday has triumphed again at the National Press Awards, winning the most-coveted Scoop Of The Year trophy for the second year running.

The award was given for our exposé about the ‘This is what a feminist looks like’ T-shirts, as worn by Ed Miliband, Harriet Harman and Nick Clegg, that we revealed to be made in Mauritius by women earning just 62p an hour. 

Last year we won the award for our scoop about drug-taking minister Paul Flowers – ‘the crystal Methodist’.

The judges said this year’s winner was ‘a perfect example of an old-fashioned scoop … a simple idea, brilliantly told and with great pictures. 

It embarrassed the politicians and pricked the nation’s social conscience.’

Reporter Ben Ellery, who had travelled to Mauritius with photographer Craig Hibbert, was also highly commended in the Reporter of the Year category.

Mail Sport’s chief reporter Matt Lawton was named Sports Journalist of the Year, and our entire sports team was highly commended in the Team category for ‘outstanding columnists, investigations and great production’.

Also highly commended was Simon Cable for his moving story of how the suicide of Michael McIntyre’s father was kept from the comic for 17 years.

In total, The Mail on Sunday had 13 nominations for the awards, organised by the Society of Editors.

Our latest success proves that, with great scoops, superb magazines, top sport, indispensable finance advice – and a cover price kept at £1.50 since 2007 – The Mail on Sunday continues to bring you unbeatable newspaper quality and value.
