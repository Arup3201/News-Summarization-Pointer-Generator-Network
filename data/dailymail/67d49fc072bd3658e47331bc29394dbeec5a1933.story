With the advent of online shopping and chain stores, for many the high street has changed beyond recognition over the last century.

But as these pictures show, some businesses have remained immune to the whims of fashion, surviving - and prospering - in spite of the profusion of high-street stores and out-of-town shopping centres.

From a cobbler to a pub, some have proved that by bucking the trends and remaining true to their roots, they have flourished in the cut-throat world of business.

The long-running business has survived the changing face of the High Street and is a familiar face on the capital's busy street

One example is a bootmaker that is 165 years old - and has seen prime ministers and singers pass through their doors.

Frequented
 by British prime ministers, Frank Sinatra and Laurence Olivier, John 
Lobb, Bootmaker was founded in 1849 and has been family-run for five 
generations.

'We have a way
 of working which might be considered old fashioned, but it's necessary 
to our work,' said Jonathan Lobb, 44, director and last-maker at John 
Lobb Bootmaker.

'As soon as 
we change something, something else goes awry. It's the nature of what 
we do - and it's something you can't just suddenly change.'

The
 original John Lobb started out as an apprentice in Cornwall, but 
decided to move to Australia and set up on his own after failing to find
 a position in London.

The long-enduring firms include Truefitt and Hill with employee Gino Ruso helping to maintain the business at the oldest hairdresser and barber shop

Unchanged: Paxton and Whitfield Cheese Shop, open since 1797, on Jermyn Street

After founding a successful business there, he made the move back to London, initially setting up shop on Regent Street, before moving to its current St James's Street home.

'It's a family business, which gives it a different feel. Working for a company with this history is quite a privilege,' Jonathan added.

'To my mind, and I've been here for the last twenty years, the history contributes to the character of the company.'

Another beloved institution is the historic Princess Louise pub in Holborn, London.

Still a hit: The famous pie shop has flourished despite the dramatic changes that have hit the British shopping scene in the last few centuries

Caroline Edwards, 44, has run the Princess Louise pub with partner Dave McLellan for the last 20 months.

The site has housed a pub since 1861, but only became known as the Princess Louise since 1872, when it was a gin palace.

'I love being the landlady of a place with such a rich sense of heritage, people come in because it's so ornate. There's a sense of pride there,' Caroline said.

The pub's urinals, floor and wall tiles are all original, while the 'privacy booths' - used to divide the classes and to keep women away - were restored in 2004.

'These days people battle to get in them, there was 25 people squashed into one booth over Christmas,' Caroline added.

Anthony Bunn, 19, from Farnborough, is a sales executive at Bates Hats, which has had a presence on London's Jermyn Street since 1898.

'The history of the company is certainly something I'm aware of. The history and its reputation is within the DNA of the company,' Andrew said.

'The length of the company's history has shaped who we are today. Our customers are definitely interested in the history of Bates.

'Many of our customers ask about Bates' past and stars who have worn our hats through the years. We are very fortunate to have many loyal customers who have stayed with us for many years and been through all our changes with us as well.'
