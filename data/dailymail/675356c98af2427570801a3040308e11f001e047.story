Grieving relatives of the two Australians killed when a Germanwings Airbus was flown into a mountain in the French Alps have visited the memorial in a French village near the crash site.

Relatives of Carol Friday, 68, and her 29-year-old son Greig, both from Melbourne, flew to Europe this weekend and drove into the alps on Monday.

Carol Friday's brother Malcolm Coram and his daughters Georgie and Pippa laid yellow and green Australian flowers, poems and messages at the memorial. 

Melbourne man Coram, who lost his sister and nephew in the Germanwings disaster, says he is not angry about what happened and feels sorry for the parents of the co-pilot accused of deliberately crashing an Airbus A320 into the French Alps. 

Mr Coram is preferring to think of the crash as an accident for now because it's too painful to contemplate his relatives were murdered.

Carol Friday and her son Greig, both from Victoria, were killed when the passenger jet, enroute from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight

Carol Friday and her son Greig died almost a week ago when, prosecutors say, co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane he was flying.

The passenger jet, en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, northern Germany, came down early in the 90-minute flight on Tuesday.

Mr Coram on Monday visited a memorial to them and the other 147 victims in the tiny French village of Le Vernet, near the crash site.

The refrigeration mechanic was joined by his daughters, Georgina and Philippa, who are nurse Carol's nieces and acoustic engineer Greig's cousins.

'I'd dearly love to go up and just visit (the crash site) but we obviously can't,' Mr Coram told reporters after laying flowers at the modest stone memorial.

'This is as close as we're going to get.

'It was very, very sad. You just sort of look at it (the memorial) and say a few words like 'I love you'.'

French officials say the co-pilot deliberately crashed the aircraft but the family are treating it as an accident 

Mr Coram said the entire family, including Carol's husband Dave, was in shock.

'Dave lost half his family in one second,' he said, before adding: 'You feel sorry for the parents of the pilot. Wow, how would you feel if your child did that?'

Carol's other two brothers have remained in Australia 'still in denial', Mr Coram said.

'We have decided to treat this as an accident at this stage and thus deny the perpetrator his wishes.

'There's never going to be conclusive proof of what happened. We like to think of it that way. It helps for us.

'It's better off being calm ... there's no point being angry. It's happened.'

The Corams will stay in the Alps for a few days.

They have some paintings by Carol of the Australian bush they plan to leave at the memorial on Tuesday.

Greig, who was to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering

A statement from the Friday family said Greig was 'a man who loved others and life with a full heart'

They'll also read poems and letters from other family and friends.

Mr Coram then wants to return in September when he could reach the crash site on a new road being built to allow all-terrain vehicles to help transport body parts and remove some of the larger pieces of the Airbus.

'I hope to get more members of the family over here in the next few months,' he said on Monday.

Dave Friday and the couple's daughter Alex were too devastated to travel to France this week.

Investigators have described the difficulty of searching the site as 'unprecedented' due to a combination of mountainous terrain and the violence of the impact.

Lubitz was treated for suicidal tendencies 'several years ago' before he received his pilot's licence, German prosecutors said Monday.

But while they've declared the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane, Georgina Coram believes treating it as an accident, for now, makes coping a little easier.

'The enormity of it right now - with that added emotion - was too much for us at this stage,' she told reporters.

'Maybe down the track we'll be able to process the anger that comes up with thinking that someone did this on purpose and it's essentially murder.'

Georgina said both Carol and Greig loved the outdoors and it helped to know 'that their final resting place is at least somewhere beautiful'. 

Since the plane crash, Greig's Facebook page is now serving as memorial with posts on climate change, world heritage, and gay rights issues.

Greig's former manager at Jacob's engineering Sarah Alper said staff have been left devastated, according to SBS News. 

'It's really devastating because our memory of him is that he was so happy and so excited about his adventure. It is just really sad.'

Carol, a nurse for more than 40 years, had dedicated her life to helping others.

Lisa Fitzpatrick from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said Carol's work with both Indigenous and refugee communities was testament to her generous spirit.

'She's worked with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. She's a woman who's demonstrated that her social perspective in helping others is not something she's just done in her working life but she has certainly been involved with working with refugees when they came from Kosovo to Australia back in the late 90s,' she said.

The Friday family issued a statement through Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  saying they were in 'deep disbelief and crippled with sadness' over the death of the 68-year-old nurse and 29-year-old engineer.

'They were both extraordinary and exceptional people who were loved by many, who they loved in return. They will forever be with us in our hearts, memories and dreams,' it read.  

Mrs Friday, who turned 68 just two days ago, was on a holiday with her son who was planning to remain in Europe so he could teach English.

Greig, who was about to turn 30 on April 23, was a mechanical engineer who studied at Melbourne's Monash University and worked for Jacobs Engineering.  

'He also loved to travel and had just completed a course for teaching English as a foreign language, which he was hoping to do in France in the coming year,' the family said.

'Greig was a man who loved others and life with a full heart.' 

His mother was described as a devoted wife to her husband Dave and loving mother to Greig and daughter Alex. She was a registered nurse and midwife who regularly travelled.

'Carol loved life! She enjoyed every minute with her family and friends,' her family said.

'She was a talented artist and enjoyed spending time creating with her local art group. She loved to travel and has seen many of the world's greatest sights.

'Carol and Greig were enjoying a few weeks holiday together at the start of his European stay.'
