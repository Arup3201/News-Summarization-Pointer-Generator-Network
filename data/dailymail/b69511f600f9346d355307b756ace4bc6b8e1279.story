Two orphaned wallaby joeys are getting to know each other and could soon become playmates after being rescued from the roadside.

The  female swamp joeys named Khaleesi and Alkira are Sydney Taronga Zoo’s newest additions to the family.

Zookeepers Jodie Carr and Matt Dea have taken on the role of surrogate parents after the joey's mothers were both struck by a car and killed.

But the furry little creatures have been receiving round-the-clock care and keeping everyone busy while melting the zookeepers hearts.

Ms Carr said the pair could soon be put into a crèche together to socialise and play during the day, as they grow and become more independent.

‘Khaleesi is already incredibly confident. She’s starting to hop out of her makeshift pouch for a quick bound around the bedroom at 3am,’ she said.

Ms Carr has been hand-raising baby Khaleesi for the past month after she was found in her dead mother’s pouch on the side of the road at Beacon Hill in Sydney’s north-east.

‘She had a few little scrapes on her feet, but otherwise she was in good health,’ Ms Carr said.

The surrogate mother has been carrying Khaleesi in a makeshift pouch around her waist and breaking from her normal duties looking after Taronga’s big cats to bottle feed her four times a day with the help from her fellow keepers.

'All the carnivore keepers have just melted over her. They bring in native flowers, leaves and grass for her each day and she gets plenty of love and attention around the office,” she said.

Ms Carr said Alkira and Khaleesi’s stories should serve as a reminder for motorists to watch out for wildlife on the roads this summer.

‘It’s also really important to stop and check those pouches, as it could mean saving a little life like Khaleesi’s,’ she said.

In September, Alikira, whose name means ‘sunshine’ was brought to the Taronga Wildlife Hospital two weeks before Khaleesi, after her mother was killed by a car at Oxford Falls, north of Sydney.

Matt Dea, co-ordinator for Taronga's Roar and Snore sleepover event has been hand-raising the female joey by carrying a makeshift pouch and waking up at 2am for one of five daily bottle feeds.

'Caring for such a young joey is very involved and she hasn't left my side,' Mr Dea said.

'She comes home with me, she comes to the shops and she sleeps beside my desk at work each day.'

Taronga Wildlife Hospital cares for and treats over 1,000 injured or orphaned native animals every year, including wombats, wallabies, possums, echidnas, birds and sea turtles.
