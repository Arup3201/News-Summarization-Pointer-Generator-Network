While Jack Wilshere was snapped smoking and drinking before the new Premier League season, team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took a more laid-back approach to his holiday.

Oxlade-Chamberlain was seen relaxing with friends on the exclusive Sala Beach in Puerto Banus ahead of his pres-season training with Arsenal.

This break is in stark contrast to that of fellow Gunners midfielder Wilshere, who was caught enjoying a cigarette on his Las Vegas holiday with Joe Hart and James Milner.

The Ox seemed at ease after a difficult summer. Despite showing some promising form in England's friendlies before the World Cup, the 20-year-old former Southampton star was injured in a warm-up game and failed to make a single appearance during the dismal campaign.

That knee injury, sustained during England's 2-2 draw with Ecuador, and a further problem with his groin have led to Oxlade-Chamberlain enduring another frustrating summer after being plagued by fitness problems last season.

With the signing of Alexis Sanchez, competition for places is hotting up at the Emirates and Oxlade-Chamberlain will be hoping that he is up to the challenge.
