Sean Jennings has been offering singing lessons as a vocal coach under the name Sean Jeffrey 

A talent scout who worked with X Factor and Britain's Got Talent acts has been exposed as a convicted paedophile.

Sean Jennings has been coaching artists vying for a place on the talent shows after changing his name to hide his conviction for assaulting a 12-year-old boy.

The 42-year-old, who now calls himself Sean Jeffrey, was jailed in 2003 after police discovered more than 10,000 indecent images of young boys at his Bristol home.  

He spent four-and-a-half years in prison before changing his name and attending the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. 

Now, a Sun on Sunday investigation by Michael Hamilton has revealed the criminal submitted acts to two of Simon Cowell's talent programmes.  

Though Jennings has not been worked directly with either the X Factor or Britain's Got Talent, one of the groups he has managed was successful in securing a place in the latter. 

The X Factor now allows acts as young as 15 to apply for an audition.  

A Syco spokesman said the staff at the company were completely unaware of his past and were appalled to learn of it.

'He has never been a vocal coach on the shows and has never been paid by Syco, X Factor or Britain's Got Talent.

He added: 'We will not have any contact with him and certainly will not appreciate this man trying to contact us in the future.'

Offering vocal coaching for £60-an-hour, the man's website boasts he has appointments at Syco and teaches 'current and past stars' of some of London's most successful West End shows.

When confronted he confirmed he was a vocal coach, but stopped short of admitting he had changed his name from Jennings to Jeffrey before telling journalists: 'I need to take advice'. 

But he said he was 'strict' about never working with children.

Facebook and Twitter pages set up under his new name were immediately removed.

A spokesman for Syco, the production company in charge of the X Factor (pictured) and Britain's Got Talent said Jennings had unsuccessfully submitted acts to the shows but was never paid and has never worked for them

Child protection expert Mark Williams-Thomas said the discovery was worrying for young artists trying to succeed in the music industry. 

'I'd be very concerned about any employment or activity that brings him into contact with boys aged ten to 16. 

'It just shows how easy it is to work with children with convictions.' 

MailOnline has contacted Metropolitan Police Paedophile Command.
