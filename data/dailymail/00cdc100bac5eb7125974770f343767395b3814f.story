An outbreak of a measles-like virus affecting Bottlenose dolphins has become the largest in history - resulting in 753 dolphins washing up on beaches along the East Coast since July.

And it's only getting worse. As Bottlenose herds migrate south for the winter, they may spread morbillivirus to local groups in Florida.

The only other time an outbreak this bad happened was between August 1987 and April 1988 when the virus killed 740 dolphins. The current outbreak has already exceeded that death toll and if it plays out on the same time frame - it isn't even halfway over.

Outbreak: Since July, 753 dolphins have washed up dead on East Coach beaches, most having died form a strain of a measles-like virus

Spreading: Researchers now fear that the outbreak will get worse with herbs moving south for the winter. Above, researchers conduct a necropsy on a dead dolphin in Virginia Beach, Virginia in August

Largest in history: The current outbreak has already eclipsed the last largest outbreak of morbillivirus which killed 740 dolphins between August 1987 and April 1988

While the virus hasn't impacted other species of dolphins in the North and Mid-Atlantic, there is evidence that it may be killing some whales after the bodies of three humpback whales and two pygmy whales were recently found decaying on beaches.

Researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) haven't been able to confirm yet whether these whales were suffering from the same virus since their bodes were 'very decomposed'.

Teri Rowles, of the NOAA Fishers Marine Mammal Stranding Response Program, said in a conference call today that the number of dead beached whales is 'slightly' elevated' from usual but that it's too early to know if it's an outbreak in the whale population.

Bottlenose dolphins continue to wash up on beaches on the East Coast, but more and more are showing up further south as the herds migrate to Florida for the winter.

Researchers are now afraid that the outbreak will worsen and spread to local populations of dolphins in warmer waters. The virus spreads with contact and shared air.

'We don't know how this is going to play out,' Rowles said.

Whales as well: Researchers believe that the virus may be spreading to humpback and pygmy whales, though it isn't impacting other species of dolphins

Too early to tell: NOAA researchers haven't been able to confirm a whale outbreak since the five stranded bodies were so decomposed, making it hard to analyze their tissue

Unfortunately, all researchers can do is watch the outbreak unfold.

'There is no vaccine that can be deployed for a large Bottlenose dolphin population or any cetacean species. Currently there is nothing that can be done to prevent the infection spreading, or prevent animals that get infected from having severe clinical disease,' she said.

While the disease can't be spread to humans, it does have the potential to impact people.

The virus leaves the dolphins susceptible to secondary diseases or viruses which have the possibility to infect humans if they come into contact with the rotting sea creatures on the beach.Â 

The NOAA recommends that any beached dolphins or whales be reported to local stranding coordinators.

'What we're trying to prevent people from doing is push them back out,' Rowles said.

No help: Researchers say there is nothing they can do to prevent the outbreak from spreading

Hundreds of dolphins have washed up on East Coast beaches since July

Researchers say the problem hasn't stopped and that Bottlenose dolphins threaten to spread the disease during their yearly migration south

The bodies of five whales have also washed ashore, and may be suffering from the same measles-like virus

Current outbreak of morbillivirus is largest in history, recently eclipsing previous outbreak in the late 80s which killed 740 dolphins
