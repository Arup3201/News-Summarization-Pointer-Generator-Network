In a nightclub on the Mediterranean coast, a man wearing a hat to disguise his identity slips into the DJ stand and takes control of the decks, where he plays his records until sunrise.

Earlier that evening — in front of many of the same folk on the dance floor — that very same DJ had dictated a different kind of rhythm... a football match in front of 55,000 fans at Valencia’s Mestalla Stadium.

Only now has Gaizka Mendieta revealed his secret in an interview which explores the football career he very nearly abandoned.

But it is the subject of music which hits the right note with the former Valencia, Lazio, Barcelona and Middlesbrough star, who last month played the Cavern Club in Liverpool made famous by The Beatles.

‘It has always been my passion,’ says the 40-year-old. ‘My friend in Valencia, who owned a record shop, used to DJ. If I played on Saturday I would then sneak into the club, but it was always off the record, I would wear a hat and go in disguise. I would then DJ and no-one would know it was me. I loved it. It was an escape.’

Mendieta was a platinum-standard schemer who manipulated the mood of a match with his cunning. Much like the DJ.

‘I don’t have a setlist of what I’m going to play. We take a box of vinyls and we only arrange the first few songs and then see how the mood is and what people want,’ he says. ‘When you are on the pitch you have a split-second to decide a pass, it is the same as a DJ picking the next song. It is the same feeling of tension as playing football and I do get nervous before I DJ.

‘But that is good, that’s the way I enjoy things. It is the possibility of making people happy, seeing them having fun and going mad at your choice of song.

‘I play everything from Aretha Franklin to Kings of Leon to Lou Reed. Wherever I am in the world I always find the record shops.’

While we had to wait until the turn of the millennium to see Mendieta in successive Champions League finals with Valencia and twice being named European Midfielder of the Year, we could have witnessed his talents at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics had his life taken a different track.

‘My story is unusual,’ he laughs, when asked about the journey which saw him become one of the world’s most expensive footballers after Lazio signed him from Valencia for £30million in 2001.

‘At 14 I stopped playing football and dedicated my time to athletics. As a kid I used to go to athletics school where we would train three times a day and study. I loved it, it’s what I wanted to do. I held the Spanish record for 2,000 metres which stood for 15 years.

‘But when I was 16 I quit and went back to football and I signed for Castellon (in the Spanish second division). To be honest, I wasn’t that good. I was a good athlete, so I would run and cover a lot of ground and then make a simple pass.

‘Look at my early games with Castellon and Valencia, I could pass the ball, but I was nowhere near the player I became. My friends used to say: “Who is this kid? He can’t keep the ball up three times!”

‘They used to joke with me but then look what happened. I worked hard and my game became more about technique than running.’

Mendieta was one of four brothers and their dad, Andres, was a professional with Real Madrid, Deportivo La Coruna and Villarreal. His sons, however, were not born with natural talent.

PS It goes the other way too. Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias was Real Madrid’s reserve keeper before becoming a pop star.

‘My brothers weren’t very good and I wasn’t great but I just wanted to improve so badly so I practised for days and days. I used to go to fields with my brothers and my dad to practise. I used to go in a squash court with a ball and just kick, kick, kick. My dad was really sad when I quit for athletics because he would have loved me to be a footballer. But he always supported me because both he and my mum wanted me to be happy. So they were very proud at what I went on to achieve.’

What did he achieve? Eight goals in 40 caps for Spain, the Champions League runners-up medals, a Spanish Cup with Valencia and a League Cup at Middlesbrough. So how did he end up on Teesside? ‘The chance to come to England arose in a way I didn’t expect,’ says Mendieta, whose first season at Lazio had been an unhappy one. ‘Steve McClaren and Keith Lamb, the chief executive, turned up at the training ground in Rome.

‘They told me about the new project they wanted to build. I told them I would think about it but, after a little time, I thought, “Why not?”. I wanted to be part of their plans and help them make history — which I did.’

Indeed, Mendieta loved the North East so much that he only swapped it for St Albans last year, so he would be closer to his work with Sky Sports, where he is a pundit for their La Liga coverage.

Mendieta, who has two daughters, is busy juggling his music, punditry and commitment to earning his coaching badges.

It would, you feel, be a loss if he never returned to a training pitch, for he has learned from some of the game’s greatest, including Louis van Gaal at Barcelona.

‘He was great,’ says Mendieta. ‘Even if he comes across as quite distant and authoritative, he’s not, you can talk to him any time.

‘I remember in pre-season two of the players’ wives had given birth and we thought he would not let them go. But he told them “Go, see your family, come back when you are ready”.

‘But he needs time. He likes to do things in his own way and what he believes to be the best way for the team. He will be successful. Van Gaal has the hunger for that, otherwise he would not have come. He sees Manchester United as a challenge and wants to take them where they deserve to be.’

Mendieta, then, is backing his old boss to get United in tune. As for himself? ‘If you’d asked me a few years back about management I would say no. But now, you never know,’ he says.

Kind of like his next record, Mendieta will see where the mood takes him.
