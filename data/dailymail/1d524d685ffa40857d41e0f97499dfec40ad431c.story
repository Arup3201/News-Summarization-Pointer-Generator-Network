Popular former postman Alan Johnson has refused to come to Ed Miliband's rescue, as a poll reveals the Labour leader is facing an uphill battle with female voters.

Mr Johnson has been the subject of mounting speculation that he could be installed as a caretaker leader if Mr Miliband is ousted, but he insists he will play no part in Labour's frontline fight from opposition.

Amid rumours of a possible Labour defection to UKIP and growing fears he is turning off voters, a new survey shows just one in 10 women think Mr Miliband is good enough to be prime minister. 

The former Home Secretary said he would not consider taking over as leader of the Labour party if approached 

Mr Miliband has so far failed to win over women as he campaigns ahead of next year's general election, with only 12 per cent describing him as a good leader.

His popularity among female voters pales behind that of David Cameron, who was backed by 31 per cent of women in a recent poll. 

The 19 point gap is among latest indicators the Labour leader may cost the party next year's vote, sources say. 

Concerns among MPs are so rife, some have suggested drafting in Mr Johnson, the  former Home Secretary, to take the reins.

But Mr Johnson today rejected the claims, and even refused to join Mr Miliband's frontbench to fight for power ahead of the election.

Asked if he had been approached about becoming Labour leader, Mr Johnson told the Sunday Times: 'No. First of all, the question doesn't arise. Anybody who suggested to me — and no one has, incidentally — that there should be a change of leadership, I would say, "Get a grip."'  

But he also made clear he would refuse any request from Mr Miliband to join the shadow cabinet.

He served as shadow home secretary and briefly shadow chancellor, before resigning when he learned of his wife's affair with his police protection officer.

He said he 'hated' being on the frontbench in opposition and wishes he quit Mr Miliband's team sooner 'because if you're not enjoying it and your heart's not in it then it shows that you're not going to do it properly'.

It is a fresh blow for Mr Miliband who is facing fresh claims he is failing to convince voters he is up to the job of running the country. Fifteen per cent of the 1,005 adults polled as part of the research by ICM said Mr Miliband would be a good prime minister. 

Critics blamed Mr Miliband's forgetting to mention the deficit in his party conference speech. David Cameron was more popular among women, with 31 per cent saying they think he is a good prime minister 

More than double that (32 per cent) put their support behind David Cameron, with experts citing the Labour leader's failure to mention the deficit during his party conference speech as the reason for his ailing popularity. 

In 2009 former prime minister Gordon Brown received 32 per cent while the Conservative party leader had 48 per cent of voters' support. 

'If any doubt remained about Ed Miliband's prime ministerial attributes, reaction to his conference forgetfulness probably ends it,' Martin Boon, director of ICM Research told the Sunday Telegraph. 

'Despite Mr Cameron falling to Brown-like levels of disdain in this poll, Ed Miliband is patently written off as twice as bad.' 

'It's hard to think how a leader could do much worse than this and any lead that Labour does still hold in the polls must be thought to be despite its leader, rather than because of him,' Mr Boon added. 

In a previous poll female voters described Mr Miliband as 'weak', 'useless' and 'an idiot'. 

'Untrustworthy' and 'trying' were other adjectives offered, while David Cameron was seen as 'posh' and 'out of touch'. 

Nick Clegg was described as a 'follower' in a separate poll. Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) was not included in the research, but said yesterday at the Rochester and Strood by-election he thought his party could win in May 

Forty-one per cent of women who took part in the poll by Tory chairman Lord Ashcroft said they supported Labour in March. 

When asked about Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg, respondents considered him a 'follower' and some didn't know who he was. 

The poll did not ask voters about Ukip, to which two Tory MPs have defected since it was carried out. 

Yesterday it's leader Nigel Farage said the party was in with a shot of winning as he supported Mark Reckless MP in the Rochester and Strood by-election. 

MPs concern over Ed Miliband's ability to lead the party to victory in seven months was voiced by Andrew MacKinlay. 

The former MP for Thurlock referred to Mr Miliband's campaign as 'a complete disaster,' pleading: '  ‘Ed – for the sake of the party we both love, please stand aside now.'
