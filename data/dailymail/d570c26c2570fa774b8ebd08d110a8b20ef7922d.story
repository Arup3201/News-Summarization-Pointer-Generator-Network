Feel like you need to get away from it all, but don’t have time to go anywhere?

Swiss designers have invented a human-sized bubble, described as a ‘place of retreat’ for people who want a bit of peace but don’t want to be completely out of touch.

The transparent globes made by Swiss designers Micasa Lab can be used in a room, outside, attached to the ceiling – or even put in water. A net enables it to be hung in trees, on buildings, or in a cluster of other cocoons.

Time to yourself: The Cocoon 1 creates a space for relaxation that can be transported into any environment

By adding different modules the functions of the $3,000 Cocoon 1 can be changed, for example adding sleeping or storage modules. 

For outdoor use, a power pack has enough energy for 40 hours of light or 20 hours of light and 30 minutes of cooking.

Specially designed pillows are available as well as the option of wifi. Users can add basic cooking facilities and water with a pipe fitted for outflow. The Cocoon 1, which has a 180 cm diameter and weighs 97 kg will go on sale later this year.

Taking time out: The Cocoon 1 can even offer a quiet place to sit and read a book indoors, regardless of what is going on around

Bubble away from the toil and trouble: Furniture - or modules - can be inserted into the globes to increase functionality

Relaxation: The orbs can be transported to secluded spots to offer some small protection against the elements

Added extras: The Cocoon 1 can be fitted with a kitchen or even a sink to increase its uses

Nesting: A giant net can be used to hang the Cocoon 1 from a tree to allow users to find peace in nature

Get away from it all: The living spaces can be kitted out to reduce the number of reasons you would have to leave them

Child's play: The simple design, primary colours and building block style modules are reminiscent of children's toys
