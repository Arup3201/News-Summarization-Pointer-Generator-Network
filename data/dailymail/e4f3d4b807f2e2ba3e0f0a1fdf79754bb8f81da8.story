Its stock in trade is cut-and-blow-drys rather than Jamaican ginger cake, mops and pineapple chunks.

But now the net-curtained Beautique hair salon is ready for a makeover of its own - to turn it back into the setting for stammering, skinflint Arkwright’s corner shop.

With Open All Hours about to return to our screens after nearly 30 years for a Christmas special, the end-of-terrace shop is once again to be the setting for the late Ronnie Barker’s grocery store.

The salon in the Doncaster suburb of Balby, South Yorkshire, was used as the exterior of the overcrowded, old-fashioned grocery store run by Arkwright and his put-upon assistant Granville, played by Sir David Jason, in the original hit series.

Yesterday Helen Ibbotson, 82, who started the hair salon in 1962, said she believed the show’s makers chose her shop back then because its writer Roy Clark’s father used to have a corner shop and Roy was local to the area.

For the series that ran from 1976 to 1985 watched by 17million viewers a week, producers fitted a fake shop sign, stacked tins in the windows and piled vegetables and cooking pots on tables outside as they transformed Beautique into Arkwright’s. It was there, at the end of each episode, that Arkwright would reflect on the events of the day as he packed his wares away.

Ironically, before Mrs Ibbotson began her business the shop had actually been a greengrocer - and when she took it over her late husband had to remove lots of tinned goods from the cellar.

After she retired aged 67, she passed the shop on to her daughter Lisa Taylor, a hairdresser, who has run it ever since, although the salon now only opens twice a week.

Yesterday mother of two Mrs Taylor said ‘a man from the BBC’ came to the shop last Thursday with regard to filming the one-off Christmas special there and told her it was ‘all a bit top secret as they hadn’t been given the go ahead yet’.

‘Then he rang me last night and said it’s going ahead. It is definitely going to happen in November for about three days,’ she said.

Transformed: The shop as the famous grocery store where owner Albert Arkwright, played by the late Ronnie Barker, tormented his nephew Granville, played by David Jason  in the show that ran from 1976 to 1985

Recalling how the salon was first chosen back in the 1970s, Mrs Ibbotson said: ‘The producer rang me and asked ‘could we borrow your shop?’ and I said ‘you’re joking aren’t you?’, but he said he wasn’t.

‘He came and met us at the shop and then the rest is history really. I’d like to see another episode filmed, it was good.’ She can also clearly remember mingling with stars Jason and Barker when they were on set.

‘I think they came about four of five times, they came once and they were in for three weeks,’ she said. ‘They would come at three weeks at a time and they would pay us to use the shop.

‘At one time I was that busy they rented me another shop to do the hairdressing in, just up the road.’ In 2006, the shop was threatened with demolition after council chiefs warned that pre-1919 housing may have to be demolished in a regeneration drive. But luckily for Mrs Taylor - and, as it turns out, Open All Hours’ makers - it survived.

Open All Hours was an affectionate comedy set in a grocery shop on the corner of a sloping street in a Yorkshire town

Plans for the Christmas special were announced by the BBC earlier this week. In it, Sir David Jason will once again play Granville, but this time he is in charge after Arkwright has died and passed the son on to his nephew in his will.

Last night a BBC source said: ‘It’s still early stages and we’re still planning exactly when and where filming will take place.’ Meanwhile, a corner shop thought to have inspired the classic TV sitcom Open All Hours has long since closed and been turned into a family home.

Meecham & Sons, which was run by Brian Meecham in Crewkerne, Somerset, shut for the last time in 1998 after 70 years. It was run by his father George before him.

Before his death aged 78 last year, Brian Meecham revealed that Barker was a frequent customer when the comedian had a holiday cottage six miles away at Beaminster.

‘I recall him coming to the shop for boiled sweets - bull’s eyes, if I remember rightly. No one realised he was taking away the inspiration for a series as well,’ he said.

Yesterday his daughter Debra Spurway said: ‘Ronnie Barker famously said that he took inspiration from everywhere he went and everything he saw so it is entirely possible Dad and his shop were an inspiration.’
