Wayne Rooney may want to get practicing his high-flying manoeuvres once again after World Wrestling Entertainment Superstar Wade Barrett called him out on Twitter on Tuesday night. 

Following Rooney's much-debated tumble that led to a penalty in Manchester United's FA Cup fifth round win over Preston on Monday, the 6ft 7in WWE man mountain - who spent his childhood in Preston - took to social media to voice his opinion.

'How about that @WayneRooney dive vs @PNEFC?' Wade tweeted.

'He won't need to dive when I catch up with him.. #BullHammer #BNB.' 

But despite the acrobatic prowess shown by the England captain at Deepdale, Rooney's rebuttal would have suggested he was not quite up for climbing into a ring alone with 'Bad News Barrett'.

In an attempt to quell the advances of the former bare-knuckle boxer, the Three Lions skipper's idea to to bring in former WWE Heavyweight Champion 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin merely fuelled the fire.

'@WadeBarrett ill get stone cold Steve Austin out of retirement for you. Haha', the Manchester United star quipped. 

Just like a well-scripted scene synonymous with the WWE, current Intercontinental Champion Wade then drafted in the help of another English footballer in the form of PNE's Kevin Davies, prompting WWE CEO Vince McMahon into arranging a tag-team bout.

'.@WayneRooney you and @steveaustinBSR Vs me and @Kevin__Davies at Wrestlemania in 6 weeks. Get it booked @VinceMcMahon.'

In true pantomime style, Austin 'The Rattlesnake' himself showed up late to the party to enforce his authority. All that was missing was the smashing glass sound effect.

'Embrace the baldness. And that's the bottom line...,' the Texan ordered.  

One fan eager to see the match go ahead even had time to mock up a poster of Rooney and Wade in their battle poses. Mayweather vs Pacquiao may have met its match.

Stone Cold Steve Austin also entered the conversation in true pantomime style
