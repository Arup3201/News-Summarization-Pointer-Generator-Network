Arsenal are chasing Real Sociedad's £18million-rated forward Antoine Griezmann - while a return for former skipper Cesc Fabregas is also being considered.

Griezmann, 23, has earned rave reviews among Gunners scouts and the club are seriously considering a move for the Frenchman, who has been named in Didier Deschamps' World Cup squad.

Speaking in March, manager Arsene Wenger said: 'We are following him [Griezmann] in great detail. He attracts other clubs as well but we follow him, he is a known commodity.'

But it is the possible return of Fabregas that will get Arsenal fans excited this summer.

The midfielder's future at Barcelona is uncertain following the arrival of new manager Luis Enrique, a situation the Gunners have been made aware of.

And the FA Cup winners are refusing to close the door on a return for Fabregas, who still has a close relationship with manager Wenger.

Arsenal secured a buy-back option on Fabregas upon selling him to Barcelona in 2011, a stipulation which leaves them in pole position to sign the midfielder.

Sources close to Fabregas maintain his preferred destination should he return to the Premier League is the Emirates Stadium.

Manchester United have been linked with a fresh move for Fabregas following the club's foiled attempt to sign him last summer.

The Spaniard is also likely to attract Manchester City given he meets home-grown quota regulations.
