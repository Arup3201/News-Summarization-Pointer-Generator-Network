Calls to reduce speed limit to 30km/h would help save lives and prevent accidents, says an Adelaide University cycling expert.

Dr Jennifer Bonham told The Advertiser that reducing speed limit on residential roads should be highly considered for the safety of cyclists, as well as pedestrians and drivers.

The senior lecturer and author is currently undertaking an Australian Road Research Board, a project which received $45,000 funding last month.

Dr Bonham told Daily Mail Australia that the project will look at the type of road infrastructure, which is being put in place across Australia to improve safety and convenience for cyclists.

'We are interested in how cyclists and motorists interact with this infrastructure and whether it is effective to assuring safety and convenience for all road users,' she said.

'The keys to improving safety cycling is design, construction and regulation of all roads to ensure the safety and convenience of all road users.

The Adelaide Government reported the move of speed limit cut last year had save an estimated 100 lives and $1 billion in property damage and health costs.

In 2011, the government reduced limits from 110km/h to 100km/h on 864km of regional roads.

Places like the Netherlands do no more than 30km/h in residential areas as this is regarded as the safest speed

Dr Bonham said that the positive impact of reducing suburban speed limits from 60km/h to 50km/h highlighted the benefits of slower travelling car.

'I'm suggesting we should try 40km/h and if at some future point - especially as we get more intense (housing) development in suburban areas - we may want to travel at no more than 30km/h.'

'So we get used to 40km/h and then start thinking about if we need to move to further reductions,' she said.

The trend to reducing speed limits are already common in some European countries.

'In places like the Netherlands you canâ€™t do more than 30km/h in residential areas because they regard this as the safest speed and they have been doing this for 40 years,' she said.

The Centre for Accident Research & Road Safety found an average of 35 cyclists are killed and over 25,000 are seriously injured on Australian public roads each year.
