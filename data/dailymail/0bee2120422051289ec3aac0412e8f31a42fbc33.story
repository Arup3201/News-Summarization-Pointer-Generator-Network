There was no champagne celebration in the nightclubs of Tallinn for Estonian defender Artur Pikk on Sunday night, despite the fact he was making his first start for his country.

The 21-year-old left back, who had to stop Jordan Henderson and Calum Chambers, had no time to contemplate a fine performance in which his team almost took a point off England as he is currently on national service and was due back in barracks at midnight.

The Estonian army impose a strict curfew with no exceptions so Pikk had to head off immediately after the game to ensure he made it in time to his Tallinn army base.

Pikk had only played five minutes for his country as a substitute before last night but was chosen by Estonian manager Magnis Pehrsson, and fits in national service around playing for his club team, FC Levadia Tallinn.

Meanwhile Pehrsson seemed unimpressed with England’s struggles to break down his team after the sending off of Estonian captain Ragnar Klavan just after half time.

Pehrsson said: ‘I felt that England were not that dangerous. When they scored from the free kick, it felt like they should do more to win the game. 

'It’s mixed emotions at the end really. I’m proud of my player who fought very hard. We stuck to out tactical plan very well but in football it’s all about the result.’
