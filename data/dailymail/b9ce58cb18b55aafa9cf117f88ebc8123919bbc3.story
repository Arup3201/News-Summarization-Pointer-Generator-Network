Britain has been warned to brace itself for 'boats full of terrorists' if Islamist fanatics are allowed to cement their foothold in Libya.

Egypt's Ambassador to the UK said the flood of migrants from north Africa  poses a new threat now that the Islamic State controls the Libyan coastal town of Sirte.

Nasser Kamel's comments come after 2,164 migrants were rescued at sea in a 24-hour period over the weekend in what has been described as an 'exodus without precedent'.

He said: 'You know how far Sirte is from Italy? It's 300km. 

'Those boat people who go for immigration purposes and try to cross the Mediterranean... in the next few weeks, if we do not act together, they will be boats full of terrorists also.'

Mr Kamel also criticised Britain and other countries that intervened militarily in Libya in 2011 for not doing enough to help the transition from Colonel Gaddafi's dictatorship to a legitimate state.

He told BBC's Newsnight: 'I think after toppling Gaddafi, while no one is questioning that he was a dictator, we as an international community, especially those that intervened militarily, did not put enough resources (in) for developing a modern, democratic, Libyan state.

'I think we should have done more, the UN should have been more involved.'

He also called for the lifting of the UN arms embargo on the Libyan government to help it fight terrorism.

David Cameron today insisted he does not regret British efforts to oust Gaddafi despite the growing unrest and the threat from terrorists.

The Prime Minister added the UK would not abandon Libya as he maintained his decision to send British military forces to the north African country in 2011 was the 'right thing to do'.

Italy had yesterday also warned  to expect an exodus of migrants, with a heightened risk of jihadis 'slipping into Europe' after boarding boats crossing the Mediterranean.

Interior minister Angelino Alfano insisted the North African state was an 'absolute priority', warning there was 'not a minute to lose'. 

ISIS, which wants to include Italy as part of its so-called Caliphate, now controls a number of ports and there are fears that fighters could be on boats bound for southern Europe.

Mr Alfano added: 'If the militias of the Caliphate advance faster than the decisions of the international community how can we put out the fire in Libya and stem the migration flows? We are at risk of an exodus without precedent.'

Italy says there are about 600,000 migrants in Libya preparing to make the perilous sea crossing – a third of them in five camps along the coast.

Italian coastguards were also reportedly threatened during recent rescue operations when four armed men approached by speedboat from the Libyan coast.

Militants loyal to so-called Islamic State have heightened concerns they could establish a stronger presence in the area after they beheaded 21 hostages, who were all Coptic Christians from Egypt, on a Libyan beach.

It is feared the political uncertainty and violent power struggles in the north African country are the worst seen since Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011.

'Working for unity in Libya': David Cameron insisted he does not regret British efforts to oust Gaddafi despite the growing unrest and the threat from terrorists

Speaking in Hove, Mr Cameron told reporters: 'On the question of abandoning Libya, there's no question of Britain abandoning Libya.

'Britain is giving Libya support through our aid budget. We did a major training project for the Libyan security forces. We are doing work to try and bring together a national unity government in Libya.

'But of course what we face in Libya is a very difficult situation with far too many armed militias, without a proper government and with the growth of ungoverned space, and we've had the appalling events of the last few days with the brutal, senseless murders of Coptic Christians on the beach, which I know has shocked the whole world.

'I discussed it yesterday with the president of Egypt and what the whole world needs to do is come together and work for a Libya that has a national unity government, obviously excluding terrorists, and that can start to build the institutions of a state.

'Do I regret that Britain played our role in getting rid of Gaddafi and coming to the aid of that nation when Gaddafi was going to murder his own citizens in Benghazi? No I don't.

'It was the right thing for Britain to do. Gaddafi was no friend of our country - the Semtex given to the IRA has done a huge amount of damage in our country.

'Libya, Britain and the world are better off without Gaddafi but we have to do as much as we can now with, I hope, a willing Libyan population and politicians to try and bring that national unity government together - but it has been very hard work.'
