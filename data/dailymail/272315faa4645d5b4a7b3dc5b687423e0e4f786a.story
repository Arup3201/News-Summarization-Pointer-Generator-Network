Fit for fight: The Xtra Factor's Sarah-Jane Crawford has an online trainer

Former Radio 1 DJ Sarah-Jane Crawford is tuning up for her new role as presenter of  The Xtra Factor by pumping iron.

Busy Sarah-Jane, 29, has had no time to visit a personal trainer since being hired by Simon Cowell to host The X Factor’s sister show, so she’s using a web-based course from BodyBuilding.com.

She hopes to shed fat and develop lean arms and a six-pack, and tone her leg muscles in preparation for what will be her first TV role.

A friend said: ‘Sarah-Jane’s predecessor on The Xtra Factor, Caroline Flack, had great legs, so she feels under pressure.

'She’s always using the gym  of the hotels on tour.’

Forget Viagra – settling down and getting married might be the best way for men to  maintain their performance in the bedroom.

New research shows that those in a stable relationship were nearly 60 per cent less likely to suffer with erectile dysfunction.

In a study of 1,000 men, doctors  at Turku University Hospital in Finland quizzed them about rates of impotence, lifestyle and other  factors, and carried out a number of laboratory tests.

Results showed that 57 to 68 per cent of the men had problems maintaining an erection.

Smokers were at highest risk, with  41 per cent having problems.

Men in a stable relationship had a 57 per cent lower risk, and those who took part in high-intensity physical activity had a 50 per cent reduced risk.

Just how being in a stable relationship could have such an effect is not clear.

It has been suggested that marriage may provide an emotionally fulfilling, intimate relationship, which has an impact on physical and mental health.

Eating for two: Many new mothers have been found to have as much as 50lb during their pregnancy, when just a  25 to 35lb pound weight gain is believed to be necessary (stock image)

Despite government health warnings, pregnant women still gain twice the recommended amount of weight  during pregnancy – largely because many still believe the myth of ‘eating  for two’ and that exercise may be damaging to the unborn child.

Researchers, who interviewed expectant mothers, found many  gained as much as 50lb when just a  25 to 35lb pound weight gain is believed to be necessary.

Gestational weight gain can cause health problems for the mother and child and is thought to be a contributor to the rise in childhood obesity rates.

Dr Jennifer Kraschnewski, of Penn State College of Medicine in the US, who led the study said: ‘Excessive weight gain is a direct, although misguided, result of women’s concern to support a healthy pregnancy.

‘Pregnant women are focused on making sure they are eating enough, which is often too much, and avoiding exercise to protect the foetus.’
