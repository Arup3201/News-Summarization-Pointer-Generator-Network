It was only when I arrived in Jamaica with my girlfriend at the end of last year that I realised how tired I was. What a year!

After World Championship silver, two medals in the European Championships and my five medals in the Commonwealth Games, what more could I ask for?

It was great to round the year off with a fantastic holiday. Then, of course, there was Christmas. Thankfully, it wasn’t during competition period so I could eat as much turkey and stuffing as I wanted… within reason.

I've also been involved in some exciting events with my sponsors, who – like the National Lottery – have supported me a lot in my career.

Now, though, with the English and British Championships coming up next month, the hard work starts here.

I’m back in training, mostly working on new skills and stamina before I build up to routine work. It’s hard work and long hours, but I enjoy it. Plus, it’s essential if I’m going to beat my personal all-around best of 90.6 next month.

Getting to and from the gym is a lot more convenient since I moved to Basildon late last year – now it’s just a 10-minute drive, rather than an hour’s commute. I’m not quite an Essex boy just yet, though - still Hemel at heart!

The English and British Championships will be a great chance for me to test out some new routines. I’m feeling good about them at the moment, but I’ve still got a lot of work to do in the next few weeks. Hopefully I can pull it off.

I had a mixed time in my last competition – the World Championships in October. I had trouble at the beginning, and I think it was down to my mindset – I was taking it too seriously, rather than looking to enjoy the experience. I think, after having such a great year, I was putting to much emphasis on rounding it off as well as possible.

It was probably the steepest learning curve I’ve had in my career so far. Luckily, I got a second chance and refocused for the final to pick up a silver medal. But more importantly, it taught me a valuable lesson for the future. 

In total, Whitlock won five medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow
