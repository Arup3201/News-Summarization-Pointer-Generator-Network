David Luiz claims he snubbed a new deal at Chelsea to move to PSG - rubbishing claims by Jose Mourinho that he was not wanted at Stamford Bridge.

After Luiz left Chelsea in a £50million summer move, making him the world's most expensive defender, Mourinho said that the player was not first-choice at centre-back and was moving down the pecking order in central midfield.

The Portuguese also suggested the Blues are better off and a stronger club without the often-erratic Brazilian.

Results on the pitch this season would certainly corroborate that, with Chelsea top of the league and unbeaten in their opening nine games in all competitions, winning seven of those.

But Luiz claims: 'Chelsea offered me a new contract to stay but it was my choice to come here. I was happy with the plan PSG offered to me and I think it was exactly the right moment to move.

'I was so happy at Chelsea, I won two European titles and the FA Cup, it was great for me.

'I'm a lucky guy. I was playing for a big club like Chelsea and now I've got another opportunity to play for another big club. I'm enjoying it here.'

Luiz won the Europa League, Champions League and the FA Cup before Mourinho returned for his second spell at Stamford Bridge in 2012. But he made just 15 Premier League appearances last year as he slipped out of favour.

Following his departure, Mourinho said: 'Last season he was not regular first-choice for us. David did important things here, was always a good professional and we will miss him as a good guy when he was with us. But from a football point of view we believe our squad is stronger this season than it was.

'As a central defender he was not at all first-choice, it was John Terry and Gary Cahill during the whole season. In midfield he was a physical guy and gave us some important things, especially when we played in the Champions League when Nemanja Matic couldn’t play.

'But this season Matic can play in the Champions League so we don’t lose that physicality. The fact we also have Cesc Fabregas moves us in a different direction and we want to move in a different direction. It’s something that our football needs and we want to go in that direction.'

Luiz has got off to a mixed start with his new club. They recorded a fine 3-2 win against Barcelona in the Champions League last week, in which the Brazilian scored his first goal for the club.

But in the French Ligue 1 they are in fourth place, already seven points behind Marseille at the top.

Luiz maintains that he has no regrets about leaving Chelsea and is confident he can win the Champions League at his new club.

'This is the plan we have,' he added. 'We have great players, a great coach and it's a great club. It's so difficult to win the Champions League, you have to win game by game. You need to qualify first if you want to win.

'I made my choice and I'm happy with my choice. I'm happy to see my friends at Chelsea playing very well, and I'm happy to be here.'
