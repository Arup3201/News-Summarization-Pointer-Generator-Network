Peter Crouch had a hand in three of the four goals as Stoke City drew 2-2 with QPR at Loftus Road.

Mame Biram Diouf opened the scoring with his second Premier League goal of the season. Peter Crouch beat Rio Ferdinand in the air to provide the perfect knock-down for the former Manchester united forward to head home from close range. Steven Caulker's header was then prodded past a helpless Asmir Begovic by Crouch just before the break.

But the colossal striker redeemed himself as he evaded Ferdinand in the box to sweep home a Victor Moses cross and restore the visitors' lead. Harry Redknapp's side appeared to be heading for a draw before Niko Kranjcar equalised with a brilliant late free-kick.

Well that was an entertaining affair with a thrilling finale in front of 16, 163 fans.

On the evidence of that match, I think it's safe to say Stoke have gone a long way from dispelling their 'long-ball' style of play with Victor Moses standing out for the hosts.For QPR, Harry Redknapp will be pleased his side managed to come back twice into the game after falling behind.That's all from me, but be sure to follow the rest of the Premier League action with Dan Ripley by CLICKING HERE.

The full-time whistle blows on an entertaining affair here at Loftus Road. QPR's Niko Kranjcar beautiful free-kick in the 88th minute means both sides share the spoils in West London. The hosts will be pleased that they managed to salvage something from the game, but Stoke will be ruing their missed chances in a match they should have won.

Stoke's second goalscorer Peter Crouch has been named as the man-of-the-match for today's game.

What. A. Goal. Kranjcar is chopped down on the edge of the box by Steve Sidwell - who receives a yellow card for his sins. Kranjcar picks himself up and curls home a majestic free-kick that sails into the top right-hand corner. We have four minutes of injury-time left. Game on!

From the following free-kick Leroy Fer goes close to scoring but sees his header tipped round the post by Asmir Begovic. We have less than five minutes plus injury time remaining.

Ryan Shawcross receives a yellow card for a hefty foul on Niko Kranjcar joining team-mates Mame Biram Diouf, Erik Pieters and QPR's Armand Traore in the book.Leroy Fer also collects a caution for his protestations about Shawcross' tackle.

We've got 10 minutes left... can QPR find a way to equalise?

QPR will be blowing a sigh of relief as Stoke boss Mark Hughes substitutes Victor Moses for Marko Arnautovic. Moses has been brilliant for the visitors and the travelling fans recognised this with a standing ovation.

Stoke hold the unwanted record of being the team last on Match Of The Day the highest number of times. But they're doing their best to ensure a shake up in the running order this week. They've played exciting counter-attacking football. QPR on top at the moment, though and Stoke will be hoping they're not left to rue missed chances.

Both sides make a change with 20 minutes left plus injury time left. Eduardo Vargas home debut comes to end as he is replaced by Bobby Zamora while Steve Sidwell has come on for Charlie Adam.

QPR are trying to increase the pressure again, just like during the first-half, but Stoke are looking very comfortable and very good value for their lead.

Stoke are currently running riot at Loftus Road and should be 3-1 up. Charlie Adam is found in acres of space inside the QPR box and pulls the ball back into the path of Steven Nzonzi who blazes high and wide. Will they rue these missed chances?

Victor Moses deserves most of the credit for this goal. The Nigeria international wins the ball from Mauricio Isla before getting to the byline and firing a low cross into the path of Crouch who emphatically finds the net with an expert left-footed shot.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp has been forced to make another change once more with Jordon Mutch the latest player to injure his hamstring. Karl Henry his replacement.

Should Steven Caulker's goal be credited to him? The centre back's header was on-target but Peter Crouch kicked the ball into his own net? It's one for the dubious goals panel that's for sure...

We're back underway at Loftus Road...

QPR lucky to go into the second half equal with Stoke. The Potters had chances to extend their lead before that equaliser so no wonder Mark Hughes was letting the expletives fly. Peter Crouch been decisive at both goal mouths, assisting the opener but then helping Steven Caulker's header into the net. QPR probably need to improve in the second half if they are to get anything from this match. 

Steven Caulker's goal has levelled matters at Loftus Road. The visitors will feel the scoreline doesn't reflect the balance of play though, with the Potters being hugely impressive on the counter-attack.

We're all square in West London! Jordon Mutch wins his side a corner. From the ensuing set-piece Steven Caulker heads home at the back post to the eruption at Loftus Road. There's some controversy over the goalscorer though with Crouch inadvertently getting the final touch. 

QPR midfielder Joey Barton's afternoon is over after tweaking his hamstring once more. Matt Phillips come on as his replacement.

Peter Crouch is appearing in the groove against his former side, seeing his low right-footed shot fly past the post after great play again by Victor Moses.QPR immediately go up the other end and Niko Kranjcar hits a 25-yard drive that goes inches past the post.

Half an hour played and the game has been an entertaining affair. Stoke are soaking up the QPR pressure and hitting the hosts on the counter-attack on numerous occasions.

Despite their increased pressure, Stoke are looking increasingly threatening on the counter-attack. Diouf dwindling on the ball when the visitors breaking this time.

Victor Moses wreaking havoc down the wing, good to see the youngster in such good form. Peter Crouch all over former England teammate Rio Ferdinand at the moment, out sprinting him just minutes before rising above him for the header to assist the goal. Meanwhile Stoke fans taunt the home support - 'is this a library?'  

The hosts have come back into the game since going a goal behind but have yet to trouble Begovic sufficiently.

Stoke are close to doubling their lead soon after but Victor Moses has his stinging shot saved by Green.

Peter Crouch 2-0 Rio Ferdinand. After blitzing Ferdinand moments before, Crouch beats the centre-back in the air to nod down for Mame Biram Diouf to score past Rob Green in the QPR goal.

Rio Ferdinand's diminishing pace has been spoken a lot and it was on evidence after eight minutes when Peter Crouch, not known for his speed, glides past the former England defender before over-hitting a cross out for a goal kick.

Mark Hughes gets his first taste of the Loftus Road faithful's views on him, with the crowd chanting 'Stand up if you hate Mark Hughes!'Two years on since his sacking in 2012 and the wounds still haven't been healed it seems.

Vargas has the first shot on goal after 54 seconds but his tame strike is comfortably gathered by Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal.

QPR's Vargas and Charlie Austin get proceedings started...

The last time both QPR and Stoke were in the Premier League, the Potters completed a double over the West London outfit. Victory today would see them achieve three wins in a row against the R's for the first time since 1974.

The hosts have played one and lost one at home so far this season, but hold an impressive record against their opponents at Loftus Road.

Harry Redknapp's side have won eight and lost just two of their last 13 home league games against the Potters (D3)

Ever wondered what a Premier League footballer's matchday routine is before kick-off? QPR revealed earlier on their official Twitter account, what the professionals entail in the countdown to the match. (Note: The referee's coin toss happens precisely 80 seconds before the game begins...)

QPR fans will get their first chance to see on loan signing Eduardo Vargas at Loftus Road today following his summer move from Italian side Napoli. The 24-year-old was one of Chile's stars at the World Cup and the home fans will be hoping he can repeat that form as they bid to avoid relegation this season.

Plenty of fans crowded the entrance to Loftus Road waiting for the players buses to arrive. Former manager Mark Hughes, returning here for the first time since he was sacked by Tony Fernandes in 2012, got plenty of stick. He's about as welcome in this part of West London as John Terry, or rickets (the disease, not Michael). Some QPR fans perceive the financial and confidence problems the club currently faces as being a hangover from Hughes's 10 month stint here.  

Stoke have been dealt a blow with news that Jonathan Walters is unavailable for selection having failed to overcome a calf injury.

Stoke forward Jon Walters (calf) misses the clash but midfielder Marko Arnautovic (foot) is fit enough to be named on the bench.
