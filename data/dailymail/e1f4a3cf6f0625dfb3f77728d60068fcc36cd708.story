A band of four impossibly cute Cotton-top Tamarin brothers have moved into Sydney's Taronga Zoo

And the highly social primates, which are easily recognised by their long white 'punk like' sagittal crests extending from their foreheads to their shoulders, are said to be 'very cheeky'.

The small New World monkeys have settled into their new home from Mogo Zoo, on the south coast of New South Wales, and are sure to be a star attraction in the state's capital.

Keeper Kristal Thomson said the four brothers all have different personalities and research has indeed shown that Cotton-tops display both altruistic and spiteful behaviours.

The species, which is found in tropical forests in north-west Colombia, eat insects and plants in the wild and play an important role as seed dispersers in the tropical ecosystem. In their new abode, the brothers will also get to feast on bugs, fruit and flowers.

The little monkeys are a critically endangered species, having been threatened by both the illegal pet trade and deforestation in Colombia, where it is thought only about 6000 remain. Â 

Flower-loving: The Cotton-Top Tamarin, a small New World monkey weighing less than 0.5 kg, is making itself at home at Sydney's Taronga Zoo

Punks: The primates are easily recognised by their long white sagittal crests extending from their foreheads to their shoulders

Tasting: The monkeys try out the local cuisine their new home has to offer - two bright coloured flowers, that they would also find in the rainforest

Monkeying around: One Cotton-top appears to look into the camera with his brown eyes

He's my brother: It is hard to tell the four monkeys apart with their matching brown, white and black colours

Unique: Keeper Kristal Thomson said the four brothers do all have different personalities. This cheeky one appears to be sticking his tongue out

No Hands: When standing, it is clear to see how small the little monkeys actually are

What's this? A Cotton-Top inspects his dinner before tucking in to the red petal

Tasty: The primate sticks out his tiny pink tongue as he munches on a plant

Don't talk to me: The cute monkeys appear displeased with each other as they sit on a tree branch munching on their food

Settling in: Keeper Kristal Thomson feeds the Cotton-tops at their new home at Taronga Zoo
