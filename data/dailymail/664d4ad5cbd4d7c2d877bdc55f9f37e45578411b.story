When seven people got free meals at a Cardiff diner by completing its challenge of eating a 69oz mixed grill in only one hour - the owner decided to beef up his menu to defeat his customers.

Restaurant boss Paul Stevens has created an entire menu of 40 different Man Vs Food mega-meals.

Father of one Mr Stevens, 53, beefed up his Desperate Dan-style cuisine to include a giant 96oz rump steak, a 6 ½ pound ‘baby’ burger weighing more than a sack of potatos, ‘suicide’ chicken wings covered in hot chilli sauce and a selection of giant desserts.

Filling: The diner's pancake stack wouldn't leave you much room for seconds

Hunger game: The two-foot-long Po Boy, which comes with a meat or fish option

He even serves up scorpion, ants, meal worms and Kangaroo testicles.

Inspired by the U.S television programme Man vs Food, Paul, he claims to have the only restaurants in Britain providing an entire menu catering for food challenges. He has even bought the brand name Man vs Food Limited.

Twenty stone Mr Stevens, who runs Sizzle And Grill in Cardiff, South Wales, said: ‘We don’t think anything on our menu is weird - we just started to introduce a cow pie that the Dandy character Desperate Dan eats and we have a proper bowl which is two-foot in diameter.

‘What we do know that it is very rare to have a whole menu dedicated to Man vs Food challenges.

The only thing we do not do is starters because that would be too much.

‘We even cater to vegetarians and have a Kids vs Food challenge. There is an even sign outside that says our place is ‘the home of Man vs Food'.

‘One party pre-ordered our suicide wings and I made them aware of how hot they were - but they added another ten portions. The more you tell them not to do it, the more they want to.

‘I am not sure why I do it. It is certainly fun watching people do them but it is also heart breaking as well. Sometimes people get 45 minutes into a challenge and it looks like they are going to do it but then they hit the wall.

‘One guy had 15 minutes left and about 2 bites left. He just could not do it and it would have saved him £60.’

Mr Steven's 69oz mixed grill challenge consists of a steak, two pieces of gammon, five pork chops, half a chicken, four sausages, two eggs, mushrooms, peas, a side salad and a bowl of chips. But amazingly one diner managed to complete the meal in 22 minutes.

The menu has since progressed to include dishes such as a £29.99 Orgasma Burger; a tower of five steak burgers, five chicken burgers, with 15 other layers of salad, onion rings, chillies, mushrooms and ham.

All the burgers, bought from the butchers next door to the restaurant are freshly made daily with a mixture of minced steak, cracked black pepper, caramelised onion and no other additives.

The Po boy - a two-feet long sandwich - comes in meat or fish whilst diners have the chance to down 75 chicken wings in 30 minutes or a giant sausage sandwich called The Widowmaker.

Desserts include a six litre bucket of ice cream and a giant banana split featuring six bananas. So far the cooked-to-order 96oz steak at £69.00 and the £34.99 6 ½ pound double cheese Baby Burger are to yet be eaten within an hour.

Orgasma Calories: 12,000Ingredients: A tower of five Steak Burgers, five chicken burgers, cheese slices,  lettuce, tomatoes, onion rings, bacon, thinly sliced ham, a few chillies, mushrooms, side salad all in a warm ciabatta bun and chips. 

Mixed grill Calories: 4,000Ingredients: A steak, two pieces of gammon, five pork
 chops, half a chicken, four sausages, two eggs, mushrooms, peas, a side
 salad and a bowl of chips

Po Boy Calories: 3,700 Ingredients for meat option: A two-foot sandwich with melted cheese top and bottom filled with lettuce leaves, spicy slaw, layer of ham, mixed peppers, grated cheese, sliced steak, and mushrooms and topped with a sticky barbeque sauce, served on large plank with a bowl of chips. Fish option: A two-foot sandwich with melted cheese top and bottom filled with lettuce leaves, spicy slaw, battered calamari rings, wait bait, crayfish and prawns, and topped with a seafood sauce, served on a plank with a bowl of chips.

The King Wing Challenge is another that has defeated customers.

Mr Stevens added: ‘The 69oz mixed grill was probably one of the hardest challenges but although I sold nearly 3000, seven people completed it in the hour set - the quickest in 22 minutes.’

‘I myself cannot get near those meals. I am quite a large person myself and we have found that it’s the slight people who can complete the challenges. The large people just can’t do it.

‘Apparently there is scientific reason for that. Fat people have more fat so their stomach cannot grow and expand more. I don’t know if that is true.

‘We do a lot of stag parties and team bonding exercises coming from all over the place. More and more parties are coming in to attempt the challenges together. A dozen will try the challenge and of course the rest of the party are egging them on.

‘Obviously it is very noisy. We are now doing less regular steak meals because if you have a group in attempting a challenge, screaming and shouting at one end and you have a table of two next to them making eyes at each other. It doesn’t work and so we have had to change our menu because of it.’

Along with giant portions, the 54 -over restaurant also offers a selection of creepy crawly delights and exotic food challenges.

Mr Stevens said: ‘We found that exotic meats are getting very popular with crocodile, kangaroo, ostrich, zebra and python often chosen. We also serve ants. We are getting really busy with the ants.

'Stags really like them. Scorpions, ants, and meal worm, all are kept in the fridge at the back so as not to scare the children.

‘Last week a customer asked for Gerbil as apparently it is a delicacy in Peru. We didn’t do it however because it would be too hard to come by and I think quite a lot of people might be disgusted by it.

‘People often question me about it not being healthy. It probably doesn’t help that we do a Kids vs Food Challenge too as we do a lot of children’s parties. We do get a lot of abuse for it but we just want to cater for everyone.

‘Our Po Boy can be done with quorn so it will cater for vegetarians. We wouldn’t turn anyone away. Now and then someone will come in and they will say "you should not be doing that". We just say "it’s the customer’s decision and we don’t force anyone to eat anything".

‘We are a little bit different from other places that do these challenges as we use quality food. What we have found is that if customers do not eat it all we are asked to put it in a doggy bag. If it wasn’t of good quality why would they take it home?'

The Kids vs Food challenge consists of a milder version of the adult ghost chilli Suicide Wing Challenge, a small hot dog and four two oz burgers, which they call a Quadruple Bypass.

Seven Suicide wings are laced with Naga Bhut Jolokia in a smokey paprika and honey sauce measuring a stagger 1,578,548 in Scoville heat units.

Tabasco Red Pepper sauce registers at 2,500 Scoville units on the scale invented by American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville in 1912.
