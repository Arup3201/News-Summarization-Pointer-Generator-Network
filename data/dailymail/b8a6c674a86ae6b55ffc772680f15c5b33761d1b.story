It is a haunting scene which could have come straight from a Hollywood film set - a lone female protester stands clutching a crucifix against a desolate backdrop of burning caravans and smouldering embers.

But the carefully-crafted image at Dale Farm is not all that it seems – far from it.

For the woman in the picture is not even one of the travellers who had vowed to ‘fight to the death’ for their homes. Despite this, she has made it onto the front pages of the majority of national newspapers.

Not even a traveller: Minty Challis holds aloft a crucifix at the Dale Farm site amid the burning rubble. She's a regular at the site for three years in the lead up to the eviction at the illegal camp

She is actually an agitprop activist who
hurries to join anarchist groups wherever they are gathered.

Yesterday 
45-year-old Minty Challis was at Britain’s biggest illegal travellers’ 
site likening the plight of its inhabitants to the suffering of the 
Palestinians in Gaza.

Her devotion to the cause is plain for all to see - indeed her zealous belief in trying to save the site from the bailiffs is so strong that it has brought her into conflict with her fellow activists.

During meetings around the camp fire in the weeks before the final showdown, she would often interrupt a speaker to insist her point was heard.

‘We love her desire to help the travellers, but sometimes we need a break from her because she can be a pain in the neck,’ said one protester.

Miss Challis’s activism was borne out of a troubled childhood characterised not by idealism but by violence.

Growing up on the streets of Notting Hill in West London in the 1970s, raised by a mother and stepfathers, she joined one of the capital’s first girl gangs, called The Wall. At 13, she was ‘locked up’ in a Government assessment centre for two years and then lived on the streets for another eight years.

After moving to Catford in south-east London, she became an active member of the anarchist group Reclaim the Streets, which campaigns against globalisation by holding impromptu parties on major roads to cause disruption.

Miss Challis, whose real name is believed to be Donna Berry, then turned her attention to trying to stop child abuse and gang culture. She regularly appears in her local paper trying to drum up support for her latest campaign and has spoken at numerous demonstrations.

The activist’s three current campaign groups are the ‘Anti Child Abuse Liberation Front’, the ‘South London Ceasefire Crew’ and the ‘Stop the Killing Crew’.

Her recent internet posts reveal the extent of her anti-capitalist and anarchist credentials. In one post she wrote: ‘Are you ready for the revolution’.

And when she became aware of the issues surrounding Dale Farm, Miss Challis was quick to get on board.

The professional activist, who also calls herself Minty Militant Charmer Challis, first started visiting Europe’s largest traveller site three years ago. She claims she is directly related to some of the travellers on Dale Farm.

During interviews yesterday, Miss Challis was keen to describe the suffering of the travellers. ‘There is a lot of police brutality going on,’ she declared.

She claimed a woman traveller’s back had been broken by the police when they stormed the compound.

Officials said the woman had in fact been admitted to hospital with minor spinal discomfort.
