The manufacturer of DuoMax claims it is the only product in the world which can kill Ebola without damaging the human skin or being toxic to the body in anyway

A British firm which claims it makes the only chemical spray which can safely kill the Ebola virus says it has been swamped with orders.

The manufacturer of DuoMax maintains it is the only product in the world which can kill Ebola without damaging the human skin or being toxic to the body in anyway.

Because it is non-toxic, it can apparently be used to treat large areas as it does not irritate the skin and eyes like bleach or chlorine products

The company claims DuoMax does not break down human skin like other corrosive chemicals, which makes it susceptible to infection.

Instead, it's claimed it effectively kills the virus and also stops it from spreading.

The website claims the spray destroys the DNA and RNA which doesn’t allow the pathogen to reproduce or replicate. This also significantly reduces the risk of cross contamination.

The chemical can be used in both cleaning products and disinfectants to stop Ebola and is already being used by Heathrow Airport, it is claimed.

It comes as UK airports are stepping up their efforts to prevent the disease entering the UK, with both Heathrow and Gatwick screening for the disease.

Brian Baker, founder of Bristol-based DuoMax, said the company is now in discussion with officials abroad as the global fight against the disease steps up.

He said: 'We are talking to other companies in America who want to licence the product. it just has to get EPA approval first, but that is being fast-tracked for humanitarian reasons.

'We are also in contact with people in Africa are happy to send the product over for free in order to help.

'We're not providing a cure for Ebola but this is life saving and preventative technology which is currently the only form of protection.' 

Ebola is a spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or vomit from someone infected, meaning that any liquid left on a surface could potential lead to infection.

It is so devastating that 70 per cent of cases result in death, with more than 4,500 people having already died. 

Mr Baker added that DuoMax could be another weapon in the fight against the disease and used as an alternative to other, more harmful chemicals. 

'In these circumstances the use of bleach or high-chlorine based products can be extremely dangerous as they are corrosive, toxic and an irritant if in contact with skin.

The company's website states: 

On contact, DuoMax pierces the outer membrane of the pathogen and dismantles and destroys the DNA and RNA which eliminates the risk of pathogens developing resistance to the product. 

Alcohol only denatures the external membrane protein which does not kill the pathogen but only temporarily disables them, allowing it to regenerate with increased strength.

By removing the protein, DuoMax not only kills the bacteria, but any odour will also be removed. 

'This could itself create a situation in which the Ebola virus can enter the human body.

'DuoMax is completely non-toxic and non-irritant so we can use it in anything from hand sanitisers to mist sprays, which coat entire areas within buildings and prevent possible spread of the virus.'

He added the chemical has already undergone extensive testing by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service at BlueTest Laboratories in Glasgow. 

But Paul Hunter, Professor of Health Protection at the University of East Anglia, said: 'I am sure this product will kill Ebola, but then so will almost all other disinfectants, including chlorine. 

'The issue is whether the use of this disinfectant has advantages over chlorine in the real world?' 

Another scientist, who did not wish to be named, told MailOnline: 'A number of disinfectants have been shown to be effective disinfectants against Ebola virus - these include soap and water and bleach. 

'Also, none of these disinfectants can be used to treat patients, and nor can the product highlighted on the website.'

'The individuals who have been listed as testing DuoMax would not have tested the product directly on Ebolavirus. 

'Suffice to say I don’t doubt that the product would work, but needless to say that the take-home message is that any disinfectant shown to work against envelope viruses will be effective. 

'Ebolavirus isn’t particularly hardy out in the environment - in fact sunlight is likely to rapidly kill it.'
