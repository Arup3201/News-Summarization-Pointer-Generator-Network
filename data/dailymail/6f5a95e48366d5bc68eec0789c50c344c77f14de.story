Whether in the crystal clear waters of the Caribbean or off the coast of Australia and Tasmania, some of the world's most beautiful oceans also contain the world's most nightmare-inducing creatures. 

Often dwelling at the bottom of the sea and rarely seen by humans, Distractify compiled a list of the creepiest underwater animals around.

Behold the best of the bunch and good luck getting into the water after this.

The world's most gorgeous oceans also contain the world's most creepy underwater creatures 

The goblin shark is a deep-sea dwelling animal with a whole lot of very sharp teeth. 

Thankfully, it poses no threat to humans as it mostly eats bottom-feeding fish.

While very little is known about the elusive creature, it is believed to have a wide global distribution having been spotted everywhere from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan. 

Distractify has compiled the most nightmare-inducing deep-sea dwellers. Here: the sarcastic fringehead

The sarcastic fringehead may have a chuckle-inducing name, but this tiny, ferocious fish is no joke.

Known for its large mouth and territorial behaviour, they are ambush feeders and aggressively attack their prey - usually crustaceans.

They are native to Southern California and Baja, Mexico.   

The water bear is one of the toughest creatures on Earth and is able to survive extreme environments

Good luck ever being able to close your eyes again after getting a glimpse of the world's toughest creature: the water bear (or tardigrade).

The water-dwelling micro-animals are classified as extremophiles, which means that they can thrive in an environment that would be detrimental to most life on Earth.

No wonder they can live for up to 200 years and survive trips to space.

Spider crabs, which are native to the UK, are covered in spikes and have 10 legs

The spider crab is one unusual looking creature. 

It's body is covered in spikes and along with its eight walking legs, it also has two longer clawed arms.

Most often, they are found in course sand and bedrock along the UK's southern and western coasts.  

The Bobbit worm can grow up to sizes of nearly 3m long, though the average remains 1m

Found in warmer oceans, the Bobbit worm can grow to sizes of nearly 3m (9.8 ft) long - although the average remains around 1m (3 ft). 

The creature catches its food by burying its long body into an ocean bed composed of gravel and mud, waiting for one of its five antennae to sense prey.

Due to its sharp teeth and speed of attack, sometimes its prey is sliced in half in the process. 

The Mola mola is the world's heaviest bony fish and weighs up to 1,000 kg

The Mola mola is the heaviest known bony fish in the world with an average adult weight of 1,000 kg. 

An ocean sunfish, the species is native to temperate and tropical waters.

Though they may be absolutely massive, these docile creatures eat a diet almost solely comprised of jellyfish and pose no threat to humans whatsoever.

While the rainbow eel may look pretty, the creature can be quite aggressive when called for

The red-lipped batfish is one of the strangest underwater creatures - it can walk on the ocean floor

While both the colourful ribbon eel and red-lipped batfish may look beautiful, you definitely don't want to get too close.

These eels can change colour and sex during their life and grow to be 1.3m long.

As far as the batfish, their pectoral fins actually allow them to walk on the ocean floor. 

It's found in deep waters off the Galapagos Islands. 

Blobfish live off the coast of Australia and Tasmania and are very rarely seen by humans - thankfully!

You can't un-see this haunting creature!

The blobfish lives off the coasts of mainland Australia and Tasmania.

Rarely seen by humans, they usually live at depths between 600 and 1200m.

Get a glimpse into the mind of the barreleye - literally! It's head is transparent and brains visible to all

Last but certainly not least: the barreleye, which is also known as the spook fish.

Named for their large, protruding, barrel-shaped eyes, the four-eyed fish has a transparent head - meaning you can see it's brain, as well.
