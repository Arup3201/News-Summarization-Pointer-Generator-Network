A 54-year-old military academy teacher had sex with a 15-year-old student and 'married' her after they exchanged rings and vows, he has allegedly told detectives.

Duane Ernest Adams, a retired U.S. Army sergeant and a Russian teacher at Francis Military Academy in Ocala, Florida, told detectives that he loves the girl and that their marriage is true in the eyes of God.

Adams, who is divorced, was initially arrested for interfering with custody of a child on Tuesday - after allegedly helping her when she ran away from home last week - but was rearrested on Wednesday.

He now faces eight counts of sexual battery custodial, eight counts of lewd and lascivious exhibition and eight counts of lewd and lascivious molestation,the Ocala Star Banner reported.

Arrest: Duane Adams, 54, allegedly had sex with a 15-year-old student. This week he allegedly visited her after she had run away from home - even though he told cops he did not know where she was

When the Russian and sports teacher was being hauled from the police department in cuffs, he told a Star Banner reporter that he was being arrested for having sex with a 15-year-old girl.

He admitted to the reporter that he got 'caught up with something I shouldn't have done'.

On Adams' Facebook page, it states in December that he is 'In a Relationship'.

The paper reported that he also told a
 detective that he was waiting until the girl turned 16 so they could 
run away to different state and get married.

The girl reportedly told the detective that they had been dating for about six months, and in that time, he has touched her and she has performed sex acts on him at his apartment. She told the detective that, after running away from home on Friday and going to Daytona, she had sex with Adams.

The arrest came after the girl was reported as a runaway by her parents on Friday. Just before she was reported missing, Adams had arrived to pick her up, but her mother had sent him away.

When police contacted him - as well as other staff members - over the weekend, Adams said he did not know where the girl was or how to contact her.

But when the girl was found in front of a restaurant on Monday, she said she and a friend had run away, and that Adams had joined them in Daytona.

He later left but returned and took her to a small rented cabin in Ocala, she said.

When
 interviewed by detectives on Tuesday, Adams admitted that he had met 
the girl in Daytona on Friday afternoon and that he had paid for a hotel
 room - using a fake name and cash.

Adams said he had nothing to say to the victim's family.

Col. William Archibald, director 
of Francis Military Academy, said he was 'absolutely appalled' by the 
allegations against Adams, who has been suspended without pay.

'We can't have him back,' said Archibald. 'We're all beside ourselves at the academy.'

His bond has been set at $176,000.
