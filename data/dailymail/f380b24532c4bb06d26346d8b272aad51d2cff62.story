As a former winner of Celebrity Masterchef and with her own cookery book to her name, TV star Nadia Sawalha's passion for good food is well-documented.

Now the 48-year-old, who had crept up to a dress size 18 three years ago, has told how she managed to slim down to a shapely size 12 without succumbing to a 'depressing' fat-free diet or even forgoing her beloved wine and cream cakes.

Thanks to simply cutting out snacking and taking a more calorie-conscious approach to cooking, the presenter has gone from struggling to look at herself in the mirror, to being snapped up as the confident and curvaceous star of Bonmarche's latest ad campaign.

'My philosophy is that you shouldn't go without anything,' she told The Mirror.

But three years ago the 5ft6in TV presenter decided it was time to take action when her weight hit 13stone.

Body confident: Nadia - who has fluctuated between a dress size 8 and 18 - says she feels comfortable and confident as a size 12

'I was in denial about how big I was - I couldn't look at myself straight on in mirrors and whenever I appeared on TV I was always the biggest,' said the former Loose Women panellist, who said by the time her family sat down to eat the meals she prepared for them she was already full from grazing on the wrong type of foods.

Instead of cutting out all the foods she enjoys in favour of low-fat options, Nadia made sure to only eat when she was hungry, and measured out the oil she used in cooking with a spoon rather than pouring it freely into the pan.

'I cooked the same things, I just tried to cut the calories,' she said.

'Flattering': Nadia models a wine velvet sleeveless dress, left, £35, and a David Emanuel rose printed blouse, £15, and black trousers, £19.50, right, all from Bonmarche

Introducing exercise into her daily 
routine also helped to transform the star into the happy and healthy 
size 12 vision that caught the attention of Bonmarche.

'When my agent called and said I'd 
been asked to be the face of Bonmarche my first question was what size 
do they want me to be - when he replied "they haven't asked what size 
you are they just want you", I could have cried,' she said.

'Having been every size in the past 
from an 8 to an 18 and now finally being happy in my skin at size 12 - 
which is the right size for me long term - to actually be modelling at 
the grand old age of 48 seemed crazy. But I'm absolutely thrilled to 
bits and I love all the clothes, which are cut to fit and flatter the 
female form.'

'Bonmarché 
loves bums and boobs which is perfect for me because I love being a 
woman with curves but still taking care of my diet and body so I can be 
fit and healthy for my family - right now I'm having the time of my 
life,' she said.
