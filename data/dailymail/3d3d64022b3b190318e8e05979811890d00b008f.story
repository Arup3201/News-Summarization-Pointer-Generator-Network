Killer: Ian Huntley poses outside his home before being arrested by police

The brother of Soham murderer Ian Huntley has spoken for the first time about his evil sibling and how he hates the child killer.

Wayne Huntley said: 'I don't want him around...I wish he was dead.'

He has laid bare the sickening truth about his brother who murdered 10-year-old Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham, Cambridgeshire in August, 2002.

In his book, The Blood We Share, Wayne tells how:

The book details how the family gathered for a showdown with Huntley 12 days after Holly and Jessica vanished on August 4, 2002 while going to buy sweets.

Huntley, the Soham school caretaker, had made a late-night call to his mother Lynda from a hotel on the outskirts of Cambridgeshire where police had put him after questioning him about the girls' disappearance.

She asked Huntley: 'Did you do it?' Her heart sank when he replied: ' I love you mum.' It was was at that moment that she knew her son was guilty, according to Wayne who had been present during the call.

Wayne and his father Kevin picked up Huntley from the hotel and brought him back to the family home in Littleport eight miles away. Lynda burst into tears when she saw her son who looked haggard after hours of police questioning.

She embraced Huntley, but, Wayne revealed, his brother stood in front of her with his arms down and would not hug her.

Lynda recalled in a subsequent interview with police that her son said to her: 'You do know I love you don't you?' I said, 'I love you, too, son.'

The family spent the next few hours trying to coax a confession from Huntley but he refused to say anything except: 'They're gonna arrest me.'

Five hours after Huntley called his mother, police in four cars arrived at the family's bungalow, but mistakenly grabbed Wayne and twisted his arm behind his back.

Finally, Huntley was arrested and handcuffed while sitting in a chair in the front room. The family then had to leave the house as officers sealed it off as a crime scene.

In the book - being serialised in the Sun - Wayne told of the cushy prison life enjoyed by Huntley who has been imprisoned since 2003.

He has cookery classes with other inmates and is allowed to buy ingredients and then cook a meal which they all share - including pizzas and on one occasion steak.

The killer watches his favourite team,Manchester United, on television seemingly unmoved by the shocking connection with his victims.

Huntley once boasted to his brother during a visit that notorious prison hard man Charles Bronson was in the next room.

But Wayne is convinced his brother is still haunted by his crimes and will commit suicide rather than spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Guilty: Ian Huntley's girlfriend Maxine Carr gave him a false alibi

Huntley has twice tried to kill himself with an overdose and had his throat slashed by another inmate in his cell in march, 2010.

Wayne told the Sun: 'I know he will try to kill himself again, but I don't think he should be able to do it. he deserves to feel the pain and fear he inflicted on those girls.

'Every day he deserves to think about what he has done'.

At his trial Huntley claimed he accidentally killed the girls at his house. HisÂ  girlfriend Maxine Carr was jailed for 21 months for giving him a false alibi.

Wayne, from Reading Berkshire, claimed Huntley faked mental problems when he was arrested - but his brother easily beat him at chess and table tennis during jail visits before his trial.

He believed Huntley's behaviour was just a charade to fool the court. ' 'I'm just thankful his trickery never paid off, ' he said.
