A Maine man accused of sending poison to a depressed Englishman who used it to kill himself is headed for a bail hearing.

Kilmartin, of Windham, has pleaded not guilty to mailing injurious articles and mailing injurious articles resulting in death.

He could face a maximum sentence of life in prison if he is convicted.

Authorities haven't said how Kilmartin obtained the poison or how he and Denton initially found each other.

Monday's hearing initially was scheduled to take place in November but it was postponed.

The Portland Press Herald reports that an investigation released by English police says Sidney Kilmartin, of Windham, Maine, and Andrew Denton of Hull, England, exchanged emails in which Kilmartin offered to sell Denton potassium cyanide and gave him advice on how to use it.

Police say Denton was found dead in December 2012. 

Over 18 months, officers were able to track the mail order down to Kilmartin's home in the town of Windham, near Portland.

Potassium cyanide is a highly toxic, colorless salt often used in gold mining and electroplating. Exposure to it can result in rapid death.

The court papers say Kilmartin, who lived in South Windham, posted the poison 'with the intent to kill or injure another.'

Officers are said to be in the dark as to how Kilmartin came into possession of the deadly cyanide, as he is not thought to have worked in industries where the product was used.

Kilmartin could have faced the death penalty if convicted, but U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder intervened and declined to seek it in this case, the Portland Press Herald reported.

At the court hearing, Kilmartin's attorney, Jeffrey Silverstein, asked that a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity be recorded.

At Mr Denton’s inquest in Hull, the coroner’s court was told that remnants of potassium cyanide had been found at his home.

The toxicology report confirmed that he had died from cyanide poisoning.
