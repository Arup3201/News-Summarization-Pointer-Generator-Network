David Miliband today admitted he can 'never erase' the memory of losing against his brother in their bitter struggle for the Labour leadership three years ago.

But the former foreign secretary added his relationship with younger brother Ed is 'healing' and there was no point 'looking in the rear view mirror'.

The ex-MP spoke candidly to veteran broadcaster Andrew Marr, who returned to his BBC show on Sunday, just six months after suffering a stroke.

The interview was Mr Miliband's last before he moves to New York to head up the International Rescue Committee charity.

Although he did not completely rule out a comeback, he added that leaving British politics would ensure an end to the 'soap opera' of the brothers' rivalry.

Mr Miliband said: 'The truth is I did not think I would be in this position.But I am now, I'm excited, I am engaged. Of course I am sad to go, but I am excited by the challenge ahead.'

He added: 'These things, you can never erase them from memory or history.

'But Ed and I are brothers for life. That is something that you value and that you nurture whatever the difficulty of the circumstances.'

Asked if his relationship with Ed was 'healing', Mr Miliband replied: 'Of course.'

Comparing the brothers to Wimbledon tennis finalists Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, he continued: 'The important thing though is that you've got to never lead your life by looking in the rear view mirror.

'You can't afford to end up eating yourself up with that kind of struggle.

'You've got to try and say, there are the Murrays of this world who win and there are the Djokovics who come second. You've got to be gracious when you don't win.'

Mr Miliband also rejected the idea that Britain was entering a period where the only governments would be coalitions.

'I think the conventional assumption that we are bound to get a coalition is wrong,' he said.

'In the end the British people will take a view and I think that is a great prize for Labour. The danger is that could be a great prize for the Tories as well.

'Remember, the polls are meaningless at this stage because they start with the question: 'How would you vote if there was an election tomorrow?'

'There isn't an election tomorrow. People will come to a judgement about the future of the country in two years' time, and I would say it is all to play for, it is open.

'I don't think anyone on either side should be banking on the fact that it is bound to be a coalition.

'I don't see it that way.'
