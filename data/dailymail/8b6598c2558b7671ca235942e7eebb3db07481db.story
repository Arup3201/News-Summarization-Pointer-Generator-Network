Days after the UK finally withdrew its troops from one conflict zone, it is preparing to send servicemen back to another.

The last British soldiers pulled out of Afghanistan a fortnight ago but officers are set to head to Iraq in order to help prevent yet more territory falling into the hands of Islamic State terrorists.

British training teams will be sent to the semi-autonomous Kurdish zone of Iraq to help US forces reclaim territory in the north and west of the country that fell to Islamic State earlier in the year.

The dramatic move will be the first British mission to Iraq since it pulled all its forces out of the country in 2011 – eight years after the mission that vanquished Saddam Hussein.

‘If Iraq fails or the government becomes sectarian then that is a massive problem’, a Whitehall spokesman told The Times.

‘If we are serious then we have got to stop [it] failing. If we can stabilise Iraq then we have got a hard shoulder to start putting the squeeze back on Syria. If we lose Iraq then we are doomed.’

Large swathes of Iraq are already controlled by Islamic State extremists and the US-led mission is to help the new prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, stabilise his country.

The US has already agreed to send about 500 soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division to Iraq and elsewhere in the region, with the aim of retraining the Iraqi army, which crumbled when attacked by IS in the summer.

Britain has so far only sanctioned a two-week training course on heavy machineguns in Arbil, involving 12 soldiers from 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment. 

The British Government pledged in August that it would not send ‘boots on the ground’ to deal with the Iraq crisis, but deployed 150 special forces troops after Prime Minister David Cameron warned that the situation may require ‘military action to go after the terrorists’.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the mission had escalated beyond a humanitarian one and could last for months, and said that the Islamist fanatics of IS had to be stopped before they became strong enough to launch attacks on British soil.

General John Allen, President Obama’s special envoy for the anti-Isis coalition, indicated in London last month that he was hopeful Britain would participate in the US training programme for the Iraq forces.
