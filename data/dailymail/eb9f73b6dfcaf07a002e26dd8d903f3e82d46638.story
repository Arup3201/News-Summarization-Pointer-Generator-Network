As a baby, doctors believed Calvin was just hours from death. But he is now preparing for his third birthday

The parents of a little boy who doctors believed was just hours from death are preparing for his third birthday.

Emma Wilkinson, 32, and Gary Marshall, 42, were told their son Calvin was unlikely to survive emergency heart and stomach operations in the weeks after he was born.

The little boy was born with a heart condition which was picked up at Miss Wilkinson's 20 week scan.

It means the chambers in his heart were reversed, leaving two big holes - a condition termed 'transposition of the great vessels'.

The heart problem was found to be an isolated defect probably caused by a random mutation, and could be fixed immediately after delivery with major heart surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Having been separated from her son 
after the birth at University College London Hospital on August 11th 
2011, Miss Wilkinson rushed over to the children's hospital in time to 
see Calvin - named after the boy in Bill 
Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes comic strips - being prepared for theatre.

She said: 'He was in the middle of a huge system of different machines.

Tubes
 were coming in and out everywhere. But apart from the fact his hands 
and feet were a little blue, he looked completely normal.'

The heart surgery was a success but celebrations were cut short when Calvin stayed unconscious for two days.

His repaired heart was beating too fast, leading to problems with the blood supply to his stomach.

Ten
 days after the surgery Calvin finally opened his eyes. But later that 
day his bowel ruptured, immediately requiring a round of life-saving 
surgery.

Miss Wilkinson said: 'That's when the surgeon told us to expect the worst. 'We were devastated.'

'I
 watched him, hooked up to all the machines, and reflected on the fact 
that he had been through so much in his few days with us.

'We didn't want to be anywhere else other than with Calvin, but at the same time we couldn't face being in intensive care any longer. 

'We just wanted him to get better.'

But then, despite the odds, Calvin grew stronger.

Miss Wilkinson said: 'We were approaching the doors to the ward when a nurse ran towards us and excitedly said she had some wonderful news. Calvin had turned a corner.'

As the year drew to a close, Calvin contracted a nervous infection requiring a three-week stay in hospital over Christmas and he now has a shunt fitted to drain excess fluid from his brain.

But by January 2012, doctors were confident that Calvin was finally out of the danger zone.

Miss Wilkinson said: 'We're never going to be able to be relax fully.

'We need to stay vigilant for infections and we stay in close contact with the specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

'Calvin will see speech and occupational therapists, but everyone's really happy with him and he's reaching all the right developmental milestones.

Three years on, and Calvin has reached all the right developmental milestones, and is looking forward to his third birthday

'He's very cheeky and happy all the time. He loves giving out kisses and cuddles. He's very gentle with other children.

'He's also quite stubborn - he knows what he wants and he's determined to get it. It's a characteristic which must have helped while he was fighting.

'Sometimes I think back to those moments when we didn't think Calvin would survive, and think how lucky we are. Things could have been completely different.

'I really think of him as a miracle. But his survival was all down to him. He's got a strong fighting spirit.'
