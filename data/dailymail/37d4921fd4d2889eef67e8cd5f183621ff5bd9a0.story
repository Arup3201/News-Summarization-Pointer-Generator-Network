Steven Gerrard's retirement from international football will leave a huge hole in England’s midfield. I don’t see any midfielder currently in or around the squad who can replicate what he does and deliver the range of passing he has from deep positions.

Roy Hodgson must have been bitterly disappointed that he couldn’t persuade him to stay on for another two years. Undoubtedly his decision to quit the international game will benefit Liverpool enormously and damage England’s hopes, especially as they play their toughest opponents in Euro 2016 qualifying, Switzerland, a week tomorrow.

With Frank Lampard retiring, too, and the manager having to cope with injuries, there is an obvious lack of experience in the midfield. But now the captain has gone, it will be up to the new guard to assume the mantle. We do not have a player who can sit deep as Steven has done latterly in his career and deliver those 40- or 50-yard passes.

Farewell: Steven Gerrard retired from international duty after England's dismal World Cup in Brazil

Game over: England's draw with Costa Rica at the World Cup proved to the Gerrard's final cap

Michael Carrick might come closest with the way he can slide balls in, but he’s injured, so the task is likely to fall to Jordan Henderson, Gerrard’s team-mate at Liverpool. I’m hoping that in the friendly against Norway on Wednesday we see him step up to international level. Perhaps he might even blossom now he will be the main man and Gerrard has gone, as the manager will have to hang his hat on him.

Though Henderson has thrived in the past 18 months at club level, taking leaps and bounds forward in his form, we have yet to see that in an England shirt. He does have the ability in his locker. Look at the pass he played to help set up Raheem Sterling’s goal in the opening game of the season. He can deliver those exquisite balls, but he has to do so more consistently. With England, he tends to regress to a more stilted game where he goes short, square and back. This is a challenge for him to seize the opportunity and to dominate.

Time to step up: Jordan Henderson (centre) could take advantage of Gerrard's retirement

But the player I think Hodgson will be most positive about is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. He has that flexibility as a midfielder in that he can play wide and in the middle and as such has a few strings to his bow. He still plays a little bit off the cuff, which is a good thing, as he gives you that injection of pace and creativity wherever he plays. Before the World Cup and his unfortunate injury, he looked like he was playing himself into the team.

But he can add real quality to England’s midfield: look at the lovely little clipped ball he played in for Olivier Giroud at Everton. It’s Oxlade-Chamberlain’s early-season form that has impressed me the most. He has come back from his injury and picked up the reins from where he left off in those pre-World Cup friendlies. He might end up in central midfield permanently, as Arsene Wenger likes him in that role, and I think he will be there for these England matches, with Henderson sitting and possibly his Arsenal team-mate Jack Wilshere alongside him. Wilshere could play in the role that Ross Barkley would have filled in an attacking midfield before injury ruled him out.

There are huge gaps in the England midfield but that means huge opportunities as well. It’s up to Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere to seize them.

Can we now get even more out of Rooney?

Wayne Rooney is the new England captain and he was the obvious choice, but I’m hoping that we will now see an even better player in the England shirt.

It’s not that Rooney doesn’t play well for England; he does. Even at the World Cup, when he came in for some criticism after the Italy game, you could see that he was doing his job and performing at a higher level than most players could reach.

But you feel there is still more to come from Rooney with England, even at the age of 28. Sometimes giving a player that responsibility, and the reassurance that he is your top man, can allow him to thrive.

Alan Shearer was my captain with England and he relished the idea of being our leader. He would have always given 100 per cent whatever, but maybe it just lifted his game a little. That’s what I’m now hoping to see from Rooney.

Leading by example: Wayne Rooney was named England captain by Roy Hodgson last week

Why Sturridge will have to do Mario's running

It seems the whole football world will be waiting to see which Mario Balotelli turns up when Tottenham take on Liverpool. He is a one-off and he does unusual things — on and off the pitch.

At his best he has the ability to run off the back of defenders, to score goals, to hold the ball up and to win headers if you get crosses in.

But it totally depends on his mood. On another day he won’t run in behind people, he can’t hold the ball up and he doesn’t go for headers. His best games are nine out of 10 marks performances, but his worst are four out of 10. To be a quality player he needs to make sure that his worst performances are sevens. As I wrote last week, if Brendan Rodgers can coax that out of him, he will have an absolute bargain.

Raring to go: Mario Balotelli (centre) could prove to be an astute signing for Liverpool after costing £16million

All change: Daniel Sturridge (left) will have to play the Luis Suarez role after the arrival of Balotelli

Your worry would be the number of times he has had to be substituted early in games because he wasn’t delivering. It happened again at the World Cup when Italy coach Cesare Prandelli had to take him off at half-time in their match against Uruguay because his performance was so erratic.

His relationship with Daniel Sturridge will be one to watch. Sturridge likes to be the main man up top of the attack and Luis Suarez used to do a lot of the work in behind him, chasing down the ball and dropping in. There’s no way Balotelli will be doing that, so I would imagine Sturridge will now be asked to carry out the Suarez role, when I’m pretty sure he would rather play as the furthest-forward striker.

But if you’re going to play two up front — and you would want both of those players on the pitch — then someone will have to sacrifice himself a little and it definitely will not be Balotelli. However it turns out, we won’t be able to take our eyes away as the story unfolds..

Manchester City again have the chance to prove themselves against the best in the Champions League with Bayern Munich in their group. I know they beat Bayern away last year, but that was after the Germans had qualified. A better guide would be the 3-1 lesson Bayern gave City at the Etihad. 

I can’t believe Manuel Pellegrini will have two up front again. In the Champions League you have to adjust your tactics. Sir Alex Ferguson did so. City have the depth, the experience and the quality to do better again this year — but I still suspect they’ll be second to Bayern in their group.
