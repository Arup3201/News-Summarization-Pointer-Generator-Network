Four Jaguar car adverts have been banned for glorifying high speeds and ‘encouraging dangerous driving’.

Advertising watchdogs were unhappy that Jaguar’s ‘irresponsible’ focus on the speed and acceleration of their cars was emphasised by the sound of engines being revved and high tempo music.

But the rap could prove a blessing in disguise for the British sports and luxury car firm whose latest slogan is: ‘It’s good to be bad.’

'Encouraging dangerous driving': Four Jaguar car adverts have been banned for glorifying high speeds

Ruling: Advertising watchdogs were unhappy that Jaguar's 'irresponsible' focus on the speed and acceleration of their cars was emphasised by the sound of engines being revved and high tempo music

The four banned video adverts on Jaguar's website showed a car driving at speed through a tunnel in Switzerland and crossing over the single white lines in the middle of a road, before driving across a mountain road at night.

Another scene showed a car driving on open land at high speed, while voice-overs said: ‘The adaptive dynamics technology reacts 20 times faster than the human eye.

‘It delivers a smooth drive by continuously analysing speed, steering and body movement of the car 500 times a second, giving every journey an instinctive, stable and agile ride.’

The adverts ended with the Jaguar logo alongside text reading: ‘Jaguar. How alive are you?’ to the sound of an engine revving.

One viewer complained that the ads were irresponsible because they ‘glorified speed and encouraged dangerous driving’. Advertising watchdogs agreed and ordered the videos be withdrawn.

But the ban could ironically be a boost to the car firm which  has built a whole campaign around the strapline ‘It’s good to be bad’ and hired  big-screen A-listers Sir Ben Kingsley, Mark Strong and Tom Hiddlestone to act as its ‘villainous’ ambassadors.

In one Bond-like movie advert for the Jaguar F-Type - which has not been banned - Sir Ben intones: ’Have you ever  wondered why in movies, all the villains are played by  Brits?’

Jaguar also has David Beckham as its brand ambassador in China.

'Because we considered that speed was the main message of the ads and the ads portrayed the cars being driven in a dangerous manner, we concluded the ads were irresponsible and condoned dangerous driving'

Advertising Standards Authority

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the overall impression of the four banned adverts  was a focus on the speed and acceleration of the cars, emphasised by the sound of engines being revved, high tempo music and the use of blurred lines.

It noted that the cars were driving on what appeared to be public roads and in a manner that would be ‘irresponsible and illegal’ on a public road in the UK.

The ASA said: ‘We considered that the cars were being handled in a dangerous manner that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly.

‘The ASA acknowledged that Jaguar had amended the ads to include an on-screen caption, which stated that the ads were filmed on closed roads with a professional driver and advising that viewers always obeyed local speed limits.

‘However, we did not consider that this amendment went far enough to resolve the points of complaint.

‘Because we considered that speed was the main message of the ads and the ads portrayed the cars being driven in a dangerous manner, we concluded the ads were irresponsible and condoned dangerous driving.’

It ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form and told Jaguar ‘not to portray speed as the focus of an ad in future... and not to portray driving behaviour that might encourage motorists to drive irresponsibly in future’.

Jaguar said the footage of the cars on the open highway was filmed in Switzerland on closed sections of road on the Susten Pass and the Grimsel Pass, but a caption making this clear was mistakenly omitted.

The company said the ads' emphasis was the technical features and abilities of the cars, and the shots of the cars crossing lanes on the closed road were specifically to highlight the lightweight construction for cornering stability and safety.

It said the ads ‘at no time demonstrated any dangerous driving’ and there was no indication that speed limits were broken.

Jaguar has unleashed its fastest and most powerful road-legal production car ever with a top speed of 186mph and a £140,000 price-tag to match.

The exclusive super-fast two-seater F-Type ‘Project 7’ will accelerate from rest to 60mph in just 3.8 seconds and is to make its fitting public debut at the opening of the four-day Goodwood Festival of Speed in Sussex tomorrow.

However, perhaps in keeping with Jaguar’s ‘bad boy’ marketing strategy, its launch also coincides with the stern rap from advertising watchdogs who criticised the manufacturer for glorifying speed.

Jaguar says its new luxury sports car is a ‘fully road-legal’ two-seater open-topped roadster with  race-inspired bucket seats, a specially designed stowable roof and 196-litres of luggage space.

It is the first to be built by Jaguar Land Rover’s recently-founded ‘Special Vehicle Operations’ division with production limited to an exclusive limited-edition run of 250 cars globally.

First deliveries are to begin in the middle of next year for those who can afford the sticker price of up to £140,000.

The name ‘Project 7’ acknowledges Jaguar’s seven historic Le Mans race wins overall.

The design has been inspired by the Jaguar D-Type racing car launched exactly 60 years ago which in the 1950s clocked up three wins in the Le Mans 24 hour endurance race and which was itself the inspiration for the legendary E-Type sports car that epitomised the Swinging Sixties.

A Jaguar spokesman said: ‘It is the fastest and most powerful production Jaguar ever built. We will produce it in an exclusive run of up to 250 units, hand-built by Jaguar Land Rover’s Special Operations team.’

Powered by a 5.0-litre supercharged V8 engine developing 575 horsepower - as much as nearly six Ford Fiestas -  it accelerates from rest to  60mph in just 3.8 seconds and has a top speed electronically limited to 186mph.

It features super-lightweight and  aerodynamically sculptured carbon-fibre bodywork designed to cut down weight and help it cut through the air with less resistance. 

Aerodynamic side skirts, rear diffuser and an adjustable rear spoiler are all made of carbon-fibre to generate 177 per cent more ‘downforce’ to keep it firmly on the road, rather than taking off like an aircraft.

John Edwards, managing director of Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations said: ‘It's the most powerful production Jaguar ever built, and pays homage to Jaguar's seven outright Le Mans victories with distinctive design cues inspired by the Jaguar D-type which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year.’

Power is sent to the rear wheels through Jaguar’s eight-speed Quickshift automatic gearbox with manual override. 

And it has equally powerful carbon ceramic brakes to keep it rooted to the road – even on tight bends - and bring it to a safe stop.

Even the exhaust pipe system can be tweaked to increase or decrease the roar from this latest leaping cat car which rides on specially made 20in gloss black alloy wheels.

Jaguar’s chief engineer for vehicle dynamics Mike Cross said: ‘The result is a driving experience that’s pure and involving in every sense.’

Each car will sport a specially numbered plaque located between the two seats and signed by Jaguar design director Ian Callum.

New release: The interior features carbon-fibre veneer inserts on the console, an Alcantara steering wheel with a leather option and machined aluminium gearshift paddles

He said: ‘F-Type Project 7 is the perfect example of how, as a design team, we can move quickly with our engineering colleagues. We’ve pushed the boundaries of what’s possible. It is the perfect contemporary embodiment of the D-type that inspired it.’

The driver and passenger sit in lightweight race-inspired bucket seats finished in a quilted racing-style diamond pattern. Four-point racing harnesses are available as an accessory.

The interior features carbon-fibre veneer inserts on the console, an Alcantara steering wheel with a leather option, machined aluminium gearshift paddles and bespoke tread-plates with the ‘Project 7’ logo.

The car will be offered in five metallic colours: Ultra Blue, Italian Racing Red, British Racing Green (all with white racing decal options), Ultimate Black and a new colour, Glacier White (both with grey decal options).
