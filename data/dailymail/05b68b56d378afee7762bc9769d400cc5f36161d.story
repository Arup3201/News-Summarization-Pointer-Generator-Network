A 21-year-old woman is believed to be one of the youngest ever to be arrested on suspicion of assisting a suicide after the discovery of another young woman's body.

Police were called to a house in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, on Wednesday after the body of Emma Crossman, also 21, was found.

Officers and paramedics rushed to the house, and a short while later the other woman - believed to be a friend of Miss Crossman - was arrested on suspicion of assisting suicide.

Death: Police were called to a house in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, on Wednesday after the body of Emma Crossman (pictured), 21, was found

She was later released on bail, 
pending further police inquiries. Curtains at the terraced house 
remained closed yesterday and a Police Community Support Officer car was 
parked outside.

Although a 
post mortem examination has been carried out on Miss Crossman, police have not revealed details of how she 
died.

A spokesman for Care 
Not Killing said: 'In terms of somebody being arrested for assisted 
suicide within the borders of the United Kingdom this is the youngest 
we've heard of.'

Sue Price, 
33, who lived on the same street, described Miss Crossman as a 'happy and bubbly' 
girl who didn't have any obvious health issues.

She
 said: 'She didn't seem to be depressed or poorly - to hear there's 
suicide involved just baffles me as she just seemed so lovely, happy and
 bubbly all the time.

'It's an absolute tragedy, she was so young'

Sue Price, neighbour

'She lived there with her boyfriend I believe and we used to see her going out with her dad.

'We noticed there were two ambulances outside the house on Wednesday morning but thought it was just something minor.  

â€˜We never expected anything like this - it's an absolute tragedy, she was so young.'

Investigation: Although a post mortem examination has been carried out on Miss Crossman (pictured with an unknown male), police have not revealed details of how she died

Adam Deakins, 22, who lived opposite the dead woman said: 'I knew her to say hello to in the street, It is a real shock.

'I saw all the police cars and a vehicle with blacked out windows arrive on Wednesday morning and I wondered what had happened.

'One of my friends had told me later that she had died and that one of her friends had been arrested. I couldn't believe it.'
