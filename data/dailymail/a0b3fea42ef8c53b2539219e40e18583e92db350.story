For most dogs, a trip to the vet is a rare outing reserved for rescuing swallowed socks and trapped paws.

But one animal has grown more than accustomed to the inside of a waiting room, after seeking medical treatment 100 times in just three years. 

Alancier the Newfoundland has spent an astonishing 210 hours in the care of vets in Bodmin, Cornwall. 

Alancier the Newfoundland has spent more than 200 hours in vets' care. The dog suffers a range of health problems including urinary infections, skin allergies and has a leg deformity

While owner Pam Withe thought the dog was clumsy as a puppy, she has spent hundreds of hours and thousands of pounds ensuring her health over three years

From elbow infections and leg deformities to allergies to medicine, the animal has wracked up almost £15,000 in treatment bills with her range of ailments. 

'Alancier is so used to being in medical care that when the vet calls her name at reception, she immediately rushes over and knows it's her turn,' said owner Pam Withe. 

'If we weren't insured we couldn't afford to keep her with all the vet bills,' the 60-year-old added. 

When first brought home, Mrs Withe and her husband, David, put her injuries down to being accident prone. 

Among Alancier's health problems is a skin allergy which causes blisters on her paws (bandaged, above)

The animal was born with elbow dysplasia, giving her an 'odd' walk and causing her to have bone-shortening surgery as a pupypy

Five-stone Alancier has spent so much time visiting vets she now runs to be seen when her name is called

Among her health problems is a skin allergy which causes the dog to break out in blisters occasionally

Feeling better: Alancier with other pets in Mrs Withe's home. Minstrel, a spaniel, (centre) is in good health while Learbhead, also a Newfoundland, died recently of natural causes

Soon her health problems began to stack up, with the dog almost unable to walk because of a joint problem. 

'When Alancier was a pup we thought she was just adorably clumsy. She had a pronounced odd walk with her front legs but she actually had a displaced elbow. 

Health problems

Elbow dysplasia 

Rheumatism in front legs  

Leg deformity (result of bone shortening operation to correct elbow displasia) 

Skin allergy which causes blister rash 

Drooping jaws as a result of allergy tablets

Recurring urinary infection  

Treatments

Bone-shortening operation to correct elbow dysplasia

Anti-inflammatory tablets to control Rheumatism 

Glucose tablets to reduce pain in legs

Anti-allergy injections 

Special diet to offset urinary infection

Tablets for when infection is most severe 

'Within six months, we were taking her to the vets for an operation on her front legs to shorten the bone.'

As a result of her displaced elbow, Alancier was left with a severe deformity which vets have tried to correct with surgery and hours of hydrotherapy. 

New problems arose in the form of infections and rashes, with a skin allergy causing the dog to often break out in blisters.   

'As Alancier got older, her medical history subsequently developed from bruises and bumps to more unfortunate ailments, including rashes and ripping her claw twice. Now she’s had to have a claw removed.

'She has an ongoing skin allergy caused by a house dust mite, which bring out blisters on her skin. She was initially given tablets but she had an allergy to that so now she gets injections

'Alancier’s urine doesn’t process properly and she’s on a special diet for life to treat that. 

'You have to keep a careful eye on Alancier to make sure she hasn’t got any other ailments.'

'Alancier might be Britain’s unluckiest dog because of the long list of illnesses she’s had.

'But at the same time, she’s the world’s luckiest dog because at least, she’s got us to look after her!' 

Staff at Nute Veterinary Surgery are among those who care for Alancier. The surgery was recognised by Petplan last year, a pet insurance company. 

'Vet Nicky Hallows and her team at Nute Veterinary Surgery take care of Alancier. Nute Veterinary Surgery were recognised for their hard work and continued care of pets like Alancier and received an accolade at the 2014 Petplan Veterinary Awards.'
