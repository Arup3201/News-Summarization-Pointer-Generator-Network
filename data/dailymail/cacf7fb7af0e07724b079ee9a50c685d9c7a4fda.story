The Miami farmhand who brutally raped, murdered and dismembered nine-year-old Jimmy Ryce in 1995 will be executed next month, Florida Governor Rick Scott announced yesterday.

Juan Carlos Chavez, 46, will be killed by injection on February 12 over the murder which shocked America and led to new laws allowing the state to indefinitely detain sexual predators.

After nearly 20 years of anguish and uncertainty, Jimmy's family say Chavez's execution is the justice they have been waiting for.

'I just received the news that justice 
will finally be done in the murder of my son, Jimmy, on September 11, 
1995,' father Don Ryce said in a statement, according to The Miami Herald.

'I feel
 a combination of sadness and relief. I hope this sends a message to 
predators that this behavior will not go unpunished.'

Don Ryce is expected to address the media today.

Jimmy disappeared on September 11, 1995, near his school-bus stop.

In December, the young boy's book bag was found in the trailer where Chavez was 
living. His dismembered remains were found sealed in cement-filled pots behind Chavez's home.

Following 50 hours of police questioning, Chavez confessed to kidnapping Jimmy at gunpoint, driving him to the remote trailer on a horse farm, raping him, then shooting him when he tried to run away.

Chavez said Jimmy asked him at least twice if he was going to be killed, a question Chavez refused to answer.

Chavez was sentenced to death in Orange County on November 23, 1998.

At the sentencing, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Marc Schumacher highlighted the savagery with which Jimmy was treated.

'The defendant, Juan Carlos Chavez, by his actions has forfeited his right to live among us,' Schumacher said. 'There can be no doubt that Samuel James Ryce lived every minute of the last few hours of his life with the fear of death.'

However, Chavez delayed his inevitable execution by nearly 20 years by appealing the decision.

The Miami Herald reported the Florida Supreme Court twice considered and rejected his appeals.

Chavez's lawyers raised an array of appeal issues, including his original defense lawyer testifying in 2007 that he failed to properly defend Chavez because he was on medication for vertigo and a hearing disorder.

Jimmy's horrific murder sent shock waves around Florida, with the little boy's parents becoming crusaders 
for child victims.

Don and Claudine Ryce created a foundation in their son’s name, helping schools develop 'stranger-danger' programs, donating tracking bloodhounds to police 
departments, supporting the parents of abducted children and pushing 
for anti-predator legislation.

In 1996, they met with then-President Bill Clinton as he signed
 an order allowing the posting of missing children’s photos in federal 
buildings.

They also pushed for the 1998 Jimmy Ryce Act which allows the state to indefinitely detain violent sexual predators who have completed their sentences.

Claudine Ryce died of a heart attack in 2009. Martha Ryce, Jimmy’s sister, committed suicide at age 35 in December 2012. Jimmy's killer had outlived them both.

Chavez will be executed at the Florida State Prison in Starke.
