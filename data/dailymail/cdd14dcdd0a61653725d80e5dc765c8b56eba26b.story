It has been nearly three hundred years since French King Louis XIV died in his beloved Palace of Versailles.

But the job of hunting the underground rodents that irritated the monarch as they destroyed his luxurious palace gardens still exists today.

Jerome Dormion is the latest in a long line of molecatchers employed to keep the royal palace and gardens rodent-free.

The 36-year-old uses archaic metal traps that kill moles when their two prongs contract and snap the animals' necks.

But while the role might sound like something of a gimmick, Mr Dormion insists that his position is 'serious work'.

The enthusiast signs his text messages off with the line 'Molecatcher to the King' and says his job is to ensure 'molehills don't deface Europe's finest gardens'.

The former gardener added: 'We still have visiting dignitaries too. Imagine if they were to see them.'

Mr Dormion is responsible for keeping the around 800 hectares (2,000 acres) of magnificent horticulture mole-free on the grounds, which include Marie Antoinette's cherished farm and famed gardener Andre Le Notre's Royal Path and Grand Canal.

While
Dormion approaches his constant hunt for the burrowing rodents with 
vigour, he also adds a touch of humour when talking about his role.

Archaic: Dormion uses an age-old technique to catch the moles - a metal trap that smashes together when the mole passes, trapping the animal

He said: 'I'm known as the king's molecatcher 
because Versailles is still the palace. The king might be 
gone, but the palace still has moles, loads of them. Which 
is good, as it keeps me in work.'

Dormion recalls one of his proudest moments as the capture of a ole he had been chasing for months.

He said: 'Moles are exceptionally clever. 
That's why the majority of gardeners can't catch them. One of the 
wiliest I have ever encountered outsmarted my traps for three months... Eventually, it got lazy and I got it.'

Dormion also highlights how versatile 
the mole is. On a scorching summer day, he once stood aghast at a 
strange sight in one of the royal fountains: a mole swimming around the 
basin.

'In my job,' says Dormion, 'I never fail to be surprised.'

Molecatcher to the king: Dormion is the latest in a 330-year line of molecatchers employed on the palace grounds

The royal molecatcher was first hired by 
Louis XIV, the Bourbon king who moved the court to Versailles, in the 
late 1600s. Historians say that the monarch lavished so much
money on the upkeep of his beloved residence that it plunged the entire
country into debt.

Large mounds of earth mark out the routes travelled by the moles - solitary underground rodents with giant paws for digging.

As the palace lies around 7.5 miles 
outside Paris' city walls in the countryside, moles have long been able 
to burrow through the gardens, much to many groundskeepers' annoyance.

Dormion describes his trapping technique as resembling a guillotine and says that he first tried poison but decided the 
trap, invented in the 1600s, was the best technique and most 
faithful to the historic role.

Zoologists say that a decline in natural predators like wild cats and weasels has resulted in a boom in mole populations.

One
single mole can make 30 molehills a day, which could see the entire 
gardens pockmarked within weeks if a large number of the rodents are 
burrowing within its walls.

Speaking about King Louis XIV's insistence on ridding the grounds of moles, head gardener Alan Baraton said: 'Versailles was the greatest symbol of France. After everything (Louis) spent on the gardens, imagine if the moles had been allowed to run riot? All this money would have been squandered, wasted.'

The molecatcher was rewarded with their own residence at Versailles. From the 1600s, the molecatchers all came from the same family - the Liards - until in 1812 Napoleon Bonaparte put a stop to the succession.

'The last Liard molecatcher was a bit of a party animal, and turned the residence into a cabaret and a brothel,' said Baraton.

'One day Napoleon was strolling in the gardens, and a prostitute came out and propositioned him. The molecatcher was immediately thrown out and that was the end of the residence.'

The gardener also cheekily suggests that good mole-catching can save lives.

In 1702, William III of England died from injuries he sustained after his horse tripped on a molehill.

'If the king had been more careful about the upkeep of his grass, he would not have been dead at 52 years old,' says Baraton.
