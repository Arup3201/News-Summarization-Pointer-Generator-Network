Arsenal and Tottenham are fighting for the loan signing of Shakhtar Donetsk’s Brazilian forward Douglas Costa, with Roma and AC Milan also keen.

Costa is one of six Shakhtar players refusing to return to Ukraine as conflict rages around the club’s home city – and the two North London rivals are offering an exit route.

But the 23-year-old’s current club are reluctant to sanction a move for one of their top stars, with owner Rinat Akhmetov already stating that: ‘There won’t be a clearance sale.’

And Costa does not want to try to force a move as he does not want to look like a mercenary.

The Shakhtar players 'all run a deadly risk if we are in the region,' Costa said on his Instagram page.

He claimed he
 and the other five absent players wanted to train in Switzerland during
 the conflict and were not seeking a transfer.

'I like 
the club, the people, the city, but I'm afraid,' he said in comments 
posted alongside a picture of the Shakhtar badge. 'We want to stay at 
the club, but we must have risk-free working conditions.'

Costa is a former Manchester United target, and a move to Arsenal or Spurs would see either side gain a player with Champions League experience from his time in Donetsk.
