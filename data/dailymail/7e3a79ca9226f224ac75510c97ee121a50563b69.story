In court: Royal Barnes, from Hackney, is accused of creating clips 'glorifying' the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby

A 22-year-old salesman has
 been charged with terror offences after allegedly making a series of 
videos 'glorifying' the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

Royal
 Barnes, from Hackney, east London, is accused of creating clips celebrating the 
father-of-one's execution in Woolwich, including one called 'Muslim laughs at
 British Soldier killing'.

He is also accused of inciting terrorism overseas and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court after being arrested
 on Friday along with a 21-year-old woman, who is due to answer bail tomorrow.

Lee Rigby, 25, a father-of-one from the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was run down by a car and then hacked to death as he returned to his barracks in south-east London.

A Scotland 
Yard spokesman said today Barnes is charged with dissemination of terrorist 
publications for allegedly making a series of recordings about Drummer 
Rigby's death on May 22, and circulating them 'with the intention, 
either directly or indirectly of encouraging others into the commission,
 preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism'.

He
 is also charged with encouraging an act of terrorism by publishing a 
statement that glorified the killing, and inciting terrorism overseas.

It
 is claimed that on June 12 he 'incited another to commit an act of 
terrorism, wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom, and that act, 
would if committed in England and Wales constitute an offence'.

Barnes, who insisted on standing 
throughout the court hearing, was refused bail and remanded in custody 
until a hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday, August 16.

Tributes: Flowers at the spot in Woolwich where the soldier died, which allegedly led to the video 'Muslim laughs at British Soldier killing' being posted online

The
 consumer relations worker, who wore a blue and white striped t-shirt to
 court, was flanked by two guards in the dock, speaking only to confirm 
his name and address at the start of proceedings.

He was supported in the public gallery by his wife of nine-months and another man.

Barnes has not entered pleas to charges 
of Dissemination of terrorist publications, encouraging terrorism, and 
inciting terrorism overseas.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are charged with Lee Rigby's murder on May 22.
