Weddings are an occasion to share among friends and family, but four siblings just took the concept to a new level.

Four of Kevin and Marie Fortney’s six children tied the knot to their significant others in tandem in St George, Utah, on Saturday.

The group was comprised of three sisters and a brother whose ages are unknown.

All in the family: Four of the Fortney siblings from St George, Utah were married in a communal ceremony on Saturday

Party on: The group celebrated their nuptials with a big reception on Saturday night

One of the siblings, a brunette named Grace, told KSL.com of the wedding’s concept: ‘With most families this definitely would not work, but thankfully I have wonderful wonderful sisters and a wonderful brother.’

While planning the wedding the siblings let each other pick what really mattered to them in order to make the event a meaningful one.

‘I couldn’t be happier with every one one of our new children,’ Mrs Fortney said of her children’s new spouses.

Stylistic approaches: While the siblings opted for a group ceremony, their individual wedding photos show off their unique tastes

Pure joy: The siblings' mother Marie said of the wedding: 'I couldn't be happier with every one one of our new children'

Only a portion: While three of the Fortney daughters and one son were married, the brood still has two other siblings that did not participate in the ceremony

Her husband felt similarly. ‘There are few things that can compare to the fullness of joy that you feel when your children are happy,’ Mr Fortney added.

The entire brood celebrated their nuptials with a giant, communal reception on Saturday evening.
