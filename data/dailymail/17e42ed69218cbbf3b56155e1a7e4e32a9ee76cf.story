British make-up artist and former model Jemma Kidd has offered a glimpse inside her stunning English country house.

The 39-year-old - who became a countess after marrying Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, in 2005 - moved from London to the Hampshire estate with her husband four years ago, shortly after their twins, Darcy and Mae, were born.

In images from the new issue of Elle Decor, the 18th century home, which she calls an 'oasis,' boasts a huge garden, lavish rooms and heirlooms from the first Duke of Wellington's personal collection - as well as their own modern, personal touches.

Spacious: The house is located on the Stratfield Saye estate, which has belonged to the Earl of Mornington's family for two centuries. They keep seven horses on the property

The house is named the Old Rectory and is located on the Stratfield Saye estate, which has belonged to the Earl of Mornington's family for two centuries.

Due to its rich history, the couple had to make some necessary changes when they moved in. 'Like in most English country houses, it took three hours to fill a bath,' explains Ms Kidd.

What's more, the rooms were lined with antique paper and featured hand basins, and the heating was virtually nonexistent.

To modernize it, they added 40 radiators as well as heating under the floors and state-of-the art boilers.

Design: The Morningtons chose South African-born decorator Penny Morrison to do the interiors. 'Things should be more eclectic, as if you've collected them over the years,' Ms Morrison says

Mixed genres: In the kitchen, an antique French bench sits by the doors to the garden, and steel bar stools sit at the marble countertop

Warm: Red floral designs decorate the guest room, which features prints of English scenery, a wedding gift, on the walls

It's the mixture of old and new that make the home so charming. 'Everything is calm, happier, and less stressed,' she says of their country abode in comparison to living in London.

'As soon as you drive into the park, it's like you've entered an oasis.'

One of the unique features is a collection of busts of the first Duke of Wellington, as well as antique trunks that carried his clothes.

The latter have been stacked on top of one another in Wellesley's study to be used as tables.

In one of the two libraries, large world maps hang on the walls and custom-made bookshelves house an assortment of colorful volumes.

The cushions and ottoman are sewn in a 
Moroccan pattern, and a faded mirror above the mantle gives the room a 
rustic feel. In the drawing room, the fireplace is original to the 
house.

The Morningtons chose South African-born decorator Penny Morrison to do the interiors after seeing one of her projects in a magazine.

And they certainly see eye-to-eye when it comes to striking the right balance. 'Things should be more eclectic, as if you've collected them over the years,' Ms Morrison says.

And Ms Kidd remarks that the decorator can 'make rooms look chic, but also incredibly comfortable, inviting, and warm.'

In the kitchen, an antique French bench sits by the doors to the garden, and steel bar stools sit at the marble countertop.

Ms Kidd, whose younger sister Jodie was 
an international supermodel, told the magazine that she decided to 
abandon city life for the country because it's better for raising a 
family.

'[In London] There were gas fumes, rubbish on the pavement, and people everywhere,' she explains. 'I just said, "That's it, I'm not going to bring my kids up here."'

What's more, the property is spacious enough for her to pursue her passion - horse riding.

'In London there were gas fumes, 
rubbish on the pavement... I just 
said, "That's it, I'm not going to bring my kids up here"'

Indeed, in one if the images, the mother-of-two - who was a member of the national dressage team in her teens - sits happily atop Montana, one of the seven horses the family keep at the estate.

Arthur Wellesley is second in line to the title of Duke of Wellington, after his father Charles. Through his mother, Princess Antonia of Prussia, he is a descendent of Queen Victoria.

Ms Kidd led a successful career in modeling before becoming a make-up artist and launching her own cosmetics line in 2006.
