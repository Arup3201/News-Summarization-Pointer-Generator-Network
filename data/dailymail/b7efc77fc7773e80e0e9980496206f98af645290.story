The Emirati royal family now rule the waves after it was revealed they own the world's biggest mega-yacht, knocking Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's off the top spot.

The Chelsea owner's vessel Eclipse had been the world's biggest yacht for the past three years, but it has now been usurped by Azzam which is 54ft (16.5m) longer - the length of a football field penalty area.

The 590ft (180 metre) super-yacht is set to launch a new round of one-upmanship among the world's super-rich.

Battle: The Emirati royal family now rule the waves after it was revealed they own the world's biggest mega-yacht, knocking Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's off the top spot

Ownership of the £390million craft has 
been shrouded in secrecy, but Yachts France, which creates the annual 
mega yacht league table, revealed it belongs to Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed
 al-Nayan, President of the United Arab Emirates and Emir of Abu Dhabi.

Longer than 12 double-decker buses, 
not only is Azzam the biggest superyacht, it is also expected to be one 
of the fastest.

The 94,000 horsepower vessel could reach speeds of more 
than 30 knots, or 35mph.

Longer than some cruise ships: Azzam is described as the 'most complex and challenging yacht' ever built

The size of superyachts has grown as 
billionaires compete to own the largest and its builders boast that 
Azzam, which means dedication in Arabic, is the 'most complex and 
challenging yacht that has ever been built'.

It was designed by Nauta Yachts and constructed in Bremen by Lurssen - she was floated out in April.

The firm's Peter Lurssen said: 'She truly represents another milestone in yachting history.'

The yacht requires a staff of 50, and interior features include a 29ft salon and a stunning, open-plan interior.

Ownership of the £400million craft which is bigger than Roman Abramovich's superyacht has been shrouded in secrecy, but Yachts France, which creates the annual mega yacht league table, revealed it belongs to Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nayan, President of the United Arab Emirates and Emir of Abu Dhabi

French interior designer Christophe 
Leoni was briefed to produce a sophisticated and yet timeless interior 
with a turn-of-the-century, Empire style.

It is likely to match the luxury 
of Abraovich's Eclipse, which features an armour-plated master suite, 
two swimming pools, two helipads, a hall, a cinema, a mini-submarine and
 even its own missile defence system.

Abramovich has owned Eclipse, which is
 valued at £740million, since it was launched in 2010.

You wouldn't want to turn around in a hurry: Azzam is 54ft longer than Abramovich's yacht Eclipse

Abramovich's yacht Eclipse is smaller but boasts essentials such as two heliports,several jacuzzis and bulletproof glass

It took the title
 of world's biggest private yacht from the 454ft Rising Sun, owned by 
American businessman Larry Ellison, which in turn took over from the 
414ft Octopus, owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.

Azzam's design suggests it has been 
built for a buyer in the Middle East as it has about 50 suites but no 
large open spaces on deck, said TheYachtPhoto's Peter Seyfferth.

'I have never seen an Arab-owned yacht with big parties and girls round the pool like the Russians have,' he said.

'It is unlikely it will leave its dock very often. It is more of a question of prestige, to have the world's largest yacht.'

Of
 the top 100 yachts featured in the list, 31 were owned by people from 
the Middle East, 19 were Russian owned, and 17 belonged to Americans.

At 590.6ft long, Azzam is longer than 12 double-decker buses parked end-to-end.

At her widest point, known as the beam, Azzam measures 68.2ft, while her hull is 15.8ft deep.

She's heavier than Eclipse, too, with an estimated gross tonnage of 14,000GT - roughly equivalent to 1,750 adult African elephants.

Powered by two gas turbines and two diesel engines, she will boast an impressive 94,000 horsepower and a top speed in excess of 30 knots.

The world's largest super-yacht, Azzam, has been commissioned for a mystery owner and launched in Germany today

Azzam's fuel tank can hold one million litres and she will have a top speed of in excess of 30 knots.

It took the world's top engineers one 
year to design Azzam and three years to build her - but this is 
considered super-quick in ship-building terms.

Interior features will include a 29ft salon and a stunning, open-plan interior.

French interior designer Christophe 
Leoni was briefed to produce a sophisticated and yet timeless interior 
with a turn-of-the-century, Empire style.

Roman Abramovich's Eclipse is 533.1ft long and 72.2ft wide, and has an estimated gross tonnage of 13,500GT.

Eclipse, owned by Abramovich, has been revered by yachting enthusiasts for years on account of her size

She has four diesel engines and a 
maximum speed of 22 knots, which means Azzam will far outstrip her 
should the billionaire owners decide to have a race.

The yacht can accommodate 36 guests in
 comfort, and boasts a cinema, conference facilities, children's 
playroom, beauty salon, dance floor, swimming pool and sauna.

Built by Blohm +Voss Shipyards and 
designed inside and out by Terence Disdale, Eclipse was custom-made for 
the Chelsea oligarch in 2010.

Both ships are so huge, they would 
have trouble fitting into the majority of the world's marinas.  Only a 
handful, including Monaco and Antibes on the Riviera would be large 
enough to accommodate them.

However, despite Azzam eclipsing 
Eclipse today, neither of them comes close to the Titanic in terms of 
scale.  Built in 1912, the ill-fated Titanic was 882ft long and 92ft 
wide.
