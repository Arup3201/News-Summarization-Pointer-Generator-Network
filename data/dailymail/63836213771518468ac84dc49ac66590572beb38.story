She is preparing to celebrating her big 4-0 on Necker Island this Thursday but in true Mossy style, the supermodel has managed to squeeze in a high-end campaign before her landmark birthday.

The 39-year-old channels her inner rock chick as the star of Rimmel's latest beauty shoot to promote  ScandalEyes Rockin’ Curves Mascara.

Posing in her studded leathers and printed jeans, Kate works tousled locks, smokey eyes and a lot of attitude.

Back to her rock roots: Kate Moss, who is well known for her love of the festival scene and dating rock stars, pulls off the look with aplomb in her latest Rimmel beauty campaign

In one shot she can be seen applying her mascara in the reflection of a jukebox and in another she stands with a group of grungy, tattooed rockers.

Speaking about Kate's latest gig, a spokesperson for Rimmel said: 'No one does edgy rock chick style like 
Rimmel ambassador Kate Moss, making her the perfect face of ScandalEyes 
Rockin’ Curves. 

'In the striking print advertising campaign, Kate gives 
it some serious attitude with tousled hair, pouting lips, huge rock doll
 lashes and a studded leather vest that is to die for. She’s rockin’ the
 London look.'

Speaking about their latest product, the beauty brand say: 'Winter’s fierce retro-rock trend demands a wild-child lash look. Get ready to rock lashes with a fierce and vivid black shade.'

Working until the last minute: Notoriously hardworking Kate managed to squeeze in one more beauty campaign ahead of her 40th birthday

'Celebrated for her 
beauty and her remarkable career as a model, Kate Moss has consistently 
set the benchmark to which others aspire,' reads Rimmel's website.

London-born Kate, who was spotted at JFK at the age of 14 and is one of
 the most iconic models of this century, started working with the 
company back in 2001.

In 2011 Kate created and launched her 
successful Kate Moss for Rimmel lipstick range, since followed up by a 
number of equally popular collections.

She's recently been joined by the likes of Georgia May Jagger and Rita Ora as brand ambassadors for Rimmel.

It
 has been a busy year for Kate, who has fronted campaigns for St. 
Tropez, posed on numerous glossy magazine covers, designed a 
phone accessories collection for Carphone Warehouse - and even posed naked on the cover of Playboy magazine.

The mother is currently enjoying some much needed downtime ahead of her 40th birthday.

Long-time pal Sir 
Richard Branson has generously donated the use of his Necker Island to 
Kate for the week - which usually costs £280,000.

Georgia May Jagger wore fun 80s-inspired ensembles to attend Rimmel's 180 Years Of Cool party at the London Film 
Museum last month

The mother-of-one has flown into the Caribbean hideaway with husband Jamie Hince ahead of her 40th birthday on Thursday.

Joining Kate are close friends designer Sadie Frost, hairdresser James Brown, PR Fran Cutler and socialite Annabelle Nielson, according to the Sunday Mirror.

A source told the Mirror: 'Kate
 didn’t want the fuss and bother of London and the drama and paparazzi 
that comes along with it. She’s decided to celebrate in private.

'It’ll be wild though – guests have been told to bring fancy-dress clothing, party gowns as well as beachwear.'

Luxury: Necker island, where Kate will be staying for her 40th birthday celebrations, normally costs £280,000 a week to hire
