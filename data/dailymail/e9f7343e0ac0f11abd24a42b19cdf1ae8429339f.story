As the dust settles from the New England Patriots Super Bowl win on, conspiracy theories have begun to circulate about just why Pete Carroll didn't use the obvious ace up his sleeve.

The Seattle head coach has taken  responsibility for the call in the dying moments of the game when the Seahawks ran a passing play, with quarterback Russell Wilson trying to find receiver Ricardo Lockette.

Patriots corner Malcolm Butler read that play perfectly, timed his move and made the interception to assure a fourth Super Bowl title for the Patriots.

Conspiracy? Commentators are reporting a theory that Seahawks coach chose Russell Wilson, left, to be the star of his final play over Marshawn Lynch, right, because Lynch is not as media friendly

'Derek Jeter with a Bible': Wilson is seen greeting fans and airline employees on the team's return from the Super Bowl at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport following their defeat

But now questions have been asked about why, with his team on the one-yard line and needing a touchdown to win, he didn't tell Wilson to hand the ball back to star running back Marshawn Lynch.

The flames of conspiracy are thought to have been fanned by at least one voice from the Seahawks locker room, who refused to discount the theory that Carroll 'had a vested interest in making Wilson, rather than Lynch, the hero.'

'That's what it looked like,' the anonymous player told NFL.com's Mike Silver in the immediate aftermath of the match. In The Nation, sports correspondent Dave Zirin quoted a second anonymous Seahawk who told him: '[I] can't believe it. We all saw it. They wanted it to be Russ. They didn't want Marshawn to be the hero.'

The suggestion is that Carroll chose Wilson over Lynch because of Lynch's open defiance of the media and of the league as well as, controversially, his unapologetic black masculinity.

Twice before Lynch has been fined $50,000 by the NFL for refusing to speak to reporters and was fined another $20,000 for making an obscene gesture after scoring a touchdown in the Seahawks' NFC championship game win over Green Bay Packers.

Last week, on Super Bowl media day, the 28-year-old player answered all 25 questions he was fielded with exactly the same answer: 'I'm just here so I won't get fined.'

Then, after the debacle of the game itself, his reputation seemed confirmed as he barged past news cameras on his way out of the University of Phoenix stadium without even a  word of comment.

As Jamil Smith put it in New Republic: 'Unsurprisingly, a lot of folks in the league and in the media haven’t been able to deal, slapping Lynch with what Mychal Denzel Smith called recently the “unapologetically black tax,” exacted upon black people in public life who are unwilling to kowtow to largely white critics.'

Later, Smith writes: 'Lynch manifests a kind of public black masculinity that actively challenges and offends the stoic, team-first athlete the NFL still blindly idealizes.'

Zirin echoes those suspicions in his analysis for The Nation, adding: 'Russell Wilson is your young clean-cut God-fearing media-perfect quarterback. If one was creating a superstar face to market for the twenty-first century, chances are they would look, sound and basically be Russell Wilson.

'He's Derek Jeter with a Bible, someone who comes across like he has never spoken out of turn in his entire life.'

The conspiracy theory goes that Carroll thought that, with the final play was in the bag, it was much better to give that fairytale Super Bowl moment to Wilson rather than Lynch.

As Zirin writes: 'The politics of race, respectability, public relations and what's in the best interest of a $2billion corporation all played into this. That's the theory.'

Carroll himself has tried to explain the decision that many say cost the Seahawks the Super Bowl by saying they they didn't want to run against their goal line defense and were planning on waiting until the third or fourth down to make the game-winning play. 

He therefore decided to 'waste' the play. 

Dejected: Pete Carroll is facing a backlash after making what some have called the 'worst play call ever' in the dying moments of the Super Bowl

Determined: Russell Wilson responded to the criticism on Monday after taking some of the blame for the play

He said: 'Really what happened, it was frankly really clear, we went to three receivers and they sent in their goal line people. We had plenty of downs and a time out and didn't want to run against their goal line people right there.

'I told my guys that's my fault totally. We had plenty of time to win the game. We were playing for third or fourth down, but it didn't work out that way.'

The decision to pass rather than give the ball to Lynch was instantly criticized by former players and analysts.

'That was the worst play call I've seen in the history of football,' tweeted Hall of Fame running back and three-time Super Bowl winner Emmitt Smith.

Seahawks coach Carroll was not surprisingly the man given the blame.

'That play call will haunt Pete for the rest of his career,' tweeted former Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens. 'Give the ball to Beastmode (Lynch) in that situation.'

Carroll said his thinking was that the Patriots had their run defense in place and with his wide receivers on the field, they were not well matched-up for a run play.

He added: 'It is a really clear thought but it didn't work out right. We happened to throw them the ball and they make a big play.

'At this time it seems like overthinking but they have extra guys at the line up scrimmage so we don't want to waste a run play on that,' he said.

'We make those decisions every game, all the time. They work out sometimes and they don't other times. This one didn't work out right for us.'

Wilson agreed. 'We had a good play. If it was a catch, it would be a completely different story. I thought it was going to be a touchdown when I threw it. I thought it was going to be game over,' he said.

Carroll said he and Wilson had shared a moment of disbelief at the end of the game.

'We just looked at each other trying to realize the gravity of what we just witnessed. We didn't say very much'.

Some of the Seahawk players however disagreed. Linebacker Bruce Irvin told NFL.com he did not understand the call as they have 'the best back in the league'.
