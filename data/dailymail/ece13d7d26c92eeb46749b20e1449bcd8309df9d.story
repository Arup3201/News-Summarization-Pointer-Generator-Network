A magistrate has warned that Britain's 'soft touch' justice system will turn householders into vigilantes after his own home was torn apart by burglars.

Abid Sharif, 36, said 'every man should have the right to defend his castle' after he returned home from picking up a pair of airline tickets to discover it had been broken into, trashed and looted of valuables including his wedding ring.

During the daylight raid, a rear window was torn from off its hinges with a crowbar before the gang climbed into the house, breaking a dining table.

Abid Sharif a magistrate from Burnley, Lancashire whose house was burgled in broad daylight said criminals 'just don't care' about offending

They tore doors off wardrobes and cupboards before stealing the gold jewellery, a watch and electrical goods including a PlayStation 3, a Sony laptop, a Samsung mobile phone and a digital camera.

Mr Sharif later took pictures of the aftermath of raid which is said to have cost almost £10,000.

Today the father of three, a bus driver who sits one day a week at Burnley Magistrates' court in Lancs said: 'The levels of policing have gone down since the cutbacks and that's crazy when you hear about these public service executives being paid thousands.

'People will naturally want to protect their property but I fear they will then become vigilantes and will probably get done in court for it.

'If I had been in my house when these people came in and I had knocked one of them out I would be inside for assault and I don't think it's fair. Every man has a right to defend his castle and if we gave powers to the public I think the crime will drop.

'Within my job I see these criminals come before me and they seem to know more law than their solicitors about equal rights and human rights and they can get away with a lot of things.

'They know we can only give them a slap on the wrist, it's very frustrating for me - we want to throw the book at them but prison is regarded a last resort.

'We try fining them but then they say they can only pay £5 a week because they are on benefits.

'The laws have gone too lenient. In some cases everything points to custody but then they say they have medical problems and then they can't do paid unpaid work because they have a bad back. By the end its a conditional discharge.

The other day there were 16 cases and 11 of those where burglary either from a shop or a dwelling. I know when I sit again and a case like this comes up and I will be frustrated.

'Obviously I cannot and will not take my frustrations out on others in court but sometimes we walkaway from court disheartened - especially when you see the criminals go away laughing.'

It is thought the burglars had been circling Mr Sharif's neighbourhood in a car before stopping at his property and then knocking on his front door to establish he was not at home.

Police are now examining CCTV footage of the raid which was captured by cameras at a neighbouring property.

Mr Sharif whose wife was away in Pakistan at the time of the raid said: 'Obviously these criminals are not frightened and don't seem to care - given they just walked into my house off a busy road in broad daylight.

'I was out for less than an hour and when I came home about 2pm all the computer gear was on the floor. When I went upstairs, it was like a bomb had hit the place.

'The room was topsy-turvy, doors were hanging off, the bed was on its side, they had even used a knife and ripped the suitcases apart looking for gold.

'I even found a knife upstairs so they'd obviously been into the property with a knife. I'm just glad my wife wasn't in because they could have just barged past her and threatened her. I'm glad she didn't see it.

'CCTV cameras caught them outside the house in a blue Ford focus. They parked up and then an Asian knocked on the door and waited for about two or three minutes.

'The car was driven around and came back and another camera picked them up going on the backstreet. They were even pictured walking out of the property with the laptop and computer in their hands - it was sickening.

'They absolutely ransacked the place, it's very upsetting.

'I used to see a lot of police presence around here. Police cars would even be around at night time and you would feel safe - but it's not safe around here any more.

'The police presence used to be fantastic and you knew that there were there. Now I can't say that they are not doing their job right if they don't have the funding.

'We used to see a bobby on the beat every day and we used to know him. Now I don't know who the local bobby is.

'I think even the police are frustrated because they have such a high workload and different teams. When they should be out investigating a burglary they are stuck doing paperwork and can't do it.

'Victim support rang me up -but I don't want that. I want the police to find the burglars. I have since been sleeping in the back room since it happened in case they come in again.'

Clive Grunshaw, Police and Crime Commissioner for Lancashire, said: 'Keeping people safe, especially those who are most vulnerable, remains my utmost priority.

'Both the Chief Constable and I remain committed to neighbourhood policing and recognise their vital presence in building safe and confident communities.'

Lancashire Police said: 'Anyone with information should call us.'
