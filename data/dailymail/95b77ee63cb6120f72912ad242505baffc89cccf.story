Terry Brown claims he was attacked and hounded out of his home by a vigilante mob after spending a year on bail falsely accused of rape 

A man was stabbed and attacked by a mob when he was wrongly accused of rape, and claims his partner suffered a miscarriage after a gang hounded the couple over the false allegations.

Terry Brown, 33, was forced to flee his home town of Basildon in Essex after Lisa-Jayne Samuels falsely claimed he had drugged and raped her, and even picked him out of an ID parade. 

Samuels - who had made up the lies to get attention from her mother - was jailed for 20 months after she admitted perverting the course of justice but Mr Brown claims he was made a prisoner in his own home while he spent a year on bail for the false allegations. 

In one incident Mr Brown and his partner, Tracey Choularton, 25, were surrounded by a gang as they left their home and as Ms Choularton tried to flee she tripped and fell. She later suffered a miscarriage.  

Mr Brown was frequently targeted by angry mobs and the home he shared with his partner was daubed with graffiti on a daily basis, branding him 'scum' and a 'rapist.'

'We had to barricade ourselves into the house as we were terrified,' said Mr Brown, speaking after Samuels, a mother-of-four, was jailed for the lies. 

'I walked outside my house once and a group of lads just jumped me and started hitting me with fence panels that had nails sticking out.

'I was left with puncture wounds in my back and they smashed out my teeth. Eventually we had to leave Basildon as I just didn't feel safe there.

'Everyone had branded me a rapist because I had been arrested so they decided I must be guilty.'

Mr Brown now lives on Canvey Island, Essex, with Ms Choularton, 25.

'I've never been the same since really - I still have nightmares and can't go back to Basildon even though it's my home town as I just don't feel safe, he added.

'I'm on anti-depressants and I haven't worked since this all started.

'I'm a plasterer by trade but just can't do it anymore as I am constantly shaking.'

In one incident Ms Choularton said the couple were surrounded by a gang of 20 people near their home in Basildon, who were accusing Mr Brown of raping Samuels. 

Mr Brown and his partner Tracey Choularton claim they were surrounded by a gang who confronted him over the fake rape claims, and Ms Choularton fell over as she fled the group. She later suffered a miscarriage 

She said: 'We were just walking down the road one morning in Basildon and a gang of around 20 people just came out of nowhere.

'I tried to run but tripped on a curb.

'We managed to get back to the house but I was bleeding a lot.

'We couldn't call an ambulance as the house was surrounded so we had to wait for them to leave before we could.

'Because of her allegations I lost my baby. I just wish she understood the pain and upset her actions have caused. Terry still blames himself for the loss of our baby which is awful for him.'

Samuels was jailed for 20 months when she appeared at Basildon Crown Court on Friday. 

It emerged that the 29-year-old had falsely cried rape twice before.  

The court heard that she had police draw up an e-fit based on her bogus claims and had picked Mr Brown out of an ID parade.

Her false claims saw 80 hours of police time wasted during the investigation.  

Samuels, of Southend, Essex, called 999 at 1am on October 10, 2012, claiming to have been raped at the town's cliffs.

She told police her drink had been spiked by her attacker, who she knew from a shelter. Eventually when CCTV showed no evidence of her being in the pub she claimed and her friends proved fictitious she admitted lying - after Mr Brown had already spent a year on bail.   

Recorder Anthony Abell said: 'The consequences for Mr Brown have been catastrophic.

'He has had 'dirty scummy rapist' graffitied on his home, been attacked by a gang of thugs with a large piece of wood so that he could not speak for a couple of days and he blames himself for the loss of a child.

'He was prevented from seeing his two elder children and got so scared he sought help to move away from the area.' 

Samuels was jailed and all her children were taken into care.
