Burberry won the social media battle at London Fashion Week this month, generating over 21,000 mentions on Facebook, Twitter and other blogs.

But while two thirds of the comments were about the label's clothes, 25 per cent focused on One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles, who took pride of place on the front row beside burlesque star Dita von Teese.

Burberry's stellar guest list - including TV presenter and model, Alexa Chung, and Paralympic champion Johnnie Peacock - was a major part of the appeal, according to business information group Precise.

The brand enjoyed double the exposure of 
its nearest rival, Topshop, whose Unique show attracted around 10,000 
mentions.

Unlike Burberry, however, most of the conversations about 
Philip Green's label were fashion-focused.

In terms of social networks, Twitter was the most popular site for fashion commentators, followed by blogs and Facebook.

Burberry and Topshop racked up the 
largest number of tweets - with 20,924 and 9,161 respectively - Vivienne
Westwood came next with 3,031, followed by Matthew Williamson in fourth
with 2,228, and Erdem in fifth with 1,402.

Burberry and Topshop also came first 
and second when comments on all blogs were taken into account, while 
third place was taken by Philip Treacy and Lady Gaga, with 8,000 between
them.

Fourth and fifth places went to Greek-born designer Mary 
Katrantzou, who accrued 2,700 comments, and Henry Holland's House of Holland, which racked up 
2,500.

Singer Lady Gaga attracted over 5,000 
mentions on social networking sites in the wake of her appearance on the
catwalk at Philip Treacy, although the designer himself only received 
3,000.

James Withey, Head of Brand Insight at Precise said: 'The massive 
growth in social media buzz around this year' event shows how important
social media now is to the fashion world.

'Where once a brand could rely on having a few key editors on-side, today's arbiters of a brand's success or failure are the thousands of enthusiasts who follow them closely.

'This year's exhibitors will doubtless be pleased to know that over 95 percent of the posts we have tracked over the past week were positive.'

He continued: 'What also stood out about this year's event was the extent to which the 'front row celebrities' have shaped these conversations – even overtaking the brand completely at times.

'Will such big spikes help these brands cement their reputations with target consumers? Only time will tell.

'Meanwhile, it has been encouraging to see many up-and-coming designers harnessing social media with a different rule book – using their events to widen the awareness and appeal of their work.'

Rulers of the runway: Topshop's Unique show, left, racked up 9,161 tweets, while Burberry's Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey, right, was surely pretty pleased with 20,924.

Burberry's social media success comes in the wake of Victoria Beckham's triumph at New York Fashion Week.

Beckham racked up a whopping 57,000 new Twitter followers over the five-day event, and was mentioned 17,173 times on social networking sites.

Also popular in New York was Louis Vuitton supremo Marc Jacobs, whose show for his eponymous line resulted in 8,813 mentions.

Veteran designer Diane von Furstenburg came in third place with 8,608 tweets, followed by Alexander Wang with 6,767.
