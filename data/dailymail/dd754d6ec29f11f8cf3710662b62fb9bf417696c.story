Neglected: Mr Hands was made to sit for hours in hospital after he feared he was having a stroke

An 80-year-old widower who raised thousands of pounds for a hospital has spoken of his anger at being left in a waiting room for most of the night after suffering from a suspected stroke.

Charity worker Ron Hands, who has raised over £100,000 for his local hospital, phoned the emergency services after he woke in the middle of the night with a swollen face and his mouth drooping.

Fearing he had suffered a stroke he called an ambulance and was taken to Bournemouth General Hospital, Dorset.

It was here that Mr Hands was made to sit in a wheelchair in the waiting room for the majority of the night, as staff attended to a number of drunk patients before assisting him.

Mr Hands, who worked tirelessly for 33 years to raise money for the hospital which had treated his wife before she died of pancreatic cancer, was left stunned with the way he was treated after arriving at the hospital.

The retired hotel doorman, who resides in Southbourne, Bournemouth, said he was so distressed by the way he was treated he has written to the CEO of the hospital demanding pensioners be dealt with in a more considerate way.

Mr Hands said he does not want any other pensioners to be treated the way he was and spent a sleepless night watching drunk people being seen to by staff at Bournemouth General Hospital, Dorset.

He said: 'I was really scared. I’d recently had tests for deep vein thrombosis and my first thought was that I might have had a stroke.'

Mr Hands was given a brief examination at the A&E department of the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, but was then left sitting in a wheelchair in the waiting room for four hours from 2.30am to 6.30am, when he was finally seen by a doctor.

'It was horrible just sitting there on my own frightened about what was wrong with me,' said Mr Hands.

'The receptionist did come and offer me a cup of tea at about 5.00am, but other than that the only other people there were some girls who’d been on a hen night.

'One of their mates had something wrong with her eye and they were all a bit drunk. It wasn’t very nice.'

Hours later, Mr Hands was eventually told that he probably had a dental abscess and was discharged with antibiotics and the promise of a letter to his GP.

Former doorman at the town’s four star Royal Bath Hotel, Mr Hands started the Mary Hands Trust in 1989 after Mary, his wife of 33 years, died of pancreatic cancer.

For the next 20 years he raised more than £100,000 for hospital equipment in the name of the trust.

It is believed that at least £75,000 of that money helped pay for equipment, including a scanner at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital.

Mr Hands finally called a halt to his charity work in 2009 saying he was leaving it to the younger generation to continue the fundraising work.

Sitting in his modest flat a week after his ordeal and looking through letters of thanks that he had received from the hospital over the years, Mr Hands said: 'I certainly don’t think I should have received any special treatment but it’s awful that anyone is put through this kind of thing.

'I’m not someone who makes a fuss and I’m certainly not a hypochondriac. I really was worried about what was wrong with me.

'Being left sitting there for hours in the middle of the night I was thinking "If my wife could see me now." It was hurtful.'

Now Ron has written to Tony Spotswood, the Chief Executive of the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, outlining his ordeal and asking him to investigate.

In a direct plea he has asked 'Please Mr Spotswood to save this happening again to other elderly patients I think that just a little more consideration for the not so able should be looked into.'

There has currently been no reply from Mr Spotswood, whose organisation’s motto is 'Putting patients first'.
