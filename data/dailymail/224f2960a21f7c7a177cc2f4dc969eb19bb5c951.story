The parents of an eight-year-old boy thought he was suffering from 'growing pains' when he was actually dying of scurvy, an inquest has heard.

Dylan Seabridge collapsed  at the family home in the remote village of Eglwyswrw in Pembrokeshire, west Wales in December 2011.

After his death it emerged he had the rare condition - almost unheard of in modern-day Britain - which is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C.

Glynn and Julie Seabridge thought their son Dylan was suffering from growing pains before he died of scurvy

His parents Glynn, 47, and Julie had not sought medical advice for the youngster because they thought he was  suffering from 'growing pains', it emerged today.

Former teacher Mrs Seabridge, 46, and her husband were both unemployed and home schooling their son at the time of his death.

She had taught IT in a secondary school until 2009, when she left her post due to ill health. 

An inquest in Milford Haven heard how Mr Seabridge called 999 on 6 December 2011 after the boy's health deteriorated.

Paramedics who attended the family home found Dylan unconscious and not breathing with bruising to his ankle and knee as well as swollen legs.

He was rushed to hospital but suffered a heart attack and doctors were unable to save him.

The parents rejected a Home Office pathologist's conclusion that the rare condition - caused by lack of vitamin C - was to blame, but a coroner has today found scurvy killed Dylan

Home Office pathologist Dr Deryck Simon Jones, who carried out the post mortem examination, concluded that Dylan's death was due to scurvy.

Scurvy was at one time common among sailors deprived of fresh fruit and vegetables while at sea but is now incredibly rare.

Symptoms of scurvy are lethargy, spots on the skin, spongy gums and bleeding from the nose.

Treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating food that is high in the essential vitamin such as cabbage, grapefruit, sweet potatoes, lemons, broccoli, limes and tomatoes.

NHS guidance says the condition should be treated quickly to reverse its harmful effects.

The parents, who were not present at today's hearing, reject this finding. Their lawyer, Katie Hanson, told the inquest: 'The parents don't accept that Dylan died of scurvy.'

A specialist from Belgium, Professor Joris Dlanghe, also questioned whether Dylan had scurvy claiming that other deficiencies such as folic acid would have been present too but were not.

Dylan's parents had given their son painkillers for his 'growing pains' shortly before his death.

They were intially arrested and charged with neglect but the Crown Prosecution Service later dropped their case against them.

Pembrokeshire Coroner, Mark Layton, ruled that Dylan had died from scurvy and recorded an open conclusion.
