ARSENAL DON'T DESERVE RAMSEY... HE SHOULD PLAY ALONGSIDE BALE

BARKLEY, SHAW AND WICKHAM PROVE YOUNG TALENT CAN FLOURISH

Ryan Giggs has been a joy to watch and part of me was saddened when he announced his retirement – I was disappointed I wouldn’t be able to see him play again.

But I bet deep down he wonders what might have happened had he moved away from Manchester United.

By the turn of the century he had already won everything he could win at United. He was winning medals season after season, nobody questioned his greatness.

Retirement: Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs announced his retirement after a 24-year playing career

Won it all: Giggs may wonder what would have happened had he moved away from Manchester United earlier - he had won everything there is to win with the club by the turn of the century

Only Giggs could change that but he chose not to. Was that loyalty? Maybe. But it’s not hard to be loyal to a club paying you handsomely and dominating trophies.

David Beckham left the comfort zone of Old Trafford and won titles for Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.

Among the greats who were winning trophies but still chose the brave option and changed clubs and countries are Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo (both Brazilian and Portuguese versions), Ronaldinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Move: David Beckham left United and won League titles with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain

Winner: Giggs eventually won 34 major honours with United, including 13 league titles, the last in 2013

So in his mid-20s, after creating history and winning the Treble with United, what was stopping Giggs leaving his legacy and legend status at United totally intact and moving to another European giant to do it all again at a different club? There would have been no shortage of takers.

I guess the comfort zone is hard to leave.

And in turn it makes me wonder how Giggs will be viewed by his new manager Louis van Gaal. Some have suggested the decision to make Giggs assistant manager was made for Van Gaal, rather than instigated by him.

New boss: Louis van Gaal has made Giggs his new assistant manager at Old Trafford

Experience: Patrick Kluivert (right) can draw on more experience than Giggs having played in five countries

The new boss will appreciate the inside information on the club culture at Old Trafford I’m sure. But David Moyes had similar input at his disposal and look what happened to him. I don’t think getting the gossip on who Giggs likes and doesn’t like at United will be high on the new manager’s list of priorities.

The real issue is this: can Giggs have the all-round knowledge and experience to bring much else to the job?

Compare his experience with that of Van Gaal’s current assistant with the Dutch national team.

Transition: Giggs has made the move to the coaching staff but deciding to stay rather than moving on when he was younger means the Welshman's place among the very best is in doubt

Patrick Kluivert played in five different countries, experiencing great success, as well as disappointment. I’m not saying Kluivert was a greater player than Giggs, but he can draw on a broader football experience in his coaching career.

Giggs could have done all that, but he chose not to.

He will be a Manchester United great, and a Premier League legend, but his place among the greats of Europe isn’t certain.
