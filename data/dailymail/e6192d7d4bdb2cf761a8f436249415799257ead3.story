Mario Balotelli could not inspire Liverpool to a comeback victory over Manchester United on Sunday when he was introduced at half-time for Adam Lallana, and was denied his first Premier League goal for the club  by an array of spectacular David de Gea saves.

Liverpool trailed 2-0 at the interval and went on to lose 3-0 at Old Trafford through goals from Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie but the away side had found moments of attacking joy against United's defence prior to Balotelli coming on.

And he was unfortunate not to halve Liverpool's deficit when he blasted a pass from Raheem Sterling goalwards from ten yards, only for De Gea to brilliantly tip it onto the crossbar on 68 minutes.

And De Gea denied him again on 82, when Balotelli swivelled and shot low after receiving the ball from Joe Allen, only for the Spain goalkeeper to dive low to his right and claim the ball. 

But Balotelli's duel with De Gea had not finished.

Moments later, he steered the ball goalwards again from a low ball into the United area, only for De Gea to smother any sight of the target the former Manchester City man had.

Balotelli tried to test De Gea with an acrobatic kick but was unable to connect properly with the bal

The Italy international had been lucky to escape a yellow card for hauling down Van Persie on 52 minutes, and was  booked for the same thing involving Jonny Evans twenty minutes later.

Had the Liverpool man seen yellow from referee Martin Atkinson for bringing down Van Persie, who had rifled in United's third a minute before the incident involving Evans, Balotelli would have almost definitely been sent-off for fouling the defender.
