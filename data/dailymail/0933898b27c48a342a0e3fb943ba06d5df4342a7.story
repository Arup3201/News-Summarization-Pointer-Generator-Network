Last week, Theresa May was pictured sporting sassy knee-high boots and a rather eye-catching coat that could hardly be described as conservative.

The Home Secretary took further sartorial steps at her party's conference earlier this month where she turned heads in a £1,190 Vivienne Westwood tartan suit, leading to comparisons being drawn between her and Cara Delevingne, who wore the exact same look a few months earlier.

But the 57-year-old MP has laughed off similarities between herself and the 21-year-old supermodel, who she describes as one of the most 'beautiful' women in the world.

Sole mates: Theresa May may have been pictured last week in a pair of racy boots just like some sported by Cara Delevingne, but the MP says she definitely doesn't share the model's style

Speaking as she collected the Spectator's Politician of the Year award last week, the 57-year-old said: 'This is the second good thing that's happened to me today because this morning, the Daily Mail asked: "Is Theresa May the new Cara Delevingne?"

'For
 those of you who don't know, she is 21, a supermodel and one of the 
most beautiful in the world - so I think we can safely say that the 
answer to that has to be filed by John Rentoul as a question, to which 
the answer is no.'

While May is hugely flattered by the comparisons, she's made it quite clear that she won't be hanging out with Miley Cyrus in a beanie or a cropped top anytime soon.

The former Minister for Women and Equalities may not believe she shares style credentials with Cara, but these images speak for themselves...
