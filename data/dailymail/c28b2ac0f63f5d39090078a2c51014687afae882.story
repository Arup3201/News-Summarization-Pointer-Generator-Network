Nick Clegg was left fuming when an award-winning TV journalist called him a ‘lying two-faced swine’ in front of an audience of children.

The incident occurred when Sky News foreign editor Sam Kiley played the part of the Lib Dem leader in a warm-up for an election programme at Sky’s Westminster studio.

Sitting in the host’s chair, Kiley, 50, said: ‘Right, kids, I’m Nick Clegg – ask me a question.’

A girl in the audience, made up of children aged ten to 12, asked: ‘Why did you not keep your pledge on tuition fees?’

Kiley replied: ‘That’s because I’m a lying, two-faced swine,’ prompting gales of laughter from the children. 

But the newsman – who has survived several brushes with death over his 25-year career as a foreign reporter – had no idea that Clegg was standing behind a nearby camera and heard the jibe. He muttered sarcastically: ‘Thanks, Sam.’

One witness said: ‘Clegg looked thunderous but the children thought it was hilarious. And so did the adults who were there.’

A Sky insider said: ‘It was really unfortunate and Sam was horrified. He said it as a joke and didn’t mean it. Clegg shouldn’t have been allowed in while the warm-up was on. He looked very cheesed off.’
