Japan has reportedly struck a deal to sell millions of pounds worth of machinery to the Royal Navy.

Approving the move, the Japanese government said to would not violate Tokyo's policy against arms sales.

The gas turbine parts will be manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a name associated more around the world with top quality, high-speed motorcycles.

HMS Kent: The Japanese government said the deal will not contravene Tokyo's anti-arms selling policy because the gas turbines are 'not regarded as weapons'

The parts are to be produced for Rolls-Royce, which has a manufacturing co-operation arrangement with Kawasaki, and RR will then supply them to the navy, according to Japan's business daily Nikkei and Kyodo News.

'The parts are not regarded as weapons,' said a government spokesman.

'They are to be used in navy ships as well as in civilian aircraft and in emergency generators.'Â  No further comment was available today as Japan is enjoying a public holiday.

But Kawasaki has pointed out through Kyodo that it has been making the engine parts for its own naval defence force and other users under license from Rolls-Royce.

The report in Kyodo said Rolls-Royce stopped making the components for the Royal Navy but when replacements were needed the navy ordered them from Kawasaki.

The Royal Navy, said the report, asked Japan's naval defence force to examine whether the export of the parts would contravene Tokyo's policy against arms sales.

The Nikkei daily said Japan was looking to increase exports of such dual-use technology, which would help the the country's defence industry increase output and cut down on production costs.

Not weapons: Japan's giant helicopter destroyer DDH183 Izumo was launched in August this year. Under its constitution, Japan cannot sell weapons to communist states, countries subject to UN embargoes and nations involved in international conflicts

'Such exports can also help Japan forge stronger defence ties with friendly countries,' said the daily.

A policy adopted in 1967, and strengthened nine years later, resulted in Japan prohibiting weapons sales to communist states, countries which are subject to embargoes under UN resolutions and nations involved in international conflicts.

Such ban, on the face of it, would seem to involve Britain, which still has troops in Afghanistan.

But one country which would have no hope of receiving machinery of any kind from Japan is its belligerent neighbour, North Korea.
