Gary Neville doubts whether Swansea's powerhouse striker Wilfried Bony is the right fit for title chasing Manchester City.

Manuel Pellegrini's side are closing in on a £30million deal to sign the Ivory Coast international, who is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Bony top scored in the Premier League through 2014, beating Wayne Rooney and possible future City team mates Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure.

'I worry about the purchase of Wilfried Bony, who is a very fine centre-forward but is not certain to add the kind of intricacy and ferocious intensity they found in the Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez partnership,' Neville told The Telegraph.

Neville added that City, who are unbeaten in the Premier League since the end of October, need greater consistency across all competitions to land titles year on year. 

'The owners will want sustained success: back to back titles and a serious challenge for the Champions League. The quality to go again, go again and again,' said Neville.

'There is no doubt City are a good Premier League team. However, for them to be an outstanding team they will have to acquire the consistent intensity you see at the two Madrid clubs or Bayern Munich.'

The former Manchester United right back also claims that City, who play Everton on Saturday afternoon, are not at the level from when they won the Premier League in 2012 as they look to outgun table-toppers Chelsea.

'To my eyes they are not as good as when they first won the Premier League. The big question remains: can they handle success the season following a title win.

'The next two months will tell us whether Mourinho can get Chelsea back into the habit of killing teams off, and whether City can win year on year.'
