A six-year-old has been dubbed 'catgirl' after a rare skin disease left her with soft 
black fur covering her back.

Zhao Xinrui's parents noticed a small patch of discoloured skin on her back about a year ago.

As the condition progressed, her horrified mother abandoned her daughter and husband, fleeing the village of Changshan near Luzhou City in southwest China's Sichuan province.

Zhao's grandmother, Zhao Henghui, said: 'Doctors told us it was just a birthmark - even when it started spreading - but now it covers half her body.'

Zhao Xinrui's parents first noticed a small patch of discoloured skin on their daughter's back around a year ago. Since then soft black fur has grown to cover her entire back and is starting the cover her arms and face

In order to make sure Zhao Xinrui was admitted to the family's local kindergarten, teachers told the other children she had a mole.

But she now requires urgent treatment to remove the hair, which covers her entire back and is starting to grow on her arms and face.

'The poor girl - it breaks our hearts to see her suffer like this,' said her father Zhao Lai, 45.

He said his wife had abandoned him and his daughter and that he was trying to look after her together with his parents.

The three of them had been trying to raise money to pay for treatment.

He said: 'We were told that she couldn't have any operation anyway until she got to about five.

'But now she's old enough we don't have the money.

It is hoped Zhao Xinrui, pictured with her grandmother, will be able to have an operation soon, where doctors plan to replace the hairy skin with healthy skin from other parts of the youngster's body

'Despite the fact that we saved ever since we heard she would need it.'

In an interview with local TV, the youngster said her biggest ambition was to be cured so that she could wear summer clothes and even a swimming costume like her pals.

The media coverage has inspired some members of the public to donate money and it is now hoped the youngster will be able to get the operation she needs.

She has already been sent to the provincial capital Chengdu for medical treatments and the plan is to carry out an operation to try and replace the hairy skin with healthy skin from other parts of her body.
