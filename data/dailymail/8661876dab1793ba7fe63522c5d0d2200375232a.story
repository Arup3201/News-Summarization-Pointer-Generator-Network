A New York man started an online campaign this week to stop his mother's killers from being released from prison on parole.

Jason Minter was just 6 years old when he witnessed his mother's rape and murder 37 years ago.

His mother Bonnie Minter had brought him along to a friends house where his 3-year-old sister was on a playdate and the family walked in on a break-in.

Putting up a fight: Jason Minter was just 6 years old when he witnessed his mother's grisly murder. He is now attempting to block her killers from getting out of jail on parole

Samuel Ayala, James Walls and Willie Profit held Mrs Minter, her friend Sheila Watson and the children at gun point while they ushered them upstairs.

The men put the children in one bedroom while they took the women to the other, raped them and shot them dead.

Thought he was just a child, Mr Minter tried to fight back and protect his mother. But one of the men, Ayala, pushed a gun to his head and ordered: 'Shut the f*** up, kid'.

'The last words I heard my mother say were her begging for the life of her children,' Mr Minter wrote in an online campaign he launched last week.

While all three men were given life sentences after the crime, they came up for parole in 2002 and have been applying for release every two years since.

Campaign: Mr Minter currently owns Indian Road Cafe in Inwood, New York. As of Tuesday evening his campaign had nearly received its goal of 3,000 signatures

Up until now they have been unsuccessful but Mr Minter fears that Ayala may get out this time since his family has begun writing on his behalf.

'He personally raped my mother. He personally shot my mother. He laughed about it as he left the house,” Minter told the New York Post. 'I heard him as he got into the (getaway) van and joked about his sexual prowess.

'He thought it was funny,' Mr Minter added. 'He’s a monster who should never ever get out of prison.'

As of Tuesday night, Mr Minter's campaign had nearly reached it's goal of 3,000 signatures.

He hopes the petition will stop the parole question once and for all.

'To have to do this every two years is torturous,' Mr Minter told DNAinfo.
