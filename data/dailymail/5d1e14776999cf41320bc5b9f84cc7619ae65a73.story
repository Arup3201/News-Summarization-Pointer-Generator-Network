The patriarch of a Queensland family grieving after the alleged murder of eight children in Cairns has delivered a heartfelt public appeal for children to be cherished.

Rod Willie faced the media in Cairns for the first time since the mother of seven of the children and aunt to another, Raina Mersane Ina Thaiday, 37, was charged with eight counts of murder.

The four boys and four girls, aged between two and 14 years, were found dead in the home at Manoora last Friday.

Mr Willie - the grandfather of seven of the eight children - urged the public to band together during the Christmas period and 'hold dear such occasions with family and friends'.

Families needed to regularly offer and seek loving support from one another, he said.

'Children are the most vulnerable of our society whose innocent lives deserve the greatest of love and care,' he said.

'Cherish them.'

No date has been set for funeral ceremonies, but Mr Willie said the families would lay the victims to rest in Cairns early in the New Year.

The unprecedented tragedy had directly affected multiple families, Mr Willie says.

'We are working carefully and respectfully as immediate families, extended families and as a community, through a sensitive and cultural process to ensure our loved ones are respectfully put to rest,' he said, according to statement circulated by police on Wednesday.

'Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work through a very difficult process.' 

He said those affected by the tragedy had been offered tremendous support from community leaders and organisations, individuals, agencies, and the private and corporate sectors.

'Our priority focus to date has been very much towards supporting our traumatised family members, to meet our cultural protocols and to begin to consider extraordinary funeral arrangements,' he said.

On Sunday, the distraught father of the four youngest children massacred in Cairns could barely stand as he visited the memorial outside the home in which they were killed.

It was a heartbreaking scene as family members - including the children's maternal grandmother (above) - made their way up to a tree where tributes had been left for the young vicitms

Gavin Willie was carried to the tribute site by family members on Sunday, screaming and crying in anguish as he clutched the flowers he had brought to lay in tribute to the eight children that lost lives.

At one point Mr Willie collapsed to the ground, screaming the names of children, and had to be lifted by several men to a chair to be consoled by relatives.

‘Raiden’, ‘Rodney’, ‘Azza’ and ‘baby girl’, the father screamed over and over again in a rasping voice, while sobbing uncontrollably.

Family members mopped at his forehead with a wet cloth, desperate to do something to help the father in his distress.

Eventually they had to pick him up - his limbs hanging limp - and take him back to the family home to try and console him. 

Several men carried one of the fathers to the scene where he sat on a seat - weak and inconsolable

The maternal grandmother of seven of the children who were killed wailed: 'No! No! My babies, my babies!'

She was supported by other family members as she wailed, ‘they’re my grandchildren’, and had to be helped to place a yellow rose among the tributes.

A group of about 40 people - made up of the elderly, parents, young children and babies - were seen walking up the road, and were heard screaming and crying in distress and anguish.

They clutched flowers as they stumbled down the street to add to the growing pile - a symbol of the immense grief in the community for the lost lives of the little children. 

Police continue to collect evidence at the Murray Street home in Manoora - 4km away from Cairns

The mother of seven of the eight children was charged with eight counts of murder on Sunday in a bedside hearing, two days after they were found stabbed to death in a Manoora home on Murray Street. 

Warria - also known as Raina Thaiday - appeared before a magistrate at the Cairns Base Hospital where she is being treated for stab wounds to the chest, which were possibly self-inflicted.

She may never have to stand criminal trial if she is deemed mentally ill.

Her lawyer Steve McFarlane said she 'knows what has happened' but it 'hasn't sunk in yet’. He has requested her case be heard in the Mental Health Court, which has the power to decide if an alleged offender is permanently unfit to stand trial, The Australian reports. 

The community are shocked by the tragedy and pay their respects at a memorial nearby the Cairns home
