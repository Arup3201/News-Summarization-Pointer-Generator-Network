An argument about sex in a crowded restaurant ended with a millionaire businesswoman being bludgeoned to death in a five-star Paris hotel room, a court heard yesterday.

Ian Griffin, 45, broke down in tears as he described how his row with Kinga Legg, 36, escalated on what had otherwise been ‘a fantastic visit’ to the French capital.

On the second day of his murder trial at Paris Assizes, Griffin insisted that he had never intended to kill his fiancée.

Ian Griffin, 45, said former girlfriend Kinga Legg, 36, kept antidepressant pills from him in a bid to 'be intimate', before the couple got into a public row in which she demanded sex

But he admitted ‘cleaning up’ their £1,000-a-night room at the five-star Bristol Hotel for up to six hours while Miss Legg’s body was still in it.

Recalling the start of their vicious row at the Bound restaurant, off the Champs-Elysees, in May 2009, Griffin said it started when he said the medication he was on had dampened his libido.

Miss Legg shouted back: ‘You owe me sex.’ Not wanting an argument about his sex life in public, Griffin replied: ‘My God, not here!’

The couple, who had been due to marry in Monaco the following August, had agreed a pact in which Griffin was not allowed to contact former girlfriends.

But Miss Legg felt sexually frustrated and withheld eight of the anti-depressant pills Griffin was used to taking, in a bid to ‘be intimate with me’, said Griffin, who was left with just two pills.

‘She wanted sex and expressed it loudly, and when I asked her to be quiet she got even more angry, so I shouted “That’s it!”,’ said Griffin, who faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty of murder.

‘I was so upset too, as we were having a fantastic trip and it ruined everything in just one minute.’

Griffin (pictured alongside current fiancee Tracey Baker) said Ms Legg shouted 'you owe me sex' while they were dining in a restaurant in Paris in 2009, sparking a bitter row

The pair made their own way back to the Bristol, where, after a vodka in the bar, Griffin opened the door of their room, to be confronted by Miss Legg saying: ‘Why did you leave me alone? How dare you leave me alone in Paris.’

Griffin, originally from Warrington, Cheshire, had intended to return to Britain straight away, but instead the argument intensified, with furniture being broken and thrown about.

Griffin said ‘everything went black’ at that point, but ‘I woke up the next day, and looked at the room – it was terrible’.

Griffin says he argued with Ms Legg in the bedroom of the five-star Bristol Hotel, Paris (pictured), but blacked out. When he woke he claims he found blood on the sheets, but had no memory of attacking Ms Legg

‘I spent the day cleaning the room. I was going to get Kinga to smuggle in a vacuum cleaner.

‘I then called out her name. I unmade the bed because I thought she was between the mattresses. There was a big stain of blood. I didn’t know she wasn’t there. I thought she was in bed. I had no idea.

‘I was really messed up. I was in such a state. All I was thinking of was getting the room cleaned up. The TV was broken, everything was broken.’

He said when he finally saw Miss Legg’s body on the floor, his reaction was to ‘warm her up’ in the bath. ‘She was very cold,’ added Griffin.

He said he screamed: ‘Kinga, Kinga, Kinga, please don’t go, please don’t go.’

He added: ‘I didn’t know she was dead. It was confusing.

When Griffin found Ms Legg's body, he said he didn't realise she was dead at first, and put her in a bath to warm up while he placed a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door and cleaned the room

‘I moved her arm, but somehow thought if I put her in the bath it would warm her up. She was stiff.’

Asked by Judge Didier Safar if he had seen the photos of Miss Legg’s corpse, which was found floating in the bath and had 92 bruises on it, Griffin said: ‘No. I only noticed she had a black eye.’

Griffin claimed he did not think Miss Legg was dead until about six and a half hours after he woke up on May 24, the day after their restaurant meal.

The judge said: ‘That means you remained five or six hours in the presence of a corpse in a bedroom covered in blood’, to which Griffin replied: ‘Yes.’

Ms Legg was later found floating in the bathtub of the couple's £1,000-a-night room with almost 100 bruises covering her body (file picture)

When he finally realised she was dead, a tearful Griffin said: ‘I wanted to die. I couldn’t cope with what had happened.’ He thought of jumping out of the window of the fifth-floor room, but then decided he wanted to commit suicide ‘back home’ after seeing his parents for the last time.

The prosecution alleges that Griffin was ‘thinking lucidly’ because he put a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on the door of the room, and booked an extra two nights, before heading off in his Porsche 911.

Judge Safar said: ‘You did not want Kinga Legg’s body to be discovered before you had put sufficient distance between yourself and the Bristol.’ Griffin replied: ‘Yes.’

Miss Legg, a Pole who was briefly married to an English civil servant called Peter Legg and who also used her maiden name Wolf, regularly told friends about her ‘abusive relationship’ with Griffin.

The couple were briefly arrested in 2008 after Miss Legg attacked Griffin with a knife, but no charges were laid.

Griffin denies murder. The trial is expected to run until Friday.
