Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe is to boycott a meeting of African and EU leaders after his wife, who is famous for her lavish shopping sprees in Europe, was denied a European visa.

A foreign ministry official said the Zimbabwe leader, 90, would not be attending a mammoth EU-Africa summit in Brussels next week due to a 'disagreement on the composition of our delegation'.

Mugabe and his wife Grace, 48, remain targeted by an
 Europe-wide travel ban but the restriction can be suspended temporarily to allow
 the head of state to attend international forums.

Zimbabwe had earlier urged the African Union as a whole to boycott the summit after the EU refused to lift a ban on Grace Mugabe joining her husband's delegation.

Mrs Mugabe is famous for the shopping trips to Europe she would make before being placed under sanctions, and is often referred to as the First Shopper, rather than First Lady, at home in Zimbabwe.

As part of their plea for the African Union to shun the summit, Zimbabwe also complained about which politicians and heads of state had and hadn't been invited by the EU.

Foreign ministry spokesman Joey Bimha said the European Union had not invited Sudan and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic - a country that does not have international recognition.

Although the EU has refused to 
invite Sudan, a Brussels official said the African Union was free to 
independently invite its president, Omar al-Bashir.

The EU said AU chairman Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz (left) was free to independently invite Sudan's president Omar al-Bashir (right), despite the latter being wanted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide

 is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, crimes 
against humanity and genocide related to the conflict in the Darfur 
region of Sudan.

Zimbabwe also complained that Egypt had been invited to the meeting after the country was suspended from the African Union following last year's coup that saw The Muslim Brotherhood and President Mohammed Morsi ousted from power.

But diplomats in Brussels said they were confident there is 'no risk' of a pullout, despite Mugabe being named one of two African Union deputy chairmen in January, and Zimbabwe chairing the union next year - therefore leaving the country with more potential influence than usual.

The current chair of the African Union is Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.

'We have been discussing this for some 
time. We have reached agreement and Zimbabwe has been invited but no 
spouses have been invited,' the EU official said.

The
 EU ambassador to Harare, Aldo Dell'Ariccia, said Mrs Mugabe was told 
she should 'apply through the normal channels' when her request to 
accompany her husband was rejected.

'The EU is just following its legal framework and there can't be any movement from that position,' he added.

Power: In January Mugabe was named one of two African Union deputy chairmen, while next year Zimbabwe will chair the African Union. Both these factors leave the country with more potential influence than usual

A spokesman for Robert Mugabe said it was 'very strange' that the EU had decided not to allow his wife to attend the the April 2-3 summit, which gathers 90 nations from both continents, including 65 heads of state and government.

Speaking to the state-owned Herald newspaper, George Charamba added: 'What God has put together the EU is trying to separate... Do they expect the President to respect the EU and disrespect his own marriage?'

Rushweat Mukundu of the political 
think-tank Zimbabwe Democracy Institute said the row is just 'a symptom 
of poisoned relations' between Zimbabwe and the EU, 'and old wounds that
 are proving difficult to heal.'

Both sides should have taken 'a sober approach' to resolving their long standing differences, suggested Mukundu.
