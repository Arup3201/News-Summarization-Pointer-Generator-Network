A High
Court judge told of his 'frustration' after an Arab prince failed to appear at a court hearing to settle a dispute over an alleged secret marriage with an
Egyptian model.

Nivin
el-Gamal, 35, told Mr Justice Bodey yesterday that she married Sheikh Ahmed
bin Saeed al-Maktoum, chairman of Emirates Airlines, at a ceremony in
London four years ago.

She wants
the judge to rule that a marriage took place, declare it null and void and
therefore put her in a position to claim maintenance.

But just moments before Sheikh Ahmed, whose airline sponsors Arsenal, was due to give evidence, his lawyer claimed his client had been ordered to stay in
Dubai by the country's ruler to attend a political meeting.

Nivin el-Gamal (pictured outside the High Court 
yesterday), 35, told Mr Justice Bodey that she married Sheikh Ahmed bin 
Saeed al-Maktoum (seen right at site of an Emirates hotel project in Australia) at a ceremony in London four years ago

His counsel Martin
Pointer QC said he was 'unable to attend' as he had 'no practical choice' but to attend the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit (GCC) in Riyadh.

Sheikh
Ahmed, who is a member of the royal family of Dubai, has denied the claim made by Miss el-Gamal and said no ceremony
took place.

Mr
Pointer said the case would continue without his client's
oral evidence.

The judge
said: 'Why
is it suddenly sprung on the court on Monday morning seconds before he comes
into the witness box?

'Provision could have been
made for a video link.'

'He
is unable to attend to give evidence,' said Mr Pointer. 'He has been
recalled by the ruler of Dubai to attend the GCC meeting in Riyadh.'

Mr Pointer
added: 'My client intends no disrespect at all to your lordship by not
being here.'

Richard Todd QC for Miss el-Gamal who claims she married the Sheikh in a
secret ceremony in January 2007 said it was 'a very dramatic development
indeed'.

He added: 'We are frankly
dumbfounded by this turn of events.'

Mr Pointer, who said the Sheikh would not now be coming to England to give
evidence, then began his final legal submissions claiming there was 'no
evidence' that the 'marriage' ever took place, apart from the 'self-serving evidence' from Miss el-Gamal.

Sheikh Ahmed's lawyer claimed that his client had been ordered by his uncle, the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum (above), to attend a summit in Riyadh

There was no independent record and no evidence from the Imam who was said to
have conducted the service or from the witnesses who were said to be there.

Last week, Miss el-Gamal was branded a liar
who invented the 'marriage' in a bid to get £1million a year
maintenance from him.

In
what Mr Todd described as 'the case of the Prince and the
pauper', she is seeking a declaration that the 'marriage' should be declared null and void.

But the Sheikh
denies they were ever married although they did meet for sex and have a
three-year-old son born in the U.S. in April 2008.  

The Sheikh, worth an
estimated £19billion, is the uncle of Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin
Rashid.

Mr Pointer claimed she was only an 'irregular' sexual
partner of the Sheikh and 'had a fantasy that he would marry you'.

But Miss el-Gamal
claims she bought a traditional wedding dress from Harrods in 2003 to have
pictures taken of the occasion - although because it was a secret wedding he told
her to dress simply, and the dress hung in her wardrobe for years.

Mr Todd told Mr Justice Bodey that the Sheikh also gave her a
£30,000 dowry and 34,000 Egyptian pounds to buy a gold wedding ring with 17
diamonds. He also gave her a Bulgari watch.

But he added that
after they split up, she was living on benefits of £110 a week and had to
sell the ring and watch to make ends meet.

He said the Sheikh had since been making interim maintenance payments to her
and their son.

Mr Todd said the couple first met in
Dubai in 2003.

Their relationship ended at the beginning of 2005 but they met
again in April 2006 and resumed their relationship.

The daughter of a prominent Egyptian businessman said the Sheikh first claimed
he asked her to marry him in a telephone call from Dubai, and they married in
December 2006. 

But later she changed the marriage date to January 11, 2007 at
his flat in Lowndes Square, Knightsbridge.

Mr Pointer said to her in the witness box: 'You were not his girlfriend
were you? You just met irregularly and had sex together.'

But she insisted: 'No we had a relationship.'

Sheikh Ahmed is chairman of Emirates Airlines, which sponsors Arsenal

But when Mr Pointer said they never went out in London, to the theatre , cinema
, or to parties or dinner parties , she said it was their culture that men had
a 'separate life' to their women, who did as they were told.

She said that was why she never wore the wedding dress she brought to the
wedding ceremony, because he wanted it kept secret and told her to dress
simply.

She claims the
marriage took place before an Imam and two witnesses at his flat after he told
her 'he was really in love with me and wanted to get married'.

She claimed in a witness statement that the
witnesses had signed a paper after the marriage.

But when Mr Pointer said this
was a lie, she admitted it was 'untrue'.

Mr
Pointer claimed they only met up for sex 'after which he gave you sums of
money'.

She said he did give her money and gifts but she also bought him gifts because
of the relationship they had. She denied seeing other men .

She claimed she bought the Sheikh a
number of gifts including a £7,000 Louis Vuitton diamond necklace, a £24,000
Cartier watch, cufflinks, pyjamas from Harrods and a coffee machine.

Miss el-Gamal admitted
she had one other boyfriend while they were apart between 2005 and 2006.

She
said she had a lot of friends but no other sexual relationships during this
time.

She also maintained she was still a Muslim after Mr Pointer said
she was now following the Jewish religion Kabbalah.

Nivin el-Gamal claims she bought a wedding dress from Harrods in 2003 to have pictures taken for her 'marriage'. She also claims to have bought Sheikh Ahmed a number of gifts, including pyjamas from the store

Mr Todd told the judge she believed
she had gone through a proper and valid marriage with the Sheikh.

But the relationship broke down in 2008 after he announced he was marrying a
cousin in Dubai.

She claims he telephoned her in July 2008 and did a Talak
divorce [by repeating the phrase 'I divorce you' three times] over the telephone saying they were now divorced.

Miss el-Gamal claimed the marriage ceremony took about 30 minutes before the Imam.

She
said two people who worked for him acted as witnesses. But nothing was written
down because he wanted it kept secret.

The judge said the question for him was not whether it was valid , because it
was not under English law, but whether anything happened at all.

If
there was no marriage then it would have financial consequences for Miss el-Gamal.

Mr Todd said it was her belief that they were married under Islam and that it
would be recognised as valid in English law.

The judge commented if it did
not meet the requirements of English law it would be a void marriage.

He
also commented on the 'eye-watering' legal costs being run up by the
case.   

The judge is only being asked to decide whether there was a
marriage at this stage. All questions of maintenance will be dealt with at
further hearings next year.

Lawyers
are due to conclude legal argument at a hearing in London tomorrow and expect
the judge to make a decision in the next few days.
