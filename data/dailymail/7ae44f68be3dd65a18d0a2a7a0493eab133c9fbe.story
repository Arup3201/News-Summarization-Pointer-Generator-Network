Custody: Tameka Raymond, pictured in court last August, has re-launched her bid for full custody

Usher's ex-wife Tameka Raymond has filed for custody of their two children following Monday's pool accident which left their five-year-old Usher V in a coma.

Tameka, who divorced the 34-year-old singer in November 2009, filed legal documents on Tuesday asking for an emergency hearing on grounds Usher is allegedly creating a 'dangerous environment' for the children.

According to TMZ, the documents were filed in Fulton County, Georgia, and ask for the hearing to take place later this week. 

Tameka is seeking decision-making power over the children's education, healthcare, religion and extracurricular activities.

She is allegedly claiming Usher is 'abdicating' his parental responsibilities by letting other people care for their two children,' report the website.

She is also said to be doubtful of the people Usher leaves in charge of looking after the children - Usher Jr and four-year Naviyd.

Apparently Usher's aunt - Rena Oden - was in charge of watching the youngster when his arm got stuck in the pool drain on Monday which led him to be rushed to intensive care, say TMZ.

Tameka believes that Oden was 'not on the ball' when the incident occurred.

In her documents, she also claims that Usher is '85% of the time out of town' and therefore delegates the care of the children to other people.

According to Tameka, the singer's family members have been looking after her children because The Voice judge continues to fire nannies that were previously on staff.

Usher currently has primary custody while Tameka has limited custodial rights after their split, but now she is seeking to reverse the situation.

Usher Raymond V is currently being 
treated in the ICU at an Atlanta, Georgia hospital after his arm got 
caught in the drain of a pool at the star's home early Monday evening.

The incident came just over a year on from the death of Tameka's stepson Kile following a jet ski crash.

The accident happened when the youngster was said to playing in the swimming pool with Usher's aunt Oden, according to TMZ.

After spying a toy in the drain of the pool, he reportedly dove down to retrieve it but his arm got caught in the process.

Seeing Usher Raymond V underwater, Rena immediately swam down to rescue the boy but to no avail.

A maid also tried but failed to help 
before two men working in the house were said to have rushed out and 
dove into the pool, finally freeing the boy's arm from the drain.

Usher Raymond V was then reportedly given CPR and rushed to hospital.

His
famous father was not home at the time of the incident, but as soon as 
he was notified, was said to have promptly rushed to his Atlanta 
property.

He rode in the ambulance with his son and was later joined at the hospital by Tameka, TMZ reports.

The little boy's state is currently described as 'okay' and doctors are reportedly running tests on him.

Meanwhile, the frantic 911 call which Usher's aunt placed to emergency services has now been released and obtained by TMZ.

During the call, Rena can be heard hysterically begging the operator for an ambulance.

'My
nephew was in the pool. He went and I couldn't get him. I tried to get 
him. They did CPR on him,' she is heard saying in the audio.

She is also heard trying to calm 
Usher's younger brother Naviyd, four, down, all whilst asking the two men
doing CPR on little Usher Raymond V, if he was breathing. 

She then reports to the dispatcher that the youngster is in fact breathing after the CPR.

'Is he OK?' she asks the men. 'He's breathing', she is then heard telling the operator.

Tragic: The incident comes after Usher's stepson Kile Glover,pictured here, tragically passed away at the age of 11 last year following a jet-ski accident

When the ambulance does arrive whilst 
Rena is on the line, little Naviyd is heard saying that his brother is 
'faking it' to which Rena bluntly tells him: 'He is not faking it, come here.'

The terrifying turn of events come 
after Usher's 11-year-old stepson Kile Glover died over a year ago, two 
weeks after he was critically injured in a boating accident.

Kile passed away from the injuries he obtained after being run over on July 6, 2012 by a personal watercraft on Lake Lanier.

The young boy, whose mother is Tameka, was taken off life support by doctors on July 21, who determined that he would not recover from his injuries.

Kile was struck in the head during a jet ski collision while riding an inner tube on the lake in Atlanta, Georgia.

According
to authorities, a family friend who was riding a jet ski behind the 
pontoon lost control and collided with Glover's tube.

Kile
was with an unidentified 15-year-old girl at the time of the accident 
and both children were airlifted to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at 
Egleston.

He was later declared brain dead.

In August last year, Usher was granted primary custody of his two paternal sons, Usher Raymond V and Naviyd, four, both of who he shares with Tameka.

He had been locked in a custody battle with Tameka when Kile passed away.

The
singer had been involved in a bitter dispute with his ex-wife over the 
welfare of the boys, and a judge in Atlanta, Georgia, sided with the 
star.

The children spent the majority of time with their father, while Tameka retained some custodial rights.

Before the case closed, Usher's attorney labelled Tameka ‘incapable of being a proper parent’ to their children.

He had accused Tameka of trying to interfere with the time he was allowed with their kids under their joint custody arrangement - a charge she denied.

During closing arguments in the case, the legal representative said she ‘does not have the emotional stability or capacity to bond with them, and therefore she is handicapped’.

Tameka's attorney, counter argued that Usher travels all the time and does not have a good relationship with his mother, whom he had testified was part of the family unit that would help take care of Usher V and Navyid when he was on the road.
