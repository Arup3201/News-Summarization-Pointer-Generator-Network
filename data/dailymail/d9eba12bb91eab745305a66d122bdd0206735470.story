When Illinois car enthusiast Ron Henderson was told he had terminal cancer, he dedicated his remaining time to restoring his Chevrolet Monte Carlo.

For four months the 67-year-old grandfather worked on getting his 1970 car back on the road but sadly Mr Henderson died just two days before the car was finished.

Friends rallied round however, and added the finishing touches to his prized car before driving it to the funeral home where his visitation was being held.

Mr Henderson was told he had melanoma just over a year ago. Instead of starting a course of chemotherapy, the father-of-two decided to enjoy what remaining time he had left.

His wife, Cathy, told the Effingham Daily News: 'I asked him if he wanted to travel the world. He said "I want to get that Monte going".'

Her husband had commuted to his job at General Electric in the car every day for 20 years.

Friends helped him get it out of storage and begin the long task of making it road worthy again.

'The car needed everything. It was in really bad shape,' his friend, Kevin Pocrnich, said.

He added that Mr Henderson and their group of friends would start working on the car in the morning and keep going till midnight.

'There were a lot of great people that 
got involved in the project,' Mr Pocrnich said, adding that local businesses donated towards the restoration.

Sadly Mr Henderson died two days before the car could be finished and taken out for a test drive. But he did get to sit in it and hear its engine running again.

On the morning of his funeral Mr Pocrnich fulfilled his promise to Mr Henderson, adding the last of the chrome before loading it on to a trailer and taking it to his friend's funeral.

'Ron had a lot of people at his visitation. Everybody loved seeing the car,' he told the Effingham Daily News.

Mr Henderson's widow now plans to sell the car at auction and donate the money raised to cancer research.

'He wanted me to have the car. It is a beautiful car, and I love what these guys have done, but I don't want it without Ron,' Mrs Henderson said.

The family hope to raise $15,000 at auction from the sale, with proceeds going to St Jude's Children's Research Hospital.
