Radamel Falcao's floundering form for Manchester United has not deterred an array of world class clubs from queuing up to sign the striker if Louis van Gaal decides against making his loan move permanent,  Monaco have said.

United have reportedly paid the French side a £6million loan fee as well as Falcao's wages of £265,000 a week. They have the option to sign the Colombia international permanently for £43.2million in the summer.

And despite the striker's underwhelming spell at Old Trafford so far, where he has netted only four goals in 19 games, Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev says Falcao has the attention of other top teams.

'I am not worried for Falcao, he is a world-class striker,' Vasilyev has told the BBC.'If Manchester United decide not to take up the option at the end of the season, we have interest from other great clubs.' 

Falcao was substituted by Van Gaal after an hour as United came from behind to beat Preston North End 3-1 in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Monday. 

It remains to be seen whether he will keep his place in the starting line-up for United's Premier League match against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday.
