It is difficult to imagine a line of washing fluttering in the breeze as an act of provocation.

But for Amanda McGreavy, the sight of the flapping laundry was the final straw in a long-running dispute with her wealthy neighbours.

Furious that her view of the countryside had been ‘deliberately’ blocked, she demanded the washing be taken down.

Amanda McGreavy, who was in a planning dispute with her neighbour, found the countryside view from her window obstructed by Barry Winter's washing line directly opposite

The dispute has cost Mr Winter (left, outside court yesterday), a power station 
manager, from Howden, Hull, £5,200 in legal fees and a 12-month 
community order after he punched and kicked Mrs McGreavy's partner, Roy Walker (right)

When neighbour Barry Winter refused, Mrs McGreavy moved her car to block access to his £450,000 executive home.

Tempers flared, and when Mrs 
McGreavy’s partner Roy Walker arrived, the two men clashed outside their
homes in the quiet cul-de-sac.

Winter, 46, a £100,000-a-year power 
station manager, punched Mr Walker, 53, to the ground before kicking him
in the face and ribs, Hull Crown Court was told. Hearing the commotion,
Mrs McGreavy’s son Christopher, 21, ran outside and was prodded in the 
eye amid the chaos.

Police were called and the washing line row landed Winter with a criminal conviction.

The father of two of Howden, East Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm and assault.

Mr Winter with his wife outside court yesterday. Barrister John Thackray said the father-of-two often worked long hours and was on call to work abroad, making it difficult to complete community punishment

The view from Mrs McGreavy's home which was spoiled by washing

He escaped jail but was ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work and pay £1,200 costs. His total legal bill was at least £5,200.

Passing sentence, Judge Simon Jack 
described the problem between the neighbours as ‘a very unfortunate set 
of circumstances’.

The court heard there had been a long-running 
planning row that had soured relations between the two families.

The 
Winter family’s large detached home was built shortly after Mrs 
McGreavy, 51, a sales rep, moved into her house opposite.

The problems 
began when the mother of two claimed her neighbour built a boundary wall
and gate partially on her land.

Talking to the Mail outside court, Mrs
McGreavy said she became upset by the Winters’ habit of hanging their 
washing in view of their front room, rather than on another less visible
area of their garden.

Amanda McGreavy with her partner Roy Walker, who, along with Mrs McGreavy's 18-year-old son Christopher, was attacked by Mr Winter

At one point her former husband Keith, 54, told 
Winter: ‘You take the washing line down or give us the land back.’

She 
said he relented and removed the washing line.

Peace returned to the 
cul-de-sac until a row over a bonfire on Winter’s property on a summer’s
day three years ago.

Police were called and Mrs McGreavy hired lawyers 
to recover the parcel of land.

The washing line soon returned to its 
former spot and Mrs McGreavy said she was further annoyed by Winter 
leaving three wheelie bins in the same line of view and slamming them at
night.

On their side, the Winters are understood to have complained about damage to their property and set up CCTV as a result.

Mrs McGreavy said she was treated in 
hospital for high blood pressure linked to stress and was put on 
anti-depressants because of her neighbour’s ‘harassment’.

Meanwhile, the
planning problems continued. Winter re-positioned the boundary wall 
because of the disputed patch of land and a planning application to 
increase the height of the wall opposite Mrs McGreavy’s house was turned
down after she objected.

She has now put her £275,000 house on the market. She said: ‘I have suffered harassment 
for the last four years and have had enough.

'It has been a lot of silly 
things, like deliberately hanging washing, including his wife’s 
knickers, on the line to upset me, and setting the alarm off late at 
night and leaving it going.’

Mrs McGreavy said on the day of the 
incident last July she returned home after a drive and ‘snapped’ when 
she saw the washing out.

John Thackray, defending, told the court the offences followed ‘sustained and significant provocation’ from Mrs McGreavy.

Commenting on the attack, which left 
Mr Walker requiring stitches, he said: ‘He (Winter) was pushed to the 
limit. He realises now his actions were in excess of self-defence.’

The judge said he took into account 
Winter’s previous good character in passing a community order. He added:
‘I want to make it clear that a substantial part of the blame lies with
the other neighbour as much as yourself.’

But Mrs McGreavy remained defiant: ‘I 
think the sentence is a joke and he should have gone to prison. Justice 
has not been done.’

Winter declined to comment.
