Boss: Chief executive Moya Greene defended the huge amount of unwanted 'marketing mail' Royal Mail delivers

Although most of it ends up in the bin, postmen should still treat junk mail with ‘utter respect’, the head of the Royal Mail said yesterday.

Announcing a 60 per cent increase in profits to £324million, Moya Greene defended the huge amount of unwanted ‘marketing mail’ it delivers.

She said junk mail had contributed to the state-owned company’s profits, together with an increase in the price of stamps and the delivery of a record number of parcels, mostly as a result of internet shopping.

There is no limit to how much junk mail – formally known as ‘unaddressed mail’ – can be delivered every day.

Yesterday Miss Greene, the Royal Mail chief executive, said the company generated £1.1billion from its marketing mail division last year.

She said: ‘We must treat every single piece of mail with utter respect because we need it. It [marketing mail] is a very important way that businesses rely upon us for growth.’

Over the last year, she said the total amount of junk mail delivered by the company had increased by around 200million items to around 3.3billion.

Miss Greene, who enjoys a total pay package of £1.1million a year, yesterday insisted junk mail is ‘a very important strategy’ for the firm.

As more households go over to ‘paperless’ bills which are sent online, the Royal Mail hopes to deliver larger  quantities of junk mail. Overall, the amount of ‘addressed’ mail has dropped from 63million items a day to 58million a day.

But a spokesman for the Local  
Government Association said: ‘Most  people don’t appreciate being  
bombarded with junk mail on a daily basis.

'Not only is it a nuisance to 
have to pick up and throw away, but it adds thousands of tonnes to the 
amount of waste councils have to collect.’

Royal Mail is being prepared for a controversial flotation on the stock market which is bitterly opposed by the trade unions.

Dave Ward, deputy general secretary of
the Communication Workers Union, said: ‘The positive results are more 
compelling evidence of why Royal Mail should be kept in the public 
sector.’

The union will begin balloting its 
members today about whether or not to refuse to deliver any mail which 
has been initially handled by one of its rivals, such as TNT or UK Mail.

Michael Fallon, the business minister, who has said he would prefer to 
float the company rather than sell it, described the results as ‘another
encouraging step’.

He said: ‘We are committed to a sale but its structure and timing remain open.’

Mr Fallon wants to give at least 10  
per cent of the shares to Royal Mail workers, although it is not clear 
if they will be given away for free or sold at a discounted price.

In April 2012, the cost of a 
first-class stamp jumped from 46p to 60p after the postal regulator 
Ofcom axed the cap which used to control how high stamp prices could be 
increased every year.
