Rant: Dictator Robert Mugabe said his country would never support gay rights

Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe said 'to hell with you' to David Cameron in a speech after the Prime Minister called for global rights.

The 88-year-old tyrant used a speech at his birthday party yesterday to urge Zimbabweans to shun Western values and homosexuality.

His comments came after Mr Cameron last year warned Britain could withdraw aid from developing countries which failed to protect gay rights.

Mugabe, who has ranted about homosexuality for years, has previously branded gays ‘worse than dogs’.

The dictator said his government entirely rejected the suggestion from its former colonial master.

He said: 'We reject that outright and say to hell with you.

'You, David Cameron, are you suggesting that you don’t know that, or is it some kind of insanity or part of the culture of Europeans?'

During his speech, which was broadcast by Zimbabwe’s state-owned television network, Mugabe added that he would never allow gay rights in his country.

He said: 'In their newspapers, that’s one of my sins. That I called (gays) worse than pigs and dogs because pigs know there are males and females.

'I won’t even call him a dog because my own dog will complain.

'It’s even in the Bible that you create through the system of marrying. That’s how we were born, so we reject that outright and say to hell with you.

'You are free as a man to marry a woman and that is what we follow.

'That’s what produced you and me. This kind of insanity is now part of the culture of Europe and the United States.'

Mugabe’s rambling speech came as he addressed a crowd of around 20,000 supporters during a birthday rally in the eastern city of Mutare.

The aging dictator turned 88 last Tuesday and celebrated yesterday with a lavish party.

Local
 media reported that a massive birthday cake was baked for the event in 
Harare and driven the 160 miles to Mutare under a police escort.

Members of Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF who attended the celebration were also treated to musical performances from local bands.

Meanwhile several cattle were slaughtered to provide food for the event, which was reportedly funded by businesses loyal to the ruling party.

The scale of Mugabe’s birthday celebrations have sparked outrage in Zimbabwe, where millions live in poverty following years of disastrous economic mismanagement.

However the president appeared typically unrepentant as he gave his speech, during which he also called for fresh elections to end a power-sharing government with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.

His comments about homosexuality came after Mr Cameron told a conference of Commonwealth leaders in October that Britain could cut aid to developing nations which failed to protect human rights, including gay rights.

Homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe and two members of the same sex caught kissing or even holding hands can face a jail sentence.

Mugabe, a devout Catholic, has repeatedly said he believed same-sex relationships were morally wrong and has criticised MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai for backing gay rights.
