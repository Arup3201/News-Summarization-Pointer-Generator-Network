The bizarre running of Blackpool plunged to new depths on Tuesday night as Burton Albion manager Gary Rowett rejected the club’s advances - despite there being no official vacancy.

Chairman Karl Oyston is primed to sack Jose Riga after just three months in charge and had identified Owen Coyle as the perfect successor.

The former Wigan boss turned down the opportunity after disagreements over a five-figure agent fee, meaning the Seasiders turned to Rowett.

Staying put: Burton boss Gary Rowett has rejected the chance to speak to Blackpool

Snub: Burton confirmed Blackpool's unsuccessful approach via their official Twitter account

The Burton manager is highly regarded in the game for his exuberant brand of football and has impressed on a tight budget - something that would appeal to Oyston.

Riga had looked like being sacked over the weekend but took training on Monday and Tuesday before talks with Oyston.

The club are ready to dispense with his services as soon as they manage to find a man willing to work for the club. Rowett wasn't prepared to do so, with Burton confirming the news on their Twitter account.

'Following discussions with Blackpool, I have decided that I will remain at Burton Albion for the foreseeable future,' he told the club's website. 'I feel as though it is not the right job for me at the present time.

'We’ve made an excellent start to this season, winning seven out of eight games and I feel we have an excellent group of players in the squad currently. I enjoy working with them immensely and this is a very exciting time to be involved at Burton Albion.'  

Heading for the exit: Jose Riga's turbulent Bloomfield Road tenure is set to be ended

Blackpool heralded a new era at Bloomfield Road as Riga jetted in, labelling it the ‘Riga Revolution’. 

That, however, hasn’t been allowed to happen after sustained bickering and fallouts between the Belgian and Oyston.

The pair never saw eye-to-eye from day one, Riga crying broken promises and Oyston questioning his manager’s motives at every turn.

It meant Blackpool - who were in the top half of the Premier League this time four years ago - lost their opening six competitive fixtures of the season and barely have a squad to show for a summer of laughable recruitment.

Riga was forced to train with fewer than 11 players for the majority of pre-season and failed to land most of his top targets. Oyston didn’t agree with some of the fees banded about for foreign imports. 

Man at the top: Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston is poised to wield the axe

The situation has since escalated - Oyston using his column in the town’s local newspaper to attack his own manager - and it appeared Riga would be sacked over the weekend.

The chairman said he was left ‘bemused’ at the Belgian’s decision to take a week’s holiday back home over the international break, claiming he didn’t inform anybody at the club.

Oyston had in fact set the wheels in motion for Riga’s sacking weeks ago but now faces trying to find a new man quickly or promote from within - former England Under 19s coach Noel Blake being the likely beneficiary.
