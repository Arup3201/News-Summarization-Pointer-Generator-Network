A British journalist who filmed a Greenpeace protest on a Russian oil platform could face up to 15 years in prison after being charged with piracy.

Freelance video producer Kieron Bryan was arrested along with 28 activists and another journalist, including six Britons, following a protest last month against Russia’s oil drilling in the Arctic.

Yesterday, his father said that he was ‘shocked’ by the actions of the Russians and ‘disappointed’ that the UK Government had not done more to help the Brits.

Facing time: Freelance videographer Kieron Bryan, 29, from Devon, has been charged with piracy by Russian state prosecutors, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years

The Russian Coast Guard seized the 
Greenpeace ship and the 30 people on board after activists attempted to 
scale an oil rig owned by Russian state-controlled energy giant Gazprom.

But
 Greenpeace condemned the charges as ‘extreme and disproportionate’ and 
said the Russian actions were an ‘assault’ on the idea of a peaceful 
protest.

Mr Bryan, 29, is 
one of three members of the crew with links to Devon currently being 
held in Russia following the protest on September 18.

Kieron's
 father Andy Bryan, from Shebbear in Devon, said: ‘We are quite shocked 
at the actions the Russians have taken against what is a peaceful 
organisation.

Under siege: Russian coast guards board the Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise, following a protest by  activists at a Russian oil platform in the Pechora Sea, off the coast of Russia.

‘We were hoping the situation would be higher profile, given there are six Brits in the group.’

Mr
 Bryan said he was not aware of any statement or information being 
issued by the government, which he said he was ‘surprised and 
disappointed’ about.

The 
Foreign Office said that they were providing consular assistance. Alex 
Harris, 27, who was brought up in Devon, and engineer Iain Rogers, 37, 
from Exeter, are also being held.

Greenpeace
 said the charges were the biggest threat to its work since its ship 
Rainbow Warrior was bombed in New Zealand in 1985 during its protest 
against French nuclear testing in the Pacific.

It
 said that last month’s protest was peaceful and posed no threat, and 
that piracy charges have no merit in international or Russian law.

It
 added that activists from Brazil, Britain, Finland and Sweden have been
 charged with piracy and said that more activists are expected to be 
formally charged today.

Russian
 President Vladimir Putin said last week that the protesters were 
clearly not pirates but that they had violated international law.

The
 investigators said the Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise, had 
violated the 500-metre (550-yard) security zone around the platform and 
that it was carrying equipment for an unknown purpose.

Greenpeace
 said that its ship stayed out of this zone but its inflatable boats 
used by activists to reach the platform and then scale it posed no 
danger.

Fourteen Greenpeace activists, including at least four from the UK, have now been charged with piracy.

The
 Arctic rig is due to begin operation by the end of the year and will 
likely produce six million tonnes of oil per year by 2019.

But
 Greenpeace says scientific evidence shows any oil spill from the rig 
would affect more than 3,000 miles of Russia's northern coastline.

Russian judge Dmitry Krivonosov handed 10 Greenpeace activists two month jail sentences for their protest in Russian waters last week.

Last
 night, Mr Bryan’s family told the Mail: ‘Kieron is a freelance 
journalist who was employed by Greenpeace on a short term contract to 
make films for both media and promotional distribution during the trip 
to the Arctic. He is a journalist not an activist.

‘He is passionate about his work and is particularly interested in political and environmental issues.

‘We
 are stunned and shocked at the charges the Russian authorities have 
produced against him and urge the UK and Russian Governments to do 
everything possible to secure his release as soon as possible.

‘Kieron
 is a very kind and caring person. His family, in particular his 
parents, are extremely worried about him and we just want him home.’

Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said: ‘It is an extreme and disproportionate charge.

Water cannons were used to try and stop Greenpeace activists climbing onto the oil platform

‘A
 charge of piracy is being laid against men and women whose only crime 
is to be possessed of a conscience. This is an outrage and represents 
nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest.

‘Any
 claim that these activists are pirates is as absurd as it is 
abominable. It is utterly irrational, it is designed to intimidate and 
silence us, but we will not be cowed.’

He
 added that Russia's treatment of the protesters was ‘the most serious 
threat to Greenpeace's peaceful environmental activism’ since its ship 
Rainbow Warrior was bombed in New Zealand in 1985, when the group was 
protesting French nuclear testing in the Pacific.

The activists have been in custody in the northern city of Murmansk since last week.

A
 Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘We are providing 
consular assistance to all six British nationals arrested in connection 
to the protest by Greenpeace.

‘Consular
 officials have travelled to Murmansk, raised the issue with Russian 
authorities and are providing support to the British nationals and 
liaising with Greenpeace.’
