Get the look: Daisy Lowe, the model face of Rodial's first make-up range, shared her  beauty and style tips with FEMAIL

As the face of the capsule range, which is designed to sculpt and define the cheeks and features for a natural, flawless and radiant look, Daisy obviously loves using the products.

'It's a fail-safe range,' says Daisy. 'You just have to learn where to place the contouring. My top tip is: suck in your cheeks and make a fish face, which casts a natural shadow on your face. 

'Then apply the bronzer over that shadow and then pop the highlighter above that.'

Sharing her signature Christmas beauty look, she said: 'My Christmas Party essentials for luminous skin are the Contour Powder to add definition and Illuminating Powder for a glow because, for me, Christmas  is all about gleaming skin. 

'For party eyes, my go-to favourites are Eye Sculpt and Smokey Eye Pen in black, which I smudge for a smoky eye effect finished with lashings of Skinny Mascara.'

After years on the modelling circuit, Daisy says the top tip she's picked up is using concealer around her nose to even the skin tone.

'And make your forehead and chin a lighter shade than the rest of your face for a more defined look,' she said. 

The dewy-skinned model says she swears by lymphatic drainage and blue light treatments to keep her skin clear and has a Michael Kors bag, a set of travel speakers and Tom Ford fragrance on her Christmas wish list.

The model - who is the daughter of Pearl Lowe and Gavin Rossdale - says she takes beauty inspiration from supermodel Erin O’ Connor and style cues from Mariah Carey.

Daisy, who describes her personal style as 'Parisian chic with a naughty London twist', says she loves toughening up a grown-up dress with grungy Dr. Martens to 'stay true to her Camden roots'. 

Inspired by the Thirties and Seventies, she loves creations by Christopher Kane, Erdem and Saint Laurent and says online shopping at Topshop and Reformation is 'lethal'.

No wonder Daisy has such good taste- she has best pal and fashion's darling Alexa Chung to share style secrets with.

While Alexa, who is known for her famous feline eye flick and recently unveiled her own eye make-up range,  is 'amazing' at doing make-up, said Daisy.

Daisy may have just been signed up by Rodial, but she's also been very busy with other projects.

Recently, the in-demand brunette was unveiled as the new face of U.S. clothing brand American Eagle Outfitters.

And, as well as her modelling duties, earlier this year the baking enthusiast released a recipe book entitled Sweetness And Light, a collection of recipes for 60 healthy treats.

By making simple changes to ingredients, such as using maple syrup rather than refined sugar, or discovering new ingredients like raw chocolate, Daisy promises that her recipes are transformed into something 'devilishly delicious' but 'angelically healthy'.

'I just love cooking,' she told us. 'In the future I want to do more cooking, shooting campaigns and see the world.

'In five years time I want to continue doing loads of fashion stuff and be happy with a big smile on my face.'

Speaking about her festive food habits, she said: 'I let myself off a little bit at Christmas, eating is the main event of the day after all and my New Year's resolution is live in the moment.'

With such a positive attitude to life, it's no wonder the founder of Rodial, Maria Hatzistefanis, snapped her up.

She said: ‘I first met Daisy when she attended our Rodial awards where she won Woman of the Year. I was impressed by her effortless natural beauty, style and radiance. 

'What Daisy can bring to the Rodial brand is a modern, cool and quintessentially British edge.’

From the £52-illuminating powder to the eye sculpt,£34, each of the new products have been designed to contour and sculpt your face.

The powders are opalescent, so designed to highlight facial features with an illuminating gleam, and the universal champagne tone aims to add a candle-lit glow to the skin.

The powders use micronisation technology  in the formula, which is intended to give the skin a silky texture and ensures even application.

The eye products have been made with a mousse-like texture, which, say the makers, can be built up from subtle natural enhancement to a deeper, more sculpted effect so  looks can go from day to night.

There's also a tinted cream, £24, that adds a flush of colour to the cheeks to give a long-wearing healthy glow. The moisture-boosting hyaluronic acid promises to plump skin while the coral shade adds a subtle rosy colour to the apple of the cheeks.

If you want to try before you buy, Harvey Nichols has opened a sculpting bar, where beauty fans can test out the products.
