White supremacist Thomas Joseph Murphy and convicted killer Carmen Montelongo have both been sentenced to life, in more ways than one.

Murphy, 46, from Crestline, California, was handed down a 248-year-to-life sentence last week in connection to a 2009 kidnapping, assault and battery case involving three women, dissuading a witness and animal cruelty. .

Last Thursday, Murphy's attorney filed a motion asking a judge for a new trial because his client had been denied the right to represent himself.

They found love in a hopeless place: Convicted kidnapper Thomas Murphy, 46 (left), proposed marriage to convicted murderer Carmen Montelongo (right), 54, whom he met aboard a jail bus 

During the hearing, it was revealed that the 46-year-old self-proclaimed Neo-Nazi was engaged to Carmen Montelongo, 54, who was sentenced that same week to 26 years to life in the stabbing death and dismemberment of her boyfriend.

Prosecutor Denise Yoakum suggested that the two jailbirds, who had never met before, likely fell in love on bus rides to and from court, The Alpenhorn News reported. .

According to Murphy’s court records, in June 2009 he arrived at a home in Crestline looking for his estranged girlfriend.

Believing that the people living in house were hiding the woman from him, Murphy forced his way inside and took the inhabitants hostage.

The suspect then poured gasoline over his captives and threatened to set them alight.

During the incident that lasted several hours, one of the female victims tried to escape ut was caught and beaten by Murphy with a hammer.

Eventually one of the captives was able to get away and call for help, but by the time sheriff's deputies arrived Murphy had escaped.

The kidnapper, who has Adolf Hitler's face and a swastika tattooed on his neck, was arrested the following day in Fullerton following a high-speed chase that involved several car collisions. 

During his trial, Murphy asked an attorney to take out an ad in a local newspaper that would name the victims in the 2009 attack in a bid to dissuade them from testifying against him, according to testimony.

In court last week, Murphy apologized to his victims but also sounded a defiant note.

‘I’m heading to prison for the rest of my life and I’ll battle because I can’t be broken,’ he stated, according to Los Angeles Daily News

Murphy's violent behavior dates back to at least 1996, when he was charged with assault for hitting his then-girlfriend in the head with a telephone receiver until it split in half.

While he was being held in jail in connection to the phone attack, Murphy allegedly hired a fellow inmate to kill his girlfriend and her young son, but the assassination plan never came to fruition.

Murphy eventually pleaded guilty to charges of assault with a deadly weapon in exchange for having the murder solicitation charge dropped, and he was sentenced to eight years in prison.

Thomas Murphy's bride-to-be has an equally dark past.

Carmen Montelongo, of Riverside, was found guilty in late August of first-degree murder in connection to the grisly 2011 slaying of 62-year-old Samuel Wiggins.

Ms Montelongo, who also goes by the alias Montenegro, was arrested in late May 2011 after she was spotted wheeling a barrel in San Bernadino, California, reeking of decomposing flesh.

Police officers who became suspicious of the malodorous container looked inside and found a man's torso and two legs mingled with soil.

The rest of the victim’s remains, including the head, were discovered hidden inside two flower pots at a home in the Los Angeles suburb of Bell Gardens, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Mr Wiggins was reported missing by his relatives in early May 2011 - about a month after he was last seen alive.

According to the prosecutors, Montelongo killed him a short time later by stabbing her boyfriend twice in the chest and 22 times in the back. 

There is no word at this time when the two convicted felons will wed.
