It is 14 years to the day since Lionel Messi joined Barcelona - a moment in time to spark one of the greatest footballing combinations ever seen. 

The Argentine's wizardry has been reserved solely for the Catalans, who owe much of their recent success to the 27-year-old. 

To celebrate the anniversary, both Messi and the club posted separate reminders of his registration from all those years ago.

Messi said on Facebook: 'On 17th of September 2000, I arrived at FC Barcelona. Today it's my 14th anniversary at the club.

'I'd like to say thanks to all my teammates, managers, fans, board directors and the staff I've had the pleasure of working with and the amazing support they have always given me. Hugs!' 

Messi's time at the Nou Camp has been nothing short of phenomenal to date.

The Argentine has clinched no fewer than six La Liga titles as well as three Champions League winners' medals.  

Since breaking through into the first team in 2004 Messi has been at the heartbeat of the club and embodies their football philosophy. Only Cristiano Ronaldo rivals the forward for genuine excitement on the ball in the world.  

Now 27, Messi is still happy with life at Barcelona and has won a bucket load of trophies
