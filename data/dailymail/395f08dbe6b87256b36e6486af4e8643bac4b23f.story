Fernando Torres admitted being blown away by the welcome he received from Liverpool fans on an emotional return to Anfield on Sunday.

The Spain international returned to his former club to take part in a charity match played between teams picked by Reds icons Steven Gerrard and Sportsmail's own Jamie Carragher. Torres and Luis Suarez both received a standing ovation when they made their second-half introduction.

Torres admits being surprised by the response, especially after supporters had acted angrily when he left the club for Chelsea for a then British record £50million in 2011.
