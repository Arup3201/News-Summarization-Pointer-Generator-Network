Sky Sports News will relaunch their channel on August 12 under the name Sky Sports News HQ.

It is the fifth time it has undergone an overhaul in the 16 years that the 24/7 news service has run. The original show, started in October 1998, featured a wooden bench – and it has since come along way.

Given the nature of live television, there have been a number of infamous incidents over the years.

Nick Collins took a tumble outside Wembley from what appeared to be a small off-camera ladder while reporting on an injury to Michael Carrick last year.

There was the glorious moment in 2010 when Jeff Stelling, in full flow on Soccer Saturday, goes over to Chris Kamara live at Fratton Park for Portsmouth versus Blackburn where there has just been a red card.

‘I don’t know Jeff, has there?’ Kamara says in a panic. ‘I must’ve missed that. Red card?’ He continues to look backwards and forward from the pitch to the camera in disbelief.

And there was the time Bryan Swanson has a slip-of-the-tongue when explaining Roque Santa Cruz’s loan move from Manchester City to Blackburn in 2011. ‘Santa Cruz now going from a Manchester sh***y shirt into a Blackburn shirt,’ he says, without a hint of a smile.

Having a laugh: Chris Kamara's gaffes on Sky Sports News have made him into a cult hero among fans

Previous presenters over the years have included Georgie Thompson and Ed Chamberlain while household names Kirsty Gallacher and Jim White still present today.

Their 200 staff, 32 reporters and 20 presenters will move into a new studio, for the second time in three years, twice the size of their old one which includes an 18 square-metre video wall.

The introduction of Sky Sports News HQ will mean they are completely revamping their apps and website and will have a social media desk on site.

Deadline duo: Sky Sports News presenters Jim White and Natalie Sawyer

Sky Sports managing director Barney Francis said: ‘The launch of Sky Sports News HQ will extend and enhance the experience across TV, mobile and online.’

Sky Sports News HQ executive editor Andy Cairns added: ‘Sky Sports News has always been authoritative, innovative, fun and relevant. These changes reflect how we’re staying ahead of the curve and anticipating the needs of our viewers.

'Sports fans want to get even further into the heart of sports news, and we’ll take them there with the best resources.’

The channel will move to 401 on Sky, shifting their other Sky Sports channels up a number each, making it their foremost channel.
