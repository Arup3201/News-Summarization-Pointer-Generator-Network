Rescuers searching a Himalayan river for dozens of Indian students, who were swept away when a dam released a rush of water, have retrieved four bodies.

The 25 students from the southern city of Hyderabad had been taking photographs on the banks of the Beas River on Sunday when they were engulfed by the water from the Larji hydropower station near the mountain resort town of Manali in Himachal Pradesh.

They had been on a 10-day field trip with around 48 students, some of whom managed to scramble to safety.

'We saw a wall of water hit those who were on the banks. They fell flat and disappeared under the waves,' a student identified only as Sumiran told The Indian Express newspaper.

Kiran Kumar, a professor who was accompanying the students, said he saw the water level rising and told the students to step back from the bank.

But 'within one or two seconds, the water level increased all of a sudden. Some of the students were washed away right in front of me,' he told the the Associated Press.

Police in Manali said four bodies were recovered Monday morning after the search resumed at dawn. They said a shortage of boats and divers was hampering the operation.

'Officials there are fearing the chances of finding survivors were slim,' said Anurag Sharma, police director general in Telangana state, where Hyderabad is located.

Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh demanded the dam's engineer be suspended while the incident is investigated.

Telangana's government on Monday sent police officials and parents of the missing to the search site, 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of New Delhi.

Anxious friends and relatives gathered at Hyderabad's Vigyan Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology waiting for news of the missing.

Victim: A body of one of the students is taken from a building in Kullu, where the search operation is continuing

Transport: Rescuers have been out in rafts and boats for most of the day in a desperate bid to find the youngsters
