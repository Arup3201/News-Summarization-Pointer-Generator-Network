A have-a-go-hero was so badly beaten and covered in blood after he challenged a car thief that his family thought he had been shot.

Danny Mason, 37, was repeatedly punched in the face and left with a fractured cheek, broken nose and cut lip after he approached the would-be-thief in Blackburn, Lancashire. 

He had just left a family party at around 11.45pm on Saturday when he tried to stop the would-be-thief from stealing a number of cars.

The 37-year-old, who now lives in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, was found slumped unconscious on the ground by family members and is now in so much pain that he cannot sleep or work.

Danny Mason, 37, was repeatedly punched in the face and left with a fractured cheek, broken nose and cut lip after challenging a car thief 

He said: 'It all happened so quickly that I did not have a chance to think about it.

'Looking back, I thought I was doing the right thing by speaking to this man, but now I am in so much pain that I cannot sleep or work.'

He was taken by ambulance to Royal Preston Hospital before being transferred to the facial injury unit at Royal Bolton Hospital.

Police have now released CCTV images of a white man around 6ft tall who they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

Mr Mason's sister Sue Bannister said that the family have been 'deeply shocked and upset' by the attack and asked anyone with information to come forward. 

She said: 'We had come to Blackburn for a family party and were having a really good time until the incident happened.

'Danny had gone outside for a cigarette when he spotted a man who looked like he was trying to break into vehicles.

'He spoke to him and asked him what he was doing and the man just started attacking him. 

'A neighbour spotted what was happening and the man took off. He said that he had been punching him over and over.

Police described the attacker as white, between 6ft and 6ft 2in tall, of an average to medium build with short light brown or dark blonde hair

'Our cousin came outside to see where Danny was as he had been a long time and saw him slumped unconscious on the ground.

'He has been in a lot of pain and the whole family have been left deeply shocked and upset by the incident.

'We really want anyone who has any information to come forward in order to try and catch whoever is responsible.'

Councillor Jackie Slater, who represents the Fernhurst ward, described the attacker as an 'evil thug' and said she was appalled by the assault. 

'My thoughts are with Mr Mason and his family. It was such a brave thing for him to do and he has to be applauded in a lot of ways.

'It is just unfortunate that in today's society, it is not a wise thing to do.

'I hope the police catch whoever did this quickly.'
