A psychic bus driver has been sacked after refusing to pick
up schoolchildren because he had a premonition 'that something bad 
would happen'.

The clairvoyant driver, who has not been named, left the children standing at the side of the road in Dundee.

But the driver failed to see what was coming for his career
prospects when he was hauled in front of bosses at National Express.

Premonition: The National Express driver left children by the road because he feared 'something bad would happen' to them. He was sacked afterwards

Despite his excuse he was promptly dismissed, a move praised by Dundee Council’s education chief  Stewart Hunter.

He said: 'It’s good National Express has taken action. I can’t comment on what’s happened to the driver, but it’s 
important for kids to be able to get to school on time. If the bus 
doesn’t stop then that’s something that worries me.'

But a spiritual medium has defended the man, who is to appeal the decision, claiming it was 'entirely possible he experienced a premonition'.

Ewan Irvine, who works at the Arthur Conan Doyle Centre in 
Edinburgh, said: 'Although I don’t know much about the case 
itself, it is entirely possible that the man had a psychic sense 
something bad was going to happen.

'Speaking from personal experience, I know that when I get 
that weird, edgy feeling, I normally listen to it because it means 
something is going to happen, whether it be good or bad.

'Rather be safe than sorry.'

A spokesman for National Express Dundee which employs 360 workers and has 130 coaches, said: 'We won't discuss conversations with individual members of staff.'
