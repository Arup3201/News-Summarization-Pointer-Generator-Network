An Australia Day rap parody of Iggy Azalea's hit song Fancy has been uploaded to YouTube, but don’t expect the tourist board to be using it to promote the country.

Called I'm So Aussie! the rapper known only as Robbo packs plenty of references into the song from Vegemite to ciggies to Alf Stewart from Home and Away.

Starting with the line 'first things first I'm fair dinkum', pretty much gives you a good idea of what else is to come over the next two minutes.

I'm So Aussie! is rapper Robbo's tribute to Australia Day and being Australian 

The rapper takes a light-hearted look at the joys of living in Australia today  

Robbo's tune is a rap parody of Iggy Azalea's hit song Fancy

Apart from the tourist board international superstar Azalea may not be too happy at what Robbo has done to the chorus of her song either.

It now goes: 'I'm so Aussie, You already know. I'm in the only lane from Tamworth to Bendigo. I'm so Aussie. Drinking XXXX Gold. Remember my name... it's Robbo!'

Robbo goes on to rap about how he likes to 'chuck a sickie', spends his time 'doing bugger all' and describes himself as a 'lower class bogan'. His chances of the song being used in a national tourism advertisement will probably have gone at this stage.

However, Robbo's only getting started as he gives a shout out to Tim Tams, scallops, fish n' chips, and meat pies, telling everyone 'you should taste that', while also claiming to have a 'moustache on my face like David Boon'. 

His YouTube video definitely is a light-hearted look at Australia and follows Coach Bombay's song and video package on YouTube earlier this month called ‘Straya!’ which is a cover of Outkast’s number one 2003 hit ‘Hey Ya!’ with appropriate Australian images and lyrics. 

Both videos were aimed at Australia Day celebrations and only time will tell which one proves to be the most popular in the long run.

Robbo's version may just get him in more trouble.

Although a good laugh, Iggy Azalea may not be laughing after she hears what's been done to her song
