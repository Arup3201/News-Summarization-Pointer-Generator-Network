Floyd Mayweather was among the stars at the LA Clippers game on Monday night as the undefeated champion brought in his 38th birthday courtside.

Actor Rob Lowe posted a picture with Mayweather from the Staples Centre with the caption: 'It's on! With The Champ at the Clipper game tonight.'

And Mayweather may have had more reason to celebrate having finally agreed on a date to fight long-term rival Manny Pacquiao, May 2.

The five-division world champion is set to pocked a minimum £96m from the £160m mega fight, and while he has been pictured since eating hot dogs at NBA games, Pacquiao has already proven he is getting down to work.

The 36-year-old looked extremely focused during a training session in the Philippines on Monday, as he worked out at a gym in General Santos City.

The Clippers eventually lost to the Memphis Grizzlies 90-87, while Mayweather's girlfriend also took a picture of the boxer on his birthday, writing: 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!! #TBE (The Best Ever)'.

Meanwhile, trainer Floyd Mayweather Sr has already said he doesn't see Manny Pacquiao   as having a chance in the fight, because he is too short.

Additionally, he notes that Pacquiao hasn't knocked out anybody in the last five years.

'The man [Pacquiao] ain't knocked nobody out in five years. He ain't knocked nobody out in 5 years, and the same guy that knocked his [backside] ice cold, Floyd beat him 12 rounds easy,' Floyd Sr told Fighthype.com. 

'If he was struggling with Marquez then, that boy ain't got a chance in hell. I'm just telling you the truth, man. He's so damn short. Floyd's going to make him look like a baby.'

American cable networks Showtime and HBO are preparing to charge a record $99.95 (£65) for a pay-per-view subscription to watch the richest fight in history.

A bidding war is under way for TV rights in at least 200 countries outside the US, the UK included with Sky, BT, BoxNation and perhaps ITV in contention for the bout. Sky Sports open as favourites.
