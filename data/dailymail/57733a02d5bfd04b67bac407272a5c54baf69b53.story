Travellers have moved onto a seafront next to a yacht club, marina and gym - with more than a dozen caravans arriving at a public space.

Brighton and Hove City Council officials and police have visited the site at the Black Rock car park, with the vehicles thought to have moved onto the area last Wednesday.

The group have been told they are trespassing on council-owned land - and have been asked to leave, with an application for a possession order expected to be made to the county court.

The council said it hopes to evict the travellers ‘as soon as practicable, should the families fail to leave the site voluntarily’, according to local newspaper The Argus.

A council spokesman did not return a comment request today, but a statement issued on Friday said: ‘Council officers have visited this site with the police, and the statutory checks have been carried out.

‘The travellers have been informed that they are trespassing on council-owned land and have been asked to leave.

‘We have instructed our legal team to apply to the county court for a possession order to regain possession of the land.

‘This will enable us to arrange for an eviction to be carried out as soon as practicable, should the families fail to leave the site voluntarily.’

Problem for officials: The council faced a bill of £194,147 last year for dealing with the issue of illegal travellers

Costly: Figures show that town halls were left with a total bill of £1.2million last year for dealing with travellers

A Sussex Police spokesman said he was not able to answer media requests on the subject today.

Local Conservative MP Simon Kirby has launched a petition calling for the council ‘to use the powers available to them to deal promptly with unauthorised traveller encampments in the city’.

Illegal travellers present a major problem for the council, with it facing a bill of £194,147 last year for dealing with the issue - only surpassed by Leeds City Council, which spent £211,153.

Town halls were left with a total bill of £1.2million last year for dealing with travellers who illegally pitch their caravans on council-owned land.

The bill included clearing up hazardous waste dumped by the travellers, providing security guards around their illegal camps and even putting in portable toilets for them.

In total, the bill - which is met through council tax payments - came to around £400,000 each for legal costs, the clean-up and the expenses to secure the site after the travellers had been evicted.
