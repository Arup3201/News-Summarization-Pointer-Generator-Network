The mother from the Gold Coast has lost a total of 29 kilograms through personal training and exercise, but it is her relaxed 7-step guide to success that she credits to keeping the weight off.

The flexible guide allows you to eat five to six meals a day and indulge in anything you crave in moderation.

'Use it however it works for you,' Lindy told Daily Mail Australia.

'If five to six similar sized meals a day doesn't work, have three square meals and two snacks... Just keep everything regular, everyday. 

She unknowingly walked into a body building gym on her first day of training and burst into tears thinking she would never be able to resemble one of these fitness models

Lindy is following a seven step guide, which she says 'is perfect as I'm still breast feeding and I need to be careful when dieting'

The steps include adding protein to every meal, eating five servings of fruit and vegetables, sticking to a meal plan, avoiding sugar, drinking water and staying active.

It aims to work around every individual's different schedule with the expectation of that being the only way people will participate.

'There is nothing on the seven rules that you cannot eat,' she said.

'I eat chocolate at least twice a day because I've built up my metabolism so that I can do that.'

Lindy works her program by listening to her own body, admitting that she hates to run.

'I've never run and I never will - it doesn't work for me.' 

Lindy changed her eating habits after losing 29 kilograms at the hands of her personal trainer.
