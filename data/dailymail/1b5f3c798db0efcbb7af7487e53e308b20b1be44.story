Whether she's claiming that water has feelings or sharing her favourite healthy recipes, Gwyneth Paltrow uses her weekly Goop blog to share her innermost thoughts and feelings.

This week the A-lister, who celebrated her 42nd birthday last week, has gone all New-Agey on us and called in a psychic to answer her most burning spiritual questions.

'Weird as it may sound considering our New Age leanings, not one of us freaks over at goop HQ had ever had a psychic reading,' writes Gwyneth.

Calling in help: Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, has gone all new-agey on us by calling in a psychic to answer her and her friends' questions in this week's Goop instalment

'But since we're on an unquenchable quest to experience every type of modality to help us heal, expand, and deepen our understanding of all life's mysteries, when we heard tell of an exceptionally gifted L.A.-based intuitive, Jill Willard, we had to talk to her - and talk to her some more.'

Gwyneth goes on to explain that Willard, who does not refer to herself as a psychic thanks to 'woo woo' and negative connotations, sees things. And, she says, as a medium, Willard also sees dead people. 

'But the experience isn't at all what you would expect,' adds Gwyneth. 'Willard thinks of herself as more of a guide or aid, whose function is to help people do this for themselves, by tapping into their own intuition, a state she believes we can all achieve'.

So fascinated by this is Gwyneth, that she asked Willard to share her views on life after death and how people can unlock this ability themselves.

'We all have a knowing,' Willard tells the actress. 'It's really just a question of whether we're willing to acknowledge and honor what we know, and act on it in a positive way. 

'Often, we let our fears get in the way, or we shut it down because we don't want to believe there is another way, and we don't want to listen. 

'I have been there, too, trust me. I have completely ignored what I knew to be true because I didn't like the truth - it wasn't what I wanted.'

New York, NY - Gwyneth Paltrow was seen out and about to watch her mother's Blythe Danner Broadway play 'The Country House' after celebrating her 42nd birthday last week 

Other questions that the mother-of-two asks Willard include: 'Is there destiny?' and 'Are the sixth and seventh chakras essentially the same thing?', which she replies to with in-depth answers. 

The new post comes as Gwyneth's estranged husband, Chris Martin, apparently threw a birthday party for her last week.

Nicole Richie, Kate Hudson and Matt Bellamy were among the other stars in attendance.

Chris is currently dating Jennifer Lawrence, and it is claimed Gwyneth has met her - and approves.

A source told UK's LOOK magazine: 'Chris, Gwyneth and Jennifer were all in LA earlier this month, so Gwyneth suggested a friendly lunch between her and Jennifer. They met at her Brentwood home and drank tea and ate homemade scones while chatting in the garden.'

'Gwyn broke the ice by telling Jen she's happy Chris wound up with such a smart, beautiful woman.'
