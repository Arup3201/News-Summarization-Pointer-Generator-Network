President Christian Wulff is though to be about to leave his office amid an escalating scandal

He is alleged to have accepted free holidays from wealthy friends, upgrades on airlines and discounted cars

Germany's president resigned in disgrace yesterday after failing to gag newspapers investigating him over political favours.

The resignation of Christian Wulff – a victory for Press freedom – is an embarrassing blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had hand-picked her political ally as president.

In a curt statement at the presidential palace in Berlin, Mr Wulff said he had lost the trust of the German people, making it impossible to continue in a role meant to serve as a moral compass for the nation.

He was forced to resign after trying to stop German newspapers investigating a home loan scandal involving more than £430,000 received from a businessman friend’s wife – allegations taken up by prosecutors.

Mr Wulff, 52, whose role was mainly ceremonial, admitted making a ‘grave mistake’ by leaving a message on the answering machine of the editor of Germany’s best-selling Bild newspaper threatening ‘war’ if the daily published a story about his private finance dealings.

He was later criticised for accepting free upgrades on holiday flights for himself and his family as well as staying free of charge at the villas of wealthy businessmen.

The media continued to delve into his dealings and on Thursday state prosecutors in Hanover – his former power base as governor of Lower Saxony – asked parliament to end Mr Wulff’s legal immunity over accusations he accepted favours.

The move was a prelude to opening an investigation into him. It is the first time prosecutors have sought to investigate a German president and the decision triggered opposition calls for him to go.

Mrs Merkel, who postponed a trip to Rome yesterday, said she regretted Mr Wulff’s departure.

He is the second president to step down in two years. His predecessor, Horst Koehler, resigned unexpectedly in 2010 after coming under fire for comments he made about the German mission in Afghanistan.

Der Spiegel, the prestigious news magazine, had taken up the gauntlet laid down by the popular Bild, saying: ‘All of the revelations come together to form . . . a picture of a character that revolves around three concepts: perks, upgrades and self-abasement. These concepts run counter to what is expected of a politician in a democracy.

‘Wulff . . . doesn’t want to pay the prices a normal citizen would have to pay for his lifestyle, for such expenses as his house, his car and his vacations. Wulff uses his public offices to secure discounts . . . They give him the privilege to accept perks from rich friends or companies – who hope to get something in return.’

Mr Wulff’s resignation reflects badly on Mrs Merkel’s judgment  as she pushed for his election in June 2010 against an opposition candidate backed by most Germans. She said she would talk to the opposition this time to find a consensus candidate.
