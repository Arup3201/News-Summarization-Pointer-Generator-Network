'Only joking': Lewis Hamilton, 24, was jailed for two years yesterday for aggravated burglary

An incompetent armed burglar has been jailed after he was recognised by his old manager halfway through trying to rob the pub where he used to work.

Lewis Hamilton, 24, who had been sacked from his job as a barman at the Trading Room pub in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, then tried to pass his crime off as a joke.

Hamilton stormed into the pub armed with a six-inch knife 13 days after losing his job there. When he came through the door he had his face covered by his jacket and a scarf.

He then demanded money from his former manager, Holly McDonald, but his makeshift disguise slipped and he was immediately recognised.

He then tried to laugh off the incident, and even tried to bribe Ms McDonald with half his takings, but left empty-handed and was apprehended by police.

Hamilton , of Chelmsford, Essex, was sentenced to two years in prison at Basildon Crown Court yesterday after he pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary.

The court heard that after his cover was ruined, Hamilton, still wielding his knife, said: 'Don’t worry - I am only joking.'

He then tried to claim he was simply returning his uniform despite not having it with him. He had been fired 13 days previously when it emerged he had been sacked from a former pub job after he didn't pay off his food tab.

He returned on 27 October 2013 and broke in through a fire exit.

Charlotte Davison, prosecuting, told the court: “Ms McDonald heard someone outside the office and saw the door move.

'She called out: "Are you going to come in, then?" The door flew open and the defendant appeared in front of her.

'She did not recognise him at first as he had the top of his coat covering his face. He was holding a kitchen knife with a six-inch blade and asked her to hand over the money on the desk.'

The makeshift disguise, which included a scarf wrapped around his head, fell down revealing Hamilton’s face as he demanded she hand over money which was being cashed up.

It was then he attempted to laugh off his crime, desperately offering his former boss half of the stolen money, but he left without anything and was arrested later that evening.

Ms Davison concluded saying: 'Ms McDonald said the whole experience felt unreal and she was left in shock.'
