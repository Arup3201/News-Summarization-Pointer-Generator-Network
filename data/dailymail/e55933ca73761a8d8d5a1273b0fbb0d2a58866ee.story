Campaign groups are furious about a 'sexist' cartoon posted on a police Twitter account which shows a man gagging his wife with a seatbelt.

The tweet, which shows a female car passenger gagged and bound to her chair as a male driver looks on smugly, was yesterday uploaded by a police officer.

Above the cartoon a banner read: 'New Seatbelt design: 45% less car accidents!!'

It was also captioned by the officer: 'A car designer has won an award for designing a seatbelt which helps to cut down on vehicle noise pollution #IWantOne.'

The officer who tweeted the 'sexist' cartoon is now being investigated by the force's Professional Standards Department after it was found to have been in breach of the organisation's social media policy

West Midlands Police has now released a full statement apologising for 'any offence caused by this inappropriate use of one of our accounts'.

The officer in question is also being investigated by the force’s Professional Standards Department.

The incident provoked a barrage of complaints on the social networking site, with criticism from people based all over the UK and as far as Johannesburg in South Africa.

Chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, Sandra Horley CBE, criticised the force’s 'derogatory attitudes to women'.

'I am disappointed that West Midlands Police tweeted this sexist image - and then tried to pass it off as a bit of "humour".

'Did the police officer who tweeted this image really think that women would laugh at this offensive sexist stereotype? Female members of the public deserve respect, not ridicule.

'It is deeply disturbing that some police officers in West Midlands seem to possess such derogatory attitudes towards women.'

Shabana Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham’s Ladywood constituency, added: 'The police are responsible for helping to hold to account those who perpetrate domestic violence.

'The fact that they have posted online a so-called joke which minimises the seriousness of this crime is both insulting and worrying.

'If individuals within the police force don’t understand that it is not a laughing matter and ensure that they take domestic violence seriously then who will?'

Online campaign group End Misogyny confirmed the post will be appearing on its weekly updates of online sexist abuse.

A spokesperson said: 'We see high volumes of misogyny and abuse here at End Online Misogyny and very often such comments, many of which promote domestic and sexual violence, are made under the guise of so-called humour.

Bordesley Green police received a furious backlash on Twitter after the officer posted the cartoon - which was in clear breach of the force's social media policy

Inspector Karen Winfield, based at the nearby Stechford police station (pictured), said the cartoon which depicted the passenger in the car being gagged, was 'sexist and offensive' and in breach of police policy

'It is however, extremely worrying to see a police account with nearly 1,000 followers... tweet out such an endorsement of violence against women.'

Inspector Karen Winfield, from Birmingham Police, said: 'An officer working on one of our neighbourhood accounts has tweeted a sexist and offensive picture which clearly breaches the force’s social media policy.

'This was an inappropriate tweet, made by one member of staff, and it in no way reflects the views of the force.

'Social media can be an excellent way of communicating with local people and we trust our staff to tweet appropriately and sensibly, actively encouraging them to be engaging and friendly in their posts.

'However, occasionally mistakes are made and we apologise for any offence caused by this inappropriate use of one of our accounts.'
