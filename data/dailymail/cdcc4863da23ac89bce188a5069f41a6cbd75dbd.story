The full extent of 'bin blight' was exposed last night after a report found that the average family now has to leave four waste containers outside their home.

As Britain increases its recycling of domestic waste, a survey found that nearly two-thirds of councils require households to have four or more bins and other waste containers.

One council – Newcastle-under-Lyme – even requires families to have nine, meaning they often litter the streets and cause obstructions for pedestrians and drivers.

Residents of the Staffordshire borough have to sort their waste into general waste, food, cardboard, plastics, paper, glass, cans, textiles and garden waste.

The survey was carried out by the National House Building Council Foundation (NHBC) as part of a report into how bins should be stored on housing developments.

Neil Smith, the think tank's head of research and innovation, said: 'It sometimes seems as if insufficient attention is given to how bins are accommodated on new developments.

'Designers need to find practical ways to hide numerous wheelie bins and other containers. Alternatively, the time may have come to consider more radical solutions to solve the bin blight problem – such as shared facilities on street corners or underground bin storage.'

Mr Smith said the era he remembered from his youth – when the 'bin man' would go round to the back of the house to empty a steel dustbin – were long gone.

'Hardly a feeling of nostalgia, but maybe a reminder of a simpler time when the terms 'wheelie bin' and 'bin blight' had not yet been coined,' he said.

'For my household, change started in the early Nineties when the dustbin was replaced with the black wheelie bin. Over the years, we have since amassed a green one and a blue one as well as a box for paper and a small bin for food waste.

'On the plus side, it's great that all the stuff we chuck out no longer goes to landfill; on the minus, Britain's streets are now littered with bins and containers.' 

Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said yesterday the Government was committed to tackling 'the scourge of bin blight'

The NHBC's survey of 325 authorities found that two required one bin, 18 required two and 93 required three. Four bins was the rule in 105 authorities, five in 69, six in 33 and seven in four council areas. Newcastle-under-Lyme was out on its own.

The report said: 'The widespread adoption of wheelie bins alongside the introduction of a variety of additional bins, boxes and bags for storing waste for recycling has not been without its problems. Uppermost amongst these are the difficulties households face in accommodating all these bins and containers.

'Terraced houses are particularly affected where there can be restricted access or no access to the rear of the property.

'The narrow frontage and limited front garden space can also impose further constraints.'

Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said yesterday the Government was committed to tackling 'the scourge of bin blight'.

'Far too many of our streets are still dominated by the ugly clutter of unsightly bins,' he said. 'This common sense guide, backed up by revised planning rules and building regulations, will help ensure that the housing industry raises their game when building new homes.'
