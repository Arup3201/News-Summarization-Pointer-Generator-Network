These are the amazing scenes where Israeli vets save the life of a 250 pound bear after it suffered a ruptured disc.

Zookeepers at Ramat Gan Safari park in Israel noticed Mango the bear was having difficulty walking and was in pain.

After several days, the safari's hospital staff decided to anaesthetise the 19-year-old bear in order to run some tests.

Experts at the Ramat Gan Safari Park in Israel believe this is the first time surgery on the ruptured disc of a bear of this size has been successfully attempted

A group of expert doctors from the Hebrew University Veterinary Hospital, headed by Dr Meirav Shamir who specialises in neurology and neurosurgery, were invited to examine Mango.

After diagnosing bear with a ruptured disc, the safari's Veterinarian, Dr Yigal Horowitz, sedated him and transferred him to the Safari Hospital - where a team of at least ten people were required to lift him on to the operating table.

Following x-rays and several tests, Mango was found to have a rupture between discs two and three - requiring surgery which staff believe had never before been performed on a bear of this size.

Mango's back was shaved before the complex ten-hour operation, conducted by Dr Shamir and assisted by Dr Orit Chai, which left his spinal cord exposed for more than five hours.

And although Mango is now back on his feet, he faces a long battle to return to full health.

A spokesperson said: 'Further x-rays were carried out following surgery which showed that the surgery was successful.'

'Mango will undergo a length process of rehabilitation and with much support and high hopes from the staff he will recuperate and return to good health and well being.'Â
