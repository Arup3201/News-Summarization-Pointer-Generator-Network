What man-made instrument spans 30,000 miles (50,000km), undergoes shifts in time and could be used to detect dark matter?

No, it's not a new super-collider, but instead the world's GPS satellites that provide us with sat-nav that could be used as a giant cosmic detector, scientists have claimed.

Using satellites orbiting around our planet, it may be possible to detect tiny fluctuations that hint at the whereabouts of the universe's elusive dark matter.

Scientists in the US and Canada say Earth's GPS system (satellite illustrated) could detect dark matter. They are poring through 15 years of data to look for small fluctuations in the space-time fabric. It's thought dark matter may cause noticeable 'time discrepancies'

The innovative method was proposed by Dr Andrei Derevianko, of the University of Nevada, Reno, and his colleague Dr Maxim Pospelov, of the University of Victoria and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada.

The two are starting to test their dark matter detection ideas by analysing clock data from the 30 GPS satellites over the past 15 years, which use atomic clocks for everyday navigation.

Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light.

It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see.

The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates.

'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist.

'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.'

Scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it. 

Networks of atomic clocks can apparently be used to search for defects expected to occur as a result of dark matter.

It is thought there will be time discrepancies between clocks separated at great distances.

Scientists are fairly certain that dark matter is persistent in the galaxy, evidenced partially by its ability to bend light around galaxies.

And it may too have a similar effect on a detector that's big enough to pick up such fluctuations - in this case the myriad satellites currently orbiting Earth.

'If the dark matter were not there, the normal matter that we know about would not be sufficient to bend the light as much as it does,' said Dr Geoff Blewitt, director of the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory, who is collaborating on the project.

'One possibility is that the dark matter in this gas might not be made out of particles like normal matter, but of macroscopic imperfections in the fabric of space-time.

Using the satellites as a giant detector may by sensitive enough to find evidence of dark matter. They are looking for a discrepancy of just a billionth of a second. But this would be enough to prove that dark matter exists in the universe (illustrated)

This two-clocks-illustration shows the pattern of how two atomic clocks would desynchronise and then resynchronise due to a lump of dark matter sweeping through a Global Positioning System (GPS) or other atomic clock based network

'Earth sweeps through this gas as it orbits the galaxy. So to us, the gas would appear to be like a galactic wind of dark matter blowing through the Earth system and its satellites.

'As the dark matter blows by, it would occasionally cause clocks of the GPS system to go out of sync with a tell-tale pattern over a period of about three minutes.

'If the dark matter causes the clocks to go out of sync by more than a billionth of a second we should easily be able to detect such events.'

It remains to be seen whether this 'cosmic kink' idea is correct, namely that dark matter is not uniform and constant.

Rather, the scientists say it is a gas-like collection of topological defects, or 'energy cracks'.

'The idea is, where the [GPS] clocks go out of synchronization, we would know that dark matter, the topological defect, has passed by,' said Dr Derevianko.

'In fact, we envision using the GPS constellation as the largest human-built dark-matter detector.'

If it works, it could finally reveal the missing aspect of more than 95 per cent of the universe.

There is evidence that dark energy accounts for about 68 percent of the universe's mystery mass and energy.

The remaining 27 percent is generally acknowledged to be dark matter, even though it is not visible and eludes direct detection and measurement.

The research was published in the journal Nature Physics.

Quantum physicist Dr Andrei Derevianko, pictured, of the University of Nevada has contributed to the development of several novel classes of atomic clocks and now is proposing using networks of synchronised atomic clocks to detect dark matter. His paper on the topic is published in the journal Nature Physics
