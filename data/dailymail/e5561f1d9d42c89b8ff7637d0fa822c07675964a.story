Pay packets for women in the workforce are 25 percent less than their male counterparts as it's revealed a third of companies have no females in key management roles. 

The largest pay gaps between men and women is in the financial and insurance sectors where the disparity in total remuneration rises to 36 percent. 

The findings were released on Tuesday as part of a comprehensive gender data report from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA).

The report shows full-time working women earn a base salary that is 19.9 percent less than full-time working men.

But when total remuneration, including discretionary pay like bonuses, allowances and overtime, is taken into account the pay gap rises to 24.7 percent less than men.  

The data collected from 11,000 Australian employers showed the pay gap between men and women was lowest in the education and training sector at 9.6 percent.  

'This data shows that women don't have the same opportunities as men to boost their earnings with discretionary pay,' WGEA's director Helen Conway said.

'Unfortunately, employers are not doing enough to address this issue. The data shows less than one in four employers has done a gender remuneration gap analysis to check for potential pay equity issues.'

While the report says traditionally male-dominated industries such as mining and energy are doing a better job  at promoting women into management positions, most companies are failing to maximise the potential of highly educated women. 

The data found women comprise close to 40 per cent of junior management, 26.1 per cent of key management but only 17.3 of chief executive officers.

'Women face clearly defined structural and cultural barriers in the workplace that make it harder for them to rise up the management ranks,' Ms Conway said.

Liberal senator Michaelia Cash, who assists the prime minister on women's issues, said the data showed there was much room for improvement.

She said increasing female participation in the workforce was essential to boosting Australia's productivity and economic growth.
