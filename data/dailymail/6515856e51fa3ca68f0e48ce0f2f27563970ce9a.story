With the trademark curly hair and giant personality, it is difficult for Adam Jones to blend into the background. The uninformed supporter still stops the Welsh prop in the street to commiserate with him on his country’s latest defeat, unaware that he is no longer in the squad.

Jones has been a household feature in Wales teams over the last decade and is one of the most recognisable and popular figures to wear the dragon red jersey. 

The 33-year-old has experienced some tough autumn evenings at the Millennium Stadium, but none quite as difficult as this November, having been left out of the squad for the first time in his career.

The frontrower admits it has been ‘tough’ and ‘odd’ as an outsider looking in, but has still not given up hope of making next year’s World Cup squad, even if it is just to avoid those awkward moments in the supermarket.

‘Someone’s wife came up to me in Tesco and said “unlucky at the weekend, you almost beat ‘em",' said Jones. ‘Then the bloke nudged her and said “he wasn’t playing, he wasn’t picked!” It’s happened a couple of times; people assume I was there because I’ve been involved for such a long time. I guess I’m quite recognisable with the hair and that. That’s been the hardest bit. I always had a good rapport but I haven’t given up on the dream quite yet.’

A summer move from the Ospreys to Cardiff Blues has given the forward renewed hope. Jones was caught in the crossfire of the funding row between the WRU and the Regions, which has now been resolved, and found himself unemployed and without a club when he returned from the summer tour to South Africa.

He turned to his first club Neath, who he joined in 2000 as a part-time labourer making patio slabs. They invited the Welshman to join their pre-season training and, after coming close to hanging up his boots, Jones was offered an alluring opportunity with the Blues.

‘I’d be lying if I said I didn’t fancy knocking it on the head and saying, “f*** it, I’ll just go to university or something”,’ said Jones. ‘I missed the day-to-day camaraderie of being in a team; all the chopping and the p*** taking. You become pretty used to something when you’ve been doing it for 14 or so years.

‘Not having an income was a bit of a ball ache too, but I’d been pretty thrifty so I always had a bit saved up. It dragged on for months but I was always thought in the back of my head that I still had something to offer. Then Cardiff came in on the Sunday and it was all done by Tuesday. The whole thing made me realise how important rugby was to me. I’d have been pretty dumb to pack it all in.’

A lack of fitness was Warren Gatland’s reason for substituting Jones 32 minutes into his milestone 100th Test against South Africa at Kings Park in June. Jones was left out of the squad for the second Test altogether and he has not played for his country since. 

It harked back to 2003, when Jones became known as the ’30-minute man’ after he was hauled off by Steve Hansen early in the World Cup quarter-final in Brisbane against England, but the latest episode was more painful. For a player who was being courted for interviews all week ahead of the Test in Durban, it was a huge crash down to earth.

‘It was my 100th Test match so to go from such a high to getting hauled off wasn’t nice,’ said Jones. ‘I’m not going to lie, the last week out there was hard work. I’m not sure how I would have coped without Ian Evans [the veteran second row]. I’m probably still bitter about it now but it’s happened.

Jones, speaking to the media during the 2013 Lions tour of Australia, has always been a popular figure 

‘It was harder this time than in 2003, because I’m so much further down the line. I’ve got to a certain standing and achieved things, so it hurt more. When I was younger it happened and I just had to suck it and see. But I understand that Gats and these guys get paid to make these big decisions and they have to do what works for them.’

Gatland turned to 21 year-old Samson Lee, who is regarded as Jones’ long-term successor. The Scarlets prop has started every Test since Jones was ousted and has the seal of approval from the man himself.

‘Samson is excellent,’ said Jones. ‘He’s been phenomenal for his club and I think we’ve got a little gem there. Guys like him and Nicky Smith will be around for the next 10 years now and I think Samson will be a shoo in for the Lions. He’s a tough little f***** and doesn’t give a s*** about reputations. He’s someone we can build our team around over the next 10 years.’

Lee may be the future, but Jones is not ready to consign himself to the past. Not yet.
