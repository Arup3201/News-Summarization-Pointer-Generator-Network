Five people have been killed and nine injured as shelling rocked a bus station in east Ukraine during the morning rush hour, ahead of crucial peace talks between world leaders this afternoon.

The attack in downtown Donetsk left several buses completely burnt out and the bus station suffering severe damage in what is considered a rare attack in the centre of the rebel-held city.

Elsewhere, officials in Kiev this morning said that 19 troops had been killed and 78 wounded in a day of fighting in Debaltseve - a hotly contested transport hub in eastern Ukraine. 

The deaths came just hours before the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany prepare to meet  in the Belarusian capital Minsk for crunch talks over the crisis in the country.

Other deaths - including 16 in a rocket strike on the city of Kramatorsk yesterday - took the toll in the two days leading up to the talks to around 50.

Donetsk city officials added that three people had also been killed in shelling overnight. 

Last night U.S President Barack Obama told President Vladimir Putin  that he should seize the opportunity of fresh talks and that Russia would face greater costs if it continued its 'aggressive actions' in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko this morning posted a statement on his website saying that he had made an impromptu visit to the war-torn region.

Poroshenko stopped in the city of Kramatorsk, some 30 miles  from the nearest front line, where nevertheless Kiev says 16 people were killed and 48 wounded in a rocket strike yesterday.

'We demand an unconditional peace,' Poroshenko said. 'We demand a cease-fire, a withdrawal of all foreign troops, and closing of the border.... We will find a compromise within the country.'

Officials in Kiev this morning announced that 19 troops had been killed and 78 wounded in yesterday's day of fighting in Debaltseve.

Poroshenko will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin later for peace talks in Minsk, Belarus. 

France and Germany, who are brokering the talks, have called on the warring parties to refrain from hostilities that could derail the four-way summit.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said this morning that 'quite a number of problems remain' in negotiations aimed at ending the fighting, adding that it was 'very probable' but not certain that French President Francois Hollande would attend the talks. 

Fabius said difficulties remain on the future of  eastern Ukraine, guarantees about the Ukraine-Russia border near the area, and the prospects of a possible cease-fire, weapons pullback and prisoner exchange.

He said the aim of the talks is to win an accord, but 'not just one on paper.'

Firepower: Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support separatists rebels in the east of the country, but Russia denies the accusation

Ahead of this afternoon's discussions, representatives of the separatists, Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe met for talks in Minsk.

These consultations will continue this afternoon, Russian presidential aide Vladislav Surkov said. Asked whether any progress has been achieved already, Surkov said 'it's too early to say.'

Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support separatists rebels in the east of the country, but Russia denies the accusation.

The US and the UK have warned that they may send lethal arms to help the Ukrainians defend themselves if the summit fails.

Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande, however, are against any weapons being sent.

David Cameron, who has been criticised for not attending the summit, told the Commons that aggression and brutality should not be rewarded with appeasement.

More than 5,400 people have died since the conflict began last year, with civilian casualties rising dramatically in recent weeks. 

263 civilians were killed in populated areas between 31 January and 5 February alone.
