Fans of new Ewan MacGregor film Salmon Fishing in the Yemen have been bombarding the country's tourist board with requests to try out its angling scene.

Yemeni officials have been 'inundated' with queries from people hoping to visit since the film's release - despite the fact the country is the scene of major unrest and does not have a climate suited to salmon fishing.

Britain's Foreign Office has warned against all travel to Yemen, which lies on the Arabian Peninsula, citing 'violent clashes, a threat of kidnap by armed tribes, criminals and terrorists and activity by Al-Qaeda.'

Fantasy: Salmon Fishing in the Yemen follows Scottish actor Ewan MacGregor as Dr Alfred Jones, who is asked to introduce salmon fishing to the rivers of Yemen by a wealthy sheikh played by Amr Waked

But the Yemen Tourism Promotion Board said the advice from the Foreign Office was 'excessive' and that some parts were 'very hospitable'.

Yemen Tourism today insisted there were 'lots of similarities' between the Arabian country and Scotland, where the rest of the film is set.

'We're definitely looking to build some sort of connection between the two countries following the film, said UK spokesman Benjamin Carey.

'One
negative is that salmon fishing isn't actually that popular in Yemen, 
but there are excellent sea fishing opportunities in the country.'

The film, based on the popular book by Paul Torday, follows Scottish MacGregor as Dr Alfred Jones, who is asked to introduce salmon fishing to the rivers of Yemen by a wealthy sheikh.

Mr Carey insisted the country was 'somewhere Scottish people might enjoy', adding: 'The bagpipes are popular in Yemen, 
and they also have their very own version of haggis.

'The country of Yemen 
is still very mysterious, which I think will also appeal to tourists.'

The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office last month issued a red warning over the Yemen, telling visitors to 'avoid all travel to the whole country'.

Direct cargo and passenger flights from Yemen to the UK were suspended for security reasons two years ago following a failed attempt to bomb an aircraft.

The Foreign Office website warns of the danger of reprisal attacks against westerners following the killing of Al-Qaeda Arabian Peninsula extremist Anwar al-Awlaki.

It warns that attacks against western and British interests could be indiscriminate, including targets such as residential compounds, military and oil facilities, and transport and aviation interests.

The EU is also warning against travel to the country.

But Mr Carey said: 'There's been a real surge in visitors to our website since the film. There's been thousands of visits to our website.

'Unfortunately the EU is currently advising against travel to Yemen, which we think is excessive.

'Some places are very hospitable but I wouldn't advise people to go to certain places at this time.'

Yemen was recently described as the 'poorest country in the Middle East' in a BBC review of the country, which also said it had 'become a haven for Islamic militants.'

MacGregor, who appears alongside Emily Blunt and Kristin Scott Thomas, said: 'We learned how to salmon fish as it's a very particular style of fishing and it's quite complicated to move the line through the air.

'Amr Waked, who plays the sheik, and I had to learn. Because we are playing passionate fly fisherman. 'At the back of my mind - as is mentioned in the film - the British fisher folk are quite a passionate bunch. I can imagine all of them being horrified by my fly fishing. I did the best I could.'
