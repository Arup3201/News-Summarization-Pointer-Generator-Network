Bravery: Charles and Alli Trippy tell their YouTube video blog followers the sad news that Charles is now suffering with cancer but that they have both vowed to beat the disease

Expressing their thanks for the support they have received since Charles' health problems began in February, the heart-broken Florida couple vowed to remain upbeat and have decided to ban the word cancer from their home as they both prepare for the long road of chemotherapy treatment in front of them.

On their October 4th YouTube video blog, Charles, 29 and Alli, 24, told their viewers that Charles' brain tumor which was previously a grade II oligodendroglioma had now been discovered to have become a grade III oligodendroglioma, which is malignant.

Looking to the plus side of the depressing diagnosis, the Trippy's said that doctors have said that the cancer is not capable of metastasizing - which means that it won't spread form his brain and will stay localized.

'We are both scared but we are both very hopeful,' said Alli during their latest video edition, which has been viewed by almost 900,000 people since it was uploaded.

'He has some very very good people on his team. He is most likely to be put on an oral regime of chemotherapy.'

Speaking about his condition, Charles said, 'I don't know why I have what I have, but reading the comments from you guys cheers me up.'

'There is no other option but to f**k cancer.'

In the most emotional segment of their most recent video blog, Alli leaves her viewers with a final message.

'We don't want the news to be shocking, please don't panic, please don't freak out,' said Alli Trippy.

'We are not freaking out, ou guys shouldn't freak out, we are trying to dictate to everyone how this is going to go.

'We are having to tell all our family and friends which his difficult as well, but we have a great support system and our medical team is amazing.'

Charles' condition first came to attention in February 2012 when he was walking back from a gig he had performed with his band 'We The Kings' in Boise, Idaho and suffered a seizure and lost consciousness.

It was in hospital that doctors discovered a brain tumor, that was at that time not malignant.

Charles and Alli conveyed all of this to their devoted followers online and on March 6th, Charles underwent surgery to remove the tumor near their home in Sarasota, Florida and Charles was allowed to resume touring.

However, he began to suffer a series of seizures throughout the summer which culminated in a serious one on September 3rd, 2013.

This led doctors to tell Charles he needed a small piece of his brain removed and on September 17th, he underwent the surgery while awake.

The 29-year-old remained awake but heavily sedated throughout the operation at a Boston hospital, and at one point even handed his camera to the surgeon so he could be filmed lying on the operating table.

As the camera is turned on him, he is seen giving a 'thumbs-up' signal, but refuses to make Ozzy Devil Horns, saying: 'I'll keep the devil out of here.'

Speaking to his wife, Charles even manages to keep his sense of humor, saying: 'Hi honey - I love you. Everything's going great.

'My brain is open and you can see the TV remote isn't there like we thought.'

The operation took several hours to complete.

The video diary charts his progress from his arrival at the hospital to a post-operation interview with Ali, who tells him he was hilarious even when he was sedated.

When he asks her if it is still attached, Ali says: 'Is what attached?'

'My head,' replies Charles.

But while Mr Trippy's achievement is impressive, he is not the first patient to have remained conscious during brain surgery.
