Corrupt: Former Essex cricketer Mervyn Westfield arrives for sentencing at the Old Bailey

Former county cricketer Mervyn Westfield was jailed for four months at the Old Bailey today for spot-fixing. He will serve half the term in prison.

Westfield, 23, was paid £6,000 to bowl so that a specific number of runs would be chalked up in the first over of a match between Durham and Essex in September 2009.

Today the Old Bailey heard that teammate and former Pakistan player Danish Kaneria told him that a friend would pay him to concede a certain number of runs off his bowling.

Prosecutor Nigel Peters QC told the court that the deal emerged when another Essex player, Tony Palladino, went back to Westfield’s Chelmsford flat in September 2009, where the bowler showed him 'the most money he had ever seen'.

Westfield pleaded guilty last month to one count of accepting or obtaining a corrupt payment to bowl in a way that would allow the scoring of runs.

Kaneria was arrested in connection with the case but later released without charge.

Westfield has received an interim suspension order from the England and Wales Cricket Board.

The court heard that Kaneria, who first joined Essex in 2005, was warned in 2008 by the ICC that he was keeping 'highly inappropriate company'.

Mark Milliken-Smith QC, for Westfield, told the court: 'It is clear, we submit, that Kaneria and his associates targeted Westfield. Westfield was on the verge of the squad, more susceptible for that reason. Less likely perhaps to be able to say no to the club’s international star, his future with the club uncertain.'

The match was one of the first televised games that Westfield had played in.

Mr Milliken-Smith said Kaneria took Westfield out to dinner with some friends, and said he had a way that the young cricketer could make money more quickly.

He said Westfield felt 'pressured' to become involved as discussions intensified.

The day before the game, the fast bowler, then 21, was told that people had bet money on the match and that if he did not agree to the deal they would lose out.

The court was told that other Essex players heard Kaneria mentioning spot-fixing but dismissed what he was saying as 'banter'.

Varun Chopra said that in a phone call in August 2009 Kaneria told him 'There’s ways of making money, you don’t have to lose a game'.

He ignored the alleged approach.

Mr Milliken-Smith told the court that despite these rumours at Essex County Cricket Club, a 'blind eye' was turned, and opportunities to report the allegations were initially missed.

Mr Milliken-Smith told the court that Westfield, who has played the sport since he was six, was 'an Essex cricketer through and through'.

He said: 'He bitterly regrets what he has done, he is utterly ashamed.'

Mr Milliken-Smith added: 'He is a life-long and passionate cricket fan and player. In fact, he knows no other love.

'The shame and regret he feels is evidenced at least in part by his admissions as to his involvement to this court.'
