Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said there was a 'lot more work to do' to speed up the deportation process

Foreign criminals will be able to stay in Britain unless human rights laws are changed, Chris Grayling has warned.

The Justice Secretary said attempts to return prisoners to their home countries ‘very often’ come up against the Human Rights Act.

He said efforts were being made to strike     prisoner transfer agreements with other countries but it ‘isn’t easy’.

Ministers have been ordered to step up efforts to end the scandal of more than one in eight prisoners being from overseas.

David Cameron vowed to end the practice of the British taxpayer picking up the bill for criminals with no business in the UK.

The Prime Minister said in 2010 that he would ’personally intervene’ to send more foreign criminals home.

But to date little progress has been made, and senior Conservatives have repeatedly blamed the Human Rights Act for allowing criminals to challenge their removal from Britain.

The Government has set out a series of measures to make it harder to challenge deportation proceedings, but Mr Grayling said there was a ‘lot more work to do’.

He told The Daily Telegraph: ‘If anybody said to me I think we need to deport more foreign prisoners and foreign offenders, I would agree wholeheartedly.

‘Very often attempts to deport (foreign prisoners) run into problems with the Human Rights Act, which is another reason why human rights laws need to change.

‘But there's a lot more work to do. We're working hard on prisoner transfer agreements with other countries, we're working hard to speed up the process. I'd love to say it was easy (but) it isn't.

‘We will do everything we can to improve the situation.’

Home Secretary Theresa May announced at the Tory party conference that foreign criminals will be deported from Britain before their appeals against leaving the country are heard

Under the Government's Immigration Bill, the number of grounds on which migrants can lodge an appeal against deportation are to be slashed from the current 17 to just four in a move drawn up in response to the 12 years it took to deport radical cleric Abu Qatada.

It will also aim to curb the number of migrants who block deportation using Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to a private or family life.

At the Tory party conference Home Secretary Theresa May announced that foreign criminals will be deported from Britain before their appeals against leaving the country are heard.

Mrs May said she was sending a ‘very clear message’ to judges who ‘choose to ignore Parliament and go on putting the law on the side of foreign criminals instead of the public’.

Ministers are close to striking a deal to send hundreds of Nigerian criminals home to serve out prison sentences.

Talks are continuing into reaching a compulsory prisoner transfer agreement, which could see more than half of the 500 criminals from Nigeria currently in UK jails repatriated.
