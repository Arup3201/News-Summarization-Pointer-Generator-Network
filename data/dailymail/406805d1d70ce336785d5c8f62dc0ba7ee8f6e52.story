Police arrested the parents of X Factor star Ella Henderson yesterday after raiding the family home as part of a money-laundering investigation.

Officers swooped on two large detached houses owned by the teenage singer’s father Sean Henderson, 47, and mother Michelle, 49, in the village of Tetney, near Grimsby.

It is understood that Mrs Henderson was arrested after police arrived in
force around 6am at  Tetney Manor, the £650,000 family home they built 
about five  years ago.

At least six police vehicles were parked outside the property yesterday 
morning and officers searching for evidence were seen going in and out 
with bags and boxes.

Mr Henderson, who is 17-year-old Ella’s manager, was arrested in London 
by officers from the Metropolitan Police. He was expected to be driven 
back up north for questioning by Humberside Police.

Officers: The raid at the home in Tetney, Lincolnshire was connected to allegations of money laundering

Ella is living in London, where she is recording her debut album. She 
was not available for comment last night. Her parents live at Tetney 
Manor, but also own another luxury four-bedroom property nearby, 
currently on sale for £375,000.

A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘There were police 
everywhere with cars and flashing blue lights. It was obviously a big 
raid. Sniffer dogs were out around the house as well.‘I feel sorry for Ella because this is going to affect her career. She has worked so hard.’

Another neighbour said: ‘This is a quiet, sleepy village. It is hard to understand what is going on.’

Officers left after searching the properties for up to seven hours.

Humberside Police said: ‘Officers executed warrants at two addresses in Tetney with the assistance of Lincolnshire Police.

‘A 49-year-old woman was arrested in Tetney and taken to Grimsby police 
station to be questioned in connection with money-laundering offences.

Swoop: Police raided two homes owned by the Hendersons worth a total of around £1million

Claims: The pair are now being questioned by Humberside Police over the allegations

‘As part of the same inquiry, a 47-year-old man has been arrested on 
behalf of Humberside Police by officers from the Met. He will be 
questioned by Humberside Police.’

Ella came sixth in last year’s  X Factor contest on TV and was signed by
Simon Cowell’s Syco record label in January. A spokesman for the 
company declined to comment on the arrests.

The singer has spoken about the influence of her family, saying: ‘Having
my father around me, that will keep me grounded.’ She has been in the 
studio this month working on her album with songwriters including Mark 
Owen of Take That.

‘What I am doing now is an opportunity I have been waiting for my whole 
life,’ she said in a recent interview. ‘I am back with my piano where it
all began, and I am loving having full control over my album.

‘I hope to have a single out by summer, and the album will follow after that.’

Ella said she returned home to the Grimsby area whenever ‘I have a few days off or need a break’.
She added: ‘I love having quality time with my brothers and sister, and, living in London, I miss the Lincolnshire countryside.’
