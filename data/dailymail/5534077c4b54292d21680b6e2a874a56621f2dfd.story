A 'treatment' for Ebola made from the blood of survivors of the vicious disease is being traded on the black market in West Africa, it has emerged. 

Health experts have warned the serums could contain other harmful infections as the World Health Organisation vowed to work with governments to stamp out the illicit trade.  

The 'convalescent serum' is made from survivors' blood, which contains antibodies that could help fight the virus, Bloomberg News reported.

Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO said: ‘There is a danger that such serums could contain other infections and wouldn’t be administered properly.'

A 'treatment' for Ebola made from the blood of survivors of the vicious disease is being traded on the black market in West Africa, it has emerged 

The World Health Organisation has vowed to work with governments in the affected countries, pictured, to stamp out the illicit trade of the 'convalescent serum' 

Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO said: ‘There is a danger that such serums could contain other infections and wouldn’t be administered properly'

The announcement comes as the WHO said new cases in West Africa are increasing faster than the capacity to manage them.

More than 2,400 people have died from Ebola in recent months and almost 4,700 people have been infected, making it the largest outbreak in history. 

Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat Ebola, though several are in the developmental stages.

Patients are given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and antibiotics to bolster their immune systems and help fight off other infections.

However, the blood of survivors contains natural antibodies that can protect against Ebola.

Antibodies are produced by the body’s white blood cells and bind to foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria to neutralise them as a threat.

About half of the people infected during the current outbreak have survived, providing a potential pool of donors.

The WHO is developing a system where blood from survivors of the disease can be drawn out safely and re-injected into patients. 

It comes as Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly donated blood to a fellow American aid worker infected with the diesase.

Dr Rick Sacra received blood transfusions from Dr Brantly shortly after he arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center last Friday.

Writing for the The New York Times, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy a the University of Minnesota, said those experts are loathed to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria.

Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.'  

But the chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate.

He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the ebola virus will change over time.

Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' 

But Professor Heymann, told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus.

'I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus.

'The virus's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions, which is exactly the same as other past epidemics. 

Dr Sacra, 51, has also been given an experimental drug and other treatments.  

He is close friends with 33-year-old Dr Brantly, one of the first two Americans treated for Ebola in Atlanta last month, after working in West Africa helping victims of the outbreak.  

'It really meant a lot to us that he was willing to give that donation so quickly after his own recovery,' Dr Sacra's wife, Debbie, said.

The transfusions are believed to help a patient fight off the Ebola virus because the survivor's blood carries antibodies for the disease.  

Doctors at Emory University in Atlanta and Nebraska in Lincoln, U.S. are also working on lists of survivors by blood type who could donate.

Mrs Sacra said she hopes her husband's illness and the experience of other aid workers can lead to new treatments for Ebola in West Africa before the outbreak spreads.

Dr Sacra was the third American aid worker with the Ebola virus to be flown to the U.S. for treatment. A fourth worker, whose identity has not yet been revealed, arrived Tuesday morning at Emory in Atlanta.

Few details have been released about the fourth American Ebola patient. 

But the World Health Organization said a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone tested positive for the disease and was to be evacuated Monday in stable condition.

Mrs Sacra said she knows her husband will be eager to return to West Africa once he recovers.

'I'm sure when he gets his strength back, he'll be ready to go back to Liberia,' she said.  

Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat the Ebola virus, but the WHO are developinga way of safely drawing out blood from survivors so it can be re-injected into patients
