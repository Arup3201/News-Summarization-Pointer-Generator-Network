If Mathew Carpenter wasn't the favourite child before he certainly is now after buying his mother a brand spanking new car for her birthday.

The brains behind the Ship Your Enemies Glitter business left his mum speechless after she was blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the amazing surprise.

The 23-year-old's mum had been relying on family and friends to drive her to and from work after her car broke down three months ago and she couldn't afford to get it fixed.

His mother had no idea where she was or what was in store as she was led over to the car

The footage shows his mother blindfolded in the front seat of the car throughout the 40-minute trip.

With a glass of wine in hand, she gets into the spirit by grooving to the music on the radio.

'Mum, where do you think you are right now?' Mathew asks.

'I have no idea,' she replies.

'Do you know where we're going?'

'Nup,' says Ms Carpenter, making dance moves in her seat.

'She's drunk,' a female voice can be heard to say.

She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw her first ever brand new car in front of her

Difficult to grasp what was happening, his mother silently walked over to the car

As she is guided by her daughter to the car she comments that it: 'it feels like we have gone around in a circle' when Mathew confirms that she had.

He then says 'mum take your blindfold off' which she does and turns away after being blinded by the sunlight.

Mathew goes on to proudly announce the generous gift: 'mum this is your brand new car.'

His mother managed to say 'oh my god' in between her jaw dropping to the floor and clapping her hands in delight.

Difficult to grasp what was happening, she silently walked to the car.

She slowly gets in the pink vehicle and looked around in a state of shock when Mathew asked her if she liked his kind deed.

'Oh my god it's amazing,' she eventually said looking in awe at her first ever brand new car.
