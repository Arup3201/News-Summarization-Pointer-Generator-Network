It is already the wardrobe staple and fashion safety net that women trust to turn 'fat' days into 'fab' days, and now it seems that the trusty LBD is good for your wallet too.

New research shows that the Little Black Dress (LBD) has an 11 year life span, with the average British woman claiming to have worn their favourite LBD more than 140 times.

The vast majority of women (91 per cent) admit to having at least one little black dress in their wardrobe, 48 per cent of women said they owned 
between 4-6 LBDs and a fashion fabulous 27 per cent of women said 
they owned seven or more little black dresses.

When LBD lovers were asked whether or not they had a favourite little black dress in their wardrobe 57 per cent said that they had one lucky LBD that they saved for special occasions while 33 per cent admitted that they ‘couldn’t decide’ which dress was their favourite.

The ultimate LBD is definitely a treasured possession: the average LBD was owned for ‘seven years’, with 'four more years' cited as wardrobe life expectancy for the item.

That equates to the average LBD being worn an impressive 143 times in total.

When asked what they liked most about their favourite LBD almost half, 47 per cent, felt it made them look good and 33 per cent said it was simply because it made them feel good.

Women wear their trusted LBD at least 13 times a year, with it carrying the through every social situation from work event to girlie nights out and special formal occasions. 

LBDs can be super short and sexy like Pixie Lott's dress (left) or more demure like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's below-the-knee velvet number (right)

A fashion fabulous 27 per cent of women said they owned 7 or more little black dresses (Sarah Harding, left, and Gwyneth Paltrow, right, no doubt own quite a few LBDs)

The few respondents who said that they did not own a little black dress were asked why, to which 36 per cent admitted that they didn’t like wearing dresses, while 27 per cent said that they preferred to wear brighter colours and 19 per cent admitted that they simply didn’t like black-coloured clothing.

The survey, conducted by www.MyVoucherCodes.co.uk, polled 2,137 UK women from across the UK, each aged 25-40.

A spokesman for the site said: ‘It’s
 great to see so many women holding on to their favourite fashion 
pieces, in particular LBDs, for years and years. This makes perfect 
fashion sense and it is also a great way to save money from unnecessary 
spending.

'Why
 buy a new dress when you have something that is easily incorporated 
with other styles and fashions that make you look and feel good at the 
same time!’

He
 continued: 'Before
 going out and shopping for new finds, make sure you have a good clear 
out of those unworn items – better to have a couple of classic and 
interchangeable pieces then loads of clothes and accessories that don’t 
go with anything and just gather dust at the back of your wardrobe.’

We love our LBDs not only because of how they make us look, but because of how they make us feel (unfortunately, they can't automatically make us look like either Gemma Arterton, left, or Kim Kardashian, right)
