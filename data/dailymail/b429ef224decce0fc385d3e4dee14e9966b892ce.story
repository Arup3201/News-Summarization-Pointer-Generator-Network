The great-granddaughter of General Foods founder and heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post has been found slain at her luxury spa resort on the Caribbean island of Roatan, Honduras police said Friday.Roatan police chief Alex Madrid said Nedenia Post Dye, 46, was found stabbed in her room on December 22. He said police had arrested a local singer whom Dye was helping quit drugs.

'She was a good woman who worked with young people at risk, drug addicts and alcoholics,' Madrid said.

The suspect, Lenin Roberto Arana, 25, told police that he and Dye had been romantically involved, Madrid said. Arana, who used the stage name 'The Canary,' told local reporters that he was innocent.

Madrid said Dye had been living for 15 years on Roatan, where she ran the Baan Suerte luxury spa.

Apprehended: Local musician Lenin Roberto Arana has been accused of killing Dye

Dye, of Santa Monica, California, told an alumni publication of her alma mater, George Washington University, last year that she shared a love of risk-taking and adventure with her great-grandmother, who inherited the cereal company that she eventually turned into General Foods Inc.

'My friend and I had an idea to start
 a business,' Dye told the alumni magazine. 'I wanted to go to Asia but 
she said "No, Central America is closer. If (the business) fails, we can
 swim home."'Madrid said Arana had been captured wearing blood-soaked clothing as he tried to flee in Dye's car.

'I'm innocent,' Arana told local reporters. 'Nedenia was like a mother to me. She protected me.'

Police said Dye appeared to have been stabbed many times in the back.

Madrid told Page Six last night: 'Señora Dye was murdered by Lenin Roberto Arana Carlos, also known as the musician Canario, with whom she was in a romantic relationship. We believe she was a victim of domestic violence.

'He allegedly killed her because he wanted to get crack. It was apparent he was under the influence of drugs. He has been charged with her murder. Her body has been transferred to the mainland for an autopsy.'

Other reports call Arana Dye's husband.

Roatan is an island renowned for its scenic beaches, scuba diving, luxury resorts and vacation homes.
