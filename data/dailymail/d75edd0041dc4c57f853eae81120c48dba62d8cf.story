Arnetta Welch, 42, pleaded guilty to hindering apprehension in two vicious gang killings in Camden, New Jersey

A mother has admitted that her home was the site of a gang-related double slaying and she helped two of her children conceal evidence after the killings. 

Arnetta Welch, 42, of Camden, New Jersey, pleaded guilty in Superior Court on Wednesday to hindering apprehension  in the deaths of Burlington County couple Michael Hawkins, 23, and Muriah Huff, 18.

The pair's bodies were buried in shallow graves behind Welch's house after the couple was tortured, beaten, gagged, stabbed and shot for hours at the home in February 2010, the South Jersey Times reported.  

Welch is thought to have purchased cleaning supplies and removed evidence of the brutal killings. 

She is expected to get a two-year probation term when she's sentenced in March.

Her children Shatara Carter, 19, and Dennis Welch, 24, were among 10 defendants, believed to be members of the Bloods gang, who are serving 297 years in prison for various counts in the double murder.

Carter, who was 14 at the time of the killing, was prosecuted as an adult and pleaded guilty last year to aggravated manslaughter and is serving 22 years in the death of Ms Huff.

The young Welch pleaded guilty to the same charge in 2013 and is serving 25 years in the death of Mr Hawkins.

The young man was beaten and stabbed before being shot.

Ms Huff was said to be beaten with a chair until it broke apart and choked before dying when she had a plastic bag put over her head, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Carter said at trial that her mother had tried to step between then-25-year-old gang leader Kuasheim Powell and Ms Huff during her beating.

The younger Welch told police that he stayed with his mother in a nearby room for an hour and listened to music after saying that she didn't need to be involved in the incident. 

Gang members said they covered Mrs Welch's eyes as she left the room.

The killers ranged in age from 14 to their mid-twenties.

The bodies of Mr Hawkins, thought to be involved with the rival Crips gang, and Ms Huff weren't discovered for three days.

Mr Hawkins, from Mount Holly, New Jersey, was killed over a gang dispute and a stolen bottle of liquor, authorities say. 

Ms Huff, from Cinnaminson, New Jersey, had accompanied Hawkins to the home and was killed to prevent her from identifying the attackers, they say.

Camden routinely ranks high on lists of the most dangerous cities in America, though its murder rate has fallen in recent years.
