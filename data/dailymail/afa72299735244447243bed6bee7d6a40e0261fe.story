Dispute: Nancy Dell'Olio leaving the £2.7million Eaton Place property

Once they ranked among Britain’s  golden celebrity couples – but now relations have sunk so low between Sven-Goran Eriksson and Nancy Dell’Olio that the former England manager has resorted to legal action  to evict her from his London flat.

On Tuesday, lawyers for Mr Eriksson and Miss Dell’Olio will battle it out in front of a judge for control of the £2.7 million property in Eaton Place, Belgravia, where neighbours include Lady Thatcher and Joan Collins.

If Mr Eriksson succeeds in his bid for a possession order, Miss Dell’Olio could be forced to leave the two-bedroom flat within 28 days or face the prospect of being forcibly removed by bailiffs.

Italian lawyer Miss Dell’Olio remained in the stucco-fronted building when she and Mr Eriksson broke up in 2007, claiming that they had a verbal agreement that she could live there indefinitely.

But the 64-year-old Swede claims he agreed to let her live rent-free for only a year as a gesture of goodwill while she found a new home.

Sources close to Miss Dell’Olio say she would be prepared to leave only after a financial settlement. A friend of Miss Dell’Olio said: ‘He told Nancy he would always take care of her financially. Their relationship went on for nearly a decade.

‘Nancy feels she is only fighting for what she was promised.’

Last October, a man thought to be acting for Mr Eriksson’s lawyers visited Miss Dell’Olio with papers believed to be related to his attempts to force her to move out.

Since then, it is understood the  couple have tried to resolve the issue but reached a stalemate leading to this week’s court case.

It is thought that Mr Eriksson wants to sell the property while he pursues football management opportunities abroad.

Mr Eriksson bought the flat, which is on the road used as the setting for TV drama Upstairs Downstairs, for just under £1 million in 2005.

Now its fate is at the centre of the final chapter in the chequered history between the couple, who met in 1998.

Their
nine-year relationship survived the Swede’s infidelities – with TV star
Ulrika Jonsson and Faria Alam, a secretary at the FA. They finally 
broke up five years ago.

Miss Dell’Olio, 50, has since gone on to enjoy relationships with theatre director Sir Trevor Nunn and former Marks & Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose. Last year she appeared on Strictly Come Dancing.

Neither Miss Dell’Olio nor Mr Eriksson is expected to attend the court hearing in Hammersmith, West  London, which is set to last just  15 minutes.

A source close to Mr Eriksson said: ‘This has been rumbling on for so long now that I think more than anything he just wants it resolved.’
