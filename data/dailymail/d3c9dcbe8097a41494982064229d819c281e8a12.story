An Indonesian volcano is thought be the source of a massive ‘mystery eruption’- the largest that has occurred in the last 3,700 years.

The enormous blast, which took place nearly 800 years ago, may have created a ‘Pompeii of the Far East’, according to researchers.

They believe this mystery city may lie buried waiting to be discovered on an Indonesian island.

The source of the eruption has been narrowed down to the Samalas volcano on Indonesia's Lombok Island. Its location is shown in the bottom image. Today, all that remains is a large crater lake

Researchers claim the volcano could also be one that started a 600-year cold period named ‘the Little Ice Age’.

A team, led by Franck Lavigne of
 the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, has dated the blast to 
between May and October of 1257.

The source of the eruption has also been narrowed down to the Samalas volcano on Indonesia's Lombok Island. Today, all that remains is a large crater lake. 

‘At the local and regional scales, the socio-economic and environmental consequences of this cataclysmic event must have been dramatic,’ said the report, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

This map shows the large presence of pumice- a very light and porous volcanic rock- of up to 50 mm at
46-km distance southeast from the vent on Sumbawa. Scientists claim this shows the huge magnitude of the Samalas eruption

The eruption was eight times as large as the Krakatau explosion which occurred in 1883 and twice as large as Tambora in 1815.

The blast was so large that it left its mark in the ice of both the Arctic and the Antarctic.

To narrow down the source of the explosion, the research team analysed volcanic ejecta chemistry, stratigraphic data, historical writings and radiocarbon-dating results.

Professor Lavigne said that while the 
eruption was known by many different researchers, the main problem up 
until now was they had all been working separately.

This map shows the distribution of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) from the Samalas eruption and location of charcoal samples used for radiocarbon dating. The enormous blast, which took place nearly 800 years ago, may have created a 'Pompeii of the Far East', according to researchers

‘The tropical location, the size of its 
caldera, the timing of the eruption, its magnitude, and the match 
between the geochemical composition of Mount Samalas ash with glass 
shards found in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica,’ wrote the 
researchers.

The team believe the volcano blasted 10 cubic miles of debris up to 27 miles high into the sky.

The fallout settled around the world. Near the volcano itself, it settled into thick deposits that the researchers sampled in over 130 places.

Further afield, the volcanic sulphate became locked in ice core samples taken from both Greenland and Antarctica.

Tree rings with abnormal growth rates, and historical records from as far as Europe, showed how the eruption disturbed the climate for at least two years.

Field observations on the pyroclastic fall layers from the Samalas show the maximum thickness measured exceeds 1 m, and cumulative fall deposit reaches up to 1.60m

Meanwhile, medieval texts describe unusual cold and wet weather the following summer in 1258.

Researchers believe that the Samalas volcano had a role in triggering the Little Ice Age.

In a 2012 study, scientists used climate models to show that a series of eruptions may have triggered the onset of the Little Ice Age.

Although the precise timing varies somewhat, this period is typically considered to have occurred between 1250 and 1850.

'A single eruption could not have caused such long-term climate change,' Erik Klemetti, a geoscientist at Denison University told The Conversation.

'Instead, it had to be a sequence of large eruptions, one of which might be the Samalas volcano.'
