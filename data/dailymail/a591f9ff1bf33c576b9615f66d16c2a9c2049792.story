Dental patients are being forced to travel long distances because practices nearby are refusing to take on new patients. Stock image used

Patients are being struck off by NHS dentists for failing to attend just one check-up, an investigation has found.

Others are having to travel to surgeries 40 miles away because those nearby are refusing to take-on new patients.

Some NHS dental practices have waiting lists of two years which is leading to many patients giving up and paying hundreds for private treatment.

Research by Healthwatch England, which campaigns for patients’ rights, found that only 1 in 5 surgeries are taking on new patients.

And in some cases dentists are striking patients off for failing to attend a check-up even when there are exceptional circumstances.

One woman from Bolton was deregistered for missing an appointment because she was visiting her husband in hospital with cancer.

Another 65-year-old man in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, rang his practice needing new dentures only to be told he had inexplicably been removed from their system.

The surgery refused to re-register him as it wasn’t taking on any more NHS patients so he was forced to pay £760 to have them done privately.

He said: ‘I’m a 65 year old pensioner, I called up my dentist for new dentures. I was told that that I was “no longer on our computer”.

‘They advised me to call them every month to check if they were taking NHS patients, but they were only taking on private patients. In the end I had to go private and pay £760 for new dentures and I am on pension credits.

‘It’s degrading ringing up lots of people, I shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to get new dentures.'

Meanwhile a practice in Plymouth, Devon, says patients living 40 miles away in mid Cornwall are calling up to register on their books.

Anna Bradley, Chair of Healthwatch England, said: ‘We hear a lot in the news about people struggling to access their GPs but it would seem getting an appointment with an NHS dentist is even more frustrating.’

‘Patients are constantly being fed confusing and inaccurate information about who is and isn’t currently offering NHS treatment, and are feeling like they have to opt for costly private treatments such as hygienist appointments so that they don’t get struck off the books.

Anna Bradley, chair of Healthwatch England, said the delays were 'simply not acceptable'

‘It’s simply not acceptable and such basic consumer concerns must be addressed when the Dentist Contract comes up for renewal next year.’

The watchdog – which was set up in 1991 – rang round 300 of the 8,000 NHS dental surgeries in England to enquire if they were taking on new patients.

On average just 40 per cent were although in Yorkshire and Humber the figure was just 1 in 5.

Another patient in Kirklees said: ‘I have been looking for a dentist for over 3 months and have still not found one.

‘I have rung the dentist but they keep advising me to call back after 2 weeks. I am now in extreme pain. I have contacted all local dentists but they are all saying that they will only take on private patients.

‘I don't want to be going to A&E but the problem is getting worse, if I had been seen 3 months ago then I might not be in the pain that I am in today.’

Concerns have been raised about the state of NHS dentristy since a contract introduced by Labour in 2006 designed to improve efficiency.

But it resulted in many surgeries stopping accepting new patients and up to a million are thought to have lost access to an NHS dentist as a result.

Dentists earn an average of £74,000 although the contract which sets out how they are paid is due to be renegotiated next year.
