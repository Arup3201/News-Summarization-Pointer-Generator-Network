The devastated mother of the millionaire Polish woman allegedly murdered by a British businessman in a Paris hotel room today demanded: 'Why did she have to die? Why didn't they just separate?'

Halina Wolf broke her silence about the death of Kinga Legg, whose corpse was found in a bathtub of a £1000-a-night room at the world famous Bristol in May 2009.

Ian Griffin, 45, is on trial this week in the French capital for killing the 36-year-old, and faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty.

But, speaking from her home village of Tlokinia, west Poland, Ms Wolf told MailOnline: 'For the last five years we have been asking why she had to die. Every day we ask why. Why did it have to be her? We just don't understand it.'

Wiping tears from her eyes, she said: 'It has been a terrible five years. And now it is all coming back again. All the tragedy and painful memories. We are furious that the trial has taken so long to come about.

'In Poland he (Griffin) would have been held in custody the whole time. But this man has been living freely in Cannes while we suffer here. He has been having his millionaire lifestyle.'

Griffin, who denies the charge, fled the scene of the alleged murder, leaving a 'Do Not Disturb' scene on the couple's door, and driving back to England in a Porsche 911 sports car.

Ms Legg ran a successful firm exporting more than 300 million tomatoes a year from Poland to major companies such as McDonald's, Tesco and Carrefour

The businessman, who is originally from Warrington, was arrested five days later in woodland outside Macclesfield, where he had been camping in a tent.

A long extradition process meant he did not return to France until 2011, where he was initially locked up in some of the country's toughest jails.

But – to the fury of Ms Legg's family – Griffin was controversially released on bail with an electronic tag in 2013 after complaining of extreme ill health.

He not only moved into a series of luxury homes across France – including a villa in Cannes and a luxury home in a salubrious Paris suburb – but settled down with Tracy Baker, an old flame.

Griffin told the Paris Assizes he had regularly slept with Ms Baker, 34, behind Ms Legg's back, and last summer had his first child with her.

It is common for murder trials in France to take many years to get to court, but it is practically unheard of for alleged murderers to be allowed home.

In response to Griffin's case, which started on Monday, Mrs Wolf said she was deeply unimpressed by the defendant's often repeated claim that he 'can't remember' how her daughter died, but that he guessed it must have been 'an accident'.

Griffin told the court he could remember arguing with Ms Legg before her death, but 'blacked out' when they were back in their room in the Bristol.

The accused said he went into 'a black hole' around the time of Ms Legg's death, and suffered 'from memory loss'.

'People can't remember what happened,' said the incredulous Mrs Wolf. 'Witnesses, him, no one.'

Mrs Wolf said the couple 'could have separated'. The couple had a tempestuous relationship. The court has heard that a month before she was found dead, Griffin had attacked her. 

Kinga's friend Jane Carrigan said: 'On one occasion Kinga phoned me to say she had been badly beaten by Ian, and was in the bath trying to recover.'

She said Kinga had claimed that Griffin had driven his Mercedes through the front door of their £3m house in Oxshott, Surrey, 'beat her then left'.

The court had previously been told that on the night of her death both had argued and that Kinga had allegedly been upset at Griffin's failure to have sex with her. Also, the court heard that Kinga was prone to drunken fits of jealousy that could be 'very, very violent' when she learnt he had been unfaithful.

But, when asked why they had not split up, Griffin told the court: 'When you love somebody, and get on really well, and some of it was my fault, you don't.'

Ms Legg, who was briefly married to an English civil servant but still sometimes used the surname Woolf, first moved to Britain in 1995.

She completed a course in International Trade at the University of Central Lancashire and – according to friends in Poland – always dreamed of marrying an 'English gentleman'.

Ms Legg ran a successful firm exporting more than 300 million tomatoes a year from Poland to major companies such as McDonald's, Tesco and Carrefour.

Her company, Vegex, had a UK base at the Oxshott executive mansion she rented with Griffin.

The fruits of her massive business success included renting a £10,000-a-month yacht called Overdraft moored at Port Leucate marina in the south of France.

She and Griffin were on their way down to the Riviera to stay on her before the fateful night at the Bristol.

Ms Legg first met Griffin in a Cheshire wine bar in the late 90s when – sitting with a friend – the entrepreneur sent over a bottle of champagne.

They met again in 2008 in Sandbanks, Bournemouth, and, within a year, were engaged to be married.

An ex-boyfriend now working in a hotel in Kalisz, close to where Ms Legg grew up, and who asked to be identified only as Tomek told MailOnline: 'Kinga wasn't really interested in local boys.

'I wouldn't say she looked down on us but coming from the richest family in the area she clearly had her eyes on bigger fish.'

At the time of her death, a Polish newspaper reported rumours that she had a secret love child. But a friend of the family rubbished the claims.

The local government worker said: 'I can tell you 1000 percent she never had a secret pregnancy or secret baby.'

Ms Legg moved to the UK after meeting Peter Legg when he was visiting Poland.

Legg was there as a member of the local Town Twinning Committee for Preston Town Hall, which is twinned with Kalisz in west Poland, where Kinga was trying to interest businessmen in market garden produce.

After returning to the UK, he and Kinga exchanged romantic letters for six months before she moved over to join him.

They married soon afterwards at Blackpool Registry Office but divorced in 2003 after she had a brief fling with Cheshire hairdressing and property tycoon Harry Gaynon.

The year before she had also met her next husband, Eric Kilby, the chief executive of Crown Wallpapers, while they were both working for tycoon Trevor Hemmings, whose interests include Littlewoods Pools, Blackpool Tower and CenterParcs.

Kinga was working in the marketing department while he was running Crown Wallpapers, as well as being a director of one of Hemmings' finance companies.

A married dad of two, he left his wife of 13 years and his two sons, and he and Ms Legg quickly became part of a moneyed crowd on Cheshire's social circuit.

They married three years later in 2006 at a 14th century church in the village of Opatowek, Poland, next to where Kinga grew up, and built a house there. This week, locals in her home village said the house had been sold.

After meeting Griffin again in 2008, Ms Legg left Mr Kilby broken-hearted by moving in with the smooth-talking entrepreneur who is now in court. 

Mrs Wolf said that she and Ms Legg's father, Jan Wolf, were asked to attend the Paris trial, but had refused because of his poor health.

She said: 'He has a weak heart. He has been having heart problems ever since this happened.

'We were worried that if he went he would have a heart attack because of the stress of having to relive what happened that terrible night. It's very difficult.'

Just up the road from the family home where Kinga grew up is the little Roman Catholic church she used to visit as a child, and during her return trips to meet her parents and brother Marek.

In the small cemetery where she was laid to rest her grave is one of the largest. Nearly 12ft wide the grave has five wreaths and seven glass candle holders.

It read: 'In different ways the heart demands. In different ways the mind thinks. In different ways the world sees. In different ways fortune rules.'
