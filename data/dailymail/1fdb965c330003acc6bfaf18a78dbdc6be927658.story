Amy Tatsch thought the worst had already passed when she was rescued off a Florida beach after being bitten by a 6-foot bull shark.

But as she soon discovered, her struggle had barely begun.

The mother of six, who was boogie boarding in waist-deep waters when she was bitten, says the next 13 days of her life were a 'blur' as her wound got infected from the ocean's bacteria-filled water.

'I really didn’t think I was going to make it back out with the amount of blood I saw,' Tatsch, 38, told ABC News about the attack that cut down to the bone on her lower right leg.

Doctors say that sharks' razor-sharp teeth aren't the only reason why their bites are deadly.

Infections, which are common in shark bites, can at times be even scarier.

'Sea water is actually quite dirty," Dr. Daniel Segina, who treated Tatsch, told Florida Today.

'Not necessarily polluted dirty, but you have animals that live in the ocean and there is sand and dirt that float around in that environment,' he added. 'The contamination factor of a wound that is suffered in that type of aquatic environment is very high."

Segina, a traumatologist in Melbourne, Florida, said he doesn't use chemicals to clean up the wound.

'Just sterile water,' he told ABC News. 'For the most part, it’s been shown to be the most effective.'

In Tastch's case, her infection resulted in severe pain after she the bite let her leg barely recognizable. She lost a muscle and her Achilles tendon was torn. She also needed a plasma transfution.

Tatsch's injury got even worse once it became infected due to bacteria-filled ocean waters. It took her five surgeries and copious rounds of physical therapy before she could walk again weeks later

Her accident was nearly three months ago, but she's only just started walking without crutches two weeks past.

She's yet to go back on a boogie board.

'But I have gone back in the water,' she added to ABC News.
