Bernie Ecclestone’s 40-year hold on Formula One could be over within days after a judge said the billionaire had committed bribery and lied about it in the High Court.

The devastating findings came despite Ecclestone winning an £85million damages claim brought by German media firm Constantin Medien on a technicality.

Mr Justice Newey’s judgment leaves Ecclestone waiting on Donald Mackenzie, the chairman of CVC, the private equity firm which has a controlling interest in Formula One, to pronounce on his fate.

Mackenzie, who rarely speaks in public, was again keeping his counsel on Thursday night.

But figures close to him told Sportsmail that during frantic conference and telephone calls yesterday several board members urged him to end Ecclestone’s reign.

‘This should have been dealt with at least nine months ago,’ said one well-placed source on condition of anonymity.

‘It has run on too long and it needs Donald to deal with it immediately. Bernie’s position is untenable.’

Mackenzie has been reluctant to sack Ecclestone, 83, because he has run the business so successfully - its annual revenue is £1billion - and there is nobody else who could take over immediately. All the papers are in his office in Kensington, London.

Handing down judgment in Court 17 of the Rolls Building, Mr Justice Newey said: ‘Even making allowances for the lapse of time and Mr Ecclestone’s age, I am afraid that I find it impossible to regard him as a reliable or truthful witness.

‘The payments were a bribe. They were made because Mr Ecclestone had entered into a corrupt agreement with Dr Gribkowsky in May 2005 under which Dr Gribkowsky was to be rewarded for facilitating the sale of (German bank) BayernLB’s shares in the Formula One group to a buyer acceptable to Mr Ecclestone (namely CVC).’

Ecclestone could face up to 10 years in jail if he is found guilty of bribery in a criminal court in Germany, where Gribkowsky has already been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in jail for accepting the money. That trial is due to start in April.

End of an era? Ecclestone was described as not 'reliable or truthful' by Mr Justice Newey

Ecclestone told Sportsmail on Thursday night: ‘I have no idea whether I’ll be sacked. If the board believe I allegedly lied and tell me to go, then that is what I would do. I would rather go on my terms.

‘I didn’t lie to the court. I told the truth. The judge just didn’t see it that way.

‘But even if I did lie and was unreliable, I have being doing a reasonably good job for 35 years. So why shouldn’t I carry on? It’s business as usual.’
