Season five of A&E's hit reality show about redneck millionaires, Duck Dynasty, premiered Wednesday night and MailOnline can reveal some stunning photos of the show's matriarch from her debutante days as a high school cheerleader and classic beauty before becoming a national celebrity.

Kay Robertson - known as 'Ms. Kay' - to her friends and family, is the wife of Phil Robertson, who recently made headlines over controversial comments he made in an interview with GQ magazine, and the mother of Will Robertson, the CEO of the Duck Commander duck-call empire, and the star of the show that put the Robertson clan on the map.

Beauty: Kay Robertson started dating her now-husband, Phil, when she was just 14 years old

Love: Despite struggles, the Robertsons have been married for more than 45 years and recently renewed their vows

Young bride: Kay married Phil when he was in college and she was just 16 years old

Ms. Kay was born in Louisiana in 1950 and married Phil Robertson when she was just 16 years old. The couple has four sons - Allan, Jase, Willie and Jep - and several grandchildren, including an adoptive daughter of Willie's who is set to appear on the show for the first time on the season five premier. 

But life for Kay and Phil Robertson hasn't always been duck calls and roses - before Phil became religious, he had alcohol and anger issues. 

In the 1970s, Phil was running a bar, drinking excessively and getting into fights. As Ms. Kay describes it, he was 'headed south.'

At one point, in a drunken rage, Phil Robertson kicked Kay and his entire family out of their home before begging her to come back.

'What kept me there? What made me stay with him? It was words my grandmother said: "One man, one wife, for one life,'" Kay Robertson told Sports Spectrum.

Phil Robertson turned his life around and became religious. Kay forgave him and the couple is still together after more than 45 years.

New addition: On Wednesday's episode, the Robertson's welcomed Willie's daughter Rebecca back to the bayou after an internship in Los Angeles

Television critics expected Wednesday's premier of the shows fifth season to be a litmus test to determine whether the show lost viewers after Phil Robertson's controversial comments about homosexuals that were revealed last month. 

'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right,' Robertson told the magazine.

Backlash from his comments led to a call for a boycott of the show, and had A&E indefinitely suspend the Robertson patriarch before backlash to the suspension led to his reinstatement.

'For Seasons 1 through 4, this reality series about a Louisiana family 
that makes duck calls was harmless fun for anyone other than ducks,' New York Times television writer Neil Genzlinger wrote in his column about the show's season five premier. 'Now 
it has been politicized, which is too bad.'

Wednesday's premier featured a new addition to the Robertson clan, Willie's foster duaghter Rebecca, who is joing her family in the bayou after completing an internship in Los Angeles.
