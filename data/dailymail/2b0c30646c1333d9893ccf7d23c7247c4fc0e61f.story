Tragedy: Banker Gary Clarence arrives at the Old Bailey as his wife is being sentences for killing their three disabled children

A mother wrote a letter to her husband after suffocating two of their disabled children, telling him she was finding it 'difficult' to kill their daughter after smothering their twin sons.

Tania Clarence used a nappy to kill three-year-old twins Ben and Max as well as four-year-old daughter Olivia, who all had a degenerative muscle-wasting condition sometimes known as ‘floppy baby’ syndrome.

In the letter, Clarence wrote to her husband Gary that she was 'so, so sorry' for killing the boys, and that she 'struggling' to take Olivia's life.

Clarence broke down in hysterics yesterday after the letter was read to a jury at the Old Bailey, and had to be excused from court to be taken back to hospital.

According to The Times, the letter reads: 'Gary, I need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take Liv's life. I am so ghastly and I feel every ounce of it for doing this.

'The boys were bad enough. I am struggling with Liv. I waited until the boys were asleep. The same with Liv. If I could take my own life and leave her to wait for you I would. But the wait will be as traumatic.

'This is so bad and I am so, so sorry. My only solace is that pain and future suffering I am saving her from.' 

Clarence was assigned a new, less experienced social worker in an ‘ill-conceived’ decision two months before she suffocated her three disabled children, a court heard yesterday.

She has admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility.

Clarence and her husband had been supported for 15 months by social worker Suzie Holley, who was ‘specifically chosen because she had expertise in looking after children under the age of five’, the Old Bailey heard.

But she was ‘suddenly replaced’ by ‘younger and less experienced’ Sarah Daws and quit her job soon afterwards.

'Gary, I need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take Liv's life. I am so ghastly and I feel every ounce of it for doing this.

'The boys were bad enough. I am struggling with Liv. I waited until the boys were asleep. The same with Liv. If I could take my own life and leave her to wait for you I would. But the wait will be as traumatic.

'This is so bad and I am so, so sorry. My only solace is that pain and future suffering I am saving her from.

'I am so sorry. This life is better without me. I am nothing.

'The only thing giving me the motivation to continue is the belief that the boys are already playing up in heaven like they could never play here. I can seem them running around...' 

Clarence, 43, killed the children before trying to kill herself at the £2million family home in New Malden, Surrey, while her husband was in South Africa with the couple’s eldest child, now eight, who does not suffer from the condition – SMA type 2.

Outlining the case ahead of sentencing, prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC yesterday said the ‘disruption’ of Miss Holley being replaced happened partly because the social services department thought she ‘had got too close’ to Clarence and was not having monthly meetings with the children.

‘Miss Holley resigned soon afterwards. Miss Daws became the Clarence family social worker just six months after she joined Kingston social services,’ she said. ‘With hindsight that perhaps was an ill-conceived decision by the social services department.' 

Friends said Clarence ‘constantly felt under pressure and criticised by social services’ and had been ‘very derogatory about Kingston social services’, the court heard.

Jim Sturman QC, defending, criticised the actions of the ‘inexperienced social worker’ and said her predecessor resigned ‘in disgust’ after being moved off their case because she was an ‘advocate for the family’. Last night Kingston Council said a serious case review was ongoing.

In a letter Clarence wrote for her husband dated April 20 – two days before the killings – she told how she made up her mind two days earlier, on Good Friday, ‘to say goodbye’ and her ‘plan’ had given her inner peace, the court heard.

She wrote: ‘I cannot face going down this path watching Liv and the boys continue to get weaker.

‘Most importantly, the interference in our lives (you know: GOSH [Great Ormond Street Hospital], NHS, Kingston/Moor Lane). I am tired of it all. No matter what we overcome, no matter what we do, it will never be enough.’ The court heard there was a ‘fundamental tension between Mr and Mrs Clarence and the plethora of medical professionals involved in the care of the children’. 

Nanny Jadna Coelho, known as Jade to the family, was duped into leaving Tania Clarence alone while she killed her children.

She had been told Mrs Clarence's mother was visiting only to discover it was a lie.

She then rushed to the south-west London home where she found the mother injured and the children dead in their beds.

Mrs Clarence then handed her a letter which read: 'I am so sorry I had to do this but I could not carry on. I also could not leave the children with Gary. It would have been too much for him.

'You have been the most amazing person in our lives over the last few years. Without you I most likely would have done this a lot sooner. Please don't think that there was anything more you could have done to avoid this.

'Please believe me when I say that you did far too much as is. There was nothing more you could have done. You were/are perfect. I am so sorry I had to end things this way.

'Please look after Taya for me. Taya and Gary still need you (very much).'

They included those from Great Ormond Street and Kingston Council, which provides support for disabled children and their families from its Moor Lane Centre in Chessington.

When the case was handed over to Kingston, the documents included a quote from Clarence ‘stating that she didn’t want to see her children’s suffering prolonged’, Miss Johnson said.

Relations between doctors and the family reached such a crisis in 2013 that medics were ‘actively considering child protection measures on the basis of neglect’, Miss Johnson said, although the children were ‘happy and looked after’. 

There were ‘up to 60 professionals’ involved with the three children, ‘often descending in groups on the home’, the prosecutor said. ‘One can well imagine how intrusive that felt.’

Yesterday it was also revealed for the first time that Clarence smothered the twins while they were asleep using a nappy ‘so they couldn’t smell her’.

She later told a doctor she killed all three children between midnight and 5am on April 22, the court heard. She found it harder to kill Olivia and wrote a letter to her husband between killing the boys and her daughter.

In it she said: ‘Gary, I need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take Liv’s life… If I could take my own life and leave her to wait for you I would… My only solace is the pain and future suffering I am saving her from. I am so sorry…

‘The only thing giving me the motivation to continue is the belief that the boys are already playing up in heaven like they could never play here.’

Yesterday Clarence stared at the dock floor clutching a tissue in her left hand, sobbing as she listened to the beginning of the prosecutor’s speech. Mr Clarence, a banker, sat by the dock door.

But after 20 minutes, before the details of how the children’s bodies were found were disclosed, she became too upset and was excused by the judge, Mr Justice Sweeney. The judge reserved sentencing until Tuesday.

An earlier version of this article followed incorrect agency copy in quoting Jim Sturman QC as saying that there was no evidence Mrs Clarence would have harmed a hair on her children’s head but for the illness they suffered. In fact her said she would not have harmed her children but for her illness. We are happy to set the record straight.
