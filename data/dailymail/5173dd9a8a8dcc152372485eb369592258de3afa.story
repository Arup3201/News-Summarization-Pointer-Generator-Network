It is strewn with rubbish, the ceilings are crumbling, and the carpets have rotted away.

But when this uninhabitable dump goes under the hammer tomorrow, it looks set to sell for almost $800,000, a price which could be so high due to the overheated state of the Sydney property market.

The two-bedroom art deco home in Stanmore in Sydney's inner-west has already received a huge amount of interest, with more than 150 email inquiries and 127 groups at inspections.

The two-bedroom house in Durham St, Stanmore looks set to sell for close to $800,000, despite the fact that it is uninhabitable in its present state

From the outside it doesn't look too bad, though the state of the house indoors is a different matter entirely

The property needs a lot of work before it will be in a state which can be lived in

The realtor estimates that with renovations, including a new kitchen, new floors and new ceilings, the property could sell for $1.2 million

The house is still littered with garbage, despite the fact that realtors have already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property

'The property had been very, very neglected and is full of junk,' said Ron Alexander, from LJ Hooker Marrickville who are selling the home.

Though it is littered with broken-down appliances, old clothing, and furniture, Mr Alexander says that the house is currently in a cleaned-up state and he has already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property.

'It's very run-down, very basic… But it's got a hell of a lot of potential,' he said.

The house is a deceased estate that has not been on the market since it was first built in the 1930s

The property is extremely neglected and it would be a huge job to renovate

The house is in a very derelict state, but is in an excellent location

There has been some interest in the property from 'brave hearts' - young couples who are keen for a renovation challenge

The house is in one of the best locations in the Sydney suburb of Stanmore

The property, at 19 Durham St, Stanmore has already attracted offers in the late $700,000s, and Mr Alexander expects to sell the property for at least that amount.

'The location is outstanding, it's in one of the best parts of Stanmore,' he said. 'The home has very strong bones.'

Ninety percent of interest in the sale has come from builders and professional renovators, but he says there has been some interest from 'brave hearts' – young couples who want to take on a serious fixer-upper.

The Durham Street home had a whole host of enquirers looking to purchase the property

The backyard is in an extremely unkempt state, and nine truckloads of rubbish have already been removed from the property

Mr Alexander estimates that if someone 'fixed up all the warts' of the house – putting in a new kitchen, new ceilings and polished floors – they could sell it for $1.2 million.

It could go for even more if builders extended the property.

The deceased estate dates back to the 1930s and it has not been on the market since it was built.

The auction, which will be held tomorrow at 1pm, comes just two weeks after a run-down shack in the nearby suburb of Leichhardt sold for $980,000.

The Stanmore property is a deceased estate in a derelict state with dirt and grime all over the house

The property is up for auction tomorrow afternoon and the sale price might reach $800,000, said the realtor

In many places the carpet and floors have worn through and would need replacing

The house is quite a fixer-upper, it needs new ceilings, as they have collapsed in some places
