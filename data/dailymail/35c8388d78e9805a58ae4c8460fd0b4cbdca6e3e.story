The man who created the 3D plastic gun is revelling in a title that has seen him voted the 14th most dangerous person in the world.

Cody Wilson, a former law student at the University of Texas in Austin, says he is proud that people consider him to be 'dangerous'.'I consider that one of the finest achievements in my young career. Probably never to be topped again.'

Mr Wilson is well aware of the controversy his invention has created, but disputes the fact that he is dangerous to anyone.

'Dangerous to who? Dangerous to what? How often can one individual p*** off the entire world? The entire world of financial and government superstructures?' he asks with a smirk.

'I hope to make it back up the lst, but I'll settle for 14. It was a good run.'

Cody Wilson: The law student says he is proud that people consider him to be 'dangerous'

Dangerous: Cody Wilson, of Defense Distributed, with the first completely 3D-printed handgun, The Liberator

Bang: This is the moment Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson successfully fired the first working plastic gun made by a 3-D printer

Blueprints for the first-ever plastic
 gun produced on a 3-D printer, that can pass through metal detectors, 
were first posted to the web in May.

Designs for the 'Liberator' pistol were posted online by Defense Distributed but
 the U.S. State Department ordered the website to take down 
the blueprints, on the basis that the plans could violate export 
regulations.

The 
blueprints, that could be produced on 3-D printers costing as little 
as $1,000, were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously 
designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing 
modern ammunition.

Mr Wilson made the schematics for the 
weapon available for free  - meaning everyone with a high-end 3-D 
printer can create their own version of the gun.

Practicing his aim: There are ways that this can potentially create a huge problem for the American public

Crude: The Liberator plastic gun is a simple single-shot weapon that fires a small .380-caliber bullet

Homemade: Cody Wilson's Liberator¿s designs were downloaded more than 100,000 times in just two days before federal officials demanded their removal in May

Plastic: Sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the Liberator are plastic, constructed by a 3-D printer. A small nail is used for a firing pin

Sixteen of the 17 parts in the 
Liberator pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the 
Stratasys Dimension SST 3D printer. The final piece of the weapons - the
 firing pin - is a common nail.

Mr Wilson told Forbes.com
 that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them. It is
 a bid, he says, to keep governments accountable to the people.

'You
 can print a lethal device. It’s kind of scary, but that’s what we’re 
aiming to show,' he said. 'Anywhere there’s a computer and an Internet 
connection, there would be the promise of a gun.'

The name of the gun - Liberator - comes from a simple World War II pistol that was designed by the U.S. military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied Europe and concentration camps.

Like its World War II predecessor, the Defense Distributed pistol is a crude weapon. It holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore.

3-D printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine, to construction to aerospace.

The process, also called additive manufacturing, creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model.

The feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic. The layers are then joined together to create the final shape.

The machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing.

The process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s.

However, since 2010, an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3-D printers, which are increasingly small, increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable.

Defense Distributed used a higher-end $8,000 model to build its 3-D gun.

However entry-level desktop models can cost $500 to $1,000.

The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace.

Engineers hope 3-D printing will begin an era of 'instant prototyping' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively.

The group has successfully fired it 
with a .380-caliber pistol round.

However, an attempt to shoot a 
slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces. 

Currently, the Liberator can only be 
made through highly specialized processes on an $8,000 3-D printer.

Mr 
Wilson says he hopes to adapt the model

The technology behind 3-D printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades.

It
 is only since about 2010, though, that 3-D printers have become cheap 
enough, simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to 
purchase.

The guns are made out of plastic, so 
they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or 
sporting event.

The only
 metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to
 be detected by metal detectors, for instance, when you go through an 
airport.

Current law bans 
all-plastic weaponry.

Defense Distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle, to get around the law.

Worries: Officials are concerned about individuals slipping plastic guns past metal detectors and into schools, sporting events or government offices.

Dangerous? 'I hope to make it back up the lst, but I'll settle for 14. It was a good run', says Cody Wilson

Production: In an instruction video, the 3D printed gun is shown being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home

Process: Video shows the team beginning to assemble the gun after each part was printed and cleaned

Cody Wilson does not believe he is dangerous despite building a weapon that is unable to be seen by metal detectors

Pistol uses only one metal piece - a small nail for the firing pin
