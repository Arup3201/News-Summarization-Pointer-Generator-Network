A 13-year-old California girl has died after she ate a Rice Krispie snack made with peanut butter at a summer camp and had an intense allergic reaction.

Natalie Giorgio, from Carmichael, California, was with her family at Camp Sacramento in El Dorado County when she ate the dessert on Friday night not realizing it contained nuts.

The girl immediately spat out the treat but it was too late. After 20 minutes, she began vomiting, had trouble breathing then suffered anaphylactic shock and cardiac arrest.

She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead.

A family friend told 10 News that Natalie's physician father, Louis Giorgi, administered three Epipens, an injection device used to deliver epinephrine, on his daughter but they could not save her. He also gave her oxygen.

Natalie was always vigilant about her allergy, said Pastor Michael Kiernan of Our Lady of the Assumption Church in Carmichael. her twin sister was also allergic to peanuts.

'She took every care. She knew the situation, that's (connected to) the allergy she had. And they were really on it all the time,' he told the station.

But on Friday night, the last night of camp, the tray of refreshments was placed in a dark area of the camp.

After the young teen took a bite out of the treat she knew something wasn't right an spat it out before rushing to tell her mother who also tasted the treat. But it was only later they realized it contained peanut butter.

The distraught family are trying to get the message out about how dangerous food allergies can be.

'While our hearts are breaking over 
the tragic loss of our beautiful daughter Natalie, it is our hope that 
others can learn from this and realize that nut and food allergies are 
life threatening,' the family said in a statement.

'Caution and care for
those inflicted should always be supported and taken.'

Her parents also thanked the paramedics, firefighters and other first responders who tried to save the little girl.

A special vigil was held at Our Lady of Assumption Church in Carmichael for Natalie, who would have gone into eighth grade next year at the parish school, on Sunday evening.

Family and friends said the young teen loved to draw and was always smiling and laughing. She wanted to become a neonatologist when she grew up, so she could care for premature babies like her and her twin sister.

Camp Sacramento, located along Highway 50 in the Eldorado National Forest, is on a 14-acre property owned by the U.S. Forest Service and leased by the City of Sacramento.
