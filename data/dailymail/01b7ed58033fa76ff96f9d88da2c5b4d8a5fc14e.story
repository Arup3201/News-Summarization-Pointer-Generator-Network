ISIS has murdered 17 men in Syria over the past two days according to a human rights monitoring organisation as the terror group struggles to keep hold of its self-proclaimed caliphate. 

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the victims were either beheaded or shot in response to a series of hit-and-run guerrilla-style attacks on the terror group which killed ten terrorists. 

ISIS is being attacked on several fronts by forces loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, rival insurgent groups as well as coalition airstrikes.

ISIS has been executing civilians in Syria in response to guerrilla attacks on the terror group

Human rights activists said 17 civilians have been killed by ISIS in the Deir  al-Zor province in recent days

The men were blindfolded and led to the centre of a public square where they were shot or beheaded

The terror group, who claims to control large sections of Syria and Iraq has been hit in its stronghold of the Deir al-Zor province, from Raqqa, down as far as the town of al-Mayadin, along the banks of the River Euphrates. 

Syrian state news agency SANA reported that ISIS executed three civilians in al-Mayadin, before putting their bodies on public display. 

The United Nations believes that more than 200,000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war over the past four years. 

Syrian media claims that the attacks on ISIS, which have not been claimed by any particular group or state agency are part of a 'popular resistance' to the terror group. 

Meanwhile Turkey's prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said his country may increase the size of militarised zones along the country's border with Syria to prevent western Jihadi tourists from joining ISIS. 

He said: 'On the border, up to now, there are refugee camps, there are certain places where there is much more strict control. 

'These military zones might be enlarged," Davutoglu said, adding that Turkey had so far been reluctant to do this so as not to deter refugees.

'The source of the problem is the Assad regime's brutality ... (We want a) no-fly zone ... so that Aleppo will be protected at least against the air bombardment and there will be no new refugees coming to Turkey.'

Images of the chilling murders were broadcast on the internet through Jihadi-friendly websites
