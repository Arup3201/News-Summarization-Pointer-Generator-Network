Emirates has suspended flights to Guinea over fears of spreading the Ebola virus.

The Dubai-based carrier is the first major international airline to cancel flights due to the epidemic which has taken hold in West Africa.

However, British Airways continues to operate its flight from Liberia to London Heathrow, which also stops at Lungi International Airport in Sierra Leone.  

Emirates has suspended flights to Conakry after there was an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea

Emirates confirmed the decision to suspend flights Conakry came after there was an outbreak of the virus in Guinea.

The suspension of the route follows a similar decision by Pan-African airlines Arik and ASKY, which have stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

A spokesperson for Emirates said: 'Emirates will be suspending its service to Conakry from (Saturday) 2 August, 2014 until further notice, due to the outbreak of the Ebola virus in Guinea.

'We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers. However the safety of our passengers and crew is of the highest priority and will not be compromised.'

British Airways also released a statement, saying: 'The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority.

'We fully comply with the guidance provided by local health authorities and continue to monitor the situation closely.'

The current Ebola outbreak is the largest ever recorded since the virus was first detected in 1976, with more than 1,200 cases so far.

It far exceeds the next largest outbreak, involving 425 cases. 

Around 60 per cent of cases so far have been fatal and more than 700 people have died since the start of February.

The outbreak began in Sierra Leone and has spread to Liberia, with a Liberian also dying in Lagos, Nigeria last week, after a flight from his home country.

Following his death, both Arik and ASKY halted all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone. 

Guinea's capital Conakry will not be serviced by Emirates flights until further notice

Despite fears over flights still operating into and out of West Africa - often with direct routes to London - the Foreign Office claims Border Staff have been trained to recognise symptoms.

A statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) read: 'Border Force has been working closely with Public Health England and other agencies to ensure staff are prepared to deal with the threat of the Ebola virus.

'As part of this planning, guidance has been issued to front line staff on how to identify and safely deal with suspected cases of Ebola that makes clear what steps need to be taken should a passenger arrive at the border unwell.

'If a person is identified at the border as being a potential carrier of Ebola they will be immediately referred by a Border Force officer to a specialist medical care provider and reported to the Public Health England.'

Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to tourists, visitors or expatriate residents in affected areas is considered very low as long as they take the correct precautions.

The highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids, and unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes.

It is recommended that travellers:

The FCO has also stopped short of restricting travel to the crisis-hit nations, simply referring travellers to the National Travel Health Network and Centre, which offers advice on how to reduce the risk of infection. 

For its part, the World Health Organization does not recommend any travel restrictions to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone and confirmed there has never been a case of Ebola imported into the UK.

The leader of Guinea's Ebola task force has said that moves by neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone to contain the disease that has killed 729 people this year may have the opposite effect.

Liberia has put in place measures including closing all schools and some government departments as well as possibly quarantining affected communities. Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency and called in troops to isolate Ebola victims.

'Currently, some measures taken by our neighbours could make the fight against Ebola even harder,' said Aboubacar Sidiki Diakita

'When children are not supervised, they can go anywhere and make the problem worse. It is part of what we will be talking about,' he said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 57 new Ebola deaths on Thursday in the four days to July 27 in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria and said the number of cases had topped 1,300.

WHO director general Margaret Chan will also attend the meeting in Guinea's capital Conakry today.

British Airways has confirmed it will continue to run its route to Liberia and Sierra Leone

The outbreak of the virus, for which there is no known cure, began in the forests of eastern Guinea in February, but Sierra Leone now has the highest number of cases.

The haemorrhagic virus can kill up to 90 percent of those infected, though the fatality rate in this epidemic is about 60 percent. In the final stages, its symptoms include external bleeding, internal bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea - at which point Ebola becomes highly contagious.

The jump in the number of cases and the death toll has raised international concern and placed under-resourced health facilities in the region under strain.

WHO said on Thursday it would launch a $100 million response plan. The United States said it was providing material and technical support to the three countries and further assistance will be discussed at a summit meeting in Washington next week.

The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also announced plans to send an extra 50 health experts to help efforts to control the epidemic.
