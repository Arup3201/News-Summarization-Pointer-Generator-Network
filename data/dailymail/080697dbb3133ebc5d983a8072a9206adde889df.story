Since taking the Spanish throne, Queen Letizia has never put a foot wrong in the style stakes.

Indeed, her appearance at the Investigation National Awards at the Royal Palace in Madrid today was no different.

The mother-of-two looked chic and stylish in a red jacket  with scallop edged jacket worn over a fitted matching dress that flattered her petite frame.

When it comes to royal style, Queen Letizia is definitely one to keep on your regal radar.

Whilst she can’t quite take the crown from the ultimate royal style icon, The Duchess of Cambridge, the Spanish monarch is a close runner up, often spotted in a fabulously chic ensembles that we’re longing to emulate.

Attending an Award Ceremony in Madrid, Queen Letizia opted for a scalloped edge red skirt suit with button detailing.

If there's one designer she loves above all others it's Felipe Varela. Nine times out of ten Letizia will be wearing one of his creations, so we weren’t surprised to find out that this jacket and skirt combo are both by the designer.
