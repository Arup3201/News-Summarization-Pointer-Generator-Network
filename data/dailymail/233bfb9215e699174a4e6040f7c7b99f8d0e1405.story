London has been named the world's most influential city by business magazine Forbes, despite Britain being a 'second rate power' and over a century of 'imperial decline'.

The city beat off stiff competition from New York to claim the top spot while Paris came in a distant third ahead of Singapore and Tokyo.

London was praised for its strong transport links, long history as a global financial hub and lack of regulations owing to its position outside the U.S. and the eurozone.

Still tops: Brilliant transport links and an absence of regulations mean London retains its position as the world's most influential city

Trading hub: Stock market trade in New York levels are 10 times that of London and four times that of Tokyo

Forbes looked at eight key factors - the amount of foreign direct investment, the concentration of corporate headquarters, how many business niches they dominate, air connectivity, strength of producer services, financial services, technology and media power and racial diversity.

As the choice of home for much of the world's super-rich, London's enviable position as the historic capital of the English language contributes to its status as a powerful media hub and major advertising center, Forbes notes.

The magazine said: 'London not only has a long history as a dominant global financial hub, but its location outside the United States and the eurozone keeps it away from unfriendly regulators.

'Compared to New York, it is also time-zone advantaged for doing business in Asia, and has the second best global air connections of any city after Dubai, with nonstop flights at least three times a week to 89 per cent of global cities outside of its home region of Europe.'

London now holds the position of Europe’s top technology startup centre with more than 3,000 tech start up firms as well as Google’s largest office outside Silicon Valley.

However the magazine was quick to point out London is not the city it once was - and has suffered over a century of imperial decline while the UK is now a 'second rate power'.

Paris was in distant third place owing to it being home to almost all of France's home-grown companies

Neither it nor New York could not consider themselves to be the powerhouses they were throughout the 20th century and while Paris managed to slip into third place most of their competitors are now from outside Europe.

Forbes added: 'Paris may rank third in our survey, but it is way below New York and London by virtually every critical measure, and the city’s future is not promising given that France, and much of the EU, are mired in relative economic stagnation.

'Elsewhere, Europe boast a veritable archipelago of globally competitive cities — Munich, Rome, Hamburg — but none is large enough, or unique enough, to break into the top 10 in the future. East Asia is likely to place more cities at the top of the list.'

The magazine also notes the continuing decline of Los Angeles, once seen as a potential rival to New York.

LA, which has lost around 90,000 jobs since the end of the cold war, has suffered from a shrinking share of the entertainment and aerospace industries.

Last year alone major companies Nissan, Occidental Petroleum and Toyota moved out of the city for pastures new.

1. London (pop: 13 million, size: 607 square miles)Brilliant transport links and absence of regulations mean it's still top despite declining imperial power and stiffer competition from outside Europe

2. New York  (pop: 8.4 million, size: 305 square miles)

A close second. Home to most of the world's top investment banks and hedge funds. Its stock market trade levels are 10 times that of London and four times that of Tokyo.

3. Paris (pop: 12,292,895, size: 1,098 sq miles)

Way back in third place, but Paris stays strong owing to it being home to almost all of France's home-grown companies.

4. Singapore (pop: 5.3 million, size: 276 sq miles)Top Asian city - it has been named as the best place in the world to do business and attracts the highest level of foreign direct investment.

5. Tokyo (pop: 13.3million, size: 844 square miles)

Although it has fallen behind Singapore as Asia's top business city in the Forbes list, it is still the world's largest city in terms of gross domestic product.

6. Hong Kong (pop: 7.2 million, size: 426 square miles)

The largest financial centre in the world after London and New York, Hong Kong benefits from far greater freedom than the rest of China.

7. Dubai (pop:2.1 million, size: 1588 sq miles)

Dubai's unbeatable air links mean its the world's most connected city for business. It also scores top for diversity with 86 per cent of its residents born abroad8. = Beijing (pop: 21 million, size: 6486 square miles)Home to most of China's state-owned companies as well as the country's elite educational institutions and its most innovative companies. Beijing is growing in importance by the year.
