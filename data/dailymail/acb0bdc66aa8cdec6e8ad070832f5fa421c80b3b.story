A 19-year-old teen who allegedly beat up a Philadelphia park ranger who asked him and his friends to stop skateboarding was turned into police by his own mother.

Curtis Tanner, of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, was arrested Tuesday after a video of the awful attack surfaced on YouTube on Saturday, showing the ranger being tackled to the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched.

Police were able to identify Tanner from the video - as well as a 17-year-old suspect - and went to his house yesterday, but he was not home.

When he returned, his mother called police, who came back to the house and arrested Tanner, according to Philly.com.

The ranger does not fight back in the video.

He reportedly told police he was worried he would lose his job if he did fight back.

He suffered minor injured but was taken to hospital and is now recovering at home.

Tanner and the second suspect - who cannot be identified because of his age - are expected to be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, reckless endangerment and terroristic threats.

A 6ABC News reporter caught up with Tanner on camera, and the teen admitted to the assault.

'If I had the chance, I would apologize to that guy. I lost my cool,' he told the station.

Tanner claimed the ranger grabbed the arms of one of the friends he was skateboarding with.

Police also made a second arrest in the assault, bringing in a 17-year-old boy who was also seen on the video

'They probably didn't get all that, we were walking away but then he grabbed my friend and I just stepped in,' he said.

An online search showed that Tanner, whose Facebook page lists him as a 2013 graduate of Pottstown High School, has been arrested multiple times before by the Pottstown Police.

In October 2013, Tanner was arrested for robbery through force, receiving stolen property and other charges related to an August 30 incident.

Tanner was sentenced to five years probation, which started June 5.

After that, June 21, Philadelphia court documents show he was cited for disorderly conduct.

Court records also indicated that Tanner has been charged with seven different non-traffic offenses since he turned 18.Â
