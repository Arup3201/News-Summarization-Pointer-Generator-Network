How many calories are in there? Research has revealed that the average Briton's lunch could harbour more calories and fat than the rest of your daily meals put together

With working hours mounting, lunch is often grabbed on the run in the middle of a hectic day.

While your innocent sandwich may seem like a convenient option, experts claim that many seemingly nutritious lunchtime snack choices are laden with unhealthy ingredients.

Research has revealed that the average Briton's lunch could harbour more calories and fat than the rest of their daily meals put together. 

In fact, some sandwiches contain as much salt as nine bags of crisps and are also high in fat and calories, found Which?. 

That said, we need between 400-600 calories for lunch to sustain us through a hectic working day so how do you fuel your day the healthy way?

A raw food company says they have the answer as they are offering sandwiches packed with vegetables to revitalise lunchtimes.

London-based company Raw Imagination, which was established after one of the founders cured their asthma via a raw food diet, has created healthy sandwich alternatives to classic favourites.  

Every £5.99 sandwich is dehydrated (mimicking sun drying) and takes over 30 hours to make. 'You can't rush nature,' said founder Alex Stanton.

They decided to use coconut for bacon, walnuts and mushrooms for beef, sunflower seeds for chicken and cashew nuts for cheese and for the "bread" they use sunflower seed, flax, onion and olive oil bread. 

One of their most popular is a wholesome spin on the traditional British sandwich - a raw BLT. 

Instead of bread, they use nuts and seeds to create something akin to flaxseed and then cram it full of vegetables and smother it with coconut bacon - a mixture of coconut chips and smoked paprika.

They also offer a sandwich filled with sunflower goujons and a falafel sandwich with Brazil nut hummus.

Healthy alternative? Raw Imagination is a London company offering more virtuous sandwiches. Instead of bread, they use nuts and seeds to create something akin to flaxseed and then cram it full of vegetables 

Instead of a beefburger, the duo offer a portobello mushroom coated in 'cheese' - a cashew sauce. 

Speaking to MailOnline, the Stanton brothers said: 'Loving sandwiches and living on this lifestyle we noticed a gap in the market where we could offer healthy alternatives to typical sandwiches and snacks. Our idea was to develop a range of ready-to-eat, on the go, raw, vegan, fresh and organic food. Nothing like this in the world seemed to exist. This is where the idea of Raw Imagination spawned from. 

'We really wanted to start a RAWvolution. Our thinking behind the range was to turn "junk food" into health food, no easy task. We also wanted to make our food look like the traditional sandwiches that we all know but to ensure that they tasted even better.

'We went to work and spent hours on end trying to perfect our ideas and unique recipes. After much trial and error we managed to find the perfect blend of ingredients to create the sandwiches we currently sell today.' 

Raw Imagination is a family fun business run by two brothers, Alex and Oli Stanton, Nicole Nicolaou. Their mother does the admin, their father helps make the sandwiches, and their aunty is the delivery driver. 

Speaking about the future of the business, they said: 'We have been running for a little under a year and so far the business has trebled. We have lots of other healthy and exciting ideas that we are working on and some are already in development. Regarding the existing range, we are looking to spread the word far and wide. Ideally we would like to see our food in every health food store in London and eventually the UK.'

So are the raw snacks as good as they sound? Cassandra Barns, Nutritionist at NutriCentre.com, thinks so. She said: 'This is an excellent alternative to fast food or a standard sandwich. The "bread" is made from nuts, seeds and coconut, which provide healthy fats and more protein compared to standard bread, and more vitamins and minerals – especially when compared to white bread. 

'This also means that it will have a lower glycaemic index than bread, so it has less of an effect on your blood sugar, and should fill you up for longer. It’s also great alternative for those who are avoiding gluten (or grains in general) because of a food intolerance. The filling includes lots of vegetables, again providing vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. 

'And the vegan alternative to bacon sounds good too – the coconut will provide more fibre and healthier fats than bacon, but is just as filling. The one possible drawback is that all the nuts, seeds and coconut could be difficult to digest for some people, especially those who are not used to eating lots of raw food.' 

The healthy snacks may be welcome news after research revealed that 3.5m Brits haven’t eaten a vegetable in the last week.

The ‘Vege-nation’ study  commissioned by Birds Eye revealed that over half the nation (53 per cent) eat two or fewer portions of vegetables each day, with nearly one in ten Brits (seven per cent) eating fewer veg now than they did as a child.

One in seven (14 per cent) said that one reason they don’t eat enough vegetables is because they struggle to find exciting ways to prepare them while a quarter (27 per cent) avoid vegetables because they don't know how to cook them properly. 

Almost a quarter (23 per cent) said they avoid buying vegetables because they have such a short shelf life and go rotten too quickly. Meanwhile, more than one in ten Brits (11 per cent) are put off eating vegetables because of childhood traumas and bad memories of school dinners. 

Worryingly, four per cent of Brits believe that pasta and cornflakes make up one of your ‘five-a-day’ and a disillusioned two per cent admitted they thought cottage cheese and croissants constitute one of their ‘five a day’. 

Tipper Lewis, Head Herbalist at Neal's Yard Remedies, added: 'There has been such a notable movement towards consumers eating clean and taking responsibility for their health. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle is something we have always been very passionate about at Neal's Yard Remedies, we have always believed in educating our customers on ingredients so that they can make informed decisions on what to feed their bodies with.

'Superfood's are natures most nutritionally dense foods packed full of nutrients including vitamins, minerals and antioxidants and pack a supercharged boost of energy.'
