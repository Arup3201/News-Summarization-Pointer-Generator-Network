A Chinese man has a basketball sized 'head' growing from the left side of his chest as doctors attempt to create him a new face.

Yan Jianbin suffered severe burns to his face when he was electrocuted.

As he opened the door of a high-voltage transformer to peer inside, he suffered the powerful shock.

The technician was left severely disfigured having lost his right eye and nose.

Yan Jianbin suffered severe burns when he was electrocuted. Doctors are in the process of growing him a new face on the left side of his chest, (right) after he lost his right eye and nose

Surgeons have, for the last six months, been injecting saline into Yan's chest to stretch the skin. They now hope to create new facial features, using the guide, above 

But doctors at the Shenyang Army General Hospital, in Liaoning Province, said they hope to create a new face for Yan.

Six months ago they embarked on a detailed procedure to stretch the skin on the left side of his chest.

The aim was to create a head-shaped mound, by injecting saline water into his chest to expand the skin.

The skin has now expanded to the point where plastic surgeons can begin the task of creating new facial features for Yan.

The next stage will involve reattaching his new face to his damaged skin.

Thanks to the saline injections, the skin has now expanded to the point where plastic surgeons can begin the task of creating new facial features for Yan

Doctors said the whole procedures will be broken down into five complex stages.

The first two phases involve building Yan a new nose. Surgeons will use part of his rib cartilage and newly created skin to form his new nose.

The third phase involves creating new blood vessels and arteries.

The fourth is the face transplantation, while the last phase will involve details carving to finish the process, and fine-tune Yan's new facial features.

Surgeons said the whole process will take at least two years.  

A team of Chinese doctors gave a teenage girl a new face after growing a graft on her breast.

Xu Jianmei, 17, had been left disfigured by a fire when she was five years old.

Last year it emerged she had surgery in the city of Fuzhou, in Fujian province, in the southeast of the country.

Waking from the operation the teenage discovered she once again had a chin, eyelids and an ear.

Xu Jianmei, 17, was left disfigured by a fire when she was five years old. Last year surgeons gave her a new face, allowing her to smile for the first time in 12 years

Doctors stretched the skin on her chest to create enough to make a new face

But she said the best thing about having the surgery, was gaining the ability to smile for the first time in 12 years.

Ms Xu's parents could not afford the operation but she was given hope when doctors offered to carry out the pioneering procedure free.

The transplant team implanted a blood vessel from her leg into her chest and used a water-filled balloon to expand her skin, to create enough to make a new face.

‘With her new face she will be able to express herself in a more precise way. She will even be able to blush when her emotions change, but it will take a long time,’ her surgeon, Jiang Chenhong, said at the time.

‘First, we took a piece of blood vessel fascia from her thigh and implanted it in her chest.

‘Then we inserted a skin expander beneath the part of skin where the blood vessel fascia was planted, so that the part could expand and produce enough skin for her new face,’ he added.
