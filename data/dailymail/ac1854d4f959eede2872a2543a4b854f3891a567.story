More details about the alleged victim are being circulated on social media but MailOnline has been unable to verify them and has decided not to publish them.

In her report Kelly said: ‘Washington's sudden departure from the club was due to impending legal issues stemming from an alleged sexual assault of a reporter.’

She cited a ‘a source with knowledge of the situation’ but did not elaborate further in the short post.

MailOnline understands that there are only a handful of female reporters who cover the Rangers full time.

A spokeswoman for the North Texas District Attorney’s office, which covers the Dallas Fort Worth area, said she was ‘not aware’ of any investigation.

However the victim may not yet have come forward and spoken to police, meaning that prosecutors would not have spoken to her yet.

Kelly did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Washington did not reveal exactly what he had done to break his wife’s trust, but said he said he was more embarrassed than he has ever been in his life as he spoke before reporters in a Las Colinas hotel meeting room.

'All I ask is for your forgiveness and your understanding.'  

'This matter is certainly personal, and we're trying hard to put it behind us,' said Washington. 'I was born to be a baseball player; I'm a baseball lifer.

His resignation earlier this month took effect immediately, with bench coach Tim Bogar stepping up as interim manager for the remainder of the season.
