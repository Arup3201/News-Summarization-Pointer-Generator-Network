A council employee went on a rampage with a JCB causing £300,000 worth of damage at the recycling plant where he worked.

Trevor Lewis, 59, used the digger to wreak havoc at the Eastwood Recycling Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire after growing depressed with work after suffering a knee injury last year.

Today, Lewis of Hebeden Bridge was jailed for three years at Bradford Crown Court after pleading guilty to a charge of criminal damage.

The damage caused at the Eastwood Recycling Plant in Todmorden, West Yorkshire after employee Trevor Lewis went on a rampage with a JCB digger 

The site is still closed after the incident in July with the local council estimating that the rampage caused more than £300,000 worth of damage 

Lewis arrived at the plant early on July 19 of this year and set fire to a container after buying £15 worth of diesel at a garage the night before causing the damage 

The court heard how one of the reasons he embarked on his rampage was that the site had made it difficult for him to work there by introducing steps during a recent refurbishment

As well as setting fire to a container, he also smashed six glass recycling contaiers, glass bottle cages and tore down railings and fencing, crushing yards of steel work

The court heard how one of the reasons he embarked on his rampage was that the site had made it difficult for him to work there by introducing steps during a recent refurbishment.

The hearing was told how Lewis bought £15 worth of diesel from a garage the night before the rampage at the centre on July 19 this year.

After arriving at the plant in the early morning, he set a container at the site alight before using the JCB to destroy everything he could by tearing down railings and fencing and crushing yards of steelworks.

The court heard he smashed six glass recycling containers, glass bottle cages, a number of lamp posts, site gates and several section of perimeter fencing.

Bradford Crown Court heard that once inside the site, Lewis gathered together used tyres in order to set fire to a temporary building at the recycling plant 

A burnt out container at the recycling plant, which Lewis set fire to. The court also heard how several police units were sent to the site where they saw the container completely ablaze

Over the period of time the sire has been closed for, the cost incurred to the council is thought to be worth £5,000 per month

Duncan Ritchie, prosecuting, told the court Lewis had been depressed after suffering an injury to his knee 18 months previously.

He said that new steps had been added to the site after the recent upgrade had caused Lewis feelings of frustration and depression due to his knee injury.

A complaint had also been lodged against him by a member of the public just days before the rampage.

The court heard he felt unable to tell his managers of his struggles with the steps for fear that they would hire somebody younger to take his place and decided he needed to destroy the site.

On the morning of the incident Lewis left his wife a note saying that he loved her.

As well as setting fire to a container and damaging recycling bins, Lewis also went around tearing down the perimeter fence and the railings inside 

Mr Ritchie said: 'The defendant used his keys and replaced the company padlocks with his own padlocks. Once inside he gathered used tyres and set fire to the porta-cabin on site.

'The defendant climbed into the JCB and embarked on the systematic destruction of all the equipment on site. He used the excavator to crush or knock down the equipment.”

The court heard that several police units were sent to the site where they saw the container completely ablaze.

Mr Ritchie added: 'They saw him trying to smash anything which could be damaged on the site.

'A PC approached the site at one stage and the defendant gestured toward the officer warning him away from the gate. He then brought down the gate.

The court heard how at one point, Lewis gestured towards a police officer warning him away from the gate before he tore it down 

As well as tearing down the fence, Lewis also pulled down railings as well as damaging neigbouring property around the recycling centre 

'The defendant went to some lengths to ensure that he was the only person on the site at the time of the offence.”

Kieron Green, defending, told the court: 'There had been a build up of frustration and depression. The site had taken on almost human form. He became obsessed that the site was ruining his life.

'He felt he could not continue unless the source of his despair and depression was removed.'

An estimated 15,000 residents are said to have lost the use of the site - which had only just undergone a £600,000 upgrade.

Over the period of time it has been closed and the cost incurred to the council is thought to be £5,000 per month.

Sentencing Lewis, Judge David Hatton QC said: 'You destroyed just about everything that was capable of being destroyed. The cost of your actions was immense in financial terms.

Lewis, who was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court today, said that he had suffered a knee injury last year, which caused him to become disillusioned with his job 

'It was planned and thought out. Thought out to the extent of obtaining alternative padlocks. I accept you have had and continue to have unhappy symptoms of depression.

'But I cannot ignore the enormous destruction that you caused and I cannot ignore the enormous cost to the public of that destruction and the effect on the community.'

After the case, Jan Lamping, Senior District Crown Prosecutor at CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said: 'Trevor Lewis took a JCB digger and systematically destroyed the recently refurbished Eastwood waste recycling facility.

'This act of wanton vandalism caused an estimated £300,000 damage to the site, as well as some damage to a neighbouring property. It has also resulted in considerable inconvenience to local residents while the site is closed for rebuilding.

'Today Lewis has been sentenced to three years in prison which I hope will demonstrate how seriously this type of crime is viewed by the police, by the CPS, and by the courts.'
