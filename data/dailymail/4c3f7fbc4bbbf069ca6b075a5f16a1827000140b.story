Luis Suarez has been named in the 2014 reserve FIFPro World XI despite serving a bite ban.

The striker, who joined Barcelona from Liverpool in a £75million deal, was sidelined for four months after chomping on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay’s World Cup group match in June.

But he still managed to earn enough votes from his fellow professionals to lead the reserve line alongside his Barcelona team-mate Neymar and Paris Saint-Germain’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

All three players shortlisted for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award were unsurprisingly selected by their peers to be named in the FIFPro World XI team.

Lionel Messi, Manuel Neuer and ultimate winner Cristiano Ronaldo were among seven 2013 team members who retained their places in worldwide voting by 23,000 members of national players' unions.

Manchester United winger Angel di Maria was the only player in the XI that is currently plying his trade in the Premier League, although his selection will have been based on his performances for Real Madrid and Argentina last year.

Lahm, Brazil captain Thiago Silva, and Spain pair Sergio Ramos and Andres Iniesta also stayed in the elite line-up.

David Luiz was voted into the defense despite playing in Brazil's 7-1 rout by Germany in the World Cup semifinals, when Thiago Silva was suspended.

Still, the Brazilian pair was reunited for a second embarrassing loss, 3-0 against the Netherlands in the third-place match.

Arjen Robben was picked as the only player from the Dutch team which started the World Cup by routing title holder Spain 5-1.

Toni Kroos completed the line-up as the third Germany player, and the fourth who played for Bayern Munich last year.
