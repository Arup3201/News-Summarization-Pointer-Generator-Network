A grandmother was needlessly killed by a rare flesh-eating bug after blundering NHS medics failed to diagnose and operate in time, the High Court has heard.

Suzanne Gardner, 60, died only three days after contracting  necrotising fasciitis when she slipped on snow in her driveway and cut her arm.

The infection moved up her arms and into her chest,  killing her at Christmas 2010.

But the popular receptionist's death could have been avoided if hospital staff had examined her sooner and amputated her arms in time, her family say.

Despite being in excruciating pain, she was not deemed a top priority when she went to A&E and, by the time she was diagnosed, it was too late.

Her widower, Colin, of Blisworth, Northamptonshire, is now suing the NHS over what he says was the  needless death of his wife of 40 years.

Given the choice of life or death, the devoted grandmother-of-six would have had no problem agreeing to a double amputation if that had been offered earlier, he said.

He said: 'She loved life. Her pride and joy were all her children and grandchildren. She never walked away from problems.'

Mrs Gardner cut her elbow when she fell in 2010, but she put the pain and chills she felt the following day down to a flare-up of arthritis or a cold.

Two days later, weeping blisters had begun to develop on her hands and arms and the excruciating pain became too much to bear.

She went to A&E at Northampton General Hospital, but despite her presentation, she was not considered a top priority.

Delays in examination and diagnosis meant the decision to amputate did not come until the morning of the third day after her fall and even then there was an almost two-hour wait before the operation began.

Mr Gardner had time only to wish her good luck and give her a kiss before she was taken away to have her arms amputated.

But tragically, the bug had already travelled up past her shoulder, killing vital tissue in her arm and chest.

The operation was aborted and Mrs Gardner, who was a receptionist in the village GP's surgery, died that afternoon.

The family's barrister, Gerwyn Samuel, said the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust was negligent in not making her a higher priority case.

Casualty staff should have spotted her intense and unremitting pain and had her clinically assessed sooner, he told the judge, Sir David Eady.

Such 'severe, significant, unvarying, excruciating pain' – out of proportion with any visible symptoms – is the hallmark of necrotising fasciitis, the court was told.

Infection expert Prof Marc Winslet criticised the delay in preparing Mrs Gardner for, and getting her to, surgery.

Mrs Gardner was taken to A&E at Northampton General Hospital in 2010 but not treated as a top priority

Had she been diagnosed and operated on earlier, her life would probably have been saved, he said.

He told the court: 'There was no reason to delay - time costs lives.

Necrotising fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs.

It can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister.

The earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain, which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection. As it progresses, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious.

The skin typically turns a dark violet colour, blister form and the tissue underneath begins to die.

Without treatment to remove the affected tissue, the bug will spread rapidly and can result in death. 

'In the face of necrotising fasciitis is no place for the faint-hearted, because you have to be decisive in your actions and very aggressive in your management.

'You would explain the life threatening nature of the condition and that time is of the essence.

'You have two choices: you either don't operate, in which case the outcome is inevitable, or you operate immediately, giving the best chance.'

In his career, he had never come across a patient who chose to die when given the option of amputation, he told the court.

Although its barrister, Tom Gibson, apologised to the family for 'failures and delays' in A&E, the NHS Trust denies liability for Mrs Gardner's death.

She presented at the hospital with only 'moderate' pain and so was given the correct priority status, it asserts. The hearing continues.
