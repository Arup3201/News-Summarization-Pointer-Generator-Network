A leading candidate in France's presidential election was left covered in white powder when a woman dusted him in, what was thought to be, flour during an appearance at a campaign event.

The protester - a 45-year-old woman - ran to the side of the podium where Francois Hollande was speaking and dumped the white powder over him in front of a packed audience in Paris.

Mr Hollande, who is the leading presidential candidate in the 2012 election, was at at the event to sign a 'social contract' in favour of housing for all.

Body guards who jumped in to protect Hollande also took a dusting.

After security guards restrained the woman, she was carried from the stage by her hands and feet.

At first Hollande seemed bemused by 
the attack, but he quickly regained his composure and as he continued 
his campaign appearance.

Despite his face, glasses, hair and 
suit being covered in flour, he proved he was all-white as he carried on
with signing the housing crisis pact just seconds after the attack.

After the attack, the woman shouted 
that she had been suffering from an injustice but did not go in to 
specific detail about her case.

Hollande has consistently led polls, well ahead of President Nicolas Sarkozy.
