Northampton's potential European Champions Cup group decider against French club Racing Metro has been given a Saturday afternoon billing.

Tournament organisers have announced the days and kick-off times for the final two rounds of pool action, which begin on Friday, January 16 when Leicester host the Scarlets.

Saints' January 24 meeting with Racing at Franklin's Gardens, when Dylan Hartley's team will push for a last-eight place, is among a number of key battles on the final weekend.

The all-English Pool Two encounter between Harlequins and Wasps will take place at Twickenham Stoop on January 17 with a 7.45pm kick-off, with Bath ending their European campaign away to Toulouse on January 18, followed by entertaining Glasgow seven days later.

The five pool winners and three best runners-up will contest the quarter-finals next April.
