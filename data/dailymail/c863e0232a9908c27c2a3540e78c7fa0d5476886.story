Sugary energy drinks may have cost athletes  a gold medal at the Olympics, health experts have today claimed.

Toothache and bleeding gums affected nearly a fifth of athletes' performances at the London 2012 Games, a new study has found.

Nagging pains in the mouth could have made the difference between medals by putting athletes off their stride, it said.

The survey found 18 per cent of top sports men and women complained the state of their teeth had a negative impact on their ability to perform.

Nearly half (46.5 per cent) reported they had not visited a dentist in the past year.

Saliva helps to protect teeth from decay and erosion, but becoming dehydrated from intense training can lead to a dry mouth, which increases the risk of oral health problems.

The amount of energy that athletes need for training often means they have high-carbohydrate diets and regularly use sugary, acidic energy drinks which may also contribute to tooth decay and erosion.

But simply flossing, knowing how to brush teeth properly, using fluoride toothpaste and mouthwash could provide the same marginal performance gains as expensive physical therapies, dentists advised.

The news comes after a study by German researchers published last month, which found the longer athletes exercised, the less saliva they produced and the more alkaline it became.

Alkaline saliva works to encourage the growth of plaque bacteria which causes tooth decay, the team explained.

For every extra hour of training each week, the study found an increased risk of a person needing fillings, or having decayed or missing teeth. 

Hang up your trainers - because exercising could ruin your smile.

German researchers found the longer an athlete trains, the more damage they cause to their teeth.

They found that the longer athletes exercised, the less saliva they produced and the more alkaline it became.

Alkaline saliva works to encourage the growth of plaque bacteria, which causes tooth decay, the team explained.

They suggested that running might reduce the enamel-protecting protein found in saliva, meaning even drinking water could lead to tooth erosion. 

For every extra hour of training each week, the study found an increased risk of a person needing fillings, or having decayed or missing teeth.

As part of the study a team of dentists at the University Hospital Heidelberg in Germany examined the teeth of 35 triathletes and 35 non-athletes.  

Commenting on the results of the new study, health experts at University College London said dentistry must be given the same priority as other sports sciences to help boost their prowess on the track, field or in the pool.

Professor Ian Needleman of the UCL Eastman Dental Institute said: 'Oral health could be an easy win for athletes, as the oral conditions that can affect performance are all easily preventable.

'Professional athletes and their teams spend a lot of time and money on ways to marginally improving performance, as this can make all the difference in elite sports.

'Simple strategies to prevent oral health problems can offer marginal performance gains that require little to no additional time or money.

'Things like better tooth brushing techniques and higher fluoride toothpastes could prevent the toothache and associated sleeping and training difficulties that can make the crucial difference between gold and silver.

'We do not want to demonise energy drinks and are not saying that athletes shouldn't be using them.

'However, people should be aware of the risks to oral health and can take simple measures to mitigate these.'

He said that water or hypotonic drinks are more suitable for hydration, and told athletes to spit out toothpaste rather than rinsing their mouths out after brushing their teeth.

He added: 'For sports where athletes need a lot of energy drinks, high fluoride toothpastes and mouthrinses should be seriously considered.'

The advice was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. 

Health experts said sugary energy drinks consumed by athletes might be to blame, and advised that athletes should prioritise oral health in order to boost their performance
