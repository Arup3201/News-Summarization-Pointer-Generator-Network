FA chairman Greg Dyke has conceded that there might be some truth in Les Ferdinand's view that covert racism exists in English football.

Ferdinand, director of football at Premier League club QPR, feels that covert racism has contributed to why there are so few managers from ethnic minority backgrounds in the English game. The former England striker suggested that some club owners and chairmen are being racist - even if they don't realise it - by not considering minority candidates, and has backed a Rooney Rule style law to be implemented in England to improve representation.

Dyke told Sky Sports News HQ, 'I think there is probably covert racism in parts of our society and therefore it would be surprising if it was not in football.'

He said, 'I don't think people are blatantly racist but I still think there are views and I think that we've got to change those.'  

Meanwhile, Dyke is hopeful that he will not have to force Premier League teams to accept his proposed changes to the homegrown talent rules. 

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of players per club that have been trained in England for a period of three seasons before their 21st birthday from eight to 12, as part of a strategy to get more Englishmen playing regularly in the top flight.   

He explained, 'This is not something we want to enforce. What we would like is to have a discussion with the clubs, with the leagues, 'these are our ideas, these are their ideas,' it's exactly what we did on overseas players outside of Europe and we came up with a solution which will reduce the numbers - that's what we would like to do on this.'
