Former U.S presidential candidate Mitt Romney has admitted regret over his secretly-recorded remarks in which he claimed 47 per cent of Americans were dependent on government.

Romney admitted being 'very upset' over the comment in one of his only full, in-depth interviews since his defeat to Barack Obama in the fiercely-fought presidential race last year.

During the wide-ranging interview,  Ann Romney also revealed how she took defeat the hardest, strongly believing her husband would win. During a more lighthearted moment, she even told how  Mitt now helps out with the laundry at home.

But it was Mitt's comments about the 47 per cent remark which were the most striking of the CNN interview.

The secretly-recorded comments were made during a Florida fundraiser in which he claimed 'there are 47 per cent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what' because they are 'dependent on government'

He added they 'believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.'

The comments were pounced on by the Democrats and provoked a media storm and proved to be decisive in the outcome of the race for the White House.

When asked by CNN's Gloria Borger if he kicked himself over the remark, Mitt replied: 'Oh, yes.  I was very upset. There were a number of times that I said things that didn't come out right.

'And one of the interesting things about campaigns today, unlike probably 25 or 30 years ago, is that everything you say is being recorded.

'And, you know, now and then, things don't come out exactly the way you want them to come out.  

'They
don't sound the way you thought they sounded. And now, with a good 
opposition campaign, they grab it, they blow it up, maybe they take it a
bit out of context, maybe they don't, but it obviously is paraded in a 
way that you hadn't intended.

'But that's just the nature of politics today.  You have to get over it and live with it.'

During the interview, it also emerged that Ann took the defeat the hardest, because she 'truly felt' her husband would win.

Ms Borger asked her: 'Well, was it harder for you because you thought you were going to win?

Ann replied: 'I think so. I think Mitt was more balanced about the whole thing. He's always very rational about everything.

'And he was saying how close this election was going to be and it was a difficult race and, you know, that it -- and he was -- he was always saying that.

'And I said, "oh, don't worry about it, you're going to win". On the campaign trail, I'd see people and they'd be so intensely, you know, concerned about the country and everything, don't worry, we're going to win.

'And I felt that. I really truly felt that we were going to win.

'And so I'm glad, as I look back, that I felt that way, because it's the way I had to feel, because I believed in it.  I believed in Mitt.  I believed in what we were doing.

'For me, I had to believe we were going to win, as well, for it to be OK for me to even go through what we had to go through.'

After being under the media spotlight every day for two years while they ran for the White House, the couple revealed how different life was now for them.

And it threw up a few surprise with Ann admitting her husband is proving to be very domesticated.

She said: 'Mitt's helping a lot. I mean you can't believe how helpful he's been in the kitchen, washing dishes, going to the grocery store.  He's even doing laundry.'

During the interview, Mitt admitted that dealing with mistakes was the difficult challenge following the campaign.

As well as admitting regret over the 
47 per cent remark, he admitted not doing enough at connecting with 
minority voters and getting more support from minority families.

During the interview Ann also revealed she would not want her sons to run for public office.

She
said: I think it's a huge sacrifice and I think it is very hurtful many
times for the spouse to have to watch the kind of abuse that you know 
you have to go through so I'd really have to measure that and think 
about it and think about the individual circumstance.'

When asked directly about the talk of Tagg running for the Senate, she replied: ' I would say don't do it to Tagg, I would'.
