Doreen Mannion, who died after falling down stairs and waiting two-and-a-half hours for an ambulance, is seen here in her heyday as a ballerina in the 1940s

A former ballerina who fell down stairs and broke her leg died after waiting almost two-and-a-half hours for an ambulance, an inquest heard.

Doreen Mannion, 85, who had performed with the Sadler’s Wells dance company, was left in agony after the fall at her home last year.

But she was not deemed a ‘priority’ by 999 call handlers and was left on a cold floor for two hours and 23 minutes before paramedics eventually arrived.

The widow was treated for her fracture but lapsed into a coma and died two months later.

An inquest heard the sprightly pensioner, who had done ballet exercises well into her 70s, fell backwards as she went upstairs to bed at her home in Withington, Manchester, in January last year.

Mrs Mannion shouted and banged on the inside of her front door to alert passers-by. Three men heard her cries, forced their way in and called 999.

Her son Richard, 63, a former NHS worker, told the inquest: ‘I received a call around midnight from a man saying, “You don’t know me but I’m in your mother’s house. She has broken her leg.” ’

The mother of two was in pain and they were afraid to move her in case her back was broken, Mr Mannion said.

He told the inquest: ‘The wait didn’t do mother any good. She was on the cold floor and we couldn’t keep her warm. It was the most long and alarming wait … within 24 hours she was in a condition she would not recover from.’

Despite efforts by medical staff the former dance teacher’s condition deteriorated and she lapsed into a coma before developing pneumonia. She died in March last year.

Speaking after the hearing Mr Mannion said: ‘She was of that generation that didn’t complain. She was lying there for around two-and-a-half hours on the cold lino.

‘It’s completely unacceptable really … I believe that leaving her lying on the floor for so long did not help. This was the golden hour and I believe my mother was failed by the ambulance service.

Richard Mannion, seen here with his mother, at his wedding two years ago, told the inquest the wait for an ambulance was 'the most long and alarming wait'

‘She was in a dreadful state and all we could do was wait.’

The family complained to North West Ambulance Service, believing the delayed emergency treatment was a factor in her death.

'In my opinion, she would not have otherwise died in the circumstances in which she did'

But NWAS sector manager Angela Anne Lee, told the inquest Mrs Mannion’s condition was ‘serious but not immediately life-threatening’ and other emergencies had to take priority on the night.

She said that January evening was the busiest of 2013, after New Year’s Eve, with a backlog of ‘grade red’ life-threatening cases, triggered by heavy snowfall causing multiple road accidents and stranding ambulances.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Manchester assistant coroner Graham Jackson said Mrs Mannion’s deterioration was the result of many medical factors, the trigger being the fall.

‘In my opinion, she would not have otherwise died in the circumstances in which she did,’ he said.

A NWAS spokesman said it aims to ensure patients get an appropriate response ‘as quickly as possible’, but that ‘factors which are out of our control … can have an impact on our response and contribute to delays’.
