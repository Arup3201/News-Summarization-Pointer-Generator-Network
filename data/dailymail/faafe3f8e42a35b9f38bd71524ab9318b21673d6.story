One of Britain's youngest Conservative councillors has been slammed for a series of Facebook photos that show her swigging from a champagne bottle and partying in a bikini.

Oxbridge graduate Jodie Jones, 23, is also pictured in provocative clinches with female friends and sat drunkenly in the street clutching balloons and bottles of alcohol.

Her colleagues at Cannock Chase District Council in Staffordshire, to which she was elected earlier this year, have warned her that her lifestyle could get her in trouble in the council chamber.

Labour councillor Diane Todd said: 'These pictures do not show the behaviour she should be displaying.

'That's not the behaviour I expect of a councillor. She needs to make sure that she isn't seen sat swigging from bottles like this.'

Fellow Labour member Christine Mitchell added: 'We all know what young people do.

'I'm sure if you go out on a Saturday you'll find the older councillors inebriated as well, but she has signed up to a code of conduct.

'She must make sure that she doesn't do anything or say anything that might bring the council into disrepute.'

Miss Jones graduated from Oxford University in 2009 with a degree in Politics and History.

She is now working in the office of Cannock's MP Aidan Burley.

She has staunchly defended her photos and said that her days of partying are now well behind her.

She said: 'I hardly have any time for a social life these days.

'The election definitely took its toll.

'A few friends fell out with me completely because I couldn't make it to parties and events I was expected to attend.

'It offended a few people that the politics had to come first.

'I just couldn't be around for them as much as before.

'I don't have any time for a boyfriend, I will probably be able to one day, but for now I have enough responsibilities with my job.

'I still go out with my friends when I can.

'We go out for a few drinks and a laugh but I have to be careful with what I say and who I'm talking to these days.'

And despite the furore about her Facebook profile, she said she was still keen to one day follow her boss to Westminster and even possibly take the top job.

She said: 'I definitely see myself in Parliament one day, and who knows what might happen, I won't rule anything out. I could be Prime Minister one day.'
