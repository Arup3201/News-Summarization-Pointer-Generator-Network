A 15-year-old schoolboy who allegedly set up a cocaine dealing operation at his secondary school has been questioned by police.

Officers received a tip-off that the teenager was dealing the lethal Class A drug in the playground of Poole High School in Dorset at lunchtime on Monday.

He was led away in handcuffs in front of stunned classmates after being arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs and has since been bailed.

Headteacher Fan Heafield said: 'We were informed that a student had brought a quantity of drugs into school.

'We immediately called the police and they subsequently arrested a student.

'We are cooperating fully with the police in their ongoing inquiry. The school will always take immediate and strongest action possible in relation to any incident involving drugs.

'As this is a police matter we have no further comment to make at this time.' 

A spokesman for Dorset Police said: 'We had a call at 12.05pm with reports that it was suspected that a student may be in possession of drugs.

'A 15-year-old boy from Poole was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. He has been bailed until early April pending further inquiries.'

More than 1,700 boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 study at Poole High School, which is one of the biggest secondary schools in the county.

It is a specialist Business and Enterprise College and was rated 'Good' in 2011 by Ofsted inspectors, who singled out students' good behaviour for praise.

According to school policy, anyone found in possession of illegal drugs risks immediate expulsion.

Poole Town ward councillor Chris Wilson said 'I'm not shocked, but I'm disappointed that something like that has happened. I hope it can be sorted.'

She said a working party of councillors had visited Poole High recently to look at their pastoral care and had been quite impressed with the way they looked after the needs of pupils.

Conservative town centre councillor Carol Evans said 'I must say if it's true I'm disappointed.

'It's a caring school and has a strong no drugs policy. I'm sure this is against the ethos of the school.'
