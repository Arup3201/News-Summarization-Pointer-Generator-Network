A devastated mother-of-two is suing the NHS after doctors misdiagnosed a spinal condition which left her disabled - when she sneezed.

Debbie Thomason, 35, claims she suffered permanent damage when doctors mistook cauda equina syndrome - a serious spinal condition - for another back condition.

She already suffered from the nerve condition sciatica, but had to be rushed to hospital in May 2011 after she sneezed and collapsed in excruciating pain at her Northampton home.

Debbie Thomason is suing the NHS after bungling doctors misdiagnosed a spinal condition which left her disabled when she sneezed

Doctors at Northampton General Hospital failed to detect that nerves at the base of her spine had compressed as a result of her sneeze and she had developed cauda equine syndrome.

The condition, which is triggered by the narrowing of the spinal canal, causes nerve roots to compress below the level of the spinal cord. This requires patients to undergo urgent surgery or risk paralysis.

But delayed operating on Mrs Thomason's spine for eight days and despite two further operations when doctors finally diagnosed her condition, she can now only walk a few yards and has been left virtually housebound.

She is now suing the hospital for clinical negligence, claiming her debilitating condition should have been picked up much earlier than it was.

Mrs Thomason, who has had to give up her job as a foster mother as a result of her condition, said: 'I am absolutely distraught.

'My life has been completely shattered by the permanent damage to my spine, which I believe could have been prevented if I had received the care I urgently needed.

'I had had sciatica at the time but nothing like this. It was basically caused by a simple sneeze as I was coming out of my bathroom.

'I never dreamed it could lead to being disabled. I feel so angry that this has happened and that nothing can be done for me.

'By taking legal action I hope to highlight my case to the trust and help to save other people from going through what I have. 

'While it is too late for me, it may not be for someone else.'

Her husband Darren, 37, has had to give up his job as a bricklayer to become a full-time foster parent and look after the couple's children Jamie, 15, and Bethany, 12.

He is also a full time carer to Debbie who cannot bathe of dress herself and needs assistance going to the toilet.

Mr Thomason said: 'It is so sad what has happened. Debbie loved nothing more than taking the kids out to the park and playing games and we also really enjoyed our family holidays.

'Now we can't even go out. She is pretty much permanently bed-ridden and in constant pain. It is so upsetting to see. 

'She did have sciatica, but it was just nothing more than mild back ache. It was undoubtedly the sneeze which caused this.

'It was a powerful sneeze and she was left on her hand and knees in agony. 

'But we believe there were unacceptable delays after her condition was not spotted and this has resulted in her current predicament.'

Mrs Thomason's solicitors claim that eventual surgery - and two further operations - was of a poor standard which has contributed to her constant pain

The couple's solicitors also claim that eventual surgery - and two further operations - was of a poor standard which has contributed to her constant pain.

Eddie Jones, clinical negligence lawyer at solicitors JMW, said: 'Debbie is now disabled at the age of 35 and has gone from being an independent woman, used to spending her days caring for others, to someone who needs care herself.

'Cauda equina syndrome has devastated her life, but the tragedy is that it doesn't have to cause such significant disability and can be treated effectively with urgent surgery.'

Northampton General Hospital said it was unable to comment due to the ongoing legal process.
