Rocker: Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground were part of 1960s New York's thriving artistic scene

Reed died in Southampton, New York of an ailment related to his recent liver transplant, according to his literary agent, Andrew Wylie, who added that Reed had been in frail health for months. Reed shared a home in Southampton with his wife and fellow musician, Laurie Anderson, whom he married in 2008.

The punk, New Wave and alternative rock
 movements of the 1970s, `80s and `90s were all indebted to Reed, whose 
songs were covered by R.E.M., Nirvana, Patti Smith and countless others.

Many celebrities, both fans and friends, took to Twitter to express their grief at Reed's passing.

Okkervil River tweeted, 'Lou Reed might have been the single biggest influence on my music and his encouragement changed my life. I'm devastated.'

Born Lewis Allan Reed in Brooklyn, New
 York in 1942, Lou Reed grew up in Freeport, Long Island.

He developed an ear for rhythm and blues, forming 
several bands while still in high school after teaching himself to play 
guitar simply by listening to the radio.

Reed was one of rock's archetypal tough guys, but he grew up middle class - an accountant's son raised on Long Island. Reed was born to be a suburban dropout. He hated school, loved rock n' roll, fought with his parents and attacked them in song for forcing him to undergo electroshock therapy as a supposed 'cure' for being bisexual.

'Families that live out in the suburbs often make each other cry,' he later wrote.

Reed introduced avant garde rock to mainstream music and has been credited as having a significant impact on American culture.

He never approached the commercial success of such superstars as the Beatles and Bob Dylan, but no songwriter to emerge after Dylan so radically expanded the territory of rock lyrics.

And no band did more than the Velvet Underground to open rock music to the avant-garde - to experimental theater, art, literature and film, to William Burroughs and Kurt Weill, to John Cage and Andy Warhol, Reed's early patron.

Warhol
 incorporated the Velvet Underground's music into his Exploding Plastic 
Inevitable multimedia events, with Reed revealing that Andy would 'show 
his movies on us'.

'We wore black so you could see the movie. But we were all wearing black anyway,' he explained.

Honored: The Velvet Underground was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 by Patti Smith

'I
 was just writing down everything that was going on around me,' he says 
of his songwriting process during that period. 'And look where I was - I
 was next to the greatest artist of the 20th century. Not that I knew 
that at the time.'

The Velvet Underground was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 1996.

'I
 always thought we were easily the most sophisticated, articulate group 
in the world,' Reed stated. 'We didn't get to keep going because of 
strife. But there was no one near us - to this day.

'If
 you look note by note, word by word, subject by subject, my idea was 
essentially: What would happen if you had the lyrics of Tennessee 
Williams or William Burroughs and you put it in a rock context? That was
 my idea, and I was trying to write up to that.'

As a songwriter, Reed broke new ground by 
writing songs about taboo subjects as S&M, transvestites and 
transsexuals, prostitution, and drug addiction.

Following his departure from The Velvet Underground in 1970, Reed began a solo career that would span several decades.

He
 collaborated with many artists over the course of his career, including
 David Bowie, Antony and the Johnsons and Kate McGarrigle.'

Reviewing Reed's 1989 topical album 'New York,' Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote that 'the pleasure of the lyrics is mostly tone and delivery - plus the impulse they validate, their affirmation that you can write songs about this stuff. Protesting, elegizing, carping, waxing sarcastic, forcing jokes, stating facts, garbling what he just read in the Times, free-associating to doomsday, Lou carries on a New York conversation - all that's missing is a disquisition on real estate.'

Reed's New York was a jaded city of drag queens, drug addicts and violence, but it was also as wondrous as any Allen comedy, with so many of Reed's songs explorations of right and wrong and quests for transcendence.

As frontman of the Velvet Underground and a prolific solo artist, Lou Reed was an inspirational musician and lyricist to generations. Many of his albums are essential listening.

The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967) - The debut album by The Velvet Underground and vocal collaborator Nico is one of the most critically acclaimed rock records ever. It includes celebrated songs such as Sunday Morning, All Tomorrow's Parties and I'm Waiting For The Man.

The Velvet Underground (1969) - After the more experimental White Light/White Heat record (1968), The Velvet Underground returned to a more straight forward and melodic style. This record includes songs such as Candy Says, Beginning To See The Light, Pale Blue Eyes and What Goes On.

Transformer (1972) - This is Reed's second solo album after recording only four records with the The Velvet Underground. Transformer includes well-loved hits such as Perfect Day, Walk On The Wild Side and Satellite Of Love.

As a solo artist Reed released 22 studio albums, 12 live albums, 15 compilation albums and 44 singles.

He lived many lives in the `70s, initially moving back home and working at his father's office, then competing with Keith Richards as the rock star most likely to die. He binged on drugs and alcohol, gained weight, lost even more and was described by critic Lester Bangs as 'so transcendently emaciated he had indeed become insectival.'

Reed simulated shooting heroin during concerts, cursed out journalists and once slugged David Bowie when Bowie suggested he clean up his life.

An outlaw in his early years, Reed would eventually perform at the White House, have his writing published in The New Yorker, be featured by PBS in an 'American Masters' documentary and win a Grammy in 1999 for Best Long Form Music Video. The Velvet Underground was inducted into the Rock and Roll of Fame in 1996 and their landmark debut album, 'The Velvet Underground & Nico,' was added to the Library of Congress' registry in 2006.

Though
 he is said to have been uninspired by the current state of the music 
industry and lack of talented stars, one person that he did admire was, 
perhaps surprisingly, Kanye West.

Final message: Lou Reed was active on Twitter this morning, posting this picture to his account with the caption, 'The door.'

'The
 only person who's out there really doing something is Kanye West. This 
guy is really serious, trying to do something,' he said. 'This new album
 of his is hard to believe. It's incredible - the mixture of genres, the
 melodies, the sounds. He's really good, whatever you might think of him
 on other levels. And he's also very, very funny.'

He remained an avid and interesting artist, branching out into photography and released two book of his work, 'Emotions in Action' and 'Lou Reed's New York.'

Reed interacted with fans regularly, with a Facebook page and a Twitter account with more than 42,000 followers. His last Tweet was posted this morning, a picture of a door with a Lou Reed poster on it.

He remained active in his solo career, and interactive with his fans until the last day. His Twitter account, with over 42,000 followers, was frequently updated. Reed's last tweet was posted Sunday morning.

It said only 'The Door' and posted a Facebook link to a picture of him on a closed door.

Reid is survived by his wife, Laurie Anderson.
