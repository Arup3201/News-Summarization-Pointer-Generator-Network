These incredible images show the world’s genetically-engineered pink fluorescent fish as they are unveiled at an exhibition in Taipei.

The fish, latin name Archocentrus nigrofasciatus var, glow brightly without the aid of ultraviolet lamps commonly placed in fish tanks.

They were created by a joint project between Taiwan’s Academia Sinica, National Taiwan Ocean University and Jy Lin, a private biotechnology company.

Scientific marvel: The genetically-engineered angelfish, the first of their type in the world, glow in a tank during a news conference before the 2012 Taiwan International Aquarium Expo in Taipei

They were unveiled at a news conference for the 2012 Taiwan International Aquarium Expo, to be held at Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall from tomorrow.

When light is produced by an organism using a chemical reaction it is called bioluminescence and it most commonly occurs in sea creatures.

The dazzling glow-in-the-dark display can be used for communication, to attract prey and to distract predators.

Still spectacular: This stock picture shows regular angelfish, or pterophyllum. They originate from tropical South America

Angelfish, or pterophyllum, are freshwater fish from the family Cichlidae. All angelfish species originate from the Amazon River, Orinoco River and Essequibo River basins in tropical South America. There are 11 different species.
