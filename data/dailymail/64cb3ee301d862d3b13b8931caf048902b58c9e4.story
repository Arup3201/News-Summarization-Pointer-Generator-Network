Jurgen 
Klinsmann has made many improvements to the USA national team since 
taking over as head coach in 2011. One of  his first moves, though, may resonate with football supporters in England who suspect our national 
footballers are handled too gingerly.

‘Like
 most teams, we had a player liaison officer on board,’ said a source 
close to the USA set-up on Wednesday.

‘They used to look after the players’
 needs, get them tickets for things, organise travel and things like 
that. Jurgen didn’t see the point of it. His view was the players were 
grown men and they should be able to look after themselves. He found 
another job for her.’

On Thursday in Recife, he heads into the most intriguing match of his World Cup so 
far. On Brazil’s north-east coast, Klinsmann’s talented USA team face 
Germany in Group G.

Germany, of course, are managed by Joachim Low, Klinsmann’s friend and the man who served as his assistant when Klinsmann managed his home country in their own World Cup eight years ago.

A draw will ensure both teams go through to the next stage, leaving Portugal and Ghana to fly home.

Not surprisingly, conspiracy theories abound. Even the taxi driver taking journalists to the airport in Natal yesterday expressed the view that a cosy draw was in the offing. Klinsmann, for his part, has simply said the right things.

‘There is no time for friendship calls to Jogi,’ Klinsmann said. ‘This is all about business now. There will be no such call. In three weeks from now we will be back on the phone and talk about it and visit each other’s families. But we want to make the life of Germans more difficult, we want to beat them.’

Eyes will be focused particularly keenly
 on today’s game at Arena  Pernambuco partly because of an uncomfortable
 piece of history. At the 1982 World Cup in Spain, West Germany faced 
Austria in their final group game in Gijon knowing that a 1-0 victory 
would take them through to the next stage and prove a narrow enough 
defeat for the Austrians to accompany them at Algeria’s expense.

West
 Germany won 1-0 and the game became known as the ‘Shame of Gijon’ with 
Algeria furious at the perceived lack of effort from both teams 
following an early goal.

Klinsmann said: ‘You are talking about a 
game that happened decades ago. It is part of German history, not United
 States history. If you look at our history, we make things happen.

‘If we didn’t, then Mexico wouldn’t be at this World Cup because we beat Panama to help them qualify.

‘We
 have that fighting spirit and determination to do well in every game. 
We want to go at Germany, win the game and be in the driving seat for 
the next round. The Portugal performance shows how far we have made it 
already.

‘We have one foot in the door of the second round. We just need to put the second foot in there now.’
