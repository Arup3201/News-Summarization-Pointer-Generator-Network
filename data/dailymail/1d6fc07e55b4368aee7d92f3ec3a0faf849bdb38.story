On trial: Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, seen in 2011, is on trial for the murder of 16 Afghans slain in the early hours of March 11

Army prosecutors say the U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a murderous rampage must face the death penalty for his 'heinous and despicable crimes'.

Attorneys asked the investigative officer overseeing a preliminary hearing to recommend a death penalty court-martial for Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, as they made their closing arguments at the end of a week of testimony.

Bales, 39, is accused of slipping away from his remote base at Camp Belambay in southern Afghanistan to attack two villages early on March 11 - nine children were among the dead.

The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan, and it was three weeks before American investigators could reach the crime scenes.

'Terrible, terrible things happened,' said prosecutor Major Rob Stelle. 'That is clear.'

Maj. Stelle cited statements Bales made after he was apprehended, saying that they demonstrated 'a clear memory of what he had done, and consciousness of wrong-doing'.

Several soldiers testified that Bales returned to the base alone just before dawn, covered in blood, and that he made incriminating statements such as, 'I thought I was doing the right thing'.

An attorney for Bales argued that there was not enough information to move forward with the court-martial.

'There are a number of questions that have not been answered so far in this investigation,' attorney Emma Scanlan told the investigating officer overseeing the preliminary hearing.

Scanlan said that it is still unknown what Bales' state of mind was the evening of the killings.

An Army criminal investigations command special agent had testified last week that Bales tested positive for steroids three days after the killings, and other soldiers testified that Bales had been drinking the evening of the massacre.

'We've heard that Sgt. Bales was lucid, coherent and responsive,' Scanlan said in her closing argument.

'We don't know what it means to be on alcohol, steroids and sleeping aids,' she added.

The investigating officer said at 
Tuesday's hearing that he would have a written recommendation by the end
of the week, but that is just the start of the process.

'Terrible, terrible things happened. That is clear'

That recommendation goes next to the 
brigade command, and the ultimate decision would be made by the 
three-star general on the base.

There's no clear sense of how long that could take before a decision is reached on whether to proceed to a court-martial trial.

If a court-martial takes place, it 
will be held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the Washington state base 
south of Seattle, and witnesses will be flown in from Afghanistan.

The military hasn't executed a service
member since 1961, and none of the six men on death row at Fort 
Leavenworth, Kansas, today were convicted for atrocities against foreign 
civilians. All of their crimes involved the killing of U.S. civilians or
fellow service members.

In the most recent high-profile case 
at Joint Base Lewis-McChord before Bales, the Army did not seek a death 
penalty court-martial against five soldiers accused of killing three 
Afghan civilians for sport. In that case, the ringleader was sentenced 
to life in prison with possibility of parole.

Bales faces 16 counts of premeditated 
murder and six counts of attempted murder. The preliminary hearing, 
which began on November 5, included nighttime sessions on Friday, Saturday and 
Sunday for the convenience of the Afghan witnesses. Bales did not 
testify.

Emma Scanlan, defence attorney for Bales, has said there is insufficient information to move foward with a death penalty court-martial

The witnesses included a seven-year-old 
girl, who described how she hid behind her father when a gunman came to 
their village that night, how the stranger fired, and how her father 
died, cursing in pain and anger.

None of the Afghan witnesses were able
to identify Bales as the shooter, but other evidence, including tests 
of the blood on his clothes, implicated him, according to testimony from
a DNA expert.

After the hearing concluded, Scanlan 
spoke with reporters, saying that in addition to questions about Bales' 
state of mind, there are still questions of whether there were more 
people involved.

'We all grieve deeply for the Afghani families who lost their loved ones...but we must all not rush to judgement'

Statement from Staff Sgt. Bales' family

Scanlan also raised the issue of 
post-traumatic stress disorder and brain injury, noting that Bales had 
received a screening at the traumatic brain injury clinic at Madigan 
Army Medical Center during a period of time that the center is under 
investigation for reversing hundreds of PTSD diagnoses of soldiers since
2007.

'We're in the process of investigating that,' she said.

The attorney refused to confirm if Bales had ever been diagnosed with PTSD.

Bales' wife, Kari, and her sister, 
Stephanie Tandberg, met with reporters briefly after the hearings 
concluded.

Ms Tandberg read a statement, saying 'we all grieve deeply for 
the Afghani families who lost their loved ones on March 11, but we must 
all not rush to judgment'.

Last week, the lead prosecutor, Lt. 
Col. Jay Morse, said on the night of the killings Bales watched a movie 
about a former CIA agent on a revenge killing spree, with two fellow 
soldiers, while drinking contraband whiskey. Morse said Bales first 
attacked one village, Alkozai, returned to the base at Camp Belambay, 
then headed out again to attack a second village, Najiban.

Bales 
returned to the base covered in blood, Morse said, and his incriminating
statements indicate he was 'deliberate and methodical'.

In the family statement, Ms Tandberg 
said: 'We all want very much to know how, why, and what happened ... 
Much of the testimony was painful, even heartbreaking, but we are not 
convinced the government has shown us the truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth about what happened that night ... We know Bob as 
bright, courageous and honorable, as a man who is a good citizen, 
soldier, son, husband, father, uncle and sibling.

'We in Bob's family are
proud to stand by him.'

Survivor: Sadiquallah, a young boy of about 13 or 14, is sketched left at an earlier hearing during his testimony against Bales, right, after surviving the attack despite a bullet grazing his skull

Home invasion: Sadiquallah's father, Haji Naim, was the first to be shot in his home, testifying how he saw the shooter climb over a wall with a light on his head before firing

The
stories recounted by the villagers during testimony have been harrowing. They described 
torched bodies, a son finding his wounded father, and boys cowering 
behind a curtain while others screamed 'We are children! We are 
children!'

One girl, Robina, who was shot in the leg, told how she hid behind her father when the gunman came to her village, and how her father died as shots were fired.

Bales sat 
quietly throughout, betraying no reaction to what he heard. Robina's 
friend, Zardana, now eight, also testified, but only briefly to describe
what the shooter was wearing.

Zardana
suffered a gunshot wound to the top of her head, and when she arrived 
at a nearby military base, the doctors focused on treating the other 
injured victims first. They figured Zardana had no chance of surviving.

After two months at a military 
hospital in Afghanistan and three more at a Navy hospital in San Diego, 
she can walk and talk again.

The 
Afghan witnesses recounted the villagers who lived in the attacked 
compounds and listed the names of those killed, to provide a record of 
the lives lost.

The bodies were buried quickly under Islamic custom, and no forensic evidence was available to prove the number of victims.

The military courtroom on Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington, U.S., where the preliminary hearing was held

Sadiquallah,
a slight boy of about 13 or 14 whose head rose just above his chair at 
the witness table, described being awakened by a neighbor screaming that
an American had 'killed our men'.

He said he and another boy, Zardana's
brother, ran to hide in a storage room and ducked behind a curtain. It 
provided no protection from the bullet that grazed his head and 
fractured his skull. Sadiquallah said the shooter had a gun and a light,
but he could not identify the man.

The other child was hit in the thigh 
and also survived. That boy, Rafiullah, testified on Saturday that an 
American had attacked them and put a gun in his sister's mouth.

His
father, Samiullah, was away when the shootings occurred, and testified 
that by the time he returned the next morning, his two wounded children 
had been driven to a base for treatment. He found his mother among the 
four corpses at the compound.

'I just saw her, I cried, and I could not look on her face,' he said.

Prosecutors
said that in between his attacks, Bales woke a fellow soldier, reported
what he'd done and said he was headed out to kill more. The soldier 
testified that he didn't believe what Bales said, and went back to 
sleep.

During 
cross-examination of several witnesses at the hearing, Bales' attorney, John 
Henry Browne, sought to elicit testimony about whether there might have 
been more than one shooter.

One
Army Criminal Investigations Command special agent testified that 
several months after the massacre, she took a statement from one woman 
whose husband was killed.

The
woman reported that there were two soldiers in her room - one took her 
husband out of the room and shot him, and the other held her back when 
she tried to follow.

But 
other eyewitnesses reported that there was just one shooter, and several
soldiers have testified that Bales returned to his base at Camp 
Belambay, just before dawn, alone and covered in blood.

A video taken from a surveillance blimp also captured a sole figure returning to the base.
