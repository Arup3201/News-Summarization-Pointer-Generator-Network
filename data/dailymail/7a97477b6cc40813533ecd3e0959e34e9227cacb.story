His fellow ministers were wrestling with the Ukraine plane crash crisis and the escalating violence in the Middle East.

But Nick Clegg left the worries of the world behind yesterday – to spend three hours baking and drinking shots of tequila on daytime television.

As the Cobra emergency committee met to discuss Flight MH17, the Deputy Prime Minister was on Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch with minor celebrities including Millie Mackintosh of reality show Made In Chelsea and X Factor contestant Cher Lloyd.

Down it goes: The
 Deputy Prime Minister was criticised for appearing on the show while 
British victims of the missile attack in Ukraine have yet to be 
recovered

He was treated to a tequila tasting, 
in which he sipped three varieties of the fiery Mexican spirit well 
before lunchtime, pronouncing one to be ‘very smooth’ and another 
‘peppery’.

In another 
segment, the Lib Dem leader was taught how to make an avocado cake, and 
discussed his free school meals policy while mixing and whisking the 
ingredients in a bowl.

This
 was followed up with more booze – a ‘Commonwealth cocktail’ of 
ingredients from 71 countries, which Mr Clegg said was ‘not bad at all’.

He also named his 
favourite vinegar – balsamic – and shared a tray of empanada, a Spanish 
speciality cooked by his wife Miriam and carrying the words ‘Sunday 
Brunch’ in dough.

Miriam had done most of the work, he said, adding: ‘I assisted throughout. I brushed the thing with egg and chopped and diced.’

But
 his efforts were deemed ‘ridiculous’ by Lib Dem activist Charlotte 
Henry, who wrote a blog entitled: ‘As the world burned, Nick Clegg 
cooked.’

On Saturday the Deputy PM tweeted a picture of himself with an empanada with 'Sunday Brunch' baked in

Tory and 
Labour MPs expressed surprise that Mr Clegg, a member of the National 
Security Council, was able to devote so much time to the show.

Labour MP Grahame 
Morris said: 'Nick Clegg displays an alarmingly cavalier indifference 
given the seriousness of the situation. He is supposed to be Deputy 
Prime Minister, not a contestant on Master Chef.'

John Mann added: 'It 
sums up Clegg's priorities.'

The appearance came as David Cameron held crisis talks with world 
leaders over the crisis in Ukraine.

The
 Prime Minister spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the 
French President Francois Hollande, before the Foreign Secretary Philip 
Hammond held an emergency meeting of the Government's Cobra committee at
 1pm.

But
 Mr Clegg, attempting to boost his poll ratings as the party heads for 
disaster in the next general election in May, spent the morning on TV.

Mr
 Clegg's aides defended his decision to appear on the show. A spokesman 
said it was a long-standing commitment and that he did not miss any 
meetings on the crisis.

The
 programme, which Mr Clegg’s spokesman said had more than a million 
viewers, changed the format for its high-profile guest by interviewing 
him about why he went into politics and how his party had fared in 
coalition.

Asked about Flight MH17, he said it was ‘just heart-breaking’ and offered his condolences to the families of the victims.

He also said he was always on duty and that ‘with modern technology … people can always reach you’.

The Deputy PM was able to speak to an audience which does not usually watch politics shows

His
 spokesman said the Cobra meeting was just for the Foreign Secretary and
 officials, not other ministers, but Mr Clegg had been briefed on it.

Asked about the weekly sessions of Prime 
Minister's Questions, Mr Clegg said: 'I think the whole thing has become
 a complete farce.'

He added: 'It might have had its time once but this is a place where you can't call people by their name, you have to call them "right honourable blah blah blah" or if they have a legal background you have to say "right honourable, learned", if they are actually in the Army it's even worse, you have to say 'right honourable, learned, gallant".

'It's just people... shouting at each other, it's a very concentrated, gladiator, sort of spectacle.

'There are some people who might like it, my own view is most normal people - and most normal people don't follow the ins and outs of politics - find the whole thing totally off-putting.

'This is a place, Westminster, where some of the pomp and ceremony is all right but some of it is just so out of date. This is a place which had a 19th-century shooting gallery but didn't have a creche until quite recently.

'That tells you everything you need to know about a place that is still, by my view, far too stuck in the past.'

Defending the decision to form the coalition, he said: 'You can, if you want, stand on the sidelines and throw stones and feel completely pure and you never have to take a difficult decision, you never have to face a difficult dilemma.

'I actually think if I had done that, if my party had done that, actually you would think "are we ever going to step up to the plate or not?"

'I personally think the history books will look back and realise that back then, back in 2010 after those debates and everything, people had to step up to the plate because we needed to clear stuff up.'

Mr Clegg has faced a barrage of criticism, and his party has suffered in local and European elections, since 2010.

Mr Clegg used the show to attack Prime Minister's Questions and share his sympathy with the victims of the MH17 missile attack

The Lib Dem leader said: 'Politics at the end of the day is about the marriage of your ideals, which you have got to hold on to, but also practicality. Sometimes, frankly, they don't fit perfectly well together."

Asked if he had been ready for the attacks he faced in Government, Mr Clegg said: 'It's like any job. You can't prepare for it completely until you start, until you actually do it.

'I absolutely knew that if the Liberal Democrats, for the first time in their history, either went in with Labour or the Conservatives you would really annoy a whole bunch of other people, by definition, because you have got this very polarised, pendulum swing politics - it's either the red team or the blue team and suddenly you've messed it up by the yellow team getting in there as well.

'Did I really imagine some of it would be quite as vitriolic? Perhaps not, but you can't spend all your life answering back to people who just want to insult you, you have just got to get on with the job, and that's what I try to do.'
