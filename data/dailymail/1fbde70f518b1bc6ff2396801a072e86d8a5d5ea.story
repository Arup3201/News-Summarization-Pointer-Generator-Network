A woman whose stomach was so swollen she thought she was pregnant has told of her horror after discovering she was carrying a 5st ovarian cyst.

Lorna Fulton, 44, desperately wanted a family but was left heartbroken when doctors told her, and her husband Stewart, they were unlikely to conceive naturally.

Mrs Fulton, from Glasgow, tipped the scales at 21st and wore size 24 dresses.

But she refused IVF treatment and instead threw herself into slimming to a healthier weight in the hope of conceiving.

However, in August last year Mrs Fulton was baffled when she struggled to even fit into a bigger size 26 and her waistline continued to expand despite months of dieting and losing 2st.

She rushed to her GP hoping her growing bump was a miracle baby, but after a pregnancy test came back negative she was referred to specialists who discovered a huge ovarian cyst.

She said: ‘Stewart and I had almost given up hope of having children, but when our doctor suggested IVF, we decided not to go down that route and hoped it would happen on its own.

‘At 21st I knew I had to do something about my weight to help my chances.

‘So, I joined a diet class and started eating a healthier diet and within a few months I'd lost 2st.

During surgery to remove the cyst, Mrs Fulton had to have 32 litres of fluid drained from her stomach. She also had to have a hysterectomy. She is pictured after the cyst was removed

‘I went out to buy a new outfit to celebrate. I had been a size 24 so I picked up a size 22, hoping it would now fit comfortably.

‘But I couldn't get into it as around my middle was too big and I had to go up to a size 26.

‘It was so noticeable that people at work thought I was pregnant and kept asking when I was due.

‘So I went to see my GP, who was convinced at first I was pregnant.

An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman's ovary.

They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms.

In most cases, they are harmless and usually disappear without the need for treatment.

However, if the cyst is large or causing symptoms, it may need to be surgically removed.

An ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it ruptures, is very large, or if it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries.

In this case, symptoms can include pelvic pain, urinating frequently, a change to menstruation, bloating and tiredness.

‘But when a pregnancy test proved negative I knew there was something more sinister lurking.

‘I was referred to hospital where I had a biopsy, a CT scan and an ultra sound.

‘Finally a specialist told me that I had a huge ovarian cyst, which from the scan they could see was filled with fluid.

‘They told me if I didn't have it removed I could die.’

Devastated, Mrs Fulton was forced to undergo a full hysterectomy at Glasgow's Royal Infirmary where medics drained more than 32 litres of fluid from her stomach.

She said: ‘At the hospital, I had to have my operation in the maternity unit.

‘It was horrible. I was really sad, but I knew I just had to deal with the fact I wouldn't be having children.

‘I knew what was involved in the operation, but I just wanted it gone.’

Mrs Fulton shed more than 5st overnight after the growth was successfully removed.

She said: ‘The doctors said it was too risky to remove it whole so it had to be drained. ‘Plus, there was a chance it could come back in my other ovary so I finally consented to a full hysterectomy.

‘I went under the knife and said goodbye to having children once and for all.

‘The doctor drained 32 litres of fluid and removed the lump.

‘Waking up from the op, I felt much better and the following day weighed myself.

‘At that point I'd been 19st and after having the lump removed I was now down to 14st.

‘It was unbelievable I'd been carrying around all that weight.

‘I've now accepted that children are not on the cards for me.

‘But things could have been so much worse. I'm lucky to be alive.’
