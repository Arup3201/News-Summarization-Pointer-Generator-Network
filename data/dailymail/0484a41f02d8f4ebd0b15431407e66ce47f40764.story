After the disastrous mid-term elections for President Barack Obama and the Democratic party, the commander in chief could be in dire need of a way to 'shake off' his party's failure at the polls.

The answer could be in this hilarious mash-up song which debuted on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday.

In the clever clip, a speech by President Obama is woven into Taylor Swift's popular hit song 'Shake it off' and it sounds as though Obama is doing the back up vocals for the track.

 Shake it off: Could this mash-up song featuring Taylor Swift, left and President Obama, right, help the defeat?

Popular: Swift is enjoying a surge in popularity after her new album 1989 notched up the biggest sales week of the last 12 years

The segment uses a part of Obama's speech where he repeats the word 'vote' numerous times in an effort to galvanize his supporters.

However, the song won't allow the President to shake off the fact that the Republicans consolidated their power on Capitol Hill, picking up more seats than they needed to gain control of the Senate.

Last night's results will leave President Obama a lame duck for the last two years of his presidency.

Yet, unlike the Democrats, pop star Swift is enjoying a surge in popularity after her new album 1989 notched up the biggest sales week of the last 12 years. 

Pressure: This pairing could be the start of a burgeoning new start for the Democrats after they were defeated at the ballot box
