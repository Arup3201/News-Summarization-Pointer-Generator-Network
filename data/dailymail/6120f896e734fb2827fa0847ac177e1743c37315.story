A pregnant woman went into labor early and her young children were rushed to hospital after accidentally eating LSD in steak bought from a Florida WalMart.

Jessica Rosado had to have her labor induced on Monday night after the 31-year-old and her family fell ill and started hallucinating after dinner.

The WalMart store that supplied the bottom round steak has turned over all its meat for testing as police begin an investigation.Â

Investigation: The Florida branch of WalMart where the allegedly contaminated steak was bought is checking surveillance footage for suspicious activity

Ms Rosasdo had been driving her boyfriend, Ronnie Morales, to St Joseph's Hospital when she started to also feel unwell on Monday night.

By the time they reached the hospital her two children, Elyana, 7, and Rayna, 6, had started to hallucinate.

Mr Morales and the children were given emergency treatment, including a tracheal intubation - where a tube is inserted in the windpipe to keep the airways clear.

Ms Rosasdo, who was nine months' pregnant, had her labor induced and later gave birth to a healthy boy. She was able to return home with her son on Thursday.

Tampa police chief Jane Castor said: 'There was no indication that we know of right now that the meat tasted funny.'

'It was the physical symptoms they had, which included hallucinations, dizziness, rapid heart rate and difficulty breathing.'

She added: 'The family has no idea where this may have come from and there's no indication of any involvement on the part of the family.'

Dinner shock: The family fell ill after eating steak that appears to have been laced with LSD

Ms Rosado had been cooking dinner for the first time in the couple's new home, which they had moved into two days earlier.

Tampa police say the family bought the steak from a WalMart on North Dale Mabry Highway. The store has co-operated with the investigation and voluntarily handed over remaining meat on its shelves.

It is not yet clear how or when the steak became contaminated. Tests on Friday showed the steak and its packaging had traces of LSD.

The Medical Examiner is currently testing that meat and police say no other cases have been reported so far.

WalMart issued a statement to the Tampa Bay Times, saying it was 'deeply disturbed' by the incident.

'It's unclear where and how the food was tampered with or if the tampering occurred after purchase. However, out of an abundance of caution, we have pulled the remaining product from the store,' a spokesman for the chain said.

'We have been in touch with our supplier and they tell us they have no reports of similar incidents. We are also reviewing our store's surveillance video to see if we can find any information that might assist in the investigation. At this point, we're not aware of any suspicious activity.'

Forensic investigators have taken leftovers from the dinner and the family's oven to test for drugs.

Initial results from Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's Office showed the family had all consumed steak contaminated with LSD.

Toxicology test results from samples taken from the family are expected in three weeks.
