Responsibility: The Met Police should have informed Mark Duggan's family about the fatal shooting, the police complaints watchdog ruled

The Metropolitan Police has apologised to the family of Mark Duggan, whose shooting triggered last summer’s riots, for failing to inform them of his death.

The apology was revealed after the Independent Police Complaints Commission upheld a complaint by the family that neither the Met or the IPCC formally notified them.

Duggan was shot and killed by Metropolitan Police officers on August 4 in Tottenham, north London.

The IPCC is still conducting a separate investigation into the full circumstances of the shooting.

But it also looked into the Duggan family’s complaint that they were not formally notified of his death by either the police or the IPCC.

IPCC commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said today: ‘The investigation is complete and has found that Mr Duggan’s parents were not informed of his death by the Metropolitan Police Service, whose responsibility it was, and I have upheld that complaint.’

The Met’s North Area Commander Mak Chishty said: ‘We recognise that it was the responsibility of the MPS to keep the family informed immediately following the shooting and up until it was handed over to the IPCC family liaison managers.

‘We acknowledge and apologise for the distress caused by not speaking directly to Mark Duggan’s parents Pamela Duggan and Bruno Hall.

‘I met with the family of Mark Duggan on 2 September 2011, and apologised to them directly on behalf of the MPS for the distress caused by officers not attending personally to inform them of their son’s death.’

Ms Cerfontyne also apologised for the way the IPCC dealt with the family.

The Met and the IPCC were criticised in the wake of the shooting over their contact with the Duggan family.

The family lodged a formal complaint about this in September.

Ms Cerfontyne said that a police family liaison officer had spoken to two members of Duggan’s family at the scene and on the night of the shooting.

The officer told the IPCC that he had confirmed to them with ‘99 per cent certainty’ that the man who had been shot by police was Duggan.

Aftermath: Confusion among the police left Mark Duggan's mother 'hoping the worst had not happened', not knowing he had been fatally shot

Tensions: A police family liaison officer had spoken to two members of Duggan's family at the scene and on the night of the shooting

Shock: Officers say relatives spoken to at the scene on Ferry Lane, Tottenham, asked not to inform the Duggan family

The officer said the family members had asked the police not to go to the Duggan family home to formally notify his parents because it would be too much of a shock for them and said that they would do it themselves.

Categorical: Fiancee Semone Wilson told the police watchdog that she did not tell family liaison officers she would inform Mark Duggan's parents 

But Ms Cerfontyne said the two family members, who had introduced themselves as his sister and his partner, ‘are categorical that neither of them told the family liaison officers that the police should not visit Mr Duggan’s parents to tell them the news of his death, nor did they say that they would inform his parents themselves.

‘Indeed, both have said that they left the scene uncertain that the dead man was Mark Duggan, so in their view, they would not have been in a position to deliver such news to his parents.’

The IPCC took over family liaison on Friday August 5 and was told by the MPS that Duggan’s parents did not want direct contact.

Ms Cerfontyne said: ‘In the aftermath of Mr Duggan’s death, his family were very confused and wanted to know what had happened to him.

‘They did not understand the role of the IPCC, nor that the organisation was separate from the police.

‘It
would have greatly assisted them if a senior representative of the IPCC
had visited the family home to introduce the organisation and explain 
its role.

‘With the benefit 
of hindsight, the IPCC should have explored the family’s wishes in more 
depth following the handover from the police family liaison officers, 
and not made the assumption that any wishes that may have been expressed
by the family in relation to the police would automatically extend to 
the IPCC.

‘Mark’s mother 
told us that she was receiving conflicting messages from various people 
in the community and the lack of formal notification allowed her to hope
that the worst had not happened.

Confused: Mark Duggan's family, seen attending his funeral, complained to the IPCC they were not given enough information about the circumstances surrounding his shooting in the immediate aftermath 

‘As she told me: ‘A mother’s worst nightmare is the police coming to your door to tell you that your child is dead. Because this did not happen, I believed the worst had not happened’.’

Ms Cerfontyne went on: ‘What is clear from this case is that a grieving family, suffering from shock, felt badly treated by the police and the IPCC.

‘The MPS has apologised to the family for the way in which Mr Duggan’s parents became aware of his death and I have told them how sorry I am that the IPCC did not provide more support, nor visit them the day after Mr Duggan’s death.’

Tottenham MP David Lammy said: ‘There were serious errors of judgment by both the IPCC and the Met in the days following Mark Duggan’s death.

‘It is any family’s worst nightmare to get a knock on the door telling them that their son or daughter has died. Mark Duggan’s parents weren’t even afforded that courtesy.

‘The IPCC have suffered from a significant credibility gap in Tottenham. They have accepted that they made mistakes - very serious mistakes, given the riots that followed. Now we need to see some significant reforms of the IPCC to make sure this never happens again.’

'Credibility gap': Police relations with local communities have suffered significant damage since the shooting 

Eruption: Two days after Duggan died, the Tottenham riots exploded after his family
spent five frustrating hours seeking a meeting and explanation from 
local police chief

An investigation into the death of Duggan failed to establish the sequence of events concerning a handgun found at the scene.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) looked into the possibility he was carrying the weapon at the time of his death.

A Home Affairs Select Committee study carried out into the cause of the riots later failed to isolate a single factor but found that the death of Duggan was a ‘trigger’.

This led to widespread ‘copycat’ instances as looting spread to other English cities.

The Metropolitan Police have since admitted they did not have enough officers available on the first night of the riots.

They also found that reinforcements took too long to arrive as looting and rioting spread through the capital.

The force later re-examined how it draws intelligence from social media like Twitter and Facebook.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the House of Commons home affairs select committee, said: ‘Families deserve accurate up-to-date information when incidents such as this occur.

‘I welcome the apology by the Metropolitan Police and the thorough report by the IPCC.
