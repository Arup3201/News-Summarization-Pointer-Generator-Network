A bride-to-be and four friends have been seriously injured after a hotel balcony collapsed as they were being shown round the honeymoon suite.

The group were visiting the newly-refurbished bridal suite on the first floor of the Casa Del Lago Hotel, Brighouse, West Yorkshire, with the owner when the horrific accident happened.

All five were standing on the 12ft high decking balcony with glass surround this afternoon when it gave way beneath them.

The scene at the Casa Del Lago hotel in Brighouse, Yorkshire, after the balcony collapsed leaving four women and man, believed to be the owner, with serious injuries

It is understood the four women, including a prospective bride, were viewing the new bridal suite when the balcony gave way

Paramedics were called to the scene shortly after midday this afternoon after the accident

All the women are being treated for their injuries at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. The owner Jack McDaid - who sustained head injuries - was flown by air ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary.

Blood stained pillows lay among shattered glass and twisted metal as police officers investigated the accident.

A waiter at Casa Del Lago said: 'It was a local girl who is planning her wedding and she wanted to see the new suite which has just been done up.

'The owner was showing the girls the balcony when it came crashing down beneath them. The girls were screaming and were scared.

'I ran and used pillows on the owner's head because he was in a bad way.

'We have a lot of weddings here and it is very popular with couples. It is an awful thing to happen and I just hope they are all okay.'

Emergency services said none of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening but some are serious

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'Some of those injured are believed to be serious.'

West Yorkshire fire brigade said firefighters were currently at the scene. A fire spokesman added: 'We have reports of five casualties.'

Sam Holmes, general manager of Casa Del Lago, said: 'After an unfortunate incident today all persons involved are receiving professional care.'Our thoughts remain with them and we wish them a speedy recovery.'

One person was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary with head injuries, a spokesman for Yorkshire Air Ambulance said.

A spokesman for Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust said five ambulances, a doctor and a specially-trained hazardous area response team were also sent to the scene.

The spokesman said: 'Ambulance clinicians provided treatment at the scene and five adults have been taken to hospital for further care.

'One male patient has been airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary and four female patients have been transported by land ambulance to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary.

'All sustained serious injuries but none are believed to be life-threatening at this time.'

The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.
