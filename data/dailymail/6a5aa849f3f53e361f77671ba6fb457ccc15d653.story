An Iranian court has jailed eight activists for a total of 127 years for criticising the government on Facebook.

The defendants, who were handed sentences of 11 to 21 years, were page administrators on the social networking site, according to the official IRNA news agency.

The agency said the defendants were convicted of plotting against national security, spreading propaganda against the ruling system and insulting officials.

It did not identify the defendants or the Facebook pages.

The report said that the court issued its verdict against the eight activists, who come from various cities including the capital, in April following several court appearances.

They appealed immediately, said IRNA.

Facebook is already officially banned in the country, along with other social websites like Twitter and YouTube as well as their mobile apps.

However some senior leaders like Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif are active on Twitter and many Iranians use proxy servers to access banned websites and applications.

President Hassan Rouhani, a self-declared moderate, has promised greater tolerance on social, cultural and media issues - a vow that helped him defeat conservatives in last year's election.

But his fledgling push has been 
opposed by traditionalists and ultra-conservatives who hold sway in the 
establishment and key institutions including the judiciary.

In
 May, eight people were sentenced to jail terms ranging from seven to 20
 years for crimes including anti-regime propaganda posted on Facebook, 
the opposition website Kaleme reported.

Earlier
 this year, an Iranian judge ordered Facebook founder and CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg to appear in court to answer complaints by individuals who 
say Facebook-owned applications Instagram and Whatsapp violate their 
privacy.

Authorities banned
 the social websites after Iranian opposition members allegedly used 
them to organise their protest rallies following the disputed 
re-election of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
