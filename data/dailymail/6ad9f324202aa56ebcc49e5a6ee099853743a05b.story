The urge to join Twitter is tempting when everyone from the Prime Minister to the Pope is posting messages about their daily lives.

But actor George Clooney says anyone who is rich and famous and on the social media site is a 'moron'.

Speaking in an interview with Esquire magazine, the Hollywood star also says the pressures of the 21st Century would have been too much for the stars from the 'golden age' of cinema.

'Not that I'm comparing myself to Clark Gable, whoever, but they couldn't survive in this environment', the 52-year-old said. 

'They'd punch the s**t out of some people. It requires a Zen quality.'

Twitter addict and columnist Caitlin Moran responded: 'If I were friends with Sandra Bullock in real life, I probably wouldn't be on Twitter either, to be honest.'

Despite the actor's rise to global superstardom, he says being famous is restrictive.

In 15 years Clooney has not gone for a walk in New York's Central Park, despite wanting to, and is still surprised by his success. 

'There's a funny thing about fame. The truth is you run as fast as you can towards it because it is everything you want. You get there and it's shocking how immediately you become enveloped in this world that is incredibly restricting.' 

Clooney, who has won two Academy Awards and four Golden Globes, is not the first to criticise the use of Twitter. However, some have had to give in to social media network.

David Cameron said in 2009 that 'the trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it (is) too many tweets might make a t**t'. 

But that didn't stop him setting up an account just before the Tory party conference in 2012 and now he has more than 500,000 followers.

Four years ago Hugh Laurie declared: 'As I look around my friends' tweets, I see banality on all sides.'

He
 now has more than 230,000 followers since he set up his Twitter account
 declaring in under 140 characters: 'Having damned this technology as 
the seed of Satan, I finally succumb'.

Actor Steven Berkoff described Twitter as a 'river of filth'.

George Clooney's latest project sees him team up with Ocean's Eleven co-start Matt Damon once again as they battle to rescue art stolen by Nazis during the Second World War in new movie The Monuments Men.
