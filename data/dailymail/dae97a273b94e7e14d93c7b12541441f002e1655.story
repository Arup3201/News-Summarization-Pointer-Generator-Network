CLICK HERE to read the original story as we revealed the scandal of match-fixing 

More than 300 games in the last year around the world are believed to have involved match-fixing, including a ‘double-digit’ number in England over the past two seasons, according to a variety of integrity sources.

The revelation comes a week after this newspaper revealed that the FA have a secret ‘watch list’ of footballers suspected of being involved in fixing or with fixing gangs.

SportRadar, a Swiss-based firm with a hub in Richmond, Surrey, is known to work in co-operation with various football associations and police forces to combat fixing.

The firm would not comment on specific information it has provided to police or associations but in quantifying the scale of the fixing problem in general, a spokesman told the Mail on Sunday: ‘Our fraud detection system has classified more than 1,500 football matches as suspicious since 2005. We have also detected a lot of other manipulated matches in various other sports.'

Fixing is firmly back on football’s agenda after the former chief executive of the European Professional Football Leagues, Emanuel Medeiros, said last week that he knew of at least one club in Europe being run by criminal gangs for fixing purposes.

‘I have evidence but I cannot say which club or which country,’ said Medeiros, speaking at the Soccerex conference in Manchester.

At the same conference, the president of Sporting Lisbon, Bruno de Carvalho, voiced his fears that the rise of third-party ownership (TPO) of players across Europe has also raised the risk of fixing.

Carvalho said TPO was ‘a monster that is living in almost all the clubs’ and that he believed there were links between some TPO funds and gambling.

‘Many times there are similar owners from the funds and gambling companies, so match-fixing is the worst fear now for football,’ he said. 

Another example of the shocking extent to which fixing now abounds within football was provided by the head of the Hong Kong FA, Mark Sutcliffe.

He described how the HK FA staged an Under 16s friendly tournament last year, and received an intelligence warning from SportRadar that one match would be fixed by a specific score.

He tried and failed to get the Hong Kong police to take an interest. The match ended in exactly the way the high-scoring ‘fix’ was predicted.

SportRadar’s security team monitor not just betting patterns from bookmakers globally but also pivotal incidents in games and movements of players and associates.

In the past six months alone their investigations have led to 60 arrests and 19 charges of match-fixing or similar crimes in countries including Australia and Hong Kong.

SportRadar declined to comment on what if any involvement they have in providing specific intelligence to any UK authorities.

The firm’s director of integrity, Darren Small, said: ‘Match-fixing is not purely a “sport issue”. Treating this as a sport issue does not reflect the reality of today's match-fixing industry.

‘Fixing is organised and executed by the most aggressive and sophisticated organised crime syndicates and structures from all corners of the world. As far as they are concerned, match-fixing requires low investment, carries weak sanctions, has no co-ordinated transnational response and generates serious profit. And these profits are not spent on cars and mansions. They are reinvested in all the other forms of crime that the world works so hard to combat: weapons and people trafficking, prostitution, drug smuggling and so on.

‘None of the stakeholders involved can do this alone and we remain committed to working hand in hand with any and all organisations that are serious about the threat and serious about taking it on.’
