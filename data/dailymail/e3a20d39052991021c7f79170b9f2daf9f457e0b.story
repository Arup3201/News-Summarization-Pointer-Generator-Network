It's the household staple for healthy bones and pearly white teeth.

But for one woman, a love of British whole milk has turned into an uncontrollable addiction which sees her drink ten pints of the white stuff every day.

Sandra Heap from Southport, Merseyside, depends on the drink so much, she won't allow her family to touch her full-fat supply.

Sandra Heap drinks up to ten pints of full-fat milk every day and craves it more later in the evening 

Mrs Heap says she becomes 'narky' if someone in her household dips into her supply of whole milk

The 46-year-old foster carer will even shun alcohol for a glass of the white stuff on nights out.

Mrs Heap, who lives with her husband, son and foster child, didn't drink milk as a child but now can't make it through the day without her fix. 

'During the day I have at least two or three, I usually top six pints between 9am and 10pm,' she said. 

'But I really crave and want milk after 10pm at night, I don’t know if it is something psychological.

'It doesn’t matter if I’m drinking a glass of wine, but if my husband asks me if I want another glass I’ll say ‘no I want a glass of milk’.

'I could even be drinking champagne or be out in a restaurant and if people ask me I’ll say "you know what, can I have a glass of milk?"

'I did drink milk when I was younger and when I was a kid and my brother is a big milk drinker.

'He likes milk but not like me - he doesn’t have to have it every single day, seven days a week.'

On a typical day, Mrs Heap will drink milk in her coffee when she wakes up and then a pint or two with lunch.

She drinks another pint with dinner, but can get through an entire six-litre bottle while watching television between 9pm and 11.30pm. 

Sometimes she'll opt for two strawberry milkshakes with double cream instead. Between 11.30pm and 2am, the foster carer can drink a four-litre bottle.  

She added she sometimes wakes up in the middle of the night and walks to a 24hour shop to stock up on milk if she's run out when the craving strikes her. 

While working at a primary school, Mrs Heap even urged children to swap their milk for fruit juice so she would have more, she said. 

In a designated fridge at her family home, she keeps her supply of blue-topped full fat milk.

The 46-year-old said her favourite way of drinking milk was if it is ice-cold and in a wine glass 

The foster carer buys herself whole milk and stocks up on semi-skimmed for her husband, son and foster child 

And while her children have a habit of ducking into her supply, her husband Graham is less fond of it. 

'Graham actually has a small phobia of milk, it’s God’s honest truth he actually can’t stand the stuff, he’ll have a bit in coffee but other than that if you offered him a £100 to drink a glass - he wouldn’t.'

'If I want a kiss I have to wipe my mouth of the milk or he won’t kiss me. But I think it’s nothing bad, it’s not like I’m on drugs or alcohol.' 

'The problem is I put on weight with it, if I didn’t drink milk I’d be a size 10, but I’m pushing a 12 or size 14 now.

'I would love get hypnotised, but it’s the money, if someone offered to do that I would take it.

'It’s got so bad I don’t even like the taste of water and I think that’s because of all the milk I drink.

'I get narky if I go to the fridge and someone has drunk the blue milk, I ask "who’s done that?’ I tell them "you don’t use the blue stuff, you use the green"'. 

'I buy the big six-litre bottles, then I have to buy a four-pint of semi-skimmed milk for the family, I don’t drink that but I’ve got it there if I am desperate.

'The milk bill easily is topping £25 a week, and then the cream I buy is on top of that, but I’ve tried to cut down on cream.

'As far as my health is concerned I must have great bones.'

For centuries doctors have encouraged milk as a source of calcium which strengthens the bones and teeth. 

Children were administered the drink at schools across the country and overseas. 

If so good for our bones and bodies, can there ever be such a thing as drinking too much milk? 

According to the Dairy Council, whole standardised milk has a fat content of 3.5% compared with 1.7% in semi-skimmed, and 0.1% in skimmed. 

'Relatively small quantities of milk can provide a significant proportion of daily nutrient requirements for all age groups making it nutrient rich relative to its energy content,'  the Council's website states.

But with an estimated 149 calories in a single glass of full-fat milk, drinking large amounts of the substance can lead to weight gain or digestion problems. 

NHS Milk and Dairy Guidelines state:  

'Much of the fat in milk and dairy foods is saturated fat. 

'For older children and adults, eating too much saturated fat can contribute to becoming overweight. 

'It can also cause raised levels of cholesterol in the blood, and this can put you at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke. 

'If you're trying to cut down on fat it's a good idea to go for lower-fat milks.

'Semi-skimmed, 1% fat and skimmed milks contain all the important nutritional benefits of milk, but are lower in fat.'
