Caroline Wozniacki smiled and blew kisses to the crowd after winning for the first time since her break-up with Rory McIlroy.

The world No 17 said she had a ‘clear mind’ and was feeling revived after a holiday in Miami with Serena Williams.

Wozniacki, who decided to take a break after crashing out of the French Open in the first round following her split with McIlroy, said: ‘Serena and I had a good time with some of our other friends.’

But British No 2 Dan Evans slammed the umpiring at Eastbourne after he lost  6-2, 6-3 to German qualifier Tobias Kamke.

‘The guy was a shambles at the start,’ said Evans. ‘I don’t understand why he wasn’t listening to what I said, he basically thought he was right.’

Britain’s Kyle Edmund was another first-round casualty, falling to American Sam Querrey 7-6, 6-3.
