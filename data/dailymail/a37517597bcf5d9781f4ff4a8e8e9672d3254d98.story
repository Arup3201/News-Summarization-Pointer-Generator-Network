Manuel Pellegrini has admitted Eliaquim Mangala's £32m move to Manchester City has not yet been completed.

The Porto defender completed his medical in Manchester and toured the club's Carrington training complex two weeks ago before going on holiday.

Mangala, 23, was even filmed on a leaked video saying he wanted to help City to retain their Barclays Premier League title and win the Champions League.

But Pellegrini, speaking after City had thrashed AC Milan 5-1 in Pittsburgh in the latest match of their American tour, said the deal had not been finalised.

'I think it's important not to talk about things that are not 100 per cent, so I'll keep my opinion about that,' he said.

City were outstanding as they dismantled the Italian side with four goals in the opening 26 minutes at Heinz Field.

Injury-plagued striker Stevan Jovetic scored twice, while Scott Sinclair, Jesus Navas and Kelechi Iheanacho were also on target.

Pellegrini said the fans can expect to see more of Jovetic this season after he made only 11 league appearances last term.

'Well Stevan had a very bad luck last year, he had a lot of injuries the whole year, so it's very difficult for a player to have an important performance when he cannot play three games in a row,' he said.

'In this year he starts the pre-season - well he finished last [season] as well - playing well and I think that now he works continually every day and he will demonstrate why he's here at Manchester City because I think he's a very good player.'

Pellegrini was full of praise for the manner of his team's performance against Milan, who also conceded five against City in pre-season last year.

He said: 'I think it was a very good game for our team it's always important to win and to score five goals, but not only that we played with a good pace and that for me is very important at this moment.

'We are in pre-season and we must continue trying to improve the fitness of the team.

'I think that the players know that we are in a new season, we must start from zero at the first game and that's why it is so important to improve every day that we are working here in the United States, that's why we play very seriously.'
