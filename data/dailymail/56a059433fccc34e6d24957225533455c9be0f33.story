The Pentagon's F-35 fighter jet programme has been plagued with problems and spiralling costs.

But this week, the Department of Defense was keen to put the aircraft's troubles to one side to launch its first weapons test - using an inert bomb with no target.

The test marks something of a step forward in the programme, which may yet be axed to reduce the $1.4trillion U.S. deficit.

Current Pentagon plans call for 
buying 
some 2,443 F-35s for the Air Force, 
Marine Corps and Navy through to the mid-2030s at a cost projected to 
top  $396billion (£254billion). In February last year the Pentagon said 
the price of each fighter jet could rise to a staggering $304.15million (£194.8million).

Test complete: The Pentagon this week successfully carried out its first weapons test on an F-35 jet to see if it could drop an an inert bomb on no particular target

The 1,000lb inert bomb was released over the Atlantic, the Naval Air 
Systems Command said in a statement. Wednesday's test checked the jet could actually release a bomb from its 
carriage systems and path away from the aircraft but did not check for targeting.

'The
targeting aspect will come further down the road,' said Victor Chen, 
spokesman for the F-35 integrated test facility at Patuxent River, 
Maryland. He declined to say when however.

The event, which was captured on film, is one of thousands being tested this year and starts the 'validation' of the 
ability to drop precision weapons on the ground and in 
the air, the command added.

Dogged by problems: In February last year the Pentagon said the price of each fighter jet could rise to $304.15million (£194.8million)

The F-35B is the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the F-35A aircraft.

It has just two-thirds of the A system's fuel capacity in order to make room for its vertical flight design.

Unlike other F-35 designs, the B aircraft has no landing hook.

Instead, it sends jet thrust straight downwards during vertical take-offs and landings.

Captain Erik Etz, director of test for the naval 
versions, said in the statement: 'While
this weapons separation test is just one event in a series of hundreds 
of flights and thousands of test points that we are executing this year,
it does represent a significant entry into a new phase of testing for 
the F-35 programme.'

The Pentagon this year postponed 
production of 179 F-35s until after 2017, stretching out development and
testing to curb costly retrofits. But the
latest restructuring, the third such major revamp, has added 33 months and an extra $7.9 billion to the development plan.

Last year The commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps  General James Amos defended the programme and said there was 'no plan B' if the plans were axed.

He said at the time: 'To do the things that our nation requires of this Marine Corps, we need this airplane. So I don't speculate: "Will it make it through probation?" I'm absolutely confident it will.'

Hundreds of additional F-35s are 
expected to be purchased by U.S. friends and allies, including eight 
co-development partners - Britain, Italy, Turkey, Canada, Australia, 
Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands.

The
F-35, also called the Lightning II, is designed to replace a range of 
fighter, strike and ground-attack aircraft, including the F-16, 
the world's most widely used fighter jet.
