David Cameron insists he will play a tennis match won in a Tory auction, despite a growing row about the party taking money from wealthy Russians.

Boris Johnson signalled he will pull out of the match if it emerges it was won at auction by a ‘crony’ of Vladimir Putin, but later suggested the game will go ahead.

Banker Lubov Chernukhin bid £160,000 for the chance to play the ‘ultimate tennis match’ against Mr Johnson and David Cameron.

Prime Minister David Cameron, on a visit to Glasgow University, insisted returning the money would not be the 'right approach'

She is married to billionaire oligarch Vladimir Chernukhin, who was Russia’s deputy finance minister during Putin’s first term as Russian President.

Mr Cameron has called for tougher sanctions against Moscow in response to the shooting down of a Malaysian Airlines flight by pro-Russian separatists over eastern Ukraine.

But the Tories have been embarrassed by the revelation that they have received money from someone who has served in the Putin regime.

In an angry statement to MPs on Monday, the Prime Minister said Mr Putin’s ‘cronies’ should be isolated because of their country’s involvement in the Flight MH17 atrocity.

But Labour questioned the Prime Minister’s intention to go ahead with a doubles tennis match, auctioned off at a lavish Tory fundraising dinner at London’s Hurlingham Club. 

With Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson apparently planning to don their whites for the game, Tories’ election strategist Lynton Crosby is said to have agreed to act as a ballboy.

The successful bidder was the wife of Vladimir Chernukhin, who is a former director of Russia’s national airline Aeroflot and a former chairman of the country’s state development bank.

He received Russia’s Order of Honour from Mr Putin a decade ago.

During a visit to Scotland, Mr Cameron was asked whether he would return Mrs Chernukhin's cash.

He replied: 'Well of course I wouldn't accept money from someone who was a Putin crony, but my understanding is this person certainly isn't that and has lived in Britain for many years and is actually now a British citizen, so I don't think that would be the right approach.

'My understanding is they are both British citizens they are not cronies of President Putin, so it would be the wrong thing to do to take a different view.'

David Cameron is facing calls to return money bid in an auction to play him and Boris Johnson in a game of tennis, won by Lubov Chernukhin

A Conservative Party source said it was not credible to call Mr Chernukhin an ally of Putin, when he had been dismissed as the head of a state-owned bank in 2004 and had been close to former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who had become a critic of Putin’s style of governing.

However, Mr Johnson appeared to suggest the party was still examining Mr Chernukhin’s background.

Mr Johnson told Sky News: 'I think you have to do stuff that actually hits Putin and his government where it hurts, make a real difference to their attitude.

'I know about this tennis match – they volunteered me to play tennis with some geezer. It is very, very important that full checks are carried out to make sure that this is not somebody who is an intimate of Putin or a crony. And we are doing that at the moment.'

Labour has stepped up calls for the Conservatives to cancel the game and return the money.

Labour’s Chris Bryant, vice-chairman of Parliament’s all-party group on Russia, said: ‘The Prime Minister said quite categorically this week that we should be tackling Putin’s cronies.

‘What could be more of a crony than Putin’s former deputy finance minister?

‘Yet it appears that the Prime Minister is not only prepared to take his family’s money, but also play tennis with him – it is two-faced.

‘David Cameron does not seem to realise that you cannot send these kind of mixed messages to Russia – they see it as a sign of weakness. He has to realise that he cannot have his caviar and eat it.’

Fellow Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: ‘People will be surprised at the extent of Russian wealth bankrolling David Cameron’s re-election fund.

‘The Tories need to come clean about all their Russian links. There can be no impression of conflicts of interest or hypocrisy at such an important time.’

Former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft also questioned whether the Conservatives should still be accepting Russian money. In a message on Twitter he said: ‘Should the Tory Party suspend taking donations from companies owned by Russians?’
