A third of children are now officially considered overweight, worrying figures have revealed.

The crisis is at its worst among those aged 11 to 15, with almost four in ten at risk from damaging levels of fat.

A 20-year study of electronic health records lays bare the problem among children in England. It shows the numbers classed as overweight or obese jumped by about 8 per cent a year in the late 1990s.

The rates of increase have slowed in the last decade, fuelling hopes the rise may have levelled off. 

But experts warned there was no room for complacency and extra efforts must be made to rescue the ‘lost generation’ of overweight teenagers.

The figures are particularly concerning as obese children have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease in later life. They are also more likely to experience bullying, low self-esteem and depression. Obesity costs the NHS £5billion a year.

Researchers from King’s College London used the anonymised electronic health care records of more than 370,500 children aged two to 15 between 1993 and 2013.

They found the number who were overweight or obese increased by around 8 per cent a year during the first decade of the study.

But between 2004 and 2013 rates slowed substantially to 0.4 per cent a year, suggesting the growth in obesity may have levelled off.

The group most affected were those aged 11 to 15, with 38 per cent of boys in this age range found to be overweight or obese in 2013.

The pattern is similar among girls, says an online report in the Archives of Disease in Childhood.

Among both sexes and all age groups, the proportion of children judged too heavy was around a third in 2013. The researchers said the fact obesity rates had stabilised suggested public health campaigns may be starting to work.

But other experts are concerned that strategies to deal with child obesity are not proving effective. These include the Government’s flagship ‘responsibility deal’, under which food and drinks manufacturers set their own targets for cutting sugar and fat.

Professor Julian Hamilton-Shield, of Bristol University, said telling children to eat less and exercise did nothing to address the amount of time they spent looking at computer, television or smartphone screens. 

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘The real problem is among children aged 11 to 15 who are really getting fatter.’

He added that efforts should be made to reduce the number of women who start off their pregnancies overweight and obese.

‘This starts the whole cycle in children,’ he said. ‘Fat women produce fat babies who are at greater risk of many health problems from the beginning of life.’

Dr Colin Michie, chairman of the nutrition committee of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said young teenagers ‘are likely to be easily influenced by the world around them, through advertising and access to pocket money-priced fast food’.

He added: ‘The result – heavier children mean higher rates of serious obesity-related health conditions like type 2 diabetes. 

'If we are to make inroads we need to create a healthy environment by ensuring that children are not exposed to junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed, licences for fast food restaurants are not granted to restaurants close to schools or colleges, a taxation on foods high in salt, sugar and fat is explored and young people are taught how to cook healthy meals in school much earlier.’

Public Health England’s Eustace de Sousa said: ‘Overall childhood obesity rates have remained stable since 2010. 

'However, for children from the poorest households, levels have continued to worsen, so there is no room for complacency.’

Professor Hamilton-Shield, a paediatrician and diabetes specialist, said: ‘The childhood obesity crisis in England is far from over and our current weapons in the war against fat seem unlikely to provide the answer.’
