Missing: Terror suspect Ibrahim Magag who was under close police surveillance has gone missing

Al Qaeda-linked terror suspect Ibrahim Magag went on the run by calling for a black cab, it was claimed today.

The Somali-born 28-year-old was being held under security measures 
because of the threat he poses to the public but disappeared on Boxing 
Day.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper claimed in the Commons he had evaded
 detection by calling a taxi and demanded to know why he had been 
allowed to return to London.

Counter-terrorism detectives made the unusual decision to appeal for 
help over the Christmas holidays to trace the extremist after he went 
missing.

Magag, who is understood to have attended terrorist training camps in 
Somalia, absconded from a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure
 (Tpim) notice after ripping off his electronic tag.

Mrs May insisted the police and security services did not believe Magag 
was involved in current terrorist planning and that great efforts were 
being made to find him.

But Ms Cooper told MPs that a tweet from London taxi news service 
Cabwise suggested Somali-born Magag had evaded detection by picking up a
 ride less than half-a-mile from Euston station on Boxing Day.

In a fierce exchange with Home Secretary Theresa May, Ms Cooper said: 
‘Are you worried that surveillance can be shaken off simply by jumping 
into a black cab?

Magag, who is thought to have raised funds for al Qaida, was originally 
handed a control order and forced to live in the West Country away from 
his network of friends.

But under the new Tpim regime, introduced last year thanks to support 
from the Liberal Democrats, he was able to move back to London.

He is described as a black man of Somali origin, 6ft 2in and slim to 
medium build. He has a beard, but detectives warned he may try to change
 his appearance.

He was last seen wearing a khaki robe, a black Berghaus windcheater and navy Converse trainers.

Asking an urgent question in the Commons, Ms Cooper claimed Magag’s 
escape had been made easier by the Government stopping relocation of 
suspected terrorists.

She said: ‘You allowed Magag to return to London. You have not answered 
the question about whether it would have been harder to abscond in the 
West Country, where he was made to live under a control order - harder 
to get help from his associates, harder to hide, harder to get forged 
papers.’

Ms Cooper said absconds had stopped under control orders once the powers
 were toughened up - including greater use of relocation.

And she added: ‘You chose to ditch relocation, you have personally made it easier for people to abscond.

‘Other people previously relocated under control orders are also now 
back in London on Tpims. Could any one of them simply jump in a black 
cab tomorrow and be off?’

Keith Vaz, who is chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told 
the Commons it was understood Magag had forged passports when in 
Somalia.

He asked Mrs May if Magag was in possession of his passport when he went missing.

The Home Secretary said she must consult the details of a previous anonymity order before providing an answer.

Defending Tpims, she said terror suspects had absconded before while 
under the old restriction - several of whom were never found.

She said: ‘In six years of control orders, there were seven absconds and
 of those seven cases, six were never apprehended. Magag’s abscond is 
serious and the authorities are doing everything they can to locate 
him.’
