Two carers secretly filmed slapping, jabbing and humiliating a brain-damaged patient as he lay groaning in bed have been warned they face jail.

Shocking footage shows Rita Page, 68, and Lynette Crook, 33, smacking the young victim’s legs and swearing at him as they changed his bedding at a £3,000-a-week Priory care home.

On the recording, made after relatives became concerned about his treatment at the private hospital, Page can be heard insulting the helpless patient as a ‘b*****d’ and a ‘dirty scummy boy’.

Concerns: The footage was filmed between August 28 and September 19 in 2012 by the patient's family who were worried about the victim's treatment at the privately-run hospital

Investigation: Healthcare assistants Rita Page and Lynette Crook were suspended from their duties and were arrested after the footage was handed over to police

Abuse: The victim, who had suffered brain damage following an accident when he was a youngster, cannot be named for legal reasons

She also tells her colleague ‘there’s this very fine line between abuse and neglect’.

Crook is captured telling the patient: ‘I don’t do sick, so stop it, scummy lad.’

The
 women were arrested after relatives handed the recordings to police and
 the pair have now been warned they face jail after admitting slapping 
the man and jabbing him with a pen.

His family called for vulnerable patients’ care to be routinely videoed, saying responsible carers would have nothing to hide.

Clip: The film emerged as Crook and Page were warned they faced jail after they pleaded guilty to charges of ill treatment of the patient on the first day of their trial at Bolton Crown Court

Secret footage: Both were bailed pending a sentencing hearing in May, but a judge warned them 'immediate custody was likely'

Astonishing abuse: The two carers were filmed slapping, jabbing and humiliating a brain-damaged patient

The
 victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered brain damage in
 an accident when he was younger. He was looked after at the Priory 
Highbank specialist unit for neurological disorders in Bury, Greater 
Manchester, part of the Priory Group.

However,
 his family feared staff had not investigated their concerns about his 
treatment and hid surveillance cameras around the man’s room.

Among
 footage recorded in August and September 2012, Page is heard saying: 
‘You won’t beat us, b*****d. There’s this very fine line between abuse 
and neglect. Don’t you dare be sick on me boy, don’t you dare – you 
dirty scummy boy.’

Watching: Believing their concerns had not been addressed by senior staff, the family hid secret surveillance cameras around the man's room at The Priory Highbank Centre specialist hospital

Caught on camera: Page (left) pleaded guilty to two charges relating to use of abusive language and slapping the patient's leg during a struggle when she put a pillow between his leg

Astonishing: Crook (pictured) pleaded guilty to three charges relating to her jabbing the patient in the torso and head with a pen whilst he was asleep, using abusive language and slapping his leg while taking blood pressure

Crook is heard saying: ‘Better not think about being sick on me, lad. I don’t do sick, so stop it, scummy lad.’

Both
 women were suspended and this week pleaded guilty to charges of 
ill-treatment of the patient on the first day of their trial at Bolton 
Crown Court.

Page, from 
Bury, admitted two charges relating to her use of abusive language and 
slapping the patient during a struggle when she put a pillow between his
 legs. Crook, of Ramsbottom, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to three charges
 relating to jabbing him in the torso and head with a pen while he 
slept, using abusive language and slapping his leg as she took his blood
 pressure.

Seven other 
charges relating to the pair will lie on file. Both women were bailed to
 await sentencing in May but Judge Timothy Clayson warned them 
‘immediate custody’ was likely.

The
 uncle of the victim, who has since been moved to a different home, 
said: ‘All institutions must be brought to justice and we wanted to make
 sure these two women were brought to account for what they did.’

He said the family had been ‘very concerned’ and made several complaints before resorting to hiding cameras in the room.

The
 uncle added: ‘We want a petition for cameras in care homes for 
vulnerable people like him. If you have nothing to be ashamed of then it
 won’t be an intrusion.’

Secret
 filming by the BBC’s Panorama in 2011 revealed shocking abuse of 
residents in Winterbourne View, a care home near Bristol for those with 
learning disabilities which was later closed down. While watchdogs 
raised the possibility of extending the use of hidden cameras for 
investigations, any move towards wholesale secret filming is likely to 
breach privacy rules.

A Care
 Quality Commission inspection last month found the Priory home met 
required standards. Malcolm Bower-Brown, of the CQC, said it was a 
‘shocking case’ and that the Commission ‘will not hesitate to take any 
regulatory action necessary’.

A
 Priory spokesman said the abuse was an ‘isolated incident’, adding: 
‘Everyone at the company deeply regrets the unacceptable actions of 
these two members of staff, both of whom had over ten years’ 
service … The company will not tolerate behaviour of this nature and 
both healthcare assistants have been dismissed for gross misconduct.’

Response: The Priory Highbank Centre said the company 'deeply regrets the unacceptable actions of these two members of staff both of whom had over 10 years' service and previously unblemished records'
