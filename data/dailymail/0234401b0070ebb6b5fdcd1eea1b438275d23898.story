Not content with becoming David Beckham's official purveyor of pants, Swedish high street giant H&M has announced that it is to dress the Swedish Olympic and Paralympic teams.

Set to form part of the brand's extensive new sportswear range, the collection will make its debut during the Winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi next year.

In addition to leisure and sportswear, which will be available to buy from January 2014, H&M will also produce the outfits for the Opening and Closing ceremonies.

Vision: H&M's patriotic designs for Team Sweden mirror the country's blue and yellow flag

Stars: Ice skating sisters, Viktoria and Joshi Helgesson, and biathlete David Ekholm will star in the campaign

Athletes who will feature in the initial campaign include ice skating sisters, Viktoria and Joshi Helgesson, and biathlete, David Ekholm.

'It is such an honour for H&M to dress both the Swedish Olympians and Paralympians for the upcoming Games in Sochi and Rio,' said Ann-Sofie Johansson, H&M’s head of design.

'The designs will bring together sport and fashion in a totally new way and have Swedish heritage as a proud influence on the collection.'

'I am very pleased to announce this long-term partnership with H&M, starting with H&M equipping the Swedish Olympic team for the Winter Games in Sochi 2014,' added Stefan Lindeberg, chairman of the Swedish Olympic Committee.

'H&M’s approach is innovative and exciting, involving a group of our athletes in the design process. We are proud to be working with H&M, a Swedish brand which is known throughout the world.'

Although the collection is a first for H&M, it isn't the first time that an Olympic squad has turned to a high street retailer for clothes.

At the 2012 Olympics, Team GB wore gold and white tracksuits by Next to the Opening Ceremony, although the rest of the kit was designed by Stella McCartney.

Upmarket: Team USA wear Ralph Lauren but ran into trouble when it was found that the kit was made in China

The majority of Olympic teams, however, have chosen not to embrace the high street, with Team USA continuing to work with Polo Ralph Lauren and Italy with Giorgio Armani.

The Jamaican team wear outfits designed by Bob Marley's daughter Cedella while the French, true to form, roped in Hermes to create beautifully tailored jackets for their equestrian team.

Far more down to earth is the Netherlands, whose bright orange kit was created for them by sportswear giant Nike.

While H&M may not have the cache of Hermes and Armani, the athletes who will be donning the new kit have declared themselves 'really happy' about the decision to go high street.

'To represent our country wearing clothes from a Swedish company will strengthen the team, our team spirit and image to the outside world, especially when it is an internationally renowned brand like H&M,' says Anja Pärson, former alpine skier and multiple Olympic champion.

'I’m really happy that H&M has invited us to take an active part in creating the clothing that the Swedish team can wear with pride during the Olympic Games at Sochi in 2014 and Rio de Janeiro in 2016.'
