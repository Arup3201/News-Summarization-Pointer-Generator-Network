Eight hundred jobs at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant were saved yesterday after an 11th-hour climbdown by Unite.

Owner Ineos had announced it was going to close the operation after the union rejected a survival plan – including a pay freeze and watered down pensions.

But staff were told of the reprieve after Unite was forced into a humiliating change of heart. The union has accepted a three-year pay freeze and committed not to strike during that period. It also agreed to scrap gold-plated ‘final salary’ pension schemes for staff, who earn an average salary of £55,000.

Decision: The owners of the plant, Ineos, said the site had to be shut down because it is losing £10m a month

The deal means Ineos – majority owned by reclusive billionaire Jim Ratcliffe – will invest £300million in the Falkirk plant in Scotland.

He said: ‘This is a victory for common sense. The Unite union advised employees to reject change and vote for closure. Thank goodness people finally came to their senses. Grangemouth now has a great future.’

Prime Minister David Cameron added: ‘On a day when the economy is picking up it’s excellent news that a really important petrochemical plant will stay open, saving thousands of jobs not just at that plant but in the supply chain, and also seeing the refinery reopen, it’s good news.

'I think sense has been seen which is that, when you have challenges and costs, you need reform.’

Anger: Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman Calum Maclean (R) and Gordon Grant, Ineos site manager blamed the Unite union for the crisis, but insisted commonsense had prevailed

Saved: 800 jobs at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, would have been lost if the closure had gone ahead

Unite initially advised staff to reject the company’s cost-cutting plans, winning support from 65 per cent of its members.

But the union’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, said it had now decided they had to ‘embrace’ the survival plan, ‘warts and all’, to prevent the loss of 800 jobs.

It emerged last night that BP, which sold the Grangemouth plant to Ineos in 2006, was also instrumental in helping to secure its survival – agreeing new financial terms to help stem losses of £10million a month.

Cheers: Workers who thought their jobs had been axed just two days ago were quick to share the news that the decision had been reversed

Changes: Employees at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant will still face changes to their pay and pensions as part of the cost-cutting deal to save the site

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘This is a very positive result. We can now look forward to a future of growth at Grangemouth.’

The dispute, which was also said to threaten the adjacent oil refinery,  began over Ineos’s treatment of Stephen Deans, the union shop steward and local Labour Party chairman who was under investigation over allegations linked to the Falkirk vote-rigging affair.

He was cleared of wrongdoing but Ineos conducted its own probe against a backdrop of proposed  new working practices – triggering industrial action. Grangemouth (UK) chairman Calum MacLean said: ‘Unite risked 800 jobs and one of the UK’s largest manufacturing facilities. Today’s U-turn means Grangemouth now has an excellent future.’
