A mother almost served her seven-year-old daughter a dead caterpillar with her lunch.

Sarah Tweedie-Connor, 33, couldn’t believe her eyes when she noticed the shrivelled up bug inside a tin of sweetcorn as she was about to plate up the meal for Teri-Leigh.

She made the grisly discovery after she bought the Happy Shopper branded tin of vegetables from the Premier Store near her home in Holbrooks, Coventry.

Ms Tweedie-Connor, a full-time mum, said: 'My daughter was off school poorly and we fancied some lunch. So I did some new potatoes and poached egg and she wanted some sweetcorn with it.

'It was nearly cooked and I stirred it and then I saw this white thing in the pan. It wasn’t until I had a closer look that I realised what it was.

'I took it out with a spoon and felt really sick. Teri-Leigh was mortified and I’m just so glad that I saw it.'

She added: 'The thought of it being so close to being put on our plates makes me feel sick.

'I’ve emailed the company and had a phone call - they want me to send the empty tin and the  caterpillar to them.'

Ms Tweedie-Connor also received a letter from Booker - the company that runs Happy Shopper - which read: 'We were sorry to learn that you have experienced a problem with our product and would like to offer our sincerest apologies.

'Once we have received the product, all information will be forwarded to the manufacturers requesting a full investigation.

'Once this is complete you will be contacted with their findings.'

A Booker spokesman added: 'Booker takes the quality and safety of our food very seriously. This is a very rare occurrence and we have launched a full investigation.'

This caterpillar is not the first unexpected ingredient to have almost made it into a dinner.

In February Nicola Davies from Staffordshire found the bug in a tin of Sweet Harvest sweetcorn from Aldi.

A few weeks later Sharon McBride's grandson Conner Key managed to stop her from eating a dead cricket floating in a Del Monte can of fruit salad.

In 2010 mother Alison Mugford received £20 compensation from Tesco after finding a wasp embedded in a Jaffa Cake her two-year-old son Hayden was eating.The same year an unnamed shopper opened a bag of lettuce bought from Tesco in Lewes to discover a live Egyptian giant grasshopper inside.Even ready meals bought from posh retailer M&S have been found to have extra ingredients, in 2011 Jemma Cohen and Christyanna Mendel began eating a roasted vegetable and pesto pizza only to discover a whole cockroach among the toppings.And in 2013 Jenna Murray bought a £3 smoked mackerel, beetroot and new potato ready meal from an M&S branch in Camden, north London, which contained a whole dead beetle.
