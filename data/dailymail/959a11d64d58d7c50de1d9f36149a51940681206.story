Arsenal are monitoring Celtic central-defender Virgil van Dijk ahead of a potential January swoop.

The Gunners made a deadline day enquiry for the Holland international but their move for the centre-half came too late.

But scouts will continue to keep tabs on Van Dijk in the coming weeks with a view to a possible move in January.

Arsene Wenger's side remains short of cover in central defence and the position will be an area the club will prioritise once the window reopens, with Van Dijk a serious contender.

The Gunners also looked at moves for Manchester City's Matija Nastasic and Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar on transfer deadline day.

Van Dijk has established a growing reputation at Celtic, but he would find it difficult to snub a move to one of the continent's top leagues.

Queens Park Rangers central defender Rio Ferdinand expects big things from the 6ft 4ins star.

He said this week: 'He is cool, calm and collected in defence. Virgil always appears relaxed and it looks as if there is another gear in there.

'His time for moving will definitely come at some point but look, he's in the Holland squad this week while playing for Celtic, so it can't be too bad for him.'
