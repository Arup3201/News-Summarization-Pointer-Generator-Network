Beyonce has contributed an essay to Maria Shriver's annual report on the status of women in America.

The singer joined top womenâ€™s rights activists like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Facebook COO and Lean In author Sheryl Sandberg, and designer Tory Burch who all wrote essays touting the importance of gender equality.

'We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isnâ€™t a reality yet,' Beyonce wrote in The Shriver Report.

Powerful women: Beyonce has written an essay for a female empowerment project spearheaded by Maria Shriver (seen here together in 2010 at Coachella when Shriver was the First Lady of California)

The Grammy-award winner signed the essay using her hyphenated married name, Beyonce Knowles-Carter.

'Humanity requires both men and women, and we are equally important and need one another. So why are we viewed as less than equal?' she wrote.

'We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities.'

Beyonce was not the only celebrity to contribute an essay to the free packet, as Eva Longoria wrote about the need to empower Latinas and basketball superstar LeBron James who wrote a letter in appreciation of his single mother.

Who run the world? Both Beyonce and Shriver have been outspoken advocates for gender equality

'You think LeBron James is a champion? Gloria James is a champion too. She's my champion,' he wrote.

Beyonce has been a vocal proponent of female empowerment through her music for years- with Independent Woman and Who Run The World (Girls) among her biggest hits.

She has also been more vocal about the concept of feminism in press statements over the past year, including an April 2013 interview with British Vogue where she said that she is a modern-day feminist.

'I do believe in equality and that we have a way to go and it's something that's pushed aside and something that we have been conditioned to accept,' she explained after being criticized for calling her latest tour The Mrs Carter Show World Tour.

Political action: Beyonce, and husband Jay Z (seen together at the President's second inauguration), have been big supporters of the Obamas and Democratic causes

'But I'm happily married. I love my husband.'

This may be the first time that Beyonce worked partnered up with Ms Shriver- a member of the Democratic Kennedy clan- for an outreach project but certainly not the first time that she has become involved in political issues.

Beyonce is a strong supporter of President Obama and has regularly performed at events for him and spoken out on behalf of causes that First Lady Michelle headlines.
