We still coming: A wedding picture has become an internet hit after a number of the guests were apparently accidentally invited when the bride-to-be sent out a message to a wrong number

A wedding invitation that was allegedly accidentally sent to a wrong number has become an internet hit after a stranger said he would turn up with his friends.

The text conversation, which includes the line 'We still coming', has gone viral after being posted online. 

As the text gained attention online, a subsequent photograph claiming to be that of the happy couple with their newfound friends also emerged.

However it has since emerged the picture was actually a still taken from a music video posted online earlier this month. It is unclear if the text is part of a promotion for said video, is genuine, or is part of a hoax.

The whole incident, which is thought to have originated in the U.S, appears to have been started after a bride-to-be called Kristen sent out an invite to her 'BBQ and wedding photos' following her and Roger's marriage ceremony. 

The message however somehow appears to have gone to a wrong number, who reassures Kristen that despite the fact that they are strangers, 'me and my boys will be there.'

Even after Kristen replies with an apology, adding her invite was only for people the couple actually know, the recipient responds with the line: 'We still coming.' 

The phrase has now become an internet hit after becoming a popular hashtag on Twitter. 

It has been suggested on some sites, including Reddit, that the wedding took place in Detroit, while other news organisations, including the New York Post, have suggested it was actually due to take place in England. 

This picture subsequently emerged after the message was posted online, however it has now been pointed out that it was actually part of a music video released earlier this month

Weddings have been providing the internet with a rich source of material recently, such as the elderly man who became an online sensation with his impressive dance moves at a wedding party.

The unidentified white-haired man was filmed by Edgard Eleuterio Daza from Peru as he toe-tapped his way through several tracks including Rock Around The Clock and Jailhouse Rock at the event.

His jovial moves quickly attracted attention from female admirers and in the video, at the one-minute-50-second mark, he appears with two ladies on his arm.
