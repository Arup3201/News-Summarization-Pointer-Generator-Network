The mother of a model strangled by her obsessive boyfriend has described her anguish at hearing he could be freed from jail on appeal.

Elliot Turner, 21, was given life last year after he murdered Emily Longley, 17, during a jealous rage because he thought she was seeing someone else.

But Turner has now been given leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence.

Emily’s mother Caroline, 51, said: ‘When I got the phone call to say Turner was going to appeal it was gut-wrenching.

'We were just beginning to piece our lives back together but now we feel as if we are living through the heartache again.

‘Turner has dragged us right back into the nightmare. It’s as if he is trying to torment us.’

Emily was born in London but emigrated to New Zealand with her family aged nine. At 16 she returned to Britain to study at college and lived with her grandparents in Bournemouth.

She met ex-public schoolboy Turner, the son of a wealthy jeweller.

In May 2011 he strangled Emily in a bedroom at his parents’ £350,000 home in the seaside town.

His parents Leigh, 54, and Anita, 51, tried to cover up the crime by destroying a confession letter and taking away evidence after the killing.

They were each jailed for 27 months.

Speaking from her home in New Zealand, Mrs Longley said: ‘I will fly to England when he has his day in court because I want to be able to look him in the eye so he knows Emily had a loving family and he cannot tear us apart.’
