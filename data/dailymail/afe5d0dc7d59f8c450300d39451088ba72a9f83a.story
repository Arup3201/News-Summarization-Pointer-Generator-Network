A pilot whose single engine plane ran out of fuel mid-flight miraculously landed the aircraft between two moving cars on a highway.

Eric Klein, from Newton, North Carolina, was just five miles from Hickory Regional Airport when he realized that he was dangerously low on fuel around 11pm on Monday.

He immediately looked for a safe place to land and after considering a parking lot - and realizing it was too full of people - he turned his attentions towards U.S. 321.

Using the cars' lights to guide him on a straight path, Klein brought down the plane safely between two vehicles as they traveled northwards on the highway near Granite Falls.

Lucky escape: Emergency responders surround a single engine plane on U.S. 321 on Monday night after its pilot landed the aircraft between two moving cars after he ran out of fuel

The two drivers, who said they were stunned to see the plane appear beside them, stopped their vehicles and ran to check if Klein was harmed.

No one was hurt in the incident.

'I just didn't know what it was,' driver Joe Greene told WSOCTV. 'I could see these lights flashing and he was right 
up on my bumper.

'Then I began to pull away, so I turned [the car around], went
back and realized it was a plane that had landed right behind me.'

Regrets: The pilot, Eric Klein, said he ran out of fuel five miles short of the airport as he returned from a trip

The second driver, Gerald Cole, said that his wife noticed something strange before he did.

'She spotted it first and she starting yelling "What is that? What is that?" And as soon as I caught good sight of it, I could tell it was an airplane,' he said.

'I just kind of got on my brakes and let him go ahead of me because he came in right over the top of my car. And I let him go ahead. He was weaving back and forth somewhat, but he finally put it down right in the middle of the road.'

Klein had been flying home from West Virginia and planned to land at the Hickory Regional Airport. He believed he had three hours of fuel, but it turned out he had just two hours and ten minutes.

'I wasnâ€™t going to make the airport,' he said. 'I used the cars to kind of direct me in the direction of the highway - the lights from the cars. And I was able to land on 321 successfully.'

Relief: Greene and Cole look at the plane, which landed between them as they drove north of U.S. 321

Probe: Klein apologized but the FAA will also investigate whether there are any faults with the plane

While he was relieved to have landed without a problem - or without causing harm to himself or anyone else on the road - he was apologetic for the incident.

'[I was] frightened, scared,' he said. 'I feel foolish and sorry for all the problems I'm causing people. It won't happen again.'

The road was closed until the plane was towed from the highway to the airport around 3 a.m.

The Federal Aviation Administration plans to investigate and inspectors will interview the pilot and inspect the aircraft, which will likely take a few weeks.
