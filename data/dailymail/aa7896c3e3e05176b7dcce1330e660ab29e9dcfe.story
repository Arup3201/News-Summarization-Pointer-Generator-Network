As news broke last night that Facebook had bought virtual reality firm Oculus VR, one developer took to Twitter to very publicly voice his concerns.

Markus Persson - owner of game company Mojang - said he had been working with the startup to build a virtual reaity version of his popular brick-building game Minecraft.

In a tweet, he said: 'We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus. I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.'

The 34-year-old from Sweden then posted a blog which when into more detail about the decision.

'I definitely want to be a part of [virtual reality], but I will not work with Facebook,' wrote Persson.

'Their motives are too unclear and shifting, and they haven’t historically been a stable platform.

'There’s nothing about their history that makes me trust them, and that makes them seem creepy to me.

'And I did not chip in 10 grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition.

'I have the greatest respect for the talented engineers and developers at Oculus. It’s been a long time since I met a more dedicated and talented group of people.

'I understand this is purely a 
business deal, and I’d like to congratulate both Facebook and the Oculus
 owners. But this is where we part ways.'

As a consolation, Minecraft fans will still be able to play a modified version called Minecrift.

Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite
 game world.'

They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves.

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

 are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player 
progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different

Facebook announced it had bought the virtual reality firm in an unexpected $2bn deal yesterday.

The deal puts the site in direct competition with Sony, which unveiled its own virtual reality Project Morpheus last week.

The future of Facebook? The Oculus Rift headset in action. Facebook announced yesterday it had signed a 'definitive agreement' to buy Oculus VR for $2 billion

MailOnline was able to try Oculus Rift at the CES show in Las Vegas earlier this year.

At first we were sceptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when  attached via straps.

However, once our demo started, doubts were quickly forgotten.

The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good.

While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world.

During several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space, with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user's head moves.

It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality.

The social network said it has reached
 a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR - the California firm 
founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey.

'Mobile
 is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the 
platforms of tomorrow,' said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.

'It's different from anything I've every experienced in my life,' said Zuckerberg.

The
 firm is among the most advanced in the VR field, and recently began 
taking orders for the latest version of its $350 (£211) developers version.

'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Zuckerberg.

'Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate.

'The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform.

'We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this.

'But this is just the start. After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences.

'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Mark Zuckerberg, pictured

'Imagine enjoying a court side seat at
 a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the 
world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face - just by putting on 
goggles in your home.'

The deal includes $400 million (£242 million) in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock.

Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. 

Facebook said: 'While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.'

'We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,' said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR.

'We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways.

'It is a transformative and disruptive
 technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and 
it's only just the beginning.'

Oculus recently raised $75 million (£45 million) to make the headset.

'Over
 the past 16 months, we’ve grown from a startup to a company whose 
technology is poised to change the way we play, work and communicate,' 
said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR at the time.

Palmer Luckey (pictured right) began Oculus when he was just 15, working on prototypes in his parent's garage.

He started developing his own head-mounted VR displays when he was still in high school, and was in college when he created the first prototype of a consumer-priced VR headset called the Oculus Rift - although he eventually left to work on the project full time.

MailOnline met Luckey at the CES show in Las Vegas, where he showed an incredible amount of enthusiasm for the product.

He said he believed the technology's time had come.

The firm originally turned to Kickstarter to raise money, but has since raised funds from investors across silicon Valley - until it was bought by Facebook for $2bn.
