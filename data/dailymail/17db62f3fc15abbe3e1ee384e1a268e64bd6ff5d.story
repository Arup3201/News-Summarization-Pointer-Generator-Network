We'll put talk of the domestic Treble down to a little New Year’s over-excitement on behalf of Radoslaw Cierzniak.

Back on planet Earth, though, this rip-roaring win for Dundee United does, unquestionably, have them very much in contention for the European spots and in decent fettle for the respective cup competitions.

On the kind of night that ages managers beyond their years, Jackie McNamara watched his side somehow surrender a 2-0 lead - only for Sean Dillon to dig them out with a trademark skipper’s header.

Poor Martin Canning. In his first game as Hamilton’s caretaker boss, the home team staged the kind of comeback his predecessor Alex Neil was famed for - but it ultimately all went sour.

United will awake on Tuesday to a Premiership table that sees them sitting third.

Goalkeeper Cierzniak’s prediction of yet catching both Aberdeen and Celtic seems utterly fanciful but at least they are in there to ask the question.

Hamilton should not be too despondent. There were bountiful signs here that normal service will be resumed despite Neil’s departure last week and, just one point shy of the magical 40 mark, they have no reason to reproach themselves.

United’s commitment to promoting youth was again in evidence with McNamara drafting three teenagers - Blair Spittal, Charlie Telfer and Aidan Connolly - into his line-up.

Canning opted to leave himself out of his first managerial selection - Jesus Garcia Tena stepping in.

Before the new man’s era got properly under way, there was a fitting farewell to the one he replaced.

The timing of Neil’s departure for Norwich City meant he didn’t have the opportunity to thank those who had supported him during his time in charge and vice versa.

Had he been watching on TV, though, Neil would surely have had a lump in his throat at the standing ovation those Hamilton fans afforded him in the opening minutes.

Accies started the brighter of the two sides. Ali Crawford’s corner was met with by Garcia Tena’s leap and the Spaniard’s frustration at not working Cierzniak with his header was understandable.

Stephen Hendrie was thankful his error didn’t meet with severe consequences. Dispossessed 35 yards from goal, there was no catching Telfer as he bounced down the line. Were it not for Mikey Devlin’s intervention, Nadir Ciftci would have netted.

Hendrie passed up a chance to redeem himself. Teed up by Tony Andreu, the full-back lashed his shot into the side netting where better options were available.

Once United found their feet, the diminutive figures of Connolly and Telfer seemed to be everywhere.

On one promising counter, Telfer fed his fellow teenager with a lovely pass then bolted into the box in anticipation of the favour being returned, but Connolly went for a goal from a ludicrous angle.

Then a swift interchange between Gary Mackay-Steven, Armstrong and Telfer on the edge of the box resulted in the former Rangers finishing with a crisp strike that could only have been a yard wide.

Accies were powerless to prevent Armstrong opening the scoring seven minutes from the interval.

Even before Connolly’s pass arrived at his feet, there was only one thing on his mind. Having taken one touch to steady himself, his second action was to unleash an arrow of a strike more than 25 yards from goal.

Canning would have reminded his team at the interval that they were only one such piece of magic away from parity provided they hung in there. That plan lasted all of 21 seconds, though.

Straight from the kick-off, United doubled their lead. With Accies’ defence not so much sleeping as in a coma, Armstrong’s simple pass to Mackay-Steven put him within sight of Michael McGovern’s goal and he shot low into the net.

Nadir Ciftci ought to have wrapped the game up in those moments but miscued horribly. How the Turk would regret that.

On 57 minutes, Connolly’s attempted slide-tackle on Andreu gifted Hamilton a free-kick. Garcia Tena did the rest - a swerving left-foot strike going up and over the wall but dipping beautifully into the net.

Some 13 minutes later, the hosts were level. Sent clear by Dougie Imrie, Crawford’s first attempt to beat Cierzniak was blocked by the Pole. But the Accies midfielder maintained his composure to calmly volley the rebound into the empty net. Just two minutes later, though, United were back in front.

Chris Erskine’s corner was met by Dillon, who scored with a thunderous header.

Canning gave himself the last two minutes as substitute but to no avail. On reflection, he might wish he’d involved himself sooner.
