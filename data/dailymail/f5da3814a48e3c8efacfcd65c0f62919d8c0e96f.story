This is the horrifying moment a food truck with a mother and her teenage daughter inside exploded, injuring 11 people.

La Parrillada Chapina, which sold Mexican food in Philadelphia, was left a charred wreck by a huge burst of flame when one of the propane tanks on board exploded.

The entire street can be seen engulfed in fire by the short and violent burst of flame, caught on CCTV. The exploded tank, which was four feet tall, was thrown 150ft by the force of the blast.

People driving past were also caught up in the explosion, with pedestrians nearby saying the force of the blast nearly knocked them off their feet. 

Nine other people were also taken to hospital after the explosion at 5.30pm yesterday in the Feltonville district of the city.

Seven of the burn victims were treated and released from hospital that evening, while the final two remain inside in a stable condition.

Jane Kim, the owner of a store next to the auto body shop, said that the food truck is parked outside daily. She said that she heard the explosion and was shaken by the incident.
