This is the miraculous moment a speed boat is flipped 100 yards across a lake at 263mph and crushed to a pulp - but the driver survives.

Taking a final stab at the world drag boat racing title on Friday, Daryl Ehrlich had just three seconds to shine in his new vessel, Problem Child - the world's fastest hydro boat.

But moments into the race, it snapped, the left wing broke off, and he was sent flying.

Favourite to win: Texas-based Daryl 'Madd Maxx' Ehrlich was driving the world's fastest Top Fuel Hydro boat at the Lucas Oil Drag Boat Racing Series World Finals event in Chandler, Arizona on Saturday

Swerve: But less than two seconds into the three-second race he began to swerve to the side

Before his competitor even reached the finish line, Mr Erlich flipped twice and crashed upside down.

A video of the dramatic moment released by The AZ Top Fuel Group shows onlookers falling silent as the boat finally crashed upside down into the waves and started to sink.

But miraculously, Daryl survived.Â 

Disaster: Debris goes flying as the back is crushed and the left wing snaps off Problem Child, the boat

Flip: It spins again, the whole infrastructure falling out as Daryl clings on inside during the competition

Sinking: As the speed boat comes to a halt it starts to sink and onlookers falls silent. A medical team rushed out

A rescue team dispatched within moments zooms to his side and men in lifejackets jump out to prize Mr Erlich from the cockpit, which had broken off the rest of the boat.

As they lifted him onto a raft to safety, he stuck his hand out with a thumbs-up sign for the crowds.

After being checked out by the medical crew, an unscathed Ehrlich, who rides under the name 'Madd Maxx', made his way back to his pit to be greeted by cheering fans.

Emergency teams: Mr Ehrlich is rescued from the water in his safety capsule by two on-hand teams

Separated: The fibre glass hull of the boat, that made it so fast, is probably the thing that saved him

Problem Child had been a focus of the 
competition, holding the world's top fibre glass hull - making the 
entire boat incredibly fast.

Ehrlich was the number one qualifier in 
Top Fuel Hydro coming into the disastrous race but judges expected him 
to drop to the bottom of the ladder.

However, refusing to let the invention go, he insisted that they put the boat back together.

All afternoon and evening a crew worked to move the hull onto a different model.

And when 'Madd Maxx' came back the next day, he won the competition.
