United scouts regularly watch Brazilian games and have strong links with some of the clubs. Coutinho has scored seven goals in 25 appearances so far this year but has versatility and is quick.

His representative Taciano Pimenta said: ‘I had a query about interest and Manchester United. Obviously if they want to buy, the interest to sell is there. I go to see if it’s official.’

Coutinho is under contract until 2017 and there have been legal disputes over whether he can leave with Atletico struggling for cash burdened with paying off the cost of their stadium build for the World Cup in Curitiba.

Coutinho's current deal is due to expire in 2017 but Atletico could be forced into cashing in on the starlet
