Sick: Charlie, a normally very friendly cat, has now lost her eye because of the attack

A cat has been left partially blinded after unknown abusers cruelly superglued her tail to her eye.

Owner Michelle Pendlebury was shocked when her five-year-old pet Charlie came home with the skin above and below her left eye ripped off.

Michelle, 25, took her straight to the vets where Charlie was kept in overnight before undergoing surgery but her eye was so badly damaged it had to be removed.

Now police and RSPCA officers are looking for the culprits responsible and are appealing for information.

'Charlie doesn't usually wander away for too long but she had been been missing for a few days and when she came home, I was just so shocked at what I saw,' said distraught Michelle, from Swinton, near Rotherham.

'Her eye was nearly falling out and there was superglue on her tail.It was obvious what had happened. The vets did what they could but Charlie's eye was in an awful state and they couldn't save it.

'I'm so upset because she must have suffered terribly but I'm also fuming. I want to find out who's done this and stop it happening again.

'I can't believe anyone could be so cruel to a defenceless animal. Charlie is such a friendly cat. Whoever did this is sick, they're not even human.

'If children were responsible then perhaps, if they were in a group, one of them will realise how serious this is ands come forward.

'I've been told about a similar incident involving a cat in Swinton, it had similar injuries but this cat died. It also happened to my nanna's cat two years ago when its tail was superglued to its back.

'She's still quite jumpy, but I'm trying to encourage her to get used to going outside again,' added Michelle, who has reported the incident to the RSPCA.

A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: 'We have been made aware of this incident and we are looking into it and have been liaising with the police.'

'This is an appalling thing to do to an animal which would have been in extreme pain and we desperately want help to find whoever was responsible.

'We would urge anyone with any information to call the RSPCA in confidence on 0300 1234 999.'
