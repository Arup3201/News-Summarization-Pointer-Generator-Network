An historic house which was once the home of two of Henry VIII's wives has been put up for sale for £1.9million.

Walton Manor, in Walton-on-the-Hill, Surrey, is a 800-year-old country home and was once part of top boarding school Eton College.

As well as a fabulously elaborate home including tennis court, the remains of a chapel, plus other restored Jacobean features, the property is full of history - and was once home to Henry VIII's first and fourth wives.

Steeped in history: The £1.9m Walton Manor, the living room pictured, was once home to two of Henry VIII's wives as well as other notable historical figures

Features: The five-bedroom home, which still has many of its original features such as this flint wall, belonged to Catherine of Aragon - the King's first wife - in 1509

Expansive: The property is split into two sections - one a series of apartments and the other, the older south-west wing, pictured, which is now up for sale

On entering the south-west wing of Walton Manor, the would-be buyer is greeted with a grand reception 
hall, leading on to a cloakroom, drawing room and dining room.

There is also a study, a sun-room and five enormous 
bedrooms - four of which are en suite.

The £1,875,000 property retains a number of its ancient features including flint walls and the original arched entrance.

On the first floor, the windows are all made of stone while one of the rooms includes a restored Jacobean fireplace.

Some elements of a chapel - including a large stone window -  can also be found on the first floor.

Above
 the doorway leading to the upper part of the chapel is a beam which has
 been identified as 'Memel' oak grown in the Bosphorus, which was often 
brought back by ships as ballast.

What an entrance! The property, which was used by Canadian forces in the Second World War, has a very grand hallway complete with sweeping staircase

Modern mix: The property, which was given to fourth wife Anne of Cleaves in 1543, has a stylish and modern kitchen and eating area, pictured

It also has 2.8 acres of land which includes secluded gardens, a tennis court and double garage.

Walton
 Manor is thought to have been built around 1260 by John de Lovelot who,
 from 1275 to 1289, was a Puisine Judge of the Common Pleas.

The south west wing is the oldest part of the
 Manor and originally consisted of a two-storey hall and a chapel.

It is understood that floors and partitions were added in the 17th Century, with many later additions to the back of the property in 1891.

At the conquest Walton Manor was 
granted to Richard de Tonbridge, whose descendants held it until 1314. 
It then passed into the hands of Baron Hugh Despencer until he was 
hanged by Queen Isabella in 1327.

Slick: Despite being over 800 years old, the property - which was renovated 30 years ago - has all the mod cons in its fabulously stylish kitchen

Eating well! The wooden-finished dining room, which would easily seat a dozen guests, is just off the entrance hall

1- Catherine of Aragon (annulled; died while detained under guard at Kimbolton Castle)

2- Anne Boleyn (annulled and later executed)

3- Jane Seymour (died days after giving birth, widely believed to be following birth complications)

4- Anne of Cleves (annulled)

5- Catherine Howard (annulled and later executed)

6- Catherine Parr (widowed)

In 1332, the Manor was held by John de Warrenne who, rather quaintly, was granted the 
right to hold two fairs at Walton Manor.

And prior to being lived in by Henry VIII's wives, the home was also occupied by Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV.

Later on, Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell, who served with Lord Nelson at the Battle of the Nile, lived in the property.

In 1509 King Henry VIII gave the manor to Catherine of Aragon, his first wife.

The couple divorced and in 1533 the manor was granted to Sir Nicholas Carew - an English courtier and diplomat.

The Carew family remained in possession of Walton Manor and much of the land until approximately 1860.

However, in 1543 Anne of Cleaves, the King's fourth wife, moved in. It is unknown how long she stayed in the property.

During The Second World War the Manor was requisitioned by the government and used by the Canadian armed forces.

The
 property was extended after the war and, around 30 years ago, it was 
split into two.

One wing of the expansive property was then converted into posh apartments.

It is the south-west wing of the home which has now been put up for sale through Savills with a £1.875 million guide price.

David Semple, director of Savills' Reigate office described Walton Manor as 'a real gem'.

He said: 'You won't find too many homes which can be traced back 800 years..

'Over the years the home has grown but it has large parts dating back to the 13th century and this is very special.

'It
 is a real slice of history. Short of being an official Royal residence,
 it is unlikely you'll find many properties which were lived in my three
 Queens including two wives of Henry VIII. If the walls could talk.

'It
 is a wonderful family home with an amazing history which adds to the 
charm. If you look at the size of the property and its price, it is 
extraordinary good value.'

A cosy place to rest: Down several steps is one of the property's five large bedrooms - four of which are en suite
