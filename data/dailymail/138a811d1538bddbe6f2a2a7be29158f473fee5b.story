'It will empower you, it will challenge you and you'll beg for mercy however I guarantee that you'll feel amazing afterwards.'

Louise will run two classes in London this weekend to coincide with Valentine's Day and the release of the film Fifty Shades Of Grey.

Describing the workout, she said: 'It will entail low impact but high intensity interval training featuring some of my favourite toning moves, you can expect squats, squats and more squats.' 

In true Christian Grey style, Louise said: 'The workout will empower you, it will challenge you and you'll beg for mercy however I guarantee that you'll feel amazing afterwards'

The heptathlete loves the Fifty Shades books which is why she wanted to incorporate the themes into fitness

Louise hopes her fun class will inspire more people to keep fit

Louise said she's chosen moves inspired by the bestselling EL James erotic novels because she's a fan of the books and wants to find ways to make exercise more fun and accessible to people.

She said: 'I read all three books and I just didn't want them to end, so I designed a workout involving chains and ropes in honour of all young women like me who want to live vicariously through Anastasia Steele!

'Lots of fans will be going to see the film on the day of release, so Christian Grey will be fresh in their minds when they are enduring my tortuous workout and begging for their pain to end.

This week she made it to the final of Channel 4's The Jump where she braved the tallest ski jump

'I wanted to make Valentine's Day fun. Whether you’re single, married or it's complicated, I think it’s important that women feel empowered and happy from the inside out, no matter what day of the year it is.' 

While this is a one-off event, Louise has promised additional workouts later in the year while people can also learn how to emulate her fitness with her Podium Effect programme. 

Louise said: 'I am so excited about 2015, it's all about thinking outside of the box to get more people involved in health and fitness.'
