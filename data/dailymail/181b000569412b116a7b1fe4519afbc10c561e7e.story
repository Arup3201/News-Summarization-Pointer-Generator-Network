Lewis Hamilton will be a better champion for the  image of Formula One than his title rival Nico Rosberg, according to Bernie Ecclestone.

Hamilton is 24 points ahead of his Mercedes team-mate with two races, the Brazilian Grand Prix later on Sunday, and the season finale in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight’s time, remaining.

Ecclestone, interviewed alongside Hamilton, claimed that he was ‘sure’ Rosberg would win this year’s championship at the start of the season, but now feels a triumph for Hamilton would be more beneficial for the sport.

‘At the beginning of the year, I thought Nico would be champion,’ said Ecclestone. ‘I thought that would probably suit the team better. And in my position I thought it would be better for Formula One to have a world champion who can speak several languages.

‘I thought that if there was going to be any help, which I am certain that there hasn’t been, then maybe there would be a bit more support forthcoming from a German team for a German driver. So yes, I was sure that Nico would do it.

‘Privately I thought that Lewis would be a good champion. He is more widely known around the world than Nico. Consequently, he would be the better champion for the sport.

‘I’m sure that, for example, 80 per cent of the people in America know Lewis, and it’s probably the same for the rest of the world. Most people haven’t heard of Nico. Therefore, Lewis would be the better champion as far as this sport is concerned.’

Ecclestone, in the Interlagos paddock, reckons Hamilton will be a better champion for the sport than Rosberg 

Under last year’s rules, a tenth-place finish at today's Brazilian Grand Prix would have been enough for Hamilton to secure his second title.

Yet bizarrely, the Briton who starts the Interlagos race in second place behind Rosberg, could win today and still miss out on the championship under the new double points ruling.

‘Around here, what he [Ecclestone] says goes,’ Hamilton said in a candid interview on the official Formula One website. ‘He’s the boss. He wanted double points for last race of the season and here you go: he’s got it.’

Ecclestone interjected: ‘I wanted it for the last three races. That’s what I wanted. I never thought that it would come to this sort of situation.

‘I thought that Nico would be disappearing in the standings and maybe Lewis would be trying to catch up.

‘Lewis would get his act together and by Monza he’d look as if he had a chance because despite being a long way behind, by winning the next three or four races he could catch up - and with the last three races on double points it could have worked. At least that was the plan. It didn’t work out that way.'
