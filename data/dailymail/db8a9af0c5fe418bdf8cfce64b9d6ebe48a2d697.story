The price of diesel raced to a record high last night in a devastating blow to millions of motorists.

The average forecourt price hit 143.05p a litre – meaning it now costs more than £100 to fill up the 70-litre tank in a typical family car.

It means the price of filling up has increased by £20.50 in just two years – a punishing 26 per cent.

The price of diesel at the pumps now averages 142.9p a litre - just shy of the record of 143.04p set last May

Petrol prices are also on the rise. They hit 135.39p a litre yesterday, just shy of the 137.43p record reached in May last year.

The Retail Motor Industry, a lobby 
group for petrol station owners, said the latest price surge was a 
‘disaster for motorists’ ahead of a planned 3p-a-litre increase in fuel 
duty in August.

It is feared that the rise will push 
up the price of other everyday essentials such as food as everyone from 
farmers to supermarkets look to recoup the higher costs of transporting 
goods.

‘The impact of record diesel prices 
will be felt by everyone as higher transport costs are passed on to 
business and consumers,’ said AA president Edmund King.

‘A stronger pound has staved off this
moment for longer than might have been expected. Diesel drivers across 
the country have been watching in trepidation.

‘They hoped that below-record prices would hold until the spring, when winter price pressures on diesel traditionally ease.

‘With some delivery and haulage firms
adding a diesel surcharge to invoices, costs will rise faster than most
people expect and stoke inflation again.

‘Like petrol, there is no price transparency in the wholesale and retail diesel market.’

Soaring: Diesel has now reached £1.43 per litre - and prices could go even higher before Easter

He added: ‘Although the diesel price 
has been influenced by refinery closures, unreliable supply into Europe 
and stock market speculators taking advantage of a tight market, there 
is no way for businesses and consumers to find out whether or not they 
are paying a fair price.’

The recent rise in oil price has come
as a surprise. It was thought the price would remain stable at a lower 
level but tensions in the Middle East and Iran have driven it up amid 
fears about supply from the oil-rich region.

The AA has written to Chancellor 
George Osborne calling for an investigation of the oil, refining, fuel 
product and retail markets ‘to ensure UK families and business are 
protected from over-inflated prices and supply difficulties’.

It has also called for an end to 
annual fuel duty hikes while the economy falters. This includes 
cancelling the planned rise in August.

Northern Ireland has the highest average petrol prices - 135.9p a litre - while northern England has the cheapest, at 134.2p (file picture)

Two years ago, diesel in the UK averaged 113.62p a litre. Then, it cost £79.50 to fill the 70-litre fuel tank on a Ford Mondeo.

RMI petrol chairman Brian Madderson 
claimed a ‘perfect storm’ of rising oil prices and worries about supply 
could push diesel and petrol prices even higher by Easter.

He said it would put the livelihoods of hundreds of petrol station owners and staff at risk.

The previous high for diesel was 143.04p a litre in May last year, at the height of the ‘Arab Spring’.

The uprisings in the Middle East and 
North Africa pushed up oil prices, and in turn prices at the pumps, amid
fears over a shortage of supply.

RAC spokesman John Franklin said: 
‘The new record price of diesel shows the issue of rising fuel prices 
isn’t going away. Drivers continue to be hit hard in their pockets 
during these tough economic times.

‘With a further 3p-a-litre fuel duty rise planned in August, we hope the Chancellor will take a look at this in the Budget.’
