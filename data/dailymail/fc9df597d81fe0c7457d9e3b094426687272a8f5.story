Investigators have processed the vehicle in hopes of gaining information as to the whereabouts of Miss Stuart.

Investigators do not believe there is any evidence of foul play at this time and no search and rescue parties have been organized. 

The police asked for the public's help in locating Miss Stuart as she may not be taking needed medications that she needs.

Miss Stuart's father, Don Stuart, told KTLA that his daughter had lost weight since the photos (seen above) were taken. 

The 29-year-old was last seen wearing a camouflage hat, white shirt, black pants and white shoes.

The woman was described as 5'7', weighing 107lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes.

Anyone with information was asked to contact the Sheriff Department at 760-956-5001 or 760-552-6800.
