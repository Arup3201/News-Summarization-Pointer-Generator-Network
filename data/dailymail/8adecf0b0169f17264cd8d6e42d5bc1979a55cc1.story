Police officers investigating the Plebgate scandal secretly obtained the telephone records of the senior Fleet Street journalist who first broke the story, it has been revealed.

A Metropolitan police report into the ongoing saga, which was published yesterday, revealed that the force arrested an officer on suspicion of leaking information to the Sun after analysing the phone records of the newspaper's political editor Tom Newton Dunn.

Scotland Yard also obtained call records to the Sun to try to identify a second potential source providing information about the Plebgate row in which the former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of swearing at police officers guarding Downing Street.

The National Union of Journalists have accused the police of an ‘outrageous abuse’ of their position, while Tory MP Mark Reckless today demanded to know if journalists’ sources were safe.

Mr Newton Dunn did not know that his phone records had been secretly obtained by the police.

Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act police have to go to court to ask a judge’s permission to get records belonging to a journalist.

Journalists are then notified to give them the chance to fight against their records being investigated.

Michelle Stanistreet, of the National Union of Journalists, said: ‘Instances like this amount to the outrageous criminalisation of sources who have taken the decision that information they are in receipt of deserves to come to the attention of the public.'

She added: ‘If whistleblowers believe that material they pass to journalists can be accessed in this way – without even the journalists and newspaper knowing about it – they will understandably think twice about making that call.'

A Sun spokesman said the newspaper was 'concerned' about the revelation. He said the Sun understood the intrusion 'was authorised by a police officer rather than a judge, for the apparent purpose of exposing a whistle-blower who was ultimately shown to have committed no criminal offence'.

The spokesman added: 'We understand this was achieved, without our knowledge, by the use of police powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.

'This circumvented the normal safeguards in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which was designed to give proper protection to journalists and their sources.

'We will be writing to Lord Justice May, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, to ask him to examine how many times and with what justification these authorisations have been made against the media and whether he intends to issue any guidance on the media’s right to keep their phone records safe.'

The Sun first published a front-page story on September 21, 2012, revealing Mr Mitchell had clashed with armed officers at Downing Street after they refused to let him cycle out of the main gate.

The revelation sparked a political row, eventually forcing Mr Mitchell to resign from the Cabinet. 

But the Tory MP has consistently denied calling the police officers 'plebs'. It has since emerged that officers 'conspired' to undermine Mr Mitchell. 

The revelation that police secretly obtained Mr Newton Dunn's phone records emerged after the Met published a series of documents summarising its inquiry into the aftermath of the plebgate incident, which resulted in four police officers being sacked.

Yesterday's report identified a female officer who texted a colleague two days after the incident to declare that she could ‘topple’ the Tory government.

The report also contained new CCTV footage of the heated disagreement between diplomatic protection officer Toby Rowland and then Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell at the gates of Downing Street in September 2012.

Previously-unseen CCTV images of the Plebgate row reveal that a passer-by witnessed the confrontation between police and Mr Mitchell.

The man, who is clearly seen following the exchange, has never been traced.

Today’s CCTV footage shows Mr Mitchell cycling down the middle of the street and then talking to three officers at the gate while a fourth stands nearby outside.

In the original police account, several members of the public are said to have witnessed the exchange and were ‘visibly shocked’. 

A Dispatches documentary for Channel 4 challenged this with images obtained from CCTV shot from within Downing Street.

But today's separate CCTV footage shows there were at least three members of the public outside the gates at the time of the row.

At least one appeared to be listening to the exchange.

PC Rowland alleges Mr Mitchell called police officers ‘****ing plebs’ during their exchange. Mr Mitchell denies he used the word ‘pleb’ but has apologised for swearing.

Tory MPs and supporters of Mr Mitchell said that, despite the report being a ‘police report into the police’, it still showed dishonesty by officers working in Downing Street.

They said serious questions must now be asked about whether the Diplomatic Protection Group in charge of guarding No. 10 was fit for purpose.

Mr Davis, a former shadow Home Secretary, said: ‘What we have got here is evidence of industrial-scale dishonesty. There was a pack of policemen telling a pack of lies. This involved serious collusion between police officers who set out to harm the democratically elected Government.

‘Despite their attempts to justify their action on security grounds, it transpires that the only written guidance was that ministers should have ‘unfettered access at any time of day or night and at any entry point’.

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This overdue report offers further evidence of the concerted deception used by police officers to stitch up Andrew Mitchell.

‘It’s shocking that specialist officers recruited to protect Downing Street saw fit to engage in such an outrageous plan to topple a senior minister. It’s a serious blow to public confidence in the police.’
