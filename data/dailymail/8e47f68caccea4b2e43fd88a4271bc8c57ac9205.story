Jailed: HIV-positive Alan Mason, 45, admitted causing GBH by having sex with a woman without protection

A man who intentionally infected his girlfriend with HIV has been jailed after admitting causing grievous bodily harm.

Alan Mason, 45, from Endmoor, Cumbria, discovered he had HIV three years before he had unprotected sex with the woman, but still didn't bother to tell her, Carlisle Crown Court heard.

Mason was jailed for two years and eight months by Judge Paul Batty QC, who told him: 'I am of the view that you deliberately targeted this hapless, vulnerable woman.' 

The court was told that Mason, a divorced father of two, was diagnosed in 2008.

He met the 39-year-old woman, from Barrow, in a pub in Kendal in March 2011, and began a relationship with her.

When she began feeling ill while on holiday seven months later, her GP suggested she be tested for sexually transmitted infections.

Prosecutor Alex Leach told the court that when she told Mason what the doctor had said, he broke down and told her he was HIV positive.

He said that when a blood test later revealed that she, too, had HIV, she 'went into total shock' and thought she was going to die because of the 'alarming' amount of weight she lost, the Cumberland News reported. 

In a statement, which was read to the court, she said: 'He has destroyed my life and the fact of what he did to me will live with me for the rest of my life.'

Mason's lawyer said he had lost his home and his job after his marriage ended and he contracted HIV.

Barrister Fraser Livesey said Mason was also shunned by his friends. 

Mason was prosecuted following an investigation by Cumbria Police which began when his victim complained she had contracted HIV from him. 

Detective Constable Damian West said: 'This is a unique case for Cumbria Constabulary and the sentencing imposed highlights the disregard Mason had for his actions.

'Even though the victim has to live with this virus, modern medication means there should be no impact on life expectancy. 

'However, the virus has a significant day to day impact on those who have to live with it.

'If anyone has any concerns they should speak to their doctor, or seek support from dedicated organisations, such as the Terence Higgins Trust.'
