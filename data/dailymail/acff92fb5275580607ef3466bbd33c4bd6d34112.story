A former football player is fighting for his life in hospital today after witnesses revealed that he was 'sucker-punched' by an unknown attacker before a former teammate allegedly kicked him in the head 'like a soccer ball'.

Isaac Kolstad, a 24-year-old former linebacker at Minnesota State-Mankato, had surgery to relieve swelling in his skull at Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato. It is yet unclear if he has suffered permanent brain damage.

Rutgers University quarterback Philip Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, was charged today with one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault.

She said: 'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet. He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.'

She added that the sound of Mr Kolstad hitting the concrete was so loud because he didn't catch himself.
