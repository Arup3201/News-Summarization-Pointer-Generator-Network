The accused shooter: Paula Strange is believed by police to have shot dead husband Bruce Strange before killing herself

A woman reportedly shot dead her husband in front of a packed suburban Atlanta supermarket before then turning the gun on herself.

Paula Strange, 54, is said by police to have shot dead 52-year-old husband Bruce Strange at a Marietta, Georgia Kroger just after 5.30 p.m., authorities said. It happened only minutes after an argument over dinner at a nearby restaurant, a source told MailOnline.

The Kennesaw, Georgia couple was eating at a Mo’s Southwest Grill in the same shopping plaza where the shooting occurred less than half an hour before they were both dead, a person who answered the phone in the fast food joint told MailOnline.

‘They were in our store eating, I assumed they were having an argument,’ the source said, adding that he wasn't sure what the disagreement was about.

The husband then abruptly got up and left the restaurant.

‘The gentleman went to the bathroom, ran out the door, jumped over the patio fence and ran behind the restaurant,’ the worker said.

Witnesses told WXIA the Kennesaw State University associate director of research compliance chased after him in her Honda Element, racing the engine and shouting at him.

He shouted back as he ran towards the supermarket, possibly to escape her.

She then shot him several times before getting out to execute him in front of horrified shoppers before killing herself with a single gunshot, the witness said.

The husband's body was still lying on the sidewalk in front of the store more than three hours later, according to WSB.

'It's just mind-blowing,' one person told the station. 'You come to Kroger to get some groceries... and find out that there is somebody with some kind of issue in their life.'

'They just snapped, and it's just unfortunate,' the shocked witness continued. 'There's families on both sides that are going to be involved and there's going to be a lot of hurt from his and hers, and I'm at a loss for words.'

A person who answered the phone at the West Dallas Highway supermarket declined to comment and would not say if any employees witnessed the horrifying shooting.

Police told WSB the shooting occurred at 5.37 p.m., and that an unidentified woman shot her husband dead on the sidewalk in front of the busy store.

She then used the same firearm to shoot herself dead. It is not clear what kind of gun was used in the slaying.

Local authorities did not immediately respond to multiple MailOnline requests for further comment.
