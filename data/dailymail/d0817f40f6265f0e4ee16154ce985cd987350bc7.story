Karren Brady, 44, pictured in London last night, says going back to work two days after giving birth to her first child is a 'deep regret'

Apprentice star Karren Brady says she feels 'a deep regret' for going back to work just two days after she had her first child.

The successful businesswoman and mother-of-two made the frank admission about her 'pretty hardcore' decision in a television interview to be broadcast tomorrow.

Miss Brady, 44, said she went back to work as managing director of Birmingham Football Club two days after she gave birth to Sophia, now 17, because she 'had a manager to sack'.

When asked by Jonathan Ross if her career success had cost her time spent with her children, Miss Brady said: 'Well, I didn't take much maternity leave, which is a deep regret of mine.

'With Sophie, unfortunately I had a manager to sack, so I had to have my baby on the Wednesday and get up and go and do it on the Friday.

'It was pretty hardcore.'

She is thought to have been referring to former Birmingham City manager Barry Fry, after she sacked him in 1996.

The workaholic, who was handed a CBE for services to entrepreneurship and women in business in this year's New Year honours list, is married to former Birmingham City striker, Canadian Paul Peschisolido.

She took over Birmingham City at the age of 23, had her first child, Sophia, in 1996 when she was 27, and then had son, Paolo, in 1998, when she was 29.

Miss Brady told the chat show host that modern technology had made life easier for working mothers, enabling them to work wherever they are, rather than having to go into an office.

And she joked about being her husband's boss, saying: 'I sold him because I needed the money.

'Most women want to give their husbands away - I managed to get a few quid for mine.'

She also spoke about being diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, or bulging blood vessel, at the age of 36, saying: 'I went and had this five-hour operation and spent a couple of days in intensive care and then I was home.'

Miss Brady added: 'One of the most important things about being ill is actually getting on with your life after it and closing the door and not reflecting on it. I’ve packed it away and I’ve got on with my life. 

'I’ve had the best possible outcome of the operation.  There is life after brain aneurysms, and things go on and, touch wood, I’ve not had a problem with it since.'

Now vice-chairman of West Ham United,
 as well as Lord Sugar's right-hand woman in the Apprentice TV show, 
Miss Brady, who lives in Knowle, Solihull, is an outspoken champion of 
women in business.

She once said: 'If you don't have a woman on your board you should write to your shareholders and explain why.

'Tell
 us how many women you've interviewed and what skills they've been 
lacking, because that will give us some basis to teach the new 
generation of women in business.'

Last year Miss Brady told a Women in the Workplace summit at Downing Street: 'Childcare is the biggest barrier for women in the workplace because if you don’t have high quality affordable childcare, you are not going to leave your children to go to work.

'Most of us won’t leave our children unless we go into a job that respects us, pays us well and give us the opportunity that we want, and if you put a barrier of quality childcare into that, it becomes even more difficult.'

Miss Brady, who previously said the way she handled her maternity leave with Sophia was 'shameful', took longer off after having Paolo.

Speaking previously about the battle to combine work and childcare, she said: 'When Paolo was born I took longer off and worked from home when I could.

'I tried bringing both children to the office but that didn't work out. I had to have full-time help in the end.'

However her views that women should be able to combine work and family are at odds with those of Lord Sugar, who has questioned women's maternity rights.

He said: 'Everything has gone too far.  We have maternity laws where people are entitled to too much.'
