Pregnant Royal Zara Phillips appeared a little pooped as she attended the Cheltenham races yesterday.

The Queen’s 32-year-old granddaughter, who is due to give birth in the New Year, put her hand to her head as she walked around in a beige jumper and winter coat, her baby bump clearly visible.  

Zara watched her husband Mike Tindall’s horse Monbeg Dude come fourth in the Murphy Group Handicap Chase, ridden by her former boyfriend Richard Johnson, 36.

The blonde looked snug in her fur-trimmed hooded cape as she strolled around the Cotswold based racecourse, which was staging its annual three-day Open festival.

The highlight of yesterday's Paddy Power Gold Cup Day saw jockey Richie McLernon claim victory on Johns Sprint, after failing by an inch to win last year's Grand National.

Keen horsewoman Zara was criticised early in her pregnancy for continuing to ride, but recently revealed that she had been forced to give up the sport because it had become too uncomfortable.

Instead the Olympic silver medallist, who is godmother to Prince George, said she had taken up baking.

‘I have been riding, but it’s so uncomfortable. So, yes, I’m baking. I love cooking and will definitely cook for the baby,’ she said last month.

Zara has also said that she plans to return to competition following the birth of her baby, with husband  Mike Tindall, 35.

She even hopes to compete in the World Eventing Championship next August
and will take her baby with her on the eventing circuit – which is what
her mother Princess Anne did after Zara was born.

The couple do not know if the baby is a boy or a girl and Mike said recently: 'We want it to be a surprise. I’m really looking forward to it, but I’m not sure how I’ve prepared. We’ve been pretty relaxed. We’ve not sorted a nursery yet.'

Family matters: Zara, pictured with her husband Mike Tindall, attended Prince George's christening last month, having been named godmother to the Royal baby
