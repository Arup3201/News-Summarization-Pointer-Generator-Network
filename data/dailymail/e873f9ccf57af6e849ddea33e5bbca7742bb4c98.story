These are the amazing scenes when a woman opens up her front door to discover a baby owl standing on her porch. 

The young bird is not afraid of the woman and looks up towards her. 

The owl gently rocks from side to side during the minute-long video in an undetermined location in the United States. 

In the video clip, the two women are clearly captivated by the sight of the owl.

One gushes: 'I just can't believe it. I thought it was a puppy dog, bug it's got claws.' 

She adds: 'I have never been this close to an owl before', to which her equally excited friend replies: 'Me neither'. 

The baby owl, pictured, appeared on the porch of the house and stood on the mat for more than a minute

One of the residents initially mistook the small owl for a little puppy during the one-minute long video

The baby owl gazes up at the woman who excitedly says: 'I have never been this close to an owl before'
