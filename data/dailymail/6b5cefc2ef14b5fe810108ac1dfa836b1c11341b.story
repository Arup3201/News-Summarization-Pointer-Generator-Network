President Obama’s outgoing counselor John Podesta has revealed that his biggest regret in 2014 was his failure to disclose the truth about the existence of UFOs. 

On Friday, Podesta marked the conclusion of his latest stint at the White House by listing on Twitter his top 10 triumphs and failures from the past year.

Among his high points, the 66-year-old law professor listed taking a ride in a NASCAR vehicle, hosting a famous chef at his home, as well as a few more serious accomplishments: the expansion of the Pacific Remote Islands Monument to twice the size of Texas, the first-ever proposal to limit carbon pollution and significant progress on climate change.

A serious man: President Obama’s outgoing counselor John Podesta has revealed that his biggest regret in 2014 was his failure to disclose the truth about the existence of UFOs

Top 10 list: Podesta marked the conclusion of his year-long stint at the White House by listing on Twitter his top triumphs and failures from 2014 

The presidential counselor also had a couple of low points in 2014, including being defeated in a 12K race by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, who is 20 years his junior.

But nothing exasperated Podesta more than keeping Americans in the dark about extra-terrestrials.

'Finally, my biggest failure of 2014: Once again not securing the #disclosure of the UFO files.'

The tweet was accompanied by the hashtag #thetruthisstilloutthere - a play on the famous tagline from the TV show The X-Files.

Podesta, a married father of three who served as Bill Clinton’s final White House chief of staff for four years in the 1990s, has long been fascinated with aliens.

During a 2002 press conference hosted by the Coalition for Freedom of Information, Podesta declared: 'It's time to find out what the truth really is that's out there, reported Yahoo News.

'We ought to do it, quite frankly, because the American people can handle the truth.'

Special interest: The 66-year-old law professor's fascination with UFOs has been well-documented 

In 2010, John Podesta wrote an introduction for the book UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go On the Record.

Now that he is back in the private sector, Podesta is expected to take the reins of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.

While shepherding the president’s climate change agenda and shaping his strategy for dealing with a Republican-led Congress, Podesta has also been involved in nearly every key conversation with Clinton on campaign hires and her burgeoning organization, as well as the timing of a formal announcement of her candidacy.

Obama brought on Podesta after the disastrous rollout of his health care law. Several current and former White House officials said Podesta – regarded by many as an alder statesman - quickly injected more depth into strategy discussions and would often play devil’s advocate, pushing the team to consider things not on their radar.

Podesta also ingratiated himself with Obama’s team, particularly younger aides. An avid cook – his specialty is Italian, including risotto and biscotti – he would invite staffers to his home in Northwest Washington for celebratory dinners after finishing big projects.

On Friday, Podesta tweeted that his biggest culinary feat last year was hosting a dinner for New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman and senior presidential adviser on nutrition policy Sam Kass.

'I let them mince herbs for the risotto. They didn’t screw up,' he quipped.
