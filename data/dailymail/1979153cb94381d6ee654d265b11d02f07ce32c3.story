Suspended: Nurse Julie Cank engaged in a sexual relationship with a patient

A female nurse has been suspended after it was discovered that she had a sexual relationship with a mentally ill patient 19 years her junior.

Julie Cank met the 23-year-old man at her unit at Calderstones Hospital in Whalley, Lancashire and began the relationship after he was discharged.

The 42-year-old has been ordered not to work for 18 months after a fitness to practise hearing was told there was a risk of repetition.

Ms Cank, of Burnley, had worked at Calderstones Hospital for 15 years and admitted that she started having intercourse with the 23-year-old after he moved from the unit to a supervised home.

The man suffers from a personality disorder and was sectioned at the age of 17 after being deemed a risk to the public and to himself.

In a hearing held in Manchester earlier this month, the Conduct and Competence Committee heard that the vulnerable young man also has learning difficulties and needs help with everyday chores such as cooking and dealing with finances.

David Patience of the Nursing and Midwifery Council submitted a statement to the committee saying Ms Cank caused the patient harm, and was at risk of repetition.

The statement said that these are serious allegations which relate to an inappropriate relationship with a vulnerable patient.

The panel heard that Mr Patience submitted that Ms Canks had admitted the allegations and that her misconduct did cause actual patient harm.

‘Mr Patience further submitted that there was a real risk of repetition and, you have told the panel that you are still dealing with a health issue and these health issues have not been resolved and therefore there is a real risk of repetition.

A fitness to practise hearing ruled that Ms Cank should not work as a nurse for 18 months due to the harm caused to the patient and a substantial risk of repetition (picture unrelated)

‘He said that this order should be for 18 months in order to cover any problems that may arise in the re-scheduling of this case.’

The 23-year-old man currently lives in a supported housing scheme, where he receives 30 hours of help per week.

The relationship came to light when the manager of the scheme expressed concern about visits by ‘a woman in her 40s who she believed was a nurse from Calderstones’. 

Ms Cank told the panel that she was not currently working as a nurse, and the panel decided the suspension would not cause any financial hardship.
