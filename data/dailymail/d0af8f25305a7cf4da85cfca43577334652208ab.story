These incredible photos have captured the moment a hungry bird almost drops its dinner, but successfully catches it again mid-air.

The series of snaps were taken at El Dorado Lake in Long Beach, California.

After the carp is snatched from water it almost escapes the beak of the hungry tern bird as they both soar through the air.

After being snatched from the water the carp almost escapes the beak of the hungry tern bird as they both soar through the air

As it's on the cusp of freedom, it is back inside the bird's mouth within moments

But as it's on the cusp of freedom, it is back inside the bird's mouth within moments.

The struggle was caught on camera by American photographer Andrew Lee, 52, of Irvine, California.

He spotted a flock of caspian terns hunting for food close to his Californian home.

'I spotted several terns circling around a particular area of the lake,' says Mr Lee.

'I followed one of them with my camera and suddenly the tern dived into the lake and came up with a big carp.

'I kept following the bird as it flew up with this fish thrashing wildly in his beak.

'The fish was able to break free and for a split second it looked like it was flying through the air, pursued by the tern - it was a precious moment.'

Mr Lee was able to watch from just 60 metres away as the struggle took place.

Spending only ten seconds flying through the air, the carp almost completes his great escape, before he is caught by the tern at the last moment.

The bird continues his journey with the fish securely in his beak

Mr Lee says: 'The tern had a hard time trying to stay in the air as they fish was obviously very heavy for him to try and control.

'He tried to flip the fish over so he could swallow it, head first, and I happened to capture the moment when the fish was flying in the air.

'Most people, including myself, have never seen a flying fish with a tern in hot pursuit behind.

'We were all surprised to see how big the fish was in relation to the tern.

'It was a very special moment to capture and to share, and I would like to share with others the wonders of our beautiful world.'
