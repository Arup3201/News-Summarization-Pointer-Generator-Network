When Kelly and Corey, a young couple from Dee Why in Sydney's northern beaches, missed out on a property at auction on Saturday, Kelly broke down.

'It was hugely disappointing,' said Matt Hunt, the real estate agent selling the property who has been trying to help the couple find a house for the last two years.

Mr Hunt said the home was 'an entry-level home' in North Narrabeen, and sold for just $1,000 more than Kelly and Corey could afford.

'They left the auction here in tears. She was upset, they started walking out and Corey was rubbing her back, she was rubbing her eyes,' Mr Hunt told Daily Mail Australia.

Kelly and Corey, who have not been able to find a property in two years, represent a generation of first-home buyers struggling to make their way into an increasingly difficult Australian property market.

'We are seeing a lot of disappointment,' said Mr Hunt.

A Senate Inquiry into Affordable Housing, taking place tomorrow in Canberra, is investigating the difficulties presented by the conditions of the current property market.

In November 2013, the proportion of first-home buyers purchasing property dipped to the lowest historical level, with only 12.3 percent of all owner-occupied properties bought by first-time buyers.

The drop was most pronounced in New South Wales, where the proportion of first-home buyers dropped from 19.2 percent in 2011 to 7.5 percent in 2013.

Average loan sizes taken out by first home buyers has increased 3.2 percent in the last year, to $302,233, according to the most recent data from the Real Estate Institute Australia's Housing Affordability Report.

Mat and Lexi Hill have been searching for a house since last September and are considering long-term renting because of the high house prices

Mr and Ms Hill attended an auction on Saturday in Sydney's west that was attended by 30 registered bidders and went for more than $300,000 above the advertised price

Lexi and Mat Hill, both 29, have been looking to purchase their first home in Sydney since last September and because of the steep prices, are now facing the prospect of renting long-term, until house prices drop.

'We're looking in suburbs that are or should be affordable,' Ms Hill told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're looking out west, we're not looking in the inner west or the eastern suburbs.'

'Be big and bold, get in early. There's no benefit to holding back at all, some people think it's best to bid on the second hammer and frustrate the other buyers, but the winning formula seems to be the people who get in early,' said Matt Hunt from First National Rod Jones.

'Things will get to the point where the bids go up by $500 and $1,000. People won't continue to keep going if they think they're up against a strong contender.

'Sort out a budget and leave a buffer zone. Buyers are going to have a number they think [the property] is worthy, they should always have a five percent buffer zone if they can afford it.

'Nothing in this market is going to go at a discounted rate. What you feel is market value is where you should come in [with your first bid]â€¦ Coming in at market value can throw off the other buyer.'

Despite this, Ms Hill said houses are going for hundreds of thousands of dollars above their market value.

Last Saturday, Mr and Ms Hill attended an auction for a house in Wentworthville in Sydney's west that was advertised in the mid- $700,000s, with the RP Data property report listing the maximum value for the property as $865,000.

'The opening bid at the auction was $900,000,' said Ms Hill. 'There were about 30 registered bidders there, but there were only four active bidders after that. Everyone was in shock.

'It sold for $1.031 million, it's crazy.'

Ms Hill said experiences like this one were 'shattering', particularly because the couple, who married in April, are ready to settle down.

'But you can't get too attached and that's hard because you want to and you want to settle down and make it your little nest.'

Given the state of the property market, she and her husband are considering long-term renting and other forms of investment.

'We may just have to rent somewhere else but we're not going to be bullied by the market into over-investing and not getting value for money,' she said.

'We're going to find something that's affordable.'
