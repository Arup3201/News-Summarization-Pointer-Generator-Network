A San Francisco area man was arrested Tuesday and charged shooting a 20-year-old college sophomore in the back of the head as the stepped off a train in front of the victim's house.

Justin Valdez was an upbeat sophomore at San Francisco State University on his way home in the Ingleside Heights neighborhood around 9:50 Monday night, officials say.

He shared the train home with 30-year-old Nikhom Thephakaysone, the man who would be arrested the following day for Valdez's cold-blooded and, according to police, random slaying.

Promising: Justin Valdez was an upbeat, 20-year-old environmental activist attending San Francisco State University when police say he was randomly shot in the back of the head by a stranger he shared a train ride with

Suspect: Police released grainy surveillance footage from the San Francisco Muni light-rail train to help find and arrest suspect Nikhom Thephakaysone on Tuesday, a day after Valdez was shot

Thephakaysone is seen in surveillance footage on the Muni, the light-rail train the men shared that night, wearing a black baseball cap and white or grey sweatshirt.

His demeanor is difficult to make out in the grainy footage, but at one point the suspect even appears to smile.

Thephakaysone's arrest came after police released surveillance footage of a suspect taken from the light-rail car and asked for the public's help in identifying him.

He was taken into custody by police on Tuesday outside his home in San Francisco's Oceanside District.

Police told the San Francisco Chronicle the shooting appears to have been a random, unprovoked attack.

Authorities released few other details, but more information will become public at a press conference scheduled for Thursday.

Meanwhile,
friends and family of the victim--who graduated two years ago from 
Garden Grove High School in Southern California--are in shock that the 
promising former environmental club president has become a victim of a 
stranger's hate.

Inspirational: Valdez's former high school principal Steve Osborne said that in their last conversation he told Valdez he hoped his own children one day grew up to be like him

'He was 
one of the most persistently positive kids I ever knew,' Valdez's high 
school principal Steve Osborne told the San Francisco Examiner.

According
to the Examiner, Valdez was an accomplished competitive swimmer and 
water polo player. He was also a passionate environmental advocate and 
conservationist.

Osborne said that in their last conversation, he told Valdez he hopes his own kids grow up to be as upbeat and vigilant.

'Everybody is just devastated,' Osborne said.
