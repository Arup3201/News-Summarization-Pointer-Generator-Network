A mansion guest house which boasts an exterior painted entirely pink and an explosion of flowers and fairy lights inside has recently popped up in Tiptree.

Eaton House's fun and frivolous garden features a unicorn sculpture perched on a bed of pink flowers surrounded by gold heart-shaped stepping stones, a fireplace, hot tub, and pink flamingos.

It is only just completed but the luxury property in the Essex countryside already boasts a stellar list of previous guests including rapper Iggy Azalea, TV foodie Gizzi Erskine and model Felicity Hayward.

Eaton House, the epitome of fun and frivolity, is one of Essex's most luxury guest houses and boats numerous stellar guests

Owners and best friends James Lloyd-Roberts, 45, a firefighter and photographer, and Amy Griffith, 37, an artist, have spent the last four years lovingly crafting the property into their magical vision.

The 13 room boutique home is often hired out as a guest house, studio for photo-shoots and special events venue within the art, fashion and music industries while the owners stay in a garden caravan. 

Eaton House may be
famous for it's excess of pink, but it has several other decor themes 
throughout. Amy has custom-designed each one, painting every wall, hand-making every flower, 
every photo collage and even every table throughout the home.

Themed rooms include the Mansfield Suite (named after actress 
Jayne), which is adorned with lights, antique 
clocks, heart-shaped pillows and trinkets, 'the embodiment of femininity and Hollywood glamour'.

The Quintessential Cowboy themed bedroom is decorated in a Western style and features horns over the bed. The vintage-inspired Riding Room is complete with floral curtains, a dressing table and a wall covered in gilt mirrors.

The Green Parlour features as one of two living areas. It is designed in a modern heritage style 
with fluffy rugs, Louis XIII furnishings, modern photography and an 
antique mirror decorated with stuffed birds.

The second living space is the futuristic Universe Lounge which is lit in blue and features a pool table, Agent Provocateur framed images and a hallway with Hawaiian-themed and gold glitter wallpaper.

The monochrome wet room has a retro feel and is almost completely black and white apart from some pink ornaments.

The project is self-funded but owners would not reveal how much they spent.

'James had the house for 12 years and was telling me he wanted to do something with the place but just wasn’t sure what,' Amy told the Essex Chronicle.

He called on the help of his fellow 
firefighters at Colchester Fire Station, where he has worked for 25 
years, to help paint the outside and plant the garden.

Putting firefighters to further use, 
owners can arrange bespoke treats such as firemen models to serve dinner
or drinks and a fireman bootcamp. An in-house chef and n 
in-house beauty team can also be hired.

It is said to be a popular spot for groups of friends who want to stay there after a party.

To hire the property for two nights' bed and breakfast for up to 12 guests will set you back £2,500. Smoked salmon, eggs, bacon and juice is served in the morning.

Nearby, guests can get a taste of nature and visit the many local attractions including the renowned Tiptree Jam Factory, a nature reserve and bird sanctuary, award winning nursery, the zoo, local farms, or embark on local country walks.
