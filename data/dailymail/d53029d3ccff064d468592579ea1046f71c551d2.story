A popular mayor in Bolivia is facing possible legal action after groping two women, and forcing a kiss on a third, while on camera at official events.

In the most recent incident, Percy Fernandez, Mayor of Santa Cruz, puts his hand on the thigh of a broadcast journalist seated next to him.

There's a brief struggle as the reporter tries to remove the 75-year-old mayor's hand from her leg, before she manages to yank it away and places it on his own thigh.

Brazen: Santa Cruz Mayor Percy Fernandez grabs the thigh of journalist Mercedes Guzman as he speaks during a public event in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. He has been forced to apologise but still faces a legal complaint

Humiliating: In an admirable display of professionalism, Ms Guzman managed to keep smiling as she struggled to remove the 75-year-old mayor's hand from her leg, before yanking it away and placing it on his own thigh

It is the latest episode in a string of inappropriate behaviour, which has included patting a city councillor's bottom as she made a speech, and forcing a kiss on the lips of an engineer at a bridge opening.

Opposition legislator Marcela Revollo Fernandez has filed a complaint in La Paz, the Bolivian capital, accusing Mayor Fernandez of 'sexual harassment, sexual violence, and discrimination.'

As she filed the complaint, Ms Revollo was quoted by CNN as saying: 'We consider this an expression of violence against all Bolivian women, considering that the mayor's actions have happened before.'Â 

Inappropriate behaviour: Mr Fernandez was previously caught on camera stroking the president of the Santa Cruz city council's bottom as she made a speech at a public event in front of news crews and a big audience

Relentless: She was forced to hold his hand in an effort to get him to stop touching her. He promptly kissed it and began rubbing her knuckles with his thumb, before again reaching for her behind

It is not known if prosecutors will call on Mayor Fernandez to answer the charges, which carry a potential punishment of up to four years in prison.

The complaint came shortly before he appeared on television last week to express 'anguish for this mess that's been created.'

He said he had not intended to offend journalist Mercedes Guzman, 'nor have I done so.' He did not specifically apologise for touching her.

Journalists' leader Lupe Cajias

Several legislators, journalists' organizations and women's rights activists denounced the 75-year-old mayor and Ms Guzman's husband, Marco Antonio Espindola, threatened to bring a legal complaint of his own if the mayor did not apologise.

'Even the schoolmates of my son in primary school heard about this event and my adolescent son had to put up with uncomfortable questions at his school,' said Mr Espindola. 'It shamed my family.'

Lupe Cajias, president of the La Paz Association of Journalists, also criticised Mayor Fernandez. She told CNN: 'On one hand, I think it reflects the arrogance of power; and on the other hand, a lack of control of (the mayor's) own actions.

'The two things are probably related. If you think there's no boundaries because you're above good and evil, then you can grab a journalist's leg or talk with double-meaning in front of the camera without shame.'

The blunt-spoken Fernandez has run into controversy before for his treatment of women. In 2012, he was filmed running his hands over President of the city council's bottom as she made a speech during a ceremony.

She was forced to hold his hand in an effort to get him to stop touching her. He promptly kissed it and began rubbing her knuckles with his thumb, before again reaching for her behind.

At another event, he planted a lengthy kiss on a seemingly unwilling female engineer.

Fernandez has been mayor of the city of more than 1 million several times and has lately supported President Evo Morales, who in February called him the country's best mayor.
