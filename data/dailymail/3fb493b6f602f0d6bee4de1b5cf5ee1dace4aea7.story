A child rapist in Bali who repeatedly attacked a 14-year-old girl, leaving her pregnant, has had his sentence reduced... because he offered to marry his victim.

Komang Aditya Pratama, 19, was jailed for just 18 months in Denpasar today despite being convicted of a crime that usually carries a prison term of up to 15 years.

He was arrested in February after the family of the girl, who is now seven months pregnant, reported him to police for raping her on several 
occasions last year.

Anger: The decision to jail Komang Aditya Pratama for just 18 months rather than 15 years has angered women and child protection groups in Bali (pictured: a separate anti-rape protest on the island)

But today judge Dewa Puspa Adnyana handed down the lenient sentence on account of his 'goodwill offer'  to marry the victim and 'be responsible for the baby' - a proposition that the girl's family has rejected.

The judge also took into account the fact that he had no criminal record and had 'promised not to repeat the offense.'

Adding
 to further commotion in the court, a brother of the victim walked up to
 the judge's table and questioned the leniency of the sentence.

There
 were further angry scenes when Aditya was mobbed by members of the 
victim's family when he was escorted from the court to complete his 
prison sentence.

Lenient: The Kerobokan jail (pictured) in Denpasar is one of Indonesia's most notorious prisons. Aditya will only serve a tenth of the term Indonesian law prescribes for rapists

Women and child protection groups are outraged at the 'completely inappropriate' sentence, and have accused the judge for failing to uphold the spirit of the child protection laws.

'This is not right at all and completely inappropriate,' Siti Sapura, an activist from the Denpasar Child Protection Institute, or LPA, who has followed the case from the beginning, told the Jakarta Globe

What has stunned the activists further is the decision by the judge to break the law by allowing journalists to sit in on the case when it should have been heard behind closed doors.

Before the hearing in the island's capital, Denpasar, the judge told reporters who had asked if they could cover the case: 'OK, you can stay - but don't crowd the place.'

Prosecutors said they will not mount an appeal for a longer sentence.
