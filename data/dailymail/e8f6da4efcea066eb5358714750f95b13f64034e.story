Good Morning America host Amy Robach has revealed that the memory loss she suffered from her recent eight rounds of chemotherapy was so profound, to this day she can't remember much of her time on air.

The 40-year-old mother-of-two, who continued to appear on her ABC show for the duration of her entire eight month ordeal, admits she was often 'afraid' she would 'do or say something stupid' on air, such were the cognitive effects of her treatment.

'The chemo brain, the chemo fog, is a real thing,' she told The New York Daily News. 'I would have conversations with people, they would take pictures with me after the show... it upset me tremendously because I actually wouldnâ€™t be able to remember.'

Brave front: Amy Robach, pictured on Good Morning America in February while undergoing intense chemotherapy, says she still can't remember filming many of her segments due to the 'chemo fog'

Ms Robach points to one occasion on which she was filming a segment about hit AMC show Mad Men, and was dressed in 1960s attire. The following day, when she saw photos of her unusual outfit, she says it 'bought tears' to her eyes because she no recollection of any of it.

In another instance, her husband of four years, actor Andrew Shue, wrote her a 'beautiful' letter after she underwent her first round of chemotherapy, which she read and then promptly forgot about.

'For me those were very, very difficult moments,' she says. 'Because you just realize the impact of what is being pumped inside of you and you feel so incredibly vulnerable, physically, mentally.

And those were the days I was just so afraid of what was happening to me.'

Still, Ms Robach soldiered on, finding solace in the distractions of the job she 'loves,' and drawing strength from staying on air to prove that she could 'overcome her fears.'

Following her shock diagnoses in October of last year, she turned to co-host and fellow breast cancer survivor, 53-year-old Robin Roberts, for support.

Ms Roberts, who helped persuade Ms Robach to undergo the routine on-air mammogram in the first place - an action that would later 'save her life' - advised her to have her chemo sessions on Thursdays, because her 'worst days' would be over the weekend, leaving her enough recovery time to be 'halfway decent' for work on Mondays.

Of these dreaded treatment sessions, Ms Robacah said: 'Those moments in the chemo rooms were very intense for me. When I was in that room, in that chair, I broke down every time.

'I was mad that there were toxins surging through my body, I was mad that I felt like I was gonna vomit and that I was losing my memory'

'The rest of the time I could kind of pretend and forget... I was mad there was a needle in my arm, I was mad that there were toxins surging through my body, I was mad that I felt like I was gonna vomit and that I was losing my memory.'

Ms Robach also touched on the negative attention she received from some outlets which claimed she was holding back certain details of her diagnosis from the public, and compromising her journalistic 'ethics' in discussing other aspects on television; accusations she says 'makes steam come out of [her] ears.'

The news anchor mentions eight instances in which women have written to her, thanking her for inspiring them to get themselves checked and ultimately catching cancer sooner than they otherwise would have done.

She also recalls the day, soon after her first scans, when her insurance company informed her they wouldn't be paying the $800 for her next round of imaging because they didn't consider it 'necessary.'

Thankfully, she paid the fee herself and she says she is 'lucky' she was able to, although this wouldn't have always been the case.

'There were times in my life that that could have been my rent money, that could have been the money I would need to spend on groceries,' she admits.

'How many millions of Americans would just at that point say thanks but no thanks?... Because treating cancer is an expensive undertaking and I know how it financially destroys families.'

She says she now wants to get involved with organizations that assist families with financial barriers to their health options.

Journey: Ms Robach was open with her fans throughout her ordeal, pictured counting down her eight chemo sessions, which she completed on April 24

Ms Robach has been very transparent with fans and viewers about her cancer battle, right from the moment it began; when, last October, her routine mammogram revealed she had a malignant tumor in her right breast.

It was only after she had her first surgery - a double mastectomy in November - that doctors realized there was a second tumor in the same breast and some abnormal cells in the left breast.

After the surgery it also became clear that the disease had spread to her sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that the mastectomy was far from the final step.

Due to the location and size of the tumors, surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that were placed where the removed breasts once were.

The expanders stayed in place behind the chest muscle in an effort to stretch it out before implants were put in during a second surgery, which took place earlier this month.

Family focused: Ms Robach has two daughters - 11-year-old Ava and eight-year-old Annalise - with her ex-husband Tim McIntosh and three stepsons with her current husband Andrew Shue

Sharing her journey with fans every step of the way, she celebrated the end of her chemo treatment on April 24 by posting a collage of photographs from the past six months depicting her counting down with her fingers the number of sessions she'd had.

'Today is my final round of chemotherapy,' she tweeted. 'I wanted to share this moment with you to encourage anyone facing this battle.'
