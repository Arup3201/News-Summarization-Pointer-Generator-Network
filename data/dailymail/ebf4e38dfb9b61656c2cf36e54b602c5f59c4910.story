Dr David Glowacki, a Research Fellow at the Royal Society, was ejected from the Bristol Old Vic

A leading scientist was kicked out of a classic music concert after trying to crowd surf during a performance of Handel’s Messiah, it has emerged.

Dr David Glowacki, a Research Fellow at the Royal Society and visiting professor at the prestigious Stanford University in the US, was ejected from the Bristol Old Vic after getting ‘overexcited’ during the performance.

His apparent crowd surfing came as audience members were encouraged to move towards the front of the stage with their drinks and ‘clap or whoop when you like’ by the theatre’s artistic director, Tom Morris.

However, while the crowd were warned not to ‘shush other people’, Mr Morris said the respected chemist got ‘very excited’ during the Hallelujah Chorus.

Witnesses claim he was lurching from side to side with his hands raised and whooping before attempting to crowd-surf, The Independent reported.

Apparently irritated by the commotion, audience members attempted to eject the professor from the main arena.

Mr Morris, who directed War Horse at the National Theatre, told The Independent: ‘The Bristol Proms are contributing to a ground-breaking way of thinking which will pave the way for a new kind of classical concert.

‘But by allowing an audience to respond in whatever way they want, you also allow an audience to self-regulate, as we discovered.’

However, Dr Glowacki, who said he was not
 under the influence of alcohol, defended his actions and accused both 
Morris and the audience members of hypocrisy in only approving the right
 sort of 'free' behaviour.

He told the newspaper: ‘Classical 
music, trying to seem cool and less stuffy, reeks of some sort of 
fossilised art form undergoing a midlife crisis.'

Several ticket holders have since 
urged Mr Morris to stipulate an official ban on crowd surfing.

He said while 
he does not wish to impose strict rules, he would not 
tolerate crowd surfing during classical concerts.

The performance of Handel's Messiah, launched by Mr Morris as a more 'accessible and informal' alternative to classical music, forms part of this year's Bristol Proms.
