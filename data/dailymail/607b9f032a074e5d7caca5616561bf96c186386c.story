A brave toddler who needed 70 percent of her lung cut out after being born with a rare congenital condition has started nursery despite now facing the removal of a diseased kidney.

Two-year-old Emily Norris, of Bowthorpe, Norwich, required the emergency surgery after a chest infection in 2012 and the illness has now spread to her right kidney. 

But amazingly - the resilient toddler, described by her mother as 'incredible' and 'a ball of energy' recently attended her first day at Costessey Pre-School in Norwich.

Her mother, Nicki Pybus, 26, said: 'Emily's absolutely fantastic - we're all so proud of her. Starting school is a huge step forward. 

'Giving Emily her own little bit of independence is scary in a way - but seeing her go to Costessey Pre-School and loving it is amazing.' 

Ms Pybus was first made aware of complications during a 20-week pregnancy scan - when doctors noticed a mass on the baby's lung and advised her to consider termination. 

She added: ''That was never an option for me. I thought it was down to her - if she wanted to be born and wanted to thrive then that was up to her.'

Despite the mass on her lung, Emily was remarkably born without complications and was able to breathe perfectly..

But when she turned four months old and picked up a chest infection she was rushed into hospital on Boxing Day 2012. 

Ms Pybus said: 'They said there were cysts on her lung and in the end they spread to take up 70 per cent of her right lung. 

'She was admitted to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital for two and a half weeks, then sent home. 

Rare illness: Emily was born with a congenital condition affecting her right lung - 70 per cent of which has had to be removed 

'But the cysts grew so much she went from being monitored to doctors saying the mass needed to come out.' 

Emily had been struck down by the very rare condition congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. 

The stricken infant was transferred to London's world-renowned Great Ormond Street Hospital to have the diseased slice of her lung removed. 

During the two weeks in hospital, Ms Pybus had to leave her older children, Jake, seven, and Dominic, three, with her family. 

The Sick Children's Trust gave the panicked mother a place to stay near to the hospital so she could be by her daughter's side while she battled the illness.

First day: The toddler recently had her first day at at Costessey Pre-School in Norwich - but sadly her illness has spread to her right kidney, which will also have to be removed

While the mass on Emily's lung was big enough to be picked up on early scans, the cysts on her right kidney were only discovered later - news that devastated Emily's family. 

Ms Pybus said: 'She will have to have her kidney removed as well. Doctors said they had seen the condition before, but they had never seen it happen to two organs in the same person. 

'But for a child that has been through so much Emily's just so happy and smiley.

'She smiles at all the doctors and nurses at the hospital, even though they are going to prod and poke her. 

'She gets out of breath and we will have to watch out when she's more active, but by the time she's at high school, her lung should be able to compensate. 

'Emily's just incredible. She's a little ball of energy, but I constantly worry. 

'No matter how well she's doing, there's always something to worry about. There's a constant "what if?" and there always will be but she's got this far and she's doing ever so well.'
