Lots of little girls dream of one day wearing the perfect wedding dress.

But when six-year-old Hannah  Millington-Day designed this  elegant ivory number, she was thinking about eating it.

She came up with the idea for a life-sized, edible bridal gown when she saw a picture of her mother’s wedding dress.

Donna Millington-Day and her daughter Hannah - who challenged her mother to create this life sized wedding cake - add the final touches

A sweet treat: The six-foot edible bridal gown is made from 17 tiers of sponge cake, 22 kilos of sugar paste icing and 2lb of royal icing

A feast for all: Decorated from hundreds of sugar pearls, the cake would cater for over 2,000 wedding guests

Then it was down to her mother Donna, a confectioner, to bake it.

She used a whopping 224 free-range eggs, 28lb of flour, 28lb of caster sugar and 28lb of butter, and spent a whole week cooking.

The result – worth £6,000 – is 6ft 
tall and made of 17 tiers of sponge cake. It is topped with 49lb of 
sugar paste icing, 2lb of royal icing and hundreds of sugar pearls.

It is filled with 17lb of Madagascan vanilla butter cream and around 7lb of raspberry jam.

And it could feed as many as 2,000 guests – if anyone can bring themselves to cut into it.

Mrs Millington-Day, 36, said: ‘Hannah
 was going through my old wedding photos when she suggested we recreate 
my dress. I thought it was a great idea.

‘Although it’s not an exact replica I have taken the details like the corset and styling on the side.

Creator: Donna Millington-Day was inspired by her six-year-old daughter's drawing of a wedding dress cake

Challenge: Donna decided to rise to the challenge of bringing her daughter's design to life and one week later the stunning ivory dress heavily embellished with iced flowers and weighing in at 25 kilos was finished

‘The satin finish was achieved using a pearl lustre and each swirl was hand-piped.’
  Mrs Millington-Day runs the Fairytale Cake Company with her husband of eight years, Myles.

The couple, of Wombourne,  Staffordshire, also have a son Edward, aged two.

The enormous sweet treat was unveiled yesterday at the start of the National Wedding Show at the NEC in Birmingham.

To get it there, a trolley was  custom-made to fit its 30in base.

But it won’t be on the move too 
often. Mrs Millington-Day said: ‘We’re not going to sell the cake, but 
to buy it would cost around £6,000.

‘After the show we’re going to display it in our shop window.’
