Harry Redknapp has told QPR chairman Tony Fernandes to sign him some strikers after his side were beaten 2-0 by Red Bull Leipzig.

The London side started solidly, with debutant Rio Ferdinand guiding them to a first-half clean sheet.

However, Ferdinand was withdrawn at  half-time and QPR were punished when Yussuf Poulsen struck twice. After the match, Redknapp made it clear he wants players to compete with forwards Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin.

‘We are still short, we have two strikers,’ Redknapp said. ‘We have Bobby and Charlie but it is taking time. Hopefully in the next week or so we can put that right.

‘We’re trying to get things done. You can’t go into a season with two strikers.’

Watford’s Troy Deeney is being targeted to improve the club’s firepower, but Redknapp also wants to remodel his midfield, with Leroy Fer of Norwich top of his list.

Redknapp also wants a playmaker after Adel Taarabt was left out of the pre-season tour and linked with moves to Milan and Juventus.

‘We need a bit of quality, it is going to  be a tough division this year. We need that little bit of quality to keep  us in there.’
