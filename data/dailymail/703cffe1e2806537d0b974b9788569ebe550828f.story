Hurricane Fly will try to extend his 4-2 advantage in clashes with Jezki when the pair go head to head in Sunday’s BHP Insurances Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown.

Hurricane Fly, who boasts an unbeaten nine-race record at Leopardstown, will surpass the record of the great Istrabraq if he can win the Irish Champion Hurdle for a fifth time.

The Willie Mullins-trained 11-year-old is also chasing his 22nd success at Grade One level.

He has beaten Jezki, winner of Britain’s Champion Hurdle last March, on both his runs this season, most recently with a half-length success in the Ryanair Hurdle at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting.

In last year’s Irish Champion, Hurricane Fly and jockey Ruby Walsh were over three lengths in front of fourth-placed Jezki and AP McCoy.

Other entries for the race includes Mullins-trained Arctic Fire plus Plinth and Tiger Roll, both of whom were well beaten in the Ryanair.

Mullins is expected to run highly-rated Un De Sceaux in the Grade One Frank Ward Solicitors Arkle Novices’ Chase on the same card. Up against him should be Enda Bolger’s Gilgamboa, winner of both his novice chases.
