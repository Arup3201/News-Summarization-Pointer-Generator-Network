A woman arrested on charges of murder after allegedly throwing her autistic son off of a bridge had recorded a video just last year talking about how hard it was to raise her challenged child and her desire to 'pull a Thelma and Louise.'

Jillian McCabe, 34, of Seal Rock, Oregon, was taken in after authorities discovered the body of her son London in Oregon's Yaquina Bay just hours after a woman called 911 Monday evening to say she had thrown her son off of a bridge.

She has been charged with aggravated murder and first-degree manslaughter.

Now, family members close to Jillian describe the young mother as mentally unstable, and old videos and blog posts written by the woman seem to highlight her difficulties raising a child with severe autism. 

Family members say her downward spiral began soon after her father died and her husband, Matt, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

'I'm sorry but to wake up one day and your whole world is topsy turvy in a world that already was topsy turvy with our son,' Jillian said of the situation in a 2013 video.

'All of a sudden, my husband who was your provider, the caregiver, my captain Kirk, and its hard to talk to him, and everything's hard.'

In that same video, which she recorded and posted to thank her friends and people who were supporting her and her family financially after Matt lost his job, Jillian said; 'Matt and I love you guys. ... If we don't know you, we still love you. You are making this experience livable versus us pulling a Thelma and Louise, which I have totally thought about.'

Other videos on her YouTube page show London throwing coins into a fountain, playing with his iPod on a hammock, and visiting his father in the hospital. 

Woman on the verge: Now, family members are saying Jillian (above in her mugshot) was mentally unstable

Tanya McCabe, London's great-aunt, told NBC News, 'Jillian really struggled with her mental health and I know she was just out of her mind when this happened.'

She added, 'It was terrible what we went through to get her the help she did get. We worked full-time to get her the services but obviously they weren't sufficient.'

Tanya also said how shocked and heartbroken she was to find out what happened to London.

'Jillian was always so patient with him, and loving. She really had a lot of compassion for his condition,' she said. 

'When he was screaming at the top of his lungs, which was the only way he could communicate, she didn't get upset at all. She would calmly comfort him, and I was amazed at how patient she was.'

London's uncle, Andrew McCabe, also cites Jillian's mental instability as the cause of this horrific tragedy, saying; 'The state of health care in the country and the lack of prioritization that we have especially for our mentally ill is appalling. And its heartbreaking and unfortunately there’s tragic results when people don’t get the help they need.'

“She took him for a walk and did what she did,” he added. 

Jillian, who was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, murder, and first degree manslaughter, is being held on $750,000 bail.

The Newport Police Department said that Jillian McCabe had been located near the bridge and interviewed by detectives prior to the discovery of her son's body 

Her first hearing will be on November 12.
