Yaya Toure said Manchester City’s victory over city rivals United is crucial for their confidence after a difficult week.

Toure, man of the match in City’s 1-0 win against the 10 men of United, said it was crucial for his team to ‘bounce back’, and admitted things were beginning to get frustrating after chances, and penalty appeals, went begging at the Etihad.

But Sergio Aguero’s goal decided the game, and City showed strength to hold out.

‘Today we proved we are a strong,’ said Toure after the game. ‘After the Capital One Cup defeat we needed to bounce back, and we did.

‘I think in the first half mine (appeal) is definitely a penalty, but it's tough for the ref to judge and anyone can make a mistake.’

Toure’s captain, Vincent Kompany, suggested that the constant penalty appeals, and City’s inability to double their lead, led to them going into their shell in the closing stages.

Marcos Rojo had to be stretchered off for Manchester United as their defensive woes increased 

'There's no real explanation for it (why we faded away),’ he said. ‘They played well towards the end. We had most of the chances. When you miss them you start to lose confidence.’

‘Ultimately we stood strong, it's a clean sheet and a good derby win. A derby win is massive. Today, The league doesn't matter, and everything else doesn't matter.’
