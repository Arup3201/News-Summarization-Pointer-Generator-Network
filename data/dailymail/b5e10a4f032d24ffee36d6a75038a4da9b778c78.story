'Drugged': Yemeni prisoner Samir Naji

A Guantanamo Bay inmate has described how he is still being subjected to horrific treatment at the notorious jail despite being cleared for release four years ago.

Samir Naji told how he had been drugged, threatened with rape and forced to watch videos of other detainees being abused at the prison in Cuba which Barack Obama has promised – but so far failed – to close down.

The Yemeni has been imprisoned for nearly 13 years after being accused of serving in Osama bin Laden’s security detail. He was cleared for release in 2009 but remains in the US detention facility with 135 other inmates.

Mr Naji released a first-person account of his experience inside Guantanamo through his lawyers.

He said he was subjected to ‘dirty and sadistic’ abuse by guards who took turns trampling over his back and forced him to watch pornography, which is against his Islamic beliefs.

The inmate wrote that his story ‘starts and ends in the silence of a tiny, freezing cold cell, alone’.

His account, published by CNN, continued: ‘The cell door opens. The next session, seemingly the 100th in a row. I think my first period of interrogation lasted three full months.

'Two teams of interrogators running shifts, day and night. Each session begins with shouting, to wake me up. Then they hit me on the face and the back. I am so desperate for sleep, my head is swimming.’

Mr Naji described how the room he was in had photographs of faces stuck to the walls. ‘They demand that I identify the individuals, but I can barely focus to see if I might know them.

‘The shouting and the insults get louder, and then they nod to a man in the corner. He injects me twice in the arm with some unknown substance. It’s the last thing I know.’

The inmate also described how the guards had entered his cell, ‘making awful honking noises, like wild animals’. He added: ‘I tried to refuse to eat the little food they bring me, in protest at all this.

'The interrogator laughs at me, but then turns angry; he swears loudly, and pours an army meal pack over my head. They tell the man in the corner to start feeding me intravenously. He inserts the tube in two different places on my arm and makes it bleed.’

Mr Naji continued: ‘The cell door opens. This time the guards push me on the floor and take turns trampling over my back.

‘I tell the interrogators that I can’t face not eating any more. They throw food on the floor of the room and tell me to eat like a pig. They won’t let me go to the restroom. They watch as it gets more painful, and laugh as they get the translator to describe how they will rape me if I pee in my pants.’

On another occasion, he said, the guards took him to ‘a sort of cinema room’. He added: ‘I have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused.

Inmates were made to stand in stress positions, and some were waterboarded and 'rectally infused'

'Then they tell me that I have to dance for them, and run in circles whilst they pull on my chains. Every time I try and refuse, they touch me in my most private areas.’

Mr Naji said that four years ago, his case had been reviewed by six US security agencies. ‘Their conclusion? That I was innocent of any crime and should be released.

‘America cannot keep hiding from its past, and its present, like this. Our stories, and our continued detention, cannot be made to disappear.’
