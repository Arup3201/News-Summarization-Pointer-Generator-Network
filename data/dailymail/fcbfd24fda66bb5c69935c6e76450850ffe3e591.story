Residents of a cul-de-sac claim their lives are being plagued by a continuous buzzing noise which is causing them to fall ill and making it impossible to sleep.

The sound has been swarming Clay Place in Acomb, North Yorkshire, for more than a month - and despite daytime traffic numbing the buzz, the silence of the night makes it almost unbearable.

Some residents believe the noise - which switches on and off every few seconds - is from nearby mobile phone masts, or newly installed streetlights in an adjacent street.

Paul Croft, 61, who lives on the street with his 48-year-old wife Keiko, said: ‘We went away on holiday at the beginning of December and when we came back, we noticed the sound.

‘It's been keeping us awake every night - sometimes we only get an hour's sleep, and as Keiko doesn't work, she has no break from it, and it's making her ill.

‘She collapsed at the doctor's last week out of sheer exhaustion. It is literally driving us crazy.’

Mr Croft, a former BT engineer who now works in the company's complaints department, added: ‘We have got a device which can monitor sound waves, but it doesn't pick much up in the house.

‘On Saturday night, we went out into the street and the machine was picking up strong microwaves.

‘There are several mobile phone transmitters nearby, which I think are responsible, because they're due to start transmitting 4G signals soon.

‘Also, they have recently installed new streetlights nearby, which could well be emitting these waves, which we're hearing at home.

‘There's only one more traditional yellow-light street lamp on our street and so that would explain why the monitor won't pick anything up at our home.’

Fearing for their health: Mr and Mrs Croft say the buzzing on their road is making it impossible to sleep

Other residents on the street have 
complained of tinnitus-type symptoms with their hearing. Tanya Rostron, 46, 
lives next door to the Crofts with her 13-year-old son.

She said: ‘I first noticed it about six weeks ago, but it 
seems to have got worse and it's becoming unbearable. It's a lot worse 
at night - it's just a constant buzz.

‘It
 might stop for two seconds but then it's back and there's no let-up. It
 sounds louder upstairs and it's really aggravating. I only moved in 
July but I've only just noticed it.

'I was relieved when I heard about Paul and Keiko because I did start to think we were going mad. There's only four houses on the street but we all seem to be affected. I'm not working at the moment because I'm off-sick, but it's not helping my health at all.’

The Crofts have contacted the City of York Council's noise pollution teams, who have left monitoring devices in their home.

The Environmental Protection Unit is now analysing recording made at the house, and has visited at night to listen to the noise.

Mr Croft said: ‘We have been switching from room-to-room at night to try and get rid of the noise.

‘We've tried sleeping on the floor as you can hear it more when you put your head on the pillow and we've swapped bedrooms, but nothing's helped.

‘We don't know where to go with it now, we need someone to help us and someone to shed some light on what this could be.’

The road's four properties are worth between £90,000 and £145,000, with one sold last September.
