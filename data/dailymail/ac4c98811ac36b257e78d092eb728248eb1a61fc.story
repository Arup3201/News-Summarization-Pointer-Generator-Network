Unexpected arrival: Shawna Uriguen, pictured with fiance Clay Crown, delivered her own baby as she drove to the doctors

An Idaho woman has given birth while driving to a doctor appointment, delivering her daughter by herself.

Shawna Uriguen, 29, delivered the six-pound, seven-ounce baby Tuesday while she driving from work to a doctor's appointment.

She was on the phone with her fiance, Clay Crown, 36, and said she was trying to find a place to pull over when the baby was born.

'I was at the stoplight in Heyburn, 
and I was on the phone with my fiancé and I told him, "I think the 
baby’s here." I heard the baby crying, and I was still driving because I
 was trying to find a spot to stop safely and pull off the road without 
blocking traffic,' she told the Times-News.

Uriguen, 29, said she had been having contractions but didn't think she was in labor.

The baby, who the couple has named Kimber Marie Crown, was due on Saturday.

'She had a couple of mild contractions
 that kind of took her breath away, but she was able to breathe through 
them. And then she had a big one and said, "I think the baby is in my 
pant leg." I told her to put the baby on her chest and just tried to 
keep her calm,' said Crown, a former volunteer emergency medical 
technician.

Uriguen said she quickly got the baby out of her pant leg and checked to make sure she was OK.

Medics arrived within minutes, and she was taken to the hospital to get checked out.

Uriguen said she and the baby are fine.

The couple are already parents to two older children.
