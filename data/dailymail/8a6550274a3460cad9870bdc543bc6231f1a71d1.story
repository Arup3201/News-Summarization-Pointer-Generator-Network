Detectives hunting the hospital insulin poisoner yesterday arrested a male nurse as it emerged that a fourth patient has died in suspicious circumstances.

They arrested a 46-year-old, named by sources as Victorino Chua, at his Stockport home, before revealing that another death – that of 82-year-old Bill Dickson on New Year’s Eve – was also being investigated as part of the inquiry.

The dramatic development came after staff at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, reported that a patient had been given the wrong medicine on Monday evening and his medical notes tampered with.

The fourth patient to die after being poisoned with saline was former Manchester Evening News journalist Bill Dickson

The patient was unharmed but police were immediately contacted.

Police sources last night stressed 
that there was not yet any link between the arrest and the contamination
of saline drips at the hospital last summer.

But it is understood the man worked on the same acute care wards at the 
time the patients died and had previously been spoken to by officers as 
part of their complex inquiry.

Last night, the suspect remained in police custody and was being
questioned on suspicion of unlawfully administering or 
causing a person to take a noxious substance, or poison.

Today, a spokesman for Unison, the public sector trade union, confirmed Mr Chua is a member.

His arrest comes four months after nurse Rebecca Leighton, 27, who spent
six weeks in  jail accused of the poisonings, was released due to lack 
of evidence.

Police believe as many as 20 patients were deliberately poisoned when 
saline solutions were injected with insulin on wards A1, A2 or A3 – 
which care for seriously ill patients – between June 1 and July 15  last
year.

16 other patients are believed to have been poisoned at Stepping Hill hospital

Officers are continuing to probe the deaths of multiple sclerosis 
sufferer Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, and 
Mr Dickson, a former senior Daily Mail journalist, who all died after 
suffering ‘hypoglycaemic episodes’ – a dangerous drop in blood sugar 
levels.

Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney, of Greater Manchester 
Police, said: ‘This is, and always has been, a search for the truth.

‘It is due to the diligence of staff at the hospital that we were made 
aware about the potential tampering of medical records and everyone 
should be reassured that, like the hospital, we initiated a swift 
response and have consequently arrested a member of staff in relation to
this matter.

‘I must stress that at this time he is only being spoken to in relation 
to these matters and, as we have previously said, we will not and cannot
rule out making further arrests in the coming days or weeks.’

The man arrested was held after another nurse noticed that medical 
records of a patient on Ward A3 had been altered overnight between 
January 2 and 3.

The patient was given medicine he should not have received but was 
carefully monitored once the error was realised and later discharged.

It was unclear last night whether the man arrested was the same male 
nurse reportedly spoken to by officers last year when his fingerprints 
were discovered on damaged packets of saline solution.

Since the scandal broke in July extra security measures have been put in
place at the hospital, including CCTV in some treatment rooms, two 
additional nurses assigned for the preparation and handling of drugs and
security guards on 24-hour watch outside the wards affected.

The case against Rebecca Leighton was dropped after she was investigated over the deaths of three patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport

Chris Burke, chief executive of Stockport NHS Foundation Trust, which 
runs the hospital, said he was ‘appalled by the malicious intent’ in the
latest incident.

He added: ‘Thanks to the skill and experience of our 
staff it was spotted and reported immediately, and most importantly we 
ensured no patient suffered any ill-effects.

‘This criminal act does not reflect on the good care provided by 
dedicated and committed staff and the effective working practices in our
hospital. The safety of our patients remains our highest priority.’

Police have been at pains to stress the complexity of the investigation 
into the poisonings, which has seen them interview more than 650 people,
including doctors, nurses and pharmacy staff.

Despite all criminal 
charges being dropped against Miss Leighton, she was subsequently sacked
after she admitted stealing opiate-based drugs from the hospital.

Mr Dickson was a former news editor at the Daily Mail. He joined in 1956
and rose to become news editor of the North before leaving for the 
Manchester Evening News in 1971.

Mr Dickson retired from journalism in 
1991. His youngest son Drew, 42, also a journalist, remembered his 
father as a ‘very funny’ man. He added: ‘None of his colleagues ever had
a bad word to say about him.’

Mr Dickson is survived by his wife, Jean, 80, their three children – Craig, 55, Kathy, 53 and Drew – and three grandchildren.
