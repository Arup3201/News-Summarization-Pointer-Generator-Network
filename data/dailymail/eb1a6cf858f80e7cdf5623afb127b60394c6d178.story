It was meant as a small token of appreciation to mark 33 years of tireless service from a longstanding BBC employee.

But the broadcaster's bosses did not take kindly when a colleague tried to treat legendary football commentator Brian Arrundale to a £36.65 bottle of champagne on his retirement.

The corporation refused to sign off the expenses claim - which equated to little more than £1 for every year of work - made by senior broadcast journalist Paul Addison.

Falling flat: The BBC has been accused of a lack of common sense after refusing to pay for a Champagne gift for retiring commentator Brian Arrundale, pictured front left celebrating with colleagues

The BBC's rather ungracious and mean-spirited treatment
has provoked a backlash from staff, with Mr Addison accusing senior 
executives of a lack of common sense.

He said: 'The end of the football season marked the end of an era for BBC Tees Sport.

'Our Hartlepool United commentator Brian Arrundale retired after 33 years of following the team, home and away.

'To mark the occasion - I wanted to 
make him feel special - I bought a magnum of champagne (£36.65 - on 
special offer - a third off at Sainsbury's) to present to him at the end
of an hour-long interview about his time with us.

'As you can imagine, Brian was thrilled.

'I was rather less so when I came to 
claim for the champers - it was refused on these grounds: '1.5.3 Gifts 
for artists and contributors: If there is a valid business reason, gifts
such as flowers (but not champagne) may be given to talent and the cost
must be reclaimed through expenses.'

'So I couldn't reward a valued 
contributor with a bottle of fizz that equated to approximately £1 for 
every year of his service to the BBC.

'Can we not apply some common sense to the policy?

'I understand why we can't be seen to
be spending vast amounts on champagne (although flowers appear to be 
fair game) but £36.65 doesn't seem too extreme.'

The BBC decided to implement a ban on champagne after provoking a storm of criticism when it emerged that between 2007 and 2011 it splashed out on 9,000 bottles of champers, spending a total of £103,667 on bubbly.

The vast sums included £200 on a bottle of Krug Vintage and more than £1,000 on 11 bottles of Dom Perignon.

During a five-year period, the BBC got through an average of 690 bottles of wine, 150 bottles of champagne or sparkling wine and 1,417 bottles or cans of beer or cider every month

On one occasion, BBC staff splashed out £200 on a single bottle of premium champagne: Krug Vintage 1995

It imposed a blanket ban on staff buying champers in 2012 - with none at all claimed on expenses by staff last year.

Mr Arrundale retired in April this year after commentating for BBC Tees on every Hartlepool United game - home and away - for the past 33 years.

The commentator had devoted his working life to the Beeb covering matches for the League Two team since 1980.

Mr Arrundale was honoured by the club when he retired earlier this year by former Hartlepool midfielder Brian Honour, who played for Hartlepool 393 times between 1995 and 2005.

Mr Honour said in April this year: 'He's wonderful fella and he's got a real love for Pools.

'It's sad that he'll no longer be commentating on the games on the radio but you can bet he'll be keeping a keen interest in the club so it's great that they've given him a Season Ticket.

'He's become part of the fixtures and fittings at The Vic so it will be strange not seeing him in the press box or hearing him on the radio but I wish him all the best in his retirement.'

A BBC source said today: 'The ban on champagne was imposed after 9,000 odd bottles were bought in five years, but that was mainly for lovvies and big bosses trading bottles with each other.

'This guy has been working here for more than 30 years and deserves something for his devotion. OK, he got the champagne, but the poor sod who bought him it is out of pocket.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'In the interests of delivering value for money for the licence fee payer we do not buy champagne for departing contributors or staff.

'Departments often arrange collections for contributors or employees who are leaving the BBC.'
