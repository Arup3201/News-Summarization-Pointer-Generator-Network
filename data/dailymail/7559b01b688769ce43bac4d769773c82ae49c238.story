Scott Sinclair is acutely aware the last two years have seen him pictured more frequently perusing the shops of Manchester alongside his famous girlfriend than on the pitch.

He hopes his move to Aston Villa will redress that balance, beginning with Sunday's trip to Arsenal. Sinclair is bursting to remind people of his talent, of those performances for Swansea that earned him an £8million move to Manchester City in 2012.

His career at the Etihad, on wages of £50,000 per week, never got going and reached a nadir when he was forced to train alone as his team-mates competed for points in matches.

Sinclair claims his best is yet to come following his arrival at Aston Villa from Manchester City

As the profile of his long-term partner Helen Flanagan rocketed through her appearance on ‘I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!’, Sinclair was left looking like a forgotten footballer.

A loan to West Bromwich Albion last season was undermined by a three-month hamstring injury and managerial upheaval, meaning he has not completed 90 minutes of a Premier League match since May 2012.

He sees this move to Villa Park — where he has a clause in his contract that allows him to pull out of a permanent £2.5m summer transfer if they are relegated this season — as key in kick-starting his career.

He said: ‘At City, I would be on my own with another coach and just going through drills. It has been very difficult. It has tested me mentally as a football player. Hopefully now there is light at the end of the tunnel and I can leave that behind me.

Sinclair had started to become overshadowed by his long-term partner Helen Flanagan

‘It defines you as a person how much you want to play football. That’s why I’m here now. I want to show everyone — and most of all I want to prove to myself — that it’s not just about the money. I want to be back out there.

‘What I’ve done on the pitch hasn’t left me. The only thing is form. Because I haven’t played for so long maybe it’s going to take me a few games.’

He smiles when it is suggested he might want to wrestle back the column inches from Flanagan, the former Coronation Street actress, but acknowledges his presence in the sports pages will provide a gauge of his success.

‘We have a baby on the way and she is not too fussed about being in the public eye at this moment in time. I want to be on back pages,’ he said.

‘She is due in June. That is another reason why I want to be settled and know where I am going. I have to focus and want to stay here at Villa.

‘People who don’t know me think, “Right, Scott Sinclair, he has a celebrity girlfriend, he has money and he doesn’t care about football”. I know that’s not true. I still have the love of the game and want to be out there and starting to prove myself.’
