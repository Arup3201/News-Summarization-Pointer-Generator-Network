Arsenal know they need to shore up their defence in order to keep high-flying Southampton at bay - and some of their players prepared for the task by shutting out the cold as they wrapped up warm in training with snoods on!

The Saints sit third in the Premier League table, three places and six points ahead of the Gunners ahead of their trip to the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night.

But Arsenal face some what of a selection crisis at left back - with both Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal facing a race against time to be fit for the game.

Gibbs is nursing a hip injury while Monreal has a knee problem.

However, Monreal looks most-likely to solve the full-back crisis as it is understood he took part in training on Tuesday morning. The Spaniard has been playing as a makeshift centre back in recent weeks, but Laurent Koscielny's return to fitness means he will revert back to battling it out with Gibbs for the left-back berth once both return to full fitness. 

Ahead of the match, in a bid to hold off the bitterly-cold temperatures at Arsenal's London Colney training ground, Lukas Podolski and Yaya Sanogo were among the players to sport snoods.

Olivier Giroud continued his return to full fitness by limbering up for some shooting practice and he could once again feature in a front-three trio with summer signings Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck against Southampton.

Tomas Rosicky, who has found his first-team opportunities limited so far this campaign, was also heavily involved in the training session on Tuesday.

But speaking about the left-back situation, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: 'I'm hoping that one of Kieran Gibbs or Nacho Monreal will be available but both are doubts.'

The Arsenal manager also admitted he tried out a front three of Giroud, Sanchez and Welbeck during the 1-0 victory over West Bromwich Albion at the weekend to see how it would fare as a strike force.

He continued: 'I wanted to see Giroud, Sanchez and Welbeck together (against West Brom). 

'And we are very united (at the club). Our job is to be competitive and to fight.'

Wenger also praised Wednesday's opponents, admitting that the Saints could gatecrash the top four this season after a wonderful start to the campaign under Dutch boss Ronald Koeman.

He added: 'Southampton are stable at the back and their new signings have integrated well.

'If Southampton can maintain their run, they can challenge (for Champions League places).

'It's a big game and an opportunity to show consistency in our results.' 

Damian Martinez is also likely to continue in goal for Wenger's men as both Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina are still not fit enough to return to the starting line up.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another severe doubt for the Gunners.
