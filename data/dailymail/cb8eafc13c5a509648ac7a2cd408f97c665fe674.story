Tim Sherwood has told his Aston Villa players to shake off the shackles and begin to throw punches in their fight against relegation.

The new Villa manager gave a bold first press conference and has vowed to get Christian Benteke back firing, underlining how important the Belgian striker will be in keeping the club up.

Sherwood is aiming for six wins from Villa's final 13 Premier League matches to ensure safety and also made a jovial reference to reaching the FA Cup final.

The 46-year-old visited the dressing room at half-time of the FA Cup win over Leicester City, and told the players to get the ball to Benteke more often.

Sherwood said: ‘I told them to play with less fear, I thought it was a bit tentative. Also to get Christian Benteke in the game a lot more. He was making good runs. We needed to look for him a bit earlier and to try and fill the box up more, give them something to think about.

'There is a little bit of apprehension about the place, obviously from losing football matches. We need to play with a little more freedom. Get the shackles off us. They are all good players, they need to play with more confidence and everything will be fine.

'I remember playing against Christian Benteke as a manager, what a handful he can be. We need to get back to that. He needs a goal for himself. That will breed confidence.

'He will be an important part because we know what he can be. All the best clubs in the world were after him. I’m sure we can tap into that confidence and get him back firing.

‘It's certainly not a one-man team, though. There are a lot of big players, no one wants to get relegated. It will hurt them to drop into the Championship. We can’t let that happen. They need to step to the front now, start performing.

'You will win games and lose games from now until the end of the season. But let’s have a go fighting. We need to start throwing a few punches ourselves.'

Asked if 13 games was enough to save Villa, with the club in the relegation zone on 22 points, Sherwood said: 'We need six wins, so it will be enough.’

Predecessor Paul Lambert had described the run-in as 13 Cup finals. ‘Paul’s right,’ said Sherwood, speaking at Villa Park. ‘But hopefully it will be 14 with the FA Cup.'

He added: 'We need to make this place a fortress, make it bouncing. We all believe we will stay in the division. We need everyone onside. Backroom staff, the players, and the fans are one million per cent important.’
