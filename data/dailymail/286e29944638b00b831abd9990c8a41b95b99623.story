The Labour party is preparing to pull the plug is looking to end its 90-year-old tie with the troubled Cooperative Bank.

Ed Miliband’s officials are looking to move the party’s current account and a £1.2million loan to the trade union-controlled Unity Trust Bank.

It would mark the end of a financial link dating back to the 1920s, but the Tories said the move would hand even greater power to the unions.

The Labour party is preparing to move its business away from the Co-Op bank after more than 90 years

More than 30 Labour MPs are sponsored by the Co-operative Party, but relations have been strained by the crisis engulfing the group.

The move by Labour to take its banking business elsewhere comes after a tumultuous period for the bank, which has seen big losses and the resignation of chairman Paul Flowers, who is now facing drug possession charges.

Last week the Co-op Group revealed catastrophic losses of £2.5billion for 2013, leading acting chief executive Richard Pennycook to warn: 'This is a wake-up call that the Co-op does not have a God-given right to exist.'

Euan Sutherland quit as chief executive of the vast group in March calling it a 'ungovernable'. 

Labour leader Ed Miliband is said to be considering putting the party's finances in the hands of the union-controlled Unity Trust Bank

The bulk of the losses relate to the Co-op's banking arm after a £1.5 billion hole was discovered in its finances.

It followed its ill-fated purchase of the Britannia building society and attempts to buy more than 600 Lloyds branches.

The Cooperative Movement and Labour joined as parties in the 1920s and the link-up with the banking arm is believed to have started then.

Labour stressed that the change of tack was for ‘commercial reasons’, but the controversy over the past year is thought to have strained relations.

The BBC reported that the bank - now 70 per cent-owned by American investors - was also keen to become ‘apolitical’.

A party spokesman said: ‘The Labour Party is constantly reviewing its financial arrangements. All decisions are taken for commercial reasons.’

However the mooted switch to the Unity Trust Bank, which is 75 per cent owned by trade unions, was criticised by the Tories.

Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘These proposals would hand the trade unions even more control over Ed Miliband and the Labour Party.

‘The unions already pick the candidates, buy the policies and choose the leader. Now Ed Miliband wants them to hold the purse strings as well.

‘If Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to the trade union barons then he is too weak to stand up for hardworking people. This would put Britain’s economic security at risk.’
