We're all either guilty of it or have a friend who does it: oversharing on social networking sites. And it could be ruining your relationships offline.

But while oversharing comes in many guises (the loved-up status updates, the endless baby/cat/food photos, the relentless check-ins), there's one method of keeping ePals abreast of your life that is driving us to all tears quicker than any other: the selfie.

It's a method of communication on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter beloved of celebrities including Rihanna, Harry Styles, Cara Delevingne and Peaches Geldof.

But sharing too many photographs of your own face or body on Mark Zuckerberg's media channel could be detrimental to your relationships with friends, colleagues and even your family, according to a British study.

Bajan singer Rihanna can't get enough of the selfie, but has found herself in hot water after posting self-portraits in risque situations, such as half-naked in bed with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, or smoking suspicious-looking cigarettes

Young English model Cara Delevingne is famous for her selfies, most of which involve her dressing up in wacky fancy dress outfits, pulling silly faces and raising one of her legendarily bushy eyebrows

How the quantity and subject matter of the pictures you upload onto Facebook impacts upon your real-world relationships was researched at the University of Birmingham, the University of the West of England, the University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University, in a project appropriately titled Tagger's Delight.

The researchers found that an increased level of sharing photos of the self prompted a decreased level of support - in terms of 'likes' garnered - from friends and colleagues.

Peaches Geldof uses Instagram mainly to post photographs of her two babies, Astala and Phaedra, but occasionally she steps in for a slice of the action

One Direction star Harry Styles is always updating his Instagram feed with snaps of himself with bandmates, famous friends and adoring fans

Commenting on the findings that 
excessive selfie-sharing may damage relationships, lead author of the 
report Dr David Houghton, a lecturer in marketing at Birmingham Business
 School, said: 'Our research found that those who frequently post 
photographs on Facebook risk damaging real-life relationships.

'This is because people, other than 
very close friends and relatives, don't seem to relate well to those who
 constantly share photos of themselves.

'It's
 worth remembering that the information we post to our 'friends' on 
Facebook, actually gets viewed by lots of different categories of 
people: partners; friends; family; colleagues and acquaintances; and 
each group seems to take a different view of the information shared.'

The study, fully entitled Tagger's 
Delight? Disclosure And Liking In Facebook, also found that young women 
were the most likely to find support in the form of 'likes' on Facebook.
 Older users and men received less support when they shared online.

Young American singer Justin Bieber is the ultimate selfie-taker, and rarely a minute goes by in which we aren't informed what this chap is wearing, eating or doing

Mrs Orlando Bloom, model Miranda Kerr, has the sort of face most of us would probably be selfie-ing all the live-long day, were it ours instead...

Supermodel Heidi Klum, pictured right with comedian Amy Poehler, is an ardent selfie-poster, probably because she enjoys having control over the camera and the editing room for a change

We've seen enough celebrity selfies on Instagram to last us well into the next millennium.... and it seems even they are tiring of their grinning mugs.

So famous fans of the self-portrait snap have swapped faces for posteriors, and are currently enjoying a bit of a renaissance... in the form of the bottom-selfie. The belfie.

Heidi Klum got the #belfie movement kick-started with this cheeky (sorry) picture of her beach bum

Well, if you had Rihanna's bottom wouldn't you do a #belfie?

Heidi Klum and Rihanna have spearheaded the movement for posting photographs of sandy, bikini-clad bottoms on social networking sites, as Anna Hart of My Daily reported.

Other illustrious fans of the rear-view shot include Kylie Minogue and Made In Chelsea's Lucy Watson.

So... would you?

Best pals Rihanna, left, and Cara Delevingne can't resist pinching each other's bottoms and then telling everyone about it on Instagram
