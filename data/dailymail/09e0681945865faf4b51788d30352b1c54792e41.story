George Zimmerman says he is suffering from post-traumatic stress and is homeless after his trial for the shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.

He made the claims to journalist Ilia Calderón, who interviewed him for the Spanish language current affairs show Aqui y Ahora which will air on Univision on Sunday at 7pm.

During the interview, Zimmerman also claimed that Martin threatened to kill him before he shot and killed the unarmed 17-year-old.

'Sad. Very sad': How George Zimmerman described himself in the recent interview with Ilia Calderón

'When he saw my handgun and looked at it and told me that he was going to kill me that night, uh, that was enough of a threat after the way he had attacked me. So, I felt his hand going for my weapon,' Zimmerman said, reports the Orlando Sentinal.

When asked how he feels now, Zimmerman responded 'Sad. Very sad.'

Zimmerman was found not guilty of murder in the controversial case in 2013.

Insight: Zimmerman told Calderón that he receives death threats due to bad media coverage, not the fact that he shot Trayvon Martin

He told Calderón that after shooting Martin, his main concern was that he had missed his target.

'I was afraid it had gone through his clothes and that it was going to go... get lost, and, um, you know, go into a house and - because the young man was still talking to me, as I have said. So I thought that it hadn't... affected him, and I got worried, and I said, "I hope that it hasn't - that the bullet hasn't hit a neighbor,"' Zimmerman said.

The much-maligned former insurance salesman who has recently taken to selling his unique art on eBay said he was '100 per cent' sure of his actions that night, and that had he not shot Martin, the teen would have killed him.

International notoriety: Zimmerman's case became known around the world

Zimmerman said that he has had death threats since the trial, which he put down to his portrayal in the media and not his shooting of a teenaged boy.

Zimmerman told Calderón that he can no longer lead a normal life and must wear a bullet-proof vest when he is out in public.

Describing himself as 'totally homeless,' Zimmerman said his family helps him 'a lot.'
