She is the showgirl credited for putting the smile back on Silvio Berlusconi's face, accused of dressing as a nun then stripping down to her underwear at one of his infamous bunga bunga parties earlier this yea.

And it seems there is no stopping showgirl-turned-councillor Nicole Minetti, who couldn't help but strip off once more - but this time on the catwalk at Milan Fashion Week.

The 26-year-old councillor for Lombardy strutted and posed in a tiny purple and white bikini by Para New Generation on the catwalk.

Although she is under pressure to hand 
in her resignation as Berlusconi hopes to become prime minister for the 
fourth time at elections expected in the Spring, the political beauty told Sky News she has no plans to resign from the PdL party.

'I haven't had any second thoughts, I won't resign,' she told Sky.

When discussing upcoming elections, she admitted that she would vote for PD candidate Matteo Renzi if anyone because he is 'young'.

She added: 'Fashion and politics can easily go hand in hand. Actually, I think politics serve fashion.'

The former TV showgirl has been involved with a number of scandals since joining Berlusconi's team

Nicole Minetti, whose mother is a British dance instructor in Rimini, on the Adriatic coast, once appeared as a dancer on a TV show on one of the billionaire politician's channels called Colorado Cafe and on another programme called Scorie which is an Italian version of Candid Camera.

Bilingual Miss Minetti, whose mother Georgina Reed is from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, treated Berlusconi's broken teeth after he was hit in the face with a statue at a rally in December 2009.

The former showgirl had only just qualified as a dental hygienist but within a month she was repairing Mr Berlusconi's face after the attack in Milan and he soon took a liking to her and recruited her to his team.

No stranger to headlines, in 2011 prosecutors asked for her to be charged with recruiting prostitutes for Berlusconi - a probe involving a teenage 
prostitute allegedly paid for sex by the controversial politician.

Miss
Minetti was said to have procured dozens of 
attractive young women for Berlusconi's infamous 'bunga bunga' parties.

The
phrase - which is one of the most widely searched on the internet - is 
thought to refer to a crude after-dinner sex game played at the parties 
which were held in Berlusconi's villa near Milan.

Nicole Minetti was born in 1986 in Rimini to an English dance instructor mother and Italian business father.

Nicole Minetti trained as a dental nurse and was shot to political stardom after treating Berlusconi

She began work as a dancer on comedy-variety TV show Colorado Cafe

She then went on to train as a dental hygienist and treated prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at San Raffaele Hospital after he was attacked in Milan with a statue and needed urgent dental surgery.

Taking a liking to her, Berlusconi invited her to become a politician and she was shortlisted for the upcoming elections which made her the victim of much criticism

Berlusconi subsequently appointed her a regional councillor in Lombardy

She was also involved in the so-called Caso Ruby scandal and it was discovered that she owned four apartments which were occupied by showgirls

In 2011, prosecutors asked for her to be charged with recruiting prostitutes for Berlesconi for one of his infamous 'bunga bunga' parties
