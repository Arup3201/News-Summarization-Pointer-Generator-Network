A man on a flight from Singapore to Brisbane was restrained after exploding 'in a rage', damaging a seat and biting the arm of a fellow passenger.

Passengers aboard Etihad Airways  470 held the man down, while the flight was forced to return to Singapore so the man could be escorted from the plane. 

Following the incident, the flight has since arrived safely in Brisbane.

According to Tracey Mewis, a passenger who was aboard the Etihad flight, the man's behaviour before taking off from Singapore was noticeably odd, the ABC reports. 

'We thought he was just off his face - he hassled two lots of couples', Ms Mewis said. 

She said airport workers pulled the man aside and spoke to him before boarding. Ms Mewis said for the first 40 minutes on the flight he was fine.

Ms Mewis describes him ripping out the TV screen from the seat in front before assaulting people on board. 

'He assaulted one of the male flight attendants and then guys on the plane just pinned him down and held him down and restrained him,' she said.

 Another passenger, Rob, was one of the men to restrain the man 'in a rage'. 

'I had to apprehend him and in doing so just got a bit of a bite on the arm,' he said.

Rob arrived in Brisbane airport on his birthday with a bandaged arm. He believes the man was drunk and may have abused substances.

David Bradbury, who was on board and helped hold down the man, said while in a rage he was 'quoting religious quotes'.

Mr Bradbury feared the plane was being hijacked before realising what was actually happening. 

An Etihad Airways spokesman confirmed that the incident  occurred and apologised for the inconvenience.

The spokesman said when the plane arrived back in Singapore authorities detained the passenger, who is believed to be in his early 30s.

Etihad Airways insisted they have a zero tolerance policy towards such incidents.
