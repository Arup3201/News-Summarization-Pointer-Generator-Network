Death Row: Kelly Gissendaner (pictured) is set to die by lethal injection in Georgia at 7pm tonight

The only woman in Georgia on death row is due to be executed tonight at 7pm - after an astonishing last meal of cheeseburgers, fries, ice cream and a fatty salad - unless lawyers can convince officials to spare her life.

Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 46, is due to be given a lethal injection at a state prison in Jackson in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997.

She was sentenced to die after her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death at her urging.

Gissendaner, who will be the first female executed in Georgia in 70 years, has also made headlines with her request from prison authorities for a no-holds-barred last meal.

The feast includes two Burger King Whoppers, two large orders of fries, cornbread, a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing, popcorn and cherry-vanilla ice cream.

However, there is a chance she receive a last-minute stay of execution - if her lawyers convince Georgia's justice system to cancel the killing.

Attorneys are mounting a last-ditch attempt to persuade the State Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute her sentence to life without parole.

She was denied clemency at a hearing last week, but lawyers argue that extra witnesses from within the prison system could help persuade them. Previous attempts have rested on her remorse and new-found faith.

In a statement ten years ago, Gissendaner herself said: 'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die'.

Murder: Gissendaner, shown left in her arrest mugshot from 1997, is facing death for plotting the murder of her husband. However, her boyfriend Gregory Owen, right, who actually did the deed, is not on death row and could be paroled within a decade

She has also drawn attention to the fact that, while she did not kill her husband, the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing death - and will be eligible for parole in 2023.

If the bid fails, her lawyers are expected to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. It has already denied one appeal.

Her execution had been due to take place last week, but was canceled after a winter storm caused disruption in the area.  

Gissendaner would be the first woman executed in Georgia since 1945 and only the 16th woman put to death nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976. 

Gissendaner's lawyers note that the parole board already heard from many people testifying about her faith and remorse at a hearing last week before denying her clemency.

But, her lawyers argue, the board did not hear from many Department of Corrections employees whose perspective 'would have left no doubt that a grant of clemency is supported in this case.'

The most important witness the board did not hear from is Kathy Seabolt, who served as her warden for six years, first at Metro State Prison and then at Lee Arrendale State Prison.

Seabolt could testify that former parole board chair James Donald promised Gissendaner would receive clemency, her lawyers wrote.

Each time the topic came up in conversations between Donald and Seabolt, 'Donald reiterated his statement that Ms. Gissendaner did not need to worry about clemency as it was a foregone conclusion,' they wrote.

Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the parole board to subpoena some other corrections employees so they can testify without fear of retaliation.

Although department rules allow employees to speak to lawyers for capital clemency proceedings, the reality is less clear, Gissendaner's lawyers wrote. Some employees had said they would testify and provide written statements on Gissendaner's behalf, but changed their minds after getting a memo from the new warden, who succeeded Seabolt last year.

'Under no circumstances are you to discuss this with people outside the institution. Staff should also be careful what is said to other inmates and personal feelings are to be suppressed,' Kathleen Kennedy wrote on Jan. 29 as she notified staff of the likelihood of the upcoming execution.

Gissendaner's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial, she had been offered the same plea deal as Owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years.

'At one time, therefore, all the parties involved in the case thought a sentence less than death was appropriate for Ms. Gissendaner,' her lawyers wrote.

Owen, who is the one who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death, took the deal and testified for the prosecution. Gissendaner balked at the parole agreement and took her lawyer's advice to go to trial.

The parole board has granted clemency before in cases involving disproportionate sentences for co-defendants, her lawyers wrote.

'In fact, this Board has on at least four occasions in the past commuted a death sentence of a co-defendant who was not the actual killer of the victim,' the lawyers wrote.

Douglas Gissendaner's parents and sisters want her to be executed, but two of Kelly and Douglas' three children have asked the parole board to spare her life, the lawyers wrote.

In statements submitted with her clemency application, Kayla and Dakota Gissendaner describe a journey from bitterness and anger to forgiveness; finally they have a meaningful relationship with their mother.

'We also believe that Kelly's death will not restore them or make them whole,' Gissendaner's lawyers wrote of the entire Gissendaner family.
