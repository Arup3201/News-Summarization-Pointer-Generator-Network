West Ham are in talks over a £250,000 loan deal for AC Milan forward M’Baye Niang.

The 19-year-old was chased by Everton, Tottenham and Arsenal 18 months ago while at Caen.

The France Under 21 international became the San Siro club’s second youngest scorer in history, but a dip in form and Milan’s disastrous season saw him shipped off to Montpellier on loan in January.

He returned at the end of this season having been in trouble and handed a suspended jail term for his involvement in a hit-and-run accident earlier in the year.

Niang can make the deal permanent for a fee of around £4million should he impress.
