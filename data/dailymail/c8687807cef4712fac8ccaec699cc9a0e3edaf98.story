Court: Gordon Fraser is alleged to have been driving a car when it was registered as going over the speed
limit

A police chief and his wife were today charged with perverting the course of justice after she allegedly accepted speeding penalty points on his behalf.

Acting Deputy Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police, Gordon Fraser, 48, was alleged to have been behind the wheel of a car when it was registered as going over the speed limit in Scotland.

His wife Teresa, 42, is accused of accepting the penalty points on his behalf and claiming she was behind the wheel.

Today, the Thames and Chiltern Crown 
Prosecution Service said the couple would appear before St Albans 
Magistrates’ Court on Friday to formally face the single charge of 
perverting the course of justice.

Baljit
Ubhey OBE, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown 
Prosecution Service said today the incident was investigated by 
Hertfordshire Constabulary due to Fraser’s links to the Leicestershire 
force.

'A criminal 
complaint was made alleging that Mrs Fraser had accepted responsibility 
for a speeding offence allegedly committed by Mr Fraser on 29 September 
2011 in Strathclyde,' she said.

'Having carefully considered all of the 
available evidence, we concluded that there is sufficient evidence to 
bring criminal charges against Mr and Mrs Fraser and therefore, 
authorised Hertfordshire Constabulary to charge them with doing acts 
tending to pervert the course of justice.

'The essence of the charge is that Mr Fraser, having allegedly committed a speeding offence, falsely informed the investigating authorities that Mrs Fraser had been the driver of the vehicle in question, and she falsely accepted responsibility for the speeding offence.

'The decision to charge was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.'

Fraser joined the Leicestershire force in June 2009, and was made temporary deputy chief constable six months later.

During his time at West Midlands police, Fraser worked in various roles including Head of Intelligence, Head of Crime and Head of Business and Service Improvement.

He received a national award for the dismantling of serious and organised crime networks and has experience of managing covert operations.
