She is the perennially cool actress whose off-duty attire is just as covetable as her always edgy red carpet choices.

Yet despite her style icon status and access to the most lust-worthy designer labels, U.S. star Kate Bosworth has always been a firm fan of the great British high street.

Her recent video collaboration with our favourite high street store Topshop ticked all the trend boxes and now the cool blonde has shared her favourite buys from the fashion-forward brand, as well as some musings on British style and London life.

The actress, who spent two weeks in 
London filming a mini-movie for Topshop's Christmas campaign, took the 
time to share her style secrets, her favourite corners of the capital - 
and the pieces she was planning to stuff into her suitcase before flying
back home to the States.

'I
think every girl has the same feeling - I have to go to Topshop, I have
to have these,' said Kate, who demonstrates her vocal talents in the 
film - directed by her fiance Michael Polish - with a haunting rendition
of the song Winter Wonderland.

The starlet, who has also been spotted out and about in H&M and ASOS designs, listed the recent collection from up and coming Scottish designer J.W. Anderson among her favourite Topshop buys.

'I just love the J.W Anderson collection - especially the graphic print tees,' she said.

Away from the spotlight, Kate is regularly photographed in the kind of shorts, floaty dresses and Isabel Marant-style boots that typify the off-duty wardrobes of many of LA's hip young starlets.

'I keep going on back to the cowboy boot - there's something quite folk about them that I love,' she admits.

But she wouldn't thank you for trying to pigeon hole her style as 'boho'.

'I think it's difficult when you get asked about your style,' she said.

'It's a hard thing because it constantly changes.'

Indeed, the actress is never predictable on the red carpet, switching from super sexy to high fashion to demure with effortless ease.

Kate, who is based in LA but was 
raised on the east coast of America, revelled in her chance to explore London, where she said the frosty winter 
temperatures made her feel right at home.

'We don't really get seasons in LA so
it's nice to bundle up and explore London. I was raised on the east 
coast of America so it felt a little like being at home on the 
holidays,' she said.

The 29-year-old said she was a fan of Soho's vintage shops and quirky bars and restaurants, as well as soaking up iconic London sights like Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament from the vantage point of the Southbank.

The glitzy gold Topshop Unique dress that caught Kate's eye is perfect for the Christmas season, while the MOTO denim pinafore dress is ideal layered over a shirt or striped tee for less formal festive occasions.

These heavy buckled boots will toughen up the girliest of dresses, but Kate keeps her make-up choices feminine and natural with this velvet lipstick in Rumour Has It, a flattering dusty rose shade.
