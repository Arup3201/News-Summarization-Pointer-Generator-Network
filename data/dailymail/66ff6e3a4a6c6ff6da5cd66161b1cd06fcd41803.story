U.S. special operations forces attempted to rescue an American and Briton held hostage by al-Qaeda during an early morning raid on a cave in Yemen, but the two Westerners had already been moved by the time commandos arrived.

News of the pre-dawn Tuesday raid was first reported by the New York Times on Wednesday, which detailed how Americans, including members of the Navy’s SEAL Team Six, worked with Yemeni counterterrorism forces to stage the attack on an al-Qaeda hideout in the Yemeni province of Hadhramaut, near the border with Saudi Arabia.

SEAL Team Six is the elite team which participated in the 2012 raid in which former al-Qaeda leader and 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was assassinated.

Eight hostages - including six Yemenis, a Saudi Arabian and an Ethiopian - were rescued in this week's raid. A member of the Yemen special forces confirmed that an unnamed American and Briton were expected to be among the hostages in the remote cave.

U.S. officials confirmed that the raid took place, but referred all questions about the operation to the Yemeni government.

‘I would just tell you we continue to support Yemeni counterterrorism efforts and would refer you to them to talk to any operations,’ Rear Admiral John F Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters on Tuesday.

According to the Times, the raid happened in the early hours of Tuesday morning, when about two dozen U.S. special forces and Yemeni soldiers were flown to a dune-filled area called Hagr al-Saiaar.  

The team then made their way on foot to a cave where the hostages were being held, and engaged in a firefight with members of the group al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Seven AQAP fighters were killed in the battle, officials said.

The soldiers and freed hostages then hiked back to waiting helicopters, and flew out of the rural region overrun by al-Qaeda groups who are protected by the local tribes.

The Tuesday operation was the first reported incident where American forces have operated on the ground in Yemen. However, the U.S. military has a strong presence in the country, which has authorized the Pentagon to carry out drone strikes on terrorist groups.

So far, the Yemeni government has only confirmed the identity of one of the hostages freed in the raid: Khalil al-Mekhlafi.

Al-Meklafi, a lecturer at Yemen’s Al Bayda University who holds a doctorate in computer science, and two of his colleagues were abducted last year after finishing classes at the school.

Professor Sailan Al Arami, president of the Al Bayda, said al-Meklafi was hired by the university last year after serving for months at a police academy.

A local journalist told the Times that al-Meklafi was likely abducted by al-Qaeda militants, who thought his time as a police officer made him knowledgeable in how to make explosives.

‘They think that he would help them making bombs,’ the journalist, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Times.

The Saudi Arabian hostage has also not been identified yet, but it is alleged that it could be diplomat Abdullah al-Khalidi.

Al-Khalidi was kidnapped in Aden, Yemen in 2012, and has appeared in al-Qaeda videos pleading for his release (a grab of one of the videos on the right) 

Al-Khalidi was kidnapped from the Yemeni city of Aden in 2012, and has pleaded for his release in videos released by al-Qaeda to the Saudi Arabian government. A spokesman at the Saudi Embassy in Washington told the Times that they had no information about the citizen who was released.

This past summer, U.S. special ops participated in a similar raid in Syria, where they failed to rescue American hostages held by the Islamic State, after the extremist group started beheading American journalists and aid workers in videotaped recordings. 

The identity of the American targeted in the Tuesday raid remains a mystery, since there hasn’t been a report of an American held hostage by AQAP in Yemen.
