Horse-drawn carriage drivers are preparing for a fight after New York's mayor-elect Bill de Blasio said he wanted to outlaw the iconic rides when he takes office tomorrow.

Mr de Blasio used his mayoral campaign to protest against the rides, saying it was not humane to have horses vying for space with traffic on the city's congested roads.

But those who make a living out of ferrying visitors around the park say banning the carriages will damage tourism in the city.

At a press conference on Monday Mr de Blasio said ending the practice of horse-drawn rides, a $15 million a year industry in New York, was a priority.

'We are going to quickly and aggressively move to make horse carriages no longer a part of the landscape,' he said.

'They are not humane, they are not appropriate for the year 2014. It's over.'

Many of the 200 or so people who make a living out of the carriage-ride industry have threatened to take legal action against Mr de Blasio and the city.

'You cannot just get rid of a business, a perfectly legal well-regulated … just because a few people don't like it,' Christina Hansen, a driver and spokeswomen for the industry, told the Daily News.

'If he wants to ban them because they're dangerous and inhumane, he needs to prove that.'

Sid Kolo, of New York Central Park Tours, said the rides were part of New York history and had been going since the park opened more than 100 years ago.

'People expect us to be here. It’s like taking away the Empire State Building. It’s the same as taking the [Christmas] tree from Rock Center,' he told NBC News.

Animal activists however pointed out that everyone in the city traveled by horse-drawn carriage when Central Park was first opened.

It wasn't until the 1940s that a New York mayor first issued permits for carriage rides as part of the tourist industry, according to the blog Carriage Horses NYC.

Rights groups have also argued that the horses lead a dangerous life, vying for space on the city's congested roads with traffic, and being confined to small stalls at night.

At least three horses have died in road accidents in the past seven years.

Although the owners are required to give the horses five-week vacations out to pasture, many argue that isn't enough to protect their health.

Tourists appeared divided by the 
prospect of a ban. Some, such as Kathy and Keith Walker  said they had 
booked their ride before leaving Washington on vacation.

But others on sites such as TripAdvisor welcomed the ban and expressed concern for the future of the horses and their drivers.

Mr de Blasio, who has hired a legal team to work on the ban, wants to replace the horses with antique-looking electric cars.

He said he would work with the carriage owners to make sure tourists still have a way to enjoy a ride around the park.

The city council will have to approve any ban before it can take affect.
