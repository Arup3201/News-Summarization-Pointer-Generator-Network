In the exceptionally difficult and frustrating circumstances, England’s coaches have put together a side that, in most areas, has enough quality to challenge the All Blacks.

Stuart Lancaster and his assistants have had to choose from a significantly diluted pool of available players, given the enforced absence of more than a dozen leading men, including five Lions. Yet, the line-up they have selected to play at Eden Park reflects the enhanced depth at their disposal in the majority of positions.

There’s no Alex Corbisiero at loosehead prop, but Joe Marler is a powerful deputy who has had a fine season. Dan Cole is not on tour, but David Wilson filled in at tighthead with distinction during the Six Nations. In the second row, Courtney Lawes will be hugely missed but Geoff Parling – who started in Sydney when the Lions won their series against Australia last summer – is a reliable figure to fill the void and run the lineout with supreme expertise.

Big test: Freddie Burns was an outside candidate but injuries have helped the fly half back into the team

In the back row, England are without Tom Wood and Billy Vunipola, but Ben Morgan is a recent starter at No 8 and a potent ball-carrier, while James Haskell deserves his opportunity at blindside on the strength of Test-class form in the latter part of the club season. The flanker has been the man for a crisis before – producing a stunning defensive performance when the shattered and depleted national team held firm to draw with the Springboks in Port Elizabeth two years ago.

The management will desperately hope that Danny Care overcomes his shoulder problem to start this series opener, as he was the high-octane catalyst for so much of their best attacking work during the Six Nations. Ben Youngs is an experienced replacement if necessary, but he does not have the momentum of prime form from the domestic campaign to take into the match.

Manu Tuilagi will provide a marauding threat to the All Blacks from outside centre – as he has done in the past – while Mike Brown is capable of carving up the home defence in keeping with recent heroics. Lancaster will also be happy enough with his wing combination of Marland Yarde and Jonny May.

The primary problems lie at hooker and in the 10-12 area. Rob Webber will be expected to hit the ground running in the No 2 shirt, despite not playing for a month due to a knee injury. Dylan Hartley is poised to return in Dunedin next week, so Webber must somehow deliver similar physicality, nous and lineout-throwing precision before making way for the first-choice man in that position.

Plunged into action: Ben Youngs could play at scrum half if Care fails to make the cut

Brown, Yarde, Tuilagi, Eastmond, May, Burns, Care, Marler, Webber, Wilson, Launchbury, Parling, Haskell, Morgan, Robshaw 

England are pitching Freddie Burns in at fly half in a selection based on reputation rather than form. His game collapsed during the season amid rumours about his move to Leicester from Gloucester and there is precious little evidence yet that he has regained sufficient conviction to run the show with authority. But, with Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler not able to play due to jet-lag protocols and George Ford recovering at home after shoulder surgery, Lancaster and Co have erred on the side of familiarity by preferring Burns to Danny Cipriani. Now they must hold their breath and hope.

It is a similar scenario at inside centre, where England are temporarily without Billy Twelvetrees, Brad Barritt and Luther Burrell – who plays at No 12 for Northampton – so Kyle Eastmond is the last man standing. He was superb in Argentina last summer but sending him out to face the world champions in a stadium where they haven’t lost for 20 years is a high-stakes way of assessing whether he has the big-game attributes to cut it at Test level.

So much will depend on how Burns and Eastmond acquit themselves in defence. The doomsday scenario involves Ma’a Nonu repeatedly hurtling through flimsy tackles in that area and igniting All Black attacks in open space. The optimistic outlook is that a strong England pack dominate possession and Burns gives the tourists territorial advantage. Yet, even if that vision is achieved, New Zealand have more potency to summon from the bench, so if they haven’t taken control by the hour mark, they surely will in the final quarter.
