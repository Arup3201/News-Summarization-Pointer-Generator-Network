Roma have made a fresh approach to Petr Cech's advisers about a deal for the Chelsea goalkeeper.

Jose Mourinho said the 32-year-old would not be leaving Stamford Bridge following Mark Schwarzer's departure to Leicester City but Roma want to see whether a deal can be agreed now. 

Cech has been at the west London outfit since 2004 - winning the Barclays Premier league, FA Cup, League Cup, Europa League and Champions League during his time there - but has found himself on the substitutes' bench this season.

Arsenal have also shown an interest but Chelsea would be unwilling to sell Cech to another English team

And with young Belgian keeper Thibaut Courtois in excellent form it seems unlikely the former Sparta Prague man will be returning to the first team for more than the odd game any time soon.

Premier League rivals Arsenal have also shown an interest but Chelsea would be unwilling to sell Cech to another English team.

Roma signed Ashley Cole on a free transfer from Chelsea in the summer and are now looking to benefit from another of Mourinho's cast-offs.
