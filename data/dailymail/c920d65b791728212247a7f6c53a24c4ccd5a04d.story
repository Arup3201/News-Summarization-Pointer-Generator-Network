The man who sparked a hijacking scare on a flight to Bali has appeared at Brisbane Magistrates Court.

Matt Christopher Lockley was clean shaven, had his hair slicked back and wore a grey suit, to face a charge of interfering with a crew member stemming from the April 25 incident.

Police allege the Australian plumber, 27, had to be restrained by a Virgin Australia crew member during a flight from Brisbane to Denpasar, Indonesia.

The 27-year-old faced court after sparking a hijacking scare on a Virgin Australia flight from Brisbane to Denpasar, Indonesia

It's alleged he banged on the cockpit door, causing pilots to trigger an 'unlawful interference' alert that put the Indonesian air force and police on notice for a hijacker on arrival.

Lockley cut a different figure on Friday to the man arrested by Indonesian authorities when he got off the plane in Bali on Anzac Day.

His lawyer Mark Williams asked for the case to be adjourned for three weeks.

Mr Williams said he'd only received the brief of evidence from prosecutors late on Thursday.

Commonwealth prosecutor Anita Sharma didn't oppose bail and the case was adjourned until June 27.

After his arrest in Indonesia Lockley was released without charge and sent back to Australia.

Australian Federal Police issued Lockley with a notice to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on June 6.
