Tougher rules: David Cameron, speaking at the headquarters of B&Q in Eastleigh, Hampshire, said he wanted tougher rules to ensure visitors to the UK do not 'take advantage' of public services

David Cameron signalled a crackdown on foreigners using public services yesterday, saying Britain should not be a ‘soft touch’ for welfare tourists.

The Prime Minister, who wants tougher rules to ensure visitors do not ‘take advantage’ of British generosity, said those from outside the EU should pay when they use our hospitals.

Officials should also do more to reclaim the costs of NHS treatment from EU countries whose nationals take ill here.

Mr Cameron confirmed he has asked officials to draw up plans to withhold welfare payments, housing benefit and legal aid from Romanians and Bulgarians expected to flock to the UK in January when restrictions on their travel here are lifted.

He spoke out during his first campaign visit to Eastleigh, where the Tories are locked in a by-election battle with their Liberal Democrat Coalition partners after the resignation of disgraced MP Chris Huhne.

Speaking at the headquarters of the DIY retailer B&Q, Mr Cameron told voters: ‘There’s a lot more to do to make sure we are not a soft touch and while we are a welcoming, open country, we don’t allow people to come here to take advantage of us, which happens too often today.

‘We are not tough enough about people coming from the other side of the world who decide to use our health service. They have not contributed through their taxes... When people come from outside the EU, they should pay for the NHS.

‘Within the EU, there are forms you have to fill in to make sure you get access to healthcare, but we haven’t been very good at charging back and getting the money for the work we carry out, so we need to do that better.

Recoup the costs: Mr Cameron told the audience that officials should do more to reclaim the costs of NHS treatment from EU countries whose nationals take ill here

Immigration minister Mark Harper revealed last night that to prevent welfare tourism, the Government is considering forcing Romanians, Bulgarians and other EU nationals to register for residency permits if they intend to stay in the UK longer than three months.

He told ITV News: ‘One of the things we’re looking at – other European countries do it – is insist that people register.

Tightening the belt: The Prime Minister said he has asked officials to draw up plans to withhold benefits from Romanians and Bulgarians expected to flock to the UK next year when travel restrictions are lifted

‘If you look at other countries, they have a mandatory registration for all citizens from all other EU countries.

'Before they can access services, they insist on them registering. We’re looking to see what the costs will be, what the benefits will be.’

In a clear admission the Government has no idea how many Romanians and Bulgarians will come to the UK next year, Mr Harper confirmed ministers have not sought to publish an estimate because the range of possibilities is too wide.

On Tuesday Mr Cameron chaired a cabinet sub-committee of ministers who have been asked to find ways of reducing the UK’s ‘pull factors’ for immigrants.

Yesterday he said he had set up a unit to look at ‘all benefits people can get from coming here and asking whether it’s fair’.

The group is examining whether the UK can restrict benefits for migrants from Romania and Bulgaria when travel restrictions are lifted in January.

But last night EU Commissioner Viviane Reding said they must be treated the same way as citizens of other member states who have the right to work and settle in the UK.

During his visit to Eastleigh, Mr Cameron took a pot shot at the Lib Dems, reminding voters the by-election was called because Huhne has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.
