A woman, who was involved in a horrific road accident, woke from a coma to discover that she was 12 weeks pregnant.

Last year, Gemma Holmes was riding a moped when she was flung across a busy road into a lamp post.

She suffered extensive injuries, including a broken back, and doctors didn't expect her to survive.

But she defied the odds and is now on the road to recovery - with her now 12-week-old son Ruben.

Gemma Holmes was involved in a road accident that broke her back and put her in a coma. When she woke up she was told she was 12 weeks pregnant but had not memory of who the father was

While in hospital, tests revealed that Gemma was in fact 12 weeks pregnant.

Ms Holmes was in a coma and unable to be told the news, so doctors turned to her mother, Julie, to make the decision about whether the baby should be kept or terminated.

'Doctors suggested a termination because Gemma would not be able to undergo surgery to fix her back until she gave birth.

'So many things went through my head but I wanted to wait until Gemma was awake to make the decision,' Julie, who has taken on the role of Gemma's full time carer while she is confined to a wheelchair, told ITV's This Morning.

When Gemma eventually awoke she was given the news, but she had no recollection having been in a relationship because she had developed severe memory loss.

The previous three years were entirely blank.

Ruben (pictured) was delivered by caesarian section 12 weeks ago. His mother, Gemma, gave him the middle name Miracle because he survived such an ordeal

Gemma suffered horrific injuries after the crash on her moped. She was hurled across a street and into a lamp post and was left with a broken back and in a coma for six weeks

Despite her grave health problems, she made the decision to keep the baby.

'I just thought that if this little baby inside me had managed to survive the awful crash then he was meant to be,' said Gemma.

Gemma endured considerable pain during the pregnancy as she was unable to take high doses of painkillers, which can harm an unborn baby, while she recovered.

In May this year she gave birth to Ruben Miracle Holmes by caesarian section.

Despite his traumatic beginnings, baby Ruben Miracle was delivered with no complications by caesarian section

Gemma (pictured with son Ruben) couldn't have a natural birth because of the brain injury she suffered from the crash. Giving birth puts pressure on the brain which could have worsened any existing problems

'I couldn't have a natural birth because the brain injury I suffered from the crash put me at risk of further damage - giving birth puts pressure on the brain,' she said.

'I was also told my body would not be able to cope with the contractions after breaking my back.'

The mother and son are now doing well and Gemma is to undergo an MRI scan soon to discover whether an operation will enable her to one day walk again.

'Ruben's my little miracle and I really hope I will one day be able to run around with him,' she said.
