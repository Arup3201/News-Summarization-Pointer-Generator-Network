The Queen is known to be inseparable from her beloved Corgis.

Now poignant pictures have emerged of the graves of royal pets from throughout the generations.

The little-known plot is hidden away in a quiet corner of the 20,000-acre Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

It was created by Queen Victoria after the death of her Collie, Noble, in 1887, and revived in 1959 when Elizabeth II wanted somewhere to bury her first Corgi, Susan.

Dear friends: The Queen began using the graveyard after the death of her first Corgi, Susan (left), and has buried all her descendants there, including Sugar (right)

Famous family: Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Princess Anne, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and a pet Corgi in 1985

The puppy was given to the Queen on her 18th birthday by King George VI, and her gravestone calls her 'the faithful companion of the Queen', an epitaph which is also used on the headstones of two of her descendants, Sugar and Heather.

A stone boundary wall inset with plaques separates the pet cemetery from the rest of the estate.

One commemorates the life of Candy, a yellow Labrador who died in 1958 after having belonged to Prince Philip for six years.

Another is engraved with the name Sandringham Slipper - a black Labrador who died in 1980 after eight years as part of the royal family.

Sandringham Brae, another black Lab, is described as 'a gentleman amongst dogs' on his grave, while roan Cocker Spaniel Sandringham Fern is remembered for being a 'tireless worker and mischievous character'.

The most recent death in the Queen's menagerie is that of 
13-year-old Monty, who starred with Her Majesty in the James Bond sketch
 for the Olympics opening ceremony.

However, he was laid to rest at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where he died.

The Queen was left with just two Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Willow and Holly, and two Dorgis, Candy and Vulcan.

The Dorgis are a cross-breed resulting from an unplanned liaison between a Corgi and Princess Margaret's Dachshund Pipkin.

When at Buckingham Palace, the dogs sleep in raised wicker baskets in a special boot room near the royal apartments, where they wander freely.

Sweet pup: Candy, a yellow Labrador, was a favourite of Prince Philip's for six years

Favourite breeds: The kennels at Sandringham, established by Edward VII in 1879 to house 100 dogs, are now home to Gundogs, Labradors and Cocker Spaniels

When the Queen is being fitted for a dress, Country Life reports, she carries a special magnet to pick up pins and save her precious Corgis from pricking their paws.

At Balmoral, the young Elizabeth would take the Corgis out onto the moor to help find grouse.

However, although the corgis were expert at locating the shot birds in the heather, they had difficulty retrieving them. So she would watch them wind the game and then rush over to retrieve the grouse herself.

The Queen thinks of the names for all the puppies at the kennels. One of her current labradors, Gryffindor, is from a litter named after Harry Potter characters.
