One sorority sister was being sued by another after a confrontation over a boyfriend led to a vicious, bloody cat fight with the girls repeatedly punching each other in the head and tearing out hair, according to court documents.

Kristin Saban, daughter of legendary University of Alabama football coach Nick Saban, was being sued for $10,000 by fellow Phi Mu sister Sarah Grimes, who claims the two attacked each other over a Facebook post following a night of drinking games.

The lawsuit was filed late last month in Tuscaloosa by Miss Grimes, who attends the $36,000-a-year University of Alabama with Miss Saban.

The incident happened on August 28, 2010 after tit-for-tat bickering led to Kristen posting on Facebook: 'No one likes Sarah! Yayyyyy!'. Miss Grimes is alleged to have replied: 'Well if she touches me, I'll kill her.'

The heated verbal exchange then erupted, with
Kristin shoving her sorority sister into a door and slamming her head, 
according to court documents seen by Gawker. 

Sarah reacted, pushing back and saying: 'Don't touch me.'

Kristen then repeatedly punched Sarah in the face as she screamed: 'I'm calling the cops!'

Miss Saban kept a firm grip on Miss Grimes' hair as the two wrestled down the hallway.

Kristen continued to rain blows on Sarah's face, despite attempts of fellow sorority students to separate the pair.

In the end it took two girls to pull Kristen off Sarah, whose nose was now streaming with blood. 

Grimes suffered numerous injuries that an emergency room doctor said 
could have killed her, the lawsuit claimed.

The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of at least $10,000 but doesn't mention the football coach Saban or his wife Terry.

An attorney for Kristen Saban filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Thursday, blaming the altercation on Grimes and claiming the coach's daughter acted only in self-defence.

Kristen Saban's motion said she didn't cause any of Grimes' injuries.

A representative of the coach declined comment. A lawyer for Grimes, Stephen Strickland, called the lawsuit 'a private matter'.

'It's not about Nick Saban, it's not about Miss Terry. It's about two individuals who used to be sorority sisters and friends,' Strickland said.

Both women remain students at the University of Alabama, he added.

The lawsuit claimed Grimes and Kristen Saban were playing a drinking game called 'Power Hour' - where students drink at the end of every song on YouTube - with friends on August 28, 2010.

Around midnight they went to a 
Tuscaloosa bar called Rounders, where Kristen became enraged because an 
on-off boyfriend was not paying her enough attention, according to the 
suit.

The group went to a house after last call at the bar and Kristen Saban became emotional, the suit said.

While lying on the floor with two 
other young women the coach's daughter began saying 'how everyone did 
not understand ''how it was'' for her ... ,' the complaint noted.

'After Kristen refused to get off the floor after several people had tried to help her, Sarah looked over at Kristen and said, ''Kristen, please just shut up. We're all sick and tired of hearing it,"' according to the suit.

Sarah claims the altercation began when she told Kristen: 'That's fine, but we're done, you're crazy.'

Grimes contends the other woman punched her repeatedly in the head, grabbed her neck and pulled her hair, leaving her bloody, swollen and bruised.

Friends took Grimes to the emergency room at DCH Regional Medical Center, which is adjacent to the university campus. There, both city and university police and the university's dean of students showed up in response to an assault call.

Tuscaloosa police Sgt. Brent Blankley said officers went to the hospital and filled out a report.

'The victim stated she did not want to prosecute in the case and the case was closed,' he said, declining further comment.

University spokeswoman Cathy Andreen said Kristen Saban remains a student but declined further comment, citing privacy rules.

The suit said Grimes was hurt so badly she suffered a concussion, an increase in migraine headaches, had nasal surgery and required psychological help.

'As a result of the beating and the head injuries Sarah Grimes sustained by Kristen Saban, Sarah has had repeated night terrors, anxiety, physical trembling, fears of dying from brain injuries, trouble sleeping, and intrusive recollections of the event,' the lawsuit said.

Kristen Saban's lawyer argued that Grimes was responsible for her own injuries.

The dismissal motion also said insurance covered Grimes' medical costs, so Kristen Saban shouldn't have to pay.

Kristen Saban pleaded guilty to an unspecified offense before the university's judicial board but was not prosecuted criminally, according to the suit. It said she was required to undergo psychological screening and take an anger management class.

A 2009 news release from the university about sorority recruitment identified both Grimes, of Pensacola, Florida, and Kristen Saban as new members of Phi Mu.
