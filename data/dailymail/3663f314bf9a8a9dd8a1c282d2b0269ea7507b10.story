Gary Rintel loved his collie Astro so much he cloned him into two more pooches - and now neighbors claim the duplicate doggies are running wild over Manhattan's Upper West Side.

Area residents complain the dogs are left to roam Central Park without a leash, and are prone to attacking people.

Though there's a leash law in New York City, Rintel - who also turned his beloved dog into a fur hat - admits he doesn't pay it any heed and has paid $2,000 in tickets over the last year as he often lingers a block behind the dogs on walks.

Double trouble: Gary Rintel is seen walking his cloned dogs Retro and Cosmo towards Central Park without a leash amid residents' complaints that the dogs are prone to attack people

Law: Rintel told reporters he doesn't care about the Central Park leash law and is happy to let his collie's run free

'This
is a tragedy waiting to happen,' said an unidentified man who told the New York Post the dogs 
charged at his puppy and bit his him. 'The city knows about this 
problem and does nothing. The law has no teeth, so to speak.'

Central Park mandates that dogs be on leashes between 9am and 9pm.

Rintel, who made a hat out of Astro's fur after the dog passed away in 2006, does not care.

'If you were a dog, would you want to live with a rope around your 
neck?' he asked. 'I don’t think most people care about their 
dogs’ happiness. Sometimes I’m guilty of breaking that law.'

Rintel regularly takes the collies for three-hour walks through the park to chase after rats and squirrels.

Cloned: The first commercially cloned dogs were announced at National Seoul University in 2009, shortly before Rintel paid $140,000 to clone his beloved Asto

Calling himself a trust-fund layabout and a single writer, Rintel made headlines on a reality show about his love of Astro, a short-haired collie/great Pyrenees mix.

Rintel paid paid $140,000 four years ago for a lab to insert Astro's frozen DNA into a donor egg to be placed into a surrogate.

40 months later, Cosmo and Retro were born.

Their master may love them, but so far he's the only one.

'The
second I see that guy, I make sure to cross the street,' said Jarrod 
Mittan, 29. 'He ignores his dogs as they’re bounding down the sidewalk, 
and he screams at them as though they understand what he’s saying.'

'They look like lions in the jungle. They roam free,' one unnamed super complained.

'We
call them the clones,' said a dog owner who claims Cosmo and Retro 
attacked his black Lab puppy in Central Park. He said that when he tried to break it up, one of the clones bit his hand.

In that case at least, Rintel supposedly apologized.

'The
guy said to me, ‘I’m sorry, my dogs have never done anything like that 
before,’' the victim said. 'Then he walked away — with the dogs 
still off the leash!'

Even Rintel's former dog-walker, Melinda Pillon, said once the malicious mutts were off the leash she saw them bite a cyclist.

Despite the complaints Rintel called them 'good boys' and said the walker wasn’t 
paying attention. He also denied that the Labrador’s owner had been bitten.

'It seems like dirty pool to manufacture an incident 
just because you’re upset my dog jumped on yours,' he said. 'They’re not threatening or 
dangerous dogs. They’re playful and they’re under check. The 
idea that two dogs are savaging the Upper West Side isn’t true.'
