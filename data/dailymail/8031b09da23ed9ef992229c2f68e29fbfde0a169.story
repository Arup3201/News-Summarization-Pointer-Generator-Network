Tragic: Anne-Marie Ellement claimed she was branded a liar after saying she was raped by two colleagues

The sister of a woman soldier who hanged herself after saying two colleagues raped her has demanded the Armed Forces watchdog launch an independent investigation.

Military policewoman Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, was found dead at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury, 
Wiltshire, on October 9 last year, shortly after returning from sick 
leave.

Her sister Sharon Hardy yesterday made a formal complaint - and demanded that the Service Complaints Commissioner looks into the case.

Anne-Marie, originally from Bournemouth, was the alleged victim of a drunken sex attack by 
two serving soldiers in her unit when they were posted together to Germany.

No one was ever charged in connection with the alleged attack which was dismissed by prosecutors in January 2010.

The Corporal also claimed she was bullied by other soldiers after making the complaint.

Ms Hardy has called for the tragedy to be re-investigated. She said she entrusted her sister to the care of the Armed Forces.

In her letter handed to The Times, Ms Hardy said that her sister's life was 'being made hell' while she was in the military.

The Royal Military Police, who investigated the rape claim, have launched an internal investigation to look at whether any actions that were taken by personnel were 'wrong or inappropriate'.

The Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA), outside the army, examined the evidence gathered by the military police but no further
action was taken.

The Army are also considering whether to launch a Services Inquiry to look at lessons that can be learned from the case.

In her letter to the watchdog, Ms Hardy said that her sister was happy when she first joined the army.

'Annie-Marie joined the Army a happy, confident young lady with hopes and dreams for the future, embarking on a career which several of her family members had joined,' she wrote.

'I trusted her into your care, giving her the support and encouragement to join the armed forces.'

She claimed that following the alleged rape, Anne-Marie's witness statement was altered before the SPA decided no charges should be brought.

She added: 'I am led to believe one main witness changed her statement and this was passed on to the SPA who felt there was no longer enough evidence to prosecute.'

Ms Hardy has asked to know whether her sister was drunk at the time of the alleged rape.

An inquest ruled last month that she took her own life.

It is the role of the Service Complaints Commissioner to look at her complaint and analyse the comments the coroner made when he recorded his verdict, before deciding whether to pursue the case.

Demand: The sister of Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, has demanded an independent investigation

After the inquest, Sharon Hardy said her sister was a ‘shadow of her former self’ after the rape allegation was dismissed.

Sharon
Hardy said after the inquest her sister was a 'shadow of her former self' after the rape allegation was dismissed.

'In my opinion Anne-Marie never recovered.

'No one believed her and her friends in the Army had turned on her, thinking she was making it up.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence has stressed that the Army has a 'zero tolerance policy to bullying and harassment'.

The inquest heard Anne-Marie was struggling to cope with working an 80-hour week when she was found hanged.

She
told friends and family that she was called in on duty on her weekends 
off and even when she was signed off on sick leave with stress.

And
she said she was belittled and slated by colleagues for her work, with 
one even writing criticisms on the social networking site Facebook.

She also learned on Facebook that an ex-boyfriend had started seeing someone else.

The inquest heard that 
Anne-Marie had always wanted to be in the Army and joined the Royal 
Military Police in 2006.

She served in both 
Northern Ireland and Germany before being posted to Bulford Camp after 
making an allegation of rape against two male colleagues.

While with 158 Provost Company she was described as a 'competent' investigator who was finding her role
as shift commander a 'challenge'.

In
recording his verdict, Ian Singleton, Assistant Deputy Coroner for 
Wiltshire and Swindon, said: 'Anne-Marie had a difficult time in the Army
including an allegation that she was the victim of rape.

'She
was signed off work with stress on September 19 and complained to her 
senior officer she felt that she could do nothing right and was not 
receiving the credit for the work and long hours she put in.'
