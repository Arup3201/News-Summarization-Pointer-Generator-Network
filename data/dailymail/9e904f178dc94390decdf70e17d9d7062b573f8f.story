Former First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, was caught in the wind as she arrived at JFK airport in New York earlier today.

Casually dressed in a black blazer jacket, jeans and black knee-high boots, the 45-year-old Italian-French beauty covered her face in a pair of huge sunglasses as her hair whipped about her face.

Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy tweeted earlier today that she was ‘Editor for one day’ of women’s lifestyle website AuFeminin.com, the French equivalent of SoFeminine.co.uk.

In an interview with the women’s 
lifestyle website the former model spoke of body image, addressing the 
drastic move by Angelina Jolie to undergo a double mastectomy after 
finding out she has an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer as a
carrier of the BRCA1 gene.

Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy said although she 
‘understands’ why Ms Jolie chose to speak openly about her operation, 
she added that it was ‘very American’ of her.

‘The message from Angelina Jolie is 
also: take charge of your destiny,’ the mother-of-two told AuFeminine.com, adding that 
it had not lessened Angelina’s femininity.

‘I really believe that femininity is something more than breasts, buttocks, hair ... femininity is a power.

The fact that we work, and take our place in society gives us a charm, and impacts our generation,’ she said.

Carla also spoke of the changes in fashion and on the catwalk, lamenting the large number of teenage models.

'These girls have a prepubescent shape
and they are in danger as they grow up, as they are being judged [on 
the catwalk] on a body that is not final.'

'As they grow up, they submit to the 
constrains of the system, only to find that their body will not,' she 
said, adding that 17 should be the minimum age for a model.

The model-turned-singer released her fourth album Little French Songs in April, which reached number two in France.

She attracted controversy when one 
song - Le Pinguoin - appeared to be mocking her husband's political 
rival Francois Hollande, who unseated him as president.

The lyrics 'neither ugly nor 
beautiful, neither tall nor short, neither hot nor cold, the penguin, 
neither yes or no,' were taken to be a dig at Hollande's nickname Mr 
Neither-Yes-Or-No.
