One of the ‘beautiful women’ that Ferris Bueller actor Ben Stein revealed he had a ‘mad crush’ on in a bizarre essay he penned last month has hit back at the former Nixon speechwriter.

In a column for The American Spectator, the former New York Times writer, who has been married to attorney Alexandra Denman for 45 years, wrote about women he met on a recent speaking tour in California.

Among them was an 'absolute knockout young Eurasian woman', who Stein also referred to as ‘Lucia’ and a former ‘call girl’.

The Yale-educated former Nixon speech writer wrote that he was immediately smitten after first setting eyes on her at the San Francisco airport in the spring.

She was ‘a stunningly beautiful, absolute knockout young Eurasian woman,’ Stein wrote, and ‘we have been in touch almost every day since.’

The woman, a 24-year-old pregnant performance artist called Tanya Ma, has now told the New York Post that Stein gave her money and then begged to ‘touch’ her even though she’s pregnant.

‘It’s much more than sexting, cyber-escorting or being a sugar daddy - it’s unhealthy and toxic behavior that needs to be exposed,’ said Ma, who lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Tanya, who admits she briefly worked as an escort in Chicago, said that she and Stein texted for about four months before he asked me to send him pictures.

‘He said he was very captivated and he just wanted to remember me. After a while, he started asking for more racy photos,’ she told the Post.

In his June column for The American Spectator, Stein wrote about a never-ending string of beautiful women he met as he traveled.

'My main obsessions in my life are my 
wife, my dog, my son and his family, my secret GF from Mississippi, and 
any beautiful girl I meet,' he wrote. 'I am like a teenager. I get mad 
crushes.'

He
 wrote that woman - now revealed by the Post as Ma - asked him to help her become a writer but he said there was little
 he could do.

After meeting, they texted daily before she revealed that she was 
pregnant by a man she'd had a brief relationship with.

Married: He has been married to attorney Alexandra Denman for 45 years and insisted that she always knows about the women he meets and speaks to. He said there was no sexting scandal

'I'll just be a single mom,' she texted him. 'Will you help me out?'

He wrote: 'I am so pro-life that I can never say no in these cases but I am worried about it.'

He wrote that he considered flying her to
 his hometown of Los Angeles to go out for 'a lovely dinner' with him 
and his wife - until she insisted on staying at the expensive Beverly 
Wilshire.

But Ma tells a different story and reportedly showed the Post texts in which Stein wrote that he wanted to touch and kiss.

'When you get here i want to hug and kiss you. I understand you don’t want to f–k me. But i want to touch you and kiss you,' read one text.

She texted back: 'Ben, you may hug me and feel my baby bump, but anything more is too much for me. I’m not your girlfriend. Can’t we simply enjoy a conversation and meal? I’m pregnant.'

Then Stein responded, 'Your note hurts my feelings. Insulting. Shows zero appreciation.'

On Monday, Stein denied to The Post that he ever did anything untoward.

'She is a person I have only met for less than five minutes at an airport. I have never touched her, I have never had any sexual contact with her. I should get a medal for helping this woman,' he said.

Speaking previously to Business Insider, he had claimed that the story had only surfaced because he made 'the unfortunate mistake of meeting a very
 vengeful human being who’s very angry that she did not get to stay at 
the Beverly Wilshire'.

He added 
that he has been writing 'or at least 40 years about the interesting 
people I meet' and that his 'secret gf' line had simply been a joke.

But he admitted that he had communicated with the women after meeting them and did sometimes send them money.

'They don't even remotely have to be romantically involved with me for me to help them or communicate with them,' he said.

Still, he claimed that his wife knew everything about his flirtations and found the latest press coverage funny.

MailOnline had reached out to Stein's representative for comment and was awaiting a response.
