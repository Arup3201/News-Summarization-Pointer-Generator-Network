The Duchess of Cambridge is said to have returned to the Middleton's Berkshire home to spend the final days of her pregnancy with her family.

Now one day past her due date, Kate Middleton is reported to have travelled to her parent's £4.85million mansion on Friday to enjoy some home comforts before becoming a mother.

The last-minute move would mean the Duchess would face a 50 mile drive to her labour suite in Queen Mary's hospital in Paddington, London.

Speculation
 that the Royal baby would be overdue reached fever pitch last week when
 Prince William announced he will play in two charity polo matches this 
weekend.

The news comes as the nation waits on tenterhooks for news of the Royal baby, which was officially due yesterday.

Police cars were reportedly seen 
outside Carole and Michael Middleton's home and are said to be on hand 
to escort the heavily pregnant Duchess to hospital when she goes into 
labour, according to the Sunday Express.

A royal source told the newspaper: 'Being back at home is the one place where Kate can truly relax.

'She knows her mum will take good care of her and Williamk can also rest assured that she's in safe hands.'

The last-minute move takes Kate more than an hour's drive away from St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, where she plans to give birth.

Kate's retreat to the countryside is said to confirm rumours that she does not expect the baby to arrive this weekend.

William’s decision suggested that he is now more confident that his first-born is not about to make an appearance this weekend.

Family-oriented Kate has bucked royal tradition in the past, in favour of spending time with her family.

Her parents recently bought a 
Georgian manor in rural Berkshire with plenty of space for their first 
grandchild to run around.

Kate and her husband famously chose to spend Christmas Day at her parents’ home instead of the Queen's Sandringham estate.

Early in her pregnancy, the Duchess even considered giving birth to the future monarch as a hospital near her parents' home, but decided against it.

She will spend the first six weeks after leaving hospital at her parent's home and will not employ a maternity nurse.

Sources
have confirmed that William and Kate’s plans to move into a new 
apartment in Kensington Palace in time for the birth have hit a huge 
stumbling block.

This 
follows the discovery of asbestos – which has to be cleared before the 
couple themselves, let alone a new-born child, can set foot inside.
