Rafa Benitez's Napoli have it all to do in the second leg of this Champions League qualifier after  Athletic Bilbao nabbed an all-important away goal and earned a 1-1 draw in Italy.

Bilbao, competing in the Champions League for the first time in more than 15 years, had Benitez on the brink of elimination but the former Liverpool and Chelsea manager was given  hope by a second-half equaliser from Argentina striker Gonzalo Higauin.

That was  after Iker Muniain's composed finish in the first gave  Bilbao the lead against a shadow of a Napoli side the 60,000 fans at the Stadio San Paolo are used to seeing.

A Bilbao team that were deemed to have lost their best player in Ander Herrera to Manchester United during the summer looked as comfortable as ever during the first half in Naples. 

Bilbao should have punished the home side  27 minutes in when an in-swinging corner found an unmarked Aymeric Laporte, but the defender failed to place his header beyond goalkeeper Rafael.

That was soon forgotten when they took a deserved lead four minutes from the break.

A surging Oscar de Marcos run down the right saw the midfielder square the ball to Muniain who, 10 yards out and with defenders approaching, was the epitome of cool.

A first touch to set himself and a second to pass it into the bottom-right corner, the attacker  made it 1-0.

Half time arrived, and Napoli had failed to register a single shot on target. In a competition where away goals come at twice the price, a change was needed. 

Yet Benitez decided against making a substitute, leaving season-long loan-signing Michu from Swansea City to look on from the bench for the time being.

Catch me if you can: Gonzalo Higuain looked off the pace for the majority of the game but scored the equaliser

Celebration: Higuain saved Napoli's blushes in the 1-1 draw after competing for Argentina at the World Cup

Saved: The Argentina striker must now go to Spain with Napoli needing to score against Bilbao to survive the tie

It was France-born Higuain who saved Napoli's blushes as the striker, with three defenders for company,  squeezed his shot away into the far corner to make it 1-1. The relief was there for all to see.

The home side should have made it 2-1 less than five minutes later when Jose Callejon, having beaten the offside trap, only had Gorka Iraizoz between him and goal. Yet the midfielder  only sent his shot  wide.

Michu came on and could have made himself an instant hero, only to  pass to a marked Higuain instead of slotting the ball home from less than 10 yards out. It was the strangest of decisions from the 28-year-old with the goal gaping. 

Napoli began to look more like the home side that had lost just two Serie A games in 29 at this venue, but could not find a way past a determined Iraizoz in the Bilbao goal.

The game returns for the second leg in Spain this Wednesday.

Making a point: Benitez must travel to Spain with his Napoli side and score against Bilbao as it stands at 1-1

Happy with that? Bilbao return to Spain with the advantage after their first Champions League game in 15 years
