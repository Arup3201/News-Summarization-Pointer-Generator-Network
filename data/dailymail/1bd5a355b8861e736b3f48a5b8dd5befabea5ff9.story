At least 19 people were killed today when a bomb blast destroyed a bus in Pakistan.

Seven women and a child were among the dead, said local police investigating the explosion near the city of Peshawar in the north-west of the country.

Forty-two others were injured in the attack, which targeted government workers, and rescuers warned that the death toll could rise further.

One survivor described how he was covered in the blood of other victims as the bomb tore the bus apart.

No group has claimed responsibility for the atrocity, although the Pakistan Taliban and its network of militants have carried out similar bombings in the past.

The bus was filled with commuting government employees when the bomb was detonated.

Mohammed Javed, 35, who was on board, said he was covered in the blood of other victims.

Speaking as he was treated at a local hospital, Mr Javed added: 'Luckily I was in the front part of the bus, and the bomb went off in the back.

'Something hit me in the shoulder, but I kept my senses and started helping badly hurt people.'

Witnesses said they saw body parts scattered around the smouldering wreck of the bus.

Jalal Khan, 14, was standing in the aisle of the crowded bus when the bomb went off, and his right arm was slashed by a piece of metal.

'We all fell on the floor of the bus, and people were crying for help,' he said.

'I was unable to see anything because there was a lot smoke, and I was having trouble breathing.'

Local officials said they believed the bomb had been hidden underneath the rear of the bus.

Television footage showed residents shuttling bloodied victims to hospital in taxis, trucks and other private vehicles.

Officials wheeled one woman into the 
hospital on a stretcher. She was covered by a blanket, and her clothes 
were soaked with blood.

The attack came one day after a 
remote-controlled bomb killed at least 15 people outside a madrassah in 
the south-western city of Quetta.

Pakistan has been battling a home-grown insurgency since 2007, which has claimed some 5,000 lives.

Iftikhar Hussain, the information minister for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Peshawar is the capital, said the government would continue to target militants if attacks did not stop.

He said: 'For the sake of protecting people, we are always ready for negotiation, but if the terrorists are not ready to stop, the only option left for the government is to go for a massive operation against the terrorists wherever they are.'
