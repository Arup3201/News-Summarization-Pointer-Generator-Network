Over the course of a year, 2.2 million flights blanket the skies above the UK - peaking at 8,000 in a single day.

These flights are managed by NATS (formerly known as National Air Traffic Services), which is responsible for monitoring airspace above more than 180 public and private airports, military training flights centres and helipads.

To put this 'spider's web' of traffic into perspective, NATS has produced the third in its series of air traffic visualisations, taking a tour of the UK’s airspace, called UK 24.

More than 2.2 million flights are managed by the Swanwick and Prestwick-based NATS, formerly known as National Air Traffic Services in airspace over the UK (pictured). Flights peak at more than 8,000 a day and the visualisation plots 7,000 of these movements

‘Following the success of our two data visualisations - Europe 24 and North Atlantic Skies - we’ve taken a lot of time to think about where to go next,’ said head of operational policy, Brendan Kelly. 

‘Both Europe 24 and North Atlantic Skies were designed to give an overview of the daily complexity and volumes of air traffic across the UK and Europe and to do so in a way that was cinematic and exciting to watch.

‘I think we were able to do that to great effect, but we now want to take you a little deeper.

‘We are therefore very excited to publish UK 24 - your guided tour to some of what makes UK aviation work.’

During the visualisation, around 7,000 flights are shown entering and leaving UK airspace.

The day starts with the bow wave of transatlantic traffic heading towards the UK on organised and separated tracks.

This is joined by traffic from Europe and the first waves of departures from UK airports.

Traffic levels are then seen growing to reveal the main ‘trunk roads’, or routes, of airspace as well as the hubs around London, Manchester and central Scotland.

The visualisation then shows holding stacks over London, also known as a holding manoeuvre that is used to delay a flight from landing, but keep it within the airspace.  

The tour then moves around the UK to include the other major airports and NATS’ two control centres in Swanwick and Prestwick.

There are also visualisations of military training flights, showing RAF jets performing manoeuvres training off the east coast of England and near to North Wales.

It then reveals a ‘spider’s web of helicopter tracks’ originating in Aberdeen, taking people and supplies to  North Sea oil and gas rigs.

This is particularly key around Heathrow, continued Mr Kelly, which provides ‘the constant flow of traffic that makes it the world’s busiest dual runway airport with 1,350 movements a day.’

At Heathrow alone, goods worth £133 billion were shipped in and out last year, more than the combined value of goods transiting through the UK’s two largest ports, Felixstowe and Southampton.

The tour then moves around the UK to include the other major airports, NATS’ two control centres in Swanwick and Prestwick, and general aviation traffic.

There are also visualisations of military training flights, showing RAF jets performing training manoeuvres off the east coast of England and near to north Wales.

‘We hope you enjoy this insight into the complexity and beauty of a day of UK air traffic and the value of airspace as the invisible infrastructure that makes it all work,’ added Mr Kelly.

To create the video, visualisation experts from a company called 422 South combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all UK flights.

Computer artists then used specially developed software to convert the longitude, latitude and height data into luminous dots, which were accurately positioned over satellite images of Britain, by day and by night.

Earlier this year, NATS and 422 South, released a similar video called North Atlantic Skies.

It showed 2,524 flights crossing the North Atlantic, of which 1,273 pass through the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area. At its busiest, traffic can peak at 1,500 flights a day in the summer.

NATS, from its control centre in Prestwick, is responsible for providing the air traffic control service to the Shanwick OCA, which is the busiest of all North Atlantic Airspace regions.

Around 80 per cent of all North Atlantic Air Traffic passes through it. 

The firm's Europe visualisation was an amalgamation of UK radar data, taken on 21 June 2013, combined with European flight plan information from 28 July last year.

According to NATS, of the 30,000 flights that travel across European airspace on a typical July day, approximately a quarter fly within UK controlled airspace.

The total distance flown by these aircraft is 25 million nautical miles - the equivalent to 998 times around the Earth or 104 trips to the Moon.

On 21 June 2013, 5,675 aircraft departed or arrived from UK airports, this included 847 from Gatwick and 1,041 from Heathrow. 

The rest (1,532) were classed as overflights which travelled over the country. The NATS video is 1440x faster than real time.
