While they might seem poles apart, the lexicon of beauty is surprisingly similar to the jargon of DIY. From brushes, gloss and varnish to primers, tape and files, it’s all about preparing the surface and then making it more attractive.

In a DIY store last week, I noticed the similarity between sandpaper and the foot file I use for removing rough skin off my feet — but at a fraction of the price.

It made me wonder if B&Q could actually be the cut-price beauty store I’d been searching for. I decided to experiment, with some fascinating results . . .

BODY BRUSH

Beauty: Elemis Skin Brush, £21, timetospa.co.uk

B&Q: 5-inch Masonry Brush, £3

Every beauty expert I’ve met swears by body brushing — using a stiff bristle brush in sweeping strokes, working from the tips of your toes and fingers towards the heart. It’s said to boost lymphatic drainage, resulting in less water retention, and promote circulation so skin looks more radiant. Some people even believe it can improve the appearance of cellulite.

Normally I use the Elemis Skin Brush but I thought that a stiff plastic-bristled masonry brush could do the job just as well. And while it’s definitely less aesthetically pleasing, the bristles feel just like more expensive cactus ones of the Elemis version, although they bend more easily because they’re longer.

Winner: B&Q —although only after I’d cut the bristles down to half their size. But when you’re saving £18, it’s worth a little effort.

FAST-DRYING HAIR TOWEL

Beauty: Aquis Lisse Hair Towel, £14.95, amazon.co.uk

B&Q: Kent Car Care Extra Large Chamois Leather, £12.78

Hair obsessives rave about microfibre towels that absorb water from the hair more quickly than normal towels.

I’ve never been particularly convinced that mine does this. Working on the principle that a chamois leather, usually used for washing cars, readily soaks up water, I used one, as I do the towel, to create a turban after washing my hair. The results were miraculous.

Fifteen minutes later, most of my hair was dry, in half the time it usually takes. The wet leather smelled a bit, well, leathery, but didn’t make my hair smell odd.

Winner: B&Q. I’m chucking out my microfibre towel.

FAKE TAN APPLICATOR

Beauty: St Tropez Applicator Mitt, £5, sttropeztan.co.uk

B&Q: Mini Roller & Tray Set, £2.75

To avoid stained palms, the only way to apply fake tan is with a mitt — a pocket with a plasticised inside and a fabric exterior.

Rather than squirting some of my usual mousse onto a mitt, I poured a little liquid tan into the tray of a miniature roller set and set about covering my legs. It was useless. The roller soaked up far too much liquid, and the coverage was patchy. Perhaps a paint pad, less absorbent than a roller, but also used for daubing walls, would have been better?

Winner: Beauty — efficient, if less fun than decorating yourself.

FAKE TAN MITT

Beauty: St Tropez Buffing Mitt, £3.57, sttropeztan.co.uk

B&Q: Kent Home Care Microfibre Mitt, £1.38

If you’ve never been for a professional fake tan, you might not have encountered a finishing mitt.

When you have been sprayed a deep mahogany colour, the therapist takes a soft mitt and pats down your skin, gently buffing away tell-tale streaks, rather as if you were a newly-waxed Bentley. It might sound absurd, but it makes the difference between a good finish and a perfect finish, so I now do the same at home.

I used a mitt designed for polishing a car. Apart from being bright blue, rather than tasteful black, and about twice the size of the St Tropez version, it worked brilliantly. The microfibre fabric felt soft against my skin and the internal seam, which allows you to put fingers either side.

Winner: B&Q — easy to use and covers a bigger area.

FRENCH MANICURE NAIL STICKERS

Beauty: 96 Nailene Perfect French Tip Guides, £3.05

B&Q: Masking tape, £1.76

While expert manicurists might be able to create the perfect French manicure — pale pink with white tips — we more cack-handed types often turn to little stickers that act as a guide so you get a perfect line.

It’s what decorators do with masking tape, but on a smaller scale. Using masking tape on my nails gave a straight line rather than the traditional curved one, but the tape stuck well to the nail, the polish didn’t seep underneath, and I quite liked that the straight line gave a more modern effect.

Winner: B&Q — though if you’re a purist, you might want to shell out for curved stickers.

CLEANSING CLOTHS

Beauty: Three Muslin Cleansing Cloths, £14, evelom.com

B&Q: Ten Dishcloths, £1.98

Eve Lom’s waxy cleanser, launched in 1983, pioneered the trend for greasy, balm-like cleansers that are removed with warm water and a muslin cleansing cloth.

Now everyone from Elemis to Boots and Liz Earle does a hot-cloth cleanser. The problem is that even if you regularly boil-wash them, the pricey cloths soon become grubby.

Could a regular cotton dishcloth do the same job? I’ve been using one for a week and I’ll never go back to muslin again. The cotton was soft on my face and gives a gentle exfoliation.

Winner: B&Q — much as I love Eve Lom, I won’t be paying the best part of £5 for muslin when a 20p cloth does the same thing.

FLEXIBLE ROLLERS

Beauty: 12 Bendy Rollers, £4.09, superdrug.com

B&Q: Verve 7m Plant Twist Tie, £4

Years ago, I used bendy rollers to create soft curls. It was simple: you took the curler — essentially a wire-covered sponge — wound a towel-dried section of hair round it, starting at the bottom and working toward the roots, and then bent over the ends of the roller to hold the hair in place.

Then you let the hair dry before releasing the curls. I thought padded wire for plants might be able to do the same thing. I knew the wire was thinner than the normal rollers, but thought bending it over on itself might work.

But although I managed to wrap my hair around it, no matter how many ways I bent it, the hair wouldn’t stay put. And, to make matters worse, the rubber coating on the wire gripped the hair and caused it to pull and tangle.

Winner: Beauty — bendy rollers are a relatively simple design, but they’ve proved they’re more than just a twist of wire.

FOUNDATION BRUSH

Beauty: Urban Decay Good Karma Optical Blurring Brush, £18, debenhams.com

B&Q: Harris 25mm Paint Brush, £3.98

The soft, tightly-packed bristles of Urban Decay’s brush do a wonderful job of buffing foundation into the skin so you get a flawless finish. The same couldn’t be said for the paintbrush I attempted to use in its place.

While actually it was pretty good at daubing my warpaint on and didn’t, to my surprise, leave streaks, it was scratchy and uncomfortable to use.

Winner: Beauty — unless you really want your foundation application to double as exfoliation.

FOOT FILE

Beauty: File A Foot, £5, thebodyshop.co.uk

B&Q: Norton Expert Angled Sanding Sponge Fine, £3.98

Surely I can’t be the only one who’s looked at an emery board or a foot file and thought, ‘Isn’t this just pricey sandpaper?’

I went for a fine-grained sanding sponge, worried that anything too gritty might actually draw blood. The angled block was ‘ideal for sanding contoured surfaces, corners and hard to reach areas’ — it sounded perfect.

I used the large surface on the bottom of my feet, and the pointed bit to tackle hard skin on the tips of my toes, and it was just as effective as my normal foot file.

Winner: A draw — while the block did exactly what I needed it to, and was much better at tackling toes, the foot file’s longer handle made it easier to scrub my heels.
