Three students have been charged with beating a woman during hazing rituals for a university marching band just three weeks before a drummer was killed in similar circumstances.

The assault by members of the Florida A&M University band was so severe that the victim's thigh bone was broken, police said today.

Sean Hobson, 23, Aaron Golson, 19, and James Harris, 22, are accused of punching Bria Shante Hunter and attacking her with a ruler.

Their actions were part of an 
initiation ritual to 'welcome' the 18-year-old into the 'Red Dawg 
Order', a band clique for students who come from Georgia.

Tallahassee
 police claim the assaults took place on October 31 and November 1 - 
less than three weeks before drummer Robert Champion collapsed outside 
an Orlando hotel and died. Investigators have linked his death to 
hazing.

Miss Hunter told 
police that days later the pain became so unbearable that she went to 
the hospital. Besides her broken thigh bone, she had suffered blood 
clots in her legs.

Hobson and Golson were yesterday charged with hazing and battery, and Harris was charged with hazing.

Champion's death and the latest charges have exposed a hazing tradition that has long haunted the university.

Former clarinet player Ivery Luckey was hospitalised after he said he was 'paddled' - or spanked around the buttocks - around 300 times in 1998.

Three years later, band member Marcus Parker suffered kidney damage because of a beating with a paddle.

After Mr Champion died, the university 
indefinitely suspended performances by the famed Marching 100 and school
 president James Ammons has vowed to break what he calls a 'code of 
silence' on the hazing rituals.

Unsafe: Band director Julian White was fired for being unable to stop the alleged hazing events. He has since been reinstated and placed on administrative leave after a request by police

All three arrested men were last night in jail. A university spokeswoman confirmed they were students.

Police
 claim that the hazing took place at Harris' off-campus apartment in 
Tallahassee and that at one point he stopped Golson and Hobson from 
hitting Miss Hunter further.

Miss Hunter was targeted by the other members of the Red Dawg Order because she tried to get out of going to a group meeting, officers said in their arresting documents.

She was repeatedly punched on the tops of her thighs by Golson and Hobson, according to information the police obtained from others who witnessed the incident.

The second beating came when Hunter and other pledges could not recite information about the Red Dawg Order properly. It was during that one that a metal ruler was used on Miss Hunter's legs.

Police say that Hobson sent Miss 
Hunter a text message on November 5 that stated 'I apologise for the 
hurt I put you through. I apologise for the mental and physical strain 
you have endured.'

Violence: Former bandmates and police recently told reporters that Mr Champion had walked through a line of band members who punched him before his death

When 
interviewed later by police, Hobson acknowledged he was a member of the 
Red Dawg Order but denied harming Miss Hunter or sending her a text 
message.

Harris also denied to police that he 
allowed his apartment to be used to hold the meetings and he denied 
seeing Miss Hunter getting hit.

After
 Mr Champion's death, the school fired band director Julian White, who 
contends he tried to report problems with hazing to his superiors.

He has since been reinstated and placed on administrative leave at the request of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which asked the university to halt all disciplinary actions until the criminal investigation is finished.

Four students connected to Mr Champion's death were expelled, but then reinstated at the request of the law enforcement agency.

Last week, the Board of Trustees reprimanded Ammons over his job performance, including how the university has dealt with hazing.

The panel that oversees the state university system has also called for a probe into whether school officials ignored past warnings about hazing.

'The Board of Trustees and President Ammons hope that through these arrests all involved in perpetuating this culture will really begin to view hazing as a serious matter,' said university spokeswoman Sharon Saunders.
