Many drivers think they will escape prosecution for texting at the wheel because they see so many others ‘getting away with it’, an RAC report reveals today.

Some 51 per cent of motorists believe it is unlikely that they will ever be penalised for sending texts while their car is stopped  in traffic.

Forty-two per cent think it is unlikely they will be caught texting while on the move, with 16 per cent believing it is ‘extremely unlikely’ they will be challenged.

Unlikely: Nearly half of drivers think it is unlikely they will be caught texting while on the move

And a shocking six out of ten of motorists are ignorant of the fact that texting at the wheel of a stationary car with the engine on is against the law despite the fact it has been illegal since 2003 for drivers to use a hand-held mobile phone.

More than half of motorists report regularly seeing other people texting in stationary traffic during half or some of their journeys, while nearly a third claim to see this during most journeys.

When it comes to drivers owning up to texting in stationary vehicles on the road, only one in 14  of motorists say they do, though this figure almost doubles to 15per cent for 17 to 24-year-olds.

One in six admit to not knowing texting and driving is illegal and one in five say do not know it is illegal to check Facebook and Twitter while driving. More than a quarter think it safe to text and look at social media sites when stationary with the engine running, despite this being illegal.

This is also despite research that shows texting at the wheel is more distracting than driving when drunk. Using a hand-held phone to text or speak at the wheel carries a £100 fixed penalty – recently increased from £60 - plus three points on the licence. Ministers have pledged to review this and impose a higher penalty if widespread abuse continues.

More broadly, 75per cent of motorists report regularly seeing other people talking on mobile phones with  nearly half saying they see this happening during most of their car journeys. Yet only 1 in 12 of drivers admit themselves to using a hand-held phone on most journeys.

More than a third of motorists are concerned about other drivers talking on hand-held mobile phones and more than one in five about other motorists breaking traffic laws generally.

But law-abiding motorists are deeply frustrated that law-breakers are being left to ‘get away with it’ because there are too few police on the road, according to the RAC report on Motoring for 2014.

By contrast they note how police and other authorities are happy to clamp down on speeding – because most of the work is done for them with automated cameras and requires little or no effort from actual officers.

The RAC mooring report concludes: ‘Many motorists in 21st century Britain think there is little risk of being caught breaking the law at the wheel for anything other than speeding or running a red light: offences typically enforced via cameras.’

It says four out of ten motorists believe anyone committing common offences such as texting at the wheel of either a moving or stationary vehicle, aggressive driving, tailgating, middle lane hogging on the motorway or undertaking would more than likely ‘get away with it’.

As a result 60per cent of motorists surveyed believe there are insufficient numbers of police officers on the roads to enforce driving laws. 

The RAC Motoring Report  notes: ‘While the vast majority of motorists are law-abiding, with only three million of more than 35.8m drivers having points on their licences, there seems to be a perception among many motorists – rightly or wrongly – that drivers won’t be caught if they flout the law.’ It notes: ‘This is especially the case with the use of mobile phones while driving.’

For the new offences of tailgating and middle lane hogging only a quarter and one in five respectively think motorists are likely to be pulled up by a traffic police officer.

For aggressive driving some 40per cent of motorists felt drivers would be unlikely to be caught, with 30per cent believing it likely.

For so-called ‘undertaking’ passing a car on the inside - the figures were 49per cent unlikely and only 20per-cent likely.

The report says: ‘The only offences that motorists truly believe are dealt with effectively are the ones that are enforced via cameras such as speeding and traffic light violations.’

Here nearly half think drivers will get caught for speeding and 46per cent for  running a red light. Of motorists with speeding points on their licences half say they were trapped by a speed camera, whereas only a quarter were caught by a police officer.

RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘Our research shows that millions of law-abiding motorists are frustrated with the reduction of traffic police and believe that the chances of drivers being pulled up for breaking the law are now minimal.

‘Motorists are tired of constantly seeing other drivers breaking the law and getting away with it so it is hardly surprising that they want to see a greater police presence on our roads to enforce motoring legislation more effectively, which would also act as a genuine deterrent. ‘
