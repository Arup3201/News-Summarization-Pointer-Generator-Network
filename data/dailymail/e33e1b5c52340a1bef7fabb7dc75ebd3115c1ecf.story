Norwich have had a re-think over their proposed loan of Graham Dorrans from West Bromwich Albion and will start his deal from February 22 so he can appear in the play-offs.

Dorrans was due to join Norwich on Thursday but the terms of his 93-day loan would have meant he was ineligible to appear for them in the play-offs in May should they make them.

Norwich are seventh in the table, nine points off leaders Middlesbrough and two behind sixth placed Brentford.

Dorrans will continue to do light training with West Bromwich Albion to maintain his fitness prior to joining up with the Carrow Road side. His move will become permanent in the summer for around £3.5million.

The Championship side discussed a deadline day transfer for the Scotland man but terms were not agreed in time to secure his to move to Carrow Road.

Dorrans has also interested Birmingham and Fulham but Norwich are leading the chase for his signature and are overwhelming favourites to land the 27-year-old.
