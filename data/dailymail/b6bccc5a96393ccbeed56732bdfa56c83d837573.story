A romantic getaway to Paris was ruined for one couple after easyJet refused to accept one of their passports - despite it still having a year to run.

Megan Meenan, 23, and her partner Adam Clarke, 25, from Derry, Northern Ireland, had booked a three-day trip to the French capital and were scheduled to fly out from Belfast Airport on Tuesday.

After passing through security and checking in their luggage, they had made it to the gate when they were asked to show their passports.

A romantic trip to Paris for Adam Clarke and his partner Megan Meenan was ruined when easyJet refused to accept the former's passport

After Miss Meenan was allowed to walk through to board the plane, Mr Clarke was told there was a problem with his passport.

An easyJet member staff called their manager four times to discuss the matter. 

Miss Meenan then claims the manager requested a second opinion from a worker who 'looked about 21' and Mr Clarke was told he wouldn't be permitted to board.

This was despite Mr Clarke's passport, which is the old British style issued nine years ago, still having a year to run until it expired. 

The AXA Insurance worker has used the passport on Norwegian, Ryanair, Thomson and an easyJet flight in the last 12 months.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Miss Meenan said: 'Four times the manager was contacted, but I find it bad that they couldn't even come down and inspect for themselves.

'They asked first to see some more ID, which Adam showed them his drivers' licence, and they agreed it was definitely him.

Adam Clarke's passport photo and the copy inside is clear and visible, but the front is, as his partner Megan Meenan accepts, 'tatty'

'When the manager asked for a second opinion, I overheard the staff member saying that they 'wouldn't accept it'.

'The passport is nine years old and obviously looks a bit tatty, but it clearly shows who he is and isn't falling apart.

'To add insult to the situation, I was told I could proceed as there was no problem with my passport.'

Miss Meenan, who was travelling to Paris for the first time, describes how the incident had left her in tears, and she demanded to see the manager.

Sadly for Adam and Megan, they never got to enjoy their romantic trip to Paris

'As we were going to see the manager, I could see the plane taking off and I was just so upset,' she added.

'When we met them, we were told as a "goodwill gesture" that we could re-book flights for later in the day for £65 each, but that they 'couldn't guarantee' Adam's passport would be accepted.

'So instead of walking around Paris, and going through all the activities we planned, we were instead going back home.'

University of Ulster Masters student Miss Heenan told MailOnline Travel that  in correspondence with easyJet since the incident the airline has incorrectly called them 'Agnes and Andy' and has offered a goodwill gesture of airport taxes back - £54, minus £10 for processing the form.

'They said the passport had looked like it had been through a washing machine, but it hadn't,' added Miss Meenan.

'EasyJet have told us they are standing by what their ground staff said, which I find very upsetting.

'When you are sitting at the gate, you never think it could be you who misses the flight in tears, but that was what happened.'

A spokesperson for easyJet said: 'easyJet works closely with the authorities and complies with their guidance to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and staff.

'easyJet cannot allow any passenger to travel on their planned flight with documentation damaged to such a degree that its authenticity is brought into question. It is the passenger's responsibility to have suitable documentation for travel.'

'We would like to apologise for any inconvenience.'
