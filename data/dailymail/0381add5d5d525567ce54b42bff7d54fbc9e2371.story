Team news

Stoke

Stoke manager Mark Hughes has virtually a full squad to choose from ahead of Monday's Barclays Premier League clash with Newcastle at the Britannia Stadium.

Midfielder Jonathan Walters is the only doubt as he will undergo a late fitness test on a calf problem that has sidelined him for the last two weeks.

Stoke's Peter Crouch will be hoping to repeat his goalscoring feats at QPR against Newcastle on Monday

The game comes too soon for defender Geoff Cameron (hernia) who is nearing a return, whilst striker Peter Odemwingie (knee) is a long-term casualty.

Provisional Squad: Begovic, Bardsley, Wilson, Shawcross, Pieters, Whelan, Walters, Krkic, Moses, Nzonzi, Crouch, Sorensen, Huth, Adam, Arnautovic, Assaidi, Biram Diouf, Muniesa, Ireland.

Newcastle

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will hope to restore big guns Tim Krul, Yoan Gouffran and Papiss Cisse to his starting line-up at Stoke on Monday evening.

The trio missed the Capital One Cup third-round victory at Crystal Palace in midweek because of illness and could return, while Pardew will keep his fingers crossed over full-back Daryl Janmaat, who suffered a muscle strain at Selhurst Park.

Newcastle hope to have last weekend's two-goal hero Papiss Cisse fit after his recent bout of illness

However, midfielder Mehdi Abeid is suspended after being sent off at Palace, while defender Davide Santon (knee) and midfielders Siem de Jong (thigh) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) are still out.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Dummett, Haidara, Coloccini, Williamson, S Taylor, Tiote, Anita, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, Gouffran, Obertan, Ameobi, Riviere, Cisse, Perez, Armstrong.
