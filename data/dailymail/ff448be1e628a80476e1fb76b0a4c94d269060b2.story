Ferdoush Hasan, 22, is accused of raping the 14-year-old in February, as well as a second charge

Two schoolgirls were raped at a house where vulnerable youngsters were taken advantage of by older men, a court heard.

A 14-year-old victim was held down by Abu Sufian, 21, and Raabsan Khan, 19, while Ferdoush Hasan, 22, raped her last February, it is claimed.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the sex attack was just days after another girl, who was also 14, was raped by Hasan alone.

All three men, from South Shields, deny a joint charge of rape. Hasan denies a second, solo, charge.

Prosecutor Anne Richardson told the court the attacks happened at a house where the trio, who were all students at South Tyneside College, were living.

Miss Richardson told jurors: 'The crown’s case is these defendants took advantage of young girls who were vulnerable, who were drinking alcohol and smoking although underage and who came to the defendants’ house in order to have somewhere to do both of those things.

'No doubt you will take a fairly dim view of that and wonder what on earth young girls like this are doing in a house with men older than them, who speak little English and they had no friendly relations.

'The crown’s case is precisely because these girls were vulnerable and somewhat foolish and naive, the defendants felt they could act in the way the crown alleges.

'Basically, these girls could be used for sex and either they would not say anything for fear of getting into trouble or if they did say anything, the circumstances and background and how they came to be in the house would mean nobody would believe them.'

The court heard the first attack was in early February last year when the alleged victim turned up at the house with friends after drinking a half litre of vodka.

The girl told police 'all of the males were dark skinned, just lying on the beds in that room'.

It is claimed Hasan led the girl to a room in a different part of the house from where everyone had gathered and raped her.

Miss Richardson told the court: 'She was trying to push him off to no avail as her arms were pinned down by his hands.'

The second alleged victim had also gone to the house with friends.

Miss Richardson said: 'Effectively it was just somewhere to sit when it was cold.'

It is claimed the girl, who refused the men’s offer of alcohol but was smoking cigarettes, ended up left alone with the trio during the visit.

Miss Richardson said: 'Two of them grabbed hold of her arms, one on either side, and held her down.'

All three men deny the claims against them.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
