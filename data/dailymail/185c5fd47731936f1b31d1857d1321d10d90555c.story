Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was sent off in their 3-1 defeat at West Ham after racing from his goal to block off Diafra Sakho. Referee Chris Foy called the game back after Sakho had struck the post and showed Fabianski a straight red card. Sportsmail's Graham Poll gives his verdict on the incident at Upton Park. 

Sending off Lukasz Fabianski was arguably the pivotal point of the match.

Fabianski raced from his goal and fouled Diafra Sakho, who was clean through and heading towards goal with an obvious opportunity to score.

To his credit Sakho stumbled on, recovered from the foul and tried to score from an acute angle but hit the post.

Chris Foy called the game back to the point where Sakho had been fouled and dismissed Fabianski.

First impressions were that we were seeing textbook refereeing, with Foy playing advantage: had Sakho scored it seemed that Foy’s vision would have saved the Swansea keeper from the red card as the obvious goal scoring opportunity would not have been denied.

Replays, however, showed Foy had blown his whistle immediately after the collision. Fabianski would have been dismissed even if Sakho had ‘scored’ and that goal wouldn’t have stood.

I would have preferred Foy to have played advantage, but I can’t agree with the TV analysts who questioned the red card.

It was absolutely correct and any handball by Sakho in the lead-up was accidental and only caused by the physical attention of Ashley Williams.

Moments later, Foy missed Kyle Bartley’s clear two-handed shove on the dangerous Andy Carroll.
