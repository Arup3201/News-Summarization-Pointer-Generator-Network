Grandmother Sue White was inconsolable when her beloved cat Miko went missing in August 2002.

After searching high and low for the red Burmese tom, then aged seven, she had finally come to terms with the fact she would never see him again. 

But more than ten years later Mrs White, 56, has finally welcomed her beloved pet back into her home in Pilgrims Hatch, near Brentwood, Essex.

Grandmother Sue White was inconsolable when her beloved at Miko went missing in August 2002. She searched high and low for him, but simply could not find him anywhere

But more than ten years later Mrs White, 56, has finally welcomed her beloved pet back into her home in Pilgrims Hatch, near Brentwood, Essex

A member of the public found him and took him to a vet where he was identified thanks to his microchip. 

And although nobody knows where Miko has spent the last decade - it seems he may not have gone too far - as he was discovered just six miles from his owner's home.

Mother-of-one Mrs White, who had moved to a new house shortly before Miko vanished, said: 'Seeing him again was an absolutely fantastic feeling. I am  walking around with a permanent grin on my face.

'I look at him even now and just can't believe that I have got him back - it still feels quite surreal really.

'It is so amazing. What's happened to me, let's face it, it's a miracle.

'It would be nice to know where he has been all this time - if only cats could talk.'

Brs White who works as Brentwood Borough Council's insurance officer, scoured the area around her home for Miko when he disappeared, putting up missing cat posters and pushing similar leaflets through letterboxes of 200 homes.

She said: 'I was devastated when he went missing - I cried my eyes out and everything. It was horrible - it felt like I had lost a child.

'After 18 months I thought that the chance of ever getting him back was slim but I never stopped thinking of him.

'I used to do a lot of running in the local area and I used to wonder then if I would ever see him.

'You just don't know do you? Cats can travel for miles.'

She said she was stunned to pick up an answer phone message earlier this month from a veterinary practice in Blackmore - six miles from her home - telling her a woman had found Miko and brought him in. 

She said: 'When I heard the message I couldn't believe it.

'As soon as I saw him I knew it was him and so did my son Tristan. He went straight up to my son and nuzzled his head onto his arm.

Although it is not known where intrepid Miko - now 17 - has spent the last decade, he was discovered just six miles away from his home thanks to his electronic microchip

'I couldn't believe it, I was just bouncing up and down. I even texted my ex-husband and said "You are not going to believe this, I have got Miko back".'

She said Miko's coat was in fantastic condition and she was sure somebody had been looking after him. 

She said: 'He is underweight at the moment and he was very weak on his back legs when I got him home - he could barely walk around the house.

'The first time he tried to get up the stairs he really had to drag his back legs but now he is eating he is a changed cat.

'He is jumping up on the bed and he is obviously feeling a lot better in himself.

'I can tell that his sight is going, plus he's got renal failure, although that's now under control with tablets.

'My first Burmese, Shogan, only made it to 11 because he had renal failure quite early on, so in many ways I am surprised to see him alive.

'He always was a loving cat and that hasn't changed despite him being away for ten years.'

Student veterinary nurse Danielle Fowles, 22, was on duty at House and Jackson veterinary practice in Blackmore when a member of the public bought Miko in.

She said: 'We have had cats that have gone missing for a few days or months and one that had gone for a year but we've never had anything as long as this before.'

Dawn Avery, the RSPCA's chief inspector for Essex, said: 'This just goes to show just how important microchips are as one of the only ways of permanently identifying a pet.'
