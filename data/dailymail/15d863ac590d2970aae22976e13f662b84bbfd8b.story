This is the moment a partygoer dressed as Scooby-Doo sparked a 16 man brawl with revellers dressed as zombies during a night out. 

The unnamed man stepped out onto a busy road outside the Mash Tun bar in Brighton, East Sussex, to take on the group of men whilst wearing the all-in-one fancy dress costume.

Frightened onlookers - including some dressed as Cinderella, Lord Nelson and a giant caterpillar - watched as the scrap spilled out on the streets.
