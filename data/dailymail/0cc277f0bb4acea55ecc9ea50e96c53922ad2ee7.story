John Hatfield, 69, died in May last year after suffering a cardiac arrest in hospital when staff failed to give him a blood transfusion 

A 69-year-old man died in his hospital bed after doctors failed to give him a life-saving blood transfusion, despite ordering it five hours earlier.

John Hatfield, from Heworth in York, was admitted to hospital on May 1 last year.

He was quickly diagnosed as suffering a gastrointestinal bleed, a side effect of taking the blood-thinning drug, Warfarin.

An order was placed with York Hospital's blood bank for a transfusion, within one hour of Mr Hatfield's admission to A&E at 4.55pm.

But the decision was taken to delay the procedure, and transfer the 69-year-old to the acute medical ward.

The father-of-two arrived at the ward at 10.25pm, already suffering chest pains and heart palpitations, but an inquest heard he was neither monitored by a nurse, nor visited by a doctor.

Nearly three hours later, after being alone on the ward, the low volume of blood in his body triggered a cardiac arrest.

Dr Hatfield never regained consciousness and died seven days later on May 8, after his life-support machine was switched off.

The inquest heard Dr Hatfield was being monitored for long-term treatment of Atrial Fibrillation, a common condition which causes an irregular heart rhythm and affects around one in 20 adults over the age of 65.

His condition was under regular review and was well controlled by the Warfarin medication. 

The York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust admitted liability.

Today, following the inquest into Dr Hatfield's death on Wednesday, his family called for lessons to be learned to prevent the same mistake being repeated.

His wife Madeline Hatfield, 71, said: 'We simply cannot conceive how we could lose John so suddenly.

'One day he is at home happy, fit and able, the next day on a life support machine.

'To find out that he could have, and should have, easily survived leaves us devastated.

'In our opinion, it is not down to a lack of systems. It is that the systems and protocols were wholesale ignored.

'John was not failed by one member of staff - he was failed repeatedly by everyone who was responsible for his care.

Dr Hatfield, pictured with his wife Madeleine, was suffering a gastronintestinal bleed caused by medication he was taking. Within an hour of being admitted doctors ordered a blood transfusion to replace the blood he had lost. But  eight hours later he suffered a cardiac arrest, after medics failed to carry out the procedure

'I would like to thank the Coroner for taking the time to investigate what happened to John - it has taken our family over a year of meetings, including insisting that the hospital issue a revised Serious Untoward Incident Report to replace what we felt was a flawed one.

'I hope lessons are learned to prevent this happening to others in future.' 

Katie Warner, medical negligence expert at Irwin Mitchell, said Dr Hatfield's family found it very difficult to hear the coroner rule his death was avoidable.

She said: 'The past year has been horrendous for the family and for them to hear that John's death was completely avoidable has left them devastated once again.

'The incident raises a number of issues which the Trust needs to ensure it addresses in terms of observations of patients and training for its staff so that the same thing cannot happen in future.

'The Trust has carried out an internal investigation and made a number of recommendations in respect of treatment to be provided going forward, the family are keen to ensure that these recommendations are implemented.'  

The York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which runs York Hospital, pictured, admitted liability for Dr Hatfield's death and has apologised to his family

A spokesperson for York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We accept the Coroner's findings and the conclusion of this inquest. 

'We are sincerely sorry for the circumstances surrounding Dr Hatfield's death, and have already provided a full apology to his family. 

'An investigation was undertaken by the Trust and, following this, a number of changes have already been made to our processes within acute medicine. 

'As demand for our acute services increases we have an even greater responsibility to ensure that our systems and processes are resilient to these pressures and that they fully support our staff in delivering safer care. 

'We have reviewed the rotas to ensure that they better reflect our capacity and demand, and we have also reviewed staffing including the introduction of Acute Care Practitioners onto the Acute Medical Unit. 

'We have also introduced new measures to enable staff to assess and identify those patients that are most at risk. 

'These actions have been implemented since the outcome of the Trust's investigation following Dr Hatfield's death, and will reduce the risk of another incident of this nature taking place.'
