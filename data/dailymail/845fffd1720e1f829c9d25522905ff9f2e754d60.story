The BBC handed its own staff £369million in severance payments over eight years, the spending watchdog revealed yesterday.

MPs said the massive sum showed an ‘outrageous disregard for licence-fee payers’ money’.

The National Audit Office said the BBC often breached its own guidelines and had ‘put public trust at risk’ by authorising the payouts, including £61million to senior managers.

Some staff were even paid twice, pocketing a payoff after working out their notice period in full.

The average individual payments to senior managers rose steadily to £191,000 last year, demonstrating the BBC had a ‘fat cat mentality’, MPs said.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the damning report revealed a ‘culture of payoffs that simply cannot be justified’.

As director general Tony Hall admitted the BBC had ‘lost its way over payments’, pressure mounted on its governing body, the BBC Trust, to explain why it had failed to ‘get a grip’ despite years of disquiet over payoffs to senior staff.

Lord Hall will appear before the influential Public Accounts Committee of MPs next week alongside BBC Trust chairman Chris Patten and former director general Mark Thompson, who authorised some of the most contentious deals.

The NAO revealed:

The NAO report also accused the BBC of failing to keep proper records to document why individual payoffs were approved as it emerged some deals were simply agreed by divisional directors following verbal discussions.

NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘The BBC has too often breached its own already generous policies on severance payments. Weak governance arrangements have led to payments that exceeded contractual requirements and put public trust at risk.’

In an effort to reduce costs, the BBC has cut its senior management by more than 20 per cent since 2005. But 67 per cent of those who left claimed severance payments. These came under three categories: Redundancy payments, money given in lieu of notice in return for their swift departure, and ‘discretionary’ payments.

Shockingly, the NAO discovered cases of senior managers claiming money ‘in lieu’ despite having served their full notice periods, effectively paying them twice for the same period of work.

One unnamed manager, who earned £300,000, was given a full years’ salary in lieu of notice despite continuing to work for 14 months after agreeing a departure date. The payment was personally approved by Mr Thompson, who also agreed to give the manager a pension ‘augmentation’ of £266,288.

In 2005/6, the average individual severance payment was £128,000. This rose steadily to £191,000 in the last financial year.

Two staff members were offered £425,000 in lieu of notice even though they had already secured jobs with other employers before leaving.

Other managers were given ‘discretionary’ severance payments, the reasons for which were ‘not fully recorded’, the NAO found.

One received £219,000 – £141,000 more than they were entitled to, including £49,000 for ‘training and information technology equipment to improve the individual’s skills and career prospects’.

Another received an ‘ex-gratia’ payment of £17,600, four months extra pay in lieu of notice worth £71,000, plus a redundancy payment of £88,100.

In a separate development, the BBC revealed that Mr Entwistle, who resigned on November 10 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal after 54 days as director general, received a total of £802,000 during his final year with the corporation.

As the Trust set his last day of employment on November 30, he was given an extra three weeks’ salary worth £25,000 on top of a severance payment of £470,300 and a series of generous benefits including legal support and private healthcare.

Criticism: New director general Tony Hall admitted the BBC had 'lost its way' with big money pay-offs for senior staff

The BBC also admitted that Mr 
Entwistle and Mr Thompson had racked up almost £200,000 in ‘legal and 
related costs’ between them for their appearances before the Pollard 
Review into how the BBC handled the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Last
 night Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts 
Committee, said: ‘I expect [the BBC Trust] will say these payments are 
not their responsibility. But they are there to protect the licence fee 
payers’ interest and provide oversight. They should have got a grip on 
it.’

She added: ‘The BBC 
have shown an outrageous disregard for licence fee payers’ money. It 
seems there has been a fat cat mentality in the BBC.’

Mrs Miller said: ‘The NAO has exposed a culture of payoffs that simply cannot be justified.’

Despite
 accepting its processes were ‘not robust enough’, the BBC said it had 
saved more than £35million overall by reducing senior managers.

Lord
 Hall said: ‘I accept in full the conclusions of the NAO report. The 
level of some of these payments was wrong – I said so in my first week 
in the job. I believe the BBC lost its way on payments in recent years. I
 have already said that we will be capping severance payments at 
£150,000 and we have now begun to improve our processes.’

Last
 year 71 per cent of the BBC’s £5billion income was funded by the 
£145.50 licence fee. The rest was made up by selling BBC programmes 
internationally through its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide.

One former BBC executive was so 
shocked that his £376,000 severance payment was not properly authorised 
that yesterday he wrote a cheque to the BBC repaying it.

Roly
 Keating, who was the director of archive content, left last year after 
29 years’ service to become chief executive of the British Library.

Even
 though he was not made redundant, he was offered a full years’ salary 
of £250,000, as well as some £125,000 in lieu of serving his notice 
period. The NAO said the decision to award it was ‘seriously deficient’ 
and found the BBC agreed to pay the money because it believed he would 
not otherwise have accepted his new job, which had a salary of £150,000.

The
 51-year-old, who was previously controller of BBC2 and BBC4, left as 
the corporation was making redundancies and the future of his role was 
uncertain. After being contacted by the NAO, Mr Keating wrote a letter 
to the BBC including a cheque for the entire sum.

Explaining
 his decision to BBC director general Tony Hall, he wrote: ‘You will 
understand that as a matter of principle I would never wish to benefit 
from a payment that could not be demonstrated to have been fully and 
appropriately authorised.

‘This
 week I was concerned to receive from the NAO ... new evidence, of which
 I was not and could not have been aware, concerning the BBC’s internal 
process for approval of the payment to me.

‘This
 evidence has led the NAO to observe that the process in this case was 
“seriously deficient”. I therefore enclose with this letter a cheque 
payable to the BBC, amounting to the full sum I received as severance 
payment after tax was deducted by the BBC at source.’

The BBC declined to comment.
