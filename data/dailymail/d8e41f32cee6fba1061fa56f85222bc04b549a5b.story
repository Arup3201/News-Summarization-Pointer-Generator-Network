An eccentric Chinese billionaire who has become notorious for madcap publicity stunts has done it again, this time taking out a full-page ad in the New York Times to invite 1,000 poor Americans to lunch.

Chen Guangbiao, a recycling magnate best known in the U.S. for his over-the-top business card and a failed attempt to buy the New York Times, created a bilingual ad that appeared in print Monday extending an open invitation to low-income people to dine with him at the high-end Boat House Restaurant in Central Park on June 25.

The generous tycoon also promised to hand out $300 in cash to each participant of his charity event.

Lunch and a show: Chen Guangbiao, a recycling magnate from China, has taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times to invite 1,000 poor Americans to lunch, where he promised to perform We Are the World for his guests

‘I hope they can spend the money on 
occupational training and know there are no religious or ethnic 
boundaries when it comes to charity,’ he told South China Morning Post.

In the ad, the controversial billionaire explained that his goal was to change Americans' negative perception of members of China's elite as 'crazy' and obsessed with material goods.

‘I want to spread the message in the US that there are good philanthropists in China and not all are crazy spenders on luxury goods,’ Chen told the South China Morning Post.

Chen added that his other goal was to set an example for his less-than-scrupulous fellow one-percenters, encouraging them to become involved in philanthropy instead of splurging on luxuries, gambling and prostitution.

During the planned charity luncheon, Chen is expected to entertain his 'destitute' American guests with his rendition of We Are The World performed in English.

So far, more than 250 people have accepted the invitation to lunch.

Chen said he expects to spend $1million on his latest charitable endeavor.

In the New York Times advertisement, Chen
 compared himself to Lei Feng, a much-admired People's Liberation Army 
soldier and devoted communist who became the subject of a propaganda 
campaign after his death in 1962.

The renewable energy magnate made headlines in January when he handed out boastful business cards to reporters covering a press conference with two Chinese burn victims who were brought to New York by Chen to undergo reconstructive surgeries.

The event was overshadowed by Mr Chen’s cards, in which he lavished praise on himself as the 'Most Influential Person of China,' his country’s Moral Leader,' 'Most Well-known and Beloved Chinese Role Model,' and 'China Earthquake Rescue Hero.'

During the same event, he also announced his intentions to 
buy the New York Times for $1billion, something he changed to $3billion 
when he was told that the newspaper is worth $2.5billion - but his bid fell through.

Chen, however, is not ready to give up on his dream. Speaking to South China Morning Post this week, the billionaire expressed interest in buying the Times' opinion section, which he envisions as a bilingual page dedicated to charity and the environment.
