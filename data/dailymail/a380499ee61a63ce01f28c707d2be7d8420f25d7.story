Neglect: A mother who left her ten-month-old baby strapped in his pushchair for 14 hours in a urine-soaked nappy and without a feed has avoided jail

A mother who left her ten-month-old baby strapped in his pushchair for 14 hours in a urine-soaked nappy and without a feed has avoided jail after admitting neglect.

The baby's father contacted social workers after he noticed while changing the child that the little boy had red abrasions on his legs caused by sitting in his own dirty nappy.

The following day, both the boy and the woman's older child were taken away from their mother.

Derby Crown Court heard the woman had not felt up to looking after the children because she felt 'unwell'. She admitted she had only given the children crisps and a drink each during the day.

But she was handed a 12-month community order, with supervision and 100 hours of unpaid work, after pleading guilty to neglecting her children.

The alarm was raised after the infant's father found two 10cm-long dark red abrasions in lines across his legs as well as areas of eczema. 

The injuries are believed to have been caused by 'long contact with urine-soaked nappies',

The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons but who lives in Derby, also pleaded guilty to neglecting her three-year-old child - again by not feeding it during that period.

Sarah Allen, prosecuting, said: 'In interview, she accepted her son would have been in a soiled nappy and had been in the pushchair for over 14 hours and held down. She felt it was the only option because she was feeling unwell.'

Miss Allen said the woman also accepted she had not fed them for that period of time - from 11pm until 1pm the following day - a period in which they had been sitting together in their living room.

Miss Allen said: 'She accepted her son, by that stage, was a crawling, active baby and she accepted he would not have been happy being treated in that way but felt that there was nothing further that could have been done because she was suffering pain.'

Admission: The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons but who lives in Derby, pleaded guilty to neglecting both of her children at Derby Crown Court, pictured above 

Passing a community sentence Judge John Burgess said: 'Being a mother is a great responsibility.

'You are expected, both by the public and your children, to care for them and care for them properly, and you didn't - you failed both of your children.

'You failed to give them food over a significant period of time and you left one of your children strapped in a pushchair without changing his nappy for too long, and he suffered as a result.'

The judge said he accepted that this had not been 'deliberate ill-treatment'.

He added: 'At that particular time, you were an inadequate mother - you weren't able to cope.'

He said she had been unwell but needed to understand that there were millions of mothers who felt unwell but went on to look after their children 'brilliantly'.

The judge believed the main cause for the neglect was the depression she had been suffering at the time.
