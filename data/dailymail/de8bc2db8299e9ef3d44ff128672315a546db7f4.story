Smog blowing across the Pacific towards the United States from China is often caused by the manufacture of goods for export to America, a new study has claimed.

Researchers found pollution choking the American West Coast comes from China's production of mobile phones, televisions and other consumer goods for export.

Dr Steve Davis, from the University of 
California, Irvine said: ‘We've outsourced our manufacturing and much of
 our pollution, but some of it is blowing back across the Pacific to 
haunt us.

Cities like Los Angeles (pictured) received at least an extra day of smog a year from nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide from China's export-dependent factories, a report said

‘Given the complaints about how Chinese pollution is corrupting other countries' air, this paper shows that there may be plenty of blame to go around.’

The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to work out how much pollution reaching the West Coast originates from China.

Los Angeles, for example, experiences at least one extra day of smog that exceeds legal limits because of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emitted by Chinese factories producing goods for export.

Black carbon has been linked to numerous health problems including athsma, emphysema, heart and lung disease and even cancer. It can be problematic because rain doesn't easily wash it out of the atmosphere.

The study also revealed that as much as a quarter of the sulphate pollution on the US West Coast is tied to Chinese exports.

However, China is not responsible for the lion's share of pollution in the U.S. - cars, trucks and refineries pump out far more.

Japan and South Korea have regularly suffered noxious clouds from their neighbour in the last couple of decades as environmental regulations have been sacrificed for economic and industrial growth.

But powerful global winds known as ‘westerlies’ can carry chemicals over the ocean to the U.S in days, particularly during spring, causing dangerous spikes in contaminants.

And dust, ozone and carbon can accumulate in valleys and basins in California and other Western states.

The authors believe the findings could play an important role in the future negotiation of clean air treaties.

China's huge surge in industrial activity in recent years, as well as poor pollution controls, has led to often fierce international debates.

The researchers wrote: ‘International cooperation to reduce transboundary transport of air pollution must confront the question of who is responsible for emissions in one country during production of goods to support consumption in another.’

Dr Davis said: ‘When you buy a product at Wal-Mart, it has to be manufactured somewhere.

‘The product doesn't contain the pollution, but creating it caused the pollution.’

Air quality is of increasing concern to China's stability-obsessed leaders, anxious to douse potential unrest as a more affluent urban population turns against a growth-at-all-costs economic model that has poisoned much of the country's air, water and soil.

Authorities have invested in various projects to fight pollution, but none has worked so far.

In Shanghai the smog has been so severe recently that flights have been diverted, schools closed and authorities left mulling whether to distribute gas masks to the mega-city’s residents.

The population stands at 23million and it’s not been made clear whether every person would receive a mask, but officials are becoming increasingly concerned at pollution levels and may at least give one to people who work outside.

Last year authorities claimed that illegal barbecues were contributing to the air pollution in Beijing and seized and subsequently destroyed 500 of them, according to Shanghai Daily.
