If there is one thing you can guarantee with British weather, it is that you cannot rely on it.

Sure enough, the weekend heatwave came to an abrupt halt as storms erupted across the country.

As if to underline the point, Mother Nature even threw in some spectacular and seldom seen horizontal lightning forks amid the grey, oppressive clouds.

Stunning photographs of the thunderstorms were captured last night and this morning in Cumbria, Devon, Merseyside and on the Isle of Wight.

The Met Office had severe weather 
warnings for rain in place today over most of northern England, from 
Northumberland down to South Yorkshire.

Yesterday,
 Heathrow had Britain’s top temperature of 2014 - 26.3C (79F) - warmer 
than Tenerife at 23C (73F); Crete, 22C (72F); and Athens, 21C (70F).

Rachel Vince of MeteoGroup said: ‘Thunderstorms are due to spread across the country from the West, reaching south-eastern parts by the afternoon.'

The forecaster added: ‘There is a risk of up to 15 (0.6in) to 20mm (0.8in) of rain as the showers pass through.

'So, people who have become used to carrying sunscreen would be advised to carry an umbrella.

‘Temperatures are due to be closer to the average of late teens to early 20s during the rest of the week and into the bank holiday weekend.’

Despite the cooler weather, bookmakers have slashed odds that the highest temperature ever recorded in Britain in May will be broken.

Ladbrokes was offering odds of 5/1 last night that the 32.8C (91F) high set 60 years ago would be beaten this month.

But showers will affect eastern and central parts of England tomorrow, giving some locally heavy or thundery bursts of rain.

west through the day, giving some heavy and thundery spells.

But
 there will be largely dry conditions in the South-East on Friday with 
sunny spells developing, although it will remain showery in the North 
and West.
