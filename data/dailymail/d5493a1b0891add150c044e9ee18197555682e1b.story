National Front parade bugler Allen Boyce, who died recently aged 82, left £28,416 in his will to Ukip. Nigel Farage said the money would be given to charity

Ukip faced a new race row last night over a £28,000 gift from a pensioner branded ‘evil’ by a judge for giving a bomb-making recipe to a man who attacked immigrants’ homes, writes Simon Walters.

Allen Boyce received a two-year suspended jail sentence for handing bomb-making instructions to a British National Party activist who was jailed for a race-hate campaign against Asian families in Eastbourne.

Details of political donations published last week show that Boyce, a National Front parade bugler, who died recently aged 82, left £28,416 in his will to Ukip.

Boyce pleaded guilty at Lewes Crown Court in 2006 to incitement to possess explosives.

He told Terry Collins how to mix two chemicals needed to make a bomb, and gave him a note claiming he knew a hotel where immigrants lived.

Collins did not use the recipe, but carried out a 14-month race-hate campaign against three families.  He was jailed for five years for pelting their homes with stones and a firework tied to a brick.

Judge Anthony Niblett suspended Boyce’s sentence for two years  and placed him under a two-year supervision order.

He told him: ‘Your involvement in criminality  stems from your extreme political views which are abhorrent to all  right-minded people. On mature reflection, you will understand the wrong, indeed the evil, in which you have become involved.’

Last night, Mr Farage reacted quickly to defuse the row and announced the money would be given to charity.

In a statement issued shortly after The Mail on Sunday contacted Ukip over the donation, the party said it was ‘horrified at the provenance of this money’.

It said the cash would now be passed to a charity ‘helping Christians and Yazidis suffering in Kurdistan’.
