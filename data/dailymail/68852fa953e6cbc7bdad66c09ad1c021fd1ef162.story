Sam Burgess has admitted his quest to hurriedly master the mysteries of rugby union is proving harder than he imagined, with the line-out a particular source of confusion.

Bath’s cross-code recruit made his debut in the 15-man game at the end of November and has played in midfield and the back row.

‘I knew it was going to be tough but I didn’t know it was going to be as tough as this,’ he said.

Sam Burgess has his progress halted by Leicester centre Anthony Allen at Welford Road 

Burgess, who featured at outside centre for Bath against the Tigers, is tackled by Owen Williams 

‘But I came for the challenge and I’ve no regrets. 

'There are so many differences, I would say they (codes) are almost opposite.

‘I have enjoyed some parts of scrummaging, not so much the line-outs — being blatantly honest, because I don’t understand them.’

Burgess and his Bath side found the going tough against the Tigers and were beaten 17-8
