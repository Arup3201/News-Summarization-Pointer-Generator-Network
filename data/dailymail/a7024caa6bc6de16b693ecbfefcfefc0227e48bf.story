Faces covered in ash and paint, these are the Hindu holy men who live their lives away from everyday society.

Known as sadhus, they shun all home comforts for a life of asceticism spent inside caves, forests and temples across India and Nepal.

German banker and photographer Mario Gerth decided fulfil a long-held obsession by finding and photographing the religious devotees, known colloquially in India as Godmen.

'I have been obsessed with the sadhus for many years and set off in 2013 to look for them,' said the 38-year-old of Erfurt, Germany.

'In India, I found them in the hidden temples of crowded Delhi and on a bench alongside the holy river Ganga in Varanasi. They were also close to the Himalayan mountains in Nepal.'

Mr Gerth embarked on a two month trip in search of the most intriguing sadhus to photograph in his portable studio. He visited them throughout India, in cities such as Calcutta, Varanasi and Delhi, and also in the Nepalese town of Kathmandu.

'Sadhus leave their home and family, and reject an earthly life, which includes all their worldly attachments,' he said. 'As part of this renunciation, they also leave behind their clothes, food and shelter. Instead, they rely on the generosity of others.

'Sadhus don't lead a normal life like others; they choose to live poorly and only find richness in spirit and humanity.'

Sadhus are people who have chosen to dedicate their lives to achieving religious illumination and liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.

There are four to five million sadhus in India today and they are widely respected for their holiness, while also feared by some who believe they have the power to inflict curses.

They frequently smoke cannabis which, although illegal for everyone else, is said to help them communicate with Shiva, on of the most popular Hindu gods.

Mr Gerth said: 'I felt very excited during my journey. It was very new and thrilling as I was searching for them in hidden temples and down old streets.

'People are impressed by the colourfulness and uniqueness of these men.

'I have even been asked before, 'are they human?', which was one of the strangest reactions!

'I tried to find the ages of all the men I photographed, but I kept getting the same response.

'They all told me they don't care for age.'

Sadhu men usually cover themselves with ash or chalk, and paint their faces in accordance with the god they have devoted themselves to.

The ash represents their death to their worldly life.
