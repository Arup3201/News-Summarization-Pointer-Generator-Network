Well, it’s not often that a humble country road sign gets mentioned on the floor of the House of Commons. But one particular example has been drawn to the attention of no less grand a figure than the Rt Hon William Hague MP.

On the face of it, the story reported in the Mail the other day about a Somerset road sign, which, thanks to mad council bureaucracy, has remained hidden in the undergrowth alongside the A38 for two years, looked as though it could be a candidate for Red Tape Lunacy of the Year.

As the sign’s owner, Somerset County Council, limply explained, it couldn’t send anyone out to restore the sign to its proper position because the council would first have had to consult nearly two dozen ‘statutory consultees’ for permission to do so.

When tackled on the issue by a Somerset MP, Mr Hague, the Leader of the House of Commons, agreed this was plain daft. He told Tessa Munt (Lib Dem MP for Wells), the council’s attitude did seem ‘fairly barmy’.

But the more one looks into this sorry story, it seems Mr Hague didn’t appreciate the half of it. The fact is that the word ‘barmy’ doesn’t begin to do justice to the idiocy of what has been going on in the county in which I happen to live — and which, undoubtedly, is also happening all over Britain.

For a start, the sign — if one could see it where it lies, hidden in the bushes — is one of some importance.

It was originally put up to warn traffic of a potentially dangerous turning from a minor side road into the busy main A38 between Bristol and Taunton.

There had been several serious accidents along this stretch of road, and the purpose of erecting the sign was to alert drivers to the turn-off to two small villages and make sure they watched out for vehicles emerging from the side road into the flow of traffic.

When the sign fell off its metal posts two years ago, it should have been a very simple matter to put it back in place.

As Ms Munt observed after being told of the problem by locals and visiting the site herself: ‘All it needed was for someone to hoick the sign out of the undergrowth where it had fallen off its posts and use four clips to pin it back up.’

But, inevitably, in a country increasingly dragged down by jobsworths and bureaucracy, such common sense was not taken into consideration by the dead hand of officialdom.

The council’s response was that it couldn’t dream of carrying out such a simple task until it had been given the go-ahead by a long list of ‘consultees’ — the various public and private bodies deemed by law to have a potential interest in the matter.

It claims it has to do this under a combination of — you’ve guessed it — ‘health and safety’ legislation, and rules laid down in the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.

But when the council sent Ms Munt a full list of the ‘consultees’, she could scarcely believe her eyes. They included a whole range of major utilities, from Bristol Water and Wessex Water to SSE Power (based 100 miles away in Basingstoke).

There were two separate departments of National Grid: one for electricity, the other for gas. Also included on the list were BT Openreach, Vodafone and Orange; two separate departments of Network Rail; Tata Communications, based in Watford; and Virgin Media, based in Birmingham. What on earth was going on here?

Of course, one can understand the need to consult such bodies whenever it is necessary to dig a hole that might interfere with their pipes or wires.

Indeed, that is precisely what the New Roads and Street Works Act covers — with respect to works requiring the digging of holes more than ‘77 mm’ deep.

But what, for heaven’s sake, could the lifting of a roadside sign out of a Somerset hedgerow have to do with the organisation in charge of our national railway network — let alone mighty international corporations based as far away as Birmingham and Watford?

It seems that the council’s ‘Street Works Department’ took upon itself the task of drawing up its own list of organisations that it thought were necessary to consult.

It then lamely conceded that it did not actually have to consult every single one of those 22 organisations before putting up that road sign again.

‘On average,’ it said, ‘we only have to consult 12 or 14.’

Even so, the hassle involved in contacting all 22 firms was enough for Somerset County Council officials to put the case of the ‘Incredible Vanishing Sign’ firmly at the back of their ‘pending tray’.

In fact, as a Somerset council taxpayer — along with my neighbours — I have long known that our council’s highways department is notorious for its reluctance to keep its road signs in good order.

For years, the main signpost in our little village was allowed to become so rust-covered that its lettering became illegible.

In the end, my son, Alex, who lives in London, took matters into his own hands during a visit and went out with some paint and a brush to make it look good as new again.

The council isn’t always so pathetically slow to act, though. A few years back, the residents of many Somerset villages were amazed to see teams of workmen plastering every conceivable roadside and lane with spanking new 30 mph speed limit signs.

As a result, one village reported it now had 30 signs along just 200 yards of road.

Our own village was decorated with 22 of them, including two on such a sharp zig-zag bend in the centre of the village that not even Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton could have got round it at more than 5 mph.

But when I asked the council how much all this sign-mania was costing — at a time when it had raised our taxes by twice the rate of inflation — they were strangely coy.

I was firmly told by the ‘portfolio holder’ of the ‘Environment and Transport Department’ that we couldn’t be allowed to know how much they were pouring into this scheme as ‘there is a degree of commercial sensitivity with regard to this information’.

In other words, the council is quite happy to take our money, but refuses to tell us how it is spending it.

Since then, it seems little has changed with our local county council’s casual approach to the hard-earned cash they extract from those of us who live here. 

In August, it was revealed that Somerset’s director of children’s services, Peter Lewis, was being paid £318,000 a year for working just a four-day week, making him the highest-paid council official in the country.

He had come to work in Somerset from the North London borough of Haringey, where he had replaced the disgraced Sharon Shoesmith, who was sacked after presiding over the Baby P scandal, only to be awarded £600,000 in compensation.

Last month, we learned that Mr Lewis himself has now been sacked by Somerset County Council, in advance of an Ofsted report giving his department its lowest possible rating — ‘inadequate’ — for the second year running.

Much the same charge might be levelled at the feeble officials of Somerset’s highways department for their hopeless attitude to the maintenance of road signs — an incompetence that is, sadly, so typical of clipboard-carrying municipal jobsworths all over the country.
