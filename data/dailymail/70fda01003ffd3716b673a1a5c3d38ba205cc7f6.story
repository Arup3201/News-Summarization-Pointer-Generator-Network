A conman who defrauded Harrods out of luxury goods worth £245,000 was berated for his expensive tastes by  a judge who asked why  he didn’t just shop at Marks & Spencer.

Philip Buffett used dud cheques to pay for a £216,000 Hublot watch, a second one costing £20,000 and other  luxury items.

Yesterday the serial fraudster wore a red Ralph Lauren polo shirt when he appeared before Judge Simon Oliver who asked him: ‘Why the Ralph Lauren clothing? I’m assuming it’s not the real brand.’

'Fantasist': Serial conman Phillip Buffett was told off by a judge for wearing a red Ralph Lauren polo shirt in the dock as he stood trial for cheating Harrods out of a £216,000 watch

Buffett, 49, confirmed it was genuine, to which the judge replied: ‘Well I’m glad you can afford it. What’s wrong with M&S?’

Judge Oliver said: ‘How you ever thought you could buy a watch worth £216,000 absolutely stuns me. Why anyone would want a watch worth £216,000 also stuns me.’

The judge compared Buffett to the fictional Walter Mitty, who  created a fantasy world to escape his real life.

He went on: ‘You may well think it important to be perceived as important, successful and wealthy. You are neither rich nor successful. You are completely unsuccessful in all that you do.’

Buffett, of Croydon, South London, has served time for 45 previous fraud offences.

But Judge Oliver spared him jail, saying prison would be a waste of taxpayers’ money because it had failed to stop him reoffending.

Giving Buffett a two-year suspended sentence, the judge said: ‘We are trying to stop you reoffending.

‘I will impose a sentence that will appear to be light, but will give you the focus you need.’

Scam: Buffet used a cheque from a closed bank account to fleece the Knightsbridge store out of the £216,000 watch as well as other luxury items worth £28,000

Buffet pawned the expensive Hubolt timepiece for £77,000 (file picture)

In the scam at Harrods last April 
Buffett had used a personal shopper service. Apart from the two Hublot 
watches his purchases included clothing and a camera. He pawned the 
£216,000 watch to get a £77,000 loan which he used to go to the Monaco 
Grand Prix.

He was 
arrested at Gatwick on his return. Buffett had earlier pleaded guilty at
 West London Magistrates’ Court to fraud by false representation to the 
value of £245,000.

Yesterday he was sentenced at Reading Crown Court for the  Harrods fraud as well as for ripping off other companies and individuals under the guise of various firms he had set up while he was banned from doing so.

He bought goods and services he could not pay for, and duped individuals into investing money with him or paying for training courses that never materialised.

Buffett’s previous ruses under the name Mark Castley included duping elite British athletes with the promise of lucrative sponsorship contracts in exchange for ‘membership fees’ of up to £1,000 in the build-up to the 2012 Olympics.
