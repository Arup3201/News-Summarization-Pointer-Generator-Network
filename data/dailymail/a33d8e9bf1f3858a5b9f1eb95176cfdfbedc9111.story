Former Italy manager Giovanni Trapattoni believes under-fire Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is wasting his career.

Balotelli has struggled since moving to Anfield during the summer and has never failed to make the headlines off the pitch.

Trapattoni fears the 24-year-old will one day look back on his career with regret - and has partly blamed the Italian's agent Mino Raiola.

Trapattoni told La Nazione: 'I do not know how Balotelli’s career will pan out.

'But I know that when he hangs up his boots he will realise the many opportunities he has wasted.

'Part of the blame also has to go to Mino Raiola.'

Balotelli is set to return from a groin injury to face Manchester United in the Barclays Premier League clash at Old Trafford on Sunday.

He has so far failed to score in the league, with his two goals for the Reds coming in the Champions League and Capital One Cup.
