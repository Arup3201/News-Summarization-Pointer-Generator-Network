It is a penalty more commonly associated with classroom than court room. But convicted drug dealer Terry Bennett has been told to pay for his crime by writing a 5,000-word essay.

The 32-year-old had been given a suspended prison sentence as well as 240 hours of community service for possessing a kilogram of cannabis with intent to supply.

However, after Judge Julian Lambert heard that a recurring shoulder injury put paid to any physical work, he took the unusual step of ordering Bennett to write a 5,000-word essay on the negative effects of cannabis.

If he fails to submit it by his 
deadline at the beginning of next month, the suspended sentence could be
activated and he would be sent to jail. Bennett, a father of two who 
has no previous convictions, was told to write the essay on the ‘dangers
of drugs’ at Bristol Crown Court.

The former plumber said yesterday: ‘I 
asked the judge if I could write a balanced argument for and against 
cannabis, but he said that since it’s illegal I should only write about 
the bad things.

'I’m just going to do my best to write about certain 
dangers caused by cannabis that people might not know.’

Bennett, who claims jobseeker’s 
allowance, was originally sentenced in October last year after a police 
raid on his home in December 2011 uncovered 996g of cannabis and £2,685 
in cash.

He then missed two court-ordered work 
placements at the British Heart Foundation in Kingswood, Bristol. He had
been given the job of moving heavy furniture, but could not carry out 
the work because of the injury.

Bennett claims the illegality of cannabis is more detrimental to users than the harmful effects of the drug

Bennett has been 
carrying out research and plans to structure his thesis around the 
mental health consequences of smoking cannabis.

He added: ‘I’ve got a 
drugs conviction, so for me to subsequently take on a more serious role 
in society it is imperative that I prove to everyone that I’m clean and 
steering clear of cannabis, purely because it is illegal.’

Bennett, who lives with his mother in 
the village of Cold Ashton, near Bristol, admitted the charges but was 
unable to do the unpaid work because of a shoulder injury he suffered 
during a snowboarding holiday six years ago.

As well as the essay, which has to be 
handed in to his probation office, Judge Lambert gave Bennett a 
four-month curfew order between 8pm until 6am and is currently wearing 
an electronic tag.

He also voluntarily provides samples 
to be tested for drugs, so social services will allow him access to his 
sons, who live with their mothers.

Bennett said: ‘Hopefully the essay 
should be quite good, but it’s been ages since I last wrote an essay. I 
have already done a bit of research. I’ve always loved writing.’

Bennett has drawn up five bullet points outlining his theory upon which he will base his dissertation:1 - Cannabis changes your mentality, and cause psychotic episodes.2 - The stigma of being associated with cannabis can damage your social standing.3
- It's illegal and the money generated is not taxable, meaning it costs
the Government rather than being a potential source of revenue.4 - People are 'ripped off' as unscrupulous dealers up their profit by mixing the drugs with sand and glass.5 - When consumed in certain ways, most notably being smoked with tobacco, cannabis can cause cancer, especially mouth cancers.
