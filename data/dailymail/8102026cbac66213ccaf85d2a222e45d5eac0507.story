An outback town is recovering after a wild storm which pummeled local properties with torrential rain and giant hailstones the size of shotputs.

The storm hit Chinchilla, in the Darling Downs region of West Queensland, on Saturday afternoon, leaving residents' cars and backyards checkered with hailstones up to 12 centimetres in diameter.

While no locals were injured, residents reported extensive damage to the region, which received over 75 millimetres of rain in two hours.

'We are ok,' said Chinchilla residents Melissa and Peter Matthews, who recorded footage of the giant hailing falling at their property. 

'Not so much the house or the surrounds. Broken window, trees down, holes in roof, flooding and scared children,' they told the Courier Mail. 

Western Downs Mayor Ray Brown said that the clean-up effort would be significant, and that the local community would pull together to aid the region's recovery.

'The best spot from it is that nobody was injured but certainly a lot of damage to vehicles and property,' Cr Brown said.

'At least three council crews, our SES crews have all been involved and even in the towns of Dalby and Jandowae are also cleaning up,' reported The ABC.

Chinchilla resident Marina Baker said that cars all around when she had parked at the local sports field had their windows smashed. 

'We had the back window smashed in [and after] about 30 seconds of moving one came through and landed in the back seat, ' she said.

'The kids were on the floor screaming. We had my sister and husband in the front and they [were] trying to get the kids away from the glass.'

A video shot of hail landing in the local field shows the huge hailstones dropping from the sky onto the grass and bouncing with the force of their weight.

Shocked residents shelter inside near the field, with many recording the astounding sight.

Despite 1,300 homes in Chinchilla lost power from the storm and more than 3000 experienced power supply issues, Cr Brown said that the 'much needed' rain was a welcome break from the drought the region is experiencing.

Terry O'Leary, a watermelon farmer and Angus cattle breeder from the region uploaded pictures of the impact of the storm, including the damage to his crops and the family car.

Mr O'Leary said that the 'nasty' storm dropped 'softball size hail' on his yard, and flattened some of the crops on his farmland, though some were left untouched by the storm. 

After the worse of the storm was over, the farmer reported that 'grape size' hailstones continued to drop on the region.
