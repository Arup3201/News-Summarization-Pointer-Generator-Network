Whether it's frivolous and fun or a serious news story, if people around the world are talking about about a topic, it will have a hashtag.

From the First Lady Michelle Obama endorsing a political campaign surrounding the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria, or celebrities tipping buckets of iced-water over their heads to raise money for charity, the topics that have had us chatting away on social media in 2014 have been far-reaching. 

Add to those Kim Kardashian's #BreakTheInternet picture of her oiled derriere, Miley Cyrus joining the #FreeTheNipple campaign, and Solange Knowles and Jay Z's #Elevatorgate, and it's varied subjects that have gauged our interest.

Here's what got us campaigning, posting, tweeting, donating (and tittering) in 2014.

The #BringBackOurGirls campaign was aimed to raise awareness of the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls by Islamic extremist group Boko Haram in Nigeria

#BringBackOurGirls

You know when Michelle Obama endorses a hashtag, the world will stop and take notice. And that's exactly what happened when she posted a picture of herself holding a sign with these poignant words. 

The campaign was aimed to raise awareness of the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls by Islamic extremist group Boko Haram in Nigeria. In April, the terrified teenagers were abducted in their dorms and and forced on to trucks at gunpoint.

Following apathy from the Nigerian government, the #BringBackOurGirls campaign was started by former Nigerian government minister Oby Ezekwesili. 

As well as the First Lady, Prime Minister David Cameron and celebrities from Salma Hayek to Cara Delevingne and Leona Lewis joined the campaign. Sadly, eight months on, there's still no sign of the students.

 #IceBucketChallenge

Millions of people helped raise nearly £100million for amyotrophic laterel slerosis (ALS) by urging friends and followers to donate to the charity while having a bucket of ice cold water chucked over their heads.

After the likes of David Beckham, Bill Gates and Rita Ora uploaded videos of themselves getting the icy treatment, the world followed suit.

Luckily, the campaign took off in August, and became a welcome cooling technique for celebrities worldwide during their summer holidays.

#HerNameWasReeva

Domestic violence activists used this hashtag to highlight the issue of domestic violence during the trial of Oscar Pistorius, who was jailed for five years for culpable homicide after shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkampf on Valentine's Day 2013.

The Twitter campaign highlighted the prevalence of domestic violence around the globe.

In South Africa, a woman is killed by domestic violence every eight hours while in the UK an incident of domestic violence is reported to the police every minute.

The Olympian has since been sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter.

#NoMakeUpSelfies  

The 'no make up selfies' took the internet by storm in March and are thought to have raised more than £8million for Cancer Research UK and other cancer charities.

Bare-faced celebrities including Cheryl Cole, Holly Willoughby, Amy Willerton and Jemima Khan helped send the trend viral.

Cancer research did not initiate the campaign, but asked users to add a donation request and text code to their posts after becoming aware of the #NoMakeUpSelfies trend.

At the time, Cancer Research UK's head of social media, Aaron Eccles, said: 'We're over the moon. When we do a social media campaign we want to engage as many people as possible, and this has taken off like crazy.'

The trend was kicked off in the UK by Fiona Cunningham, 18, who encouraged people to donate cash along with their selfies after actress Kim Novak kicked off the craze when she appeared bare-faced at the Oscars.

Fiona set up a Facebook page from her bedroom in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and encouraged people to post their selfies.

#Elevatorgate 

There's nothing that gets the world tweeting like a great celebrity scandal - and Beyonce and Jay Z gave the world a gift in the form a family bust-up.

Leaked CCTV footage showed Solange Knowles attacking Jay Z in  a hotel lift in New York City in May with sister Beyonce standing by her side. 

The internet was, of course, aflutter with theories about the fall-out posted under the hashtag #elevatorgate.

The big question was whether it was the end of the music couple's six-year marriage. But seven months on, it seems the power couple are still going strong.

#HeForShe

Launched by Emma Watson at the UN headquarters in New York in September, #HeForShe reminded the world that women's rights was a human issue, not just a feminist one. 

The Harry Potter actress revealed the sexism she has experienced throughout her life, saying it started at the age of eight when she was branded 'bossy' for wanting to direct school plays.

'At 15 my girlfriends started dropping out of their sports teams because they didn't want to appear "muscly" ... at 18 my male friends were unable to express their feelings,' she said in her speech to kick off the campaign.

The UN Women HeForShe campaign aims to get 100,000 men and boys involved in the fight to achieve gender equality.

#BreakTheInternet

When Kim Kardashian flashed her well-oiled derriere on the front of Paper magazine in November along with the cheeky slogan 'Break the Internet', it almost had the desired affect. 

But what the star may not have been prepared for were the slew of spoofs that followed. 

The audacity of the attention-seeking shoot, which also included fully naked photos inside the magazine, inspired people worldwide to take create their own  versions.

Who knew one bottom could create such a global ripple?

#FreeTheNipple 

Free The Nipple started in July as a campaign against Instagram's censorship of female nipples.

The crux of the free nipple message? Why are women not allowed to be topless while men are able to removes their shirts freely? 

The campaign may not have pulled in celebrity activists of the Angelina Jolie caliber, but luckily there's always a star waiting for a chance to flash  for a good cause.

In this case, it was Miley Cyrus who so willingly obliged last week, giving the campaign a new lease of life.
