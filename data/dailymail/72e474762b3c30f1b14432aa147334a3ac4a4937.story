Authorities in Virginia are warning parents to be on the lookout for a deadly designer drug after three teenage girls were hospitalized last week for ingesting the LSD-like substance.

Officers were called to a residence in Lansdowne on April 14, during Virginia's Spring Break, where three girls between 13 and 18 were acting erratically.

When they arrived at the residence one of the girls started yelling and kicking police officers. All three were transported to the hopital and have since been released.

Scary stuff: Authorities in Loudon County, Virginia are warning parents to be on the lookout for a designer-drug called 25i which is sweeping local high schools

Authorities believe the three girls took a drug called 25i, which is also referred to as Nbomb or Smiles.

The
 drug was first noticed in the area around 2012, and in 2013 was 
classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, making it one of the 
most dangerous drugs with a high risk of dependence and abuse.

'25i
 can be dangerous, even at small dosages,' said Loudoun County Sheriff 
Mike Chapman in a statement. 'This drug can cause violent behavior, 
disorientation, seizures and death.'

Varied forms: Like LSD, 25i comes in blotted paper form but can also be ingested in powder form or injected

The
 drug is usually sprayed onto blotter paper, giving it the appearance of
 LSD. It can also be ingested in powder form or injected.

Users
 can experience hallucinations and euphoria while taking the drug, but 
it comes with the serious risks of causing confusion, nausea, seizures, 
and even death. 

'You
 try this drug and you are most likely going to end up extremely sick, 
disoriented, unsteady,' Lt Tony Matos of the FairFax County Organized 
Crime and Narcotics division told NBC Washington.
 'Some people get so irrational they strip their clothes off and run 
naked down the street. Let's cut to the chase. The ultimate result of 
this is death.'

The drug has been linked to the deaths of at least 19 Americans between the ages of 15 and 29 from March 2012 to August 2013.

Perhaps most scary is the fact that the drug can be obtained online, where it ranges in price from $5-$10 a dose. 

Victim: 15-year-old Montana Brown of Fresno, Texas (pictured) died last December after taking the drug. Altogether, 19 Americans between the ages of 15 and 29 have died after using the drug from March 2012 to August 2013
