It was billed as 'All Back To Ours' - a closing ceremony that owed its theme to the Glasgow tradition of extending a good night out at someone's house after closing time.

Well, you know you've had a good night out when you end up getting Kylie Minogue back to your flat.

She probably wouldn't get the luxury of singing seven interrupted songs in a row at an after-hours Glasgow tenement party but she was afforded that privilege at Hampden, Scotland's most iconic sporting venue, as the city celebrated a memorable 11-day sporting festival and passed the Commonwealth Games baton over to the 2018 hosts, the Gold Coast in Kylie's native Australia.

In doing so, Scotland's biggest city 
closed its Glasgow 2014 experience on a typically inclusive and outgoing
 nature as the city basked in the glory of what Commonwealth Games 
Federation chief executive Mike Hooper had earlier termed the 'standout 
Games in the movement's history'.

Okay, he might say that to all his 
party hosts but he will surely find agreement among a sizeable chunk of 
the thousands of athletes and the people who bought more than 1.2million
 tickets to the sporting action, as well as millions more television 
viewers.

Scottish sport has never witnessed anything like these Games
 and the bulk of the Hampden crowd were not just celebrating the 
successful staging of the Games but a Team Scotland performance that 
shattered all records, provided stories that touched the heart and 
success that prompted tears of joy among athletes and spectators alike.

Glasgow
 2014 organisers had consistently promised an athlete-centred Games and 
the stars of the show were involved right from the start, bursting out 
of tents to the strains of Lulu, who even showed signs of rediscovering 
her Glasgow accent for the occasion.

Thankfully the earlier torrential rain had subsided, or many might have been tempted to remain under cover.

The
 sporting stars remained at the heart of the action, but the ceremony 
continued with a musical thank-you to the thousands of volunteers - the 
so-called Clyde-siders - and city workers whose work behind the scenes 
allowed the Games to be such a success.

Deacon Blue's crowd-pleaser 
Dignity - a song about a council worker who realises his dream of owning
 a boat - providing a fitting accompaniment as dozens of road workers, 
lollipop women, firefighters, paramedics and the like walked out under a
 banner with the age-old slogan 'Let Glasgow Flourish'.The speeches 
saw CGF chairman Prince Imran declare the event 'in every aspect the 
best Games ever', the resultant cheer dwarfed only by his praise for 
Team Scotland's performance.

After the Games were declared over and the Gold Coast gave its glimpse of what to expect in four years, it was over to Kylie.

Everyone's
 favourite former Neighbours star, complete with a headdress that would 
have seen her struggle to get past the bouncers in most Glasgow 
nightclubs, began a set that formed the backdrop to what was described 
as a Glasgow love story.

It moved through stages such as 'the chase' and 'the smooch', which came after the ultimate romantic gesture seen on
 Sauchiehall Street on a Saturday night - men throwing away their bags 
of chips to form a physical alliance with their respective partners.

Athletes
 from around the Commonwealth nations joined in and looked on, some no 
doubt more than a touch bemused, as hundreds of performers acted out 
routines ranging from ceilidh dances to the Slosh, a type of line dance 
strongly favoured by drunk aunties at Scottish weddings.

About 1,000 
people recreated the scene of adolescent innocence from cult 1981 
Scottish comedy Gregory's Girl where two young would-be-lovers lie on 
their backs and dance to the sky.

And the party ended just like any 
other late-night Glasgow gathering - with lashings of nostalgia and 
emotion - as folk singer Dougie MacLean performed Caledonia, which 
details an exiled Scot's homesick longing for his homeland.

Auld Lang
 Syne finished off the night as Glasgow bade farewell to some of the 
best times in its history - already a memory but one that will never be 
forgotten by anyone who was lucky enough to be involved.
