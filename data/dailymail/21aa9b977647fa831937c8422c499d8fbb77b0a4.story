Scam: Richard Lowery stole £56,000 from his great grandmother - who brought him up after he was abandoned by his parents

A 'son' who robbed the great-grandmother who brought him up of her £56,000 life savings has been jailed for 18 months.

Richard Lowery, 24, was abandoned by his parents at the age of four and given a roof over his head by Brenda Lowery, 91.

He repaid her kindness by systematically dipping into her bank account over a seven-year period for living expenses and even to pay £575 in court fines, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

His great-grandmother even wrote a letter to the court asking for leniency and hoping that her 24-year-old great-grandson would not be jailed.

But Judge Michael Murphy told Lowery: 'I can understand her views because to her you must be like a son. She stepped up to the mark to care for you when you needed it and has been caring for you but there are some situations which transcend the wishes of victims.

'The courts have a duty to the public to mark the repugnance society feels at such conduct. This was a breach of a high degree of trust. It was a despicable course of conduct and it was exploitation not borne of desperation but borne out of sheer greed.'

Only last week the same judge gave Jayne Godsmark, 41, an eight-month suspended jail term for stealing £6,000 from her ailing 98-year-old grandmother's life savings.

Louise Gallagher, prosecuting, said Lowery, who was responsible for his great-grandmother's financial affairs, stole the cash from an account she had with the HSBC for 40 years.

She loaned him her bank card and he was the only one who knew her PIN number and used it at cash machines to withdraw money directly from the account or simply wrote out cheques payable to himself.

His thieving came to light after his great-grandmother took out an equity release policy on her home with insurance company Aviva and Lowery attempted to obtain £30,000 in three tranches over four months in 2011.

The company called in the police and the discrepancies were discovered. Ironically, Lowery used to collect his great-grandmother's pension for her without taking any of it.

When interviewed by police, Lowery said he became 'addicted' to taking the money and did not realise just how much he had stolen.

Lowery, of Beauchief, Sheffield admitted theft of £56,427 from December, 2005 to May, 2012.

Vanessa Saxton, for Lowery, said she needed her great-grandson's help with managing her finances. He apologised for his behaviour but had not told anyone, even his own family, why he did it.

'His attitude has been one of putting his head in the sand, he is a very quiet individual,' said Miss Saxton.

He had made frequent small cash withdrawals over a long period of time and was astonished when confronted with the total.

'Until now he seems to have led a perfectly respectable life and cared for his great-grandmother all his life,' said Miss Saxton.

He still lived with Mrs Lowery but no longer had access to her bank account.

Judge Murphy told Lowery he had used the account as a cash dispenser 'to dip into whenever you wanted.'

In sentencing he had taken into account Lowery's guilty plea, his previous good character and the views of his great-grandmother which helped reduce the sentence he handed down.

A proceeds of crime hearing is expected to take place later in the year to reimburse Mrs Lowery for her losses.
