A force spokesman said: 'Following an extensive trawl of CCTV cameras in the area detectives have identified the Peaky Blinder lookalike as a suspect.'

The suspect is mixed-race and was wearing a flat cap, a dark double-breasted jacket and baggy trousers.

He was spotted walking in Birmingham city centre at around the time of the attack which happened just after midnight on Saturday, 27 September.

Detective Constable Guy Whitfield said that even though the CCTV images were grainy, the description of the suspect was 'so unusual' police felt someone would be able to recognise him

Detective Constable Guy Whitfield, from Birmingham's Violent Crime investigation team, said: 'The CCTV footage is very grainy and we appreciate this is not of the best quality but we felt that the description was so unusual that someone would be able to recognise the man and come forward with a name.

'We are still unsure of the motive behind the attack but what we do believe is that this was completely unprovoked.

'Officers have been speaking to local businesses and making enquiries but as yet the man remains unidentified and we are now appealing for anyone who can supply a name to call me or one of the team.'

The real Peaky Blinders, some of whom are pictured here, were a terrifying Victorian street gang who ruled the industrialised areas of Birmingham through the 1880s, 1890s, and early 1900s

The gang members earned their nickname by sewing razor blades into the peaks of the caps before headbutting their victims - often causing them to lose their eyes in vicious street fights

Their tale has been told in popular BBC2 drama 'Peaky Blinders' - starring Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy and Sam Neill - which has just finished its second series.
