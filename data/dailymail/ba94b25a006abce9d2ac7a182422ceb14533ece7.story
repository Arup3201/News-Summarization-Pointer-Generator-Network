The new Scotland opened this Test match in lively fashion but the old, frail Scotland returned to shoot themselves in the foot and fall victim to a late Italian resurgence in a third straight RBS Six Nations defeat.

Having come into the match with two promising performances, the Scots were looking for a big performance and a comprehensive win against an Italian team that had been competitive but well beaten in the final quarter of both of their games against Ireland and England.

This was where the picture for both teams turned. Scotland started brightly with a penalty from Greig Laidlaw and interception try by Mark Bennett inside the first seven minutes, Laidlaw’s conversion handing the hosts into a 10-0 lead.

However, Italy responded within minutes, revealing the potency of a well-crafted lineout drive which finished with most of the Italian team driving lock Josh Furno over the Scottish line. Laidlaw came back with a penalty but then Italy did the same from the restart to keep Italy hanging on at 13-8 down after the first quarter.

The scrums were a major blight on this match and Irish referee George Clancy never got to grips with them, one factor in styming Scotland’s attack. He scolded both front rows at one stage for a “terrible attitude” as successive scrums ended in penalties, twice against Scotland for ‘early engage’, and seemed to give up in the second half. The lineouts were not much better, and ultimately the Italians used two – one at the end of each half – to turn one area of dominance into the match-winning points.

If Bennett’s try had some luck, the Italians’ was bizarrely fortunate, Haimona’s penalty coming back off a post and bouncing above Stuart Hogg for 6ft 2in winger Giovanbattista Venditti to grasp and crash down by the post under a welter of tackles. The ball was lost from sight and Clancy asked for the TMO to investigate whether a try had been scored.

English TMO Graham Hughes deemed the ball had indeed been touched down by Venditti, in one movement, and while controversial – and provoking fury from Scottish players and support – further replays showed that the winger had shown great skill in rolling the ball from behind his back to the ground with the help of the post protector before Tim Swinson got his hand under it. Haimona converted the try and again Scotland were reined back in, leaving the score 16-15 to the hosts at half-time.

The second half opened with more scrappy fare and Haimona was replaced by the former Scotland under-20 cap Tommy Allan, having failed to shake off a leg injury, but Allan missed a chance to put the Italians ahead, striking a 35-metre kick from in front of the posts just wide of the right upright.

The Scots gradually began to rebuild the momentum generated on the first half and Hogg was almost sprung, but he was in front of Sean Lamont when receiving the final pass 20 metres out.

Laidlaw rewarded a good period of Scottish attack in the visitors’ 22, with a penalty, stretching the lead to four points, with 15 minutes remaining, but the continuing lineout and scrum nightmare took the Italians into the last ten minutes firmly pressing the home 22 and with chants of ‘Italia, Italia’ ringing out.

The Scottish pack stood firm and almighty roar greeted Clancy’s whistle and decision of a collapsed scrum by Italy, but Horne, hobbling with an injury, critically missed touch with the penalty, and Italy seized their chance.

A lineout was brought down and lock Ben Toolis yellow carded and when the pack drove to the Scots line and went down, Clancy deemed Scotland at fault, awarding a penalty try, and showed Hamish Watson a yellow card - a rare ignominy for two debutants - as Allan converted to put the seal on a dramatic 22-19 win and revenge for Scotland’s smash-and-grab in Rome last year.
