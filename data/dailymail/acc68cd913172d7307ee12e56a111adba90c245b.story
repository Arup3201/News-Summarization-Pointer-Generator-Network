Highly perfumed, these colourful cocktails are made with exotic ingredients usually found in fragrances. 

Carefully composed of items such as mandarin oil, bitter orange, vanilla and even Siberian pine needle extract, the flavours and scents in these drinks were created to reflect the  fragrances of L'Atelier de Givenchy collection.

The sweet-smelling concoctions were created by Cafe Royal's mixologist Tiziano Tasso and are available at The Green Bar from 1 February to 31 March.

The flavours and scents in the seven drinks were created to reflect the L'Atelier de Givenchy fragrances 

The Bois Martial cocktail is made with Jamaican rum, pineapple and sage leaves

Oud Flamboyant with Japanese whisky and mandarin juice.

Chypre Caresse: Gin, jasmine, lemon citrus and the subtle, yet rich, notes of honey.

Ylang Austral: Rum, sour apple sherbet, orange Curacao and mandarin oils, to add balance and depth.

Neroli Orginel:  Cognac, combined with vanilla, lemon and essential oils from bitter orange.

Cuir Blanc - Siberian pine needle extract, to give the palate a woody and fresh taste.

Bois Martial: Jamaican rum, pineapple and sage leaves.

Ambre Tigre: Rye American vodka, Dutch honey whisky and English amber beer.

Oud Flamboyant: Japanese whisky and mandarin juice. 

Each £13 drink has a distinct colour and taste that mirrors the key perfume notes of the corresponding scent.

The inspiration behind the cocktails comes from combining couture and fragrance with flavour, which gives each cocktail a 'distinct colour and unique personality and taste, reflecting the key perfume notes which are uniqueu, universal and distinguished'.

Cocktails include the Ylang Austral with an unusual flavour combination of rum, sour apple sherbet, orange Curacao and mandarin oils; the Cuir Blanc, a Martini-style cocktail made using Siberian pine needle extract to give a 'woody and fresh taste,' and the 'ultra-structured' Bois Martial with Jamaican rum, pineapple and sage leaves. 

Commenting on the partnership, General Manager of Hotel Cafe Royal Anthony Lee said; 'We are delighted to have joined forces with Parfums Givenchy to create this exclusive collection of cocktails, celebrating the seven fragrances in the Atelier de Givenchy.

'I highly recommend coming to taste one in our Green Bar during February and March'. 

This isn't the first time a cocktail has been paired with perfumes.

Last year, The Ritz-Carlton hotel in Berlin launched the world's first sensory bar combining cocktails with exclusive fragrances and aromas.
