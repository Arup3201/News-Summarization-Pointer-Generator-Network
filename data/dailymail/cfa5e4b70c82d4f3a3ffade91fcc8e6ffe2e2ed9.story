Disturbed: Stephen Farrow, 48, left a chilling handwritten note threatening to kill Christians at a house which he burgled just weeks before stabbing a vicar to death, a court has heard

A drifter left a chilling handwritten note threatening to kill Christians at a house which he burgled just weeks before stabbing a vicar to death, a court has heard.

Stephen Farrow, 48, staked the letter to a table with two knives after burgling a house just weeks before he killed Reverend John Suddards, 59.

Written in shaky red pen, it read: 'Be thankful you did not come back or we would have killed you Christian scum. I f****** hate God.'

Farrow later stabbed Rev Suddards to death at his vicarage in Thornbury, Gloucestershire, before carefully positioning pornography, condoms and party streamers around his body.

Farrow admits the manslaughter of 
Rev Suddards on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to a mental
condition, which prosecutors reject.

But
he denies the earlier murder of Betty Yates, 77, at her remote home in 
Bewdley, Worcestershire, by battering her with her walking stick and repeatedly 
stabbing her.

Yesterday, the double murder trial at Bristol Crown Court heard how Margaret Pinder, who owned Vine Cottage close to Rev Suddards' home, found the note pinned to her kitchen table.

She and her husband Alan returned from a festive holiday on January 2 this year to find their home ransacked by Farrow, who has admitted the raid.

A further two knives - one with an eight inch blade and the other a ten inch - had been stolen from their property.

In a statement, Mrs Pinder said: 'On top of the table was a hand written note pinned to the table with two kitchen knives.

'I then realised that two others were missing.

'The note said "it is a good job you didn't come back Christian scum. I fucking hate God".

'The hand writing was in a red pen from a pot in the kitchen and looked shaky as if to disguise it.

'The reference to religion confused me because neither Alan or I are churchgoers or have any items in the house that are overtly religious.

'We did have a magazine in the toilet which had the headline "Is God Green?". It was an ecological magazine.'

Mrs Pinder said the burglar had made himself at home, leaving half eaten food and cups of tea in the kitchen.

Two half eaten containers of ice cream - which had been opened with a knife - were also left on the kitchen surface.

She added: 'I felt very threatened by the note that was left. I am very worried about walking outside alone at night.

'We have increased the security and had an alarm fitted.'

Yesterday the court heard how Farrow told the victim of an earlier knife burglary: 'I've killed people before'.

The jury heard how Farrow previously attacked an elderly woman with a knife as she was alone at her home in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, in 1994.

Edward Burgess, prosecuting, read a statement given by the victim Stella Crow - who died aged 85 in 2003 - after Farrow broke into her home on August 22.

Farrow later admitted a charge of aggravated burglary for the attack, which took place in Ms Crow's house where she let rooms to lodgers.

Her statement read: 'He kept asking for money then he asked for jewellery. I told him I had none.'He put the knife on the side. I grabbed it. I told him to leave.

'A struggle took place. The man grabbed me by the throat then he used two hands to get the knife from me.

'He then struck me to my face. As I hit the floor I hit my left eye.

'I tried to kick him but he was too tall. He then let me stand up.

'He said if anyone came in he would kill me and the dogs.

'He said "I have killed people before". This time he was holding the knife above my head in a stabbing stance.'

She said she recognised Farrow as he had previously stolen one of her tenant's possessions from his room after asking for a place to stay.

Ms Crow, who lost two teeth in the attack, described Farrow as white, 6 ft 4 and with 'grey or green staring eyes'.

The court also heard statements from police forensic experts who found footprints and DNA evidence linking Farrow to the burglary.

Rev Suddards was stabbed to death inside the vicarage between February 12 and 15 this year.

Farrow, of no fixed abode, was arrested at an address in Folkestone, Kent, at 4.20am on February 19 after a nationwide appeal for his whereabouts.

He denies murdering Betty Yates in January and accepts killing Reverend John Suddards in February - but denies murdering him.

His trial, expected to last for six weeks, continues.
