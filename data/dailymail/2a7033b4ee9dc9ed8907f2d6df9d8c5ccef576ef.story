Ed Miliband was facing turmoil last night after one of his own  MPs condemned his strategy as ‘suicidal’ and a Labour parliamentary candidate was secretly recorded describing his leadership as ‘dodgy’ and ‘incoherent’.

The outbreak of open dissent – just days before crunch elections – followed a week of mounting panic in the party after the Conservatives recorded a lead in the polls for the first time in more than two years.

Labour MPs have been privately briefing this weekend that if Mr Miliband does not ‘show progress’ in Thursday’s local and European election results, they would collectively break ranks to call for ‘a mass shake-up’ of strategy and personnel.

The scale of the nervousness is revealed in a public broadside today from Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who urges Mr Miliband to abandon his strategy of ‘relying on the Government’s unpopularity’ to win next year’s General Election.  

‘Sooner or later the Tories were always going to get their act together.... Now we need to up our game,’ Mr Danczuk says in an article, right, for today’s Mail on Sunday.

The MP writes that ‘continually reciting a mantra of misery is not the answer’, and warns that the party will not win by relying on a ‘core vote  and a few disgruntled Liberals’ – which he describes devastatingly as ‘a suicidal strategy’.

His remarks are a thinly veiled attack on the plan advocated by elections supremo Douglas Alexander to aim for a modest 35 per cent share of the vote at next year’s poll – and hope that the in-built advantage the party receives from the electoral system delivers a Commons majority.  

Mr Danczuk concludes: ‘Time is running out and if we don’t have a strong European and local elections next week then things need to change... more of the same won’t cut it.’

Mr Danczuk’s fears were echoed by Tristan Osborne, a Labour parliamentary candidate in Chatham and Aylesford – one of the party’s key target seats – who was recorded making  critical remarks about Mr Miliband’s election strategy.

‘The machine is not functioning in any capacity,’ Mr Osborne was taped saying at a £100-a-ticket Labour fundraising event held on Tuesday. ‘We need to be appealing to the aspirational Southern voter. The current strategy doesn’t... indicate that we are winning over that type of support.’  

Mr Osborne – highlighting a party election poster which falsely and embarrassingly suggested the Tories had put VAT on food, which is exempt – revealed the dismay felt by Labour candidates who see their chance of entering the Commons at the next Election fading.

‘I’m fearful,’ he said, citing a ‘dodgy campaign’ and ‘no coherent messaging’, before adding: ‘The economy is picking up. That reinforces the narrative that they (the Conservatives) are doing well, and there’s absolutely sod all anyone can do about that.’ The party’s meltdown started after two polls at the start of the week gave the Tories a rare lead over Labour, causing pundits to slash the chances of Labour securing a majority (see below).

It coincided with the arrival in the UK of David Axelrod, the former Barack Obama election guru, who has been hired by Mr Miliband on a reported £250,000 contract to turn his fortunes around.The strategist – known as ‘The Axe’ – gave a short speech to the Shadow Cabinet, held meetings with key frontbenchers including Harriet Harman and addressed party staff about campaigning techniques.

But sources say Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was the only senior Labour frontbencher not to ask a question when Mr Axelrod was introduced  to the Shadow Cabinet. Mr Balls  has been engaged in a thinly veiled turf war with Mr Alexander, who is credited with persuading the US elections guru to work for Labour.

One source said: ‘Everybody asked Axelrod a question – everybody, that is, except Ed Balls. It wasn’t hard to read between the lines.’

But The Mail on Sunday also understands there was irritation that Mr Axelrod – who is not expected to spend much time in the UK – was only able to take questions for just over half an hour.

One source said: ‘In the middle  of a vital election campaign, the Shadow Cabinet were all ordered  to be in London to meet this great figure. And yet when Ed introduced him, he said, “David can only be here for about 40 minutes.” That did not go down well.’

Witnesses said the quietly spoken Mr Axelrod – ‘more James Stewart than John Wayne’ – then spoke for under five minutes. ‘He said there were differences between the US  and British politics but one thing  was common – a sense of alienation among voters from the political process. It was all very nice but I’m not sure what it added to the sum of human knowledge,’ said the source.

One senior Labour MP warned: ‘We are staying quiet until Thursday’s results, which have to show progress. If we lose seats then we are not on course to win the Election, and we will need to speak out. Miliband and Balls are becoming as dysfunctional as Blair and Brown, and Balls and Alexander loathe each other. We need a mass shake up’.

Last night, Tory Cabinet Minister Eric Pickles came to the Labour leader’s support, saying he was genuinely an ‘Ed Miliband fan’ and insisting Labour had picked the right man. Communities Secretary Mr Pickles also warned his party not to underestimate Mr Miliband.

‘He is the authentic voice of Labour and we have made a series of mistakes collectively because we have always underestimated him,’ he said.

Tristan Osborne refused to  comment last night.
