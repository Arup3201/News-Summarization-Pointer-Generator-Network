A much-loved police dog killed in a stand-off with a cornered gunman in New York today will be honored in a memorial service for paying the 'ultimate sacrifice for his companions'.

Ape, a Czech German Shepherd, was killed by Kurt Myers when officers stormed the abandoned bar he was holed up in in Herkimer County today at 8am. Myers was shot and killed in return fire.

Police say the 64-year-old randomly shot four people dead at a barber shop and car wash across the towns of Mohawk and Herkimer yesterday

Killed: Ape, a Czech German Shepherd, was shot dead today in the stand-off in upstate New York

The 2-year-old dog was on his second FBI mission and will be buried back at the police academy in Quantico, Virginia, where he completed his four month special training on February 25.

Special Agent Ann Todd said: 'Ape was doing what he was trained to do and made the ultimate sacrifice for his team. His actions were heroic and prevented his teammates from being seriously wounded or killed.'

'K-9s are a tremendous asset in tactical operations and enhance the safety of law enforcement personnel who routinely confront complex and high-risk threats'.

'He will be missed by his FBI family.'

Dogs are often used in stand off situations to help officers locate suspects whose whereabouts are unknown.

Dedicated officers tried to keep Ape alive with CPR after he was shot in the chest following the morning shoot-out.

Facebook memorial pages have been set up in dedication to the Tactical K-9 by people moved by the sacrifice of the animal.

His name will be added to a memorial wall at the police training facility after the service.

State Police Superintendent Joseph D’Amico said the dogs are used because they are 'much more acute than people in locating suspects, especially in certain types of premises. I think that's what happened here, and as unfortunate as it is that the K-9 lost his life, it could have easily been an officer'.

Police had been engaged in a 15-hour stand-off with Myers before the shooting.

Suspect: Police say Kurt Myers, 64, fatally shot four people yesterday

Myers' killing rampage had started early Wednesday after he allegedly ignited a fire in his apartment in the nearby village of Mohawk, which is about 80 miles northeast of Albany.

Myers then drove to John's Barber Shop around the corner and used a shotgun to kill two customers, who were identified as Harry Montgomery, 68, and Michael Ransear, 57, a retired corrections officer.

The shop's owner, John Seymour, and another customer, Dan Haslauer, were listed in critical condition at a Utica hospital.

Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said the gunman then drove to 
Gaffy's Fast Lube in nearby Herkimer and used the shotgun to kill Thomas
 Stefka, an employee, and Michael Renshaw, a customer who was a 23-year 
veteran of the state Department of Corrections.

John Seymour, the barber shop owner, told his sister, Mary Hornett, that the attack came out of nowhere.

‘He just said that the guys were in the 
barbershop and this guy comes in and he says, 'Hi John, do you remember 
me?' and my brother said, 'Yes, Kurt, how are you?' and then he just 
started shooting,’ Hornett said.

Hornett said her brother, who was 
hospitalized in critical condition, was doing well after being shot in 
the left hand and right hip.

‘My brother couldn't think of any reason why he would do such a thing,’ 
she said of Myers, a former customer who hadn't been in the shop for a 
couple of years.

Cuomo called the shooting spree ‘truly an inexplicable situation.’

‘There's no apparent motive to the best of our knowledge at this time to provoke these attacks,’ he said.

D'Amico said police had not had any communication with Myers, whose only known police record was a 1973 drunken-driving arrest.

Neighbors said they barely knew Myers, who rarely spoke, and left every morning in his red Jeep.

Traci Randall said the only time she 
remembers speaking to her next-door neighbor was when he yelled at her 
son because he thought he had shot an air pellet at his Jeep.

‘He was a great guy, a really nice person. This is horrific. We really couldn't believe it,’ she said.

‘He would walk by himself. He was kind of a loner. No wife,’ she said.

Michele Mlinar, a bartender at 
Cangee's Bar and Grille in Herkimer, said Myers frequently went in and 
had a bottle or two of Coors Light and left without speaking to anyone. 
She said he was always alone and she didn't even know his name until 
police released his mug shot on Wednesday. Cangee's owner Candy Rellin called Myers ‘just an odd little man.’

The two villages are about 65 miles 
east of Syracuse, on opposite sides of the Mohawk River in a region 
known as the Mohawk Valley.

James Baron, the mayor of Mohawk 
described his village as close-knit and friendly, ‘the kind of place 
where you'd say, "Oh, it would never happen here."'

Harry Montgomery Sr. of Mohawk was among the victims who were shot and killed at John’s Barber Shop.

Montgomery, 68, was visiting the shop for a haircut, according to his son.

'My sister was
 at the bank, cashing a check when she heard all the commotion,' 
Montgomery told the Observer-Dispatch. 'She came out to see what was 
going on and found out it was Dad who got shot.'
