Comedian Freddie Starr has been re-bailed until October by police investigating alleged 'historic' sexual offences

Comedian Freddie Starr faced new agony yesterday after he was re-bailed until October by police investigating alleged ‘historic’ sexual offences.

The 70-year-old was first arrested by detectives from Operation Yewtree - the Scotland Yard inquiry set up in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal - in November of last year.

He was re-arrested in April when further allegations against him emerged. He was due to answer police bail this week, but has instead been re-bailed until October.

The entertainer, who lives in Warwickshire, has consistently denied any wrongdoing and had hoped he would be cleared this week.

A number of well-placed sources believe the claim against him is flimsy and ultimately he will face no further action.

Operation Yewtree is being run in three strands - one involving claims against Savile, one against Savile and others, and the third allegations involving others.

Starr’s arrest in November concerned allegations involving Savile and others, while the April re-arrest was over claims with no link to the late, shamed television presenter.

Last week Jim Davidson was told he would face no further action seven months after he was arrested over allegations he sexually assaulted ten women.

The 59-year-old comedian was arrested in January and again in March as part of Operation Yewtree.

But the Crown Prosecution Service said the women’s allegations were not strong enough for there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction.

Three people have so far been charged under Operation Yewtree.

Earlier this month ex Radio One DJ Dave Lee Travis was charged with 12 sexual offences, some dating back to the 1970s.

PR guru Max Clifford 70 is accused of indecently assaulting seven women and girls

PR supremo Max Clifford 70, who is accused of indecently assaulting seven women and girls, and former BBC driver David Smith, 67, who is accused of sexually abusing a young boy, will face trial next year.

Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris, 83, and disgraced glam rocker Gary Glitter, 69, are among those still on police bail - waiting to hear whether they will be prosecuted.

They all deny the claims.

A decision on whether Harris will be charged is expected shortly.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
