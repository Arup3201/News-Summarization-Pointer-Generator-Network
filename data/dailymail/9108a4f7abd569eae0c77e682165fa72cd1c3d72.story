America's largest reservoir will fall this week to its lowest level since it was filled nearly 80 years ago, according to federal water managers.

Lake Mead, Las Vegasâ€™ main water source located on the Colorado River, will fall to about 1,080 feet above sea level due to crippling drought.

But US Bureau of Reclamation regional chief Terry Fulp said the record low won't trigger any water restrictions for 40 million people across America's southwest.

Lake Mead, a man made lake filled in 1937 and formed by the Hoover Dam, has been losing water for over a decade and is currently at 
about 40 percent capacity.

'We continue to closely monitor the projections of declining lake levels and are working with stakeholders throughout the Lower Basin to keep as much water in Lake Mead as we can through various storage and conservation efforts,' Fulp said in a statement.

The lake on Tuesday was just under 1,082 
feet above sea level, and the reservoir was about 39 percent full, said 
Rose Davis, a bureau spokeswoman in Boulder City, Nevada.

Previously, the lowest levels were about 1,082 feet in November 2010, and 1,083 feet in April 1956 during another sustained 
drought.

The dropping level since the reservoir was last full in 1998, at just under 1,296 feet above sea level, has left as much as 130 feet of distinctive white mineral 'bathtub ring' on hard rock surfaces surrounding the lake.

Davis said the bureau expects a slight increase in water level to about 1,083 feet by January 1, 2015.

Lake Mead National Recreation Area, 30
 miles east of Las Vegas, is among the federal government's top tourist 
attractions. It drew some 6.3 million visitors in 2013, about the same 
number as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

Boaters
 and swimmers have largely ignored the dropping water levels in a place 
where splashing in cold fresh water on 100-plus-degree summer days is a 
treat. But they've also dealt with marina closures in recent years. 
Visitors who used to feed scraps to carp from restaurant deck tables may
 now need to trek hundreds of yards with sandwiches and beach blankets 
to enjoy a waterside lunch.

'We projected this was coming,' Davis said. 'We are basically where we expected to be, given the dry winters in 2012 and 2013.'

Lake Mead today stores about 10.2 million acre-feet of water and is managed in conjunction with Lake Powell, the reservoir farther up the Colorado River near the Utah-Arizona state line.

Davis said Lake Powell was at 52 percent capacity, holding about 12.7 million acre-feet of water.

Water officials say an acre-foot is about enough water to supply an average Nevada household for a year.

Federal and state water officials have negotiated plans for a shortage declaration triggering delivery cuts to Nevada and Arizona if annual projections for the Lake Mead water level drop below a 1,075 foot elevation. That projection is based on data being compiled by the Bureau of Reclamation.

Davis said the 1,075-foot trigger point is not expected this year or next. But last year, after back-to-back driest years in a century, federal water managers gave Arizona and Nevada a 50-50 chance of having water deliveries cut in 2016.
