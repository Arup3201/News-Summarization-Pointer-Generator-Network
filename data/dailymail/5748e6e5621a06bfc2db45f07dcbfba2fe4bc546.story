This time last year Lisa Riley was getting dressed up in sequins and practising her fox trot as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing. Now she's swapped the glitzy outfits for a stylish and sophisticated look as she models the new Autumn/Winter collection for Evans.

The High Street store said the size 18 actress was the perfect choice to showcase their latest designs of dresses, separates and partywear because she's 'a true advocate of a positive body image.'

They added: 'She also proves that you shouldn't shy away from bodycon just because you are curvy.'

Lisa models her favourite items in the range: A flattering lace dress, left, and a biker jacket which is the most expensive item in the A/W collection at £65

Lisa, 37, said she loved getting dressed up in the clothes to strike a pose for the brand and said a purple lace skater dress was her favourite item in the collection.

She said: 'As I am always getting asked what I'm wearing, it has been brilliant to show off my style credentials and prove that fashion shouldn't have size limitations.'

Lisa also proved that size is no obstacle to grace and flexibility as she impressed on the dance floor on last year's Strictly. Since then, she's stayed true to the show's slogan 'keep dancing' by starring in judge Craig Revel Horwood's show Strictly Confidential that toured the country over the summer.

Now the TV presenter has turned her hand to modelling saying she couldn't turn down Evans when they asked her as the store has always been a 'firm favourite' of hers.   

Got the season covered: The collection includes work and casual wear as well as party pieces

Evans specialise in clothes for sizes 14-32 and the new collection includes flattering fitted dresses with three-quarter length sleeves, oriental print blouses and chic and cosy jumpers.

Lisa was also a fan of a stud detail biker jacket and glitter ankle boots.

Evans said all their footwear was 'designed with comfort in mind' using flexible soles and wide fittings.

The range will go on sale in stores and online this September with prices ranging from £12 for black leggings to £65 for the biker jacket.
