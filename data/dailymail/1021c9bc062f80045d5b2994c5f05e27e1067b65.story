The British teenager who ran away with a Turkish barman revealed last night how she had to sleep rough in a field without food for two days - and said: ‘I thought I would die’.

Faye Jones, 16, of Cramlington, Northumberland, went missing for four days after fleeing from her mother with Murat Can Ertani, 22, while on holiday at the Turkish holiday resort of Marmaris.

But after being found on Monday she told in an interview how Can got her to sell a gold ring she had received from her mother Rhonda, 39, as a 16th birthday present, so they could survive on the run.

Faye also revealed how Can tried to 
make her cycle 600 miles to Adana, a Turkish city on the border with 
Syria, forced her to hitchhike after dark and got her to walk through a 
forest full of mosquitoes.

She told The Sun yesterday: ‘I thought I was 
going to die at one point. I was exhausted, I hadn’t eaten. I don’t want
to see him again. It’s over. I’m sorry to my mam for what I put her 
through.

‘I realise I was being selfish. I 
wanted to ring her to say I was safe, but I was too ashamed to get in 
touch. I was hoping to get found. We kissed, we held hands, but it went 
no further.’

Can was released by police earlier 
this week after Faye refused to press kidnap charges against him. He had
been arrested on suspicion of abduction after police found the pair 
trying to hitchhike.

Search: More than 30 Turkish police officers were said to have been on the case and the family put missing person posters up around the resort

In a tearful reunion with her mother, the 
teenager had claimed she ran away because she was ‘frightened’ of Can, 
who has a child with another young British girl.

The mother of Murat Can Ertani has disowned him and admitted
she wished he were dead.

Mirac Sengezer, 43, who works in advertising, said yesterday
that she felt ‘very bad’ about the situation and was ‘sorry’ that her son had run
away with Faye Jones.

She told the Daily Mirror: ‘Here we have laws and you have
to go by the laws. If my son really did this, he has brought shame and upset on
us and he deserves to die. I wish he was dead.’

Ms Sengezer added that she thought Faye’s mother Rhonda
should not have allowed the couple to be together.

She said: ‘I am trying to understand why she
let her 16-year-old daughter be with my son. As a mother I cannot understand it.’

The two wept before hugging each other
when they were reunited at the police station in the town of Mugla.

‘Why did you do it Faye? Why?’ Mrs Jones asked her daughter. ‘Do you 
love him?’

While sobbing, she replied: ‘No I don’t love him. I was just frightened of what he might do.’

Faye had scratches and insect bites 
over her legs from having crossed two mountains before she was found.

She was treated for sunburn and minor injuries in hospital and then 
interviewed by police.

Faye arrived in Marmaris on June 27 
with her mother to visit her grandmother Jackie Armstrong, 68, who lives
and works in the resort.

The teenager had met Can while on holiday last
year. She had secretly kept in touch through
Facebook and Skype. The pair met again last week, but on one occasion 
he was aggressive to Faye in front of her mother.

Mrs Jones then banned her daughter 
from seeing the waiter after he erupted into a jealous rage and ordered 
Faye to stop dancing while on a night out.

Pattern: Alanah Longshaw with her son. She revealed Murat Can Ertani groomed her via Facebook, told her he loved her and persuaded her to leave her mother and move in with him in Turkey

Faye, who completed her GCSEs this 
summer, later packed a suitcase and was seen driving away from the 
apartment with Ertani while her mother gave chase.

One of Faye’s friends, who had 
reportedly been slapped by Can during the earlier incident, said the 
teenager only ran away with him because he had threatened to harm her 
and her mother.

The pair were briefly spotted in the 
town’s bazaar shortly afterwards on Thursday, but they dumped Faye’s 
suitcase containing money and her passport while escaping.

After four days of torment, Mrs Jones sunk to her knees crying when the police rang her to say her daughter had been found.
