The White House is struggling to assert President Barack Obama's relevance as drowning Democrats have had to decide between defending him and throwing him under their campaign buses.

Several liberals in tough re-election fights have opted, Peter-like, to deny him three times before Election Day's cock can crow. 

Mark Begich, Alaska's embattled Senate Democrat, put his finger on what his party's bigger names are grappling with, saying that while he voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012,'that's irrelevant. The president's not relevant. He's gone in two years.'

First choice, Bubba: Former President Bill Clinton (center) became part of Kentucky Senate hopeful Alison Grimes' selfie on Tuesday, before telling Kentuckians not to give Republican Mitch McConnell 6 more years in the Senate because of anger toward a president with 2-years left in office

'I've disagreed plenty with Obama, but that’s not an issue to me,' Begich said. 'It’s where we are today, it’s the next six years. He’s gone in two.'

'Whoever’s the next U.S. senator will be dealing with a new president. That’s the bottom line.'

The White House fired back on Thursday after that report appeared in The Washington Examiner. 

'I didn’t see those comments,' Obama's press secretary Josh Earnest said improbably.

'The vast majority of Americans would agree that that whoever the sitting President of the United States happens to be is relevant in a lot of important ways.'

Even the party's chairwoman, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is putting space between herself and the Oval Office. She needs to win re-election, too. 

Asked on the MNSBC 'Morning Joe' program if voters who support Democratic congressional candidates on Nov. 4 will be symbolically backing the president, Wasserman Schultz insisted he's is not an Election Day issue.

'Barack Obama was on the ballot in 2012 and 2008,' she said. 

True enough, but his policies are on the ballot. Just ask Obama himself.

The president ensured his relevance, at least in the cutthroat Senate campaigns that will determine who runs Congress in 2015 and 2016, by insisting during an Oct. 2 speech that his 'policies are on the ballot' in November, 'every single one of them.'

David Axelrod, Obama's longtime political savant, told NBC's program 'Meet the Press' days later that inserting that language 'was a mistake.'

'I wouldn't put that line there,' Axelrod said.

With that one rhetorical flourish near the end of an otherwise uninspiring economic speech at Northwestern University, the president made the elections, in part, about himself.

And with Obama's approval numbers hovering just below 40 per cent – and dipping to a disastrous 33 per cent in Begich's Alaska – that turn doesn't bode well for his party.

Stalking horse: Obama said in a radio ad that Michelle Nunn (right), a Georgia politician who won't be seen with him, will nonetheless vote for his policies if she wins a Senate seat

Already four different Democratic Senate candidates have dodged the question of whether they voted for the president, including Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

In the tense North Carolina Senate race, Democrat Kay Hagan found herself between the proverbial rock and hard place on Tuesday, when an MSNBC reporter asked her if Obama is 'a strong leader' in the face of crisis.

'We were late to the table' on Ebola, Hagan conceded.

'So you don’t think he showed strong leadership?' came the reporter's follow-up. 

'Certainly,' she conceded, 'there are issues that I certainly think – um, no.'

Earnest, at the White House, demurred on Thursday with stronger resolve than Hagan showed in defending Obama.

Hagan has a history of delivering results for North Carolinians, Earnest told reporters, 'even if it means criticizing the leader or her own party. I think that's a testament to her leadership.'

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday that Obama is 'relevant' because he's president – but didn't offer specific policy reasons

As Obama's coattails have shrunk in his second term, surrogates like former President Bill Clinton have given speeches and worked fundraising rooms on his behalf in states where a lost Senate race could contribute to a Congress controlled exclusively by the GOP. 

'Make sure nobody casts a protest vote,' Clinton told a crowd of Kentuckians on Wednesday. 

'Whoever heard of somebody giving a six-year job for a two-year protest?'

Obama tried this week to clamp off the flow of blood to the Democratic Party's more resentful wing by telling MSNBC host Al Sharpton that his electorally vulnerable detractors are all 'folks who vote with me.'

'They have supported my agenda in Congress,' he said, even if they're keeping their distance when voters are within earshot.

That message resonated in Georgia this week when a radio ad started running on urban-contemporary radio stations in majority-black counties.

'If Michelle Nunn wins, that means that Democrats keep control of the Senate, and that means that we can keep on doing some good work,' Obama is heard saying in the 30-second spot.

Nunn is squaring off against Republican David Perdue in a contest for an open Senate seat.

Obama hasn't appeared with her on the campaign trail.
