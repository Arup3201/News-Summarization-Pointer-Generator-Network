Featherstone have signed Samoa forward Reni Maitua on a two-year deal from the Canterbury Bulldogs.

The 32-year-old has 174 NRL appearances to his name and his signature is a real statement of intent from Rovers ahead of a season which sees promotion to the Super League back on the agenda.

'This is a massive signing for Featherstone Rovers,' said coach Andy Hay.

'His playing record speaks for itself and he brings a wealth of experience to our dressing room.'

Three-cap international Maitua started out with Canterbury and then had spells with Cronulla and Parramatta before going back to the Bulldogs.

He made 13 appearances for them in 2014.
