A teacher who told police he thought it was legal to view child abuse images in private has been thrown out of the profession.

Mark Edwards-Jones, 59, was found with more than 200 images of child pornography after his internet service provider noticed he was downloading indecent images and alerted police.

When officers swooped on his home in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, the Year Ten teacher - who has now been banned from ever teaching again - tried to delete some of the pictures as police searched his home, a tribunal heard this week.

Teaching industry body the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard that Edwards-Jones later told officers that he thought it was within the law for a teacher to view child abuse images in their own home.

Edwards-Jones, a science teacher at the Park Education Support Centre in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, taught Year 10 pupils aged between 14 and 15.

Luke Graham, panel chairman, said the nature of Edwards-Jones' crime was 'fundamentally incompatible with being a teacher'.

'Mr Edwards-Jones has shown no remorse, nor recognised the wider impact of his actions on children', Mr Graham said.

'Despite the training he received in relation to child protection, he still continued to possess and access indecent images of children.

'He also failed to recognise that his actions were wrong and, at various times, has sought to justify that his actions were legitimate'. 

Officers had swooped on the man's home in Hertfordshire in September 2010, where 218 child porn images were discovered across three of his computers.

The following year, Edwards-Jones pleaded guilty to possessing an indecent photograph or pseudo photograph of a child at Wood Green Crown Court in north London.

He was handed a supervision requirement for two years, told to participate in a sex offenders’ treatment programme, and put on the sex offenders' register for five years.

This week, the tribunal barred the teacher from ever practising again.

Mr Graham said: 'We are satisfied that Mr Edwards-Jones' actions were deliberate, as evidenced by the number of images, the number of computers and his attempts to delete images.

'We conclude that a prohibition order is necessary in order to protect members of the public, and in particular children, to maintain public confidence in the teaching profession and to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct.

'We consider, therefore, a prohibition order is proportionate'.

Edwards-Jones, who did not attend the hearing in Coventry,now cannot teach at any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England and cannot reapply for registration.

He has 28 days to appeal the decision.
