Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is concerned about the fitness of his goalkeeper Hugo Lloris who needed stitches in a knee wound following a hefty collision with team-mate Kyle Walker in the second minute on Saturday's win over Leicester.

Spurs medical staff will make checks on the wound this week but the injury will rule him out of France's games against Brazil and Denmark and possibly Spurs' next league game against Burnley on April 5.

Though the keeper's wife, Marine Lloris, eased fears that the keeper will face long spell on the sidelines by tweeting: 'Hugo needs to rest bit but he will be back really soon.'

Pochettino said after the game: 'He's in hospital with the doctor and we wait for news. 

'He got a big cut on the tendon of his knee. We hope it's nothing big.'
