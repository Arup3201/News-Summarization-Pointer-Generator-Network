Rory McIlroy survived the first big test of his nerve at Hoylake in spectacular style to set up the most glorious chance he will surely ever have to win his first Open Championship.

There will be plenty more challenges to overcome on the back nine on Sunday, but the way McIlroy swatted away the challenge of Rickie Fowler with an eagle at the par-five 16th hole and then another at the 18th was the stuff of the greatest major champions.

McIlroy will now take a six-shot lead into the final round of The Open after carding 68 on a day when The Open was played for the first time in its 143-year history with a two-tee start. The bold decision was made by the R&A following forecasts for Saturday afternoon of electrical storms, but these never materialised and, bizarrely, everything was wrapped up before 4pm.

Pumped: Rory McIlroy is now the heavy favourite to win his first Open Championship after a stellar round

Fans' favourite: Rory McIlroy makes his way to the 18th before finishing with a magnificent eagle three

McIlroy’s round was not quite as good 
overall as his opening pair of 66s but the Northern Irishman did 
everything in the manner of a man who knows he is playing a class above 
the rest of the field.

His 
nearest challenger is Fowler. For so long on Saturday it looked like it 
would be Rory vs Rickie going toe-to-toe in the final round at Hoylake. 
But now McIlroy has a cushion that should allow him to relax and seal 
his third major title.

Fowler got within two shots of McIlroy’s lead after a 
blockbuster front nine of 32 strokes and the pair were tied at 12 under on the 12th and 13th holes. McIlroy pulled clear at the 16th when he 
smashed a stunning two-iron to 20 feet and drained the putt. Fowler, 
meanwhile, bogeyed the same hole and the lead was suddenly five shots.

Weather warning: Electrical storms were forecast for Saturday afternoon but they never materialised

McIlroy
 dropped a shot on the next but no matter. Another stupendous long iron 
pitched on top the front of the green and rolled to within 10 feet of 
the pin for another eagle chance. There was no mistake with the putt. 
Even in his pomp, Tiger Woods could not have done it better.

Fowler
 shot 68 to sit one stroke clear of Sergio Garcia and Dustin Johnson. 
But surely a third leg of a career grand slam in majors will follow for 
McIlroy.

Woods, meanwhile, 
continued to struggle on his return to major competition following 
serious back surgery in March. The 14-time major champion shot a 73 to 
sit three over and in 58th place.

If McIlroy continues to play in such 
imperious fashion, the biggest threat to Jack Nicklaus’s major record 
might come from someone other than Woods.

Hats off: Could Sergio Garcia mount a challenge on the final day at Hoylake?
