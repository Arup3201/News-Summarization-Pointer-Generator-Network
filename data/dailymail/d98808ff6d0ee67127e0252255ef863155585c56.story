A 40-year-old woman and her three-year-old daughter were lucky to have survived a high speed crash in which their car flipped more than six times.

The entire heart-stopping incident, which occurred at about 11:45am in Maroochydore at the Sunshine Coast on Thursday, was captured on the dash camera of a tow truck driven by local Murray Lowns.

'When I looked back I saw the silver car in the middle of the road and there was just cars going everywhere and trucks going everywhere,' Mr Lowns told Channel Seven News.

Footage from the dash-cam shows a silver Holden Astra, that was driving behind the truck, changing lanes while driving at a high speed on the Sunshine Motorway.

The vehicle then appears to entirely miss its mark, driving straight across the lane it was aiming for and over a barrier before picking up speed and entering an exit lane.

It then swerved back into oncoming traffic where it began to roll, flipping at least six times.

Miraculously, despite at least three other vehicles driving behind the horrific scene, no other cars were hit by the out-of control vehicle.

The 40-year-old woman, who had to be cut out of the car wreckage, was taken to hospital in a stable condition with no serious injuries, Channel Seven reported. 

'Her daughter luckily was fine, she actually walked away with not a scratch on her,' Mr Lowns said.

Kim Gray, from Queensland Fire and Rescue, told Channel Seven it was amazing that a second vehicle was not involved in the accident. 

'[It is] really good that they had their seatbelts on, their safety harnesses in place. The child seeing the parent being extracted is obviously a traumatic event as well,' he said.

A Queensland police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that officers were investigating how the car lost control and confirmed that a three-year-old child had not been injured in the incident.
