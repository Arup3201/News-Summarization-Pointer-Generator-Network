Two chain restaurants have joined the growing list of businesses across the U.S. that will no longer allow firearms in their establishments -- even as states like Georgia and Arizona have passed laws that give gun owners the right to carry firearms in bars and restaurants that serve alcohol.

Chili's and Sonic join Chipotle and several other local establishments that will no longer allow guns in their restaurants, despite state laws that allow guns in bars and restaurants.

In most states that have passed legislation allowing people to carry firearms in restaurants and bars, the business owners still have the option to set policies prohibiting guns on their property.

Sonic: Sonic asks patrons to leave guns in their vehicles if they dine at one of their outdoor patios

'We recognize that the open carry of firearms creates an uncomfortable 
atmosphere and is not permitted under many local liquor laws,' Ashley 
Johnson, a spokeswoman for Chili's' parent company, Brinker 
International, said in an email to the Huffington Post. 'So, we kindly ask that guests refrain 
from openly carrying firearms into our restaurants and we will continue 
to follow state and local laws on this issue.'

A spokesperson for Sonic told the website that it will follow all laws allowing restaurant patrons to store guns in their vehicles if they choose to dine at one of their restaurants - which are primarily drive-up patios - but they don't want weapons outside of the vehicles.

'Weâ€™re asking that customers refrain from bringing guns onto our patios 
or into our indoor dining areas,' Patrick Lenow, Sonic's vice 
president of public relations, told the website.

Johnson suggested that the two chains coordinated to set a common gun policy, saying 'When issues like this happen, we always talk to others in the industry to get their perspective.'

No guns: Texas gun advocates demonstrated at a Chili's last month by bringing assault rifles to dinner

Both restaurants, however, said that the recent shooting spree near the University of California at Santa Barbara campus had nothing to do with the timing of their announcements.

Last week, video surfaced of members of the gun-advocacy group Open Carry Texas bringing assault rifles to a San Antonio Chili's restaurant. The gun-toting advocates were asked to leave for upsetting other patrons - and the incident prompted Chili's corporate office to review its policy on firearms in its restaurants.

Shortly after the video appeared on Youtube, the group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America - which advocates for stricter gun regulations - called on businesses to not allow firearms on their premises or face boycotts.

Chipotle was the first of the restaurant chains to re-examine its gun policies and ban guns in its restaurants.

'We know moms make the majority of spending decisions for our families,' Shannon Watts, the founder of Mom's Demand Action, said. 'When we collectively wield our economic power we can make a 
real difference.'

CJ Grisham, the president of Open Carry Texas, told HuffPost last week that his group does not agree with the decision but will comply with the restaurant's requests.

'Our comment is 
that business owners have a right to make their employees and customers 
defenseless to the criminal element,' Grisham said. 'We have always 
honored private property rights. Gun free zones have only proven that 
criminals don't read signs.'
