Amazon customers can now pick up their parcels from Post Office branches as part of a huge expansion of its ‘click and collect’ service.

The deal will offer a lifeline to some of Britain’s struggling rural Post Offices as it brings more customers through the doors.

From today, those who buy from the US giant can collect their orders from 10,500 Post Office branches out of 11,500. Only the smallest branches, such as those in sheds, schools and pubs, will be exempt.

Amazon customers can now pick up their parcels from Post Office branches as part of a huge expansion of its ‘click and collect’ service. It means there are now more than 16,000 Amazon ‘pick-up points’ in the UK

It means there are now more than 16,000 Amazon ‘pick-up points’ in the UK.

Customers can already collect their parcels from Amazon lockers, including at train stations, and hundreds of shops through a scheme called Collect+.

Last month, Amazon also launched its ‘Pass my Parcel’ service which introduced same-day collection from 500 convenience stores and newsagents.

But the retailer has now signed a deal with Local Collect – a collaboration between Royal Mail and the Post Office – offering a more traditional collection point for customers.

Ninety-nine per cent of the population lives within three miles of a Post Office branch, making it a convenient pick-up point for millions of shoppers.

Under the deal, Royal Mail will deliver all the parcels to the Post Office itself – a coup for the firm which only last week complained that it faced tough competition from Amazon’s delivery service.

Royal Mail estimates that Amazon’s recently-launched 12-hour delivery service could singlehandedly dent its business by as much as two per cent in the short term.

Christopher North, of Amazon, said yesterday: ‘Offering the collection of packages from Post Offices is another great way of providing our customers with the highest levels of convenience.’

Hundreds of Post Offices have closed in the last decade, although numbers have stabilised in recent years as they have tried to modernise, including offering longer opening hours and opening on Sundays.

The new collaboration will increase footfall in Post Offices, encouraging customers to buy other products and services during their visit.

Last year, sub-postmasters claimed some post offices faced an ‘extremely uncertain future’, warning many branches and retail outlets were under serious threat.

But yesterday, George Thomson, general secretary of The National Federation of SubPostmasters, said: ‘This is good news for the UK’s subpostmasters, in what are difficult times for many trying to maintain their Post Office service.

‘This massive extension to Amazon’s PickUp programme will give customers easy and convenient access for collecting parcels, and even more reasons to visit their local post office.’

George Martin of the Post Office said: ‘It is terrific news. It will offer anther service for existing customers and attract a whole new group of customers into the Post Office.’

Only the Post Office’s smallest branches, such as those in sheds, schools and pubs, will be exempt from the service.

Prior to the new agreement, customers could return Amazon items through the Post Office but not collect them from there.

Dave Ward, of the Communication Workers Union, said: ‘The Post Office has undergone major transformation over the past two years losing nearly 20 per cent of its network but with innovations such as this, it shows that the post office network is still very relevant for today’s communities.

‘Post office workers offer a professional and reliable service and the sooner the Post Office realises this and stops selling them off, the better.’
