West Brom are continuing talks with Rosenborg right-back Cristian Gamboa about a move to The Hawthorns.

Billy Jones left for Sunderland on a free transfer and so West Brom need to strengthen their defence. 

The 24-year-old has been capped 24 times by Costa Rica and has scored once for his nation.

The Baggies are also interested in his Costa Rica compatriot, midfielder Yeltsin Tejeda of Deportivo Saprissa.

Tejeda, 22, played in all of the central American country's matches during the World Cup in Brazil.

Meanwhile, England goalkeeper Ben Foster has signed a new four-year contract with the club.

Foster was part of the England squad who were knocked out of the World Cup in the group stages.
