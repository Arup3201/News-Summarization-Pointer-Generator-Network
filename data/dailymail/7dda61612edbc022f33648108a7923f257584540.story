Aston Martin today launched its new 183mph flagship supercar - the Vanquish.

Built at the firm’s Gaydon headquarters in Warwickshire and priced from £189,995, the second generation Vanquish is on sale now for delivery in ‘late 2012’.

Powered by a 6.0 litre V12 engine 
developing 565 brake horse power, the two-door ‘2 plus 2’ seater coupe 
accelerates 0-62mph in 4.1 seconds – a fraction faster than the Bentley -
but has a lower top speed.

It has a six speed automatic gear box with F1 paddles for manual override.

Va va voom: Aston Martin said the new Vanquish is the firm's most potent production model yet, and is outmuscled only by the strictly limited edition £1.2million One-77 supercar

Flagship beast: Aston Martin chief executive Dr Ulrich Bez calls the Vanquish 'the ultimate expression of Aston Martin design ethos, engineering innovation and technical ability'

Aston Martin said the new Vanquish is 
the firm’s ‘most potent production model yet’ and is ‘outmuscled only by
the strictly limited edition £1.2million One-77 supercar’.

Luxury and technical touches include a lightweight but super-strong aluminium, magnesium and carbon-fibre composite body; carbon-fibre ‘skirt’ trim, 20 inch alloy wheels, full-grain leather interior with alcantara headlining, titanium meshes on bonnet and side-strakes.

Top of its game: Powered by a 6.0 litre V12 engine developing 565 brake horse power, the Vanquish accelerates 0-62mph in 4.1 seconds, a fraction faster than the Bentley

For the first time in an Aston Martin, and inspired by racing car technology, super light but super-strong carbon fibre is used to make every external panel.

Each panel has been carefully sculpted to direct the airflow around the car, into the engine and to help cool the braking system.

The carbon fibre elements are 
produced using advanced manufacturing techniques developed from the 
aerospace and motorsport industries, and enable the designers to create 
aerodynamic shapes – such that would be ‘impossible’ with other 
materials, they say.

Aston Martin’s design director Marek Reichman said: ‘There are no restrictions on form or shape when using carbon fibre.’

Aston Martin chief executive Dr 
Ulrich Bez said: ‘The Vanquish is the ultimate expression of Aston 
Martin design ethos, engineering innovation and technical ability.

'It offers luxurious, continent-crossing capability and pure driving excitement without compromise.

‘I believe the car unveiled today once again puts this great British brand at the top of its class.

'It also represents the perfect way to signal the beginning of our centenary celebrations next year.’
