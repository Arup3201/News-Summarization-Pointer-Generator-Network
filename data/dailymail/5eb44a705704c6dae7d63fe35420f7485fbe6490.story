The sale of alcohol has been banned in Broome after a woman was run over by a police car on Saturday night when police attended an alcohol-fueled brawl involving over 150 men.

Police arrived at the Town Beach park in Broome after being alerted to the large group of locals drunkenly fighting at the popular picnic spot just after 4pm.

The woman was allegedly lying on the ground and intoxicated, when an officer attempted to drive the police van forward in an effort to aid his colleagues contain the brawl and ran over her.

Kimberley District Superintendent Mick Sutherland said that those in the area were 'already fighting among themselves,' reported The West Australian. 

The woman has been taken to the Royal Perth Hospital hospital with six broken ribs and a fractured wrist, but her injuries are reported to not be life-threatening.

Broome Liquor Accord has banned the sale of take-away alcohol in a voluntary motion, and Superintendent Sutherland said that the local police would continue a zero-tolerance approach to street drinking. 

Officers were reportedly afraid for their safety, with one officer punched in the head and neck and another hit in the face.

Superintendent Sutherland said that enough was enough, and that Indigenous leaders needed to take responsibility for relaying the message to their community before someone was killed.

'An officer attempted to arrest one of the males and handcuff him, when the group surrounded police and set upon officers,' said Superintendent Sutherland. 

'Indigenous leaders and elders need to get a very important message back to their people to behave themselves before someone is killed.'

'We will have to take two police vehicles off the road and replace them with two vehicles from remote communities, which will have to go without patrols.'

'This is the knock-on effect. These people are the first to contact us when they are in trouble, yet they attack our officers and equipment that are needed to keep people safe.'

Police vehicles also suffered attacks, with many of the van windows broken and several panels kicked in.

Four people were charged with offences including assaulting police, criminal damage and escaping legal custody. 

In September this year police attended to a drunken post-match brawl involving 300 people, during which police and local houses were pelted with glass bottles.

The large fight also prompted a temporary ban on the sale of alcohol, with local community members expressing outrage over the violence, reported The ABC.
