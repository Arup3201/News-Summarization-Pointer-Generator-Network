The family of a man who was slain is outraged that a woman convicted in his death received only a four-year prison sentence for her crime.

Peggy Sue Thomas, 47, a former Ms. Washington beauty queen, received the sentencing after she pleaded guilty to plotting the murder of Russel Douglas.

Douglas was found shot to death in his car two days after Christmas in 2003.

'It seems like a travesty of the basic sense of justice that she would be sentenced to less than four years in prison for the cold and premeditated act that could not have happened without her involvement,' the victim’s father, Jim Douglas, said in court on Friday, ABC News  Seattle affiliate KOMO reported.

Turning to Thomas in court, he said, 'I hope [prison] will be a living hell for you.'

'In a few short days you'll be placed in
a shark tank as a piece of fresh meat,' he added. 'I'm sure they 
will appreciate all that fine plastic surgery.'

Prosecutors said Thomas and her then-boyfriend, James Huden, lured Douglas into a remote area so Huden could shoot him.

Huden was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to 80 years in prison.

Prosecutors say the murder was plotted out of revenge, with Huden and Thomas suspecting that Douglas was abusing his wife and kids.

Thomas worked at a hair salon with Douglas's wife.

Thomas, who was crowned Ms Washington
in 2000 and has had a string of failed marriages since, had faced a 
first-degree murder charge until the plea deal that was struck on 
January 24. 

That trial was due to begin just a week before she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge.

After sentencing, Jim Douglas, the victim's father, called Thomas 'the most despicable of human species.'

Huden, who was arrested in Mexico in 2005, was convicted of first-degree murder last summer and sentenced to 80 years.

Thomas was arrested in July 2011 on her houseboat, called Off the Hook, near Farmington, New Mexico.

Huden could have been faced a much slimmer sentence if he had testified against Thomas, but he refused.

A motive for the murder was never 
established, but reports suggested the duo had planned to kill Douglas 
out of revenge because they suspected him of abusing his wife and 
children.

Thomas knew Douglas' wife Brenna, who owned the salon where the former beauty queen worked.

'It was some weird karmic revenge thing.
I’m not sure if that was the motive or the only motive. There were a 
lot of theories about what the motives were,' prosecutor Greg Banks told The Seattle Times.

After her 2000 pageant victory, Peggy Sue got married - a few times.

One of those nuptials was a short-lived marriage to Alaska oil tycoon Mark Allen.

Allen's horse Mine That Bird, won the Kentucky Derby in 2009 - the same year the couple divorced, according to a 2011 profile in Seattle Weekly.

After being arrested and posting $500,000 bail, Thomas made headlines for her post-jail travels.

She was allowed by a judge to take a two-week, five-state road trip so she can attend her half-sister's memorial service, go to the dentist and pick up winter clothes, after her release.

The trips took her to New Mexico, Utah and Nevada to take care of a few chores - preparing to sell a house and picking up her winter clothes, among other things.
