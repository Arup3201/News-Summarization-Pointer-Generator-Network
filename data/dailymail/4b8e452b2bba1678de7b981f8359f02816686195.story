Energy giants will be forced to compensate customers if they are mis-sold products, under a crackdown on rogue selling.

New powers will be handed to the regulator not only to fine firms which dupe consumers, but to force suppliers to reimburse them and provide compensation.

It has been hailed as a victory for the consumer following a series of price-fixing scandals by the Big Six energy firms which have left tens of thousands of householders out of pocket.

Big energy firms who mis-sell products to customers will have to compensation for the first time

Last month, SSE, the UK’s second largest energy supplier, was fined a record £10.5million by Ofgem for ‘prolonged and extensive’ mis-selling which affected up to 23,000 customers.

But while thousands of compensation claims have been lodged, it is unclear how many will be successful and whether they will be paid back in full.

Government sources said this new power, to be included in next month’s Energy Bill, would give the regulator the ‘teeth’ they need to force firms to give redress to victims.

Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which? said: ‘Mis-selling is totally unacceptable whether in energy, banking or any other industry that people rely on.

‘A series of scandals have ruined consumer confidence in energy, and our latest research shows that less than a quarter of people say they trust suppliers. This change can't come a minute too soon for fed up and cash strapped consumers.’

Adam Scorer, policy director at 
Consumer Futures said: ‘It’s a victory for the consumer. Mis-selling has
been a stain on the energy market since the introduction of 
competition. 

‘While the situation has got better, 
the recent history casts a long shadow. We fully supports Ofgem getting 
greater powers to benefit customers rather than the Exchequer when 
issuing fines’.

The proposed new law is intended to 
radically simplify the energy market, after David Cameron said the 
number of different energy plans and tariffs on offer was ‘bewildering’ 
for consumers.

More than eight out of ten customers 
pay too much for their energy because they are not aware of the cheapest
tariff, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change.

Consumer groups backed the move to help people with their energy bills

It is expected to force each firm to offer only a handful of different tariffs; make it clear to customers if they could save money on a cheaper plan, and offer easier options for switching such as via smartphones and ‘collective switching’ websites where thousands of people can put pressure on their suppliers to reduce their prices.

Millions of people on ‘dead’ tariffs which are no longer available, particularly the vulnerable elderly, will be automatically switched to the best deal for their circumstances to save up to £150 a year.

Ofgem currently has the powers to investigate energy firms which it believes to have incorrectly sold products, failed to help vulnerable customers, or acted anti-competitively.

If they are found to have breached their licence conditions, they can be fined up to 10 per cent of turnover. But this money simply goes into the Treasury’s coffers unless the firm chooses to compensate their customers.

SSE offered £1.5million to repay its customers last month after it was exposed for having lied about the savings households could make by switching from other firms.

But while 11,000 people lodged claims for compensation, this would give each victim only £65, when the first 4,400 claims processed by the company found an average customer loss of £100.

EDF was last year fined £4.5million after its doorstep salespeople were found to have exaggerated the financial savings customers could make by switching from other providers.

After negotiating an agreement though Ofgem, it agreed to pay £3.5million to 70,000 ‘vulnerable’ customers at risk of fuel poverty, and agreed to fund a £1million helpline.

But an Ofgem document published afterwards said they were urging ministers to make it a legal obligation to compensate all customers who were mis-sold, to send out a strong message.

It stated: ‘Ofgem does not have the power to compel companies who are found in breach of their licence conditions to provide redress, including compensation to customers but it is seeking such powers from government.

‘If granted, these powers would strengthen Ofgem’s ability to take more targeted action against companies who have breached their licences, including directing funds to customers where appropriate.’

Jo Ganly at uswitch said: ‘The regulator wanted this power, so this is great news. It will have full powers you would expect to protect the needs of consumers if this is made law.’

A government source told the Mail: ‘At a time of rising bills and concerns about the cost of living, this is intended to put power back in the hands of the consumer. The Big Six will be made to toe the line, so customers who are ripped off can claim compensation.’
