Captain Scott Brown and winger James Forrest have been left out of the Celtic squad for the final Europa League Group D game against Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia on Thursday night.

The Hoops have already qualified for the knockout stages and Brown is one booking away from a suspension while Forrest is still coming back to full fitness after injury.

Ineligible striker John Guidetti drops out again while midfielder Charlie Mulgrew (knee) and defender Jason Denayer (foot) are unavailable to manager Ronny Deila.

James Forrest is sent tumbling by Motherwell's Simon Ramsden, who was sent off for this tackle, on Saturday

Captain Scott Brown has also been left behind with Celtic already through to the knockout phase

Right-back Mikael Lustig has recovered from a hamstring injury but the game comes too soon for him.

Speaking at Glasgow Airport before the team flew out, assistant manager John Collins said: 'Scott Brown has been left behind. He is on a booking so we will rest him and I think he deserves a little rest.

'James Forrest stayed at home, he will be ready for the weekend.

'But we will approach it the same as every other game, the exact same preparation.

'We will treat them with respect. We want a good performance and we want to finish the group on a high.

Ronny Deila's side have won their last three matches in all competitions heading in to Thursday's tie

'The lads have done terrifically well in qualifying.

'It is a nice position to be in but ultimately we want a result and we want a performance.

'We can go and enjoy the game but you only enjoy it if you play well and get a result.

'There is a chance there will be one or two changes but not too many changes, that is always dangerous.'
