Troubled Rangers have been left in utter disarray after caretaker manager Kenny McDowall dramatically tendered his resignation after just three matches in charge of the crisis-torn Ibrox outfit.

The 51-year triggered a 12 month notice period in his contract when he informed the Glasgow club he was to step down 'for personal reasons'.

McDowall had been assistant to Ally McCoist but replaced the Ibrox icon in the hotseat in December after McCoist tendered his own resignation and was subsequently placed on gardening leave by the embattled Rangers board.

In a brief statement, Rangers  said McDowall would 'remain 100 per cent committed to his normal duties' – suggesting he will carry on as Rangers manager during the period of his notice.

But there remains the possibility that he could eventually follow McCoist into a period of gardening leave – if the cash-strapped club can find the money amid their current financial woes.

McDowall was in charge of Rangers for just three games, starting with a 4-0 defeat at Easter Road. He also oversaw a 3-1 home win over Dumbarton and a 1-0 victory over Alloa at Indodrill Stadium.

His last match was against Hearts last Friday but the contest was abandoned at 0-0 after 25 minutes due to snowfall in Glasgow. His announcement last night came with Rangers trailing 13 points behind leaders Hearts after 20 Championship games and looking destined for a place in the play-offs.

Rangers posted a brief statement on the club website.

It read: 'Kenny McDowall has tendered his resignation as caretaker manager of Rangers Football Club, citing personal reasons for stepping down.

'Kenny, who has been a fantastic servant of the club, will serve his 12-month notice period, during which time he will remain 100% committed to his normal duties.

'The club respects Kenny's decision and he will continue to have the full support of everybody at Rangers.'
