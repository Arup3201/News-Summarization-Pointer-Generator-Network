Two breeds of dogs from distinct regions of the globe will make their debut at Westminster next February.

The rollout of the Coton de Tulear, originating from Madagascar, and the wirehaired vizsla, from Hungary, follows their full recognition from the American Kennel Club earlier this year.

The heads of the breeds' American clubs joined Luna and Falko, representative dogs of the breeds, to announce their introduction at Madison Square Garden Tuesday.

The wirehaired vizsla was a breeding variation on the vizsla that would allow it to cope with the harsh climate of northern Hungary, where they were used to hunt game.

True to the breed's relaxed form, Falko lounged on the floor while waiting to make his debut in front of the press. 

The breed is 'really easygoing to live with,' Wirehaired Vizsla Club of America president Jean Schroeder told the Associated Press by phone from Indiana.

Schroeder stress the need for a yard or several miles of walks throughout the day.

The United States of America Coton de Tulear Club says the dog, which originated in Madagascar, was first popular among the poor households before being taken into wealthier homes.

According to the club, the Coton de Tulear is the 'Royal Dog of Madagascar.'

'They're just very adaptable, and they like everybody' said Luna's West Virginia breeder and co-owner, Adrianne Dering, about the breed.

Easygoing: Falko the wirehaired vizsla leaned in for a kiss from Adrianne Dering, who owns Luna the Coton de Tulear

Adaptable: Luna sits surrounded by press for an event at Madison Square Garden announcing dogs for the Westminster Dog Show

Groomed: Luna will compete in the non-sporting group while Falko (not pictured) will be part of the sporting group, as the wirehaired vizslas are known for their hunting prowess

'I say they're a big dog in a small dog's boots,' Dering added.

There were some playful moments, when Falko stretched from under the arm of owner Anton Sagh of Montreal to get a kiss on the nose from Dering.

The new class at the American Kennel Club last year included the Chinook, rat terrier and Portuguese Podengo Pequeno. 

The American Kennel Club requires at least 150 individual dogs to be registered before it recognizes a breed. 

A fight between Coton de Tulear clubs has taken place over whether to seek recognition, with groups like the American Coton Club and the Coton de Tulear Club of America opposing the American Kennel Club, accusing it of encouraging unsafe commercial breeding.
