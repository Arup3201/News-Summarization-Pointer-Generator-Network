Roberto Martinez and his Everton squad have arrived in Switzerland to prepare for their Europa League battle against Young Boys on Thursday.

The first-leg of their last 32 encounter in Bern pitches Everton against the Swiss Super League’s second side, who are eight points off Basle at the top.

Whereas the picture is quite different for Roberto Martinez's side who are just five points above the Premier League relegation zone but a Europa League victory could appease any worries about the drop.

Last time out for Everton, on February 11, they lost 1-0 at Chelsea in a fiery but promising contest.

Their valiant display was overshadowed by a brawl at the end of the defeat at Stamford Bridge. Gareth Barry was sent off for a second bookable offence after tripping Willian.

That particular foul sparked a melee between both sides in which Branislav Ivanovic locked his arm around James McCarthy’s neck. As a result Chelsea and Everton were charged by the FA for failing to control the conduct of their players.
