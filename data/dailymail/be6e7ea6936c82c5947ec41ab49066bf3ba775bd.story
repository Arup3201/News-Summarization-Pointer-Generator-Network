She is the Oxford University-educated socialite and entrepreneur who counts Prince Andrew as one of her nearest and dearest friends.

And Goga Ashkenazi certainly looked like she meant business as she stepped out in Milan today.

The 32-year-old businesswoman oozed glamour and poise as she left a business lunch in the Italian city this afternoon.

Dressed in a stylish black wrap dress, Goga wore her hair in a tight bun and accessorised with statement gold jewellery and white shades.

The tanned businesswoman carried a black folder and black barrel bag as she made her way through the streets of her hometown.

The impeccably connected Kazakh, who was raised in Moscow and educated in the UK, has worked in a variety of industries from oil to finance.

However, her latest venture is in fashion and in May she
bought the iconic French label Vionnet, whose fans include Madonna and Natalie Portman.

She took an extremely hands-on role at the fashion house and has even been reported to have tried her hand as a designer.

Speaking at the time of acquisition, she said: ‘Fashion is my passion and I spent a 
long time trying to find the right label to buy. Vionnet fitted like a 
glove. It’s elegance with a twist.

‘I
want to be very hands-on. I have many ideas. In time I hope to be 
involved with the design front. We also want to open a flagship Vionnet 
store in Paris.’

Proving that she is both beauty and brains, the stylish intellect worked at top financial institutions such as Merrill Lynch before turning her hand to fashion.

She quickly gained notoriety as a close friend of Prince Andrew who she was first introduced to in 2001 by Lord Hanson's son Robert and has been very close with ever since.

She was his guest at Ascot in 2007, although she denies rumours 
that they were ever an item.

Goga is known for favouring a very luxurious lifestyle.

With a personal staff of 15, including chefs, butlers, maids, nannies and bodyguards, the immensely rich Goga, who eats caviar for breakfast, once spoke out to insist she is not materialistic.

‘I could live on $1,000-a-month easily. I can do everything — I don’t want to, and I don’t need to, but I could.

'If one day something happens, then I will build myself back up again, because I know I am young and able,' she said.

She has two children by her on-off partner, oil billionaire Timur Kulibayev, who famously bought Prince Andrew’s former home, Sunninghill Park, for £15 million.

Her two boys were cared for by Russian nannies until they were two years old.

Speaking about parenthood, she said: ‘When they are small they are not really aware you are there,

‘I’ve proven that because Adam doesn’t remember his first nannies at all.

‘So clearly working mothers don’t need to feel guilty for at least the first two years.’
