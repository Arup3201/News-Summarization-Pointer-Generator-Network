An X Factor hopeful who wowed judges last night has told of her heartache after her step-brother drowned in a filthy swimming pool days after her audition.

Youth worker Monica Michael, 24, is struggling to cope with the death of Savvakis Georgiou, 18, who slipped and fell into a hotel pool in the Cypriot party town of Ayia Napa.

The promising footballer is reported to have been remained unseen at the bottom of the Kalypso Hotel pool for 20 minutes because the water was filled with condoms, syringes and cigarette butts.

Ms Michael, from London, said: 'It's hard to believe that he was at my audition and now he is no longer here.

'Sav was a huge, huge fan of The X factor and he always wanted to see the show and how it was run and I was happy that he got to witness my audition before he died.

'It was really hard to watch the show on Saturday without him and I just hope that he is at peace in heaven.'

The singer said that her stepbrother had been on a boys' holiday to celebrate his recent signing to League Two football club Stevenage FC when he drowned in the pool on August 18.

Despite there being more than 20 people in the swimming pool, it has been claimed nobody spotted he was in trouble until a female swimmer tripped over his body at the bottom of the pool. 

'It was full of condoms, syringes and cigarette butts and nobody could see his body at the bottom because it was so dirty,' said Ms Michael.

'If it was not for the fact that it was so filthy, maybe someone could have seen him sooner and saved his life.

'It is so devastating and sad that he drowned in an algae-ridden hotel swimming pool.'

Several people tried to revive the teen, but he was pronounced dead at Famagusta Hospital with a post mortem confirming that he had drowned in the early hours of August 18.

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini wiped away a tear as she was reminded of her own sister by a touching tribute song

The teen, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, had travelled to Ayia Napa with his cousin on August 17 after visiting his grandparents for four days in nearby Protaras.

On last night's show, Ms Michael performed a song she wrote for her sister Natalie, 16, called Pretty Little Sister.

She told the judges she wrote the song as a cautionary tale after she had rebelled and gone off the rails but had been saved by music.

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini was moved by her performance and said she was reminded of a time when her own sister would write poems to her.

She said: 'It really touched me because my sister writes me poems and she has since I was little and so I completely related to that song.'

The signer received four unanimous Yes votes from the panel.

Her family celebrated with Ms Michael and said they were very proud of her performance
