The first woman bishop could be announced within months, the Archbishop of Canterbury revealed today.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said he was ‘hopeful’ the Church of England’s ruling Synod would scrap the ‘incomprehensible’ ban on women priests being ordained as bishops.

But he said groups opposed to move would be allowed to ‘flourish’ within the Church.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said the Church had been wrong on women bishops 'theologically' for centuries

The two sides in the debate have become bitterly divided since a controversial vote in November 2012 saw the idea of women bishops defeated by just six votes.

The General Synod will vote on the issue again this week, with the Archbishop warning the issue should have been settled years ago.

He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show: ‘I think to the general public this is almost incomprehensible and it’s equally incomprehensible that we are still talking about it.

‘I am hopeful it will pass. I’m not actually focused on what happens if it fails…’

Asked when the first women bishop would be appointed, he added: ‘There is a good chance of the first woman bishop being announced very early in 2015, probably being chosen possibly before that.

‘Theologically the church has been wrong not to ordain women as priests and bishops over the centuries.’

Supporters of women bishops have said they are hopeful of success but others have said they remained concerned as the General Synod has the same membership as in 2012.

The Archbishop said he would be 'delighted' to see a woman take his role in his lifetime

Margaret Condick, a lay member of the General Synod from the St Edmundsbury and Ipswich diocese, said the collapse of legislation to introduce women bishops in November 2012 had led people to treat the Church of England with contempt.

Last week she urged members of the General Synod to vote in favour of final approval for women bishops when a key vote takes place on Monday at at York University.

"People say 'why have you taken so long, what is the problem?' It is incomprehensible to most people," she told the General Synod.

"Someone I know and respect from the evangelical Church said to me after the November 2012 debate 'that was rubbish what is happening?' The vote brought us into disrepute, the wider Church and the whole country is beginning to treat us with contempt."

Mediation and conflict management experts were brought in to help resolve differences between Anglo-Catholics and conservative evangelicals opposed to women's ordination and supporters of women bishops.

Rev Welby added: ‘Women will be bishops like all other bishops with

no distinction at all, but we will seek for the groups who disagree with the ordination of women as bishops on theological grounds to continue to flourish within the church.’
