Jose Mourinho accused referees of all but deciding the Premier League title after losing his 77-game unbeaten League record at Stamford Bridge with defeat by Sunderland.

The Chelsea manager was furious with officials for awarding a penalty when Cesar Azpilicueta brought down Jozy Altidore and Fabio Borini, a former Chelsea striker who is at Sunderland on loan from title rivals Liverpool, made it 2-1 from the penalty spot.

Mourinho blasted Dean and referee’s chief Mike Riley, aiming a sarcastic rant at the officials — even though his own assistant Rui Faria was sent off for an extraordinary rant after the spot-kick when he had to be restrained by fellow members of the back-room team.

‘Just to 
say I will not wait for your questions,’ said Mourinho. ‘I’m so sorry 
about it. But in three or four points I can say everything I can say, so
 I won’t waste time with the questions you will ask me.

‘The
 first is to congratulate my players. They did everything they could, 
playing from the first minute to the last seconds, and deserved that. 
Sometimes we praise the players when we win. I think it’s fair to praise
 my players after the defeat.

‘Secondly,
 congratulations to Sunderland. It doesn’t matter how, why or in which 
way they won, they won. They won three fantastic points. I think it’s 
also fair to congratulate them.

‘Third
 point, I want to congratulate again Mike Dean. I think his performance 
was unbelievable and I think when referees have unbelievable 
performances, I think it’s fair that as managers we give them praise. 
So, fantastic performance. He came here with one objective. To make a 
fantastic performance. And he did that.

‘And
 fourth, congratulations also to Mike Riley, the referees’ boss. What 
they are doing through the whole season is fantastic, especially in the 
last couple of months, and in teams involved in the title race. 
Absolutely fantastic.’

'Doing a great job': Mike Riley sends off Chelsea's Michael Ballack in 2006. The former Leeds official has been manager of the  Professional Game Match Officials Board since 2009

A former Premier League referee, Riley officiated two matches in Euro 2004.

Following retirement in 2009, he was appointed manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Board.

He apologised to then West Brom boss Steve Clarke after a last-minute penalty awarded at Stamford Bridge denied the Baggies a famous win in November of last year.

Faria’s
 furious touchline outburst could leave Mourinho’s No 2 in trouble 
with the Football Assciation, with the incident sure to feature in 
Dean’s report tomorrow morning. To compound that, midfielder Ramires is 
facing a four-game suspension himself after TV replays caught the 
Brazilian aiming an elbow at Seb Larsson late in the first half.

The result means Liverpool can extend their lead over Chelsea at the top to five points with victory at Norwich.

It
 was Mourinho’s first defeat in a home league game as Chelsea manager, 
in his 78th match at Stamford Bridge. He has won 61 of those and drawn 
16. The last team to win away at Chelsea in the league were QPR back in 
January 2013 (1-0).

Sunderland
 became only the second away side to score more than once at Stamford 
Bridge in the league this season after West Brom.

Down in the dumps: Mourinho reiterated his thoughts in his post-match press conference

Their
 captain John O’Shea said: ‘Have a guess what the manager’s half-time 
team talk was? Be the team to beat that record. What will the headlines 
be in the morning now?

‘Obviously,
 with the position we’re in, people are writing us off. We had the 
belief that when we can play we can beat anybody. We can’t just do it 
against the so-called big teams, we have to do it every week and then 
we’ll get a chance.

‘The
 manager deserves a lot of credit. I think Mike Dean was very brave [to 
give the penalty]. We have to believe we can stay up. We’ve given 
ourselves a great chance.’

Chelsea
 took the lead through Samuel Eto’o in the 12th minute but Poyet’s side 
equalised within six minutes after Connor Wickham capitalised on Mark 
Schwarzer’s mistake. Schwarzer was deputising for first-choice Petr Cech
 who was suffering with an illness.

And
 the decisive moment arrived eight minutes from time as former Blues 
striker Borini scored from the spot. He said: ‘It was three points for 
the game and Chelsea were up for the league and we showed we have great 
character and great belief.’

Poyet,
 whose side moved to within three points of safety, admitted Sunderland 
were fortunate to be awarded the match-winning penalty. ‘If it was 
against me, I would have reacted the same,’ he said.

‘Emotion, key moment in the season, it could be the key moment for the title, that one.

‘When
 it’s for you, you feel you can see why he gave it. Especially the 
linesman when Azpilicueta goes down. ‘But if it was against me, in a 
situation like that, I would have been fuming, for sure.’
