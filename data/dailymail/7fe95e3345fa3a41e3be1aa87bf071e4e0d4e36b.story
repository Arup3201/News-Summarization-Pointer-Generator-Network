Nigel Pearson has expressed regret that director of football Terry Robinson has left Leicester City.

Robinson was dismissed on Sunday by chief executive Susan Whelan, with the club deciding last summer’s transfer business fell below expectations.

Robinson negotiated deals for £10million Leonardo Ulloa and the free transfer of Esteban Cambiasso, having arrived in July 2013 with the task of streamlining club cash-flow to meet Financial Fair Play regulations.

'I’m disappointed to see him go, I got on very well with Terry both on a personal and business level,’ said Pearson. 'I wish him the best and I think we worked well together. It’s a decision that was made from above.

'It’s not for me to talk about in the public domain. I’m neither prepared or in a position to add much more to that. If you need more on that you need to ask the questions to somebody else. I’m the team manager.’ 

Jon Rudkin has replaced Robinson for the January transfer window and will be required to get deals across the line with Leicester eager to bring in reinforcements. 

'As every window is there’s a lot of speculation around certain targets and whether a change has a knock-on effect on business, I cant give you the answer,’ Pearson added.
