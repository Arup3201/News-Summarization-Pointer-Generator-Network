A 27-year-old Kansas City-area man has being identified as the alleged gunman in a dozen recent highway shootings that have wounded three people.

Jackson County prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said at a news conference Friday that Mohammed Pedro Whitaker, of Grandview, has been charged with 18 felony counts and is being held on $1million cash bail.

Baker said Whitaker was charged with two counts of shooting into a motor vehicle and injuring a person, seven counts of shooting into a motor vehicle and nine counts of armed criminal action.

Caught: Mohammed Whitaker, 27, of Grandview, Missouri,  has been charged with 18 felony counts in connection with about a dozen recent highway shootings that have wounded three people

Evidence: Police confiscated Whitaker's dark green Dodge Neon registered to his father

At least six of the shootings occurred near Grandview. The Kansas City suburb is home to an area known as the Grandview Triangle, where three interstates and U.S. 50 intersect.

Other shootings were reported in the Missouri suburbs of Blue Springs and Lee's Summit and Leawood, Kansas.

Two of the wounded drivers were shot in the leg, and the third was struck in the arm. None of their injuries was considered life-threatening.

The last confirmed shooting believed to be connected to Whitaker was reported April 6, about a month after the spree began.

‘I'm so pleased tonight might be a night to sleep. It's been so many nights without that for us,’ said Baker.

Whitaker was taken into custody Thursday at a home near Interstate 49, one of the highways that intersects at the Grandview Triangle. Some 30 police officers who swarmed the dwelling also confiscated a dark green Dodge Neon.

The license plates on the car were registered to the suspect's father, who was stunned by the allegations made against his son.

Underachiever: Whitaker dropped out of a technical college and was working for a medical supply company

Blindsided: His father said he had no idea his son could even fire a gun

‘I thought everything was okay with him,’ his father told Kansas City Star. ‘I just thought he was working and trying to pay off his college bills.’

According to the father, his son Mohammed called him April 7 - a day after the last reported shooting - asking him for money to tie him over until his payday. He sent him $50.

The 27-year-old, who had dropped out of a technical college, worked for the medical supply company OptumRx affiliated with UnitedHealth Group in Overland Park.

His father said he had heard of the shooting spree but never thought his son was behind it.

‘To my knowledge, he’s never fired a gun,’ said the dad. ‘I’m totally shocked by all this.’

Investigators have yet to find a motive. It is believed that Whitaker acted alone.

Police began noticing a pattern about two weeks ago after receiving reports of apparently random shootings at vehicles.

Earlier this month, investigators were looking into about 20 reports of shootings, but that number has fluctuated.

Late last week, police said they had connected a dozen shootings to the same person, but they have said little else about how the incidents were linked or what kind of vehicle the suspect drove.

Police did not say what led them to the suspect. The station 41 Action News reported that on April 11, officers acting on a tip watched as Whitaker tried to buy a .380 handgun equipped with laser sight in a parking lot.

On Wednesday, the suspect was spotted driving erratically to catch up with another car. 

A reward of up to $10,000 was offered for information leading to an arrest. Police haven't said if anyone will be claiming the reward money.

An unnamed suspect has been taken into custody in connection with a string of random highway shootings that left three people wounded in the Kansas City, Missouri, area.

Investigators have looked into as many as 20 reported highway shootings as part of their investigation.

One woman said she was driving down the road with her three-year-old child when a figure in a ski-mask driving beside her opened fire, narrowly missing the youngster.

Witness Tom McFarlane told KMBC-TV: 'I
 was just driving down the highway and heard a loud noise. Something hit
 the car, didn't know what it was, so I pulled over at my first 
opportunity to kind of see if there was any damage and that's when I saw
 the bullet hole.' 

One witness claimed the shooter was wearing a ski-mask and just missed her three-year-old child who also in the car

Kansas City Police and the FBI had been offering a $7,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the unidentified suspect

Most of the shootings were reported in an area in the southern part of Kansas City known as the Grandview Triangle where three interstate highways and U.S. 50 intersect.

Local police called in help from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

A $10,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the capture of the attacker. The first incident was reported to police on March 8.

Luckily, no one was killed but two victims have been hit in the legs and a third received a gunshot wound to the arm.

Ginny Bauer said she was driving a friend home when she was hit by a bullet.

'There wasn't another car in sight and we were in the right lane and hit on the right side," she said
