When the residents of a small village heard a huge static caravan was being transported to an illegal travellers’ site, they expected the police to take immediate action.

What they didn’t expect were notices saying their cars would be towed away if they didn’t move them as the caravan was given a police escort through their main street.

‘Any vehicle that is obstructing this movement will be towed away at the owner’s expense,’ the signs warned car owners in South Harting, West Sussex.

Left a bit: A motorbike and a Land Rover from Sussex Police accompanied the 15-foot wide load to a field which has already been declared as illegal

The 15ft by 40ft caravan – thought to have cost up to £20,000 and to have two bedrooms – was being delivered to a site which has been ruled illegal, but is subject to a planning appeal.

As it slowly lumbered through the village yesterday, struggling to negotiate narrow bends and pulled by a lorry and escorted by two police vehicles, residents stood and watched in disbelief.

David Barnard, chairman of the parish council, said: ‘If they are not allowed there, isn’t now the time to stop another vehicle going on the site, instead of helping it? The concern is once there is  permission for two caravans, suddenly there will be 22.’

The extra wide load - described by police as a 'caravan', by planners as 'a mobile home' - is so wide it could not come down a direct route from the main east-west A 272 road through West Sussex

Joe Newton, 47, a builder, said: ‘It is an illegal site and the whole thing is incredibly hypocritical. It is opening the floodgates to something far bigger than a couple of mobile homes.’

Two caravans have occupied Three-Cornered Piece, a mile away from South Harting, a beauty spot in the South Downs National Park, since 2009 after travellers bought the five-acre site and moved in on a Bank Holiday weekend.

A traveller said yesterday: ‘They might as well get used to it because we’re going to be there for a long time.’

Notices were placed on villagers' car 
windscreens two days ago reading: 'Will owners of vehicles please make 
sure that there (sic) vehicles are removed from these roads until after 
the abnormal load has passed, which should hopefully be by 2pm Friday'.

Two concrete bases for caravans have been laid at the camp. The travellers have made a retrospective planning application for them and a septic tank, but it has yet to be considered by council planners.The caravan is so wide it could not come down a direct route from the main east-west route through West Sussex. It was escorted by police from Petersfield, five miles away, through South Harting’s village square.

A mother of two, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is absolutely outrageous. I live in a Grade II-listed house with leaking windows that needs rewiring and new plumbing, but when I applied for planning permission it was refused. I’ve got two children and no central heating but these guys can just move in. It is bang out of order.’ 

Neil Simpson, 50, said: ‘When I had a little touring caravan the council came down on me like ton of bricks. They told me to take it away so I did, because that’s what people like us have to do. There are perhaps two laws being applied.’

Official response: A Chichester District Council spokesman said they understood residents' concerns about the delivery of the caravan, adding that a planing stop notice will prevent more than two mobile homes being erected on the land

A Chichester District Council spokesman said they understood residents’ concerns about the delivery of the caravan, adding: ‘We have taken action in a number of different ways.

‘There is a planning stop notice which prohibits more than two mobile homes and any engineering work on the land. We understand one of the mobile homes has been removed.

‘We have also served an enforcement notice requiring the removal of the mobile homes from the land, which the owners appealed against. This is now the subject of a High Court challenge.’

A police spokesman said: ‘We recognise the local sensitivities around this issue. We are playing a minor role in the event.’
