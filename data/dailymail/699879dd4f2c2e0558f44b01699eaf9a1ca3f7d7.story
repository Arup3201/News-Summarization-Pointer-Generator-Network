Under fire: President Obama has been rocked by a second national security scandal within a week of his election for a second term

General David Petraeus believed he could keep his affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell secret even after he was interviewed by the FBI, it emerged today.

After meeting Petraeus on October 21 and also conducting two interviews with Broadwell, the second on November 2nd, the FBI had concluded that no criminal charges would be brought.

But the FBI appears to have decided to inform the White House after a Florida-based agent informed a Republican member of Congress of the investigation.

This was the same agent who had triggered the inquiry when his friend the socialite Jill Kelley complained to him about anonymous harassing emails.

The fallout now threatens to engulf General John Allen of the US Marines, the Nato commander in Afghanistan. He is said to have exchanged between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of emails with Kelley since 2010.

To complicate matters further, the FBI agent had allegedly sent shirtless photos of himself to Kelley before she reported the harassing emails to him and had been told not to interfere in the investigation.

The agent, depicted by government officials as a Right-winger, contacted Representative Dave Reichert and asked for a member of the House Republican leadership. On October 31st, Reichert put him in contact with Representative Eric Cantor, House Majority Whip.

Cantor informed the FBI of his conversation with the FBI agent, now himself under internal investigation, but did not make the matter public. Cantor apparently knew of the FBI investigation into Petraeus' affair eight days before President Barack Obama.

The allegedly harassing emails were discovered to have been sent by Broadwell. It is believed that Allen received at least one email from the same email account used by Broadwell to contact Kelley.

Allen is now under investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general and his Senate confirmation hearings for the new post of Nato's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, originally due on Thursday, have been put on hold.

A senior defence official told reporters that it was alleged there had been 'inappropriatecommunications' between Leon Panetta, Defence Secretary, said in a statement 

If Allen follows Petraeus into retirement it will leave Mr Obama with two gaping holes to fill at the heart of his national security team at a time when he is also expected to be replacing his secretaries of state, defence and treasury.

It is unclear exactly when FBI Director Robert Mueller and Attorney-General Eric Holder were informed although it has emerged that the investigation began as early as May.

Obama was only informed of the scandal just two days after last Tuesday's US election, according to the White House, and accepted Petraeus's resignation the following day.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said: 'This is certainly an operationally sensitive matter.

'But we weren't briefed. I don't know who made that decision.

'So it is very puzzling and I think was a mistake, because this thing just came so fast and so hard. And since then, it's been like peeling an onion. Every day, another peel comes off.'

Representative Peter King, the Republican chair of the Homeland Security Committee said: 'This is a crisis, I believe, of major proportions.

'It's not the usual political thing. 
We're not talking about the secretary of commerce or some undersecretary
somewhere. We're talking about the heads of the FBI.'

King argued that the case 'had to 
be brought to the President, or certainly to the National Security 
Council. If not, the FBI was derelict in its duty.

'I don't want to raise any conspiracy theories, but I certainly have questions,' he said.

Panetta said 
Allen, 58,  would remain as commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan 
for now, 'while the matter is under investigation and before the facts 
are determined.'

Adultery can be considered a crime in 
the military and while as CIA director Petraeus was a civilian, the 
potential security breach could have left him open to blackmail or 
undermined his credibility with his staff.

Petraeus, who has been married to 
wife Holly for 38 years, admitted to having an affair with his 
biographer, the former Army officer Broadwell.

He
had been due to testify at closed-door congressional inquiries into the
deadly September 11 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, but 
will now be replaced at least temporarily by acting CIA Director Michael Morrell.

One name being floated as a possible replacement is John 
Brennan, the White House counter-terrorism adviser and a CIA veteran who
has played an instrumental role in Mr Obama's drone war against 
al-Qa'ida militants.

Kelley was thrust into the public eye when she was the target of supposedly threatening emails from Paula Broadwell, which the FBI used to uncover the affair between Broadwell and Petraeus, leading to the former general's resignation from the CIA.

Steven Boylan, a retired army colonel and former Petraeus spokesman, said his former boss told him over the weekend that the affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, began about two months after he became CIA director and ended four months ago.

'He is devastated, you could say, and you could also say that it's going to take a long time for the family or some time for the family to get through this, but they will,' Mr Boylan said. 

It all unravelled when a Tampa woman 
went to the FBI in the early summer after she began receiving 
threatening emails accusing her of a flirtation with the general, the 
Washington Post said.

A 
government official told The New York Post that the emails contained 
such language as: 'I know what you did', 'back off' and 'stay away from 
my guy'.

Kelley, is described as a 'social liaison officer' to the Joint Special Operations Command in Tampa. She and her husband Scott had been friends with Petraeus and his wife Holly for about five years.

The FBI soon traced the emails to Broadwell, who had been given unprecedented access to his command in Afghanistan last year to write her glowing biography.

The agents eventually discovered sexually explicit emails between Petraeus and Broadwell indicating the affair. Broadwell was found to be in possession of some classified material, but Petraeus was not thought to have given them to her.
