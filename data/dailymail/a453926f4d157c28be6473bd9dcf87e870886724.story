David Cameron ‘probably’ rode a retired police horse loaned to Rebekah Brooks, it emerged last night.

The revelation sparked fresh questions about the Prime Minister’s closeness to the former News of the World editor and to the Murdoch media empire.

Mr Cameron confirmed yesterday that he had gone riding with the journalist’s husband Charlie Brooks, who is a racehorse trainer.

Revelations: The controversy surrounding a 
decision to lend a Met Police horse to Rebekah Brooks may now involve 
the PM after senior Tory sources admitted he could have ridden Raisa 

Both are members of the so-called Chipping Norton Set, which includes Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, and which met socially until the phone hacking scandal erupted.

Mrs Brooks, who also edited The Sun, is on police bail after being quizzed by detectives last July over hacking and claims that her reporters paid police officers for stories.

Mr Cameron insisted he had not ridden Raisa, the animal at the heart of the ‘Horsegate’ affair, in his time in power.

But senior Tory sources said it was likely he had done so before he won the keys to Number 10.

Raisa, who has since died, has become the symbol of dubious links between the Metropolitan Police and Rupert Murdoch’s News International.

The horse was loaned to Mrs Brooks between 2008 and 2010, the year Mr Cameron became PM.

In an interview with Five News last night, the Prime Minister said: ‘It’s a matter of record that I have been riding with Rebekah Brooks’s husband, Charlie Brooks.

‘He is a friend of mine of 30 years standing and a neighbour in my constituency so that’s a matter of record, but since I have been Prime Minister I think I have been on a horse once and it wasn’t that one.’

A Tory source said: ‘We don’t know if he has been on Raisa. Charlie has a lot of horses. It’s possible, probable even, that he has been on that one.’

Another source close to Mr Cameron insisted the Prime Minister had no recollection of riding with Mrs Brooks.

That claim was dismissed by former News of the World features writer Paul McMullan.

He said: ‘Cameron went horse riding regularly with Rebekah. I know, because as well as door-stepping celebrities, I’ve also door-stepped my ex-boss by hiding in the bushes, waiting for her to come past with Cameron on a horse.’

Vanity Fair magazine claimed earlier this year that Mr Cameron was so close to Mrs Brooks that he signed his letters to her ‘love David’.

Mr Cameron attended the couple’s wedding in 2009 and went to Eton with Mr Brooks.

And the trainer is chair of the Heythrop hunt in Oxfordshire, which Mr Cameron has ridden with.

Defence: Rupert Murdoch stood by former News International boss Brooks following the news she was loaned a horse

Confirmation of Mr Cameron’s use of Mr Brooks’s horses came after three days in which officials refused to discuss the Prime Minister’s relationship with the trainer and his wife.

His official spokesman had tried to laugh off the affair on Wednesday, saying: ‘The only horses I am interested in are the type you can put a bet on. He has never been in a race in which I can back a horse.’

It is not clear whether Mr Cameron’s meetings with Mr Brooks were disclosed as part of No 10’s policy of openness about the Prime Minister’s contacts. Private and personal meetings are seldom listed.

‘Most of the Prime Minister’s meetings take place at rooms or at tables, and not on horseback,’ the spokesman joked.

The saga has also led to tensions between Mrs Brooks and the Metropolitan Police, who accused her of returning Raisa ‘in a poor but not serious condition’.

Mr Murdoch also defended his protégée this week, attacking Mrs Brooks’ critics on the social networking site Twitter.

‘Now they are complaining about R Brooks saving an old horse from the glue factory,’ he said.

A No 10 source admitted Downing Street accepted ‘that everyone got far too close’ – an admission that Mr Cameron should have done more to insulate himself from the Murdoch empire.

But a source close to the PM pointed out that Gordon Brown’s wife Sarah went as far as attending pyjama parties with Mrs Brooks.
