Premier League players should count themselves lucky they’re not fighting on the frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan before whinging about the busy Christmas schedule.

That’s the very direct message from Mark Noble, who has told his fellow professionals to put up or shut up as those in the top flight face the most hectic month in the calendar.

Clubs are playing seven games between now and New Year – something to have drawn heavy criticism from Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal; the Dutchman is unhappy that he can’t spend time with his wife and children.

Mark Noble says the busy festive fixtures are a tradition that shouldn't be changed

But for Noble, who has a young son, while not being able to enjoy the festivities with family is an obvious drawback, it pales into insignificance when compared with others.

‘You think about soldiers out in Afghanistan or Iraq and they are not with their families and they are getting bullets fired at them whereas we are playing in the Premier League,’ Noble said. ‘You have got to put it in perspective really.

‘It is hard if you have got family and kids and you have to leave them on Christmas Day to go and train but listen, we are a small minority of lucky players.

‘We have obviously worked hard for this, but we are lucky enough to have the ability to play in the Premier League. 

'You have to take the good with the bad and if you have to play over Christmas you have to. We have a good life and playing football over Christmas is not the worst thing in the world.’

Noble – who has broken West Ham’s Premier League appearance record – tempered any suggestion that Sam Allardyce’s side are capable of maintaining their charge towards European qualification.

But they are flying and go into Tuesday night’s game at West Brom on the back of beating in-form Newcastle at the weekend.

‘It is natural for expectations to go up. We are in a good position. If we can keep going the way we are going, who knows?’ he added. 

‘To think, we are only ten points from the bottom. Everyone keeps beating everyone.’
