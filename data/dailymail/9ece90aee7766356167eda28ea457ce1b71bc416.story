Wilfried Bony has finally arrived at Manchester City after a visa issue stalled his eagerly anticipated start to life at the Etihad.

The striker's £28million move from Swansea was confirmed a month ago but Bony was not able to train with his new club until Monday as the former Swansea striker had to renew his visa before returning from the Africa Cup of Nations.

The Ivorian is settling into life with his new club and is available for selection ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash against Newcastle.

Bony, along with new City team-mate Yaya Toure, was part of the Ivory Coast side that claimed their their first Africa Cup of Nations since 1992 in dramatic fashion after beating Ghana 9-8 on penalties in the final.

There has certainly a buzz around the Etihad since Bony's arrival was confirmed with City forward Jesus Navas stating last week that the the former Swans frontman reminds him of former Manchester City team-mate and friend Alvaro Negredo.

Navas is hoping the 26-year-old's arrival will help bring a new dimension to Manuel Pellegrini's side as they look to bridge the gap on league leaders Chelsea.

Bony will join strikers Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic at the Etihad as Negredo, nicknamed the Beast, is on loan at Valencia.

Navas told mcfc.co.uk : 'Bony is a top striker who has always performed very well when he's played against us.

'He is powerful, has good technique and excellent movement so I'm really looking forward to playing alongside him.

'He is a great addition to the strikers we already have and I think he will do really well at City. Wilfried has similar strengths to Alvaro (Negredo) in that they both play very well with their back to goal'
