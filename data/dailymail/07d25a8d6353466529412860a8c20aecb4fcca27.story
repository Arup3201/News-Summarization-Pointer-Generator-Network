People looking for an instant pick-me-up may no longer need to reach for a cup of coffee thanks to a new product that caffeinates any food or drink.

The tub of caffeine powder can be sprinkled on top of any food - or stirred into any drink - to transform it into an energy quick-fix.

Completely tasteless, it and can be used on most snacks and meals.

The tub of caffeine powder can be sprinkled on top of any food to transform it into an energy quick-fix. Steve Kingsley, a food scientist from New Jersey, warns that users should not exceed nine ¿shots¿ of the powder a day, which is the equivalent to 300mg of caffeine

Approximately three shakes of the CaffeinAll provides 100mg of caffeine, which is equivalent to the levels found a cup of strong coffee.

Once added to food or drink and swallowed, the stimulant takes effect within just five minutes, the makers claim.

The shaker was invented by Steve Kingsley, 66, for his wife who works in a gym: 'The idea came from my wife 
being a gym instructor, needing a quick and convenient way to boost her 
energy between classes.'

Mr Kingsley, a food scientist from New Jersey, does warn that users should not exceed nine ‘shots’ of the powder a day, which is the equivalent to 300mg of caffeine.

Used correctly CaffeinAll should pose no risk, but if abused, the innocuous-looking 'condiment' could pose a health risk.

The dangers of caffeine are often 
overlooked, but an increasing body of research is beginning to reveal the 
potentially life-threatening consequences of overdosing on the 
substance.

In small quantities, caffeine is usually harmless - merely providing a slight awakening effect.

The dangers of caffeine are often overlooked, but an increasing body of research is revealing the potentially life-threatening consequences of overdosing on the substance.

In small quantities, caffeine is usually harmless - merely providing a slight wakening effect.

Most people can cope with 400mg a day - the equivalent of four cups of coffee a day -  although women and those with heart conditions should consume no more than 200mg a day.

Large quantities of the substance can trigger symptoms including diarrhea, anxiety and heart problems.

Indeed last month an inquest ruled that a father of four from the West Midlands died after snacking on mints that contained 80mg of caffeine each.

Another recent study found that high-caffeineenergy drinks change the way the heart beats and could increase the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythm problems.

'CaffeinAll is sprinkled onto any food. One shot - that is a shake or sprinkle - is about 100 mg and contains 33 mg caffeine.

'A normal dose of caffeine is generally considered to be 100mg, which is roughly the amount found in a cup of strong coffee.

'Part of it dissolves in the mouth and the rest in the stomach, it is capable of crossing the blood brain barrier, so it can act very quickly.

'When taken with a food it starts acting within five minutes and achieves full effect in half an hour.

'CaffeinAll has a slight bitterness on its own, unlike caffeine which is extremely bitter. That disappears in most cases once it is consumed with the food.

'It may be detectable with very bland foods such as milk, especially if more than three shots are added.

'CaffeinAll is geared towards healthy adults, when they need a quick, convenient, and inexpensive energy boost, with the exception of pregnant women.

'It is especially beneficial before exercise for athletes and gym goers.'
