For many players, official team photographs are tedious affairs - but not for Lukas Podolski, who seems to know how to make the events fun.

The German midfielder posted a picture of Arsenal's players posing for their official team photo on Instagram - with an insert of ex-Gunner Ashley Cole 'lurking' in the corner.

Former England left-back Cole became an internet sensation for his 'lurking' during a photograph session at new side Roma and Podolski has decided to make a normally tedious event into a light-hearted affair.

Arsenal face Manchester City in the lunchtime Premier League match on Saturday at the Emirates Stadium, hoping to improve on their dreadful record in 12.45pm kick-offs last season.

Danny Welbeck is in line to make his debut up front for Arsene Wenger's side in Olivier Giroud's absence.
