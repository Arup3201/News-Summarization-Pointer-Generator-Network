A cash-strapped council has fronted £150,000 for a BBC police drama to be filmed in the town after making cuts in the budget for CCTV.  

Earlier this month it was revealed Ceredigion County Council had axed all funding for surveillance cameras in a bid to save £9.6million.

But this week residents learned filming for the second series of Hinterland will begin in the seaside town of Aberystwyth, with the council agreeing to fund the production if an application for a European Grant is turned down.

Council bosses in Aberystwyth have agreed to pay £150,000 for the production after announcing budget cuts 

The first series of Hinterland, starring Richard Harrington as DCI Tom Mathias (pictured), was filmed in the area in 2013 and allegedly brought money into the local economy 

The first series of Hinterland was filmed in the Welsh town in 2013. 

An English version of the crime drama appeared on the BBC while others tuned into a Welsh version on SC4, drawing in around 500,000 viewers between them.

When filming for the second season came into uncertainty, the council guaranteed the money claiming the 'economic benefits' of having the production in the area were worth the cost. 

Residents have slammed the decision as 'totally inappropriate'. 

'Both the BBC and SC4 already receive huge taxpayer subsidies, so council tax residents in Ceredigion will now be doubly hit hard,' said Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers Alliance.

'When public finances are so stretched it’s totally inappropriate for the Council to be funding TV shows and they need to reconsider their position immediately.'

Among budget cuts recently announced was a £150,000 reduction to CCTV, the cancellation of £44,000 in funding for a local swimming pool, an £80,000 reduction to road gritting services and the closure of two libraries.

But the council said paying for the filming will make them money, with an estimated £1million generated for the local community from the last series.  

Residents in the town described the decision as 'totally inappropriate' when the council faces such severe budget cuts 

Aberystwyth is a popular tourist resort on the west coast of Wales. It was the backdrop for the drama in its first series

A spokesman said: 'The council is pleased to be in a position to provide this underwriting facility for this successful drama series. 

'A study by ARAD Research into the economic impact of Hinterland on Aberystwyth and the surrounding area concluded that the first series generated an economic benefit of just over £1m which was a welcome injection into the local economy.

'It is hoped the economic benefit will be even greater as a result of this second series.'

'If the European Grant application is fully approved as submitted there will be no call on the council’s underwritten sum.'
