A triplex under construction atop a Manhattan skyscraper will cost would-be residents a staggering $100 million and comes with a luxury infinity-edge pool, its developers have announced.

The penthouse at the top of 50 UN Plaza will have 14 bedrooms, 13 full bathrooms, a fireplace and 1,500-square-feet of outdoor space, including the pool, when it is completed at the end of next year.

The building, designed by Norman Foster, is opposite the United Nations building and the 15,597-square-foot penthouse will provide unrivaled views of the East River and Chrysler Building.

The developers paid $160 million for the 
site in 2007 but the project was stalled for several years due to the 
recession. The 88-storey building is now tipped to be completed by December 2014.

Prices for condos in the building will start at $2.8 million for a one-bedroom unit, while two-bedroom units will range between $3.6 million and $9.4 million, according to Bloomberg News in June.

At the time, the penthouse was tipped to cost $55 million, but the company decided to change it from a duplex to a triplex in response to demand for luxury apartment space in the city, representatives from Zeckendorf Development told the Financial Times. They added that prices could still change.

The company said they hoped to attract the world's wealthiest diplomats, due to its location.

'Everything about this building is 
international, from its location and design to the people we are looking
to attract,' William Zeckendorf told the Financial Times.

'We
want to draw the wealthiest people from around the world looking for 
the finest architecture and amenities, but also those in the domestic 
market looking to trade up.'

It is being developed by Zeckendorf Development and Eyal Ofer's Global 
Holdings.

It is the London-based Foster + Partners first residential 
project in the U.S.

Although this will be one of expensive property, there are other pricier properties in the city.

Earlier this year, the Pierre Hotel 
penthouse in the Upper East Side hit the market for $125 million.

Previously owned by the late stock 
market analyst Martin Zweig, who accurately predicted the 1987 market 
crash, occupies three floors and contains 16 bedrooms, an elevator, 
staff residences, five fireplaces and four terraces.

Also in April of this year, hedge fund manager Steven Cohen's four-bedroom penthouse with stunning downtown views hit the market for $115 million.

Former Citigroup chairman Sandy Weill 
sold his apartment for $88m at 15 Central Park West in February 2012, 
and two penthouses at One57 are expected to cost $90 million.
