In an interview to celebrate his 71st birthday. Sir Alex Ferguson has spoken about the managers who could replace him, his desire to win back the title from Manchester City and why the return of his 'warrior' captain Nemanja Vidic could make the difference.

Ferguson was interviewed by Abu Dhabi Sports, when he was also asked about the prospect of Manchester United signing Mario Balotelli from their arch rivals and who he believes is the better player: Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi.

Ferguson, who also spoke highly of Robin van Persie - but did not mention Wayne Rooney once in the interview - said he is still 'hoping to stay for a bit of time' at Old Trafford.

Many happy returns: Sir Alex Ferguson gave a wide-ranging interview in Abu Dhabi on his 71st birthday

'In terms of football management, I have achieved everything I always wished for. It's been a great journey for me. But being manager of Manchester United, you have to kick on. You can't look back. The drive is always on to do better, although it's not easy in the Barclays Premier League. It's a difficult league. And European football is getting stronger and stronger.

'You have to think of where we lost it last season. We were 4-2 at Everton and didn't win. That won't happen again. Trust me. Our rivals are Manchester City and possibly Chelsea. We recovered a 12 point disadvantage to catch Newcastle one year and lost 11 point lead to Arsenal, so it's (Chelsea) is possible, but it's City who are the biggest danger.'

Asked about managers who will replace him, Ferguson said with a smile: 'There is no-one on the agenda, but somebody will have to replace me...

The fire still burns: Manchester United's manager is as combative as ever after more than 25 years at Old Trafford

'I'm hoping to stay on for a bit of time, anyway.

'It's very difficult. Over the years, names have been bandied about but football is such a precarious industry. But you could be talking about one of the potentially exciting young managers in the game, but is he going to be here in two or three years time. The sack race is horrendous.

'Sometimes a manager can only survive four games if he doesn't win a match. It's impossible to say who is going to be there.'

Ferguson is then asked about Everton's David Moyes and Jose Mourinho.

He says: 'There will always be names bandied about and they are all qualified people. Nobody knows where they are going to be in two or three years time.

'Top managers will always been in demand.

'Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho and David Moyes... there are a lot of successful managers out there. I don't know what their plans are in two or three years time.'

Ferguson spoke highly of striker Robin van Persie, signed from Arsenal last summer.

'He certainly is magnificent players. He brings maturity, he is a proven goalscorer, a proven international and and is at a good age. He is helping our young strikers, Chicharito and Danny Welbeck. He's been outstanding since he came.'

He also welcomed the return of Nemanja Vidic. 'He has been out for a year and three months, although he has played a few games. He's our captain, a real warrior and our leader.'

And he was asked if United could win the league and European Cup double, a feat they managed in both 1999 and 2008. 'It's hard to marry the two together,' he replied. 'We've done it in the past and there is no reason why we can't do it this season too.'

He was critical of United's success in Europe, however, and believes they should have won more than the two European Cups in his time as manager.

'I think our club should have done better. Sometimes we have been unlucky, sometimes we have been disappointing and other times, we have thrown it away.'

Ferguson also praised his wife Kathy, to whom he has been married for 47 years. 'Without her backing and support, there is no way I'd have lasted as long as I have,' he said.

And when asked to decide who is the better player: Real Madrid forward Ronaldo or Barcelona's Messi, he replied: 'They are both the best in the world. They have different qualities, but they both have fantastic desire.

'Pride to play, pride to prepare. Ronaldo practiced for hours, that's what made him a great player. We had the privilege of him for six years and he will go down as one of the best players this club has ever had.'

Finally, the interviewer asks him if he would like to sign Balotelli for United from City. A smiling Fergie responds: 'I have enough players!'
