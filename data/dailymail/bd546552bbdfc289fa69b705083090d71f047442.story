President Barack Obama is kicking off the new year Hawaiian-style with beaches and sweet treats.

The First Family started 2015 with a snorkelling trip to  Hanauma Bay outside Honolulu which was closed to the public for four hours Thursday morning. 

Later, Obama and his daughter Malia stopped in nearby Kailua for shave ice, a Hawaiian treat similar to a snow cone.

Obama wore casual clothes for this visit to Island Snow, and ordered a shave ice with melon, cherry and lilikoi(passion fruit and guava) syrup.

The President visits the Kailua shave ice shop every year, and tends to order the same thing - a combination that has since become known as a Snowbama.

Obama, who was born in Honolulu, wished his fellow customers a 'Happy New Year' before heading back to his rented vacation home.

The Obamas finished the day by dining with friends at Vintage Cave in Waikiki. It's one of Honolulu's most exclusive restaurants where the average meal takes three hours.

The First Family arrived before Christmas and have been enjoying the holiday on the islands.

This weekend, President Obama surprised a wedding with a phonecall to the bride and the groom where he apologised for making them move their ceremony.

Natalie Heimel and Edward Mallue Jr.,both U.S. Army captains stationed in Hawaii, had planned to get married on the 16ht hole of Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.

The couple was told on Saturday they would have to have to move their wedding away from the hole because Obama and his friends planned to golf. 

The president called the newlyweds mid-wedding to apologize for disrupting their plans and offer his congratulations.

His annual two-week vacation in Hawaii wraps up this weekend.
