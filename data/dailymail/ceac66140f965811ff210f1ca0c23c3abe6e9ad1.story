The U.S. transport police have released a shocking list of weapons confiscated from passengers trying to board planes in the past year.

The deadly haul of weapons, from maces and fake suicide vests, to an assortment of concealed guns and knives, was listed in the annual review of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

Officers discovered the assortment of guns and knives as they screened 638,705,790 passengers at airports across the U.S.

Concealed: The TSA confiscated an average of five guns a day at airports across the U.S. last year

Sharp: A selection of ninja stars and other jagged objects taken from passengers in 2013

Unexpected: A bazooka round that was found inside a bag

Guns were the most frequently confiscated item, with 1,813 firearms - roughly five a day - found during passenger checks at 205 airports.

More worryingly, the TSA said that in about 80 per cent of cases, the guns were loaded.

The largest number were found at Atlanta's international airport, with Dallas/Fort Worth International coming in second, according to the Huffington Post.

In one case officers found a .380 pistol, loaded with eight rounds, that had been strapped to the lower leg of a passenger.

At Boston Logan airport, an alarm on a checked bag alerted officers to a disassembled 30-30 rifle concealed in the bag lining. When they ran checks on the serial number they discovered it had been stolen.

A shotgun was also found in a checked golf bag in Detroit, and seven undeclared firearms were found in a toolbox in Miami.

Concern: A suicide vest found in a checked bag. Officers discovered it was inactive and belonged to an explosives instructor

Stunned: This selection of stun and smoke grenades were also confiscated

Medieval: A wood and metal mace was found at a Chicago airport

As well as guns, passengers were also found to have stun guns, shock grenades, flare guns, inert demolition devices and, in one case, a Second World War bazooka, in their carry on bags.

At Chicago's Midway International, TSA officials even found a medieval wood and metal mace.

Often seemingly innocent looking items such as pens, combs and walking stalks were found to conceal an array of knives and swords.

And cigarette packets and lipsticks were used to try to conceal stun guns and pepper spray.

The discovery of a suicide vest shocked one group of officers. It was found to be deactivated and belonged to an explosives instructor.

No joke: Clockwise from top left, a bow, finger spikes, a bang stick, gun-shaped alarm clock, stun knuckles, a fake bomb and a BB machine gun were all confiscated

One of the most bizarre finds however, was fragments of a human skull that were discovered inside clay pots in a checked bag.

The owners of the pots said they had no idea the pieces of bone were inside. The discovery caused delays at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International in Florida as officers investigated.
