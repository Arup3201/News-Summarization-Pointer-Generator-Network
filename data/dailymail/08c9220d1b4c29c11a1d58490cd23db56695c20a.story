Arsenal are turning their attentions to securing the futures of their existing squad after their £80million summer splurge.

Olivier Giroud and Mikel Arteta are both in line for new contracts following the club’s costly spree on fresh talent, including Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck, this summer.

The news will come as a timely boost to Giroud after he was ruled out for four months with a broken ankle.

Giroud’s contract expires in 2016, but the Gunners are keen to end any uncertainty over the striker’s future by extending his deal until 2018.

The club will also look to tie captain Arteta down to a 12-month deal in the coming weeks.

Meanwhile, Arsenal are hopeful of having injured forward Theo Walcott available for the north London derby against Tottenham on September 27.
