The parents of a Washington state teenager who was paralyzed in a freak hunting accident are speaking out to say their son is making 'miraculous' progress by drinking on his own - something doctors said he would likely never do again.

But, Kevin Wayne Jr., 17, remains unable to move from the neck down after a tow rope that was pulling an elk snapped and hit him in the neck and severed his spine last month.

He can speak in deep, froggy growls, but has said little about the accident that has left him in a hospital bed.

'The only thing he has said is, "I should have stayed home that morning,"' Kevin's mother Aurea Gonzales told KOMO-TV.

The family is now raising money to help pay for Kevin's mounting medical bills with a Go Fund Me account.

Doctors fear the teen may never be able to walk again. His parents have quit their jobs to be by their son's bedside as he struggles recover.

His doctors also said he may never be able to eat on his own or breathe without a respirator, as well.

However, Ms Gonzales revealed that on Wednesday he sipped a smoothie.

'Miracles do happen and he's gonna show everybody wrong,' his mother said.Â 

The tragedy took place on October 18 while Kevin was out hunting with a group of friends near Greenwater, Oregon.

Wayne Jr. was airlifted to Harborview
 Medical Center for treatment. He has undergone surgery on his neck and 
has shown the first sign of improvement - being able to move his arm.

The family, who have no health insurance, are fundraising to pay for the teenager's medical bills

Family member Teresa Gonzales said his parents didn't have jobs that provided health care benefits.

Teresa has started a donation page on the GoFundMe website.

In
 her appeal for donations she wrote: 'On Friday, October 18, my grand 
nephew, Kevin Wayne, Jr. was injured in a freak accident that left him 
paralyzed from the neck down and breathing with the help of a 
ventilator.

'October 24th was his 17th birthday. His parents are by his side 24/7 and both have had to leave their jobs.

'My
 niece and her partner, the mother and father, need financial assistance
 to get through this immediate crisis until a longer-term funding source
 can be established.

'Friends
 and family are exhausting their own resources to pay for gas, parking, 
food, etc. Any and all financial help is welcome.'

After several people made online donations she added: 'We are overwhelmed with your generosity.

'This
 is a sad and difficult time for us but your warmth and thoughtfulness 
is giving us the strength we need to carry on. This will be a long and 
difficult road.'
