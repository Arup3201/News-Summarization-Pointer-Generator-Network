Most brides would expect the earth to move on their wedding day - but not literally.

TV reporter Chen Ying was just about to take her nuptials when a massive earthquake, which has so for far claimed more than 150 lives, struck in southern China.

But instead of panicking, her journalistic instincts kicked in and she got straight to work on reporting from the scene.

With no time to ditch her bridal gown and veil, the intrepid reporter grabbed a mic and began describing the scene in the province of Sichuan.

The footage of her extraordinary dedication has gone viral on the Chinese social networking site, Weibo, where users are praising her professional spirit.

More than 5,500 people are reported to have been injured in the earthquake which struck mountainous Lushan county shortly after 8am this morning local time, and 19 people have been reported missing in the wake of the tremor.

Destruction: A giant rock blocks the road about 20 kilometers from Lushan in Ya'an city

The earthquake, while not as destructive as the one in 2008, toppled buildings, triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in the region.

The quake - measured by the earthquake administration at magnitude-7.0 and by the U.S. Geological Survey at 6.6 - struck the steep hills of Lushan county shortly after 8 a.m., when many people were at home, sleeping or having breakfast.
