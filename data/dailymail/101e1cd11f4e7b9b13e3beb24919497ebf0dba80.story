Daniel Sturridge took to Twitter to vent his frustration after Liverpool's 3-0 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford while assuring his fans that he is fighting to get back to full fitness 

The 25-year-old has not played for Liverpool since August 31 after he initially strained a thigh while on international duty with England.

On the eve of his Reds comeback he pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session with the first team.

And just when Sturridge thought he would be back in action, he sustained another thigh injury which has ruled him out until the new year.

Liverpool sorely missed Sturridge's influence at Old Trafford as Brendan Rodgers deployed Raheem Sterling as a makeshift frontman. 

Sterling's finishing prowess was lacking as the Reds forward failed to capitalise on a number of clear cut chances in front of goal in the first half.

Mario Balotelli entered the fray after the break but the Italian striker also failed to beat the outstanding David De Gea. 

Liverpool's profligacy in front of goal was cruelly exposed by the home side as Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie all found the back of the net for a rampant United.
