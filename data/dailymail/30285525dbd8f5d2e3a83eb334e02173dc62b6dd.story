Michael Phelps ended a months-long streak of social media silence that followed a rehab stint after a September DUI arrest with a photo that featured him and an old flame.

The 29-year-old Olympian snapped a Thanksgiving dinner table family selfie on Thursday after two-months in recovery and included in the shot was none other than Miss California 2010 Nicole Johnson.

The two have dated on-and-off going all the way back to 2007. They've reportedly been an item once again for weeks. 

Back at home: Recently out of a rehab stint that followed a September 30 DUI arrest, Michael Phelps has broken months of social media silence with a family Thanksgiving selfie that also includes his on-and-off girlfriend and former Miss California, Nicole Johnson

'Out with my grizzlyman': Johnson also posted shots of herself with the scruffy-looking Olympian

Phelps, the winner of a world record 22 Olympic medals, had been totally silent on his social media since taking to Twitter on October 5 to apologize for his September 30 DUI arrest in Baltimore.

While he remained silent, rumors swirled that he'd just begun dating a woman named Taylor Lianne Chandler just before his arrest.

That self-proclaimed girlfriend claimed the two had met on Tinder and that Phelps is the one who pursued her.

The buxom, blond 41-year-old then announced that she'd been born neither a man nor a woman, but intersex.

‘He pursued me [on Tinder],' Chandler told the Daily Beast. 'It felt real with him. I’ve been to his house four times, we talk everyday, and I’ve slept with him more than once.’

Johnson also posted this photo with Phelps and his family during Thanksgiving festivities

While Phelps remained silent and in rehab, rumors swirled he'd been dating this woman--41-year-old Taylor Lianne Chandler--just prior to his DUI arrest. Chandler made headlines when she claimed she was Phelps' lover and that she was born intersex

Phelps has not responded to Chandler's claims, but his re-emergence from rehab with Ms. Johnson at his side appears to be as good a response as any to the rumors.

He and Johnson dated for three years up until a 2012 breakup, according to the Washington Post.

According to TMZ, they are officially back on and went on a date to a movie last week.

Also last week, the swimmer returned to training according to one of the Olympian's trainers.

'Michael is in Baltimore, happily back in the pool, working toward his goals for next year,' Keenan Robinson, director of athlete services at North Baltimore Aquatic Club, announced last Monday while accepting an award on behalf of Phelps, who was suspended for six months by USA Swimming following the September 30 DUI arrest, which was his second.
