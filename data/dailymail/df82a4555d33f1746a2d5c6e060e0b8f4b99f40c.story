Children were told to line up according to their skin colour as part of a primary school lesson – with one boy later picked on because he was said to be the 'blackest'.

Teachers at the school in South-East London told a class of around 30 children to 'organise themselves from the darkest to the lightest'.

The year six children are aged between ten and 11 and school bosses said the exercise which took place last Wednesday helped them learn about ethnic diversity.

Teachers at Ryelands Primary School in South Norwood, south London, told a class to 'line up according to their skin colour'

Parents said they were shocked when their children came home and told them about that day's lessons.

They criticised the exercise as 'highly inappropriate' and said one pupil ended up being picked on because of his skin colour.

One
 child's mother, who asked not to be named, said: 'Parents have told me 
children laughed at one child because he was “the blackest” and argued 
about who was darker and who was lighter.

'This
 is not something that you want to be happening in your school. I would 
be mortified if it was my child. I think it is highly inappropriate. 
Parents have complained but the school did not apologise for it, they 
tried to explain it away.'

Ryelands
 Primary School in South Norwood was inspected by Ofsted in February and
 placed in special measures after being rated as inadequate.

It
 was taken over by Oasis Community Learning and last Thursday became an 
academy. Another parent, who asked not to be named, said: 'How can they 
think lining up children according to their skin colour is educational?

Ofsted inspected the school in February this year and it was rated 'inadequate' and placed in special measures

'This
 is totally ridiculous and I am ashamed to say my child is in this 
school – I'm only glad my son only has another year to go before he can 
move to another school.'

Oasis
 Community Learning defended the lesson, saying it was designed to 
prepare children for secondary school by encouraging them to talk about 
'ethnic diversity'.

A 
spokesman said: 'Inclusion is our raison d'etre and we are very 
committed to equality. In this instance, it was about celebrated 
differences and saying it is OK to talk about them in a positive way but
 recognising we are all the same underneath.

'We
 fully support the teaching assistants that were involved but of course 
we are always willing to listen to feedback about how we do things in 
the future.'

The school's 
website states that it 'aspires to treat everyone inclusively and 
recognises the importance of a holistic approach  to education'.

Its
 'vision and values statement' says: 'At Ryelands we aim for all our 
children to achieve their best in a safe and stimulating environment.

'The
 Ryelands learning community also aims to develop and encourage mutual 
respect, self confidence, co-operation and self-motivation.

'We
 encourage our children to be enthusiastic and independent learners who 
engage in the world around them with enquiring minds and compassionate 
hearts.'

As well as that, 
the school says that it aims to 'foster respect, tolerance and love for 
others, regardless of race, gender, religion or difference, within a 
framework of equality of opportunity and fairness'.

It
 also says it wishes to 'promote a feeling of pride and confidence in 
learners' identities; as individuals, as members of our academy, as part
 of the local community and as citizens of the world'.
