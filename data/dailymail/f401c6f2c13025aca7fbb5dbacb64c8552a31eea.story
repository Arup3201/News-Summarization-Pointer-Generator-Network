A 33-year-old former English teacher from Montclair, New Jersey pleaded guilty Tuesday morning to endangering the welfare of a child after admitting she had sexual relations with a 15-year-old male student.

Erica DePalo, who taught at West Orange High School, will receive life parole supervision under the terms of the plea agreement when she is sentenced April 29.

She must forfeit her teaching license, undergo a psychological evaluation and never seek government employment. DePalo also must register as a sex offender under Megan's Law and cannot have contact with the victim.

DePalo was initially charged with aggravated sexual assault and a second count of sexual assault since the student was 15 and could not consent. Those charges were dropped as part of the agreement.

She could have faced up to 10 years in prison if convicted on all initial charges.

DePalo appeared in court dressed in a gray pencil skirt and suit jacket with her brown hair pulled tightly back in a bun. She told Judge Peter Ryan that on June 27, 2012 she had sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old boy, who was also her student, who had came to her apartment after school.

As she left the courtroom with her attorney, Anthony Alfano, DePalo declined to comment and wiped tears from her eyes.

Assistant Prosecutor Tony Gutierrez said he spoke with the boy's father and the family was happy with the deal.

Gutierrez said text messages between the two ‘made it clear they were in something of a relationship,’ reports NJ.com.

Prosecutors have said the relationship was the only one DePalo had with a minor and that it lasted from June 15 until Aug. 28.

The plea came early, before the case was heard by the grand jury. ‘It's 
fair to say everybody wanted to get this over and done with,’ Gutierrez 
said.

DePalo had been a teacher for nearly a decade and a career high point 
came when she was named Essex County's teacher of the year in 2011 for 
her work with freshmen and sophomores.

She taught honors English, creative writing, college prep and journalism and coached junior varsity girls tennis.

The single woman had been held at a northern New Jersey lock-up in lieu of $100,000 bail.

'I don’t have any children,' DePalo remarked after winning her award, 
'and I always say that I don’t have any children to go home and take 
care of.

'But every morning and every day that I go to school I have 110 children that are very near-and-dear to my heart.'

She graduated from Villanova University - a Roman-Catholic college in 
Philadelphia - with an English degree, before continuing her studies at 
New York University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where she 
earned her master's in Liberal Studies.
