This whole World Cup looked like it was set up for Wayne Rooney to become the scapegoat. But he answered his critics with a fine performance against Uruguay. He was our silver lining.

Roy Hodgson said the nation had an obssession with Rooney, but he fuelled it by sticking him out on the left wing for the Italy game after two years of playing him through the middle.

My best manager

Terry Venables. An innovator, a coach who would switch tactics and change it around. The players loved playing for him. England have spent 20 years trying to find someone like him — and haven’t.

My favourite momentGazza’s goal against Scotland in Euro 96. I was on the pitch with him, joined in the Dentist Chair celebration… the goal was genius and the celebration was fun.

My favourite playerPaul Gascoigne. The Dutch man-marked him at Italia 90. The Dutch! Shows you how good he was.

Strikers are sensitive types and if you doubt them, you’ve lost them.

Playing on the wing would have been a kick in the teeth for Rooney, but he picked himself up and delivered when the whole country was waiting for him to fail.

He put in a shift, worked hard and was unlucky not to have a hat-trick.

He was England’s most dangerous player. Diego Costa is being sold to Chelsea for £30million and looked half the player Rooney did.

Imagine the hounding he would have received if he had done what Daniel Sturridge did: come off with a dead leg against Italy with England losing — then start the next game a few days later.

Instead, Rooney got on with his job. There’s no point comparing him to Luis Suarez — who is a freak of nature — but we should cherish him.
