A girl has been banned from wearing a wristband to support injured soldiers because her school deems it a health and safety risk.

Ellie Sandywell wears the Help for Heroes band in honour of her cousin and brother, who are both in the military.

But teachers confiscated it because they said she might injure herself by getting the wristband caught on a door handle.

Now University Primary Academy, in Stoke-on-Trent, has sent a letter to the parents of every pupil warning them that charity wristbands may not be worn with school uniform.

11-year-old Ellie decided to start wearing the wristband, which raises money for injured troops, to support her cousin Ethan Millard, 17, who serves in the RAF, and her brother Joshua, 20, who is training to join the Royal Marines.

'I was given a choice of handing over my band or getting a red letter, which is something you get for bad behaviour,' she said.

'I was told off in front of all the class and I just wish I could have been quietly spoken to about it and I could have explained that I wear it in support of my cousin and brother. I am still going to wear it because it is a cause close to my heart.'

Her mother Elizabeth Hassall, 41, from Kidsgrove in Staffordshire, said that banning the wristband was like stopping pupils from wearing a poppy on Remembrance Sunday.

Charity: Proceeds from the sale of the Help for Heroes wristband go to help wounded troops

'I know that things like earrings and nail varnish are not part of the uniform, but I think a charity wristband is a bit different,' she said.

'I went into school and spoke to the teacher about it, and was told they would continue to confiscate it because she's breaking health and safety rules.

'I was stunned when they sent a newsletter to all parents on Thursday saying that they could get them snared of door handles and get injured.

'They are made of rubber, in all likelihood they would snap if that happened. And what about watches and blazers that can get caught on things - are they going to ban them now?

'In my eyes, wearing a wristband is exactly the same as wearing a poppy, so what are they going to do when it comes to Remembrance Day?

'I can't remember a day where Ellie hasn't worn her wristband and I think it's quite nice that she's so young and understands the importance of wearing it all the time.'

School: Ellie is a pupil at University Primary Academy in Stoke-on-Trent

Letter: The school wrote to all parents warning them not to allow children to wear wristbands to class

Another parent at the school, who did not want to be named, added: 'To ban a charity wristband is wrong anyway - but banning them because they are dangerous is just ludicrous.'

Headteacher Sara Stevenson said that only the official school uniform could be worn due to safety concerns.

'While the Academy fully supports many charities, we also have to maintain high standards in health and safety and in presentation,' she said.

'Rubber and plastic wristbands are not permitted in school because, not only do they not form part of our school uniform, but if they were to get caught on items such as door handles they may cause injury.

'Pupils are allowed to attach their wristbands or other decorations to school bags to show their support for their chosen charities. Any wrist bands worn at school will be kept safe by the class teacher until the end of the school day.'

Last month the school became an academy for 202 pupils between the ages of four and eleven after the University of Chester Academies Trust took over failing Maryhill Primary School, which was placed into special measures by Ofsted in June last year.
