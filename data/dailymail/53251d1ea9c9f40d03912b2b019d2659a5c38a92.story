A female military police officer is being hailed a hero after she bravely approached the Fort Hood gunman who had just killed three people and injured 16 more in a horror shooting spree.

The cop, who has not yet been identified, risked her life to ensure Iraq war veteran Ivan Lopez, 34, didn't harm anyone else Wednesday afternoon.

'It was clearly heroic what she did,' Lt Gen. Mark A. Milley, the commanding general of the military base, told reporters in a press conference Wednesday night.

'She did her job and she did exactly what we would expect from a US military police,' he added.

Milley said shots rang out at the Killeen, Texas, post around 4p.m. local time and that military police responded within 15 minutes.

Hero: Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, commanding general of III Corps and Fort Hood, described how a brave military police officer risked her life to stop the gunman at a press conference Wednesday

Police: The unidentified female cop was among law enforcement, pictured, who approached a building at Fort Hood where a shooting was reported

He said Lopez entered one building and fired shots at individuals then returned to a vehicle before entering a second building to fire more shots.

He finally turned his weapon, a .45 caliber Smith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol, on himself, after the officer confronted him in the parking lot.

Milley said: 'He was approaching (the officer) at 20 feet, put his hands up and then reached under his jacket and pulled out the .45 caliber, she engaged and he put the gun to his head' and killed himself.

His body was found in the parking lot where he was engaged by the officer.

A female cop was also responsible for stopping the Fort Hood gunman who in 2009 killed 13 people in what was the deadliest attack on a domestic military base in U.S. history.

Kimberly Munley arrived quickly on the scene of the shooting, confronted the shooter Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan and shot him four times. Munley, the then 34-year-old mother-of-one, was wounded in the exchange but recovered.

The heroic story comes after 
President Barack Obama vowed that investigators would 'get to the 
bottom' of Wednesday's Fort Hood shooting and tried to reassure the 
nation after the attack that left at least four dead.

Obama
 said he and his team were closely monitoring the situation, and said 
details about the attack on the large Army base were still not clear.

He
 added that the shooting had brought back painful memories of the 2009 
massacre, which in addition to killing 13, saw another 30 injured.

'We're heartbroken that something like this might have happened again,' Obama said.

As
 he offered thoughts and prayers to the Texas community, the President 
pledged to do everything possible to ensure Fort Hood had everything it 
needed to deal with the investigation.

Standing
 in front of a black curtain, with an American flag nearby, Obama 
reflected on the sacrifices that troops stationed at Fort Hood have 
made, including multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

'Painful memories': Barack Obama vowed that investigators will get to the bottom of the shooting

Heartbroken: 'They serve with valor, they serve with distinction and when they're at their home base, they need to feel safe,' Obama said

'They serve with valor, they serve with distinction and when they're at their home base, they need to feel safe,' Obama said.

'We don't yet know what happened tonight, but obviously that sense of safety has been broken once again.'

He added: 'Obviously this reopens the pain of what happened at Fort Hood five years ago.'

Obama's comments came as officials said four people were dead and 16 had been wounded at the Army base.

A
 military official confirmed the shooter, a soldier identified by local 
representative Michael McCaul as 34-year-old Ivan Lopez, shot himself 
dead at the base.

The shooter is one of the four reported deaths and was being assessed for PTSD.

A Fort Hood Official said the attack was not related to terrorism.

On
 November 5, 2009, Major Nidal Hasan opened fire in a processing center 
for soldiers returning from or leaving for active duty. 

His attack killed 13 people, including a pregnant soldier, and injured more than 30.

Hasan's deadly rampage ended when military police shot him, paralyzing the Army Major, who is Muslim, from the waist down.

Hasan, who was 40 at the time of his attack, had been raised in Virginia and joined the Army after high school.

He regularly treated soldiers returning from war zones and was believed to have been unhappy about an upcoming deployment.

Hasan used two handguns in the 10-minute attack and fired 146 bullets.

He told a military court he carried out the shootings to protect Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.

Last
 August he was sentenced to death after being found guilty of 13 counts 
of premeditated murder, and 32 counts of attempted murder.

The shooter used a .45 semi-automatic pistol in the shooting, which took place around the medical barracks. He also used it to take his own life.

The injured were taken to Darnall Army Community Hospital at Fort Hood and other local hospitals.

Dr Glen Couchman, chief medical officer at Scott and White Hospital in Temple, said the first four people admitted there had gunshots to chest, abdomen, neck and extremities and that their conditions range from stable to 'quite critical'.

A witness told News 10 that about 20 shots were fired in a post motor pool in the area of Motor Pool Road and Tank Destroyer Boulevard.

The witness said he saw at least three people struck by bullets, and all three were taken to hospital.

The base was put on lock down, with those on it ordered to stay away from windows and doors.

Family members of soldiers based at Fort Hood were seen trying to reach their loved ones by cell phones as they waited for news.

The President was informed of the incident while he was at a steakhouse for a Democratic National Committee fundraiser.

He
 addressed the nation without notes or prepared remarks in the same room
 of the Chicago restaurant where he had just met with about 25 donors.

White House officials quickly pushed tables to the side of the room to make room for Obama to speak to the nation.

The President, who said 'any shooting is trouble,' returned to the White House later on Wednesday evening.

On November 5, 2009, Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and injured 
dozens more.

Hasan, who
 became a radical Muslim while serving in the U.S. forces, is currently 
on military death row. He claimed his attack was revenge for the wars in
 Iraq and Afghanistan.
