The only works of art depicting the horrors of Auschwitz in occupied Poland - made by an inmate and hidden in a bottle - have gone on display for the first time at the camp's museum.

Children can be seen being torn from the arms of their mothers and a guard smoking a cigarette outside a gas chamber as bodies are loaded into a lorry are among the artworks on show.

They were made in secret - their discovery at the time would have meant instant execution for the artist - and hidden in a bottle that was then stashed into the eaves of one of the huts.

Horror: The 'Sketchbook from Auschwitz' contains drawings of the selection process Nazi soldiers employed on Jewish prisoners at the concentration camp - including this one showing a little boy being taken from his family

Unique: A German soldier smokes a cigarette in front of a gas chamber as bodies are loaded on to a truck nearby. The drawings were hidden inside a bottle in the eaves of one of the huts used to house Jewish people

Agnieszka Sieradzka, Auschwitz art historian, said: 'You can clearly see that the author was determined in presenting the largest number of details.

'Badges of functionary prisoners, number plates of trucks, train cars on the ramp as well as block numbers are carefully depicted.

'The author of the sketchbook hoped that someone would find his work so that it would become a witness to extermination.'

Auschwitz, not far from the Polish city of Krakow, was the biggest extermination facility operated by the SS during the Second World War. 

Some 1.2 million of the six million victims of the Nazi genocide programme were killed there.

A former prisoner working as a watchman discovered the 32 sketches in a bottle near the death camp's crematorium in 1947.

Holocaust: This image depicts hundreds of Jewish families as they are taken off a train at the concentration camp. The drawings were created before 1943, but the artist is only known as MM

Terror: In this image, a pajama-wearing man offers a book towards a Nazi guard as lines of prisoners look on

'The Sketchbook from Auschwitz' includes the 22 pages of drawings from an unknown prisoner whose initials were apparently MM. They represent a rare first-hand historical account of the Holocaust. 

'These sketches are the only work of art made in Birkenau that depict exterminations,' said museum spokesman Pawel Sawicki.

'The second wing of the main gate was built between 1943 and 1944, but is absent from the sketches. Thus we concluded that the sketches were drawn in 1943 or before.

'From our records we believe that the author would have worked in the hospital sector or gathering luggage from the ramp,' Mr Sawicki explained.

On display: The sketchbook is being shown for the first time at the museum at Auschwitz, in Poland. Right, the famous 'Work Makes You Free' on the main entrance of the death camp

The Polish-English publication was launched by the Auschwitz archives last week.

Auschwitz has 6,000 works of art in its archives relating to the horrors which took place there and many are due to go on display this year, the 70th anniversary of the start of the Holocaust.

The blueprints for the extermination programme were laid down on January 20, 1942 at the Wannsee Villa situated on the lake of the same name in Berlin.  

To mark the event this Friday in the German capital there are a number of cultural and memorial events including a gala concert and a moment of silence in the parliament.
