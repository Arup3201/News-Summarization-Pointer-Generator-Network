It's available in quilted, coloured and scented varieties, but the more refined sections of society are turning away from toilet paper in search of something softer.

The residents of Kensington and Chelsea are switching to wet wipes for that 'clean in between' feeling. But the fashion for these 'unflushables' is putting a strain on London's aging drains.

Now, water bosses have declared war on wet wipes in a bid to reduce their £12million annual bill for unblocking sewers.

'Wet wipes don’t break down like loo 
roll does, and can cause nasty blockages in our sewers', said Thames Water executive Nick Sumption.

UK sales of wet wipes are rising by 15per cent annually. And with a £1.99 pack of 42 wipes costing the same as 840 sheets of loo paper, it is a comfort confined to the upper crust.

Indeed, Mr Suption says: 'Because [wet wipes] are not cheap to buy, it may be more of a problem in places like Kensington and Chelsea.'

Thames Water spends £12 million on 
clearing about 80,000 blockages a year. It estimates three-quarters of 
these could be caused by wet wipes.

The company is urging people to use a new foam that is sprayed onto lavatory paper, and breaks down more easily than wet wipes.

It
 has teamed up with Gloucestershire-based company Freshu, whose 
antibacterial gel can be squirted into ordinary loo paper to make it 
feel just like a wet wipe - but with none of the sewer-blocking dangers

Money down the drain: Thames Water bosses say the wipes account for up to 75per cent of sewer blockages, costing up to £12m a year to fix

'We have to adapt to the changes in our customers’ behaviour', said Mr Sumption.

Every day, Thames Water supplies 2,600million litres of fresh water to 8.5million customers in Greater London and the Thames Valley.

But this operation is dwarfed by its 14million sewerage customers, who produce 4billion litres of waste water every day. Despite a number of major infrastructure projects, London's 150-year-old sewer system is struggling to cope with the volume.

The increase in waste wet wipes is compounding another big headache for Thames Water - fatty food. Fat can be poured down the plughole when warm but sets into hard 'fatbergs' when it cools down in the sewers. Wipes then stick to the congealed fat causing more serious blockages.

Freshu foam is the brainchild of Oxford University graduate Dr Daniel Darg, who came up with the idea in 2009 to moisten loo roll without it disintegrating.

'We are pleased to join Thames Water in the on-going battle against sewer abuse', he said.

The Boots website has everything you need to feel really 'clean in between'

Andrex Washlets toilet tissue wipes'Enriched with aloe to gently moisturise the skin' (£1.33)

Halo moist toilet tissue wipes'Fresh & gentle cleansing with a mild chamomile formula' (£1.09 for 10 wipes)

Kandoo sensitive wipes'Help your child master toilet time' (£2.03 for 50 wipes)

Boots moist toilet tissue'Leaves you feeling really fresh' (£1.09 for 40 wipes)

'If used at all pre-moistened wipes should be binned, not flushed, as per Thames Water’s 'Bin it - don’t block it' motto.

'However, with a bottle of Freshu on hand, why would you need to? A squirt of Freshu gives toilet roll all the cleansing power of a wipe but with none of the sewer-blocking risk.'

A spokesman for Andrex said: 'As the UK’s leading toilet tissue brand we take the issue of flushability and the environment very seriously. Our Washlets toilet tissue wipes are flushable, biodegradable and are thoroughly tested...We have also worked with the water waste industry in the UK to understand flushability and sustainability issues.

'Ultimately, we strive to ensure that all of our toilet tissue products adhere to industry standards, are clearly labelled and utilised in the most environmentally friendly way

Thames Water acquired 60% more sewers on
 October 1 2011 following a law change that transferred ownership of 
privately-owned sections of sewer to water companies.
