Alexandra Carter, who is blind, feels passport officials discriminated against her because her eyes weren't focused in her application picture after they rejected it because of her non neutral expression

A blind woman claims she was refused a passport because her eyes were out of focus in her picture.

Alexandra Carter, of Wigan in Lancashire, said she feels discriminated against after Passport Officials rejected her application because they said she did not have a 'neutral expression.' 

The 25-year-old said she feels her application was refused because her eyes were not focused in the picture due to a condition she has had since birth which makes her unable to move them herself.

However officials have disputed her claims, and said the application was rejected because of her expression. 

Miss Carter has had to provide letters from her doctor proving her eyesight problems in order to have her application accepted. 

'I feel disgusted,' said Miss Carter. 

'I am a registered blind girl who was refused a passport because my eyes were not correct.

'I have nystagmus from birth which controls the movement of my eyes. It is impossible for me to take a picture where my eyes are focused.

'Within the application there was no box to tick about my disability. 

'I rang up to see if I needed to do anything to prove my disability and was told no. I even went to the Post Office to explain my situation and I was told that as long as the photo met the other requirements specified it should be fine.'

Nystagmus is an involuntary eye movement condition, which can cause reduced or limited vision. It occurs in infancy or in later life. 

But officials at the Passport Office in Liverpool in Merseyside rejected her initial application because of Miss Carter's expression in the photograph she provided. 

She has spent around £25 trying to get the photo right and had feared she was not going to be able to go on holiday with a friend to Santa Ponsa in Majorca - her first overseas holiday in 10 years.  

Miss Carter, 25, was born with nystagmus - a condition which means she can't focus her eyes independently

'I have now had to write a letter explaining my disability as well as proof from my doctor and see if they will grant me a passport. I have taken new photos, but they are not much better - my eyes are beyond my control,' added Miss Carter.

'This matter is disgusting and discrimination against people who have eyesight problems. I should not have to explain a disability from birth to anyone.

'I live independently and don't need any help from anyone. I use a symbol cane to get around.

'It is something beyond my control and I just hoped they would be more understanding. I found I was treated with a lack of manners.'

Miss Carter said she was concerned she would lose the £400 she had already spent on the much anticipated holiday with her childhood friend. 

Miss Carter was concerned she would not be able to go on holiday after her first application was rejected 

The 25-year-old has had to write letters to officials and get a doctor's note to confirm her eye condition 

'I don't want in 10 years time when I re-apply for my passport to have to go through all this again.'

Passport Office officials have now confirmed that her passport has now been sent out.

A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The letter sent to Miss Carter to explain why her application was refused stated the photo she had submitted was unacceptable because she did not have a neutral expression.

'This was not related to her visual impairment and, following her complaint, staff from Her Majesty's Passport Office have spoken to her to clarify this.'

The rules about passport photos are particularly strict and include that the picture must have been taken in the last month and must not be cut down from a larger photograph.
