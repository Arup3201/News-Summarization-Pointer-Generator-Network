The world's largest wine tasting competition returns to the UK this summer, and it is women who are expected to crack open the Champagne.

The Palate contest, launched by wine merchant - Oddbins, has announced it's annual search for the UK's best amateur wine taster and is expecting to see more entries than ever before with 25,000 entrants anticipated.

The last few years have seen a succession of women sip their way to victory with the past two winners being female.

But it is not just The Palate that is seeing women take the wine-world by storm, a highly prestigious title, Master of Wine is seeing more and more of a female influence too.

Ana Sapungiu is soon to become one of the less than three hundred Masters of Wine worldwide and will be one of the younger ones in the UK. She agrees that when it comes to wine, she is seeing far more of a women's touch.

'I think the industry probably is more male 
dominated, however recent movements have seen women with more dominant 
roles. Traditionally women have been less confident in the industry but 
they have more confidence nowadays.'

Ana gives you the low-down on how the oh-so-sophisticated yet surprisingly simple art of wine tasting.

'My first most important tip would be to 
surround yourself with friends, it makes it less complicated and more 
fun.

'Go for one that's a bit different.

'Look at the colour if it is pale 
it will be a lighter drink and if it's darker it will tend to be 
heavier.

'Smell it, if it's fresh and vibrant it will have a lighter 
taste if it smells spicy it might be more concentrated and richer in 
flavour.

'Take a good sip, not a gulp but a good sip and try and draw 
some air through it to open up its flavours.

'Now swallow, there is no 
point in spitting unless it tastes horrible!

'See how long the taste 
stays, if it's two seconds it is probably not a very good wine, if it's 
around twenty then it is a much greater quality.'

Ana says, despite the fact the past three winners of The Palate have been women, she doesn't necessarily think that women are better wine tasters as such, but she agrees that they are an equal match for men.

'What I would say is that our last two 
winners of the Palette competition have been women, so they are at least
 as good as men, but none is better than the other. It is just amazing 
to see so many women engaging in the wine industry.'

With over ten years experience in the industry, does Ana have any advice on what makes a good wine taster?

'You have to
 have a mixed knowledge and to know all aspects but it is also about 
being able to communicate clearly and actively with people about the 
wine, it's a pursuit of knowledge.

'What
 I always tell my customers is if you like the wine then it's a good 
wine! There are a few faulty wines out there and you can tell if they 
are if they smell musky or unfresh.'

Even with this advice on board, contestants must ready themselves for some tough competition with only 64 of 25,000 entrants making it through to the semi-finals.

The competition starts in 35 individual Oddbins branches before the semi-finals that will take place in London this June.

The semi-finalists will enjoy the priceless opportunity to learn from one of four renowned wine experts in the UK at a 'boot camp', where their taste-buds will be out to the test by the best in the business.

Last year's judges Peter Richards and Susie Barrie, both Masters of Wine, will be joined this year by writers Sarah Ahmed and Joe Wadsack. Each judge will host their own boot camp for 16 semi-finalists before selecting just four participants each to go forward to the grand final in September.

The overall winner of The Palate 2014 will walk away with a trip for two people to Australia to visit some of the finest vineyards in the country.

Ayo Akintola, Managing Director of Oddbins, said that despite the fierce competition, they are trying to take away stuffy stereotypes that often come with wine tasting.

'We are committed to making wine appreciation as unstuffy, approachable and democratic as possible.

'Last year's finalists, most of whom were incredibly surprised to discover they had a talent for wine appreciation, came from a very diverse range of backgrounds.

'The format this year introduces some fun rivalry between four of the UK's leading wine experts, who will be tasked with preparing their boot camp winners for the rigours of the grand final.'

Susie Barrie, says the competition has the same talent scouting aspects as popular reality TV.

'The Palate is wine's answer to The Voice. It's a brilliant way for everyone in the country to give wine tasting a go and discover just how good their own palate is. The idea is to be challenged, have fun and not feel intimidated by wine, and we can all raise a glass to that!'
