Benefits? Jerry Sandusky may be able to continue collecting his pension while behind bars

Disgraced former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky may be able to hang on to his tax-payer funded pension, despite his conviction on dozens of child sex charges.

Sandusky reportedly rakes in about $59,000 in pension funds annually - on top of a $148,000 lump-sum payment he received when he retired from Penn State in 1999.

Under Pennsylvania's Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act, a retiree would have to forfeit their pension funds if they were convicted of offenses like theft, obstruction of justice or perjury.

However, molestation and child sexual abuse, which Sandusky has been convicted of, are not among them.

A spokeswoman for the State Employees' 
Retirement System said on Wednesday that the agency doesn't speculate 
about potential future actions under the Public Employee Pension 
Forfeiture Act.

But Nicholas Maiale, chairman of SERS, told the Patriot-News that he is looking to pursue a legal review of the boardâ€™s options for Sandusky's pension.

He told the paper: 'I am a Penn Stater and I am a citizen of Pennsylvania, and we are all morally outraged about this case and what happened to those kids.'

However, Maiale told the paper he's 'not optimistic' that the board can do anything about it

A pension system document says forfeiture can also occur when a school employee commits certain sex offenses against a student.

Also on Thursday, the Philadelphia Daily News reported that the taxpayers have underwritten an estimated $1.4million in funds for The Second Mile, Sandusky's charity for troubled youth.

Although it has been revealed that Sandusky met his victims through the charity, The Second Mile has continued to collect Pennsylvania-sponsored donations totalling up to $122,861 in the current fiscal year, according to the paper.

Sandusky was returned to the Centre County Correctional Facility last week he was convicted of 45 out of 48 charges of child sex abuse.

Guilty: Jerry Sandusky leaves court in handcuffs after being convicted of sexual assault last Friday

He faces 442 years in prison at his sentencing, which will take place sometime within the next three months.

After the verdict, Sandusky's lawyers said they tried to throw in the towel as the trial began because they had too little time to prepare.

Experts have said the seven months between Sandusky's November arrest and trial was fast-paced by Pennsylvania standards.

Joe
Amendola, Sandusky's lawyer, told The Associated Press: 'We told the 
trial court, the Superior Court and the Supreme Court we were not 
prepared to proceed to trial in June due to numerous issues, and we 
asked to withdraw from the case for those reasons.'

Calm: Sandusky showed few signs of emotion as the verdict was read out in court on Friday night

The
issues included a scheduling conflict with a defence team member and 
the need to read a cache of documents produced by a lengthy grand jury 
investigation.

Judge John Cleland denied their request.

The attorneys raised other issues that 
could be part of the future appeal, saying a mistrial was sought and 
denied over a repetition at trial of a brief part of a November 
interview Sandusky had with NBC's Bob Costas.

Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 45 of 
48 counts of child sexual abuse on Friday night after 21 hours of jury 
deliberations. He will likely die in prison.

Amendola spoke out as one of the 
jurors in the case said he was swayed by the 'very convincing' testimony
of eight accusers who said Sandusky molested them for years.

Shocking claim: On Thursday night, adopted son Matt Sandusky, seen here at court on June 22, claimed he had been abused by Jerry Sandusky

In custody: Sandusky's attorneys have indicated that they will appeal his conviction

In addition, Sandusky's adopted son came
forward to accuse the disgraced coach of abusing him when he was 
between the ages of 8 and 15 - just as jurors were deliberating.

Matt Sandusky, now 33, was to take the stand during the trial as a 'rebuttal witness' if Jerry Sandusky testified.

Jerry Sandusky's lawyers ultimately decided the 68-year-old former coach wouldn't speak in his own defence.

Prosecutors say Sandusky met the 10 sex-abuse victims through his charity, The Second Mile, which the coach established in 1977.

Experts have said the seven months between Sandusky's November arrest and trial was fast-paced by Pennsylvania standards.

Joe Amendola, Sandusky's lawyer, told The Associated Press: 'We told the trial court, the Superior Court and the Supreme Court we were not prepared to proceed to trial in June due to numerous issues, and we asked to withdraw from the case for those reasons.'

The issues included a scheduling conflict with a defence team member and the need to read a cache of documents produced by a lengthy grand jury investigation.

Judge John Cleland denied their request.

Almost immediately after the verdict, Penn State President Rodney Erickson signalled an openness to quickly settle potential civil lawsuits arising from the convictions, saying the school 'wants to provide a forum where the university can privately, expeditiously and fairly address the victims' concerns and compensate them for claims.'

The university recently reported a $1.8billion endowment.

Jailed: The former coach's bail was revoked immediately after the verdict was announced

The conviction of Sandusky brought an end to a horrific saga which has trashed the reputation of a 
leading public university - as well as its storied football programme - and ended the career of its president as well 
as its legendary head coach, Joe Paterno, who died of cancer in January.

After
the verdict was announced in the courtroom in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania,
Sandusky's bail was revoked and he was taken to the Center County 
Correctional Facility.

Sandusky
showed little emotion as the verdict was read. The judge ordered him to
be taken to the county jail to await sentencing in about three months.

In court, Sandusky half-waved toward 
family as the sheriff led him away. Outside, he calmly walked to a 
sheriff's car with his hands cuffed in front of him.
