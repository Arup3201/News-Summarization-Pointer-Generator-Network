Campaigners are pushing for chemical castration to be introduced as a way of treating sex offenders in the UK.

The medical treatment which decreases 
mens' sex drives using hormones, is already mandatory for child sex 
offenders in Poland, Russia and certain U.S. states.

The treatment is gaining popularity 
in Canada too, where Dr Paul Federoof, an expert in sexual behaviour who advocates it as a way to treat sex offenders, holds a clinic.

Today
as part of the This Morning's Crime Week hosts Holly Willoughby and 
Philip Schofield spoke to Dr Federoof and one of his patients 'Steve' 
(not his real name) who volunteered himself for chemical castration after 
his rape and murder fantasies started to become dangerous.

As part of their Crime Week programming This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby interviewed Dr Paul Federoof, an expert in sexual behaviour, and one of his patients 'Steve'

In his early twenties, Steve started to fantasise about raping and killing women. He would seek out women as he drove around in his car, and even planned the 'perfect crime'.

Fortunately his plan backfired and, so concerned was he that he was a risk to women, he sought help from Dr Fedoroff who put him on a programme of chemical castration, to decrease his sex drive.

Disguising his identity with a hooded jacket and speaking with his back to the camera Steve said: 'It started with me cheating on my then partner, this led to me looking online to meet people and everything progressed from there.

'The sex became more boring over time so I started looking for more extreme methods.

'I enjoyed the challenge of meeting someone online and seeing how fast I could get them in to bed.

'It progressed to being more violent and then the fantasies of sexual assault and rape started ... and then I thought of killing the women I was sleeping with.'

Talking about the night that his darkest fantasies almost became a reality Steve said: 'I went out that night to do it. I purchased specific tools and had them in the trunk of my car.

Chemical
castration involves a man taking hormones that suppress the production 
of testosterone, leading to a decreased sex drive.

Poland introduced mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders in 2009, it was introduced in South Korea in September and Russia and Moldova are following suit.

Both
Germany and the Czech Republic have been criticised by Europe's top 
human rights body for using voluntary surgical castration to treat sex 
offenders.

'I drove around and got an individual in to my car. It was easy, but I never harmed her.'

Steve's therapists believe that it was the fact that he started a conversation with the women that saved her life.

Steve, who had a girlfriend throughout the time, said: 'What I discovered with my therapist is that when it came to people that I knew I had no interest in assaulting or raping them. My girlfriend was never harmed.'

Steve volunteered himself to undergo chemical castration and counselling with Dr Feredoof and was assessed as being extremely dangerous according to the standard phallometric test.

Once he started the treatment he noticed results almost immediately. He said: 'The removal of my sex drive did occur quite rapidly and made me a lot more comfortable. I lost interest in acting out my thoughts, I had no sex for a year and a half.'

Dr Federoff said: 'It is certainly no quick fix, but almost every time we do this things turn out very well.'

Steve told Holly and Phillip that he noticed results almost immediately, he said: 'The removal of my sex drive did occur quite rapidly. I lost interest in acting out my thoughts.'
