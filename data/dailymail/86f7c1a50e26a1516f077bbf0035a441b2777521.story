Medals and world records may be the goal for all athletes, but a Brazilian sprinter has reminded the world that sometimes just finishing the race is a courageous achievement.

Yohannson Nascimento provided the Paralympics with one of its most poignant moments when after injuring himself during the men's T46 100m final he got up and hobbled over the finish line.

The runner was in the lead when he pulled up with a searing pain in his leg mid-way down the track and had to look on helplessly as his rivals raced away.

He collapsed to the floor, but Nascimento was not going to be beaten by a cruel injury at the worst possible moment.

Demonstrating the courage and determination of a true Paralympian he got up and limped slowly towards the finish.

He eventually crossed the line in 1.30.79 while Xu Zhao of China won the T46 race in 11.05 seconds.

The devastated athlete then sank to the ground and broke down in tears as the crowd of 80,000 cheered on his Herculean effort.

His desire to finish evoked memories of British 400m runner Derek Redmond's determination to complete the final in Barcelona after he pulled a hamstring after just 150m.

Redmond's will to cross the line after his father had fought past over-zealous officials to help him, is perhaps the most memorable moment of the Barcelona Games in 1992.

Earlier this summer in the London Olympics 110m hurdler Liu Xiang, the poster boy of the Chinese team, had given the Games its own enduring image after he collided with the first hurdle in a qualifying heat only to carry on and finish the race.

The injury agony was a sad echo of four years ago when Liu, who won gold in Athens in 2004, was denied the opportunity to repeat the feat in his home Games in Beijing four years later.

In the film Cool Runnings, based on a true story, the Jamaican bobsleigh team came from nowhere to compete at the Winter Olympics in Calgary in 1988.

For the first half of the final day's race it looked as though they would break the world bobsled speed record, but unfortunately their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flipped on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them metres short of the finish line.

However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish to rousing applause from spectators.

The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states they returned to Jamaica as heroes and at the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals.

In the same games Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards made the headlines as a gallant loser who overcame a series of injuries to take part in the ski jump despite having no chance of coming anywhere but last.

To the sounds of cheers the Jamaican bobsleigh team carry their sled across the finish line in the film Cool Runnings, based on the story of the 1988 Winter Olympics team
