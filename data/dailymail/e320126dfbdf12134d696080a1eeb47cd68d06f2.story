UFC fans might not consider themselves a squeamish crowd, but even they were shocked when a cage match had to be stopped after a fighter's ear exploded.

Leslie Smith was facing Jessica Eye at the UFC 180 in Mexico City, but the bout was ended in the second round after doctors were forced to intervene.

The 28-year-old Eye landed a right-hand punch straight on her opponent's cauliflower ear, causing it to explode and cover the unfortunate Smith in her own blood.

A video of the moment the ear blew up has been uploaded to the internet and has received nearly a million views so far.

Despite the shocking injury, the Bantamweight fighter from California said later that she had wanted to carry on. She revealed to MMA Fighting that she told the crowd in Spanish that she wasn’t hurt.

The 32-year-old said: ‘I could still see. I still had my hands. I wanted to fight. I’m disappointed. It wasn’t the way I wanted that fight to end. I wish my ear hadn’t done that. Man, that ear was a bummer.’

She explained that she had been draining the cauliflower ear every night and said that it now looked ‘pretty gnarly’.

Her opponent told Eurosport: ‘When I connected and saw her ear blow up, that became my main target. I was going to keep hitting it until they stopped the fight or it fell off.’
