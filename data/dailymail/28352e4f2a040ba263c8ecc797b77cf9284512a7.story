A huge landslide caused by melting snow has sparked a huge rescue operation over fears there are people trapped underneath tonnes of rubble.

The road connects much of Austria's Tyrol province with the city of Salzburg to the east, and emergency crews fear a car may be trapped under the rubble.

They say tons of soil and rock apparently loosened by melting snow rolled onto the two-lane roadway early Tuesday.

Police say a car from the capital, Vienna, was in the area at the time and was possibly buried by the slide.

Emergency team head Andreas Koell says search dogs are ready to look for possible victims as soon as geologists surveying the site from the air say it is safe to do so.

The latest landslide follows a spate of forest sliding down banks in January in the same region.

An unusual amount of rainfall has been blamed for causing a number of landslides in the central European country.

In Salzburg the rain-sodden mud caused part of forest to slip down a bank at the start of the year and crash on to a road below.

In
2010 a massive landslide in the same region left 35,000 cubic metres of
debris which workers struggled to clear, the Austrian times reported.

When slopes become saturated with water they may prompt a mud flow.

The slurry of rock and mud may be strong enough to uproot and carry trees, buildings and cars as it falls.

Emergency services said there is a chance that a car could be trapped beneath the road
