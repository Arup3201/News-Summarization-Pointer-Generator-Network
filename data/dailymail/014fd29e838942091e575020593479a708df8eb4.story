Vinod Hindocha, 65, was standing in a lift with his arm extending out of the cage when a chain slipped, dropping him to the ground floor

The father of  Anni Dewani, the bride murdered on her honeymoon in South Africa,is recovering in hospital after having his right arm torn off while fixing a lift.

Engineer Vinod Hindocha, 65, was carrying out repairs on March 3 in Sweden when a chain slipped, sending the lift cage he was standing in hurtling to the ground floor.

However his arm was extended outside the cage at the time, meaning it was ripped off just below the shoulder. Mr Hindocha recalls seeing the limb suspended one storey above him after he fell. 

According to The Mirror he was then taken to hospital in Gothenburg, in the country's south, where surgeons spent 13 hours reattaching the limb.

Mr Hindocha's family said he has recovered movement in his elbow, and some warmth in his fingers, but it will be 18 months before doctors will know the full extent of the damage.

The accident comes after Anni's husband, Shrien Dewani, was dramatically acquitted of ordering her killing when his trial in Cape Town collapsed late last year.

Mr Hindocha's brother Ashok, 54, said: 'He’s such a good person, he’s been through so much. Bad things happen to good people sometimes.

'He has movement in his elbow, which surgeons say is the most important thing, and his finger tips are getting warmer.

'He may not get 100 per cent movement below the elbow, but they have all sorts of techniques to help with his hand movement.'

Mr Hindocha's wife Nilam, 64, who is in remission from stomach cancer, was with him in Sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt. 

The horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by Mr Hindocha in which details of his daughter's murder were recounted in detail.

The tragedy came after Mr Hindocha saw Shrien Dewani, the husband of his murdered daughter Anni, acquitted of ordering her killing (pictured, Shrien and Anni together before they wed)

Anni was killed on November 13 2010 while driving in a cab with her new husband through the impoverished township of Gugulethu, Cape Town.

The cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw Shrien out before driving away. The vehicle was discovered the next day with Anni's body in the back seat. She had been shot in the neck.

Shortly afterwards taxi driver Zola Tongo, 35, was arrested. He confessed to his part in the death, naming Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack.

However he also claimed that Shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride, claiming he wanted out of the marriage.

Shrien was acquitted of ordering his new wife's killing after his trial in Cape Town collapsed, with the judge saying prosecutors' evidence was contradictory (pictured, Shrien during the trial)

After years of delays and legal wrangling during which Shrien claimed to be suffering from depression, he was finally extradited to South Africa to stand trial last year.

During the short case the judge heard that Shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies.

The trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses, though one of the men serving time in jail for killing Anni, Xolile Mngeni, died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence.

Eventually the judge threw the case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions. Anni's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal.
