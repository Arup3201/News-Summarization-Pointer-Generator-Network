A former executive at Swiss bank UBS was arrested Friday at a luxury hotel in Italy after being a fugitive from the U.S. for more than four years.

54-year-old Raoul Weil was staying at a hotel in Bologna where he checked in under his own name.

Police were notified since his name is on an international fugitive list.

'He was arrested at the hotel and he is now being held in prison. He did not explain why he was in Italy,' a spokesman for the Bolgona police told AFP.

News of the arrest was delayed two days due to Italian police policy.

Weill was first labeled a fugitive in January 2009 when he failed to show up in Florida federal court on charges of conspiring to help 20,000 Americans hide $20billion in assets from the IRS from 2002Â  to 2007.

He was indicted the previous November by a grand jury. When the indictment was unsealed, UBS put him on interim.

From the beginning Weil has insisted that he is innocent.

'Mr Weil denies any suggestion that he was aware of, engaged in or tolerated any illegal conduct in the operation of UBS's U.S.-cross-border business,' his attorney, Aaron Marcu, told Bloomberg in 2009. 'Mr Weil is a highly-respected banking executive in Switzerland with an unblemished record of integrity.'

If extradited to the U.S. and convicted of the tax-evasion charges, Weil could spend up to five years in prison and face $250,000 in fines.
