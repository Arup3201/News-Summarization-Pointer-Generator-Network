A 35-year-old man pretended to have been kidnapped so he could extort £125 ransom from his parents.   

Alisdair David Swift told his mother, Fiona, he'd been abducted and would not be returned by his captors unless she paid them the money. 

He came up with the idea in a bid to raise the funds to pay his gas bill, the Court of Appeal in London heard today.

Swift subjected his mother to what she described as 'the most terrifying night of her life' after sending a string of text messages in June last year that implied he had been kidnapped. 

He told his mother that he didn't know where he was and said that he would not be allowed back to his home until a debt of £125 was cleared. 

The messages continued through the night, making Mrs Swift so desperate that she phoned the police. 

But the next day officers arrived at his Sheffield home to find him in bed with his girlfriend. 

Swift, who had previously borrowed almost £7,000 from his parents in just two years, told police that he was 'living beyond his means'.  

He was jailed for 18 months at Sheffield Crown Court in July after he admitted blackmail. His sentence was halved on appeal on Monday.

Mr Justice Sweeney said the father-of-two bombarded his long-suffering parents with 'persistent demands' for cash in the two years before his scam.

'The demands, although not criminal, were relentless and unbearable,' the judge added.

He said that Mrs Swift and her husband Gerald had to create a ledger to keep track of the payments they could 'ill-afford'.

Between June 2011 and June, 2013, Swift received £6,821 from his parents but paid back just £75.

The court heard that he would often change his mobile phone number and would text his requests for cash up to three times a week.

Before midnight on June 27 last year, Swift sent his mum a text asking for £100 to pay a debt, which she transferred to his bank account.

Further texts were sent that night declaring that Swift had been sectioned and asking his parents to pay £1,000-per-week to cover the costs of caring for him.

The judge said: 'The text messages continued in the evening of June 28, in which Swift began to imply that he had been kidnapped and was in danger.

'He said that he didn't know where he was and that, until he cleared a debt of £125, he was going to be kept from his home.'

The string of texts continued through the night, making Mrs Swift so desperate that she called the police.

Mr Justice Sweeney added: 'It's clear that the parents believed the text messages and were terrified for the plight of their son.'

Mrs Swift, also of Sheffield, later described it as 'the most terrifying night of my life'.

The next day police tracked the phone being used to send the messages to Swift's home - and discovered him safely in bed with his girlfriend.

Despite initially denying any knowledge of the con, he ultimately admitted he was 'living beyond his means'. He had tried to swindle the cash to pay off rent, gas and electricity bills.

His parents said that they found themselves 'deeply conflicted' by his arrest and stressed that they did not want him to go to prison. They emphasised that they loved the 'troubled young man' very much.

To the author of a pre-sentence report, Swift said he had 'failed to think through' the consequences of what he did.

He also showed deep remorse and stressed that his relationship with his parents had since improved.

On appeal, his counsel, Richard Sheldon, argued that Judge Peter Kelson QC had punished him too harshly. He suggested that Swift's jail term should have been suspended.

Mr Justice Sweeney, sitting with Judge Michael Pert QC, said that there was 'no doubt' that the custodial threshold had been crossed and an immediate prison sentence was required.

However, Swift's 18-month jail term was 'too long', he ruled.

He concluded: 'We propose to quash the sentence imposed and to substitute for it a sentence of nine months' imprisonment.

'To that extent this appeal is allowed.'
