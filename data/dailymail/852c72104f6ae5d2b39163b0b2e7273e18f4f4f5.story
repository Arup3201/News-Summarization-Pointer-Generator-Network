So, what’s the deal with double points? Seems a bit bonkers to me.

You wouldn’t be the only who thinks it’s a loopy idea. The contentious new ruling will be used for the first time in the sport’s history this weekend, and it’s been branded a farce by the drivers and fans alike.

The idea behind it is to keep the championship alive heading into the season finale. However, it could scupper Lewis Hamilton’s bid to win a second title. Under normal circumstances he would only need to finish sixth in Abu Dhabi to guarantee the title, but with double points, he must now finish second.

Surely that isn’t fair, though?

Probably not, and the fans will probably be in uproar if Nico Rosberg triumphs by virtue of the ruling. It doesn’t make any sense for one race to be worth more than another, particularly the soulless surroundings of Abu Dhabi. 

It would have been a better idea to award double points at one of the blue-riband events; Monaco or Brazil for instance.

1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points 

2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points 

Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday week, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race.

If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish.

Whose idea was it?

You may be unsurprised to hear it was Bernie Ecclestone’s brainchild, the same man who thought the introduction of sprinklers during a race would be a good idea, too. 

The 84-year-old originally wanted the final three races to carry double points, but failed to get the green light. He’s now distanced himself from it in recent weeks. 

Indeed, in the build-up to the season finale, he said: ‘One race is stupid but imagine if it was the last three races. It means that somebody would have to have a 150-point advantage minimum to be sure they will win. The teams have not accepted it because they are bloody idiots.’

Does that mean double points will be off the menu in 2015 then?

It seems that way. The teams and drivers appear unanimous in their disdain for the ruling, and it sounds as though Ecclestone has had enough, too. ‘I don’t know what we are going to do next year,’ he claimed. 

That said, as it stands, the ruling still forms part of next year’s Sporting Regulations, so action will need to be taken over the winter to ensure they don’t return. ‘Nobody likes the double points,’ Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said. ‘We are going to discuss that next time around, I don’t think Bernie likes them, so it’s probably something we should be getting rid of for next year.’

What happens if Rosberg wins the title then? Will he be viewed as a deserving champion?

Many would see it as a case of Hamilton being robbed rather than Rosberg winning fair and square. Indeed, even if Rosberg wins on Sunday it will be his sixth of the season compared to the ten racked up by Hamilton. 

However, we should not forget that Rosberg has beaten his team-mate in qualifying this season with the Briton widely considered as one of the quickest drivers over one lap in the sport, nor that Hamilton would have lost the title to Felipe Massa in 2008 had the double points ruling been in place then. You can only play to the rules in front of you.
