If the lady in your life is closing in on the age of 31, you may not want to make too much of a fuss of the following.

According to a survey, it seems that women start adopting the same attitudes and tastes as their mothers when they are 31 – the same age as the Duchess of Cambridge.

The key turning point which sees daughters become more like their mothers is the birth of their first child.

Will the Duchess of Cambridge, pictured left yesterday at the Coronation celebration, begin morphing into Carold Middleton, right, now that she is 31 years old and expecting her first child?

Beyonce, right and her Tina Knowles, left, have always had a close relationship, and the singer's fashion designer mother came to prominence as the costume designer for her daughter's first pop group, Destiny's Child

The early 30s are also typically the 
time at which a woman gets married and starts to adjust to family life 
and the need to pay a mortgage.

More than half of the 1,000 women 
surveyed by online gambling firm Dotty Bingo said they stopped rebelling
against their mothers in their early 30s and started mimicking them 
instead. 

Only 5 per cent of women said they turned into their mothers in their 20s. By far the most popular age for the change was 31.

The Duchess celebrated her 31st birthday in January and her first baby is due in July.

She plans to live with her 58-year-old mother Carole Middleton at the family home in Berkshire following the birth.

The poll’s conclusions chimed with 
official statistics.

Figures assembled by the Office for National 
Statistics show the average age at which a woman has a baby has now 
climbed to 29.7, and the typical age at which a woman marries is 30.

Some 51 per cent of those in the study
named their mother as the most inspirational woman in their lives.

Sisters came second with 18 per cent, grandmothers gained 10 per cent 
and best friends were fourth with 8 per cent.

More than a third of those polled said giving birth was the most obvious trigger for women turning into their mothers.

30-35 - 52%

35-40 - 26%

40-50 - 10%

Over 50 - 7%

20-30 - 5%

Around a quarter said enjoying the same TV shows or soaps was a telltale sign.

Other popular indicators included 
taking up the same hobbies, using the same sayings and even being 
attracted to the same type of men.

Dotty Bingo's Craig Perrott said: 'Virtually all women turn into their mothers at some point in their lives and that is something to be celebrated.

'Our mums are the most wonderful people in our lives. It is interesting that the Duchess Cambridge has reached 31 - the age when most people think women turn into their mothers.

'Kate has just about the most glamorous mum in the world in Carole Middleton - and Carole will soon be the most glamorous granny.'
