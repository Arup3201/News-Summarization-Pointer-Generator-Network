Sportsmail reviews the action from the third day of the 2014 French Open at Roland Garros.

Tomic Snr is back, Tomic Jr is out

Bernard Tomic crashed to another straight sets defeat on Tuesday (against Richard Gasquet) but this one was in front of his notorious father John, whose ban from tournaments for assaulting Bernie’s one-time fitness trainer expired earlier this month.

The Australian did not welcome questions on the matter, branding them ‘stupid’.

At least four more years of rain

The dismal weather so far at Roland Garros so often seems to be a feature of the first week here, but patrons are going to have to wait at least four years for more cover.

Plans to build a roof over Court Philippe Chatrier are unlikely to materialise before 2018 or 2019, and that is assuming continuing objections from local residents and conservationists are overcome.

British double disappointment

Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins were among the British fallers in the doubles event, losing 7-6 6-4 to one of the most consistent pairs on the tour, Scott Lipsky and Santiago Gonzalez.

For Hutchins it means a return home and preparation for his new duties as tournament director of the Aegon Championships at Queen’s Club, the week after Roland Garros.

French open of fashion faux-pas

This has become the French Open of the fashion faux pas, with some particularly garish outfits being sported under the free and easy rules of Paris.

Andy Murray’s opponent Andrey Golubev wore a pair of camouflage patterned blue shorts, while Stella McCartney’s latest creation for Caroline Wozniacki looked something like an ice lolly.

Ivo cuts Dimitrov down to size

No 11 seed Grigor Dimitrov, seen as a potential future Wimbledon champion, was humbled  6-4, 7-5, 7-6 by Croatian giant Ivo Karlovic.
