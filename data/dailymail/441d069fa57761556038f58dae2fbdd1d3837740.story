A bike enthusiast has been dubbed the 'eco rider' after building an electric version of a classic motorcycle.

Nigel Bryant has created a stretched bike that can be propelled by a 36 volt battery-powered motor or by pedal-power.

The 56-year-old chopper motorbike fan wanted a custom-made version of the bike immortalised in the cult 1969 film Easy Rider, and he wanted it to be inexpensive and eco-friendly.

Nigel Bryant has been dubbed the 'eco rider' after building an electric version of a classic motorcycle

The bike operates like a normal bicycle but it also has a 36 volt battery-powered motor.

The motor allows it to travel at a top speed of 20mph but the battery needs recharging every 30 minutes.

It can be powered solely by pedalling, just using the motor, or using a combination of the two.

It is virtually silent, emission free and very cheap to run.

So, he spent £1,000 making the 6ft 5ins long bike that features 3.5ft long elongated front forks and handlebars to give it a recumbent appearance.

However, 'road trips' on the bike are limited as it has a top speed of 20mph and can only run for 30 miles before the battery needs recharging or pedal-power has to be employed.

Mr Bryant, from Poole, Dorset, set about making the bike after he was made redundant from his job as a university scientific support officer and found himself with time on his hands.

He created by the bespoke frame with help from a firm that specialises in metal tubing.

He then purchased an old Stringray chopper bicycle from eBay and dismantled it so he could use some of the parts.

He paid for the elongated front forks to be shipped over from America and attached the lithium battery which is hidden in one of the panniers.

The blue bike, which was built in Mr Bryant’s workshop at his home, is virtually silent, emission free and far cheaper to run than any normal motorbike.

Maybe that is why he often gets thumbs-up signs, and comments like 'cool bike', whenever he rides the machine through the streets of Poole.

Mr Bryant said: ‘I have been building custom motorbikes for years but with petrol becoming ever more expensive, an eco-friendly means of transport made perfect sense.

‘Also, everything these days needs to be tested and if you build a custom motorbike from scratch it needs to be inspected and insured but you can make a bicycle how you want to.

‘I wanted to make a version of a chopper as I have always loved them, so to customise a bicycle in this way seemed like the best of both worlds.’

He added: ‘You can use the bike in three ways; operate it completely by pedalling, use the auto-pedalling feature that kicks in the motor or use the thumb throttle.

‘As it relies on a battery it is absolutely quiet and there are no emissions.

‘People often point it out when I'm riding it and some say I must have long legs or that it looks hard to ride, but that's far from the truth.’
