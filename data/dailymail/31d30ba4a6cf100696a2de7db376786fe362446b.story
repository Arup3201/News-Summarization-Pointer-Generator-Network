Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez are inspiring awe with freakish regularity. For the Argentine, it is rocket shots from all angles. For the Chilean, it is his uncanny knack of scoring at just the right time.

On Wednesday night, each delivered again. Aguero took his Premier League tally to 14 goals with a double of sheer beauty at Sunderland; Sanchez reached nine with a late finish to claim victory over stubborn Southampton.

Both have South American flair in spades, but it is each player’s steely resolve to win games for their team which is most impressive.

Both Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez (right) have been key for their teams this season

Aguero has scored 45 per cent of Manchester City’s goals in the Premier League this season. Sanchez’s strikes account for 41 per cent of Arsenal’s total.

Each forward has directly won nine points through their contributions so far (goals and assists) – and are single-handedly raising their clubs up the division, as these tables show.

City slump six places to eighth with Aguero out of the equation. Erase him from Manuel Pellegrini’s selections and there would be no four-goal demolition of Tottenham translating a defeat to victory, no winner against Manchester United, no rescue mission at Queens Park Rangers.

Arsenal plummet even further minus Sanchez – eight places to 14th. As much as his tenacity and technique are a joy to behold, his empirical importance is what Arsene Wenger will value. He has salvaged draws from defeats against Leicester, Manchester City, and Hull – won the game at Sunderland and set his side on the path to late victory over Burnley.

Aguero’s qualities are well-established – it is more than two years since Aguerooooo won the title for City – but his level right now, at 26, is approaching the heights climbed only by the best this country has seen. For impact and ingenuity, he is matching the likes of Luis Suarez, Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Sanchez has taken to English football with an ease that is not necessarily guaranteed by a large transfer cheque. Aged 25, he is still on an upward curve, making his £30million fee last summer appear ever more a bargain as each defining goal hits the back of the net.

Even after only 14 Premier League games, it is clear the final finishing positions of City and Arsenal will be determined by the form and fitness of two men measuring 5ft 8in and 5ft 7in. Size doesn’t matter, goals do.

Diego Costa has scored 11 goals for Chelsea since joining from Atletico Madrid in the summer

P.S. Diego Costa, on 11 goals, separates Aguero and Sanchez in second at the top of the scoring charts. He has stormed into this league but is not as individually important as the other two. Without his goals and assists Chelsea would still be first, such is their supremacy and spread of contributors. Five points fewer, but still No 1.
