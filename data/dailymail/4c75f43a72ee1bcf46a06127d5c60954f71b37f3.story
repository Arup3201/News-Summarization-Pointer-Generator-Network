Forget old-hat singing competitions or watching celebrities fine tune their Waltz, the BBC is launching a new entertainment show to find Britain's Brightest brain.

The new show will next year take the prime-time Saturday night slot currently occupied by the much criticised singing contest The Voice.

It is hoped Britain's Brightest will help promote intelligence rather than beauty or fame. 

Game show host: Clare Balding will present a new TV show called Britain's Brightest which will test contestants' intelligence

The show will see 24 'ordinary people with extraordinary minds' selected from auditions around Britain go head to head in tasks to test the brain and examining everything from emotional intelligence to processing speed.

After a series of demanding challenges and puzzles staged in studio and on location, the contestant with the best all-round mind will be crowned champion.

Auditions have already taken place and the programme, hosted by Clare Balding, will air in January.

Clare Balding said: 'I have always said that "facts are my friend" but knowing things doesn't make you clever. 

Being replaced: Britain's Brightest will take prime-time Saturday night slot previously occupied by singing contest The Voice

'I am fascinated by the brain - how it works and how it can be improved.

'I am so excited to be given the opportunity to explore and test intelligence in a format that will be fun, informative and entertaining.

'The quest to find Britain's Brightest will inspire all of us.'

Danny Cohen, controller of BBC One, told the Daily Telegraph that airing the 'intelligence' show on Saturday night was an 'interesting risk'.

He added: 'This is an intelligence test format and it will bring a new flavour to the channel.
