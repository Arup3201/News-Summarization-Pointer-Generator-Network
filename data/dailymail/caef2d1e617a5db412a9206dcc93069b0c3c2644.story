The family of a British man who died in mysterious circumstances in Thailand have made an appeal for money needed to fly his body home.

Sam Austin, 26, died on November 13, just weeks after flying out to Asia to start a new life, but the Thai authorities are yet to tell his distraught family how it happened.

The popular labourer had not taken out travel insurance so his parents must foot the bill to bring his body back to Britain.

Tragedy: Mr Austin did not have travel insurance so his friends and family have to pay for him to repatriated

Friends and family in Bedminster, Bristol, have turned to crowdfunding to raise the £15,000 required.

Mr Austin had visited Thailand several times before but decided to make the move permanent a few weeks ago, finding bar work when he arrived.

The first his mother Kalpana Austin, 48, knew about her son's death was when police left a note asking her to contact them.

After she replied, officers came back to her house and broke the news that Mr Austin had died in a 'tragic accident' - but so far no details of what happened have been released.

Ms Austin said: 'The thought of him being over there so far away is awful. He should be back home with his friends and family who love him.' 

Mr Austin's friend Jonna Russell, 28, has launched a crowdfunding website and a Facebook page in his honour.

So far more than 300 friends and family have donated £8,200, more than half of the cash needed to repatriate Mr Austin's body.

If they do not make the total then the labourer will have to buried or cremated in Thailand.

Mystery: Thai authorities are yet to reveal details of how Mr Austin died. His family now need to raise £15,000 to bring him home

Mr Russell, a chef who used to live with Sam, said: 'I always thought that a British passport was a ticket to get back home if anything happens to you but it does not work like that.

'If you are not insured, then your family and friends have to raise the money to repatriate.

'He was a great guy and had lots of friends. We cannot believe what has happened.

'The least we can do is to try to bring him back home where he belongs.'

The fundraising page says: 'Anything we can raise above that total will go to his mum to make sure she's looked after - a promise a few of us made to him before he left for Thailand.

'Basically give as much as you can, we need to get Sam back to Bristol.'
