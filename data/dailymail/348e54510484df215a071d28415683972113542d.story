This lucky zebra dramatically earned his stripes by fighting off a vicious crocodile attack.

A herd of zebras had been enjoying a refreshing drink at a waterhole in Kenya when a group of crocodiles crept up on them.

Suddenly one of the fearsome predators launches itself out of the water, only narrowly missing its prey with its razor sharp teeth.

Instinctively the zebra lashes out, kicking its back hoof straight into the face of the croc, forcing it to retreat.

Photographers Laurent Renaud and Dominique Haution captured the watery war while on safari in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya.

Laurent, a 55-year-old teacher from northern France, said: "It was all very dramatic.

"About 100 zebras were trying to cross the river and they just stopped for a quick drink.

"Some zebras have seen a crocodile before, but many just think they're logs.

"Fortunately they always remain apprehensive while drinking which meant all of them got away safely.

"At the end, the crocodiles were furious - they were angrily baring their teeth from across the river."

Relief: The zebra stands on the bank after its miraculous escape

Grinning: The fortunate animal almost appears to smile after escaping becoming crocodile's meal

Out of luck: The crocodiles are left looking hungry and fed up on the opposite bank
