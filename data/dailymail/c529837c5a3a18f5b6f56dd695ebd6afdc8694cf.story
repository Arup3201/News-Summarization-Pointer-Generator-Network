 Up to 50,000 jobs could be lost in Britain if the country’s biggest defence company joins forces with its Franco-German rival, a report warns today.

Many of the cutbacks will come in firms that supply BAE with parts – but thousands of workers directly employed by it could also be under threat.

The acknowledgement that the merger would lead to widespread job losses comes amid growing opposition to the deal.

It is mired in controversy over how much control the French and German governments will enjoy over the new company.

Berlin is threatening to block the deal unless it has its headquarters in Munich.

However, last night Defence Secretary
Philip Hammond said the Government here is also prepared to intervene –
if the deal threatens the UK’s national interest.

He said the Coalition would tolerate some French and German control of the company but their shares should be limited.

And he said Britain would insist on the defence arm of the new company being ‘headquartered in the UK’.

He added: ‘We have made very clear that we do have red lines and that if they can’t be satisfied then we will use our special share to veto the deal.

‘But it’s not, I think, necessary to have no French or German government interest in the company; it is necessary to reduce that stake below the level at which it can direct the way the company acts.

We want to see this company, and I think the management wants to see this company, prospering as a commercial business, focused on doing the things that are right for the business, not being beholden to or controlled by any one.’

Downing Street has sought to suggest that David Cameron will seek a guarantee that British jobs would be preserved.

But a well-placed source in the Ministry of Defence has told the Mail that this will not be possible.‘Jobs will certainly go in the short and medium term,’ the source said.

‘There’s nothing we can do about that.’

A report by financial health specialists Company Watch said the merger threatens the future of 7,500 BAE suppliers in the UK with 52,000 staff.

That is on top of the 35,000 workers employed by BAE directly in Britain.

Company Watch warned that firms that supply BAE could see contracts and job opportunities migrate to European companies already supplying EADS.

BAE spends more than £4billion every year with its suppliers, from manufacturing giants such as Rolls-Royce to the cafes that make lunch for engineers.

Nick Hood of Company Watch, said: ‘The merger may have the unexpected side effect of threatening not just supply companies and their employees, but the UK’s climb out of double dip recession.

‘This is no time to play with the fate of 7,500 UK suppliers and their 52,000 employees.’

The combined company would also be ‘significantly’ weaker financially than BAE, says the report, because EADS is not as strong.

Ben Wallace: Leading the opposition to the deal

‘BAE suppliers that manage to retain 
their relationship with the merged operation will find themselves forced
to deal with a customer with a much less positive credit profile,’ said
the report.

It also warned that suppliers could have to renegotiate their contracts on less favourable terms.

MP
Ben Wallace, who is co-ordinating Tory opposition to the deal, said: 
‘It is obvious that small British businesses will be made vulnerable by 
this decision.

'They haven’t even guaranteed the jobs at BAE.’

Mr Wallace sent a letter signed by 45 Tory MPs to David Cameron demanding Britain veto the deal unless the French and German governments sell their stakes in EADS.

Both want shares of between 9 and 13 per cent in the new company.

The Spanish government claims 5 per cent.

That means the three European governments could control a key 25 per cent of the firm.

‘Why would they want to own it if they don’t want to manipulate it?,’ Mr Wallace said.

BAE is also facing a revolt from its shareholders.

Two of the ten biggest say BAE has failed to tell them what is going on.
