Traditional Double Gloucester cheese could disappear from Britain for good - because the breed of cow which produces it is dying out, experts have warned.

Farmers claim there are now fewer than 450 Gloucester Cattle left in the country thanks to EU regulations over TB and a lack of interest from breeders.

If the breed became extinct it would spell the end of Single Gloucester cheese and 'real' Double Gloucester, which is only made from pedigree cows.

Joe Henson, who has helped protect rare breeds for four decades at Cotswold Park Farm near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said the loss would be 'devastating' for cheese production.

Mr Henson, the father of BBC Countryfile star Adam Henson, said: 'It would be heartbreaking if we were to lose the breed.

'Apart from them being my favourite breed there would be devastating consequences - especially for cheeses.

'Both single and double Gloucester cheese have become renowned, not only in England, but around the world.

'Back in the day you wouldn't be able to get milk from Gloucester to London before it went off so they would make Double Gloucester cheese with it instead.'

He said one of the primary reasons for the lack of Gloucester Cattle was due to the TB regulations imposed by the EU.

The herds are at an increased risk as many of them are kept in Gloucestershire, which is a TB hotspot.

Mr Henson said that the breed would survive a lot longer if they could be vaccinated against TB.

He said: 'If we were able to give our cattle TB vaccinations then they would stand a much better change of lasting longer.

'Unfortunately we can't do this because of EU regulations. Their rules prohibit the use of TB vaccinations.

'This is because if a cow has been vaccinated against it, when blood is taken from the vaccinated animals it will test positive for the disease.'

Gloucester cows have always been lower in numbers than other breeds of cattle due to the fact they produce less milk.

But the milk they do produce is well-suited for cheese making due to the fact it is high in protein and butterfat.

Single Gloucester cheese is made exclusively from Gloucester cattle milk - meaning it would no longer be produced if the cows were extinct.

It has PDO (protected designation of origin) status so it can only be made from Gloucester cattle in Gloucester.

Double Gloucester cheese is now widely made from the milk of any cattle, but the extinction of the breed would spell the end for 'traditional' Double Gloucester.

Mr Henson explained: 'Double Gloucester can now be made using the milk of other cows but it is not quite the same.

'It would be like making your own champagne at home and calling it champagne - it doesn't quite work.'

Clifford Freeman, 50, who has worked with the cattle alongside his father at the family farm near Hartpury, Gloucestershire, since he was just seven, said: 'The number of Gloucester cows has seriously been declining over the years.

'One of the reasons for this is due to the TB regulations that have been brought into play.

'It makes moving bulls around very difficult and so a lot of farmers have given up breeding their Gloucester cattle.

Gloucester is a traditional, semi-hard cheese which has been made in Gloucestershire since the 16th century.

There are two types - Single and Double - and both are traditionally made from milk from Gloucestershire breed cows.

Both types have a natural rind and a hard texture, but Single Gloucester is more crumbly and lighter in texture.

The reason for the two types being referred to as Double and Single is not known but theories include because the creamy milk had to be skimmed twice to make the double variety, or because cream from the morning milk was added to the evening milk. 

There is also a theory that it was because Double Gloucester cheese is typically twice the height.

'Also back in the 1970s there was lots of enthusiasm to increase the numbers of the breed. However all of those farmers are now in their 80s.

'Single Gloucester cheese can only be produced by people with Gloucester cattle, so without them we wouldn't see it on the shelf any more.

'Double Gloucester can now be made using milk from other cows but it would be a bit like having a Cornish Pasty that wasn't from Cornwall.'

Back in 1972 the breed was in danger of dying out - with just 60 bovines left, however a group of dedicated farmers worked to increase the herds to almost 1,000 but the 1990s.

Now, the Gloucester breed, which has a white belly, tail and stripe down its spine, is in danger once again with just 450 registered cattle still alive.

The milk of Gloucester cows is well-suited for cheese making due to the fact it is high in protein and butterfat.

Clifford, a member of the Gloucester Cattle Society, added: 'I would be absolutely devastated if the breed was to die out.

'Not forgetting these cows were also used to test cures for small pox - they are a crucial part of bovine history.

'People need to be given a reason to want to carry on breeding that cattle.'
