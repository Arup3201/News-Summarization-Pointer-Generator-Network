A top cop has issued a stark warning to 'predatory' men in the police force who commit sexual harassment and violence against women. 

In announcing the new review Chief Commissioner Ken Lay for Victorian Police says he 'loves' the force but that type of behaviour will not be accepted. 

The review will be overseen by the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission (VEOHRC), and will start in early 2015.

Chief Commissioner Ken Lay wants to stop 'predatory' men and harassment

Chief Commissioner Lay branded the behaviour 'shameless' and he said it needs to stop in the police force

Chief Commissioner Lay told a press conference: 'There are some men in this organisation whose behaviour towards women is reprehensible.

'We have a number of investigations looking into the shameless conduct by our people. 

'A small percentage of our members target and relentlessly take advantage of women by using their power and influence.

'It is based on a sense of entitlement by some men, who think it's okay to sexually harass, intimidate, and degrade women.' 

Chief Commissioner Lay has asked VEOHRC to be frank and fearless with their advice.

He said the problem of sexual harassment was 'not widespread' but it was occurring within Victoria Police. 

Chief Commissioner Lay explained that women  should be able to work 'without fear of intimidation, of being jeered, groped or verbally abused' by male officers. 

'This behaviour is simply unacceptable, and has no relationship to our sworn duty to uphold the right. 

The Commissioner said: 'There are some men in this organisation whose behaviour towards women is reprehensible' 

'I have devoted my entire working life to Victoria Police because I'm passionate about the organisation. But I know it isn't perfect.' 

The commissioner was joined by the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commissioner Kate Jenkins at the announcement of the investigation. 

A new Victoria Police taskforce, called Invenio, has also been set up to investigate all complaints of this nature and collect intelligence to inform VEOHRC’s review.  

A number of internal investigations are already under way with the Victorian police force

The first phase of the review, which will run until November 2015, and it will be focused on research and data collection. 

From this information VEOHRC will develop a plan for Victoria Police of actions to promote equality, safety and freedom from sexual harassment in the workplace. 

They will monitor and publicly report on progress for three years.
