Watching car chases in films such as The Italian Job make motorists more dangerous behind the wheel, a study has found.

Those who watch more movies with reckless driving scenes while growing up were more likely to behave carelessly in the driver's seat, according to the research.

Action films including The Fast and Furious and The Italian Job had a negative effect on young people, regardless of their background or character.

Behavioural scientists asked almost 2,000 young people in the U.S. about the movies they watched when they were aged between 10 and 14 in 2003.

They then re-interviewed them a further five times over subsequent years and, during the final interview, they were probed about their driving behaviour.

Questions included whether they weaved in and out of traffic, were tailgaters and how much they sped.

Evelien Kostermans, lead researcher from Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, said: ‘Adolescents were more likely to drive recklessly the higher the proportion of movies they had seen that showed reckless driving behaviours.

‘This effect was independent of many other influencing factors, such as socio-economic status, parental influence, or a sensation-seeking personality.’

She added: ‘Perhaps ratings and censor boards should consider reckless driving as part of the ratings criteria.’ 

Writing in the journal PLoS ONE, the researchers said their study was the first to ‘show a direct long-term relation between passive exposure to reckless driving content in movies and reckless driving among adolescents’.

Repeated exposure to ‘risk-glorifying media’ may promote risk-taking by creating positive associations with such behaviour, they said.

Dr Kostermans added: ‘They internalise the idea that it is okay to drive like that, that it is a normal thing to do because they see it all the time in those movies.

‘Parents should understand that adolescents model behaviours they see in movies and should restrict children and adolescents in the number and types of movies they are allowed to watch each week.'
