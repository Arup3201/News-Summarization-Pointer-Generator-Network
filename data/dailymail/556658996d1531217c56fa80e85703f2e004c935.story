Each year, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants cross into the United States via the Mexican border desperate for opportunity. Some are caught and deported while others are successful, but at the cost of never being able to travel freely again.  

An even more unfortunate group never survive the journey, and die on the border - their new life in America just within reach.

Their remains, and the personal items they left behind, are discovered by border patrol officers and local ranchers. 

Left behind: The crucifix of a broken rosary and coins that belonged to a person whose skeletal remains were found in the Arizona desert on September 12, 2014

Belongings: Each year, the Pima County Medical Examiner's Office receives about 176 remains recovered from the desert, most of which belong to undocumented immigrants who died of dehydration trying to cross into the U.S. Above, a bible, chapstick and lighter found on a body discovered June 19, 2014

Each year, Arizona's Pima County Medical Examiner's Office receives about 176 bodies recovered from the border. 

Currently, the remains of 90 bodies are stored at the center, where forensic anthropologists try to identify the remains, which usually belong to undocumented immigrants who died of dehydration trying to cross into the U.S. 

If they are able to identify the remains, they are repatriated back to the deceased's home country, along with their personal items.  Others are cremated. 

Some of the items are common: a box of matches, chapstick and change. Things you'd find in almost anyone's pocket.

Others tell a story of what that person was doing they died. A letter to a loved one,  a piece of paper with U.S. phone numbers, and a list of items not to forget on their journey across the border. Water tops the list.

Be prepared: A list of items to bring, along with Mexican money, are kept in a sealed bag of personal effects, after they were found on skeletal remains in the Arizona desert on June 1, 2014

Contacts: A list of American phone numbers was among the items found on a body in the Arizona desert

All that remains: A comb, change and a Mexican identification are kept in a sealed bag of personal effects at the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner on December 9, 2014 in Tucson, Arizona. The items were with the decomposed remains of a Mexican male, 25, found in the Arizona desert on August 1, 2014

'We have to win': A wallet which reads in Spanish reads Tenemos Que Ganar or We Have To Win in English, is kept in a sealed bag of personal effects at the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner on December 9, 2014 in Tucson, Arizona.
