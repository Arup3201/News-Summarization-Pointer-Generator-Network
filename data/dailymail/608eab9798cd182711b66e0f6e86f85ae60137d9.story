Daniel Ricciardo has become the fourth Australian ever to win a Formula One Grand Prix after he drove to victory in Canada on Sunday.

Ricciardo, 24, from Perth in Western Australia, took advantage of electrical problems that hindered top-ranked Nico Rosberg and his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who retired with mechanical failure when vying for the lead of the race.

On Sunday Ricciardo said he was in shock over his win.

'This is ridiculous,' he said. 'I think it still seems a bit surreal to be honest, just because it all happened so quickly at the end. I was third for a while and then it all happened in a really exciting fashion.'

Australian Grand Prix Corporation chief Andrew Westacott said Ricciardo, who drives for Red Bull, had a lot of experience for his age but said his success was impressive.

'Formula One is the pinnacle of motor sport in the world and Daniel is driving for the team that has been world champion for the last four years,' Mr Westacott told MailOnline.

'And his teammate is Sebastian Vettel, four-time world champion, so it doesn’t get better than that.'

After the seventh round of Grand Prix in Canada Ricciardo is ranked third in the drivers' standings, behind Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.

'It’s not surprising that he's [finishing top three] but what's surprising is that seven races in he's ahead of the current world champion Sebastian Vettel,' Mr Westacott said.

Last month, Red Bull Formula One boss Christian Horner said the team had not expected Ricciardo to perform so well when they team chose him to replace Australian Mark Webber in 2014.

'Daniel has been a real surprise this year,' Mr Horner told Sky Sports F1.

'We knew he was quick, we just didn't realise how quick. And he is so cool as well, he is quick, he’s good looking, he has got everything going for him.'

On Sunday, Red Bull designer Adrian Newey said: 'Daniel is an amazing young man. What impresses me most is how calming he is when he comes on the team radio. We were a bit lucky today in truth but we were there and ready.'

The win was extra sweet for Ricciardo, who in March had a second place podium finish in Melbourne taken from him because his Red Bull team broke fuel flow regulations.

Ricciardo grew up in Perth with his father Joe, who owns an earth-moving business, and his mother Grace. His parents were always very supportive of his passion for racing.

Delight: Ricciardo overtook Nico Rosberg with two laps left of an eventful race in Montreal

1. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) - 140

2. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - 118

3. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) - 79

4. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) - 69

5. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) - 60

He started racing at the age of nine, and was a champion in karting up until the age of 16.

His first foray into international motorsport came in 2006, when he won a scholarship into the Formula BMW Asian championship with Eurasia Motorsport.

In 2009 he became the British F3 International Series Champion, but Ricciardo's career really started to take off when he was given a spot on Red Bull's junior Formula One racing team Scuderia Toro Rosso in 2011.

'He got his break by getting a drive in the Toro Rosso team and then he learned his craft for a couple of seasons,' Mr Westacott said.

He continued driving for Toro Rosso during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. When Mark Webber retired from the higher-budget Red Bull team, Ricciardo took his place.

Ricciardo's win makes him the fourth Australian to win a Grand Prix, after  Alan Jones, Mark Webber and the late Jack Brabham.

The Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday was a dramatic one.

Williams' Felipe Massa and Force India's Sergio Perez were admitted to hospital following a horror last-lap collision.

Marussia team-mates Jules Bianchi and Max Chilton also collided, leaving a smear of oil on the track.

And Mercedes' Hamilton was forced to retire after 45 laps, with smoke coming from his car due to rear break failure. His team-mate Rosberg came in at second place.
