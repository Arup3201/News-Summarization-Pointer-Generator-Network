The orphan daughter of Kansas City Chief Jovan Belcher will now be cared for by his mother.

Belcher shot Kasandra 
Perkins his 22-year-old girlfriend and the mother of his child before driving to Arrowhead stadium and turning the gun on 
himself.

The murder-suicide on Saturday morning left the couple's 3-month-old daughter Zoey an orphan.

But now relatives have said his mother  Cheryl Shepherd, will take responsibility for the infant, reported the New York Post.

It is thought she will raise her grandaughter at the Long Island home where the 25-year-old grew up.

Ms Shepherd had been in Kansas City to help Belcher and his girlfriend with their young daughter when the incident happened.

On Saturday he shot Perkins dead in a row when she came home from an R&B concert the night before.

His mother discovered the body as she was living in the house and called 911.

Belcher then drove to his team’s stadium and shot himself dead in front of his coach and general manager.

The couple had doted on their young 
daughter - they posted several photos on the internet showing Perkins 
holding the infant when she was born as well as photos of the trio.

'She just lost a son. We're all coming together,' Eric Oakes, a cousin of Belcher, told the New York Post.

Cheryl Shepherd said yesterday family was heartbroken over both deaths.

'Right now, we are grieving for Kasandra and Jovan,' she said in a telephone interview to Newsday.

'We are in mourning.'

Ms Shepherd was a big influence in her son's life.

Belcher told the Bangor Daily News that he credited his mother and three older sisters with giving him support.

'My mother is a hardworking woman,' he said.

'To see her overcome some things and 
succeed, it makes me look at things and say, 'This isn't even hard.' I 
didn't really have a father figure, so they provided nice guidance for 
me.'

Dwayne Wilmot, who was Belcher's 
position coach at Maine, recalled that the easiest way to make him smile
was to tell him his mother was coming to a game.

'Family was paramount for Jovan. You could see it at every game,' said Wilmot, now a coach at Yale.

Happier times: Belcher and Kasandra M. Perkins, had lived apart briefly earlier in the year but had gotten back together by Thanksgiving, according to a friend of Perkins

Belcher and Perkins, had lived apart briefly earlier in the year but had gotten back together by Thanksgiving, according to a friend of Perkins.

Brianne York, 21, said Sunday the couple, argued about 'normal couple stuff' but that her friend was 'really happy about being a mom.'

When she learned Saturday that Belcher had fatally shot Perkins at the couples' home, York said, she thought someone must have been mistaken.

Sunday found Crennel on the 
sidelines, bravely holding together a team in turmoil. The Chiefs 
rallied to a 27-21 victory over the Carolina Panthers, breaking an 
eight-game losing streak.

'It was tough,' said quarterback 
Brady Quinn. 'It was an eerie feeling after a win, because you don't 
think you can really win in this situation.'

York, who met Perkins while taking 
classes at the Blue River campus of Metropolitan Community College, said
the women bonded during their pregnancies. York has a baby boy who was 
born months before Perkins gave birth to Zoey.

'It doesn't seem that that would be 
the end of their story,' York said. 'It just seems like if things didn't
work out, they would have gone their separate ways. I would never have 
thought that this would be how it ended.'

York said that sometime after Halloween Perkins had gone to visit her family in Texas. Perkins also briefly stayed with her cousin, who is married to Chiefs player Jamaal Charles. Belcher and Perkins met through Charles, York said.

York said the root of the argument was that Belcher, 'sometimes he would just be down in his man cave or whatever,' and Perkins wanted to spend more time together as a family.

'They ended up wanting to try to work it out,' York said, 'and the next time I went over and visited she told me everything was good and things were better, so I thought everything was fine.'

Kansas City police spokesman Darin Snapp reiterated Sunday that the couple had argued recently but he could provide no additional details.

At the couple's former home, people could be seen coming and going Sunday. 'Can you all respect grieving?' said a man who answered the door at the couple's home. A short time later, at the same time the Chiefs were playing, two men loaded bags into a car, and two women drove away.

Attempts to reach various members of Perkins' family in Austin, Texas, were unsuccessful.

Neighbors in the newly built Kansas City subdivision where the couple had lived since April were stunned by Saturday's violent events.

Kristen VanMeter, 31, lives near the couple and said also she had taken community-college courses with Perkins. VanMeter said the couple threw 'a lot of parties' but said she heard nothing unusual the morning of the killing.

'It's a surprise,' she said. 'There had to of been something that triggered it.'

Shawn Martin, vice president of the neighborhood homeowners association, said she wasn't aware of any problems that preceded the shooting.

She described the parties at the home Belcher and Perkins shared as 'nothing more than any other young couple' would have.

After having the baby, Perkins was taking the fall semester off school. York said Perkins planned to return in January and wanted to become a teacher.

Police said Belcher's mother was living with the couple, but York said she just made frequent visits, sometimes lasting a couple weeks at a time. She doesn't know who will care for the baby now.

'They just seemed really happy around each other, and I just don't understand where things went wrong,' York said.

York said the only other stress Perkins mentioned was whether Belcher would stay with the Chiefs.

'She was a really good person to be around and a lot of fun,' York said. 'She was somebody you could call when you were down and she would talk you through it. She would lift you back up and make you feel happy again if you were sad or upset.'
