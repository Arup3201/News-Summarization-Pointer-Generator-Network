Jeffrey Fowle, the American man held captive in North Korea for the past six months, beamed with happiness today as he appeared with his family for the first time after arriving home in the U.S.

The 56-year-old greeted the media with his wife and three young children outside their home in rural Miamisburg, Ohio on Wednesday morning. 

Mr Fowle had earlier landed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton after being flown in by the Department of Defense. 

He was met on the tarmac by his wife and elated children who rushed to hug him after having no idea that their father was returning home.

The family attorney made a brief statement on Mr Fowle's behalf today, saying that he was overjoyed to be reunited with his family.

The statement also referred to the two Americans still being held in Pyongyang - Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller - and the continued struggle for their families. 

Attorney Timothy Tepe said Mr Fowle had been treated well by the North Korean government and needed time to adjust to life at home.

'The past 24 hours have been a whirlwind for Jeff and his family. Jeff needs some time right now to get adjusted to his life at home,' Tepe said. 

The New York Times reported today that North Korea said Kim Jong-un, had personally ordered the release of Mr Fowle following requests from President Obama.

The State Department announced on Tuesday that Mr Fowle had been released. 

The news came about six months after he was taken into custody after leaving a Bible at a nightclub. Christian evangelism is considered a crime in North Korea.

He had been awaiting trial - the only one of three Americans held by Pyongyang who had not been convicted of charges.

The two others were each sentenced to years in North Korean prisons after court trials that lasted no more than 90 minutes. The three Americans entered North Korea separately.

Fowle was flown out of North Korea on a U.S. military jet that was spotted at Pyongyang's international airport on Tuesday. 

There was no immediate explanation for the release of Fowle, who was whisked to the U.S. territory of Guam before heading back to his wife and three children in Ohio.

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Tuesday that Mr Fowle was seen by doctors and appeared to be in good medical health. 

She declined to give more details about his release except to thank the government of Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, for its 'tireless efforts'. 

Harf would not say whether any American officials had intervened directly with the North Koreans.

Relations between Washington and Pyongyang, never warm, are at a particularly low point, and the U.S. has sought unsuccessfully for months to send a high-level representative to North Korea to negotiate acquittals for all three men.

In Berlin, Secretary of State John Kerry said 'there was no quid pro quo' for the release of Fowle.

'We are very concerned about the remaining American citizens who are in North Korea, and we have great hopes that North Korea will see the benefit of releasing them also as soon as possible,' Kerry told reporters.

'We're in constant touch with their families, we're working on their release, we've talked to the Chinese and others, and we have a high focus on it,' he said.

The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea and strongly warns American citizens against traveling to the country.

Fowle arrived there on April 29 and was arrested in May for leaving a Bible at the nightclub. Christian evangelism is considered a crime in North Korea.

The city where Fowle worked as a streets department employee terminated his employment last month.

'We're delighted to hear the news and look forward to him returning to the community and his family,' David Hicks, Moraine's city manager, said on Tuesday.

The Dayton Daily News reported last month that the city said Fowle's termination included $70,000 in severance pay and the ability to be reinstated.
