Jeremy Frazier Newsome Smith, 45, who is alleged to have raped a woman after he performed a kinky show while dressed up as Herman Munster

A woman was forced to watch her own rape in a room full of mirrors in a swingers club, a court has heard.

Jeremy Frazier Newsome Smith, 45, is alleged to have assaulted the woman after he performed a kinky show while dressed up as sitcom character Herman Munster.

The woman - who was also in costume - told the court she endured the sex attack in a room lined with mirrors, so that no matter where she looked she was witnessing her own rape.

'I could see everything that was happening,' she said in videotaped testimony. 'I tried to look away but the walls were covered in mirrors so I had to watch everything.'

Smith denies the allegation of rape, saying the two had consensual sex and claiming that she had 'been flirting with him throughout the evening'.

The pair met at La Chambre private members club in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, at an event last October. Charlotte Baines, prosecuting, told the jury: 'This was a private members club commonly known as a swingers’ club.

'It opens its doors to members with a view to them watching or participating in sexual activity, if they wish to do so.

'Upstairs in this club there are rooms commonly known as "play rooms" for individuals who want to engage in sexual activity.

'The night the incident took place was the weekend before Halloween. The defendant was there with two friends, Luke Williams and Robin Colville, performing a cabaret act.

'He was dressed as Herman Munster, known as the Frankenstein monster, while he friend Mr Colville was dressed in drag as Mrs Munster, and Mr Williams was dressed as Harry Potter.'

The court heard that during the night, Smith had invited the woman to take part in kinky games involving her being put into stocks and having her underwear pulled down.

She said the act was 'really embarrassing' and later in the evening the defendant plied the woman and her two friends with drinks, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

Miss Baines said the defendant had asked the woman to go with him upstairs, which she did at the request her friend came with her.

The woman’s and defendant’s mates chatted upstairs throughout the evening, during which she told her friends 'I think he’s going to try something with me'.

Miss Baines said: 'As they all left down the stairs, the defendant and the complainant were at the back of the group.

'The defendant put his arm across the stairs on the stairwell to stop her and indicated to her he wanted to go for a cigarette.

'She told him she didn’t smoke but didn’t want to kick up a fuss. The two went to an indoor smoking area in the club, which is an open air room in the club were people are permitted to smoke.'

Once there, Miss Baines told the jury, the defendant began to kiss the alleged victim.

In a video given as evidence in court, the complainant told police: 'I just felt as though I was paralysed. I was so scared I didn’t even know what to do. I knew what was going to happen.'

The complainant described how the defendant began to touch her and then raped her, while she was forced to watch in the mirror-covered walls of the club. She said that afterwards he refused to give back her underwear.

Soon after, she was reunited with her friends and told them what had happened. The group alerted staff at the club before going to make a complaint at a nearby police station.

Smith claims the pair add consensual sex. Miss Baines said: 'The defendant claims she was willing to enter the upstairs area of the club with him, and that they were looking through the windows of the rooms.'

She added: 'The defendant says they had consensual sex, and that he kept her underwear to save her from embarrassment when her friends came into the room.'

The trial continues.
