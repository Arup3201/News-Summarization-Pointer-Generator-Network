Death: Ivan Emmanuel Campbell suffered internal injuries, possibly caused by just one fatal blow

A care home worker was today arrested on suspicion of murdering a 73-year-old resident.

Father-of-two Ivan Emmanuel Campbell suffered internal injuries, possibly caused by just one fatal blow, at the private Victoria Nursing Home in Rusholme, Greater Manchester, last April.

He was admitted to hospital after being found by other care home staff, but he died a day later. It was discovered that Mr Campbell had suffered a fractured rib and died from internal injuries.

A Home Office post-mortem report found these injuries to be non-accidental and, after his fractured rib was discovered, it was believed they were caused by a single blow.

The 34-year-old man was arrested this morning on suspicion of the murder of Campbell and in relation to another assault on a resident that happened on Tuesday last week. That incident involved staff calling police to attend a man aged 72 who had suffered a fractured rib.

The member of staff is currently suspended from the home, just south of Manchester, which cares for people with complex mental health needs.

It was understood that Mr Campbell was an outpatient at Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust and he was being assessed every six months by a psychiatrist.

He was believed to have been suffering from mental health issues, including possible dementia.

Since the original incident Greater Manchester Police has been working closely with the owner of the home and its staff, as well as Manchester City Council, the NHS, Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust and the Care Quality Commission as part of the ongoing investigation.

Officers: Mr Campbell had been in care at the private Victoria Nursing Home in Rusholme, Greater Manchester

Senior Investigating Officer Andy Tattersall said: ‘Due to the complex needs of those at the care home this has and continues to be an extremely difficult and protracted investigation.

‘From the outset we were determined to establish what happened to Ivan and who was responsible for causing his injuries and that remains as true today as it did then.

‘We are continuing to work closely with partner agencies in health as well as the home and I want to reassure the relatives of residents there that their welfare is, collectively between us and our partners, a top priority.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
