It is enough to send anyone diving for a bottle of chardonnay. One of the most anticipated books of the year, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy has finally arrived and has received a mauling from critics and readers alike.

'A clunking disappointment' said the Daily Telegraph, who describes the book as veering between a 'disconcerting' Fifty Shades Of Grey manner and a 'sub-Mills and Boon style'.

Bridget Jones has now become 'foolish' and unreal' while Daniel Cleaver makes just 'tantilisingly brief' appearances.

The beginning is 'toe-curling', the first two-thirds are like listening to someone who once had perfect pitch but now can't sing a note and overall the book is 'v disappointing'.

Bridget Jones is back - but the verdict on the latest book is not great

The Telegraph critic Sarah Crompton goes on to say that 'every line feels full of effort,' and that Fielding is on 'well-trodden territory', adding: 'If she is about to enter the fray, she had better have something original to say.'

Bridget Jones: Mad about the Boy doesn't fare much better with the Sunday Times newspaper either.

Sadly, there's no happy-ever-after for Mark Darcy and Bridget Jones

'It isn't just the style that jars,' 
wrote its reviewer Christina Patterson, 'the random capital letters, the
subjectless sentences, the mannerisms that now seem awfully tired.

'It isn't just the rather hysterical tone. It isn't even the pile-up of
clichés: the room that "looked like a bomb had hit it" or the stare 
"like a rabbit caught in the headlights".

'Or the fact that Fielding will never just
give two or three examples — of funny self-help books, of children's 
names that sound like Latin declensions — when she can give 10. It's the
fact that I hardly believed a word of it.'

It get worse: Patterson says the book is 'deeply uneven' as well as emotionally inauthentic and a brand which has 'lost its shine.'

The Guardian's Justine Jordan was slightly kinder, saying that the book 'reads less like a satire on modern life and more like a good old Jilly Cooper' and adding: 'While the anxiety of the urban singleton was a fresh subject for comedy in the 90s, we've been reading this sort of thing for years.'

She's back! Older, none the wiser and with some very odd dating advice for the newly single: Helen Fielding interviews Bridget Jones

The verdict from readers wasn't much better.

Fans of the previous two books - and the wildly successful films starring Renee Zellewegger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth - were already reeling from the news that the gorgeous Mark Darcy had been killed off by Bridget Jones author Helen Fielding, leaving Bridget once again out looking for love.

Fans took to Twitter to express their shock and sorrow about Mark Darcy's demise

After the news of Darcy's demise broke, one contributor to the book reviews website Goodreads wrote: 'After the revelations by author Helen Fielding this weekend, I won't be reading this or any other new HF book ever again. I have been so excited about hearing what Bridget has been up to and to hear that HF has destroyed the story of Bridget Jones and shown such a lack of respect to fans is just unbelievable!!'

Another wrote: 'Mr Darcy is dead?! I hate it! Toyboy for Bridget. Ridiculous!' while another disappointed fan wrote: 'I am no longer interested in reading this book.'

One Bridget Jones book too many? Out this Thursday, Mad About The Boy is already at the top of the bestseller's list on Amazon, despite poor reviews RIGHT: Helen Fielding was at the forefront of the chick lit movement when she released the original Bridget Jones book in 1997

The opening chapters of Bridget Jones: Mad about the boy, serialised in a Sunday newspaper last week, made for rather depressing reading. Not merely because Mark Darcy - the stiff but smouldering human rights lawyer who had captured Bridget's heart (along with several million others) in the previous books - was no more, but because this meant that our heroine had to go back on the dating scene. Again. Haven't we been here before?

Bridget Jones' Diary was all about how hapless singleton Bridget battled with her weight, her embarrassing relatives and her 'smug married' friends - not to mention her irrational dislike for Mr Darcy - to finally find love, having gone off on a enjoyable but then heart-breaking diversion with serial cheat Daniel Cleaver.

The second book, Edge of Reason, saw Bridget completely mess up her relationship with Mark and rather improbably imprisoned briefly in Thailand. Even then the comic touch that had been so brilliant in the first book - and the original newspaper columns where Bridget first appeared - showed signs of fading. How many more times could Bridget be hapless, clueless and loveless without it getting rather repetitive?

But here she is again, on her own, summoning up the energy to go out on the pull once again. It's all here, the reluctant dressing up, the fish-out-of-water feeling in the latest trendy nightclub, the encouraging but dippy friends as they prod, poke and cajole Bridget to get out there and strut her stuff.

How much more fun would it have been to have a glimpse of Bridget and Mark's married life? The romance of the newlyweds (Bridget organising her wedding would have had great comic potential - would she have turned into a Bridezilla or just so relieved to have made it out of singledom she would have spent her entire day trying to get her still-single friends to get together?) making way to happy - or otherwise - domesticity.

Would they argue over who loaded the dishwasher, whether to pay for their children's education, whether Mark Darcy worked too much or whether to watch Strictly or X Factor? Or would they take off around the world having fabulous adventures and giving us yet another chapter in such a popular romance? We will never know. So we are left with Bridget still being single, Daniel still talking about Bridget's big pants and a huge Darcy-shaped hole in all of our lives.

Last week Helen Fielding, 55, told Vogue magazine that her latest Bridget Jones Diary reflects how real life does not always have happy endings.

She said that the death of her father in a car crash made her realise that life has many 'twists and turns'.

'It's like the keys of a piano isn't it?,' she said. 'There are white notes and black notes.

'And there's a tragicomic element in my writing; the happy ending is just where you choose to end a book.

Life, with all its twists and turns, carries on beyond it.'

Whatever the critics say, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy will be a massive bestseller, already sitting near the top of Amazon's charts even though the title is not released until Thursday. But having read the reviews, Fielding could be forgiven for wondering whether it might be time to say goodbye to her most famous creation.

Sarah Crompton, The Daily Telegraph

The news that Helen Fielding was bringing back Bridget after a 14–year 
silence created a real sense of anticipation: but Mad About the Boy is a
clunking disappointment.

The tone is all wrong. Reading the first two thirds of Mad About the 
Boy is like listening to someone who once had perfect pitch, but now 
can't sing a note. It lies as flat on the page as its heroine's 
overcooked spaghetti.

You feel the weight of that worry as Fielding
takes the staples of modern life – remote controls, tweeting, texting, 
online dating – and strains to make anything of them.

Christina Patterson, The Sunday Times

It
isn't just the style that jars: the random capital letters, the 
subjectless sentences, the mannerisms that now seem awfully tired. It 
isn't just the rather hysterical tone. It isn't even the pile-up of 
clichés: the room that "looked like a bomb had hit it" or the stare 
"like a rabbit caught in the headlights". Or the fact that Fielding will
never just give two or three examples — of funny self-help books, of 
children's names that sound like Latin declensions — when she can give 
10.

It's the fact that I hardly believed a word of it. I didn't believe 
that a 51-year-old woman would tot up the number of minutes she'd spent 
on Twitter, and spend meetings about her own film script sending saucy 
texts.

Justine Jordan, The Guardian

While the anxiety of the urban singleton was a fresh subject for comedy
in the 90s, we've been reading this sort of thing for years, in 
countless slummy-mummy columns and books by Allison Pearson or Gill 
Hornby (all influenced, of course, by Fielding herself).

There's a 
beautifully judged scene where Bridget is pierced with ridiculous 
overwhelming love for her children, even as they poo and puke in the 
grip of illness, but mostly the crushed rice cakes, lost car keys and 
melon balls for the sports day picnic have been done to death.
