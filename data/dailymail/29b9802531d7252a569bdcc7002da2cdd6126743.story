A court ruling has stated that fingerprints are not protected by the Fifth Amendment, which could mean police can access devices such as iPads and iPhones more easily through their touch ID.

The decision in Virginia by Judge Steven C. Fucci stated that defendants do not have to give up passcodes or pin numbers to access personal devices.

However, they will be required to open fingerprint operated gadgets, according to the Virginia Pilot. 

The by Virginia Judge Steven C. Fucci stated that defendants do not have to give up pass-codes or pin numbers to access personal devices - but may have to give up fingerprints to operate devices such as iPhones

The Fifth Amendment states that 'no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,'.

This protects memorized information like passwords and passcodes, but it does not extend to fingerprints in the eyes of the law

The ruling is believed to have stemmed from a case involving David Baust who allegedly strangled his girlfriend. 

Prosecutors believed Baust may have stored video of the attack on his phone, and requested that the judge force him to unlock it. 

If protected by a passcode, Baust will not be required to unlock his phone under the Fifth Amendment, but if protected with a fingerprint, he could potentially be forced to unlock the device. 

Macie Pridgen, a spokeswoman for the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office, said prosecutors still are considering whether to appeal.
