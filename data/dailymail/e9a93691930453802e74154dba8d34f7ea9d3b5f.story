Just weeks ago it was revealed the infamous Bondi hoarders' house - dubbed Australia's most squalid - was being sold by the NSW Sheriff's Office to recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on clearing the mountains of rubbish collected on the property.

But in a new twist the owners have reportedly come up with the $180,000 owed for cleaning fees over the many years the house has been piled full of rubbish.

It had been listed for auction at 7.30pm on Tuesday evening to recuperate the copious amounts of money spent of legal fees and maintenance, but the Bobolas family have found the cash to stop it going ahead, Nine News reported.

The family, consisting of mother Mary Bobolas and her daughters Elena and Liana, now have 24 hours to produce the funds.

After amassing an enormous debt to the local council, the notorious Bobolas family  are being forced to sell their garbage-strewn property

But now it has been revealed the Bobolas family, consisiting of Mary and her daughters Elena and Liana (pictured in April) have come up with $180,000 to cover the costs of legal and cleaning fees

Amazingly, the house is expected to go under the hammer for about $2 million, however the new owner will be required to apply for a court order to evict the family

In January it emerged that whoever buys the free-standing home at 19 Boonara Avenue in Bondi, just a few hundred metres from the world famous beach - may also have to pay to evict the current owners, who have previously refused to clear up the junk or move out to allow council inspectors inside.

Debt collectors, on behalf of Waverley Council, arranged to sell the home - which remarkably could fetch at least $2 million in the hope of recovering the $180,000 the Bobolas family owes for the clean up costs.

The new owners will have to apply for to the Supreme Court for a writ of possession to evict them, which can take four weeks, according to The Daily Telegraph.

A spokesperson for Justice NSW said 'after the sheriff receives the writ, they give the occupants 30 days to vacate the premises. If they do not vacate willingly, the sheriff has the power to force an eviction.' 

Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news. 'I can't believe it. We have just bought a house here and moved in on Saturday. That's fantastic for the whole street,' Yael Super told The Daily Telegraph. 

If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house, but otherwise the family will be given the remainder of the profits after the debts have been cleared 

The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets' 

The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard

The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets'.

The 550sqm block of land, which is within walking distance to the beach, 'offers plenty of scope to build you dream home (subject to council approval),' according to the real estate's advertisement. 

The estimated price range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data. 

Waverley Council have set a date to demolish the garage and remove the piles of garbage that surround the house. The Bobolas have resisted all offers to connect them with support services, and adamantly defended council clean-ups in court.

The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard.

More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property. 

With empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture piled high outside the home, it has not been lived in by its occupants for years.

The property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home.

The council cleaned the property in mid-2014, but some neighbours said the house was as bad as they'd ever seen it, describing it as 'sickening' and 'filth'.

Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity.
