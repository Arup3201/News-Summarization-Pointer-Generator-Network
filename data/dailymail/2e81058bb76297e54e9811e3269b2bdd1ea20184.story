Coronation Street actor Bill Roache arrives at Preston Magistrates' Court where he is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl

The waiting photographers, chauffeur-driven black Mercedes and clutch of eager fans suggested a star was on the way.

And when Bill Roache arrived at court yesterday, it seemed he was determined to keep playing the part of a celebrity.

The Coronation Street actor, who was 
flanked by two minders, even signed a few autographs outside court room 
number three at Preston magistrates court.

But once inside the wood-panelled room, Roache, 81, was simply the accused.

He sat behind the lawyers until his case, the first on the morning list, was called. 

It was the first time he has appeared in court since being charged earlier this month with raping a 15-year-old girl in 1967.

When the hearing began, he was told 
by a clerk to stand in the dock, from where he confirmed his full name 
as William Patrick Roache, his home address in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and 
his date of birth as April 25, 1932.

He was then allowed to sit as Joanna 
White, prosecuting, told the court he was ‘charged with two allegations 
of rape which date back to 1967’.

Miss White, who did not outline the 
details, added: ‘These are matters that can only be dealt with at the 
Crown Court. It’s not an early guilty plea matter.’

No plea was entered during yesterday’s
hearing. But in a statement issued earlier this month Roache, who plays
Ken Barlow in Coronation Street, strenuously denied the allegations.

Yesterday District Judge Jane Goodwin sent the case to Preston Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on June 10.

She granted Roache bail on condition 
that he lives at his home or at a relative’s address in London, has no 
unsupervised access to anyone under 16 and does not approach two named 
witnesses.

The 81-year-old, who has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, arrived at Preston Magistrates Court today to face two counts of rape against his alleged victim in 1967

The judge warned Roache that he risks 
being arrested if he breaches any of the conditions. When she asked if 
he understood this, he replied: ‘I do understand, yes.’

After the seven-minute hearing Roache 
told his solicitor he had struggled to hear the proceedings despite 
being only a few feet from the judge.

He made no comment  as he walked 
to his car outside, despite being besieged camera crews and reporters outside the court.

Roache has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch.

In a statement issued earlier this month, he said he was 'astounded and deeply horrified by the extraordinary events' of his arrest and subsequent charging.

He added: 'I strenuously deny the 
allegations and will now focus my full attention on fighting to preserve
my innocence in the challenging times ahead.

'I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all those people who have offered me their support and good wishes at this difficult time.'

Roache - the world’s longest-serving soap actor - will not appear in the programme until legal proceedings are concluded, ITV said.

He collected an award from Guinness World Records in 2010 for his long service in Coronation Street, having joined in 1960 and appeared regularly ever since.

Fellow Coronation Street star Michael
Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air 
after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including 
rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

He denies the charges, which are not linked to Roache.

Roache’s marriage to his first wife, Anna, ended in divorce in 1974. His second wife Sara died in 2009.

Earlier this year it was revealed he 
ended his two-year relationship with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, 44, so 
he could explore a ‘mystic message of love’ linked to his membership of 
the Pure Love Movement, a religious group.
