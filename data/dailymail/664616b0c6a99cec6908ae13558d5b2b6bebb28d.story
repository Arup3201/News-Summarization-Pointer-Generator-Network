A mentally ill man suspected of burning down his neighborhood's adult film store to eradicate porn is being charged with arson.

Mitchell Hapner, 41, worked as a hair dresser about a mile from Hollywood Nights before it was completely gutted by a fire on Wednesday afternoon.

Police say that he told them he was trying to 'eradicate' porn.

Mitchell Hapner, 41, is charged with burning down the Hollywood Nights sex shop in Kalamazoo, Michigan and said that he wanted to 'eradicate' porn in his neighborhood

A man with an axe, thought to be Hapner, was seen leaving the building during the fire.

Hapner, who is also charged with fleeing police, admitted to police that he was behind the blaze, according to MLive.com.

Witnesses of the fire reported seeing a man leave in a silver Jaguar, which police later tried to stop.

The car reached speeds of 65mph in 35mph zones before crashing into another vehicle, according to police.

Hapner's family wrote a statement Friday saying that they had been trying to get help for his mental illness for years, but were stopped by a broken mental health system, according to WOOD TV. 

They said they 'were saddened to learn that Mitch was responsible for the arson at Hollywood Nights, but the news did not surprise us'.

Hapner, who has previously said that he received prophecies from God, worked at a hair salon about a mile away from the Hollywood Nights store

In previous encounters with police he has said that he had received a 'prophecy from God'. 

He had been ordered to mental health treatment two years ago.

Last September he said that he backed a car into his father's house because he was acting on 'God's word' and was ordered to treatment for 90 days. 

At Friday's arraignment, Hapner's bond was set at $250,000 on the condition that he undergoes a mental health evaluation. 

He said he objected to the evaluation. 

Third degree arson in Michigan is punishable by up to ten years in prison. 

He is next set to appear in court on March 10. 

The owners of the store set up a GoFundMe page to help rebuild their 'family business' before the page was later disabled.

Their shop was uninsured before its roof collapsed Wednesday and they planned to raise $300,000.

No one was injured in the fire.
