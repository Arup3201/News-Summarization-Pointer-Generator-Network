The mother of Sgt. Okan Cetinbag, the soldier killed by a single gunshot wound to his face while stationed in Alaska earlier this month has accused authorities of a cover-up.

Speaking from her home in Chicago following her son's burial on Tuesday, Sevgi Yaylamis said that despite there being six army colleagues in his house the day he was shot, plus Okan's wife and young daughter, no one is telling the same story.

Saying that she is suspicious of all the colleagues and even her daughter-in-law, Yaylamis said that the Army and Department of Defense have still not released her son's autopsy and have not told when and if they will.

Resolve: Sevgi Yaylamis, believes the six colleagues of her son Sgt. Okan Cetinbag and his wife who were in the house the day he was shot are not telling the whole truth

'I would like to know what happened,' said Yaylamis to WGNTV. 

'I am suspicious of all of them. They are covering up something but I don't know what yet.'

On February 7, 25-year-old Sgt. Okan Cetinbag was shot in the face at his home on the Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson base in Alaska. He was in a coma for days and then taken off life support.

He was found unconscious by his wife, Jazzmine, on February 7 as he prepared for a rare night out with his colleagues.

He was rushed to hospital in Anchorage where he remained in a coma until the decision was taken to remove him from life support systems.

Yaylamis says that she will not stop until she finds the truth behind his death.

'Hopefully in the end we will have what i am looking for. Hopefully someone will be held responsible.

'He was the love of my life. My son was the love of my life.'

Special agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command are probing the circumstances of his unexplained death.

An Army spokesman declined to say whether foul play was involved, citing the investigation.

‘Details of the injuries Cetinbag 
sustained at his home and the cause and manner of death are not being 
released at this time to protect the integrity of the investigative 
process,’ read an official statement from officials.

The
 Tribune reports that Cetinbag had kissed his wife and 2-year-old 
daughter Abbey Laine goodbye and gone downstairs to prepare to leave for
 his night out when they discovered him shot.

A native of Morton Grove, Illinois, 
Cetinbag joined the Army in January 2013 and attended basic and airborne
 training at Fort Benning, Ga. He arrived in Alaska in June 2013.

He previously served with the U.S. Marine Corps, including a 2010 combat tour in Afghanistan, officials said.

Cetinbag and his wife had been at Alaska's Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson since mid-2013, she said in an interview earlier this month with the Chicago Tribune.

His family said it was his dream assignment and he was obsessed with the state which he referred to as American's 'Last Frontier'.

Cetinbag began his military service with the US Marin Corps in 2007 and met his wife when she 17 at a welcoming home party.

'He was just the most handsome man I had ever seen in my whole life,' said Jazzmine Cetinbag, 24 to the Chicago Tribune.

'I instantly fell in love with him.'

The pair married in 2009 and when his service with the Marines ended in 2011 the couple moved to Chicago and had their daughter, who they named Abbey Laine in honor of Cetinbag's favorite band, The Beatles.

But civilian life didn't suit him, his wife said, and he signed up for the Army about a year later.

'His place in life was in the military,' she said. 'He's so good at what he does. He just knew that's where he was supposed to be. His job was to serve his country and take care of his family.'
