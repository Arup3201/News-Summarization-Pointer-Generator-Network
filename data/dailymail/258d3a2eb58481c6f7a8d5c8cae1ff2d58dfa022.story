A teen has been accused of murdering an eight-year-old Virginia boy who was trying to protect his older sister from being raped.

Mairese Washington, 16, was charged Monday with second-degree murder and malicious wounding and strangulation in the May 1 death of Martin Cobb, court records showed.

Washington will be tried as an adult in the case and has a prior violent criminal record, WTVR reported. The Richmond teen was arrested two days after the killing but not immediately identified because he is a minor.

Hero: 8-year-old Marty Cobb, pictured, reportedly was killed while trying to fight off a 16-year-old boy from raping his 12-year-old sister

Documents from an unrelated 2010 case showed that Washington previously was charged with malicious wounding after attacking a three-year-old boy with a hammer, according to the station.

The baby survived, according to WWBT, but family told the station they are 'shocked' he was able to attack another young child.

'It brings chills to my spine. It makes the hairs on the back of my neck standup,' said the previously attacked boy's mother, Heather Arrington. 'It's just something you don't want to go through.'

It was only in June that a judge decided Washington would be charged as an adult, which allowed media to publicly identify him.

His indictment comes almost two months to the day after the heroic Cobb was buried in a somber funeral.

The young boy was reportedly buried in a new 
suit, along with a bag of potato chips and a teddy bear, WTVR says.

It was packed with rows of mourners, and purple and white flowers near the young boy's casket, footage from WWBT showed.

The
 12-year-old sister that Cobb died trying to protect was unable to come 
to her brother's funeral - and has not been back to her home since the 
assault because of her case with the Department of Social Services, 
according to an earlier report by the station.

'She
 ain't going to be able to come to her brother's funeral,' mother 
Sharain Spruill told the station on Thursday. 'That's wrong.'

Mommy's hero: Sharain Spruill (left), whose daughter was allegedly raped and her son Marty Cobb (right) killed last week (shown here at a May 3 vigil) revealed that the suspect initially told her that a white man was to blame for the attacks

Cobb's actions were even praised on Capitol Hill by Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA).

'At
 8 years old, he may have been small in stature, some say he looked no 
older than 4 or 5, but in his last moments, Martin showed he was a 
bigger man than most men ever dream to be,' he said, according to NBC12.

Spruill earlier revealed more horrific details of the night she lost her brave boy.

She recounted
 the horrifying moment on May 1 when a 16-year-old boy carried her 
bloody daughter, 12, to her home claiming she and little Marty Cobb had 
been attacked by a white man.

But
 it was that same boy, whose name has not been released, who's now been 
formally charged with strangling Marty and beating him to death, 
possibly with a brick.

The horrifying details came as Spruill addressed reporters and community members outside the Richmond house Marty once called home and described her daughter's horrified tears as she revealed the boy was dead.

Family and friends say are hailing Martin as a hero, saying he tried to protect his big sister.

'As
 soon as he could talk, I told (him) he's the man of the house. That's 
what he did. He's a hero,' his mother told The Associated Press. 'I told
 him he's the man of the house.'

His
 mother, sitting on the front steps of her home, said her son was a 
second grader and 'a mama's boy' who didn't talk much to other people. 
His tiny stature masked a fighting spirit, she said.

A
 few feet away in the front yard, a memorial carried that message, 
saying in part: 'A Real Hero Lived, Fought and Died Here.'The wooden 
sign was draped with the boy's parka, surrounded by stuffed animals and 
toys.

His mother said her son had open-heart surgery when he was 3 months old and doctors said he wasn't going to make it.

Neighbor Andrew Patillo, said the boy looked more like he was 4 or 5 years old.

'He had a big heart to be that small,' said Patillo.Â 

She said she was sitting outside her 
Richmond home when a 16-year-old neighbor walked into the front
 yard carrying her daughter, weeping and wearing only a T-shirt, on his 
back. The teenager, who is black, told her a white man had attacked the 
girl.

The girl also initially blamed a white man and said he had raped her.

The boy then soon appeared at an initial court hearing in which a judge deemed he would remain in custody.

He was later identified as Washington.

Authorities
 said he intimidated and threatened the girl and she initially gave 
authorities the wrong description of her attacker.

Pitchford described Cobb as warm-hearted and friendly and said he was often playing with his sister outside.

'I'm proud of him. I'm proud that he stuck up for his sister. He did what he was taught,' she said.

Pastor
 Dr. Theodore L. Hughey of the Abundant Life church said the boy, also 
known as 'Marty' and 'Little Martin,'and his sister were inseparable and
 'always in and out' of the church.

'You saw one. The other was there. They were never apart,' Hughey said.

'He had a heart of a lion,' said neighbor Andrew Patillo. 'He stood so tall, to be so small.'

Before the vigil began, loved ones gathered around a sign in Martin's yard near the church.

'Martin: A real hero lived, fought and died here,' the sign said.
