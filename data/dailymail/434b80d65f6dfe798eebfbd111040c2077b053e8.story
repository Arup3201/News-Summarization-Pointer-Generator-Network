Margaret Thatcher was marked out by American diplomats as a ‘quintessential suburban matron, and frightfully English to boot,’ previously censored documents reveal today.

The observations, made in 1975 when the future Prime Minister became leader of the Conservative Opposition, have coincidentally been made public on the day of her death.

The words were written by US diplomatic staff based in London and passed on to Washington DC. They illustrate how the Americans viewed the then plain Mrs Thatcher as a kind of novelty figure.

Report: The documents published by WikiLeaks show American diplomats viewed Margaret Thatcher as 'quintessentially English'

Friends: The papers described Mrs Thatcher (seen here following her election as prime minister with US president Ronald Reagan) as having a 'plummy' English accent

It is contained in a cable stored in 
US archives which reads: ‘Her conventional and somewhat forced charm, 
and above all her plummy voice stamp her as the quintessential suburban 
matron, and frightfully English to boot.

'None of this goes down well with the working class of England (one-third of which used to vote Conservative), to say nothing of all classes in the Celtic Fringes of this island.’

Four years later she was swept to power in the 1979 General Election, and went on to become one of American president Ronald Reagan’s greatest allies.

The Thatcher cable is one of some 240,000 records from 1973 to 1976 which were sent from or to London and cover a range of diplomatic developments.

Released by WikiLeaks , they are mostly sensitive documents amassed in the US national archives which have recently been declassified.

Revealing: The declassified documents showed diplomats felt Mrs Thatcher's 'plummy' English accent did not go down well with working class voters

WikiLeaks described the Public Library of US Diplomacy (PlusD) as the world's largest searchable collection of U.S. confidential, or formerly confidential, diplomatic communications.

Much of the work was carried out by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, 41, during his time in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been staying since last summer.

The Australian sought refuge at the embassy last June over fears that he would be sent to the U.S. if he was extradited to Sweden to face sexual offence claims by two women - charges he denies.

Early Days: The Queen talks with Prime Minister Thatcher in Zambia in 1979. As prime minister she would go on to radically change Britain during her time in office

Leader: Mrs Thatcher's reputation in America was very different by the end of her time in office - after she had transformed Britain's economic fortunes and led the nation to victory in the Falklands War

Baroness Thatcher suffered acute short-term memory loss and had a series of strokes over a decade. She spent 11 years in Downing Street, the longest run by any 20th century prime minister.

Margaret Thatcher came to power in May 1979, at the end of the infamous Winter of Discontent, where Britain was crippled by a wave of national strikes.

She spent the next decade curbing the power of trade unions, signalling the end of an era when trade union leaders trooped in and out of 10 Downing Street, haggling and bargaining with her Labour predecessors.

Instead she stripped the unions of 
many of their powers with the aim of transferring them to managements 
and individual consumers.

Mrs
 Thatcher successfully defied Arthur Scargill's nationwide and year-long
 miners' strike, which threatened to cripple Britain's entire economic 
base.

And as she transformed the nation - attempting to release the grip of the state on massive industries and public services alike - she became one of the most influential, talked-about, listened-to and dominant statesmen of the Western world.
