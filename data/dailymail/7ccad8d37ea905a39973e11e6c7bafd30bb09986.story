A thief was caught on CCTV as he stole a charity collection tin full of cash while collecting a parcel from his local food bank.

David Hindmarch was filmed as he took the money from a community cafe in Hartlepool, County Durham, where he was picking up a free box of food donated by volunteers.  

The 36-year-old was arrested after charity workers spotted him on security footage sliding the tin into his coat. He was given a suspended jail sentence last week after he pleaded guilty to the theft.

Target: Cafe One77, where the money was stolen. He took around £70 that was being collected for Hartlepool Families First, a charity that supports vulnerable families and young people, according to charity bosses

The CCTV footage shows Hindmarch, from Hartlepool, dressed in a hooded jumper and hat, approaching the counter and looking around the cafe before sliding the tin inside his coat.

He took around £70 that was being collected for Hartlepool Families First, a charity that supports vulnerable families and young people, according to charity bosses.

Volunteers from the organisation spotted the tin was missing and spotted Hindmarch stealing the collection tin after looking at the security footage.

Officers tracked him down and he was given an eight-week jail term, suspended for 12 months, at Hartlepool Magistrates' Court last Wednesday.

Speaking after the court case, family charity manager Paul Thompson slammed the thief and said his actions were 'a real kick in the teeth'.

He said: 'There was a strong sense of anger within the team. We rely on donations from members of the public and for someone to take some of those donations is just awful.

'This particular can had mainly been filled by elderly people who come in for a free lunch group that we've been running.

'They struggle financially but always want to make a contribution and to say thank you.

'It's just a real kick in the teeth and the lowest form of theft.'

Staff said Hindmarch went into Cafe One77 in Hartlepool to collect a parcel from charity group Paradox, who were handing out food on January 31.

The cafe is also used by Hartlepool Families First, which helps residents living in disadvantaged areas - including children and young people with disabilities.

CCTV shows Hindmarsh check nobody was looking before pocketing donations made to the charity by users.

Mr Thompson added: 'We looked back through the CCTV and caught this nice fellow helping himself to the charity collection tin.

'We're going to have to anchor the tin to the counter now, so it will have to be unlocked before it can be removed.

'It's sad when you have to do that because chains kind of send out a bad feeling - but that's what we're going to have to do now.'

Hindmarch pleaded guilty to the theft, was given an eight-week jail term suspended for 12 months, ordered to pay £50 compensation, £85 court costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
