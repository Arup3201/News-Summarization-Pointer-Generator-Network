Tragic mom: Lindsey Combs, 32, was crushed to death inside her car when a truck laden with gravel flipped over in her Martinez, California, driveway 

A pregnant hairstylist from California was killed Monday afternoon when a big rig carrying gravel flipped over onto her car, crushing her to death in front of her young daughter.

Lindsey Combs, 32, from Martinez, was moving her car at the request of a construction crew working near the corner of Shell Avenue and Pine Street when the gravel on the truck shifted, causing its dump trailer to flip over. 

Combs was two months pregnant with her second child and engaged to be married.

According to family members, the woman's 4-year-old daughter ran out of the house and saw her mother's car crushed by gravel. Combs' fiance, Anderson Pamilton, was also in the house at the time.

The devastating incident took place at 1pm outside 820 Shell Avenue when a truck operated by city-contracted JJR construction was bringing a load of gravel to rebuild sidewalks along Shell Avenue.

According to police, one of the workers approached Lindsey Combs in her driveway and asked her to repark her car to make room for a purple truck owned by Gregory Trucking.

The woman complied and was in the process of moving her car when the massive vehicle laden with 20 tons of gravel tipped over and smashed her car.

Eyewitness Travis Hagerty told ABC 7 News he and two construction workers rushed to Combs' aid and attempted to dig her out by hand, but it was too late.

‘A guy with a backhoe came around and ripped the door off the car with the backhoe after he picked the trailer up. That's when I looked in the car and saw she was smashed and dead,’ Hagerty said.

Cal/OSHA has launched an investigation into the cause of the fatal accident. According to the state agency, the San Mateo-based construction company was cited for a minor violation in 2010, its only citation in five years.

Anderson Pamilton, Lindsey Combs' fiance, said her death 'was totally avoidable.' He added the expectant mother was scheduled to have her very first ultrasound scan for this week, reportedSF Gate.

Friends, family and neighbors described her as a happy, bubbly woman who was excited about becoming a mother for a second time.

Back to work: the crew returned to Shell Avenue and resume work on the sidewalks less than 24 hours after Combs' death 

Combs worked as a stylist at Sport Clips Hair Salon, where her colleagues were reeling Tuesday from the news of her unexpected passing.

‘It's like a family member being tragically taken away from us,’ owner Ben Mangels told the paper.

On Tuesday, residents along Shell Avenue were outraged to see construction resume less than 24 hours after Combs' death.

Workers were back at the site just hours after all of the spilled gravel had been removed.

Full of life: Friends and family said Combs, a hairstylist, (pictured left and right) was excited about her pregnancy. She is survived by her 4-year-old daughter (pictured)  

‘We are, as a block, as a community, as a city, mourning this young mother. It's like there's no respect for the fact that she died,’ Amy Dubinsky told San Jose Mercury News.

Combs’ brother, Robert, has launched a GoFundMe campaign hoping to raise $5,000 that will be used to bring the woman’s father and uncle from Montana for her funeral.
