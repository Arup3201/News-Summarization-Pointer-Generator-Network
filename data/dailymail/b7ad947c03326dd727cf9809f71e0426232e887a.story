Struck off: Anthony Barton, pictured today, appeared before the General Dental Council in 2009 after it emerged he regularly groped nurses' bottoms and tried to undo their bras while at work

A dentist struck who slept with a teenage dental nurse at work, told another to wear a thong under her uniform, and left a third scared to come in after he groped her has been cleared to practise again.

Anthony Barton, 41, insists he has ‘grown up a lot’ since groped dental nurses' bottoms, twanged their knicker elastics and tried to undo their bras at work.

The General Dental Council nearly six years ago banned him from dentistry after it heard evidence of nearly eight years of ‘sexually motivated behaviour’ - including at work sexual liaisons with a teenage colleague.

But his name will now be returned to the GDC's register after a professional conduct and competence committee today decided to let him to resume his career. 

Announcing the decision, committee Chairman Rachel O’Connell said Mr Barton was now of good character and fit to practise - albeit with conditions for the first 12 months.

‘The Committee is in no doubt that you are remorseful and ashamed of the conduct which led to your erasure in 2009 and that you have reflected extensively over the last five years,' said Ms O'Connell.

‘You understand now how inappropriate your offensive sexual behaviour was and the impact it had on those who were subjected to it.'

Mr Barton had found work as manager of a dental practice, where he had told colleagues about his past misconduct and his disqualification from the GDC register, said Ms O'Connell.

‘You work closely with the dental team at your practice, including young female colleagues. There is no evidence of any further concern or issue raised regarding your behaviour,' she said, adding that eight female dental nurses had submitted testimonials in support of his character.

Mr Barton was in October 2009 found guilty of ‘unprofessional and inappropriate’ conduct towards a one young dental nurse and was struck off for ‘a serious breach of trust of several vulnerable employees’ at Red Rose Dental Group in Wigan, Greater Manchester.

The twice-married dentist had carried on an at-work affair with one nurse, prancing around his surgery in a leopard-print thong and meeting the 19-year-old for trysts in his office and the toilets.

The affair came to light after several dental nurses complained of unwanted touching, including one who reported that he had asked her to wear a thong beneath her uniform.

The dentist, who resigned from the practice after the allegations emerged, admitted the affair to a tribunal and was found guilty of ‘unprofessional, inappropriate and indecent’ sexual conduct towards three women between 2000 and 2008.

Since his disqualification from dentistry, Mr Barton had found work as a manager at a Smiles Dental in Anglesey, Wales. He told the panel this week he has to endure a daily 180-mile commute from his home in Warrington, Cheshire.

‘I have come to understand where my conduct fell short of what was to be expected,' he said.

‘It is quite clear to me now looking back that a lot of my actions were completely inappropriate and had no place in practise at all.

‘I have grown up a lot. I think I was very immature. I was very young at the time when certain aspects of the behaviour began.

‘It seems like a different person and I can’t believe a lot of the behaviour which happened.’

Barton said he was trusted to be around lone females at the surgery and there had been ‘no complaints at all’.

‘Often, there may just be myself and another member of staff’, he said.

Barton also discussed taking practical and online courses to keep his knowledge of dentistry up to scratch, including ‘tutorial sessions on professionalism and ethics’.

He has taken ‘90 or 100 hours’ of instruction and has even practised on dummy heads, since he is not allowed to work with real patients.

‘After an hour or two of doing it, it started to feel very natural’, he commented.

Affair: Twice-married Barton also had a relationship with one 19-year-old trainee and the pair would have sex in the toilets and in his office at the Red Rose Dental Group in Wigan, Greater Manchester, pictured

Gabriel Beeby, for the GDC, had introduced the case, saying Mr Barton ‘had been unprofessional, inappropriate and participated in sexualised conduct towards four dental nurses with whom he worked’.

After a five-day misconduct hearing, he was in 2009 found guilty of 17 charges relating to his treatment of the women.

One victim, known only as Ms D, told the hearing of her disgust when his sexual innuendos took a physical twist and he began to ‘gratuitously grope’ her bottom in the office.

She told the hearing: ‘I remember my trousers fell down a bit so I pulled them up myself. Mr Barton was standing behind me and thought that was a good opportunity to feel my bottom.

‘I think that’s the day he said I had a nice a***.’

Mr Barton admitted having a six-month affair with dental nurse Ms B and was found guilty of having sex with her during surgery hours.

He was found guilty of multiple allegations of touching Ms A, Ms C and Ms D, and that his behaviour was ‘unprofessional, inappropriate and indecent.’
