A judge declared a mistrial in a murder trial Wednesday after a newspaper reporter tweeted a photo that included the grainy profile of a juror.

The picture, taken and tweeted by Topeka Capital-Journal reporter Ann Marie Bush, includes the profile of a juror set against a brightly lit window.

Austin Tabor, 20, was on trial in conjunction with a 2010 shooting that left one man dead and another wounded.

Mea culpa: Topeka Capital-Journal reporter Ann Marie Bush caused a mistrial in a murder case by tweeting a grainy photo of a juror

To tweet or not to tweet: This photo shows a grainy profile of one of the jurors in the Austin Tabor trial

The photo in question is no longer in
Ms Bush’s Twitter feed, though several others from the Tabor trial, 
including many from where she was sitting in the gallery.

She was live-tweeting Wednesday’s proceedings.

The Shawnee County district attorney's office in Kansas said it plans to reschedule Tabor's trial for June or July after the abrupt halt to proceedings in Topeka one day after attorneys presented opening statements.

'One of the photos apparently showed one or more of the jurors,' Lee McGowan, spokesman for the district attorney's office, told the Associated Press.

'It was brought to the court's attention and ultimately a mistrial was declared.'

The trial: Austin Tabor, 20, was on trial for first-degree murder he allegedly committed in 2010

According to McGowan, the judge had agreed to allow camera phones in the courtroom, but said no photos were to be taken of jurors. 

Capital-Journal managing editor Tomari Quinn responded to comments on the newspaper's website by saying the photo was a mistake and the 'reporter is miserable about it.'

'The juror was seated next to a window and, on the reporter's smartphone, wasn't seen against the incoming light,' Quinn wrote.

Publisher Gregg Ireland said the reporter was aware of the rules.

'The Capital-Journal regrets the error and loss of the court's time,' he said. 'We will use this as a training opportunity for our staff members as they strive to bring information to our readers in digital and print media.'

That corresponds with rules established by the Kansas Supreme Court for cameras in courtrooms, including that individual jurors are not to be photographed.

'In courtrooms where photography is impossible without including the jury as part of the unavoidable background, the photography is permitted, but close-ups which identify individual jurors are not permitted,' the court said.

A hearing to reschedule the trial is set for Thursday.

Tabor is accused of shooting and killing 20-year-old Matthew Mitchell near Topeka West High School on October 23, 2010 and is charged with felony first-degree murder, as well as conspiracy to sell marijuana within 1,000 feet of a school zone.

The Capital-Journal guessed that the trial would last perhaps five to six days.

Mr Mitchell’s cousin, Houston James, told the Capital-Journal that the news was disappointing.

‘I’ve been waiting for this day about two years,’ he said. ‘It was going straight smoothly until today.’

Mr James was slated to testify in the trial.
