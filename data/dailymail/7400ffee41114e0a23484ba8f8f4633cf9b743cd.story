Academy flanker Max Northcote-Green scored two tries on his debut as Bath brushed aside an experimental London Welsh side to get their LV=Cup campaign off to a flying start.

Gavin Henson converted three of his side’s seven tries and kicked two penalties in a 47-7 success.

It was very much back to ‘bread and butter’ rugby after the visit from the aristocrats of Toulouse and the circus surrounding Sam Burgess’s arrival in midweek - but more than 13,000 again crammed into the Recreation Ground in perfect autumn weather.

Sale Sharks got campaign off to an ideal start as Nick Macleod’s late penalty snatched a dramatic 32-29 triumph over Wasps at the AJ Bell Stadium.

Tries from Will Rowlands and Will Helu (two) gave Dai Young’s team a 19-17 advantage at the interval, with Sale responding through touchdowns from Alberto de Marchi and Josh Beaumont, as well as Joe Ford’s penalty.

The Sharks went ahead in the second period through Viliami Fihaki and Charlie Ingall scores before the visitors levelled matters courtesy of an Ed Jackson try and Alex Lozowski’s three-pointer, but Macleod was on target in the 77th minute to give the hosts the victory. 

Robert Barbieri of Leicester Tigers breaks away to score a try against London Irish

Leicester grabbed a hard-fought 17-16 victory over London Irish at the Madejski Stadium.

The Tigers were second best in terms of territory and possession for much of the match, but they took their chances to secure the win.

Miles Benjamin and Robert Barbieri scored their two tries, with Tommy Bell converting both and kicking a penalty.

Irish will wonder how they lost, such was their superiority, but they lacked the control to break down a stubborn Leicester defence. It was not until the 75th minute that they scored their only try through Guy Armitage, and had to rely on three penalties and a conversion from Myles Dorrian for the rest of their points.

Northampton made a powerful start to their cup quest with a resounding 37-23 victory over Newcastle Falcons at Franklin’s Gardens.

Two Tries from Tom Collins, Teimana Harrison, Mike Haywood and Howard Packman secured the win for Saints while fly-half Will Hooley contributed two penalties and three conversions.

Newcastle posted tries through Tom Catterick and substitute Juan Pablo Socino while the flawless kicking of Rory Clegg kept the Falcons in the contest. 

A last minute penalty try converted by fly-half Ceri Sweeney saw  holders Exeter snatch a 28-27 victory over West Country rivals Gloucester at Sandy Park in a match that was littered with penalties.
