London's department stores are bracing themselves for a 'Middle Eastern gold rush' as scores of rich Arab shoppers are expected to hit the tills in what has become known as the 'Ramadan rush'.

Middle Eastern shoppers are expected to increase their summer spend by a quarter over the next three days on a quest to 'out-shop and outspend' each other as Eid al Fitr celebrations - which mark the end of the 29-day fasting period of Ramadan - begin.

Around 69 per cent of the total Middle Eastern spend in August 2013 was in major department and clothing stores, like Harrods and Selfridges.

Middle Eastern visitors spent an average of £152.40 per transaction in August last year with many of the purchases being made at high-end department stores like Selfridges, above, which specialise in luxury brands

Figures from Worldpay show that Middle Eastern visitors spent an average of £152.40 per transaction in August 2013 with visitors from Qatar topping the list by handing over an average of £288.17 on each trip to the till.

Shoppers from Saudi Arabia were next, spending £199.87, followed by those from Bahrain, £189.29, and those from the United Arab Emirates, £188.29.

In comparison, European tourists spent just £49.00 per sale during the same period. American shoppers spent slightly more at £65.41.

Worldpay said given the number of visitors from Gulf Cooperation Council countries had jumped by 11 per cent between January and April  - compared to the same period last year - retailers needed to be well prepared.

Tourists from the UAE led the charge with 262,000 visitors in 2013, with Kuwait in second place with 110,000 visitors.

Qatar shoppers - £288.17 each purchase

Saudi Arabia  - £199.87 each purchase

Bahrain shoppers - £189.29 each purchase

UAE shoppers - £188.29 each purchase

U.S shoppers - £65.41 each purchase

European shoppers - £49 each purchase

Dave Hobday, Worldpay UK managing director, said Britain has some of the best shopping in the world but retailers needed to 'wake up' to the fact that the biggest spenders were not British.

He said: 'There’s a Middle Eastern gold rush underway and millions of pounds are at stake as tourists from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE flock to the UK to out-shop and outspend the rest.'

Mr Hobday said the 'pressure' was on retailers to go beyond simply offering great service.

He said: 'Winning retailers must work harder than ever to make Middle Eastern shoppers welcome.'

High-end retailers and boutiques are now employing multi-lingual staff and giving shoppers the option to pay by card in their own currency, Mr Hobday said.

'We’re on the eve of Eid and this spending frenzy is a gift retailers just can’t afford to miss.'
