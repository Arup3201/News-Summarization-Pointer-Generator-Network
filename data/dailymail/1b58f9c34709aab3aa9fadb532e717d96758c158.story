U.S. Army Cadets pride themselves on 'discipline, dedication, motivation and physical fitness' - so for many of them, this video will not make easy viewing.

After entering a push-up competition to raise funds for the Active Heroes Foundation, a burly-looking cadet was to put to shame by a small, slender female challenger.

In the one minute clip, the determined girl, wearing a white top and cropped blue leggings, annihilates the favourite, beating his total by a considerable amount.

At several points, the cadet stops to catch his breath and look to his comrades in disbelief as the indefatigable young woman, believed to be Junior Olympics hopeful, Kaylyn Mintz, persists on.

As the crowd cheers the girl to victory, the loser can be heard saying 'oh my God'.

At the end of the bout, the man can only look on in admiration as his pony-tail sporting opponent attempts to record a final few push-ups. 

The score ended with the girl achieving roughly 84 push-ups, with the cadet scoring around 54. 

On the U.S. Army Cadet website, it reads: 'The Army Cadets, Inc. achieves its goals through military discipline, dedication, motivation'.

They may now wish to get some training tips from the formidable female challenger that put one of their own to shame. 

The event took place on Saturday at the Independence Mall in Wilmington, North Carolina, at a Stand At Attention charity competition organized by Active Heroes, a charity that raises money for military families.
