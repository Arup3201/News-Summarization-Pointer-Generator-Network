Benefits Street star White Dee believes she could become a millionaire by next year and is expected to return for a second trip to Majorca – with a mystery boyfriend.

The Department for Work and Pensions has reportedly frozen the reality TV star's £101 a week sickness benefit after she started cashing in on her growing celebrity status.

But the Birmingham mother is said to be lining up a number of ways to make more than a million pounds by 2015 through a new autobiography and by appearing on television shows.

The 42-year-old, real name Deirdre Kelly, angered taxpayers recently when she was pictured on a jolly to Magaluf where she was she seen downing pints, shots and champagne.

Now it has emerged that she could return to the sun-kissed island, paid for by the organisers of the same Carnage Magaluf pub crawl and pool party she attended.

Organisers will also pay for the mother-of-two’s new boyfriend to attend, according to The Sun, which quotes Alan Collinson from Carnage as saying: ‘People who are on benefits should be entitled to go on holiday as well, especially if it’s free.’

Meanwhile, there are also rumours that Miss Kelly is being lined up to appear on Celebrity Big Brother.

Her agent, Barry Tomes told The Daily Star that she could become a millionaire – if she can overcome her depression.

‘By Christmas I would estimate she could make about £100,000,’ he is reported as saying.

‘By 2015 she could earn £500,000 if she’s well enough. And she could even become a millionaire.’

He has previously refused to confirm whether her benefits have been cut but accused the DWP of being 'inefficient and ineffective' in dealing with her changing circumstances.

Mr Tomes said it was possible Miss Kelly's benefits had been cut temporarily due to her income rising from one-off media appearances, but the state payments could resume if her earnings drop again.

But he threatened legal action against the government if it emerges the DWP has released any of Ms Kelly's personal details to the media.

Miss Kelly, whose handouts equate to the take-home pay of someone earning £20,000 a year, was getting £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance – formerly known as Sickness Benefit – Child Tax Credit and Child Benefit, plus £500 a month Housing Benefit.

But she was recently pictured partying in Magaluf in Majorca and enjoying a steak dinner at a top restaurant.

‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said.

Her last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000.

Following the popularity of Benefits Street, which followed the lives of families on James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss Kelly has had at least six offers to front programmes, including one for a cookery show in France.

She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and has been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham.

The fortunes of other Benefits stars are not looking as rosy as White Dee's after the show's beloved '50p man' was dropped by a wealthy business partner.

Smoggy earned the admiration of thousands when he was filmed selling essentials door-to-door on James Turner Street for just 50p each - and often giving them away to especially needy people.

Indeed, the convict-turned-entrepreneur gained so much respect that millionaire Charlie Mullins offers to invest in establishing a permanent 50p shop for him.

However, the enterprise - which was going to be turned into a documentary - has fallen through after Smoggy allegedly demanded a £50,000 fee to take part.

Mr Mullins, who founded Pimlico Plumbers and met Smoggy on a Benefits Street-themed TV debate, wrote on his blog that he felt 'completely let down'.

He said Smoggy's agent had demanded the cash before he would appear in front of the cameras. Mr Mullins said Smoggy had 'ruined a great opportunity' and warned him about letting 'vampires' influence his life.
