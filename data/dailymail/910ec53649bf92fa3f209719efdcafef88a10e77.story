Thousands of spectators lined the beach to watch as dogs of all sizes climbed on their boards to ride the waves

First prize for the large dog section went to Hanzo, owned by Eric Felland of Hollywood, California.

Mr Felland said: 'I credit my success to Hanzo's enthusiasm for surfing.

'He loves what he does, and people really see that he really loves to surf, so I think that's the enjoyment people get when they watch him surf.'

Kay DeLoache said she uses a professional coach to train her dog, Jay, to make sure his health is not put at risk.

Some of the dogs that took part in the competition even wore fancy dress costumes

Dogs of all breeds, shapes and sizes took part in the annual surfing competition

She said: 'We do it all very carefully and appropriately for health.'

James Wall, of San Diego, said: 'The key is knowing what your dog likes.

'It's a great bonding experience and if she didn't like it she wouldn't be out here putting up with, she'd run away, she would hide.

'When a dog jumps on the board cause they love being on the board, that's not very cruel.'
