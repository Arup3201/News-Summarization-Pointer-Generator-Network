The BBC launched an investigation after a listener complained that Samantha, the imaginary scorer on long-running Radio 4 comedy show I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue, was being treated as 'a sexual object'.

The programme, which has been on the air for more than 40 years, features comics including Jack Dee and Barry Cryer who regularly refer to the fictional 'lovely Samantha' - who does not actually exist.

After a listener complained about two episodes in July last year which she said included 'highly sexist, offensive and harmful' references to Samantha, The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee looked into the allegations before deciding not to proceed.

I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue  has had a number of regular panellists including host Jack Dee (pictured left)

A recently released BBC Trust report said: 'She considered that Samantha was only referred to as a sexual object and believed the male panellists used 'schoolboy sexist so-called humour', that was 'both puerile and unfunny'.'

The report referred to examples of innuendo included on the show, including a description of the character as 'a lovely lady who's scored on more desks than she can remember'.  

In one episode, listeners were told that Samantha was going to the cinema with two men who were fans of horror films because 'she enjoys nothing better than sitting in the back row and being given the willies for 90 minutes'.

The programme was defended by its producer, who said using innuendo was 'part of the programme's tradition of wordplay and punning' and was appreciated by 'the vast majority of listeners'.

She was also told: 'The 'Samantha' character is a very long running joke in the show which listeners are very familiar with.' 

The listener took her complaint to the BBC Trust and quoted a United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, who in discussing UK society, had referred to a 'boys' club sexist culture' and said that the media was responsible for 'negative and over-sexualised portrayals of women'.  

A letter from a member of the Editorial Complaints Unit to the complainant said: 'You may be reassured to know that your complaint has prompted some lengthy and detailed discussion between senior managers at BBC Radio Comedy and the producers of the show.

'I think it is fair to say that a number of senior figures share, at least in part, your concerns about the manner in which Samantha is portrayed in the programme.

'I have discussed this with the Head of BBC Radio Comedy and she has asked me to tell you that she is currently in talks with the producer of the show about how to update the Samantha character and has said that changes will be made to the way Samantha is presented in the future.' 

The show's producer also told the complainant in a letter that the show would book more female panelists and feature Sven, described as the 'male equivalent of Samantha', more often.

The producer added the show would make it clear that Samantha was a 'willing even enthusiastic participant in the liaisons' and stress that she was often the initiator in these relationships to avoid the suggestion that she was being taken advantage of.'

It would make clear, the letter said, that 'Samantha, like Sven, has a prodigious sexual appetite'.

The BBC Radio 4 programme was defended by its producer who said using innuendo was 'part of the programme's tradition of wordplay and punning' and was appreciated by 'the vast majority of listeners'

The Trust's Editorial Standards Committee said it 'could understand why some listeners believed that this type of humour was outdated', but said 'the majority of listeners were familiar with the content of the show and enjoyed the wordplay associated with the innuendo'. 

However, the Trust also decided the appeal 'did not qualify to proceed for consideration' because it did not have a reasonable prospect of success.

I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue is one of Radio 4's top-performing programmes and according to BBC research, has a higher proportion of female listeners than men.

The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee has five members and sets the editorial and content standards for the BBC, and oversees the editorial complaints process. 

A BBC spokesman said: 'We note and accept the findings of the BBC Trust.' 

'Samantha has to nip off now to meet the Hairy Bikers...They'll light the candle then Samantha will blow them out in the garden.'   

'Samantha has got to go off early to meet an entomologist friend who's been showing her his collection of winged insects. They've already covered his bees and wasps and tonight she's hoping to go through his flies.'

'Samantha has to nip out to the House of Lords with her constituency friend. He's looking for support for his MP who's facing expulsion, and Samantha says it's important to have a good peer if his member's likely to be out.'

'Samantha has to nip off to the National Opera where she's been giving private tuition to the singers. Having seen what she did to the baritone, the director is keen to see what she might to for a tenor.'

'Samantha's just started keeping bees and already has three dozen or so. She says she's got an expert handler coming round to give a demonstration. He'll carefully take out her 38 bees and soon have them flying round his head.'

'Samantha has to go now as she's off to meet her Italian gentleman friend who's taking her out for an ice cream. She says she likes nothing better than to spend the evening licking the nuts off a large Neapolitan.'

'Samantha tells me she has to pop out now as she does a few chores for an elderly gentleman who lives nearby. She shows him how to use the washing machine and then goes out to prune his fruit trees. Later he'll be hanging out his pyjamas as he watches her beaver away up the ladder.'

'After tasting the meat pies, Samantha said she liked Mr Dewhurst's beef in ale, although she preferred his tongue in cider.'
