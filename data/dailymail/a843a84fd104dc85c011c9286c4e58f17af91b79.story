A New Mexico police officer stumbled upon $33,000 in stolen artwork while he was searching an abandoned crystal meth lab. 

The Albuquerque officer found the valuable prints by late American Indian artist Al Momaday last week during a  sweep of a condemned apartment before city officials boarded up the property.

The apartment was deemed uninhabitable following the discovery of the drug lab.

After finding the prints in a portfolio on the floor, the officer put Momaday's name into Google and figured out he was an Oklahoma-born Kiowa painter who died in 1981.

Momaday's paintings depict his Native American heritage and are featured in galleries around the US. 

The officer wrote in his report: 'Knowing this, and knowing all the history about this apartment, I knew (whoever) left this property behind had no lawful reason to be in possession of this (artwork).'

It's possible the artwork was stolen from Momaday’s son, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist N. Scott Momaday

The prints were brought to Albuquerque Museum of Art and History curator Andrew Connors so he could evaluate them, the Albuquerque Journal reported. 

He said: 'Generally we don't get involved in investigations of stolen art, but in this case it's kind of an odd set of prints.

'They may have been stolen out of a warehouse or a back storage building behind a gallery or an artist's estate.

'We have no idea where they could have come from. 

'Wherever it was, they haven't noticed they're gone yet.'

Momaday’s son, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist N. Scott Momaday, indicated it was possible some of his father’s art went missing when he was moving things out of storage to a house in Santa Fe.

In an email to Daily Mail Online, curator Connors confirmed the prints 'probably' belong to the writer. 

He wrote: 'I spoke with his daughter this morning who confirmed that they had probably been taken from their storage unit in Santa Fe.'

The prints are in great shape and they are being kept in the same black case they were found in, KOB 4 reported. 

No arrests have been made and the case remains under investigation. 

Born in Mountain View, Oklahoma, Alfred Momaday was a painter of works depicting his Indian heritage and was also a renowned teacher. His work included alter plaques for churches in Albuquerque.

Momaday, whose Indian name was Haun Toa, meaning War Lance, was the son of Kiowa Indian parents.

In 1933 he married Natachee Scott at Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico, where he initiated a program that brought international reputation to the school.

He was educated at Bacone College, the University of New Mexico, and University of California in Los Angeles. 

From 1942 to 1944, he was in the Ward Department of the US Corps of Engineers.

In 1975 he created a medal for his son, N. Scott Momaday, who was the first American Indian to win a Pulitzer Prize for literature.
