While England have been taking their final game in Brazil seriously enough that they wouldn't allow loyal supporters watch the players train, already-through Costa Rica have been taking a very different approach.

Before the tournament this game was seen as one that England would waltz through to hopefully secure qualification but instead they face the conquerors of Italy and Uruguay's and the Group D leaders.

And even the Costa Ricans seem to be in disbelief - as shown with their mad antics in training that make Roy Hodgson's team look like a joke.

Light-hearted: Ruiz shares a laugh with his team-mates as the Costa Ricans mess around at the Estadio Mineirao

Fulham flop Bryan Ruiz took a turn in goal and was later seen rolling around on the floor laughing as his team-mates messed around.

Former Manchester City striker Paulo Wanchope got in on the act too - the 37-year-old who retired seven years ago was taking part in the session and seemed in a pretty jovial mood with the squad knowing they are already guaranteed a place in the knockout stages.

It is a stark contrast to England where the camp are spreading the message that they are taking their final game seriously - despite Roy Hodgson making changes to his starting XI including bringing in Frank Lampard as captain in place of Steven Gerrard.

Top laugh: Goalkeeper Patrick Bernard celebrates scoring a goal in training - will he be so lucky against England?

Jack Wilshere has spoken of ending the campaign of lows on a high - although it is the least that fans who have spent thousands of pounds following the team in Brazil could expect.

While England have been worried about when Wayne Rooney would score his first World Cup goal, even Costa Rica goalkeeper Patrick Bernard managed to score in training on Monday.

It remains to be seen what sort of side Costa Rica will put out. Coach Jorge Luis Pinto will know that a point will guarantee top spot in the group and a favourable draw but equally he may choose to rest players.

The Costa Rican attitude in training seems to completely contrast with that of the English - and England fans will be wishing that things could have gone differently to leave Wayne Rooney and co in this sort of mood.
