With 17 games gone, Chelsea and Manchester City have broken away from the chasing pack. Sportsmail’s expert columnist assesses both teams’ chances in the title race. 

GOALKEEPER

Chelsea - 9.5, Manchester City - 9

I’m a really big Joe Hart fan, but it has been an inspired decision by Jose Mourinho to bring Thibaut Courtois back from his loan at Atletico Madrid and make him Chelsea’s No 1.

Hart had a tough spell last year, every goalkeeper has to suffer that, and he’s come back stronger, commands the area and has made key saves.

But if Courtois stays at Chelsea he could become the Premier League’s best ever goalkeeper. He is exceptional — if you could choose one goalkeeper in the league to have in your team it would be him.

DEFENCE

Chelsea - 9, Manchester City - 9

When both teams have their back four fit, I can’t separate them.

You can name Chelsea’s four in defence pretty much every week, which has helped Mourinho. Branislav Ivanovic, John Terry, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta are a tight unit, extremely strong, and they have Filipe Luis to bring in at left back if they need a more attacking approach.

Manchester City hardly ever name the same back four, switching Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany, Martin Demichelis, Eliaquim Mangala, Aleksandar Kolarov and Gael Clichy. But they are all top-quality defenders who combine well in a back four.

MIDFIELD

Chelsea - 9.5, Manchester City - 9

Chelsea just edge this after bringing in Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas this year.

If you look at match-winners, both Chelsea and City are full of them. David Silva is a little genius, Samir Nasri is finding form and Yaya Toure can turn defence into attack, run the length of the field and score. Willian, Eden Hazard, Oscar and Fabregas are brilliant technicians.

Frank Lampard has switched sides and will have a vital role for City, but what Chelsea lost in his goals they’ve made up for with Fabregas’s assists; it’s unbelievable he has 12 already.

It is defensive midfield where Chelsea are slightly stronger. Manuel Pellegrini has two similar players in Fernando and Fernandinho who can play that role, but neither are close to Matic, who has been phenomenal.

ATTACK

Chelsea - 9, Manchester City - 9.5

Manchester City are ahead in this department, based purely on Sergio Aguero. Chelsea’s Diego Costa is a brilliant striker and just what Mourinho needed, but Aguero was unstoppable before his injury. They need him fit and firing if they want to win the league.

Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic for City, and Didier Drogba, who is not the player he once was, and Loic Remy at Chelsea are strong alternative options. But it will be a case of who can stay fittest the longest out of Aguero and Costa.

MY TITLE VERDICT...

Chelsea - 37/40, Manchester City - 36.5/40

There is barely anything to pick between the two teams, but what will be a decisive factor is that Chelsea have already got results in difficult away fixtures, whereas City still have many to play. It gives Chelsea that little advantage which could make the difference.

There is no love lost between Mourinho and Pellegrini — these two will never be friends. Pellegrini has no respect for Mourinho and it’s the same the other way.

The league is a two-horse race and right now the Chelsea manager is inching ahead of his rival.
