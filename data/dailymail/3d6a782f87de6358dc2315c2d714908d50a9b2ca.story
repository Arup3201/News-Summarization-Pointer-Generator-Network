It says much about how far Exeter Chiefs have come as a club that Rob Baxter’s men entered this game expecting to beat a team who have won the Premiership three times in the past five years.

In the end, as on so many occasions last season, the Chiefs were a match in every department except the one that matters — the scoreboard — for a visiting side stacked with international talent.

If Sam Hill had not narrowly knocked on Ian Whitten’s inside pass with the line beckoning 16 minutes from time, the result may have been different.

If the Chiefs had opted to kick a penalty at goal with time on the clock, the result may have been different.

If flanker Dave Ewers had not been sin-binned by referee JP Doyle five minutes from time — gifting Leicester another three points — the result might have been different.

But ‘ifs’ don’t deliver Aviva Premiership wins and ultimately, yet again, a young Chiefs side were not quite street smart enough to close out victory against one of the best in the business.

‘We were one moment away from beating a good Leicester side,’ said Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby.

‘If Sam Hill had held on to the ball, we win by a point, we would be sitting here delighted with a performance with a lot of endeavour about it and we’d have scored some good tries.

‘I try not to get too carried away when a game does come down to one or two moments because there’s no value in that. But the lads will know where we lost that game. We lost composure at key times.’

With £10million spent redeveloping Sandy Park by the upwardly mobile Chiefs ahead of next year’s World Cup, there were high hopes around the ground at kick-off. But, just as parts of the stadium remain a work in progress, so do elements of Baxter’s team.

Henry Slade, 21, played out of position at outside centre but proved more than a match for Manu Tuilagi and clearly has a very big future, while inside centre Hill is rough, tough and direct.

There are also high-calibre players to return. England wing Jack Nowell has recovered from knee surgery and will play in an A league game against Harlequins on Monday night, while highly rated hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie is also expected to play again within a month to bolster a creaking Chiefs line-out.

But, at the moment, they do not possess the killer instinct to attack the jugular of the Premiership’s biggest beasts.

Baxter said: ‘You can’t buy experience and we have guys out there who are learning minute by minute. We are going to have to take some pain but we’ll reap the rewards.’

Ewers and Haydn Thomas scored Exeter’s tries, while Gareth Steenson kicked 10 points, but they allowed a 17-10 lead just before half-time to slip as Tigers fly-half Freddie Burns — signed to replace Toby Flood — became an increasingly influential figure in the match.

Burns, impressive in New Zealand for England this summer after a disastrous final season at Gloucester, kicked four out of five kicks at goal and set up Anthony Allen’s first-half try with a neat grubber kick into the in-goal area.

It was, according to his scrum-half partner Ben Youngs, a ‘faultless performance’.

‘Freddie wouldn’t be Freddie without the odd maverick moment,’ said Youngs, who scored Leicester’s second try after 57 minutes.

‘But he knows he needs to be consistent and he has produced two faultless performances in his first two games for the club. He’s got a big match against (England rival) George Ford when we play Bath next week.’

Tigers boss Richard Cockerill opted to keep Tom Croft on the sidelines following the stinger injury he suffered in pre-season, insisting he will be in the match-day 23 to face Bath, and he left Sandy Park satisfied with his side’s second win out of two this season.

‘Sides will get beaten here who will be in and around us at the end of the season,’ Cockerill said.

‘Both sides had guys missing but that was a good win on the road. Freddie is working really hard. Sometimes he will get it right, sometimes he won’t — but I was happy with him today.’
