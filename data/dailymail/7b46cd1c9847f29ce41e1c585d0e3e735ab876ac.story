Northampton substitute Lawson D’Ath did his chances of extending a six-month contract no harm with a double strike on his debut that sealed a 3-2 win at Championship new boys Wolves.

Midfielder D’Ath, 21, who signed on a short-term deal from Reading only last week, put Northampton ahead after 58 minutes and then got the winner with 16 minutes left.

It left Wolves cursing the fact that they had three ‘goals’ with two from Leon Clarke and a strike by Liam McAlinden ruled out for offside.

More agony: Blackpool suffered more heartache as Scott Vernon's goal saw Shrewsbury beat Jose Riga's side

Championship crisis club Blackpool suffered more agony as they crashed out 1-0 to a Shrewsbury side managed by their former midfielder Micky Mellon. Scott Vernon’s 34th-minute goal from close range secured a deserved victory for the League Two team.

Neal Bishop’s header late in the first half was enough to give Scunthorpe their first win over Blackburn, out of the first round for the second successive year. 

Izale McLeod struck the only goal deep into extra-time as League One Crawley dumped out Ipswich, the ninth time in the last 12 years they have been knocked out of the competition by a team from a lower division.

Burton claimed one of the biggest scalps in their history as Dominic Knowles and Stuart Beavon steered the League Two side to a 2-1 victory over Wigan.

MK Dons eased past AFC Wimbledon 3-1 in only the second meeting between the sides since Pete Winkelman relocated the original club a decade ago. Goals from Kyle McFadzean, Daniel Powell and Benik Afobe were enough to see off Neal Ardley’s League Two outfit on a night it was evident this fixture still means an awful lot to both teams.
