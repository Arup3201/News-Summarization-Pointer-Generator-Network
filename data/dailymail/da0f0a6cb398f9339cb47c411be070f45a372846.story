Cancer-stricken Toronto Mayor Rob Ford revealed that he is not 'very good' as he appeared at the ballots on Tuesday to vote for his brother in the city's upcoming mayoral elections.

Ford, who was engulfed in controversy last year after he was caught on video smoking a crack pipe, is just coming off his second round of chemotherapy treatment for a rare form of cancer.

The mayor, whose blond hair has been thinned by the treatment, had intended to run for re-election on October 27 but after his cancer diagnosis, he pulled out of the race and his brother Doug, a city councilor, took over his place.

At the ballots on Tuesday, he said he was feeling tired but wanted to support his brother. 

Supportive: Mayor Rob Ford, who has just finished his second round of chemo for a rare and aggressive cancer, casts his ballot for his brother during advance voting for the Toronto Municipal Elections on Tuesday

Battle: Ford, 45, told reporters that he is tired and not feeling very good following his second chemo treatment

Struggle: Ford, who was diagnosed with cancer after returning to work following a stint in rehab for alcohol and drug addiction this summer, has been given just a 50 per cent chance of survival 

Despite dropping his mayoral bid, Rob Ford is still running for his old council seat.

He returns to hospital for another round of chemotherapy on October 29. 

CBC reported that Ford began chemo treatments in September shortly after doctors found signs of malignant liposarcoma in his abdomen.

Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue cancer that begins in fat cells, or fatty tissue, and occurs most often in older adults. 

Disappointed: Ford had refused to step down after his drug scandal but his diagnosis has now forced him to 

Troubled: The mayor, pictured waiting for an elevator after casting his vote on Tuesday, had to pull out of the mayoral elections following the diagnosis and his brother is running for office instead

The cancer is extremely rare, affecting only about 2.5 people for every million, and doctors say the survival rate is a coin toss. Ford has been given just a 50 per cent chance of survival.

His doctors are now trying to shrink the five-inch tumor with chemotherapy and then reassess. The cancer has not spread to his organs, they said. 

'The kids, it's ripping my heart out,' said Ford earlier this month about his two children, who are seven and nine, adding that they know exactly what's happening with their father's diagnosis.

'Some nights I just cry myself to sleep, but what can you do, there's only that many tears that can be shed.'

But he added that he 'sees the glass as half full' and that he is taking it 'day to day'.

Ford, 45, has been engulfed in controversy since the Toronto Star and the U.S. website Gawker last year reported the existence of a video apparently showing the mayor inhaling from a crack pipe.

Together: Doug, pictured left with the mayor after he returned to work following rehab in July, has an uphill battle to take the mayorship as his campaigning started late. Rob Ford has spoken out in support of him

After months of denials, he finally admitted to using crack but adamantly refused to resign, even after Toronto's City Council stripped him of most of his powers.

A stream of revelations of erratic behavior, public drunkenness - and a report of another crack video - finally prompted him to enter rehab earlier this year. 

Ford took a two-month break from officein the summer to undergo treatment for substance abuse at a rehabilitation center and returned to work in July.

He was hospitalized in September after suffering from abdominal pain for three months.
