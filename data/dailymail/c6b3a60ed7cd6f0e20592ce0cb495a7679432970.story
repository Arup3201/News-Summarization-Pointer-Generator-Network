A band of parents have formed a vigilante group to snare suspected paedophiles.

Their tactics have led to six arrests – but police forces have reacted with anger, warning that they could be compromising existing investigations.

The parents have set up dozens of profiles on dating and social networking websites, pretending to be girls aged 12 to 15.

Using these, the group, who call themselves Letzgo Hunting, exchange 
messages with suspected paedophiles, sometimes for weeks, before luring 
them into meetings in parks or other public areas.

The parents, some of whom are trained in the martial arts of jujitsu and
 karate, film the resulting confrontations, in which they demand an 
explanation from the men and warn them to expect to be arrested.

They then upload the footage on to their website and Facebook page. 
Their most recent video, created on Sunday, shows a suspect flee as a 
vigilante gives chase in a park on the outskirts of Leicester.

The clip was viewed 4,000 times within two hours yesterday. The group’s 
Twitter account was also inundated with messages of support from members
 of the public as word of their activities spread.

The group – three men and a woman assisted by 13 ‘helpers’ – admit to 
being vigilantes but say they are not a lynch mob and never threaten 
violence.

But Leicestershire Police warned that such ‘naming and shaming’ tactics 
threatened ‘chances of success in court’, potentially blocking justice.

Child welfare charity the NSPCC also urged the group to step back and 
said tracking down paedophiles must be done ‘by proper authorities’.

And Warwickshire Police and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection
 Centre added to warnings that vigilantes could harm investigations.

Letzgo Hunting’s leader, who calls himself Scumm Buster, told the Daily 
Mail he works in the security industry, but declined to reveal the 
backgrounds of the others. He said the group had 84 online profiles, 
using images of young-looking adult female friends with their consent. 
Sometimes these were airbrushed to remove signs of ageing such as 
wrinkles and ‘make the girls look obviously young’.

He added: ‘Usually the men meet us under their real names but we will 
also try to find out what car they will be arriving in, so we can make a
 note of the registration plate to pass on to the police.’

He said the explicit nature of some of the men’s online messages was 
‘shocking’, but explained it was crucial to actually meet each suspect 
because that is what proves their ‘intent’ to break the law under the 
Sexual Offences Act 2003 by inciting a child to participate in a sexual 
act.

The men are asked to bring condoms and alcohol to the meetings and 
sometimes the female member of the vigilante group is used as ‘bait’ to 
ensure the men step out of their cars.

So far, they have carried out nine ‘stings’, resulting in seven 
confrontations. The other two men drove away after becoming suspicious.

As a result, Leicestershire Police have arrested three men. One further 
arrest has been made by West Midlands Police, one by Warwickshire Police
 and another yesterday by Nottinghamshire Police.

Scumm Buster said the group, aged 20 to 50 and from the Hinckley area of
 Leicestershire, are ‘close friends’ and openly film their suspects.

The footage is immediately passed to the police and is removed from the 
group’s website when an arrest is made. They are currently monitoring up
 to 50 men online, he added.
