One bride thinks her wedding video is literally the 'worst thing in the world' and she's suing her videographer for around $50,000 in damages for making her wedding seem like 'an episode of Seinfeld.'

26-year-old Monica Nikchemny married Felix Komrash, 33, in September 2012.

The Mail Online spoke with Monica and her lawyer Mikhail Usher who said the couple received a satisfactory wedding trailer a month after the wedding but one year later they were horrified with the actual video. 

When the family received the wedding video, Monica was brought to tears and 'almost had a nervous breakdown.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Monica and her father are suing the wedding video company Visualaz who Monica claims ruined her special day by adding in mismatched sound effects and fake applause.

'When I watched my wedding video it really sounded like I was watching an episode of 'Seinfeld,' she said. 'It really was ridiculous.'

Now Monica is taking the Brooklyn based company Visualaz to court, reports mamamia.com.

Visualaz is run by Igor Boshoer and his wife Valerie. Igor boasts Hollywood credits for visual effects for films such as 'The Wolf of Wall Street.'

Monica told the Mail Online that Visualaz claims to be a Hollywood production company and that they kept putting off her video because they had 'too much other Hollywood work' to do.

She explained that they are a new company for whom wedding videos are a 'side job' but she was willing to give them a chance after seeing other wedding trailers they'd completed.

Monica said she never saw a full video of theirs before her wedding otherwise she may not have chosen them.

She says her own wedding trailer makes her wedding video appear to be fun and romantic but she says in reality the trailer is a misrepresentation of what her video really is like.

Monica told the Mail Online that the trouble with the company Visualaz started before they even received the video.

The New York Daily News reports that when the couple asked for a short 'love story clip' to be played during the ceremony, the filmmakers suggested that Komrash should be dressed as a transvestite in a dress who falls in love with his future wife, says court papers filed Wednesday in the Brooklyn Supreme Court.

Monica told the Mail Online that her husband expressed wishes for the 'love story clip' to be a scene from his favorite movie but that Visualaz rejected his ideas.

Nikchemny said that the transvestite suggestion from Visualaz was 'very inappropriate and disrespectful' and a 'complete joke.'

Nikhemny also claims that the video company only showed up with a small piece of the equipment they promised in their $13,000 contract.

When the bride did receive the video after 'months of postponement' she said it lacked a 'beginning middle and an end.' 

'They acted in such a way that was so extreme and outrageous,' said the family's lawyer, Mikhail Usher.

'We're asking for damages above and beyond the contract.'

Usher told the Mail Online that they are asking for the $13,000 cost of the wedding video plus punitive damages for 'mistreatment' and for causing emotional distress.

'A lot of publications keep changing the amounts we are suing the company for,' said Monica's lawyer.

'We are asking for around $50,000,' he said.

Nikchemny owns a third generation bridal store in Sheepshead Bay called 'Monica's Bridal' and says it was important to her that her wedding was perfect and top-notch.

Nikchemny got the video when she was pregnant an says that the stress caused by the video led to 'medical complications.'

Doctors checked the bride's blood sugar the same week she received the video and it was dangerously high due to her stress levels 'caused by the video.'

'How can I show my son this video?' she asked.

'These memories, I'll never be able to get back again.'

Monica claims if she wanted the raw footage she'd have to sign over the rights to her own wedding video. She said the raw video was also 
missing important parts of her ceremony such as the cocktail hour, 
dessert table, and the signing of the Jewish wedding agreement.

'My wedding video was basically just people dancing,' said Monica. They left out key moments, she said, like the cigar bar and other parts of the ceremony.

The company was surprised to hear that the couple didn't like their video.

Visualaz got a positive response from fans on facebook who applauded the 14 minute trailer. Monica warns people not to be 'fooled' by the same trailer that she received one month after her wedding.

The Mail Online tried contacting Visualaz but no one was available for comment.
