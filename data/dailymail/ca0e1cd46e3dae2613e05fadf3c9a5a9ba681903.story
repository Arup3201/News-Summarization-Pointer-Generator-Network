Authorities believe 28-year-old Terry Killings Jr of Wildwood lost control of his ATV while he was racing last night and swerved and struck several spectators, including toddler Jakhyrian Graham.

Jakhyrian died after being transported to UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville.

A man who was watching the race with Jakhyrian, 56-year-old Johnny Williams of Ocala, was also hit. 

After running into the spectators, Killings 'was ejected' from his vehicle, News 13 Orlando reported.

Killings and Williams were transported to Ocala Regional Medical Center with serious injuries.

The crash happened around 6.42pm at the intersection of County Road 235 and Northeast 6th Boulevard in Wildwood.

Other spectators were also hospitalized.  

The second ATV involved in the race, which is believed to be purple in color, has not been recovered, 

Similar unsanctioned ATV races have taken place in rural Sumter County over the last several weeks, according to Sgt. Steve Gaskins.
