Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois is not worried about fatigue over the Christmas period and has challenged his team-mates to maintain their form over the Christmas period. 

The Blues have seven Premier League games - starting against Tottenham on Tuesday - in the next month and Courtois knows this could be a defining period in the title race. 

For the 22-year-old, the period will be extra challenging as during his three seasons in Spain he became accustomed to a winter break.

'I like to play games but it’s a little bit weird for me to play over Christmas,' Courtois told Chelsea's club website. 

'In Spain we normally played until December 22 and then had seven days free, so it’s not a big difference, it’s not a problem.

'It’s an important week with two difficult games. First [there is] a derby against Tottenham in front of our own fans and then we go away to Newcastle, which will be tough.

'It’s an important month and we will try to win as many games as we can.'

Chelsea are currently unbeaten in 20 games in all competitons since the start of the season.
