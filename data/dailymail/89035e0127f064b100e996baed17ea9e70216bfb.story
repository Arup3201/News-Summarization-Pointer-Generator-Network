Maria Shriver cheated on  Arnold Schwarzenegger with his own campaign strategist - flaunting the relationship in front of staffers five years before her husband's affair with the family maid was exposed, a shocking new report claims.

Shriver debuted boyfriend Matthew Dowd last month at her cousin Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s wedding - introducing him to the family at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. According to initial reports, the two have been seeing each other for less than a year. 

However, the New York Post now claims that Shriver and Dowd started their relationship in 2006 when Dowd was a chief strategist for Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial reelection campaign. Schwarzenegger found out, but she continued the relationship anyway, according to the newspaper.

Shriver and Schwarzenegger split up in 2011 after it was revealed he had an affair with the family's housekeeper 'Patty' Baena that dated back to 1992 and that they had a teenage son together. 

The New York Post claims that Maria Shriver had an affair with Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign strategist Matthew Dowd - beginning in 2006. The couple are seen here at Schwarzenegger's swear-in in 2007

The divorce hasn't been finalized, but the pair have been living apart since Schwarzenegger went public with his love child. 

Dowd, now a political analyst for ABC News, denied having an affair with Shriver in 2006 - and told the Post that they were just 'good friends' at that time.

Neither Dowd nor representatives for Shriver or Schwarzenegger responded to requests for comment from MailOnline. 

Former Schwarzenegger's campaign staffers are now coming forward to expose Shriver's dalliances with Dowd, according to the Post. 

'There was a lot of flirtation. They frequently spent time alone, and Arnold was rarely, if ever, around when they were together,' one staffer told the newspaper.

'She had a unique banter with him and lit up when he was around. He was comfortable poking fun at her, and she would slap him teasingly.'

The pair often spent time alone together after meetings and took long walks, according to the Post. 

When Schwarzenegger found out about the relationship, he removed Dowd from his inner-circle. The governor and Shriver fought about it constantly on the campaign trail, the newspaper reports. 

After Schwarzenegger won a second term as California governor, he and Shriver remained together in public - but she continued to see Dowd on the side, the Post claims. 

A source told the Post that in 2007, she went to see Dowd at the Four Season in New York and that the pair were seen out together in Santa Monica, California. 

When Schwarzenegger's marriage to Shriver ended, he forbade any of his friends and staffers from publicly talking about Shriver's relationship with Dowd, according to the Post. 

Dowd made his reputation as one of the mastermind's behind George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns and was part of the president's inner circle until he began speaking out against him in 2006.

Shriver and Dowd were first spotted in public together last October. Both come from large Irish Catholic families - and both have a history of heartbreak

He's the third of 11 children from a strict Irish Catholic family. He was an altar boy and keeps at least 100 crosses in his rural Texas home. He's been married and divorced twice; his second marriage fell apart after one of his twin infant daughters died in the hospital, according to a 2007 profile piece in the Los Angeles Times.  

He also worked for Shriver's husband - taking a job on Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial reelection campaign.    

Shriver, 58, has been dating Dowd, 52, since last fall, according to the Washington Post - although Kennedy's wedding to Cheryl Hines appears to be their first public event together.

They both currently work in broadcasting. Dowd is an ABC political analyst and fixture on the Sunday talk shows. Shriver is a special 

Shriver - the niece of Robert F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy - was married to Schwarzenegger for 25 years until it was revealed that he had an affair with his maid and had fathered a child with her. She and Schwarzenegger have four children together. 

Dowd grew up in Detroit, Michigan, the son of an auto executive father and a school teacher mother. Dowd told the Times his family would have been upper-middle class - if his strict Irish Catholic parents hadn't had 11 children. 

He was an altar boy and even considered the priesthood - though, he told the Times, he liked girls too much. He has two grown sons with his first wife and a 12-year-old daughter Josephine with his second wife.

That marriage ended after his wife gave birth to twin girls in 2002. Josephine survived. Her sister died after two months in the hospital.

After he publicly criticized the Bush administration over its handling of gay marriage and the Iraq War, he left politics and moved to a ranch in rural Wimberly, Texas, an hour outside of Austin.

A Times reporter described his house as having more than 100 crosses. Above his fireplace, he has the Prayer of St. Francis: 'Lord, make me an instrument of your peace, where this hatred, let me sow love.'
