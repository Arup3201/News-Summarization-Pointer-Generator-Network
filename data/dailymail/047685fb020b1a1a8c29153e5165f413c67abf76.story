'Sirloin' and 'tofu' have become code words for 'Republican' and 'Democrat' in Colorado, and a former right-wing state legislator assigned liberals the role of pressed bean curd during a conservative convention in Denver.

John Andrews, president of the Colorado state Senate until 2005 and now Director of the Centennial Institute – an affiliate of Colorado Christian College – told a crowd estimated at 3,000 that speakers at the three-day session would not be permitted to talk about candidates, parties or elections.

'Republican' and 'Democrat' were four-letter words at the Western Conservative Summit, he said. Instead, attendees should talk about meat and fake meat.

John Andrews, a senior official at Colorado Christian College and the director of its affiliated Centennial Institute, told thousands that no one at the Western Conservative Conference could talk about elections, candidates or political parties

For three days in Denver – and maybe longer – grilled steak and sliced bean curd have replaced elephants and donkeys as the preferred political mascots

'I need to let you in on a secret,' Andrew said after speeches by gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez and Rep. Cory Gardner, who is running neck-and-neck with Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in his upset bid.

'You have probably noticed that as we brought out Bob Beauprez and Cory Gardner, that something was missing,' he said. 'Something was not said about them or by them about how they're spending 2014.'

'I can give you the reason why in two words: Lois Lerner.'

Lerner is the former IRS official at the center of an alleged plot to target conservative nonprofits for their beliefs by subjecting them to intrusive scrutiny and years-long delays when they applied for tax-exempt status.

Her office, the Exempt Organizations Division, began a push in 2010 to evaluate applications with an eye toward the possibility of partisan political activity that might disqualify groups from that special status under section 501(c) of the tax code.

'Yes, Colorado Christian University enjoys a 501(c)(3) tax status,' Anderson explained, 'and we've been advised that the summit needs to stick to issues and ideas, and principles and policies. And that at this summit, because we don't have all the candidates represented, we can't talk about anybody being a candidate.'

'So we can't talk about candidates,' he said to a mini-chorus of gasps. 'We can't talk about races. We can't talk about parties, or Republicans and Democrats.'

Enter the attorneys.

'I had the code researched by the best tax lawyer in the country,' said Anderson.

'I said, "Are we allowed to talk about sirloin and tofu?" He said, "Yes you are".'

Sirloin power: The Western Conservative Summit had the top trending hashtag among tweets in Denver on Friday, and the eight-most-tweeted in the United States

'So let's just make this agreement ... If you form a mental association between "Republican" and "sirloin," and between "Democrat" and "tofu," and I was to say to you that every time I whiff Bob Beauprez or Cory Gardner it makes me wanna eat more sirloin and less tofu, you would know what I was talking about, right?'

Anderson then introduced Jill Repella, a county commissioner running for the job of lieutenant governor.

Repella, he said, was the evening's 'third helping of sirloin.'

In a state known for cattlemen, the program's Friday night headliners included other cuts of meat, and no tofu.

Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and crowd favorite Dr. Ben Carson – who has attracted a multimillion-dollar 'draft' committee urging him to run for president – were on the butcher's cart.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin will speak Saturday
