Former figure skater Johnny Weir has announced that he and his husband Victor Voronov have broken up after two years of marriage.

The Olympics commentator, 29, revealed the split on Twitter on Wednesday, writing: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.'

The couple, who were married two years ago, parted ways after Weir's packed schedule meant he was too busy to spend time or take a vacation with his attorney husband, TMZ Sports reported.

Violence at home: The couple appeared together earlier this month to get a domestic dispute case dismissed. Voronov accused Weir of biting him about a month before the Olympics

Voronov had supported his husband's 
career, according to the site, but they had only seen each other two or 
three times in the past month and their plans for a holiday were repeatedly stalled.

Their relationship also ran into trouble recently when Voronov accused Weir of biting him in a police report.

But
 the couple put on a united front when they convinced a New Jersey judge
 to throw out the domestic dispute case earlier this month.

The former figure skater, whose commentary during Sochi established him as one of its biggest stars, appeared to still be with Voronov when they attended Lyndhurst Municipal Court on March 4 to get the case dismissed.

Voronov, a lawyer, filed a police report about a month before the Olympics claiming the former ice skating champion had bit him, a source told RadarOnline.

The pair put
 on a united front, with Voronov placing his hand on his husband's knee 
and whispering into his ear, the website reported.

Weir, dressed in an unusually somber black outfit, caught the attention of the judge, who commented 'Nice hairdo!' as he approached the bench.

The couple asked the Lyndhurst Municipal Court judge to dismiss the case, and it was granted.

Leaving the court, Weir told Radar: 'It is a private matter I do not wish to discuss.'

Police and court officials declined to reveal further details because it is a domestic dispute case.

Weir officially came out as
 gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay 
suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality.

On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov, a Georgetown Law graduate.

Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told 
IceNetwork that Voronov, who comes from a Russian family but grew up in 
Atlanta, was 'kind of everything that I've ever looked for and aspired 
to be in a relationship with'.

He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind.

'He's
 wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my 
razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually 
do.'

But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery.

'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said.

'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'
