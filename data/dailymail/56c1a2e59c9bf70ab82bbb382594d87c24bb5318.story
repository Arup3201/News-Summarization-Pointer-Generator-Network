After eating fruit from the forbidden tree, they were banished from 'paradise' to live in the wilderness.

Now, drivers in Cambridge appear to have been handed a similar fate to biblical couple, Adam and Eve.

A religiously symbolic road sign was erected in the city, reading: 'Paradise Street Closed - For Adam & Eve Street Follow Diversion'.

Symbolic: This road sign has clear symbolic links to biblical couple Adam and Eve's expulsion from 'paradise'

It left hundreds of motorists puzzled - with many, at first, believing it to be an April Fools' joke.

However, the sign off East Road was later revealed to be warning drivers of a genuine temporary road closure.

A photo of the notice was posted on Facebook with the message: 'It was April Fools' Day but I think this is genuine highways signage ... clever religious connotations though all the same.'

Indeed, the sign has clear symbolic links to Adam and Eve's expulsion from the 'paradise' of the Garden of Eden, as described in the Book of Genesis.

In the story, the couple are banished into the wilderness after Eve is tricked by a serpent into eating fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge.

Paradise Street and Adam & Eve Street, in Cambridge, were given their biblical names because they were built over the Garden of Eden allotments.

The area now houses the Grafton Centre, near the city's former red light district.
