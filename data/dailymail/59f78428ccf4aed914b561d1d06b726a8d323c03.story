Taxpayer-owned shares in Lloyds Banking Group are close to being sold off by the Government, but at a far lower level than first thought, it emerged today.

George Osborne is understood to have told the bank's board that when the price hits 61p, 7p more than its current level when the FTSE opened today, they will be cashed in.

But it had been understood that the Treasury would not sell until they hit around 74p - the average price they paid five years ago.

Lloyds is 39 per cent publicly-owned by after the Government was forced to step in to bail-out the bank with £5bn at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.

Sell off: After bailing out the bank in 2008 the Government is prparing to shed its 39 per cent stake in Lloyds Banking Group - which announced another huge loss today

It came as the bank announced losses of  £570million last year, down from £3.5billion in 2011.

But despite this hit, boss Antonio Horta-Osorio has been awarded a £1.5 million shares bonus while staff will share a £365 million total pot.

This is despite further losses in the wake of mammoth provisions for mis-selling claims.

The taxpayer-backed bank remained in the red in 2012 after setting aside £3.6billion for compensation relating to the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal and £400 million for the mis-selling of interest rate swaps to small businesses.

Lloyds said Mr Horta-Osorio's bonus has been deferred for five years and will only be paid out if shares reach and remain at 73.6p for a sustained period, or if the Government is able to sell at least a third of its stake at a profit.

Staff will share out a £365 million bonus pool, down 3 per cent on 2011, giving each employee around £3,900 on average. Cash bonuses have been capped at £2,000.

Mr Horta-Osorio insisted the group’s sale of more than 600 branches to the Co-operative Bank remained on track in spite of reports earlier this week that the Co-op is battling to plug a potential £1 billion capital hole discovered by the Financial Services Authority.

He said the Co-op remained “absolutely committed to this deal” and confirmed Lloyds will be separating the branches under the TSB brand on the high street by August in preparation to be offloaded.

Lloyds said losses narrowed significantly from £3.5 billion a year earlier thanks to improvements in its core business.

But much of this was down to cost-cutting, as income fell 13 per cent amid historic low interest rates.

Lloyds said it was very close to its original target to bring costs down to around £10 billion and was now hoping to cut costs even further, to £9.8 billion, in 2013.

The group added that it boosted lending to small business by 4 per cent on a net basis and helped 55,000 customers buy their first home.
