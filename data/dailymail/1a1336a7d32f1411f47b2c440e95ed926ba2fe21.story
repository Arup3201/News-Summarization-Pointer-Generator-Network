Seventeen past and present Cronulla rugby league players have reportedly been issued with show-cause notices after meeting with the NRL and anti-doping authority.

The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night, according to News Corp Australia.

The notices, which follow ASADA's anti-doping investigation into the Cronulla Sharks' 2011 supplements program, were distributed to the lawyers of players on Wednesday and signals the authority's intent to charge players.

Cronulla Sharks player Anthony Tupou refused to comment as he left his lawyer in Sydney. He was one of the 17 past and present players to be given doping notices over the club's 2011 supplements program

It's believed they varied in severity, with potential bans ranging between six months and two years.

Players have been given 10 days to respond and may choose to challenge the show-cause notices in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court.

The Sharks skipper, Paul Gallen, was one of 17 past and present players involved in the club's 2011 supplements program to be reportedly offered suspensions of six months or less, instead of the usual two years for an anti-doping offence.

Among some of the other players are Kade Snowden, Luke Douglas, Matthew Wright, Jayson Bukuya, Anthony Tupou, Albert Kelly, Jeremy Smith, Wade Graham and Nathan Gardner.

Sharks captain Paul Gallen is one of the majority of past and present Cronulla NRL players implicated in the ASADA scandal who have elected to accept the deal that will see them miss just three matches

The notices handed out to players, including Wade Graham (pictured), will only see players miss this season's last three games and a few weeks of next year's training before the 2015 season begins

Earlier on Wednesday Gallen said if he or any other Cronulla player accept reduced bans offered by ASADA, they'll automatically be labelled drug cheats.

'There is two ways to look at it,' Gallen Sky Sports Radio's Big Sports Breakfast.

'Obviously there's a lot of rumours going around the past couple of days - the boys have spoken about it.

'Our mind and our mood changes every 10 minutes. At one stage we're (thinking) "thank God, this is going to be over hopefully, whatever happens is going to happen and we can just get on with life".

'Because closure on this thing would just be unbelievable (after) what we've gone through the past two seasons.

'But then you say "let's stuff this, we've done nothing wrong". It's a real hard situation to be in.'

Gallen was unsure if the players would be offered deals and whether it could be in anyway related to ASADA's progress in its investigation of AFL club Essendon which has been hit by court action.

'I've asked (my lawyer) about that and we're not 100 percent sure, because (my lawyer) believes that they're probably going to try and back us into a corner where we have to make a decision, basically ASAP before the Essendon thing is over,' he said.

The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority boss Ben McDevitt agreed to 17 doping notices on Tuesday night and lawyers for players like Anthony Tupou were issued the notices on Wednesday

'But as I said we don't know that for sure yet.

'It's what you see in a movie. But it's actually happening and we're right in the middle of it. It's pretty tough to take.'

Gallen was adamant he hadn't taken any banned substance.

'I'm 100 per cent positive I've never taken anything that's been on any banned list,' he said.

It was pointed out to Gallen that, if he accepted a six-month ban, he would miss only one month of next NRL season, but he would also miss out on representing Australia in the Four Nations series later this year and potential lucrative off-season boxing bouts he hoped to have.

Among some of the other players offered suspensions are Kade Snowden, Luke Douglas (pictured), Matthew Wright, Jayson Bukuya, Anthony Tupou, Albert Kelly, Jeremy Smith, Wade Graham and Nathan Gardner

'That's huge - you can't get those games for Australia back,' he said.

'But it's your reputation; it's what I've built over the last 15-plus years in training fulltime and getting to where I've got to in the game.

'It's tarnished now already, but no matter what, if we do this we're going to be labelled a drug cheat.'
