Alexander Cameron's attempt to halt a fraud trial by saying legal aid cuts meant the defendants wouldn't get a fair trial has failed

A judge's decision to throw out a multimillion-pound fraud trial after defendants said they couldn't afford adequate representation has been overturned by the Court of Appeal.

The Prime Minister's barrister brother, Alexander Cameron QC, had successfully argued that the £5million scam case should be thrown out because of legal aid reforms introduced by his sibling's government.

He said that controversial Ministry of Justice (MoJ) reforms meant the five defendants could not find barristers of 'sufficient competence', and the case was halted at the beginning of this month.

But today three judges quashed the ruling, insisting that the trial go ahead.

Their decision came after City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) urged Lord Justice Leveson, Lord Justice Davis, and Lord Justice Treacy to overturn the decision taken by Judge Anthony Leonard at London's Southwark Crown Court on 1 May.

The trial, which involves the alleged mis-selling of land to members of the public, is a so-called Very High Cost Case (VHCC).  The government has cut fees for such long and complex cases by 30 per cent for barristers and solicitors.

Judge Leonard had said that adjourning the case til next year, as requested by the prosecution, would clog up the courts and would not help the defendants find lawyers to represent them.  As a result, he ruled, they would not be guaranteed a fair trial, and so he ordered that the case be 'stayed'.

However the FCA appealed his decision, arguing that the judge 'erred in principle' and 'came to an unreasonable decision'.

Today, Sir Brian said he and his fellow judges agreed, saying: 'This ruling does involve errors of law or principle and, in any event, was not reasonable'.

If the appeal had failed, the defendants - Scott Crawley, Dale Walker, Daniel Forsyth, Aaron Petrou and Brendan Daley, who are charged with conspiracy to defraud - would have been acquitted.

Sir Brian said: 'During the course of the hearing, we 
made it clear that the dispute between the Bar and the Lord Chancellor 
about the appropriate level of remuneration for VHCCs was not one in 
which we could, or should, become involved.

The trial, involving an alleged £5million property scam, will now go ahead at London's Southwark Crown Court

Sir Brian Leveson said the original judge's decision to halt the multi-million pound trial was erroneous

'It involves a commercial negotiation in which, short of legal challenge, the judiciary can play no part.'

After the ruling, the FCA said it 'welcomed' the Court of Appeal's decision.

Alex
 Cameron QC, who is representing seven defendants free of charge, argued
 that his legally aided clients could not find barristers 'of sufficient
 competence'.

The case involves Scott Crawley,
 35, who is said to have masterminded a £5million scam between 2008 and 2011
 through the firms Plott UK, European Property Investments (EPI) and 
Stirling Alexander.

He is accused alongside Daniel 
Forsyth, 30, Ross Peters, 27, Aaron Petrou, 46, Ricky Mitchie, 24, Adam 
Hawkins, 28, and Brendan Daley, 38, of conspiracy to defraud.

The
 eighth defendant, solicitor Dale Walker, 53, is facing fraud charges 
and an allegation of money laundering in relation to the case.

The
 charges arose out of Operation Cotton, a Financial Conduct Authority 
investigation into the activities of the land banking firms.

Legal aid costs about £2billion a year, half of which goes on criminal defence with the other half going to civil cases including mental health, asylum and family law.

Last year, the government cut fees for legal aid in Very High Costs Cases (VHCCs) by 30 per cent, and fees for other Crown Court work by up to 18 per cent.

This sparked a series of protests from the legal profession, with opponents arguing that complex cases need experienced lawyers (with fees to match) and saying the cuts will affect defendants' right to a fair trial.

However, recent figures released under the Freedom of Information act showed that 20 of the highest-paid legal aid barristers in England and Wales shared nearly £8.5m for defending alleged criminals unable to fund their own defences.

The Ministry of Justice has defended its decision to cut costs, saying: 'We have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world.

'We have reduced the cost of a small number of the longest running criminal cases by 30 per cent - just one of these cases recently cost more than £8 million in legal aid.

'We want to ensure the limited money we have for legal aid is concentrated on those cases and people who need it most.'
