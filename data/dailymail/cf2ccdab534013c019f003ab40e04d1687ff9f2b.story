An earthquake has struck the Rutland area of the East Midlands again, just 24 hours after a similar tremor shook houses in the area for ten seconds.

Initial data released by the British Geological Survey (BGS) said the latest 3.5-magnitude quake, the biggest in the region since October 2001, struck the Oakham area at around 7:50 am today.

Yesterday’s 3.2-magnitude quake occurred at 7:07am and reportedly shook houses.

Today's earthquake struck at 7:50am, just 24 hours after the previous one hit at 7:07am on 17 April, causing some alarm for members of the public

The UK is not itself generally associated with earthquakes. However, according to the BGS, 20 to 30 tremors are felt every year, while a few smaller ones are tracked by sensitive instruments.

While most are small and cause no damage, there is the potential for larger ones in future.

The UK does not lie on a major fault line, but it’s thought that smaller unseen fault lines, known as blind fault lines, are deeper underground.

Nearby tectonic boundaries such as that between Eurasia and Africa can induce tremors in smaller fault lines like the ones in the UK.

‘If you look at your hand, imagine the main lines as a major tectonic boundary,’ Glenn Ford, a seismologist at the BGS, explains to MailOnline.

‘Between these are little lines, and if you gently squeeze your hand you see that even these smaller lines move back and forwards.’

While today’s earthquake was large for the UK, tremors are a common and largely unnoticed occurrence across the rest of the world.

It is estimated that 17,000 to 20,000 earthquakes of this size occur every year in the world.

However, seismologists think that a larger one could strike the mainland UK one day and cause significant damage.

‘This particular one was 3.5 which in UK terms is quite significant,’ says Ford.

‘We maybe get one or two a year of that size.

‘We had a 4.1 in the Bristol Channel back on the 20th of February. They’re not like buses - they come when they want, but statistically we don’t get many of this size.’

It's thought that millions of years ago the UK could have been situated over a major fault line such as the San Andreas Fault, pictured at Carrizo Plain National Monument in California, USA

For residents of Rutland, the tremors proved to be cause for some alarm.

Within half an hour of the first quake striking, the BGS had received around 140 calls from people who had felt the tremors.

According
 to the BGS, an earthquake has to reach a magnitude of 4.5 before it can
 be expected to do any damage. Emergency services have not reported any 
casualties or damage to property.

Among 
those who felt yesterday's tremor was former English rugby union player Austin 
Healey.

He tweeted: 'We've just had an earthquake in Oakham. The house 
was shaking for about 10 secs.'

Louise Warren, 40, was getting four year-old son Adam ready for school when it struck.

Ms Warrwen,
 of Stamford, Lincolnshire, said: 'The shaking sound started quite 
suddenly and my electric toothbrush fell from the shelf into my sink.

'It felt like a lorry going past my house but about ten times louder. There was a second shake soon after the first one stopped.

'I wasn't too scared because I remember when we had a tremor here about eight years ago.

'My
 son was a bit frightened because he'd never felt anything like it 
before. But he's a boy, so he did think it was pretty cool.'

A British Geological Survey chart shows the tremors from the first earthquake that hit Rutland shortly after 7am yesterday before the second earthquake, a magnitude 3.5, struck today

The spike in the seismology readings can clearly be seen when the first earthquake hit yesterday

The reason for two earthquakes occurring so close to each other might be the result of stresses building up in the faults.

Magnitude 1 and 2 – Not felt by people, detected by instruments.

Magnitude 3 – Silght tremor felt by people indoors, likened to a passing lorry.

Magnitude 4 – Can crack walls, disturb trees.

Magnitude 5 – Moves furniture, damages poorly built buildings.

Magnitude 6 – Moderate to major damage, chimneys and walls collapse.

Magnitude 7 – Major damage to all buildings, ground cracks, landslides can occur.

Magnitude 8 – Total destruction, waves can be seen travelling through the ground.

‘In other parts of the world they wouldn’t be talking about this,' says Ford.

‘The tremor is very, very small compared to the quakes we see in areas of high seismic activity such as Greece.

‘For us 90 per cent of earthquakes are unnoticed, but when [the bigger ones] do happen we get alarmed.

‘The public is not calibrated to them, maybe because people think they don’t actually happen.’

Ford says this one was probably more noticeable as well because many people are off work for the Easter holiday.

‘This one happened at a good time today for people to feel it.

‘They are lying down in an ideal position to feel earthquakes, very small tremors that people would never expect to feel.

‘If you look at what people describe it’s like a large lorry going past.

‘An earthquake of this size can go 
unnoticed up in the highlands, or if it happens at a time of day where 
people are busy or in road traffic.

‘Many people today also realise another happened yesterday, so they are more aware.

‘People
 are looking out for them now, and in shops and supermarkets they’ll be 
saying “oh, did you feel the earthquake?” to each other.'

Sensitive equipment is able to measure tiny tremors unnoticed by the public in the UK

Scientists from Columbia University claim fracking could cause powerful earthquakes capable of destroying buildings as the process of extracting gas weakens fault lines deep underground.

American geologists said that a domino effect of quakes could be caused by intense pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing, combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away.

The Columbia University scientists maintain that powerful earthquakes can trigger swarms of minor quakes near waste water injection wells like those used for in oil and gas recovery.

They say a recent surge in U.S. oil and gas production using vast amounts of water to crack open rocks and release natural shale gas has been linked to an increase in small to moderate induced earthquakes in five states.

Seismologists from the university have identified three quakes in Oklahoma, Colorado and Texas that they believe were triggered at injection well sites by a major earthquake a long distance away.

The discovery, published in the journal Science by one of the world's leading seismology labs, threatens to make fracking even more controversial.

A joint UK study of hydraulic fracturing by The Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering said that fracking can be managed effectively in the UK as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation.

The experts also said that earth tremors induced by hydraulic fracturing are likely to be of a smaller magnitude than the UK naturally experiences or than is related to coal mining activities.

The biggest earthquake on record to hit the UK was a 6.1 back in 1931.

Fortunately this one hit offshore and didn’t cause much damage on the mainland, but Ford says there is the possibility that one of this size could still hit the mainland UK.

‘We’re quite a distance from immediate fault lines, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge running up to Iceland.

‘But we do have a major plate tectonic boundary between the Eurasian plate and the African plate.

‘The African plate is rubbing up on the Eurasian plate, so that causes stresses that build up on existing fault lines the UK has.

‘Some could be a few metres long, some are long, but over time stresses build up.

‘Perhaps historically many millions of years ago they could have been more active.

‘I’m sure there were larger earthquakes at some time.'

Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates rub together. For places like the UK, we experience tremors from smaller fault lines that are susceptible to these larger plate movements

When these might occur though, or why these two were localised in Rutland, remains a mystery.

‘There is a possibility one of that size can hit the mainland UK,' Ford continues.

‘The unusual feature of earthquakes is we don’t know where they might occur.’

‘We don’t know why it was localised in Rutland.

‘There could be faults underground that we don’t know of.

‘In other parts of the world with earthquakes they don’t know of all the fault lines.

‘There could be lots of blind fault lines, we’ve got a long way to go to understand these processes through seismology.'

These could lead to larger earthquakes occurring on the mainland in future
