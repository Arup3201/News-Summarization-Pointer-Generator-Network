Two people are believed to have died and as many as seven wounded after a man armed with two semi-automatic handguns opened fire outside a psychiatric clinic on a bustling university campus.

Police said the shooter is among those killed outside the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

The University of Pittsburgh and nearby medical center, where the clinic is located, were on lockdown while police scoured the 17 floors of the facility.

Rampage: Seven people were injured when a gunman opened fire at the Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh

Among those hit was a University of Pittsburgh officer who was grazed on the leg while in the clinic's lobby and taken to hospital next door. The conditions of three others wounded are unknown.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said 'police acted admirably and did engage in gunfire'. 'There's no doubt that their swift response saved lives today,' he added.

Gregory Brant said he was in a waiting room on the first floor of the clinic building when chaos broke out.

'We heard a bunch of yelling, some shooting, people yelling, "Hide! Hide!"' he said. 'Everyone's yelling, "Stay down!"'

Injured: Police and paramedics carry one of the gunman's victims from Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic

Armed: Police head up De Soto Street towards the psychiatry institute

Prepared: A Pennsylvania State Police officer keeps watch over the back of clinic where at least nine were shot

Pandemonium: Police escort people across De Soto Street to safety

Brant, 53, and six other people, including a young girl and
her parents, barricaded themselves inside the waiting room during the ordeal which lasted around 20 minutes. But he said
they did not feel safe because there were doors with windows along 
adjacent walls.

'The way the room was arranged, if he
[the gunman] had gone to either window and would have seen us in there,
he could have done whatever he wanted,' Brant said.

The group crouched in a corner, 
hoping the gunman would not see them as he went past. The 
men in the group decided on the spot that if the gunman entered the 
room, they would rush him.

'We were kind of sitting ducks,' Brant said. 'Luckily, he didn't see us in there, and we didn't make eye contact with him.'

Initial reports of a second gunman on 
the loose were denied by police, who swarmed around the building, 
evacuated buildings and closed down nearby roads.

Scene: Police surround the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh, where a gunman opened fire

Safe: Nearby buildings, including an elementary and high school, were placed on lockdown

Evacuated: People leave the clinic, which is located in the Oakland neighbourhood of the city

Blocked: Police stop traffic reaching the street near the front entrance of the psychiatric clinic

A SWAT team swooped on the scene, while officers yelled at people to stay inside buildings.

UPMC and law enforcement officials 
declined to speculate on a motive for the shooting and said authorities 
were still sorting out which bullets from which guns inflicted which 
wounds.

The medical center said it had 
received patients from the shooting. It said two patients were in 
intensive care, two were released and three were being admitted. All 
were expected to survive.

Paul Wood, a spokesman for The 
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said: 'What we're worrying 
about right now is patient care and taking care of all the wounded 
people.'

Witnesses have claimed as hearing as 
many as 15 shots around the campus. Most students who live in 
accommodation near the scene are on spring break.

Safe: Police confirmed that one of the people shot dead was the gunman

Protection: A SWAT team swooped on the University of Pittsburgh area and closed off roads

Injuries: A bullet grazed the leg of a police inside the psychiatric clinic. He was taken to a hospital next door

Under control: It is believed there were fewer people around than normal as students are on spring break

The university sent out email and 
text alerts shortly after 2 p.m. to warn people of the shooting, saying:
'An active shooter has been identified at Western Psychiatric 
Institute. Several injured. Possible second actor in Western Psych. 
Lockdown recommended until further notice. If safe to do so, tell others
of this message.'

UPMC chief executive Jeffrey Romoff said the health network was 'deeply, deeply saddened by today's events" and expressed "deepest 
sympathy to the victims and their families.'

Ken 
Walters, spokesman for Carnegie Mellon University, told the 
Tribune-Review that an alert was sent to the 'campus community' 
detailing the Western Psych shooting and 'urging everyone to stay away 
from this area'.

Nearby elementary and high schools have also been ordered to go on lockdown. 'No one can leave or come in,' schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said.

Ben
Sciulli, owner of Milano's Pizza on Fifth Avenue, said clinic employees
were eating lunch inside his restaurant when they received phone calls 
from co-workers still inside the hospital.

'They texted to say they were hiding under tables,' Sciulli told the Tribune. 'They
were frightened. Everybody is frightened. There's not too many people 
out now, and there's usually a lot more people walking around.'

On
its website, the clinic describes itself as a top academic-based 
psychiatric care center. It is in the city's Oakland neighbourhood.

It is affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and one of several affiliated hospitals near to the campus.

Other universities are nearby, including Carnegie Mellon, Carlow and Chatham.
