Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weineris running for mayor of New York City, and he's back on Twitter, the social networking portal that destroyed his national political career. And Donald Trump is not amused.

'Sexting Pervert @anthonyweiner has returned to twitter,' Trump warned in a tweet on Tuesday. 'Parents of all underage girls should BLOCK him immediately!'

In a second zinger, the Celebrity Apprentice star and real estate mogul asked the question that's now on New Yorkers' minds: 'Will @anthonyweiner be fully clothed in his mayoral ads?'

The Donald has never been accused of keeping his thoughts to himself, and Anthony Weiner could be a casualty of the Celebrity Apprentice's massive reach on Twitter

A contrite Weiner announced his resignation from Congress on June 16, 2011 following an earlier press conference where he admitted sextng a series of women over three years

This isn't the first time The Donald has tweeted his outrage at Weiner's re-entry into politics at a high level. 'Sexual pervert Anthony Weiner has zero business holding public office,' he tweeted two weeks ago.

In July 2012 when Weiner popped out from hiding to test the mayoral waters, Trump warned that 'he's a sexual pervert & they can never be healed.'

He also advised Huma Abedin, Weiner's wife, that she 'should drop him before it happens again.'

The 'it' is a reference to the scandal that plummeted Weiner from the heights of national political popularity after he tweeted suggestive private messages to several young women not named Huma Abedin. The two had been married for less than a year when the scandal developed.

Donald Trump resumed his tweet-beating of Anthony Weiner on Tuesday, taking jabs at his mayoral aspirations

If Weiner were to go bare-chested in his ads, Trump would certainly yell, 'You're Fired!' - but few New York City voters say they plan to give him a chance

Weiner's exit from the political stage began when one tweet was found to contain a photograph of his erect penis straining against his underwear. He mistakenly sent it as a public tweet instead of a private message, showing millions of Americans what he was doing in his spare time and, some said, from his Capitol Hill office.

Another photo unveiled later showed a bare-chested Weiner photographing himself in front of a mirror.

Weiner claimed for weeks that his Twitter account had been hacked, but he was dogged all the way by conservative media raconteur Andrew Breitbart, who demanded his resignation daily and insisted that his deception made him unfit for office.

The liberal Democrat ultimately stepped down from the House of Representatives in June 2011 after serving nearly seven terms, offering an apology to his constituents - and to Breitbart personally.  He had remained largely out of the public eye since then.

The tweet heard 'round the world showed Weiner's genitals, and was meant for a female admirer, but he mistakenly sent it as a message that the world could see. The bare-chested selfie emerged later when a woman who shared it with Andrew Breitbart's website said Weiner emailed it to her

In the months following his resignation, the disgraced former congressman stayed out of the public eye, appearing only a few times on the street of New York with his wife, Huma Abedin, and their son Jordan

In a circus-like 2011 press conference, Weiner admitted that he had 'exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years.'

Those women included the pornographic actress Ginger Lee, a Las Vegas blackjack dealer, and a 26-year-old single mother from Texas.

Breitbart died tragically of a heart attack the following February.

Weiner has kept his tweeting to a minimum since rejoining the network under a new handle - @anthonyweiner instead of @RepWeiner.

The most recent of his only three tweets advocates that New York City employees who use tobacco should be forced to pay higher health insurance premiums than their nonsmoking colleagues.

A representative for Trump didn't respond to an email seeking comment. Weiner's attorney and representative also didn't return a phone call.

In his darkest days, constituents were echoing calls for his resignation. This sign, hoisted outside a car in front of Weiner's ueens, New York home, read, 'Fit for Congress? Resign now!'

Trump, shown in the April 2013 All Star Celebrity Apprentice broadcast, may have the last laugh since his Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, reaches more than 2.1 million readers

But the former congressman wil have an uphill climb if he wants to succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A recent poll showed that just 16 per cent of New Yorkers would vote for him, compared to 25 per cent support for City Council Speaker Christine Quinn.

A separate poll indicated that more than half of registered Democrats would not even consider voting for him.

In July 2012, Trump tweeter that when he was 'in his prime, I predicted that @RepWeiner would never be mayor & I was right for all of the wrong reasons.'
