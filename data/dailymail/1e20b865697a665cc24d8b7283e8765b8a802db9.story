A group of conservatives are banding together in the House to oppose Ohio Republican John Boehner's reelection to Speaker in retaliation for a budget deal leadership supported at the end of last year.

A half dozen Republicans, including Reps. Steve King of Iowa and David Brat of Virginia, have said they won't vote for Boehner in tomorrow's speaker election. Texas lawmaker Louie Gohmert on Sunday put his name forth as a challenger.

Boehner has little chance of losing the gavel, as it would take a defection of nearly 30 members of his caucus to put his position in jeopardy. The last time disgruntled conservatives and tea partiers tried to take out their party leader, they ultimately mustered just 10 Republican votes against him.

'Rep. Boehner was selected as the House Republican Conference's choice for Speaker in November, and he expects to be elected by the whole House next week,' the congressman's spokesman, Michael Steel, said in a statement, writing off the insurgent effort.

Still, the vote will be a key indicator of just how much negotiating it will take for House Republican leaders to keep their members in line over the next several months as party gets its first opportunity in Democratic President Barack Obama's tenure to sideline him.

Beginning tomorrow, Republicans will make up majorities in both chambers of Congress for the first time since Obama was elected after picking up nine additional Senate seats in November.

No sooner had the votes from the midterm elections been tallied before Republicans were arguing among themselves about what to do with their new powers.

The first preview of Republican leadership of Congress came in mid December when the legislative body was under the gun to pass appropriations legislation or see the government shut down.

The House was only able to pass a $1.1 trillion compromise spending bill that funded the government through the end of the fiscal year, with the exception of Homeland Security, which it put on a shorter leash, after President Obama rallied Democrats to support the measure.

Conservatives in the House refused to attach their names to the bill over ire at Obama for giving millions of illegal immigrants safe haven in the U.S.

Had they had it their way, the bill would have included language restricting the Obama administration from using immigration funds to register illegal residents of the country for work permits. 

Alternatively, conservatives lobbied for legislation that would have short-term funded the entire government through February, giving their party more leverage over Obama once Republicans elected in November were seated in Congress.

Boehner's decision to join forces with the opposition party to pass the spending bill didn't sit well with conservatives, and over the holiday break separating the previous legislative session with the 114th Congress, they began plotting a rebellion. 

'While I like Speaker Boehner personally, he will not have my support for Speaker,' Brat said in an op-ed in Breitbart News.

'Our current leadership was recently tested when Mr. Obama attempted to circumvent Congress and the law by unilaterally granting amnesty to illegal immigrants by presidential decree. His decree provides illegal immigrants with work permits, legal status, and free federal entitlements. But on a much more significant front, his action shows a complete disregard for our constitutional system where Congress makes the laws and the president's duty is to enforce them.

The recently elected lawmaker, who defeated former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary election last summer and joined Congress early after Cantor resigned, blasted Boehner for allowing funding for 'illegal amnesty' to be allowed in the spending bill and for going to House Democrats to get the votes he needed instead of members of his own party.

'Washington is broken in part because our party's leadership has strayed from its own principles of free market, limited government, constitutional conservatism,' Brat wrote.

Texas lawmaker Louie Gohmert said Sunday that he would challenge Boehner unless a more viable Republican jumps in the race. 'At this point, the Speaker’s election is not about a particular candidate,' he said. 'It is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands'

On Sunday, in announcing his candidacy for speaker, Gohmert also cited the spending bill controversy.

'After the November elections gave Republicans control of the Senate, voters made clear they wanted change.

'There have been numerous examples of problematic Republican leadership, but we were hopeful our leaders got the voters’ message. However, after our Speaker forced through the CRomnibus by passing it with Democratic votes and without time to read it, it seemed clear that we needed new leadership,' he stated.

Gohmert said that he'd 'heard from many supporters and also friends in Congress who have urged me to put forward my name for Speaker... to increase our chances of change' yet said he'd be open to voting for another one of his colleagues instead.

'At this point, the Speaker’s election is not about a particular candidate. It is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands,' he said.

'I am putting forward my name for consideration as Speaker and hope that with a new Speaker, be that me or someone else, we can fight for the ideals and principles that the voters wanted when they elected us in November.'

Florida congressman Ted Yoho, one of a cadre of Republicans who voted against Boehner in the last election for speaker, provided similar reasons for his resistance to the Ohio lawmaker's reelection.

'Our vote for a new Speaker is not a personal vote against Representative Boehner—it is a vote against the status quo,' he said in a Facebook post. 'Our vote is a signal to the American people that we too, have had enough of Washington politics, and that we will stand with the American people.'

In this Jan. 5, 2011 photo, House Speaker-designate John Boehner of Ohio wipes away tears as he waits to receive the gavel from outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., during the first session of the 112th Congress, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Boehner was unanimously elected to speaker by Republicans four years ago today

So far, North Carolina's Walter Jones, Kentucky's Thomas Massie, Oklahoma's Jim Bridenstine and Iowa's King are the only other Republicans to say they would not vote for Boehner tomorrow.

'We need a Speaker who will help us all keep our oath, including his own, to the Constitution, not one who has consistently blocked our efforts to keep ours,' King said in a statement. 'I will vote for an alternative candidate for Speaker. I can't vote for John Boehner again.'

However, a handful of new representatives that include Barry Loudermilk and Jody Hice of Georgia, John Ratcliffe of Texas, Gary Palmer of Alabama and Mark Walker of North Carolina have suggested in the past that they would not support Boehner.

And Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, New Mexico Rep. Steve Pearce, Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp and Arizona lawmakers Paul Gosar and Matt Salmon have all voted against Boehner in a past election or recently expressed dissatisfaction with his leadership.

Republicans hold a 246-seat majority in the House and Boehner only needs 218 votes to prevail over Democratic Party leader Nancy Pelosi and his conservative challengers if all 435 Members of Congress were to vote tomorrow.

One vote that will go uncast is that of New York Rep. Michael Grimm, whose resignation takes effect today.

Other members of both political parties could show their agitation with their side's leaders by abstaining. But refusing to vote merely lowers the threshold for reaching a consensus.

At the start of the 113th Congress Boehner received 220 votes for speaker and Pelosi garnered 192. But only 426 members voted, making 214 votes necessary to reach a majority.

If Boehner hadn't won outright, voting would have gone to a second round, giving conservatives an opportunity to ignite a revolution.
