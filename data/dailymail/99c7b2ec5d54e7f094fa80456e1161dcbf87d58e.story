Racing pundit John McCririck pleaded with Clare Balding to help him get his job back after being sacked by Channel 4, a tribunal heard yesterday.

The 73-year-old twice asked Miss Balding, who led the new-look coverage, to hold meetings on his behalf with the station’s creative controller, Jay Hunt.

But his attempts failed in part because Miss Hunt, a former BBC One controller, was a ‘serial age discrimination offender’, he told the hearing.

Discrimination claim: John McCririck, 73, pictured with his wife Jenny - who he has called 'The Booby' - arrives at the central London employment tribunal today. He is suing for £3million

McCririck is seeking £3 million compensation, alleging Channel 4 axed him in 2012 after 29 years because of his age.

The Harrow-educated presenter accepted that his ‘brand’ was that of a ‘big, fat, sexist, letch’.

He admitted there had been plenty of complaints to Channel 4 about his behaviour, and he accepted descriptions of him as ‘nasty, revolting, rude’, ‘boorish’ and ‘obnoxious and sexist’.

But he said: ‘I was fully aware Channel 4 approved of it because they kept on having me on their programmes.’

Flamboyant: McCririck, known for his bling, sideburns and deerstalker, claims he is still able to cover horse racing and denies appearances on Celebrity Big Brother have detracted from his seriousness

He claimed Channel 4 had encouraged him to promote himself that way as part of his ‘pantomime villain’ act.

And he insisted he had called for more women presenters on Channel 4 Racing – despite once describing one of them as the ‘lay of the day’ live on air and nicknaming others the ‘saucy minx’ and ‘the pouty heiress’.

He also referred to 42-year-old Miss Balding as ‘ravishing’ until she objected to the description.

Despite this, McCririck approached Miss Balding for help after losing his job when the racing contract was awarded to production company IMG Media.

He said: ‘Before this legal action, at my request, she tried to arrange a face to face discussion last December and then again, in January with Miss Hunt who she knew from working together at the BBC.’

But the meetings never happened because Miss Hunt and Channel 4 head of sport Jamie Aitchison had already ‘made their decision’, McCririck alleged.

'Peace talks': Clare Balding tried to act as a go-between and act as peacemaker after McCririck was axed by Channel 4 last year, he said

He said: ‘That was final. Courtesy, and at least giving the victim a personal hearing and opportunity to put their case, meant nothing.’

McCririck was accused of ‘grandstanding’ by Channel 4 barrister Thomas Linden QC during a lively appearance at the Central London Employment Tribunal.

The pundit claimed he was the most important member of the Channel 4 Racing team, comparing himself to a star footballer.

He also described his love of breasts, explaining: ‘I happen to sadly be someone who likes the female front structure.’

And he told of his attraction to Dawn French and Kate Winslet, adding: ‘I don’t think I’ve got much of a chance.’

Horse racing pundit John McCririck said he has put his home at risk to bring his age discrimination case against Channel 4.

The 73 year-old, who lives with 
his wife Jenny in Primrose Hill, north London, said if he lost the case 
it would be 'disastrous'.

He told the tribunal: 'We had to take out a mortgage equity release to pay for our case.

'It is a huge expense. My home is now on the line because of this. I believe what I’m doing is right.'

The pundit is suing the broadcaster for £3million.

He added: 'I
have put my own personal future on the line.

'But I think it’s so 
important for people in their 30’s up to their 70’s who fear anonymous 
suits and skirts coming along and getting rid of them.'

The tribunal heard McCririck had been warned by his bosses that his forays into reality TV, including Celebrity Big Brother, were harming his journalistic career.

But he said: ‘Channel 4…enjoyed and encouraged my media antics. It is all part of the media game.

‘In particular I was expected to play up to the role in which I had been cast – a sort of pantomime villain – which is how some sections of the media and public have tended to see me over the years.

‘I would not have taken on these other commitments if Channel 4 executives had disapproved.

‘If anyone had ever been concerned, or believed I should change, they only had to discuss the issue with me. They never did.’

McCririck added: ‘No one did more for women than I did on Channel 4 Racing. Time and again I said why haven’t we got more women on the programme, why do we have all these boring men?’

He
said in a statement: 'At the BBC Clare Balding approached me through intermediaries 
asking me to work alongside her at the racing at the BBC. She wanted me 
to join her.

He added: 'We 
regularly chatted about the prospects, tactics and what role I advised 
her to take up along with conditions and terms to seek before agreeing 
to sign up.

'We go back, I believe as mutual admirers, for 25 years.'

He added: 'Long 
before Ms Balding became the national treasure she now is I was a huge 
admirer of her natural talent, wide ranging knowledge of countless 
issues, spontaneous repartee and communication skills.

Admitting he was a 'taxi for hire' from 2010 after his days on Channel 4 were cut to just 40 a year, McCririck said he had pursued appearances on reality TV.

'Discrimination': McCririck, 73, revealed he has put his home in Primrose Hill, north London, at risk to fight the tribunal claim

But he said his persona as a 'bombastic and domineering' individual was a pantomime character that he would have reined in if he had been asked.

'When I came out of Celebrity Big Brother in 2005 to all the howling and catcalling, Davina McCall said, "don’t worry John it’s all pantomime". That’s all it was, not serious,' he said.

'This is a different persona, you are putting on a performance, you are doing a pantomime act.'

The tribunal was told of several occasions McCririck had been acting in a way he accepted was seen as a sexist and a bigot, including incidents in the Big Brother house.

On another occasion he was thrown off Alan Titchmarsh’s ITV show for making rude comments to Ingrid Tarrant about her relationship with her then estranged husband Chris Tarrant.

And he refers to his wife Jenny - who was supporting him at the hearing - as 'The Booby', because she was 'not very bright, squawks a lot and was easy to catch'.

In action: Clare Balding, who moved to Channel 4 from the BBC, led a new-look team that was brought in after McCririck was axed

Former Channel 4 racing presenter Lesley Graham later said she had her hours slashed in 2009 after 18 years with the broadcaster because she was about to turn 50.

She said she was left 'angry' and 'disappointed' by the move and found denials of ageism by Andrew Thompson, Channel 4’s head of sport, 'hard to believe'.

She said in a statement to the tribunal: 'In December 2009 Andrew Thompson telephoned me and told me that he was going to reduce my days from 40 to 15.

'I had no notice that this was going to happen and was extremely surprise and disappointed.

'I was shocked and didn’t fully understand the reasons for this. The only reason I could think that my annual days were being reduced was because of my age - I was due to turn 50 in 2010.'

She said she was 'effectively replaced' by Emma Spencer and Alice Plunkett, who were 31 and 36 respectively, at the time.

He also praised the ‘bravery’ of Miriam 
O’Reilly who sued the BBC for sex and age discrimination in 2010 after 
she and three other women in their 40s and 50s were dropped from 
Countryfile when Miss Hunt was BBC One controller.

Channel 4 and IMG Media deny age discrimination. The tribunal continues.
