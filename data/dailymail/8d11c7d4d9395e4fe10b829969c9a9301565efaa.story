A mother whose two toddlers drowned in a backyard Californian swimming pool has been sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of child endangerment.

Tassie Behrens, 28, said she woke up at just before 10am on May 13, 2013, and found her children, two-year-old Jason Bradford and his 16-month-old sister, Harley, in the pool, floating and unresponsive. 

Both children were taken to hospital but later died.

The court heard how Behrens was under the influence of methamphetamine and her older child may have tried unsuccessfully to wake her up when he was unable to find his sister.

Tassie Anne Behrens, 28, pleaded guilty in July to a pair of felony child endangerment charges. Her two toddlers drowned in a swimming pool at a friend's home near Mount Helix, California while she slept

In sentencing Behrens to prison, the judge said that the child victims were 'particularly vulnerable,' that the defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine when the accident happened, and that Behrens initially lied to police about where the accident took place

Court documents stated that the boy's clothes were found near the edge of the pool, suggesting that he jumped into the pool to save his sister.

Behrens confirmed to investigators that  her son Jason woke her up at 8am that morning to ask for his sister, but she was so drugged-up she fell back to sleep.

When she finally awoke, Behrens found both her children floating face down in the swimming pool at 9:45am. Her daughter, Harley, was pronounced dead just before 10.30am.  

Two-year-old Jason was taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he died later that night.

In denying Behrens probation, Judge Laura Halgren said the defendant did not plead guilty to causing the death of her children, but that she put them in a very dangerous situation by having them stay of the home of a friend, Larry Dangelo, where marijuana was being grown and wires were exposed. 

Prosecutors said a dismantled honey oil lab was downstairs in a garage.

Fateful decision: Behrens (right) and a male friend decided to drive her dying kids to a fire station instead of a hospital because she was afraid to get the man in trouble

In sentencing Behrens to prison, Halgren said that the child victims were 'particularly vulnerable,' that the defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine when the accident happened, and that Behrens initially lied to police about where the accident took place 

Her defense attorney Tom Carnessale -- arguing for probation -- told the judge that Behrens, a meth addict, was not happy with her children having to live in various homes and even thought about going to court and asking about foster care.

Carnesale said the children were healthy and not abused.

Stressed: Behrens wrote on her Facebook page about her struggles of raising two young children on her own

Tall tale: Behrens initially told police that the drownings occurred at a mobile park, but later admitted that it took place at the La Mesa home

In the weeks leading up to the tragedy, posts on Behren's Facebook page painted a portrait of a young woman who had been struggling with the responsibilities of raising two children on her own.

'This is so crazy chasing after 2 babies when I cannot even walk on my own,' she wrote. 'At least I can take cast on and off.If anyone feels like helping me by giving me a break from chasing kids around feel free to message me.lol'

The despairing mom who was 26 at the time of the incident lamented that no one offered her a helping hand, and she has vowed to do 'absolutely everything' on her own.

'Its [sic]only me n[sic] my two babies. the loves of my life,' Behrens wrote.

The  mother initially lied to officials by saying that the children were found in a pool in a Spring Valley mobile home park, but later admitted that they were discovered at the Le Mesa home.

Larry Dangelo, 44, who lives at the Sunset Avenue residence along with another man, was later arrested on suspicion of running a marijuana-growing operation out of the basement at the house.

At least 60 marijuana plants and drug-making equipment were seized by members of the regional Narcotics Task Force.

A search of the home uncovered a marijuana-growing operation and the Narcotics Task Force was called in.
