A school worker has been jailed for 10 years for abusing two young girls and downloading more than 12,000 vile pornographic images after being shopped to police by his horrified wife.

IT assistant Frederick Brookes, 62, plied his innocent victims - both under the age of 10 - with sweets and biscuits before indulging his sick fantasies.

Brookes helped teach hundreds of children at a school in the New Forest, Hants. He even groomed a third girl to help him take video footage of one of the distressed victims, who was tied up and naked.

'A parent's worst nightmare': IT assistant Frederick Brookes, 62, was

girls treats

He was eventually shopped to the police after his wife became suspicious about him giving the girls treats.

Judge Gary Burrell QC, who had to view the disturbing pictures at Southampton Crown Court, said they were some of the worst he had seen during his 30-year legal career.

Passing sentence, Judge Burrell said: 'What you did to those girls was truly abhorrent.

'You breached the trust of their parents and your abuse has left their families quite distraught and you have damaged those children as well.

'You are in my opinion a parent’s worst nightmare.

'It is clear from the parents you were someone they trusted, as well they might because you were a pillar of the community.'

One of Brookes’ victims suffers nightmares following her ordeal, and remains terrified that he will come and get her.

Her parents say they feel totally betrayed by Brookes’ actions and feel they can no longer trust anyone.

The
second girl’s parents said their once outgoing and confident daughter 
was now too scared to sleep on her own and had become withdrawn.

Prosecutor James Newton-Price told the court that Brookes had met his wife in 2001 when teaching in India and she was a student.

They married and moved to the United Kingdom, but she became concerned when he began giving the youngsters so many sweets and biscuits.

Last year, she asked one girl if he had done anything to her. Initially the young girl said ‘no’ but later went on to reveal that he had.

Brookes denied it, but the next day Mrs Brookes spoke to the girls’ parents and the police were called.

When questioned, Brookes admitted he had played with the children but denied touching them.

Asked if detectives would find any sexual images on his computer, Brookes replied: 'Oh, God, no'.

All his sickening images had been deleted or encrypted, but police officers managed to recover them.

Five moving images had been broken down frame-by-frame to show 196 still images of one of the girls he had filmed tied up.

The school worker had also downloaded more than 12,000 other pornographic images of children.

Nearly 1,000 were at the most serious level and featured sadism.

In police interview, Brookes, of New Milton, said he felt embarrassed and disgusted with himself and needed help.

He admitted six counts of sexual assault and 18 charges of making indecent images. None of his victims attended the school where he worked.

Judge Burrell also banned Brookes from accessing children and the internet, placed him on the sex offenders’ register and disqualified him from working with children - all for life.

In mitigation, Rebecca Austin said Brookes, of previous good character, had shown regret and remorse.

She said: 'He has lost everything: his wife, his job, his home.

'He has also lost his good reputation and he has no friends. He has been suffering from depression and taking medication for it.

'He was not doing it for financial gain and has not shared the images with anyone.'
