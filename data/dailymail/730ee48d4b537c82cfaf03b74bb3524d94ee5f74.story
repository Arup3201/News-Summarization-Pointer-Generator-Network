The family of an airman who crashed during World War Two finally found the site where he met his death, only to discover it is to be cleared and turned into a housing estate without allowing experts to search for bodies or the wreckage of the plane.

Flight engineer Ronald Barton, 34, and his seven comrades were flying their final mission over Germany in 1944 when they crashed while on their way home.

The precise location of the crash site near the town of Cloppenburg, in northern Germany was lost after the war and was only found recently after a lengthy search by Mr Barton's surviving relatives and by making contact with people who lived nearby as children. 

Debbie Bartlett (left) searched with her sister Julie Barton to track down the exact crash site where their grandfather died after his Lancaster bomber crashed during World War Two. The sisters found the site by speaking to people who lived nearby, such as Herr Heuerman (right) and left roses for the airmen who died 

However, when Mr Barton's family finally located the field farmer's field in the village of Staatsforten, near Varrelbusch, they found parts of the land had already been cleared to make way for a housing estate.

They met people who had lived near to the crash site who remain convinced that bodies and discarded parts of the plane are still in the ground.  

The land is due to be dug up with mechanical diggers next Monday - without allowing archaeologists the opportunity to search for bodies and parts of the wreckage.

Julie Barton, 52, and her younger sister Debbie Bartlett, 48, spent more than 18 months tirelessly tracking down the precise site where their grandfather died.

Flight engineer Ronald Barton perished in the crash

The Royal Australian Air Force helped the sisters track down the site, along with aviation archaeologists who spoke to people who had lived in the area at the time of the crash. The sisters visited the field last week, laying eight roses for the airmen who died there.

They also met people who had seen the burning wreckage of the Lancaster bomber set fire to their neighbouring farm when they were children.

The bodies of two Bomber Command airmen were recovered from the plane by German soldiers after the crash but the six others who perished are still believed to be in the ground, along with the wreckage.

Ms Barton said: 'The eye witnesses we met are convinced there are still people in the ground and lots of the plane.

'The German authorities have an ordnance team going in to check there are no unexploded bombs in the ground and then they are sending in bulldozers to tear up the ground.

'We are very anxious to trace family members of the rest of the crew so that we can urge the Germans to treat the site with sensitivity and ensure that it is examined carefully for any remains of the lost crew members including our grandfather.

'We have had limited help or encouragement from the British authorities, and we feel time is running out to ensure that the excavation is carefully undertaken and that local archaeologists are fully involved.'

The sisters said they wanted any remains to receive a fitting burial and any parts of the plane found to be displayed in a museum. 

Their grandfather left behind a 10-year-old son when he died. 

The crash site in a remote field in Germany has already started to be cleared to make way for housing 

The site of the accident is pictured just days after the crash, but details of its location was soon lost 

Days after the accident people are pictured searching the wreckage after eight airmen died in the crash

On October 6, 1944, Lancaster PD214 set off from RAF Metheringham in Lincolnshire on what was meant to be the crew's last operational mission - a bombing raid on the German industrial city of Bremen.

But the plane lost contact with the base and it was eventually recorded as missing. The International Red Cross reported that the plane had crashed and that the Germans had recovered two bodies.

In 1946 an RAF investigation team exhumed the two bodies and identified them as Australian Trainee Pilot Flight Lieutenant John Colclough Barlow, 35, and Rear Gunner Sergeant Ronald James Paul, 20.

The crash site today looks very different from when the plane crashed and exploded during World War Two

They are both buried in Becklingen War Cemetery.

The other six men who were on board that night were all listed as having 'no known grave' and are remembered at the RAF memorial in Runnymede.

Ms Barton, from Beddau, South Wales, said: 'It was their 30th and final bombing mission as a crew. As far as we know they dropped their bombs and were on their way home when they crashed.

'Eye witnesses at the crash site said they could hear the bombing from their farm 40 miles away and then it went quiet.

'Then they heard this odd engine noise and in the pitch black a bomber suddenly dropped out of nowhere and exploded - creating four large burning craters.

A telegram sent in 1944 informs Mrs Barton that her husband was missing in action after the final mission 

Mr Barton's wife was sent a letter in 1945 telling her that her husband was still being classified as 'missing' 

'Children nearby came and played on the site in the days after.

'They found an embroidered handkerchief with Barlow stitched on it and a flying boot with my grandfather's name on it.'

Pilot Flt Lt Douglas Stewart, 29; Navigator Flt Sgt George Bowering Kirby, 22; Wireless Operator Gordon Stuart Grogan; Canadian Bomb Aimer Pilot Officer Clyde James Royal, 31; and Mid Upper Gunner Flt. Sgt James Anthony Fell, 21, were the missing men. 

The sisters said they had been able to track down the site thanks to the help of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

Some parts of the plane were recovered from the crash site, but residents believe there is more to be found

Trainee Pilot Flight Lieutenant John Colclough Barlow, 35, and Rear Gunner Sergeant Ronald James Paul, 20, were recovered by the Germans after they died and were buried in Becklingen War Cemetery

Mr Barton and his colleagues were remembered on a war memorial in Swansea after the plane crash 

She said: 'An RAF investigation team went to village in 1946 and were shown where the two recovered bodies were buried and identified them a crew members.

'There were eight men aboard that night because they had an Australian trainee pilot with them.

'Luckily, because there was an Australian aboard we could get lots of information from the RAAF about the crash report which the RAF wouldn't give us because of data sensitivity about other crew members.

'But even with the crash report we lacked an exact position for the crash.'
