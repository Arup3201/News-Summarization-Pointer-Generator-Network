Jenson Button's manager has hinted that the 2009 world champion is ready to turn his back on Formula One.

McLaren are openly pursuing a reunion with Fernando Alonso, who left so acrimoniously after his spat with Lewis Hamilton in 2007.

Should the British team sign the Spaniard, who is leaving Ferrari after five years, it is likely to spell the end for Button with McLaren expected to stand by their young protege Kevin Magnussen.

Button, 34, has more points than his team-mate, but has been outqualified in nine of the 16 races so far, and was urged to ‘try harder’ by chairman Ron Dennis ahead of July’s British Grand Prix.

‘McLaren aren’t sure what they’re doing and what their line-up will be,’ said Button’s long-serving manager Richard Goddard.

‘Jenson is an incredibly competitive racing driver who wants to race.

‘He’s too good to sit at the back of the F1 grid, so he either gets a competitive car in F1 or he goes to get one elsewhere.’

One alternative for the Englishman, a 15-time race winner, is the world endurance championship, the series Mark Webber defected to after retiring from F1 last year.

It is understood the 34-year-old has already held talks with Porsche.

‘Jenson is still focused on F1 but would only want to be in one of the top teams. So we’re always open to talking to anyone,’ added Goddard.

‘The world endurance championship is a formidable series that is gaining strength and Mark going there has added a lot.’

l Pirelli have changed their tyre choice for the Brazilian Grand Prix after Felipe Massa branded their original decision ‘dangerous’ and ‘totally unacceptable’.

After consulting with all 11 teams, they will now run the soft and medium compounds at the recently resurfaced Interlagos track.
