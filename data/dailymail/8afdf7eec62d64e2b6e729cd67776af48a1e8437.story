Judges’ copies of the leading Oscar and Bafta contenders – 12 Years A Slave, Gravity and American Hustle – have leaked on to the web for illegal download.

The pirated versions of the films appear to have originally been sent to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who decide the winners of the Oscars, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. There are around 6,000 people in each.

The illicit copy of the sci-fi epic Gravity includes the warning: ‘This secure screener is on loan for you, the member’ – the same message appearing on the films sent to Bafta members towards the end of last year.

Warning: This message appears on an illegal copy of Saving Mr Banks - the same note that flashes up on preview copies of movies for people who pick Oscar and BAFTA winners

The pirated versions of comedy drama American Hustle include a screen alert that reads: ‘For Your Consideration Only.’ And the copy of 12 Years A Slave is marked ‘Property of Fox. May not be copied or transferred or sold.’

The three films, which are competing for Best Film at the Oscars and the Baftas, have only just been released into cinemas and are not yet available on DVD.

Several other award contenders are also available on the same pirate sites, including The Wolf  Of Wall Street, Saving Mr Banks and The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug.

The copy of The Wolf Of Wall Street contains the on-screen message that this version is ‘For Awards Consideration’.

Many of the films also carry a warning that ‘an invisible water mark’ has been embedded in the movie, on the disc and even in the packaging, any of which can be used to identify who it was sent to.

Leaked: American Hustle is one of the films pirated on the web, along with 12 Years A Slave and Gravity

Studios have warned judges that unauthorised distribution of the films could lead to ‘civil and criminal penalties’. They have even advised on how to destroy the DVDs once the awards season has drawn to a close on March 2.

One Bafta source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Most members take the responsibility very seriously but the problem arises when a film is lent out to a family member or if a family member takes it without permission.’

It cannot be established whether the leak was definitely from Bafta or Oscar voters.

Bodies such as the Screen Actors Guild, which presented its awards last night, are also believed to send out films.

The Mail on Sunday has decided not to identify the pirate sites but some film fans have already tweeted their joy at finding them.

One wrote: ‘Bless Awards Screeners’ and another added: ‘I down loaded all of em last night, marathon viewing going on.’
