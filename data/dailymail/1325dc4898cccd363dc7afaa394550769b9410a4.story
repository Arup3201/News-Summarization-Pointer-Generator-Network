French police made at least 77 arrests in Paris tonight as an illegal demonstration against their alleged brutality exploded into violence.

It followed the death of ecology campaigner Remi Fraisse, 21, who was killed by a police grenade a week ago during clashes at the site of a dam project in the south west of the country.

Today organisers of the gathering in Paris urged protestors to 'wear crash helmets', as thousands of CRS riot squad officers flooded the city.

By late afternoon, fighting had broken out around the Stalingrad metro station, where the meeting started soon after 3pm.

'There are hundreds of rioters who are determined to attack the police,' said one officer at the scene.

'We will do everything possible to restore order, and make sure that members of the public are kept safe'.

But protestors accused the police of 'extreme brutality', saying they were using exactly the same tactics which led to Mr Fraisse's death.

'They are attacking us with batons and with projectiles,' said Sandrine Bisset, a 19-year-old student.

'The CRS riot police act like thugs - if they see the slightest sign of trouble then they just attack everyone.'

Manuel Valls, the Prime Minister of France, condemned the trouble 'with firmness', saying it was 'an insult to the memory of Remi Fraisse'.

Remi Fraisse death last Sunday was the first in a mainland France protest since 1986, and has been blamed on a concussion grenade fired by police.

France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve came under pressure to resign following the incident,

He announced an immediate end to the use of the grenades, which are intended to stun rather than to kill.

Mr Fraisse was one of 2,000 activists protesting against the £7m Sivens dam project, which they believed would case huge ecological damage. Following the trouble, work on the scheme has now been suspended.

Today's trouble is another huge test for French President Francois Hollande's increasingly troubled government, as it faces up to a deepening national crisis.

President Hollande's popularity is currently at a record low of 13 per cent, as France's economy stagnates, and millions complain about his Socialist government.
