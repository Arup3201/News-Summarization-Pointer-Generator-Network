Paul Pogba might be one Europe's most wanted but he was shown by Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri that he still has a thing or two to learn in training on Thursday.

Pogba and Allegri took each other on in a mini goal challenge. Standing at each end of the pitch, they had to hit the back of the net without the ball bouncing.

With Pogba's range of passing and clinical accuracy, one would expect the France international to surge ahead of his manager.

But it was quite the opposite.

Allegri, a midfielder in his playing days who represented Napoli, eased ahead of Pogba and with the score at 3-2 to the coach, they agreed to play until someone got to five.

Pogba turned to an onlooker and joked that beating Allegri may not be the wisest thing for him to do.

'I can't win, I can't win,' Pogba claimed. 'He's the boss!'

Pogba has been in superb form for Juventus this season and is one of Europe's most coveted talents

Allegri then sumptuously picked out the goal with ease and chirped to Pogba: 'All good, Paul? How's it going?'

And he then duly struck the fifth to win 5-2 against one of the hottest properties in global football. 

Allegri's winning mentality has taken Juventus to the top of Serie A, where they have a seven-point lead over their nearest challengers, Roma.
