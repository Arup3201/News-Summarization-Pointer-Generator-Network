The U.S. economy was today boosted again as the labour market continues to firm up, with the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits falling unexpectedly last week.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 15,000 to a seasonally-adjusted 358,000, and the four-week moving average for new claims fell 11,000 to 366,250, the U.S. Labor Department said.

The average figure, seen as a better measure of labour market trends, is now at its lowest level since April 2008. The initial claims measure is close behind, at its second-lowest level in almost four years.

‘It does look like with these numbers that the labour market is on a positive footing,’ New York analyst Sean Incremona said. ‘Job creation is probably going to be what keeps this recovery alive.’

‘Things do seem to be holding up somewhat better than we had expected,’ the 4Cast expert added.

The data points to building strength in the labour market. There have been two straight months of job gains above 200,000 and the jobless rate dropped to a three-year low of 8.3 per cent in January.

Solid gains in employment and manufacturing are suggesting against a sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter of 2012 after a brisk 2.8 per cent annual pace in the final three months of 2011.

IFR Economics analyst Vimombi Nshom said: ‘Even though claims have had bumpy readings, the average has fallen more consistently. So, less people are looking into unemployment benefits.’

The upbeat data is raising doubts about the Federal Reserve's expectation of holding interest rates near zero at least to 2014 and reduced the odds of more bond buying to spur the U.S. recovery.

Last week's decline in both new applications for jobless benefits and the four-week average pushed them closer to the 350,000 mark that would signal sustained labour market strength.

‘It's great news,’ said futures analyst Frank Lesh, of Futurepath Trading in Chicago, Illinois. ‘Claims continue to look better every week, every month - the headline number is great.’

Despite the continued improvement, the labour market still has a long away to go. Almost 24million Americans are out of work or underemployed. There is no job for three in every four jobless people.

One reason the jobless rate has fallen 
for five straight months is many people no longer looking for work. The 
government only counts people as unemployed if they are actively 
searching for a job.

Wall Street: U.S. stocks opened higher on Thursday after Greek leaders agreed to cost-cutting measures that should prevent the country from defaulting on its debt next month

Jacob Oubina, of RBC Capital Markets in New York, warned: ‘The seasonal volatility from around the holidays is going to disappear so we'll have a much cleaner set of numbers in the weeks ahead.’

Most economists expect growth will slow slightly in the January to March quarter, because companies won't need to rebuild their stockpiles of goods as much as they did in the winter.

But some economists are increasingly optimistic that the economy will steadily expand this year, given last month's unexpectedly large job gains and other positive signs.

U.S. stocks opened higher on Thursday after Greek leaders agreed to cost-cutting measures that should prevent the country from defaulting on its debt next month, before falling back later in the day.

The Dow Jones pushed to within 75 points of 13,000 but closed up seven points at 12,890. The S&P 500 finished up two points at 1,352 and the Nasdaq climbed 11 points to 2,927.
