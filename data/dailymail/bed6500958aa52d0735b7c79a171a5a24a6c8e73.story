It was a blunder more normally associated with politicians arriving in Downing Street.

On the eve of the World Cup, after weeks of painstaking closed training sessions, England coach Gary Neville may just have given the game away.

The former Manchester United star was photographed carrying what appeared to be coaching instructions for the England team – ahead of  their eagerly awaited opening World Cup clash against Italy on Saturday night.

Master plan? Gary Neville with notes saying 'When ball goes into central zone team must make at least three passes before hitting the CF [centre forward]' and '2 MFs [midfielders] try to get in and support for a 3v2'

The notes, which are normally confidential, hardly contained anything earth-shattering. But they might just have been handy for England’s opponents seeking any clues as to their tactics in the competition, which begins in Brazil tonight.

The faux pas comes days after an FA whiteboard was photographed inside the team’s dressing room at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami, where they played a pre-tournament friendly against Honduras.

In blue ink, under a series of tactical points, had been written: DON’T ANSWER QUESTIONS ON FALKLANDS!!!

The latest paperwork, pictured as Neville was walking out to take a training session, suggested the England team have been working hard at their beachfront base in Rio de Janeiro under manager Roy Hodgson.

The notes, scribbled in blue ballpoint pen on a team sheet, referred to the side ‘supporting midfield players’ and includes the penetrating insight that if the opposition win the ball they might ‘counter straight away’.

Opinion was split last night on whether these would be England’s tactics in the vital game – or just the sort of training ground routines used by football clubs up and down the country every week.

There was even a suggestion the notes might be a double bluff by Neville and Hodgson as the pair prepared their players for their vital first game on Saturday night. On the whiteboard photographed in Miami the words: ‘We are ready for Italy!!!!!’ were also present.

With temperatures expecting to reach 34C (93F), and 83 per cent humidity, England’s opening game is likely to be incredibly draining on the team.

Whatever the notes Neville was holding – and whatever the tactics finally employed in Manaus – the 39-year-old’s actions will keep opponents Italy guessing right up to the 11pm kick-off on how England will approach the match.
