Joe Root knows what it is like to be on the receiving end of a punch from David Warner but is confident that a repeat would never happen on a cricket field.

The latest unsavoury incident involving Australia’s wild child has heightened fears that someone soon will break cricket’s last great taboo and spark a punch-up during a high profile game, possibly even during the forthcoming World Cup.

If it does happen then there is a fair chance it will involve Warner, who found himself accused by some of racism when he clashed with Rohit Sharma during Australia’s tri-series victory over India and implored him to ‘speak English.’

It was Root who was thumped by Warner in the incident at the Walkabout Bar in Birmingham that unsettled Australia’s Ashes preparations in 2013 and revealed the Yorkshireman to be something more than a fresh-faced newcomer.

Almost two years on Root is still baby-faced with a smile that suggests butter would not melt in his mouth but opponents know him to be much more street-wise than he looks and Sri Lanka in particular hit him hard verbally last summer.

‘I can’t see it to be honest,’ said Root when asked whether we will soon see cricket’s first real bout of fisticuffs. ‘Someone will have to be in a really bad place to do that. There have been a few things that have happened over the last few months that haven’t been good for the game but I can’t see it leading to a punch-up. It’s not ice hockey.’

Maybe so but while Warner in particular is around there is always a chance something worse than the ugly scenes which marred Sunday’s match in Melbourne, which led to Warner being pulled away from Sharma, could happen.

Jonathan Agnew, the BBC cricket correspondent, tried to make the point in a piece in the Radio Times that an opportunity is in danger of being wasted if players do not clean up their act in the wake of the tragic death of Phillip Hughes.

Agnew’s comments went down badly here because, understandably, emotions on the subject of Hughes are still very raw but the point he was making is valid, particularly as Warner in particular has been quick to forget his own pledge to think twice before indulging in confrontations on the field.

Martin Crowe, the former New Zealand captain, accused Warner of being a thug and insisted that cricket needs to do more to stop the trouble-makers.

‘There is a growing concern that Warner’s thuggish behaviour has gone too far,’ wrote Crowe in an eloquent piece for ESPN Cricinfo. ’Soon one day it will lead to an incident that will sully the game for good.

‘Soon enough someone is going to get king-hit on a cricket field. And if it is him who gets hammered it will be overdue – if wrong. Fining these serial offenders is not going to work. You have to take them out of the game for extended periods. Two yellow cards should result in a red card, which would ban any player for six months.’

The idea of red and yellow cards in cricket has long been a proposal of Sportsmail’s David Lloyd but his pleadings to the International Cricket Council have so far fallen on deaf ears. Root thinks the suggestion has its merits.

‘Why not? Said Root at the suggestion of football-type cards. ‘It seems there’s a lot of people who are not happy with the way players are conducting themselves on the field so if that will sort it out then why not.’

But he feels the bulk of players are fully aware of their responsibilities. ‘When you’re out there your job is to score runs or take wickets and if your focus is elsewhere then you’re not doing your best for the team. You just instinctively know where the line is. It’s about showing respect for each other.’

Warner, who has been fined 50 per cent of his match fee, attempted to defend himself over an incident which was sparked when Australia, wrongly, felt India had run for an overthrow despite the ball deflecting off Sharma.

‘In cricket etiquette when you throw a ball to the keeper and it hits a player you don’t run,’ said Warner. ‘When I went over to him he said something in their language and I said ‘speak English’ because if you’re going to say something for me to understand I cannot speak Hindi.

‘So I did the polite thing and asked him to speak English and I thought that was okay. I got slapped on the wrist and I shouldn’t have engaged him. He told me what he had said in English and I can’t repeat it but I was in the wrong.’

More positive news came from South Africa where AB de Villiers showed what England, and others, are going to have to live up to if they are going to win the World Cup with a remarkable display of hitting against West Indies.

De Villiers reached his hundred off 31 balls, the fastest in a one-day international, and went on to 149 off 44 balls. It is an extraordinary display that frankly it is near impossible to imagine an England player emulating.

Root insists that what this young England side, who face India here at the Gabba on Tuesday in what is already a must-win game, are aiming for.

‘He is a bit of a freak, he’s a very good player, but as a side that’s what we’re aiming to do, to get those big scores, said Root. ‘Okay, it would be a serious effort to get anywhere near that but as a side that’s our aim moving forward. 

'I think we’re not far away from doing that now. We’ve put in a lot of individual performances and it’s just about putting that complete display together.’
