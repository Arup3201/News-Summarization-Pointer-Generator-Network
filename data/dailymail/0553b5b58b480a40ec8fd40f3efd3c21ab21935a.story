Enough planets exist in the Milky Way to ensure that there is at least one for each of the hundred million stars in the galaxy, NASA has revealed.

Analysis of data from the Kepler space telescope shows that 17 billion planets in the galaxy are Earth-like in size.

The findings are making scientists increasingly confident of finding a rocky planet the same size as Earth, with a similar orbit and situated in the 'habitable zone' of a solar system.

'The analysis of increasingly longer time periods of Kepler data uncovers smaller planets in longer period orbits -- orbital periods similar to Earth's," said Steve Howell, of NASA's Ames Research Center in  California.

'It is no longer a question of will we find a true Earth analogue, but a question of when.'

One of the most exciting findings is that four planets have been identified which are less than twice the size of Earth and orbit in their sun's habitable zone, the region in the planetary system where liquid water might exist on the surface of a planet.

Latest findings released by NASA show that since February last year there have been 461 potential new planets discovered.

These bring the total number of potential planets that have been identified by the Kepler mission to 2,740 and they orbit 2,036 stars.

Among the most dramatic increases is in the number of Earth-sized and super Earth-sized planets.

Discoveries of Earth-sized planets increased by 43 per cent while those of super Earths rose by 21 per cent.

Caltech planetary astronomer John Johnson said: 'We are showing that there is about one planet per star, and that gives us a total of about a hundred billion planets throughout our galaxy.

'The vast majority of those planets are orbiting stars that are very much different from our sun.'

Several of the planets being identified are in the same solar system, just as Earth is one of eight planets orbiting the Sun.

'The large number of multi-candidate systems being found by Kepler implies that a substantial fraction of exoplanets reside in flat multi-planet systems," said Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist at Ames.

'This is consistent with what we know about our own planetary neighborhood.'

The Kepler space telescope was launched by NASA in 2009 with the intention of finding Earth-like planets.

It pinpoints potential new planets by measuring the dimming of starlight as planets pass between stars and the telescope.

Not all dimming is caused by planets and it is only once dimming has been observed three times that it is formally attributed to a potential planet.

Further measurements and observations are required to confirm the identification.

In the last year the number of confirmed planets pinpointed by Kepler has risen from 33 to 105.

Cosmic dance: About 300 million light-years away, only four of these five galaxies are actually locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters

Francois Fression of the 
Harvard-Smithsonian Center presented the latest Kepler findings at a 
meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Long Beach, California, 
on Monday.

The Astrophysical Journal has accepted a paper detailing the research for publication.

Christopher Burke, a scientist at the
 SETI Institute which researches signs off extra-terrestrial 
intelligence, said that 58 planets found so far are believed to be in 
their host stars' habitable zones.

That means that any water on them has a chance of being in liquid form because the region is close enough to the star to be warm enough for ice to melt but not so close that it all evaporates.

Planets orbiting close to their suns are likely to be infernos while planets in distant orbits are likely to be icy, he said. Burke also analyzed the latest Kepler data.

The Kepler Space Telescope launched on March 7, 2009, and has been active for 3 years, 10 months and 1 day as of January 8, 2013.

The space observatory was named in honor of the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler.

Kepler is part of NASA's Discovery Program which runs relatively low-cost scientific research missions.

The observatory’s mission going forward is to find and document Earth-sized planets at greater distances.

The more planets discovered with Earth-like orbits in their habitable zones, the greater the chances of extra-terrestrial life, scientists say.
