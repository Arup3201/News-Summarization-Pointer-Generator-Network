These incredible pictures show Palestinian protesters using slingshots to hurl back tear gas cannisters fired into a village on the West Bank by Israeli security forces.

The stand-off between demonstrators and Israeli soldiers followed a solidarity march by villagers of Bilin, west of the city of Ramallah, over the construction of settlements and the confiscation of their land.

Some of the Palestinians wore masks as they threw the cannisters back at the Israelis, with noxious gases swirling in the air above their heads.

Disabled protesters joined the demonstration, with one man in a motorised wheelchair seen joining those wearing gas marks as they refused to give way to the soldiers.

Other demonstrators wore bandanas as they threw the tear gas cannisters back at the Israeli forces, who were unaffected thanks to their riot gear.

The heavily armed soldiers stood their ground at the top of a gravel road while the protesters waited down on the outskirts of the village, shouting and gesturing while holding their slingshots.

Israeli security forces also used a foul-smelling weapon, known as 'skunk' to clear activists as they drove trucks through the village. The smell is said to resemble rotting sewage and can take up to five years to clear.

Weekly protests have been held in the village since 2005 over Israeli plans to seize residents' land and build new Jewish settlements.

In 2009, Palestinian protester Bassem Abu Rahmeh was killed at the protests after a tear gas cannister fired by the Israelis struck him in the chest.

Jawaher Abu Rahmah, 36, died on New Year's Eve in 2010 after she was seriously injured in a tear gas attack, however some reports say she was not present at that day's protest.

The fourth anniversary of her death could heighten tensions in the area over the next few weeks, with the protests set to continue.
