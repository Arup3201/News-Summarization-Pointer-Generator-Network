Germany has a new hero. The national team may be preparing for their second round clash with Algeria on Monday evening, but back home, the name on everyone’s lips is neither Thomas Mueller, nor Miroslav Klose, nor Phillipp Lahm. The name on everyone’s lips is Howard Webb.

The Premier League referee is England’s last surviving representative at this summer’s World Cup.

He gained worldwide praise for his outstanding display during Brazil’s victory over Chile on Saturday.  Nowhere has the praise been louder than in Germany.

Decisive: Former World Cup final referee Webb spotted Hulk handling the ball and booked him

Outrage: Hulk complains to assistant referee Michael Mullarkey but the English officials got it right

On Monday morning, the German papers were packed full of plaudits for Webb. The 'Tagesspiegel' referred to the former police sergeant as 'The best Englishman', while the 'Berliner Morgenpost' described his performance as 'a shining example to other referees'.

'Bild' went one further, claiming that Webb was a 'chink of light' in the never-ending discussions over poor refereeing decisions.

'Webb is the World Cup’s Super-Referee!' wrote Germany’s biggest newspaper, 'can he not take charge of every single game?'

The Munich paper 'Sueddeutsche Zeitung' also pointed out the stark contrast between Webb’s performance and those of his contemporaries.

'The English referee is reparing the reputation of his profession. He is correcting the impression of otherwise overwhelmingly average refereeing displays' they told their readers.

In all corners, there was praise for Webb’s correct assessment of a number of difficult decisions, not least the penalty he denied Brazil striker Hulk, having correctly judged that the player had controlled the ball with his upper arm. 

Webb’s general approach to the game was also remarked upon, with most pointing out that he was reluctant to issue cards, and thereby allowed the game to flow freely. 

To earn so much respect from the German media was no mean feat for the British referee. Prior to this tournament, his name was a byword in Germany for poor officiating, courtesy of his infamous poor decision at the World Cup Final in 2010.

On that day, he failed to send off Dutch midfielder Nigel de Jong, despite the player having planted his studs into the chest of Spain’s Xabi Alonso.

Good call: Although on first viewing the goal looked legitimate, Webb rightly spotted Hulk's handball

Ridiculed: Webb was mocked by the German press for only giving a yellow card for this 'tackle' by Nigel de Jong

Now though, Webb’s reputation is restored in Germany. He has 'rehabilitated' himself, as the Sueddeutsche Zeitung put it. Indeed, many are now calling for him to be in charge of this year’s final.

'Webb was cool-headed and courageous,' wrote the Spiegel, 'as a performance, it was the perfect application to referee a second consecutive World Cup Final'.

Germany will also be hoping that Webb’s comeback can inspire a similar reaction from their own whistle carrying representative.

Rehabilitation: The former policeman's excellent display on Saturday has revived his reputation

The German referee at this tournament is Felix Brych, who achieved infamy last season after granting Bayer Leverkusen a goal, despite the ball having clearly hit the side netting.

His nomination for the World Cup was greeted with much derision in the German media.

Brych was Webb’s fourth official on Saturday. Perhaps, in the dressing room, he picked up some tips on how to go from laughing stock to refereeing superstar.
