A teenager from north London has been charged with robbery after an alleged attempted raid at a jewellers yards from Buckingham Palace was foiled by a member of the Royal Household.

Kaneen Gopaul, 18, from Islington, will appear before Wimbledon Magistrates Court today accused of robbery and handling stolen goods.

The charges came a day after a gang of alleged would-be thieves pulled up on a motorbike and scooter outside H Stain jewellers in Victoria armed with axes and sledgehammers and tried to smash the glass windows.

A passer-by, believed to be a member of the Royal Household working at Buckingham Palace, grabbed a man by his hoodie, bundled him to the ground and kept him restrained until police arrived, while the rest of the bungling raiders rode off.

Caught: Four men allegedly attempted to break into H Stain jewellers - one suspect was held down by a passer-by

Pinned down: The four men were said to have been wielding axes. One can be seen in this image

The passer-by, who did not want to be named, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It was like watching a scene from a Guy Ritchie movie.’

He
 added: ‘When they tried to zoom off I grabbed one by 
the hoodie. Not putting his hoodie up was a fatal mistake as it gave me 
something to get hold of.

‘He
 swore at me and I managed to yank him off his machine. I thought: "This 
is my bloody city - why should thugs like this get away with it?" I hope 
the police manage to get them.’

A witness who spoke to an officer at the scene said one of the men who detained the rider had identified himself to police as a member of the Royal Household.  Buckingham Palace said they would not comment on the incident.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said that it was believed the robbers had fled empty-handed.

Foiled: Police said they arrested a man at the scene and are now looking for the three others

Scene: The gang arrived at H Stain jeweller on Victoria Street in central London armed with hammers and axes

Scene: As they tried to flee, a member of the public grabbed one of them, bundled him to the ground and kept him restrained. A motorbike was left outside the store (left), where the windows were smashed (right)

Got nothing: A Scotland Yard spokesman said that it was believed the robbers had fled empty-handed

Small business: The family-owned jewellers is a 10-minute walk from Buckingham Palace in Victoria

Police are now hunting the three men, all of whom are believed to have made their getaway by hailing black cabs, and are appealing to the cabbies who picked them up to get in touch.

One pillion passenger is said to have fled down Lower Grosvenor Road and picked up a taxi outside the Robin Hotel, near the junction with Buckingham Palace Road.

The motorbike rider and his pillion passenger fled on a green Triumph motorbike but abandoned it in Eaton Square and thought to have hailed a black cab near Eccleston Mews and escaped.

The Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'We believe the suspects who hailed the black cabs would have done so not long after 1pm and officers are particularly keen to hear from the taxi drivers who made these pick ups.'

H Stain - a family-owned jewellers which was established in 1914 - is located outside London Victoria train station, a 10-minute walk from Buckingham Palace.
