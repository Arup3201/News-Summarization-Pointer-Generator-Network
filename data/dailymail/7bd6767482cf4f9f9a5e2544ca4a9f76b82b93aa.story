Ali Carter has been given the all clear from cancer for the second time in two years.

The snooker player announced the news on Twitter on Friday evening, saying: 'Two beautiful words that I've been waiting for!! "ALL CLEAR" I can now concentrate on getting my life and career back! #beatingcancer'

Carter, who was last year treated for testicular cancer and has battled Crohn's disease for over a decade, revealed he would undergo a course of chemotherapy in May after being diagnosed with lung cancer.

The 35-year-old, twice a runner-up at the Crucible, returned to action in October at the General Cup in Hong Kong and ended the tournament as the champion after beating Shaun Murphy in the final.

He had put off his return to snooker by pulling out of a Players Tour Championship event in Sofia, Bulgaria, following a final round of chemotherapy.

There was disappointment for Carter at the recent UK Championship, though, when he was beaten in the first round by Zhang Anda.
