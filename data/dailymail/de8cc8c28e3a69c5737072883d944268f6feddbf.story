Microsoft says its new Windows 10 operating system will be coming 'this summer' in 190 countries and 111 languages.

In a blog post late Tuesday, Microsoft executive vice president Terry Myerson said the operating system designed for multiple devices would also have a 'small footprint' for connected devices.

'We continue to make great development progress and shared today that Windows 10 will be available this summer in 190 countries and 111 languages,' he said.

Microsoft is yet to provide a precise date for the launch of the Windows 10 operating system, which is aimed at powering PCs,smartphones and also connected devices such as bank machines and medical equipment.

New operating system will run on the 'broadest types of devices ever'.

Microsoft has yet to provide a precise date for the launch of the operating system, which is aimed at powering PCs,smartphones and also connected devices such as bank machines and medical equipment.

'For the first time, a new version of Windows for small footprint IoT (Internet of Things)  devices will be available -- for free -- when Windows 10 launches,' Myerson said.

'Windows 10 will offer versions of Windows for a diverse set of IoT devices, ranging from powerful devices like ATMs and ultrasound machines, to resource constrained devices like gateways.'

Microsoft is also working with fast-growing Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi to test Windows 10 on its devices.

The US tech giant also announced partnerships with Chinese-based Tencent and Lenovo to help customers in China upgrade to Windows 10.

The company also said Tuesday that Windows 10 will allow users to sign in to a device without a password by using biometrics, including facial recognition.

It is also making its biggest push into the heavily pirated Chinese consumer computing market this summer by offering free upgrades to Windows 10 to all Windows users, regardless of whether they are running genuine copies of the software.

The move is an unprecedented attempt by Microsoft to get legitimate versions of its software onto machines of the hundreds of millions of Windows users in China. 

Recent studies show that three-quarters of all PC software is not properly licensed there.

Windows 10 will include a new Xbox app to allow users to easily share with friends, and is extremely similar to the firm's Xbox One console system.

Terry Myerson, who runs Microsoft's operating systems unit, announced the plan at the WinHEC technology conference in Shenzhen, China.

'We are upgrading all qualified PCs, genuine and non-genuine, to Windows 10,' he said in a telephone interview with Reuters. The plan is to 're-engage' with the hundreds of millions of users of Windows in China, he said, without elaboration. 

Microsoft said in January it would offer free upgrades to Windows 10 for users of Windows 7 or later in an attempt to hold onto users and make up for lost revenue by selling services such as Office over the Internet.

Microsoft is working with Lenovo Group Ltd, the world's biggest PC maker, to help roll out Windows 10 in China to current Windows users, Myerson said.

It also is offering Windows 10 through security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co and Tencent Holdings Ltd, China's biggest social networking company, which will build a Windows 10 app that will work on smartphones and PCs for its popular QQ gaming and messaging service. QQ has more than 800 million users.

Lenovo said in a statement that it will make phones running Windows software, available through China Mobile, sometime later this year.

Microsoft also said it is working with Chinese handset maker Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd - which generally uses a form of Google Inc's Android on its devices - to offer some customers a test version of Windows 10 on their smartphones.'
