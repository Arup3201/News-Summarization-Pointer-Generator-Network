Killed: Ross Simons, 34, and his wife Clare, 30, (pictured) died in January 2013 when their tandem bicycle was struck by driver Nicholas Lovell

A move to introduce life sentences for killer drivers has been welcomed by families of victims.

The new measure is one of several changes being drawn up by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in a bid to toughen up the criminal justice system.

The maximum sentence for motorists is currently 14 years and the plan to increase this limit is being welcomed by relatives of a couple run down in Bristol by a speeding driver who was already banned from the roads.

Ross Simons, 34, and his wife Clare, 30, died in January 2013 when their tandem bicycle was struck by Nicholas Lovell, who had 69 driving convictions and was fleeing police at the time.

Heroin addict Lovell, 38, left the couple dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away 'with four years'. 

He was eventually sentenced to ten and a half years for each death but was ordered to serve the punishments concurrently, meaning he would effectively only serve one sentence for both deaths.

Since his trial, the Simons's families have been campaigning for tougher sentences for dangerous drivers.

Speaking to The Express, Mr Simons's sister Kelly Woodruff, 33, said: 'Finally as a family we will be able to rest and be a bit more at peace when they make this change to the law.

'The purpose of our campaign has always been to try to ensure no other family has to go through what we have suffered. 

'I hope this will not only help save lives by acting as a deterrent but when the worst does happen it will at least give families a sense that justice has been done, something we have never felt.'

Call for tougher laws: Heroin addict Lovell, 38, left the couple dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away 'with four years'

The Simons, described by friends as lovely and caring, were said to be trying for a baby and had 'everything to live for'.

In the run up to the collision a police officer in a patrol car recognised Lovell behind the wheel and knew he was banned.

Lovell failed to stop when the officer switched on his blue light, disappearing from view, before ploughing into the Simons as they rode their tandem bike.

Last week Justice Secretary Chris Grayling visited the site where the couple were killed, along with the MP for Kingswood Bristol, Chris Skidmore, who has long backed the campaign.

Reviewing law: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants to toughen up the criminal justice system

Speaking to the Bristol Post, Mr Grayling said: 'I don't like the idea of people like this coming out half way through the sentence.

'It is shocking to walk here in a normal suburban street and see what can happen. I can only imagine the trauma and turmoil the family must have been through.'

Mr Skidmore added: 'We have fought the campaign to get laws changed, which could already prevent future deaths but we want to go further.' 

The plan to increase the maximum penalty from 14 years is one of several new measures being considered by Mr Grayling to toughen up the criminal justice system.

Drivers who flee the scene of an accident without stopping and motorists using their phones at the wheel will also be targeted with harsher punishments.

Mr Grayling claims both he and the Prime Minister have agreed to review the upper sentencing limit for causing death by dangerous driving.

The Justice Secretary says those caught using mobile phones behind the wheel have 'no excuse' with the hands-free sets available to drivers today.

Mr Grayling is also looking to introduce new offences to deal with jihadists attempting to return to the UK and says there are also plans for stricter controls on internet trolls.
