The 71-year-old wife of an Ohio judge has been arrested and is facing attempted murder charges after poisoning her spouse with antifreeze.

Carla Hague, who has been married to Ashtabula County Common Pleas Juvenile-Probate Judge Charles Hague for 45 years, was officially charged Monday with felonious assault, three months after the judge was hospitalized.

Her arrest came one day after her birthday.

On September 15, Charles Hague was rushed to the Cleveland Clinic after he turned gravely ill.

Carla Hague was arrested on Monday Dec. 2, one day after her 71st birthday, following an alleged plot to kill her husband with antifreeze at their home in Ohio

Ashtabula County Judge Charles Hague was rushed to hospital on September 15, with tests showing he had high levels of the primary ingredient in antifreeze in his system

Blood tests revealed he had high levels of ethylene glycol in his system, which is the primary compound in antifreeze, a chemical added to a car radiator to stop it from turning to ice.

Judge Hague was been on medical leave since.

Family members filed a complaint with the Ashtabula County Sheriff's Department a few days later.

Carla Hague, a retired nurse, is now facing attempted murder, according to Sheriff William R. Johnson.

She is being held in jail in nearby Lake County.

With details scant, Sheriff Johnson said the investigation is not over.

'Certainly we knew from the very beginning it's was a high-profile case because it's a sitting judge,' he said.

Ashtabula is a remote town in Ohio with a population of less than 18,000 people

'When we do investigation, it makes no difference. We do it the same way.'

A court has not yet been set and Hague has not listed an attorney.

Dodie Mattson, who campaigned for Charles Hague when he ran for election, said she was shocked by the allegations.

'They're wonderful people,' she told the Ashtabula Star Beacon.

'I can't believe it.'

The poisoning allegations came two and a half weeks after a Cleveland woman was sentenced to life in prison for killing her fiance by putting Antifreeze in his iced tea.

Ashtabula County, with about 20,000 people, is located along the Interstate 90 corridor between Cleveland and Erie, Pa.

Antifreeze is a toxic chemical additive used in the radiators of cars to prevent the water from turning to ice during the winter
