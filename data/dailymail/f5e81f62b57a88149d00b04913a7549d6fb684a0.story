Maria Sharapova posed with the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen at the Eiffel Tower on Sunday as she celebrated her French Open win.

The Russian had to battle for three hours and two minutes to end the challenge of Simona Halep and clinch her fifth Grand Slam title.

From feeling like clay was an alien surface, Sharapova has turned it into her most successful stage.

Out in force: Fans were out and about on Sunday morning to see the champion celebrate her victory

This was her third successive final at Roland Garros having won the title for the first time in 2012 and lost to Serena Williams 12 months ago, and this is the first time she has won the same trophy more than once at any slam.

Sharapova said: ‘If somebody had told me that at some stage in my career I’d have more Roland Garros titles than any other grand slam I’d probably go get drunk, or tell them to get drunk.

‘It’s really amazing. I feel that I worked to get to this position. There is no substitute in these titles. You can’t just go out there and do it without putting in the effort.

‘You’re not just born being a natural clay-court player. Okay, maybe if you’re Nadal. But certainly not me. I didn’t grow up on it, didn’t play on it. I just took it upon myself to make myself better on it.’

Winner: The Russian defeated Simona Halep in the final in three sets

The 27-year-old played only one match after Wimbledon last year because of a shoulder injury and struggled to rediscover her best form during the first three months of this season.

She said: ‘It’s the most emotional victory for me. The toughest one physically that I’ve come across in a final, especially a grand slam. There are not too many finals that you go past three hours.

‘To look back seven or eight years and to think that I would be in that position, I would come through against an opponent that makes you play and hit and run and hits so many shots and recover in conditions that start from cold to being warm.

‘So much adversity is thrown at you, and I’m just proud I came through and I adjusted in all different situations and I end up with this (trophy).’

Double: It was her second win in Paris, after first lifting the title in 2012
