OJ Simpson is not only pining for his freedom, he also longs for the days when he was described as a handsome hunk and not a flabby failure. And he's finally doing something about it.

According to a close family friend, the 66-year-old disgraced gridiron great is desperately trying to lose weight, tired of reading published reports that he is old and fat since he appeared at a bail hearing last summer in an effort to have his 2008 armed-robberty conviction overturned.

'OJ has been upset. Everybody keeps talking about how he's gained so much weight and that he looks awful!' the friend explained.

Cookie monster: Since he appeared at a parole hearing last year, OJ Simpson has packed on the pounds.Tired of people mocking of his considerable girth, he's passing on the sweets to try to get back into shape

Back in the day: OJ cut a handsome figure in the mid-'80's. The top notch athlete had everything going for him until the night wife Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered on June 12, 1994

He was described as bloated, overweight and struggling to walk with his bad knees. He was tipping the scale at 300 pounds.

When the the hearing was over,  OJ was transported from the Las Vegas jail back to his cell in the Lovelock, Nevada Correctional Center where he began reading reports about his case. But after briefly mentioning what happened in court, everyone seemed to focus on his appearance calling him an ugly old fat man who could barely walk.

'OJ was really p***** off because he's used to being called the hunk, handsome or a lady's man so he decided to start getting more exercise and eating less carbs and junk food,' the friend continued.

'At one time OJ was dubbed the 'cookie monster' at Locklock because he would grab as many cookies as he could in the chow hall and he would also try to sneak cookies back to his cell.

'One time he got caught by the guards and they embarrassed him in front of the other inmates. He also loves ice cream sandwiches and would eat three or four at a time.

'OJ would rather eat junk food than what they had for lunch or dinner in the chow hall.'

Inmates typically eat hot or cold cereal like oatmeal or Cheerios for breakfast. For lunch they typically get cold sandwiches of bologna or peanut butter with carrots or some oher veggies on the side and there is a rotation burgers, hot dogs and some sort of pasta for dinner.

'The food is terrible but it's better for you than chips and ice cream.

OJ through thick and thin: The gridiron star was almost gaunt when he was arrested for wife Nicole's murder in 1994. By 2001, he was living large in Miami. His face was puffy, but he still looked robust

By the time he was convicted of burglary, robbery and kidnapping in 2008, OJ was looking tired an paunchy. But it was at his parole hearing last year that his cookie-and-ice-cream diet took it's true toll in pounds

'OJ is being careful not to eat the pasta
 but he will eat the burgers without the bread. He can also buy canned 
vegetables or canned tuna from the commissary and he's doing more of that instead of chips and cookies.

He says its not so much that he likes the junk food but rather the horrible food the prison is giving the inmates is the reason he eats chips instead of the green hot dogs.

'I gained weight eating all those canned beans from the commissary but just because I can't get enough fruits and vegetables,' Simpson reportedly said about his weight gain. "My family's been bugging me to stop with the beans.'

'The truth is OJ has a sweet tooth and loves to eat ice cream outside while he's coaching the baseball team,' the family friend explained, 'and he walked around the prison yard when the weather is nice but if it's cold or raining his sits in his cell watching TV eating junk from the commissary.

But now he started walking more frequently ant curbing the treats and he's dropped about 30 pounds, says the friend.

'OJ can't run because his knees are really banged up from years of playing football so he walks around the perimeter of the prison yard for as long as he can before his knees start to ache.

'Sometimes he can walk for about an hour and sometimes it's just 30 minutes and he's not eating as much junk anymore. OJ gets exhausted, he's out there huffing and puffing but when his knees start to hurt he can't do it anymore.

'OJ says sometimes it feels like sharp needles are going through his legs and it's so painful he care barely get back to his cell to lie down.'

Home cookin': OJ resides at Locklock, Nevada Correctional Center now, where a friend says he is getting more exercise and eating less carbs and junk. 'The food is terrible'

OJ had gained weight eating pasta, cookies, Hostess cakes and ice cream from the commissary and he could get as much as he wanted because women are still sending money to put on his books while still collecting money from his NFL pension, explains the firend.

'OJ is also in the 'pill line' everyday because he has to take meds for his high blood pressure. He's hoping once he gets his weight down his blood pressure will be back to normal.

'He has a lot of health problems but he didn't think about trying to get them under control until everyone started calling him a fat pig. And he was afraid the ladies would stop writing and sending pictures of themselves to him.

'OJ's priorities are still backwards.

'OJ cares more about what women think of him instead of what his children think of him and what he plans to do if he's released on parole in 2017.

The friend says is growing a goatee, it's completely white hair, but he's trying a different look hoping to distance himself from the 'old OJ' like that is going to help his image.

In 2008, OJ was convicted on charges of burglary, robbery, kidnapping and assault while in possession of a deadly weapon related to a 2007 robbery of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas hotel.  OJ testified he was trying to retrieve those items because they belonged him but the jury rejected that explanation and he was sentenced to up to 33 years in prison.

OJ is appealing his case to the Nevada Supreme Court but he's more hopeful he will be released when he is up for his next parole hearing in 2017.
