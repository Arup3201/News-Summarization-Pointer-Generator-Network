Salmonella, insects, excrement and hair found in imported spices, from countries such as India and Vietnam, have caused outbreaks around the world, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.

Some 12 per cent of imported spices contained what the FDA deemed as ‘filth’ - insects, excrement and hair – between 2007 and 2010, the new report said.

The imported spices were also twice as likely to contain salmonella as any other inspected foods with almost 7 per cent of the goods containing the pathogen during the three-year period.

Buyer beware: Salmonella, insects, excrement and hair has been found in imported spices from countries such as Vietnam and India, the US Food and Drug Administration claimed in a new report

Over three years, 749 spice shipments were refused entry into the US because of salmonella contamination while another 238 were sent back because they contained hair, excrement, insects or other contaminants.

The FDA, which monitors food and drug safety for US consumers, decided to investigate imported spices after several spice-related illness outbreaks occurred around the world.

Black and red pepper in salami from China, Vietnam and India caused hundreds of illnesses and some 14 known outbreaks effected more than 2,000 people, many children, since 1973 according to the FDA. The outbreaks caused 1,946 reported illnesses, 128 hospitalisations and two deaths.

During the production process, harvest 
and immediate storage were considered the stages when spices were most 
at risk of contamination.

All by hand: The FDA said many of the imported spices came from very small farms where animals are used to plough crops, produce is harvested by hand and spices dried in the open air

Some contaminated spices were allowed through customs because they were later cooked or treated, killing the salmonella. The FDA said that by the time the spices were eaten most of the pathogen was likely to be gone.

The report also noted that the amount of
spices that an individual consumer would normally eat was so small that
most had less chance of getting sick from contaminated spices than from
contaminated fruit or vegetables.

A FDA statement said: 'People’s tendency to eat small amounts of spices with meals generally lowers the probability of illness from contaminated spices relative to similarly contaminated foods consumed in larger amounts.

'It is also possible that illnesses caused by contaminated spices are under reported, particularly because of challenges related to attribution for minor ingredients in multi-ingredient foods.'

According to Fox News, Michael Taylor, the deputy commissioner for foods at the FDA, said the agency was ‘not recommending that consumers stay away from spices’. He did, however, advise that when cooking, spices should be added before cooking to reduce the risk of getting sick.

The FDA report said that farms and agricultural centres of varying size are used to produce spices around the world. Many are produced on very small farms where animals are used to plough crops. They are often harvested by hand and spices are dried in the open air.
