An Italian nurse who took photographs of herself with dead patients murdered 'for pleasure' and enjoyed 'the challenge', it has been claimed. 

Daniela Poggiali, 41, was arrested by officers in Lugo, northern Italy, after the unexpected death of a 78-year-old patient who was admitted with a routine illness.

The inquiry was widened to include 38 deaths, ten of which have been described as 'very suspicious'.

Police are investigating whether hospital nurse Daniela Poggiali (pictured) could have killed up to 38 patients in Lugo, northern Italy. Prosecutors said ten cases were 'very suspicious' - but would be hard to prove

Ms Poggiali allegedly targeted patients she thought were annoying or who were visited by 'pushy relatives.' 

'We believe she is sound of mind, but simply took satisfaction, and real pleasure in killing', Alessandro Mancini, the magistrate leading the inquiry told The Times.

Police started the investigation following the death of Rosa Calderoni, 78, in April, who was recovering from a broken femur and was admitted to the hospital feeling dizzy. 

Investigators say that during a post-mortem examination doctors found high traces of potassium chloride, which vanishes after 48 hours, making it hard to detect. 

It was also found in a drip investigators believe the nurse was using.  

Potassium can stop the heart and is one of the components used in the lethal injection given to death row inmates in the US. 

The morning that Mrs Calderoni died was Ms Poggiali's first day shift after she had been switched from nights by doctors increasingly worried about the number of deaths on her watch.

Mr Mancini said: 'I believe she saw this change in shifts as a challenge and wanted to show she could kill by day as well.' 

She put pressure on one nurse to take photos of her standing over a patient who had just died. 'She appears euphoric in the photo, next to someone she may have just killed,' said Mr Mancini.

Posting the photo online, Poggiali captioned it: 'Mm... Life and Death.'

'The photos reveal an unbearable cruelty that I have not seen in 30 years on the job,' said Mr Mancini.

Poggiali reportedly gave sedatives to troublesome patients to avoid being disturbed, telling colleagues: 'Don't worry, I will take care of them.'

'The sedatives were possibly a warm-up to her killing spree,' said Mr Mancini. 

In local reports, one nurse who worked with Ms Poggiali described her as a 'cold person but always eager to work'.

Another nurse said she was worried when a relative of the director of nursing at the hospital - a manager disliked by Poggiali - was admitted.

'I had a premonition,' the nurse said. One hour later, he was dead. 'I turned to stone and said to myself, 'Here we go again' .'

One claimed Ms Poggiali, who lives with her boyfriend, had once given powerful laxatives to patients towards the end of her shift to 'embarrass' colleagues working on the shift after her.

Police say that she had been stealing money from patients. 'When one patient protested, Poggiali replied: 'You've got five euros left and you won't need it.' That patient died a week later,' Mr Mancini said.
