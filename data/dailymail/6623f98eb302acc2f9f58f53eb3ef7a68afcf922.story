More than 20,000 patients waited at least two months for vital cancer treatment last year, figures show. This is up by a quarter on the previous year, raising fears delays are hindering survival chances.

Rules state that 85 per cent of patients should wait no longer than 62 days for surgery, chemotherapy or other drugs after being referred by their GP with suspected cancer. 

But figures covering the quarterly period from October to December show only 83.8 per cent were treated.

Charities say this is a ‘fundamental failure’ of the NHS and warn that thousands of patients are being let down, possibly suffering tragic consequences.

Within the figures are some patients who have had to wait more than four months for vital surgery, over which time tumours can spread to other organs and be untreatable.

There is also concern that Britain’s cancer survival rates will begin to ‘slide backwards’ having so greatly improved in recent decades.

Dr Fran Woodard, Director of Policy and Research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is deeply concerning that the cancer waiting time targets, which outline the time it should take for people with cancer to begin treatment following an urgent GP referral, have been breached once again in England.

‘This marks a year of this target being consistently missed, a year in which we’ ve barely seen any improvements to waiting times being made.

‘This shows a fundamental failure within the NHS.’

Sarah Woolnough, Cancer Research UK’s executive director of policy and information, said: ‘This isn’t just about missed targets – consecutive breaches mean thousands of patients are being failed.

‘These targets exist to ensure swift diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment, which is vital if we’re serious about having the best survival rates in the world.

‘The breaches of this target must end, which is why urgent action must be taken to support the NHS.’

Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said: ‘In the last year, thousands of cancer patients have waited too long for treatment to start and, in some cases, their chances of survival have been harmed.

‘Ministers have left families facing anxious waits for cancer tests and treatment and their complacency is dangerous. When it comes to cancer, speed is everything.'

NHS officials say the delays are occurring because hospitals are having to treat rising numbers of patients diagnosed with cancer, mainly due to the aging population.

Sean Duffy, NHS England’s National Clinical Director for Cancer, said: ‘Swift diagnosis of cancer is key.

‘But it’s crucial we focus on maintaining waiting time standards for treatment as demand increases so we are closely scrutinising these figures to pinpoint any issues on the ground.’ 

The number of women being screened for breast cancer has fallen for the third year in a row, raising fears of a loss of confidence after controversy over the benefits.

NHS figures show 30,000 fewer women aged between 53 and 70 were screened for the disease in the three years prior to March last year than in the previous period.

A major review into the screening programme in 2012 concluded it saves 1,300 lives a year, but leads to 4,000 women having treatment they never needed.
