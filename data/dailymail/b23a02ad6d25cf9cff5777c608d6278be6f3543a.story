Irish trainer Philip Fenton had one kilo of anabolic steroids in his stables when veterinary inspectors carried out a raid, a court has been told.

The Cheltenham Festival-winning trainer is facing eight charges over substances allegedly found at his Co Tipperary base in January 2012.

The substances include a quantity of steroid Nitrotain and a 20ml bottle of a second performance enhancing drug, Ilium Stanabolic.

Fenton’s trial will take place at Carrick-on-Suir District Court on October 23.

The prosecution is being brought in the name of Ireland's Minister for Agriculture for infringements of rules on animal remedies.

Both the BHA and the Irish Turf Club are monitoring the case.

In March, the BHA allowed Fenton, 49, who attended yesterday’s hearing but did not make any comment, to run Dunguib and Last Instalment at the Cheltenham Festival but only after carrying out screening tests on both horses.

Meanwhile, in-form trainer Hugo Palmer, who landed his first group race with Aktabantay in Saturday’s Solario Stakes at Sandown, will consider supplementing yesterday’s Salisbury scorer New Providence, to the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket on September 27.

John Warren, the Queen’s racing adviser, has confirmed Estimate will run in next Friday’s Doncaster Cup.
