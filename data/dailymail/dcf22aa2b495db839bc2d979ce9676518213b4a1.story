Demonstrators in New York who have been protesting the grand jury decision in Ferguson this week are plotting a revolt against the Thanksgiving Day Parade to 'make people stop and listen' and 'make history'.

The hashtag #StopTheParade set social media on fire on Wednesday night, after thousands took over the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn on Tuesday after police officer Darren Wilson escaped charges over the shooting death of Michael Brown.

The New York Post is reporting that those protests - in which 10 of an estimated 3,000 were arrested - have inspired a bigger plan to use the spotlight surrounding the parade to push what they say is injustice.

A notice posted to Facebook read: 'We do not accept state violence or genocide as cause for celebration. When the masses gather for the Thanksgiving Day Parade, we will gather to remind the public that BLACK LIVES MATTER.

'We will meet on the steps of the Public Library bright and early to plan exact flash mob location and make our signs. Please bring cardboard/posterboard small enough to hide on your person and markers.'

Drumming up support: This post was circulating Facebook Wednesday night, urging people to join a flash mob that will hit the the 88th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

Time and place: The group are set to meet at the New York Public Library at 7am to plan the protest, so as not to telegraph their plans online

 #StopTheParade: Twitter was alight with people supporting the push against the Thanksgiving Day Parade

Plan: A map of the parade and of a plan of how to disrupt it was being spread on Twitter

'With this hands-off approach (by police), it gives (protesters) free rein to do anything they want,' a law enforcement source told The Post.

'It’s a free pass to act like a fool.'

However a central part of the parade each year is a significant police presence.

While Tuesday night's protests were spontaneous, catching police off guard, the same cannot be said for the parade, which brings the city to a halt.

'They’re not going to be able to do at the parade what they did at the Brooklyn Bridge,' the source added to the post.

'What are they going to do, trample kids to stop a float?'

The Facebook post that was circulating Wednesday maintained that demonstrators do not want to disrupt the parade.

'We are not interrupting the march, we are making a statement in the crowds,' the post said.

'However, this is a HIGHLY POLICED event. 

'NYPD acts as parade security, so be aware, and understand we are not posting all details to the web.' 

Will the weather get better? New York City experienced rain and snow Wednesday - just one day before the 88th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

Getting ready: A worker is seen inflating a Papa Smurf balloon on Wednesday 

Secret magic: Helium is the stuff that makes Snoopy, Spider-Man, Papa Smurf and other huge balloons sail high above the crowd at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York

 A protest is not the only obstacle the parade - now in its 88th year - is going to have to overcome in order to run smoothly today. 

New York City experienced both rain and snow Wednesday, leaving the city wet and cold for the thousands of spectators set to turn out to watch.

Fortunately Thursday is expected to see dry weather with some clouds, the Weather Channel reported.

 The likes of Papa Smurf, Spider-Man and Spongebob were photographed being inflated by workers on Wednesday.

Both onlookers and workers were snapped bundled up near the balloons as rain poured down. 

Almost showtime: A Spongebob Squarepants balloon is seen in Manhattan on Wednesday. The amount of helium needed for the parade balloons has to be enough to fill 600,000 to 700,000 Mylar party balloons

Inclement weather: Both onlookers and workers were snapped bundled up near the balloons on Wednesday, with rain pouring down

On the scene: Balloon crewman Kevin Jackson gets out Wednesday from under some of the balloons that are part of the 15,000 Macy's balloons for the parade and will transport them to New York

Helping hand: Workers helped out with the balloons despite the bad weather 

It'll never rank up there with turkey and pumpkin pie, but for millions of Americans the Thanksgiving experience just wouldn't be the same without.. helium.

For 364 days of the year, the colorless and odorless gas works quietly behind the scenes, doing jobs like chilling magnets in MRI imaging machines and helping welders protect their work from impurities.

But on Thanksgiving, the lighter-than-air element moves onto a much bigger stage. It's the stuff that makes Snoopy, Spider-Man, Papa Smurf and other huge balloons sail high above the crowd at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York.

Just so we can be properly thankful for the second most abundant element in the universe (it ranks behind hydrogen), AP turned for some basic facts to Eric Bass. He is product manager for helium at Linde North America Inc. This week, for the 20th straight year, his company will supply the gas to the parade, which in turn is marking its 88th year.

Helium forms underground and tends to mingle with natural gas deposits. So when companies extract and process the natural gas, they separate out the helium and sell it to companies like Linde. Helium is shipped worldwide, so the stuff that will pump up Paddington Bear or Pikachu could come from as close as Kansas or Wyoming, or as far away as Qatar, Africa or even Australia.

The gas is first chilled for it gets to the parade, so it can be made into a liquid and it's easier to transport. Huge, specialized containers of the stuff are shipped to a plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Gas floats above the liquid in these containers; this gas is drawn off and compressed. The gas is loaded into heavy steel tubes, and 10 to 12 tubes are put on each of four flatbed trucks. The day before the parade, the trucks drive into Manhattan for the inflating of the parade balloons. Crews fill the balloons with long hoses, topping them off on parade day.

The amount of helium needed for the parade has to be enough to fill 600,000 to 700,000 Mylar party balloons. But the parade helium is 99.999 percent pure, whereas the stuff in a party balloon might be only 97.5 percent pure.

Heroic effort: Spider-Man was seen getting prepared for the parade with puddles on the street next to him

Blasting through: A balloon depicting Thomas the Tank Engine was also being prepared, as workers donned yellow rain gear 

The balloons, meanwhile, come in a variety of sizes. According to Macy's, Snoopy is as tall as a three-story building, as long as 11 bicycles and as wide as five taxi cabs. The big balloons are made up of multiple chambers that are inflated individually.

After the parade, the helium escapes to the atmosphere as the balloons are deflated. In 2008, Linde tried recycling some of the gas by withdrawing it through tubes put into some of the balloons. But Bass said the process was expensive, and there wasn't enough time to recover most of the gas before the streets had to be cleared for traffic.

Multiple celebrities are set to appear at the parade, a handful of which include Hilary Duff, Romeo Santos, Nick Jonas, Lucy Hale, Idinia Menzel, Meghan Trainor, John LeClair, Pat LaFontaine, and Quvenzhané Wallis, and even the Taney Dragons according to NBC.

Musical numbers from several Broadway productions, including 'Honeymoon in Vegas' and 'On the Town' are also expected.

Global effort: Helium is shipped worldwide, so the stuff that will pump up Paddington Bear or Pikachu could come from as close as Kansas or Wyoming, or as far away as Qatar, Africa or even Australia

Essential: It'll never rank up there with turkey and pumpkin pie, but for millions of Americans the Thanksgiving experience just wouldn't be the same without..helium for the parade balloons
