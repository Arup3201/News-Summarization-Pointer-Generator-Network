If rollerskates are too retro and skateboarding too restrictive, there’s a new hydrid vehicle to master.

The Post Modern Skateboard is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates, and allows riders to perform effortless-looking spins... with a lot of practice.

It comprises two 10-inch wheels, which riders position their feet inside, instead of balancing on a conventional board.

The Post Modern Skateboard (pictured) is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates, and allows riders to perform effortless-looking spins... with a lot of practice.

The wheels can be joined together with a pole, to make the experience more like skateboarding, or kept separate, to be used more like in-line skates.

‘The annular skates… are propelled by leaning side to side, allowing you to skateboard without having to push off the ground,’ according to the entry in the Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue.

‘Riders simply place their feet on the two platforms and lean side-to-side to rotate the rubber wheels around the feet, propelling riders forward in a serpentine motion similar to longboard skateboarding.’

When the wheels are connected by a metal pole, the toy is most similar to a casterboard (pictured), which is a narrow, flexible skateboard with a metal 'spine' and two wheels that can travel in any direction

Composition: Two 10-inch wheels, which riders position their feet inside. The wheels can be used independently as skates, or joined with a metal bar to form a 'board'.

How to use it: Annular skates are propelled by leaning side to side, to let a user skateboard without pushing off the ground - like using a casterboard.

Tricks: When the toy is used like inline skates, riders can perform 720° spins.

Price: $100 (£67) 

When the wheels are connected by a metal pole, the toy is most similar to a casterboard, which is a skateboard with two wheels that can travel in any direction.

‘The included extendable rod can be connected to both wheels, providing stability to novices and hastening the learning period,’ the catalogue says.

When the wheels are not connected and work more like inline skates, ‘riders can easily perform 720° spins and turn on a dime’.

Riders stop by placing their toes on the ground.

The wheels of the ‘board’ measure 10 inches in diameter (25cm) so that it can be used on uneven road surfaces and grass.

It costs $100 (£67) and is designed to be used by ages eight and upwards.

‘Riders simply place their feet on the two platforms and lean side-to-side to rotate the rubber wheels around the feet, propelling riders forward in a serpentine motion similar to  skateboarding,’ the catalogue says

A motorised skateboard with just one wheel has been created by a firm in San Francisco.

Called the Onewheel, the $1300 gadget has a single air filled tyre taken from a go-kart.

It can reach speeds on 12mph (19km/h), and turn 360 degrees within the length of the board - all while balancing itself using the same motion sensing technology found in a smartphone.

The firm behind it, Future Motion says it 'lets you fly over pavement on only a single wheel'.

'Onewheel represents a huge shift in the typically stagnant, technology starved world of boardsports,' said Kyle Doerksen, who invented the board.

Riders can accelerate up to 12mph (19km/h) by leaning towards their front foot. 

Leaning back slows down, or even reverses, and regenerative braking recharges the battery during deceleration.

Mr Doerksen says riding one is like flying.

'The first thing you'll notice when you get on Onewheel is that it's simultaneously familiar and unlike anything you've ever ridden.

'The technology enables it to ride much more smoothly than a skateboard and carve turns like on snow or a surfboard.'
