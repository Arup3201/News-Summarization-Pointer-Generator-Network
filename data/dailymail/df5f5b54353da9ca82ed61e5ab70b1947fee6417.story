Austrian drag queen Conchita Wurst has been crowned winner of this year's Eurovision Song Contest.

The singer, dubbed 'the bearded lady', was awarded a staggering 290 points for her performance of Rise Like a Phoenix in Copenhagen tonight.

Sporting a full beard and gold embellished fishtail gown, she took to the stage in front of a smokey backdrop, before giving a powerful performance of the song.

Winner: Austrian drag act Conchita Wurst has been crowned winner of this year's Eurovision Song Contest

When the 
results of the votes started coming in from across the continent, it 
soon became clear that this was, as the odds had predicted, a fight 
between Conchita Wurst, Sweden's Sanna Nielsen and The Netherlands' The 
Common Linnets.

As
 the voting came to a close, Conchita was in tears, mouthing 'thank you,
 thank you' to the camera as she raced ahead of the other entries and 
ended up with 290 points.

Wurst,
 the alter ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth, triumphed over the 25 
contestants in the contest, including British singer Molly 
Smitten-Downes, who came 17th with just 40 points.

The Netherlands, in second place, finished with 238 points and Sweden won third with 218 points.

The UK's hopes were pinned on Smitten-Downes as she battled it out in a bid to become the country's first Song
 Contest winner since 1997, despite the nations Prime Minister not knowing who she is.

Yesterday, David Cameron failed to identify the UK's entry and admitted he did not know who was hosting the show.

Asked if he would be watching, Mr Cameron said: 'Probably not, if I'm absolutely honest.'

Praise for
 Conchita's win took over Twitter, with many highlighting the 
significance of the Eurovision winner being genderneutral and 
representing the LGBTQ community in the wake of Russia's recent 
homophobic laws and persecutions.

John
 Bishop tweeted: It's only a song contest but tonight it showed talent 
can overcome prejudice and ignorance. Well done Conchita - I am glad I 
saw that moment'

Journalist Jay Rayner wrote: 'We take the p***out of Eurovision. It's a gagfest. But it's also a grand vehicle for an overt 'f*** you' liberalism in face of conservatism'

Russell
 Brand showed support and a sense of humour when he posted images of 
himself in a green shimmering dress in homage to his lookalike Conchita,
 adding: 'I don't normally endorse voting but please vote for me on 
#Eurovision tonight. #Austria'

BBC One's official Twitter took it even further writing: 'Conchita Wurst for the next James Bond theme! She has a licence to thrill. #Eurovision'

'Amazing': Celebrities and fans have taken to Twitter tonight to express their support for Molly Smitten-Downes

The UK's Molly Smitten-Downes wore a metallic gold dress with a fur collar as she performed self-penned Children Of The Universe in front of a captive audience in Copenhagen and millions of BBC viewers.

And within seconds of her performance ending, celebrities and fans had taken to Twitter to express their support for the singer.

Comedian
 John Bishop wrote: 'Molly is the best UK entry since Tie A Yellow 
Ribbon by Brotherhood of Man - I am now going to retire and enjoy my 
pipe and act my age!'

Meanwhile,
 TV presenter Davina McCall tweeted: '#EurovisionSongContest2014 Molly 
for the uk .... Amaaaaaaazing..... 10/10 (Had to really) but she is 
good!!'

And Olympic champion Greg Rutherford wrote: 'Molly can sing! (First time I've heard this)'.

But
 Smitten-Downes's performance was not enough to enable Britain to scoop the 
title of Song Contest winner as she was beaten by Wurst and 15 others.

Singer: Within seconds of the performance ending, hundreds of fans had taken to Twitter to congratulate her

Treat: Smitten-Downes was presented with a 'Curly Whirley cake' backstage following her performance 

Winner Conchita identifies as gender neutral but prefers to use female pronouns where this is needed.

Prior
 to her performance, Wurst had faced a barrage of homophobic and 
transphobic attacks from within her own country and from other countries
 including Russia, Armenia and Belarus, who branded the contest a 
'hotbed of sodomy', the BBC reported.

'I
 can only say thank you for your attention. If this is only about me and
 my person, I can live with it', Wurst previously said about her critics
 in emails.

'You know, I have a very thick skin. It's just strange that a little facial hair causes that much excitement.'

As she took the stage for a second time tonight - after being crowned 
winner - the transgender singer had tears in her eyes as she said: 
'Thank you, thank you so much.'

This
 year's Song Contest was hosted by last year's winners, Denmark, 
with Eurovision 2015 to be held in Austria's capital Vienna.

In second place: Runner-up The Common Linnets of The Netherlands was awarded 238 points

Number three: Sanna Nielsen representing Sweden with power-ballad Undo got 218 points

Opponent: Poland's Donata and Cleo perform 'My Slowianie - We Are Slavic' during tonight's Song Contest

Giving it their all: Firelight, representing Malta, perform 'Coming Home' during the Eurovision Song Contest 2014

Hosts: The 2014 Eurovision Song Contest was presented by Pilou Asbaek, Lise Ronne and Nikolaj Koppel

Smitten-Downes, from Leicestershire, went into the contest with the best odds Britain has had for years.

Britain, like France, Luxembourg and Sweden, has won the contest five times and finished runner-up on a record 15 occasions.

Only Ireland has won it more times, with seven successes since Eurovision started in 1956.

In 1967, Sandie Shaw took the title for the UK with Puppet On A String, followed two years later by Lulu with Boom Bang-a-Bang.

It
 took another seven years before Brotherhood Of Man performed Save Your 
Kisses For Me in 1976 and brought the accolade back to the UK.

In
 1981 Bucks Fizz won with Making Your Mind Up. And the last time Britain
 was crowned winner was in 1997 with Love Shine A Light by Katrina And 
The Waves.

Before 1998, the nation only finished outside the top 10 twice.

Since then, however, the entries have been branded a 'national joke', finishing towards the end of the table year after year.In 2003, 2008 and 2010, the acts finished last.
