The bloody battle for Kobane has become a spectacle  for local Turks who are being sold snacks by local vendors while they watch the fighting from nearby hills.

The battle for the Syrian border city has taken a dramatic turn  with 700 Kurdish residents left trapped inside the city after ISIS jihadists cut off its only escape route.

While the fighting continues, Turkish locals are gathering to watch the Kurds' last stand from the safety of distant hilltops, where they sit with binoculars and bagels delivered to them by local food sellers.

The battle for the city has raged for several weeks, but jihadists have now encircled the town to trap residents who haven't fled, as well as to stop ground support arriving.

Concerns are now being raised for 700 mainly elderly citizens who remain inside Kobane and  face massacre at the militants' hands.

Meanwhile, the UN has appealed to Turkey to allow any willing volunteers to cross the border into Syria to assist the massively outgunned Kurdish forces battling ISIS.

The situation has evoked memories of the breakup of Yugoslavia when Bosnian Serb forces marched into the town of Srebrenica, which was supposed to be under U.N. protection, and gunned down more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys at execution sites.

Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations' envoy to Syria, appealed to Turkey to let "volunteers" cross the frontier so that they can reinforce Kurdish militias defending the town that lies within sight of Turkish territory.

He revived memories of the breakup of Yugoslavia when Bosnian Serb forces marched into the town of Srebrenica, which was supposed to be under U.N. protection, and gunned down more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys at execution sites.

'Do you remember Srebrenica? We do. We never forgot and probably we never forgave ourselves,' de Mistura said.

Turkey has stationed tanks on hills overlooking Kobani but so far refused to intervene without a comprehensive deal with the United States and other allies on the Syrian civil war. It has also prevented Turkish Kurds from crossing the frontier to reinforce their fellow Kurds defending the town.

He added: 'We would like to appeal to the Turkish authorities... to allow the flow of volunteers at least and their own equipment in order to be able to enter the city and contribute to a self-defence action.'

While much of the population has already fled the Islamic State offensive, 500-700 mostly elderly people were still sheltering in the mainly Kurdish town, while 10,000-13,000 were also trapped nearby in a border area between Syria and Turkey.Â 

They were all likely to be massacred if the last remaining exit point from Kobani fell, de Mistura said.

'When there is an imminent threat to civilians, we cannot, we should not, be silent.'
