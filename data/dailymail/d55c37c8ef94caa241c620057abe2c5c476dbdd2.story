Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann has been under the protection of federal law enforcement officials since last week, a news report revealed today, in response to a death threat she received from ISIS. 

Law enforcement officials would not give out details on the threat Bachmann received other than to say that it occurred online and the congresswoman's office declined to discuss the incident, according to Politico, the news publication that broke the story.

However, police indicated to Politico that the Minnesota lawmaker will be under watch until her final term in Congress ends early next year. Bachmann opted not to run for reelection this fall and is set to return to public life in January.

Rep. Michele Bachmann speaks at the annual Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference in Washington in D.C. in June. Bachmann has been under the protection of federal law enforcement officials since last week after receiving an online threat from ISIS 

Throughout her congressional career Bachmann has been one of the most vocal opponents on Capitol Hill of radical Islam. At times she has come under fire from her colleagues - Republican and Democrat alike - for being overzealous in her quest to find and expose terrorists.

In a Washington, D.C. speech before a conservative audience last month, Bachmann went after ISIS directly and said in no uncertain terms that the group should be decimated.

While criticizing President Barack Obama's approach to crippling the extremist group, the Republican firebrand said the correct response to their killing spree in Iraq and Syria is to 'kill their leader, you kill their counsel, kill their army until they wave the white flag of surrender!' 

'I believe if you have an evil of an order of this magnitude, you take it seriously,' she said moments before.

'You declare war on it, you don’t dance around it. Just like the Islamic State has declared war on the United States of America.'

Bachmann has used her little remaining time in the House to try to pass legislation torpedoing ISIS' ability to infiltrate the United States to commit acts of terror.

The four-term Congresswoman said in September that the Federal Bureau of Investigation told her that American who go overseas to fight with ISIS will be allowed to come back to the U.S., where they will be simply be put on a watch list.

'We need to ‘get a brain in the United States and wake up,' Bachmann told Newsmax. 'Because the Islamic State has been very clear about their intention. 

'That’s why they call themselves the Islamic State. They see that the global caliphate literally goes around the world, including the United States.'

Before Congress left for a six-week recess last month Bachmann introduced legislation that would strip Americans who join the ranks of ISIS of their citizenship. 

Bachmann has not said what she plans to do when she leaves Washington, but she told Fox News last year that she plans to stay active in politics.

'I’m not retiring,' she said. 'I’m not going silent. I’m not the quitting my public involvement. In fact, I may run for another public office. 

'But for right now I think I’m going to find a different perch in order to be able to weigh in on the matters. Sometimes you be more effective on the outside than on the inside.'

The 2012 presidential candidate hinted earlier this year at a possible run for higher office in 2016. She has since announced that she will not seek the Republican nomination to the presidency next year.
