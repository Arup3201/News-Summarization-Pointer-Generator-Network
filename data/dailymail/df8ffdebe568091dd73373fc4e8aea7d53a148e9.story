Don Marsh is accused of misusing company money to pay for hundreds for trips, while buying expensive gifts for friends and family and funding a series of mistresses

The former CEO of the Marsh Supermarkets chain appeared in federal court in Indianapolis on Monday to face allegations that he defrauded the company out of millions of dollars to fund his extravagant lifestyle.

The lawsuit against Don Marsh accuses him of misusing company money to pay for hundreds for trips, including fishing jaunts to Alaska, while buying expensive gifts for friends and family and funding a series of mistresses.

Marsh’s attorney told the nine-person jury that his client wasn’t perfect but had always acted in the best interests of the supermarket chain which has almost 100 branches, almost exclusively throughout Central Indiana.

‘Now, Don Marsh made some mistakes 
along the way,’ said Andrew McNeil. ‘He had more than one extramarital 
affair. He’s not perfect, but he gave his all to Marsh Supermarkets.’

In
court documents, the company has said that Marsh ‘treated Marsh 
Supermarkets as his personal piggy bank,’ taking more than 350 
company-reimbursed trips from 1990 to 2006  which kept him out of the 
office for six months of every year.

The lawsuit claims Marsh used the company plane and funds to 'facilitate several extramarital relationships,' including one with a Russian ice-show director for whom the company paid for an apartment in New York, legal bills related to her immigration status and flights to Indianapolis to visit Marsh.

Another mistress was the the company's director of community affairs, who the company then 'negotiated a resolution,' which involved her leaving the company.

According to the lawsuit, the CEO often flew on the company jet ‘to take female employees on vague business trips to places such as Chicago or New York City’ and New Orleans, where he sometimes ‘spent significant amounts of money at various department stores.’

In 2005, Marsh flew two planeloads of family and friends to New York for the Macy¿s parade also at the company's expense

The CEO also attended what were called executive outings in Alaska that the lawsuit claims were fishing trips that involved few employees and cost $100,000 or more per outing.

The company’s jet was also used by Marsh to visit his four vacation homes in Aspen, Col;  Saugatuck, Mich; the Dominican Republic and Naples in southern Italy.

The lawsuit says the CEO also used company money to pay for his son's foreign travel in 2004 and 2005 to Africa and New Zealand at a total cost of $149,000.

In 2005, Marsh flew two planeloads of family and friends to New York for the Macy’s parade also at the company's expense.

The company also claims that Marsh bought expensive gifts for family and friends but passed them off as business expenses. On one occasion he spent $1,000 on two pairs of boots - one for a guide on a hunting trip, the other for the guide's girlfriend.

‘Mr. Marsh took what didn't belong to 
him over and over and over,’ company attorney David Herzog said in his 
opening statement to the jury. ‘He got caught and now he has to pay it 
back.’

The company claims that Marsh took 'executive outings' in Alaska that were really fishing trips that involved few employees and cost $100,000 or more per trip

In 2006 Marsh sold the struggling supermarket chain for $88 million to the Florida-based asset management firm Sun Capital

Marsh, now 75-years-old and retired, is making a counter claim going against the company. He denies that he owes them compensation and is claims they owe him $2 million in withheld severance benefits, reports Indystar.com.

In April 2006, Marsh organized the sale of the then struggling supermarket chain for $88 million to the Florida-based asset management firm Sun Capital. He resigned soon after.

The supermarket chain was founded by Marsh’s father Ermal, who died in a plane crash in 1959. Don Marsh grew up in the company, he started bagging groceries as a boy and after his father’s death he joined the board and became its president in 1968 before he turned 30.

During Marsh’s tenure running the company gained a reputation as an innovator and was one of the first to introduce computer-read customer loyalty cards.

Marsh’s attorney suggested to the jury that his client’s innovative business approach explained why he had to travel so widely, including meeting world leaders Cuba’s Fidel Castro and Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi.

‘He was able to wine and dine suppliers with heads of state... around the world,’ McNeil said. ‘He was not just sitting behind his desk on 96th Street in Indianapolis.’

He claims the company knew all along what Marsh was spending and is now attempting to change the rules.

The company was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service for more than $5 million in improper deductions for executive expenses during Marsh’s time as CEO. The company settled with the IRS in 2011 by paying an undisclosed negligence penalty.

The company has said it intends to ask for punitive damages against Don Marsh that could run as much as three times its compensatory claims of several million dollars.

Marsh has described the suit an effort to smear and tarnish his reputation. The trial is expected to last two weeks if no out-of-court settlement is reached before then.
