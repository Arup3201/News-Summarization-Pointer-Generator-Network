A Swiss couple have come forward to claim that the mysterious 'Forest Boy' is their grandson.

The pair are due to give a DNA sample which will be tested against that of the boy, Ray, who appeared in Berlin last month claiming to have been living in the forest for five years.

Berlin's B.Z. newspaper today reported that Ray's photo was seen by the couple in Switzerland and they then contacted police. 

Ray's past: Experts are struggling to work out who the boy really is and what has happened to him

There was no official comment from authorities in Berlin and no further detail in the newspaper report.

Police and social workers began suspecting two weeks ago that Ray's story was bogus and that his motives were suspect. 

He is only 17 and now in the care of social workers after a legal guardian was appointed to represent his interests.

If it is found that he comes from Switzerland he will be deported back there.

The blonde, blue-eyed boy claimed to remember few details about his life when he turned up on the steps of a town hall in the east of Berlin on September 5.

Lost in translation: The boy turned up in Berlin alone and saying he had been living rough in the woods

He told a tale - in accented English -
that gripped the imagination of the world. He said he had been living 
in a tent in a forest for five years with his father, called Ryan, and 
that his mother Doreen had died in a car crash five years previously.

He said that his father died suddenly in the woods and he began walking towards Berlin. He said he had buried his father among the trees.

'I'm all alone, please help me,' he said. 

He was taken into care at a cost to the German taxpayer of around £2,500 per month. 

Wilderness: The teenager's history is shrouded in darkness - but this new claim could shed new light on his history

But his tall tale soon began to develop more holes than a Swiss cheese.

A check of police computers in all 16 states of Germany found that no one by the name of Doreen had died in a car crash in the past decade.

No sign of a grave has been found in cursory searches of forests in the Harz Mountains, along the Bavarian-Czech border or in Thuringia.

Ray is unable to pinpoint the forest where he said he lived, he is also unable to say what nationality he is. Officials originally thought he could be British because he speaks English but only basic German, although they now doubt this.

The tent he carried did not look as if it had sustained five years of treatment in a German forest and Ray was well dressed and clean.

As Interpol was alerted to check with police forces for missing people in other European countries, Ray triggered more suspicion when he said he did not want to pose for photographs or make an appeal to try to find any of his family.

'They're all dead,' he said.  'I just want to get on and make a new life for myself.'

A police spokesman said: 'Unfortunately it seems that the boy told his guardian that he wasn't interested in discovering who he was.'

But now the Swiss link is the most promising development so far. 

If true, Germany would be in a position to make a claim from Switzerland for money towards Ray's upkeep so far.
