Comedian Russell Brand has revealed his plans for a new chain of non-profit businesses which would boast their own currency.

The left-wing activist was on the New Era council estate in Hoxton, east London, to open a new cafe today where he gave a speech - hours after he was voted one of the world's greatest thinkers.

Brand said he will donate all money from the paperback sales of his book 'Revolution', to The Trew Cafe, which will be staffed by recovering addicts undergoing 'abstinence-based recovery'.

The left-wing activist told the 200-strong crowd that he plans to donate the money made from his book 'Revolution' towards the cafe

It is also on the site where he previously helped locals protesting against rent increases and possible eviction despite living in a £2million bachelor pad owned by a firm based in a tax haven. 

Speaking outside the cafe, which is named after the estate fused with his YouTube show, The Trews, he said: 'It is a model that is not for profit, a fully self-supporting, new economic enterprise.'

He ambitiously claimed that he plans to set up more of these social enterprises, adding: 'Eventually we will trade with one another in our own currency.

'We are going to create our own systems, our own federations, our own currencies, our own authorities.'

He was joined at the opening by several local residents including Lynsay Spiteri (right of Brand), Danielle Molinari (far right) and Lindsey Garrett (left)

The 39-year-old, who was joined by a crowd of 200 supporters, also accused mainstream political parties of abandoning people on inner city estates.

'As long as you have only got parties that are interested in causing division, hatred and representing big businesses, we will create our own systems,' he said.

'Politics is dead, this is the end of politics. What we are discussing is what comes after, something worse or something better.'

The stand-up act added that 'it is not a charity, it is a new business model', describing it as a place for local people to get together and eat food grown and made in the community.

It came the day after he was named as the world's fourth greatest thinker by readers of intellectual magazine Prospect.

The self-styled revolutionary beat the likes of Nobel peace prize winner Henry Kissinger and Booker prize recipient Hilary Mantel to make it into the top ten list of influential minds.

In its latest edition, Prospect described Brand as 'the spiritual leader of Britain's disaffected anti-capitalist youth', but it has since faced backlash for including the anarchist on social media. 

Drayton Bird ‏wrote on Twitter: 'Beyond parody: if this wag is a great thinker, my vote goes to Peppa Pig.'

Tim Walker added: 'A generation or so ago, Bertrand Russell was considered to be a great thinker. Now, comically, it's Russell Brand.'

The television and radio presenter  lost his BBC Radio 2 slot over prank calls to actor Andrew Sachs in 2008.

Since then the millionaire attempted to re-brand himself as an anti-capitalist revolutionary, but it has been mired in doubt as celebrities including Simon Cowell accused him  of hypocrisy.

He accused the comedian of accepting large Hollywood film salaries whilst campaigning against the UK political system.
