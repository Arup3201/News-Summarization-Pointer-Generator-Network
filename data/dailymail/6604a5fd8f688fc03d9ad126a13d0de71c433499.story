Islamic State targets in Iraq are being 'hit hard' by Australian military aircraft.

The Australian Air Task Group (ATG) has flown 144 sorties since September, including bombings of bases, equipment and vehicles operated by IS, also known as ISIL.

Australians have been involved 144 missions since September, deploying 25 bombs and hitting 14 targets. 

The ADF confirmed that 11 of those targets had been completely destroyed. They could not confirm which terrorists had been killed by the air raids, nor if any of them were IS terrorists from Australia. 

The ADF’s chief of Joint Operations Command, David Johnston also announced that 200 soldier will be deployed in Baghdad to give assistance to counter terrorism units, advising them on their battle against the IS.

'Operations provided by coalition aircraft in support of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) are slowing ISIL's progress,' he said in a statement on Wednesday.

'While some areas in the west and north are being contested by ISIL, with gains and losses by ISF and Kurdish Peshmerga forces, ISIL capability continues to be hit hard.'

It is the first time Australia has led the charge in a multinational attack, managing to 'seamlessly' form the partnership with 'just two weeks notice', according to Director General of Air Operations, Air Commodore Joe Iervasi.

A total of 437 strike missions have been deployed by the Coalition in Iraq and Syria.
