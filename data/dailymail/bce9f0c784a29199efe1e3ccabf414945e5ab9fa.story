A West Java court sentenced Jake Drage, 23, to nine months in jail for the June crash that claimed the life of a local mother, Kokom

While prosecutors pressed for 18 months jail, Drage will only serve another six after being in the West Java jail for three months already.  

Kokom's husband Iim, has further expressed that he sees her killer as  his son, and has attended each of Drage's six court appearances, in disbelief at how it ever came to this.  

Mr Iim never wanted the ex-personal trainer charged, and doesn't blame him for the collision that threw his wife off the back of a motorbike controlled by their teenage daughter, Mela.

'I care about him so much ... he's like our son,' he said .

'It's too sad what's happening with him. Many times, I can't help myself and I cry on seeing him.'

Prosecutors in the case have argued Drage was overtaking a small truck at such a speed it made the crash unavoidable. They have argued for 18 months jail.

Drage had been in Sumatra before his Indonesian adventure took him to the surfing town of Cimaja, West Java.

On his second day there, he says, he rescued a woman from Jakarta who was in trouble in the surf.

He was on his way to see her again, on his third day in town, when Mela's bike appeared in his path.

Their handlebars clipped, flinging Kokom on to the road.

Drage's trial heard how on seeing the blood on the asphalt, he screamed 'Oh my God'.

Kokom was rushed to hospital where she was pronounced dead.

Mr Iim says the fact the Drage didn't try to dodge responsibility counts for everything

For Mr Iim, the fact this young Aussie didn't try to dodge responsibility counts for everything.

'He didn't run away, they've helped us with many things, that's enough for us,' he said.

Mr Iim's relative Andika Hidayat was called to help Drage after the crash because no one else could speak English, including the police.

On meeting the distraught Australian, he says he 'just knew' he was a good person.

Until Drage's Western Australia-based mother Tiena arrived with a lawyer, Mr Andika ensured Drage was coping in police custody, sending food and company.

Tiena Drage has also been sheltered by the community throughout the four-month ordeal.

She first reached out to Mr Iim's family to pay for the funeral, but their friendship has grown since.

At the most recent court date, they sat as one group, chatting and joking to lighten the mood.

Mr Andika says for him, it makes sense for the families to unite. Sixteen-year-old Mela is missing a mother, and Ms Drage is missing her child.

'It's like all the children have a new mum because she's like mum to them,' he said.

'But three and a half months Jake's been in jail now. In my opinion, he shouldn't be.'  

Drage had faced a maximum six years in jail and a possible maximum fine of $1100.
