The discovery of three mammoth pythons at a home may be a nightmare for some but Julie Baker simply can't get enough of them.

The professional snake catcher - dubbed the Snake Sheila - was called out to a home in Ashgrove, northwest of Brisbane, on Wednesday morning.

A resident had found the carpet pythons, each about 2m long, on the rafters of her verandah.

Ms Baker was in her element when she arrived at the home to find three snakes, saying in a video she posted online: 'That is cool, only snake catchers think that's cool.'

The three snakes, believed to be two males and one female, were found on the rafters of a verandah

A resident called Julia Baker, who posted video footage of the snakes online, to help catch the reptiles on Wednesday morning

Ms Baker says it's common to find snakes hanging out in the area especially during mating season

Ms Baker says she caught the three snakes and took them to a nearby nature reserve park

Video footage of the three carpet pythons was uploaded on the Facebook page of 1300 Catch It - a snake removal business run by Ms Baker.

She believes there were two males and one female out on the verandah due to mating season.

But while Ms Baker relocated them to a nearby nature reserve park, the resident called back some time later to tell her that she found another male snake in the same area to look for the female.

'Females give off this strong scent for male snakes, although we can't smell it, during mating season,' she said.

'So the males are really driven by this scent and that's probably why another one turned up.' 

The 45-year-old, who's been catching snakes for more than four years, says she first fell in love with the legless reptiles 10 years ago.

Ms Baker is also known as the Snake Sheila and has been a professional snake catcher for more than four years

Ms Baker says she hopes to change the perception on the widely-feared creatures and 'show that they're not aggressive'

'It was when I touched one for the first time 10 years ago at Australia Zoo,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'They're [snakes] are gorgeous. They're so gentle and gracious but really misunderstood.'

While she's unfazed by the widely-feared creatures, she admits that she can't stand cockroaches.

'Well I can't handle cockroaches but I can handle snakes,' she said.

'They have too many legs.'

Ms Baker, from the nearby suburb of Eaton Hills, quit her job as a pastry chef to become a snake handler.

'Since then it's been my mission to change the perception that a "good snake is a dead snake",' she said.

'I want to change the attitude about snakes and show that they're not aggressive.'
