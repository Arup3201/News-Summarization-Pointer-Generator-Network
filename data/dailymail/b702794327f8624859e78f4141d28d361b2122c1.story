Many dieters attempt to fill themselves up with water in the belief it will help them lose weight.

But one nutrition expert says it is simply a myth that drink water aids slimming.

Dr Beth Kitchin, at the University of Alabama, has stated that drinking water is not a magical key to weight loss.

She said: ‘There is very little evidence that drinking water promotes weight loss - it is one of those self-perpetuating myths.

‘I'm not saying drinking water isn't good - but only one study showed people who drank more water burned a few extra calories, and it was only a couple of extra calories a day.’

Dr Kitchin added that it is also a myth that people should drink eight glasses of water a day.

She said: ‘Yes, people do need to get fluids - but it does not have to be water. There's no evidence that it melts away fat or makes you feel fuller, so if you don't like water it's OK.’

She explained that water is the best liquid to drink to hydrate but that green tea, coffee and squash are also hydrating.

She said: ‘People think coffee doesn't count, but actually it does.

‘When you drink coffee, your body is retaining much of that fluid - especially for people who are habituated to drinking caffeine, as the body adapts, resulting in a reduced loss of fluids.’

Dr Kitchin said some people also believe that drinking very cold water can help them lose weight.

She believes this can increase the number of calories burned but that it does not have sufficient impact to aid weight loss.

The bad news for dieters is that Dr Kitchin says the only way to lose weight is to eat fewer calories.

She suggests focussing on eating fruit, vegetables and soups.

Dr Kitchin's claims contradict 2013 research which found that drinking two cups of water before a meal can help people lose weight.

The research, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, suggested drinking water can reduce hunger meaning dieters consume fewer calories.
