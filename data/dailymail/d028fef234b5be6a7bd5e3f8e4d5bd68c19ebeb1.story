When Ronald Koeman had a quiet word in Nathaniel Clyne's ear earlier this summer, not even the Dutchman could have known the impact it would have.

New managerial appointments often breed apprehension among players. Am I in the team? Am I out? Will he keep me? Will I be sold?

Clyne was no different. That was until a conversation with his new manager during pre-season.

The defender was told in no uncertain terms by his new boss that he would be the club's first choice right back this season.

It was music to Clyne's ears; with the seeds from that discussion now bearing fruit.

His performances so far this season have been excellent. So good in fact that there's now a growing clamour for him to be given England recognition.

More performances like his against Arsenal on Tuesday night then surely Roy Hodgson will have to sit up and take notice.

'Yes, I think he is ready for England,' said Koeman.

'He has a lot of experience. He is playing very well from the beginning of the season and scored a great goal and his performance is very good and he is an option for the national coach.

'But I’m very happy to have him in our team because he brings a lot of quality and experience. It is very important for the team.'

So it raises the question, have Manchester United bought the wrong Southampton full back?

Luke Shaw's talent is undoubted, and if all goes according to plan, will become one of the world's elite left backs.

Louis van Gaal also decided to bring in Argentina's left-sided defender Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon

But the capture of Marcos Rojo, who can play at left back or centre back, has raised doubts over Shaw's place in Louis van Gaal's plans.

As did comments from former United coach and Van Gaal's countryman Rene Meulensteen, who claimed the Old Trafford manager doesn't rate Shaw.

Van Gaal also has problems on the other side of his defence. Rafael currently occupies the right-back spot, despite the fact the Dutchman was open to selling him in the summer transfer window.

Perhaps a look at the other side of Southampton's defence last season would have been more beneficial for United.

Clyne's rise to prominence has been steady.

Neil Warnock, during his first stint in charge at Crystal Palace, plucked the unknown Clyne from the club's academy and straight into his first team in 2008.

All the hype at the time centred on Victor Moses and John Bostock. Very little had been mentioned about Clyne - who was just 17 at the time.

But it didn't take long for the youngster to establish himself as the club's first-choice right back ahead of the experienced Danny Butterfield.

It didn't take long for Premier League scouts to take notice, either.

Arsenal and Manchester United were regulars at Selhurst Park to keep tabs on Clyne.

However, it was Wolves who put their money where their mouths were in 2010, as they saw a bid for Clyne accepted only for the defender to turn down a move to Molineux.

Two years later, however, Clyne got his switch to the Premier League, with newly-promoted Southampton signing the defender on a four-year deal.

More performances like Tuesday night's and Clyne could be on the move again before too long.
