Accusation: Former teachers said Mr Farage was 'a fascist' and 'a racist' when he attended Dulwich College

Nigel Farage was last night accused of having been a racist when he was a schoolboy.

The claim came as he prepared to tell his party that leaving the European Union was the ‘only way’ to deal with the pressures of immigration.

On the eve of the UK Independence Party’s conference today, Channel Four News broadcast comments from teachers at Dulwich College that the teenage Farage was a ‘fascist’ and a ‘racist’ when a pupil at the private London school in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

A letter from 1981 claims Mr Farage, now 49, was even heard ‘shouting Hitler Youth songs’. The claims did not prevent him being appointed as a prefect at the school.

The Ukip leader last night played down the significance of the claims, which he said were made by left-wing teachers who disliked his views. He denied singing Nazi songs.

Mr Farage said: ‘Yes of course I said some ridiculous things, not necessarily racist things. It depends how you define it.

‘You’ve got to remember that ever since 1968 up until the last couple of years, we’ve not been able in this country, intelligently to discuss immigration, to discuss integration, it’s all been a buried subject.’

He added: ‘Was I a difficult, bolshie teenager who pushed the boundaries of debate further than I should? Yes. Have I ever been a member  of an extremist organisation? No, I have not.’

Mr Farage was backed last night by a former Dulwich College master Terry Walsh, who said the complaints  were ‘probably a reflection on the staff, not on him – there was quite a strong left-wing element’.

Mr Farage will attempt to put the claims behind him when he addresses his party’s conference in London.

He will tell activists Ukip is poised to cause a political ‘earthquake’ if it can top the poll in next year’s European Parliament elections.

Education: Mr Farage attended Dulwich College, a private school in south-east London

And he will urge the party to put the issue of immigration from the EU at the heart of its campaign – and use it  to press the Government to block the free access of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria, due to start at the beginning of next year.

‘That is my challenge to them. If they ignore it we must turn the euro elections into the referendum that we have not been given,’ he will say.

He will insist Ukip is not against all immigration, but that ‘sheer weight of numbers’ is putting too much strain on public services and driving down wages for the low-skilled.

Immigration from Bulgaria and Romania will also see crime gangs flooding in to Britain, he will add.But he will say the main parties are powerless to deal with the issue as clamping down on EU immigration is against Brussels rules.
