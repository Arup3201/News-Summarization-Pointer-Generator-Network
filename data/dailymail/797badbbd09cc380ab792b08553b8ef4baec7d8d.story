While fruit growers are doing well out of the unseasonably sunny weather winter has had one last hurrah after snow fell across parts of the UK last night.

With British Summer Time just days away the Met Office was forced to issue a severe weather warning overnight after rain turned into sleet and snow as it moved eastwards, causing dangerous driving conditions across much of the north.

More unsettled weather is expected to hit the UK over the weekend when the clocks go forward.

 Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said 2cm of snow was recorded overnight in Spadeadam, Cumbria.

'We have had a couple of centimetres over the Pennines, Cumbria and North Yorkshire, and over some of the higher ground in Scotland,' he said.

'There was also some in Northern Ireland but that has cleared now.

'We have had no reports of any impact from it, no road closures. It's a fairly light covering.'

Mr Partridge said it is not unusual for snow to fall at this time of year.

'We're even more likely to get snow now than at Christmas because the coldest months are January, February and March,' he explained.

Conditions are expected to improve in many places today and tomorrow, before an unsettled weekend.

'The winds should ease through the course of the afternoon and some places should see some decent sunshine,' Mr Partridge said. 'Southern areas of the UK could see 12C (54F), so not too bad.

'Tomorrow mainly South West parts of the UK will see patchy rain. Everywhere else will be cloudy but dry.

'From Saturday through the course of the weekend we could see strong winds with some gales in western areas of the UK.

'All parts of the country will see spells of rain at times with some dry periods, so quite unsettled and generally windy weather through the course of the weekend.

'Temperatures will be up to the low to mid teens, but it won't feel like that due to the wind and rain.' 

Meanwhile English raspberries have made their earliest ever appearance on supermarket shelves after a trial crop was grown during the sunniest winter since records began - despite snow continuing to blanket parts of the UK.

Waitrose have announced they will stock the Chichester glasshouse-grown Diamond Jubilee berries from today, and say it is the first time consumers have been able to enjoy locally grown varieties in March.

The early delivery of raspberries follows British-grown strawberries becoming available two weeks earlier than in previous years.

This is thanks to the weather this winter which the Met Office has said was the sunniest since records began in 1929.

While the figures for rainfall and temperature were average, the number of sunny days was 125 per cent of the long-term average.

Laurence Olins, chairman of industry body British Summer Fruits, said the raspberries were the result of a trial plot of the 'very sweet' Diamond Jubilee berries planted by Harry Hall, who supplied Waitrose with the first strawberries of the season earlier this month.

Just 200kg of the berries, which are grown in glasshouses, are expected this week but there should be around a tonne produced every week afterwards.

Mr Olins said: 'This is probably the earliest we've seen English raspberries - around two weeks earlier than normal.' 

Waitrose's raspberry buyer Nicki Baggott said: 'This is the first time we've been able to offer British-grown raspberries so early in the year.

'It's incredibly unusual to have these ready in March, but a combination of growing techniques and the perfect weather have meant we can sell these juicy delights earlier than ever.'

Raspberries were once regarded as a late summer crop, but British Summer Fruits said growers are using new varieties and innovative methods to extend the season.

English raspberries have made their earliest ever appearance after a trial crop was grown during the sunniest winter since records began

The greenhouse-grown English raspberries have made their earliest ever appearance on supermarket shelves today.

They went on sale after a trial crop was grown during the sunniest winter since records began.

Waitrose are stocking the Chichester  Diamond Jubilee berries from today.

It is a large berry, light in colour and firm with a good shelf life.

Last year the crop was only available in small volumes with just 20 tonnes produced.

It is the first time consumers have been able to enjoy locally grown varieties in March.

Normally greenhouse-grown raspberries are not ready until at least mid-April.

The Diamond Jubilee raspberry was created to commemorate the Queen's reign in 2012.

Raspberries grown outside (not in a greenhouse) are expected to be on sale later than usual this year - in late May or early June, following the particularly cold but sunny winter.
