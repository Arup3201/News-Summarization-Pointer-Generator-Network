Becky Liddle was also left temporarily unable to speak after collapsing at school due to a stroke

A nine-year-old schoolgirl has been left paralysed down her right side after suffering a stroke.

Becky Liddle, from Hull, also was unable to speak in the first few days after the event and has spent the last month being tube fed in hospital.

Her mother Michelle claims doctors originally thought Becky was suffering a huge migraine - but tests later revealed she had sufffered a stroke.

Mrs Liddle, 45, said: 'The first I heard was when the school called me to say Becky had passed out.

'As I walked outside I saw an ambulance go past with the blue lights on and I just knew it was for her.

'I don’t drive so a teacher came and picked me up and when I arrived at the school I could see Becky being taken off in a stretcher.

'She couldn’t move her right side and her face had dropped and I just knew she had had a stroke.

'Her father Andrew had one seven years ago and I recognised the symptoms. I was really shocked it could happen to someone as young as Becky.'

Becky was rushed to Hull Royal Infirmary where inconclusive test results led doctors to think she may have suffered a severe migraine.

But her mother remained unconvinced. 'I had seen my husband suffer a stroke and my mother’s instinct was telling me it was something more than a migraine.'

And two days later doctors confirmed her fears after scan results revealed she had a blood clot, which had caused the stroke.

Doctors have been unable to confirm whether she will regain movement, her mother said.

'She is so young but she has made a 
steady improvement over the past few weeks,' said Mrs Liddle, who works 
as a lollipop lady. 'We are staying hopeful.'

While people over 65 are at higher risk of stroke, a person of any age can have a stroke, including teenagers, children, newborns and unborn babies.

It is estimated that stroke affects about 6 in 100,000 children.

According to the National Stroke Association, symptoms in younger people and children include:

Sudden difficulty speaking, slurring of words or trouble understanding speech

A weakness on one side of the body

Sudden loss of vision or abnormal eye movements

Sudden loss of balance or trouble walking

Worsening or sudden headaches

Seizures, especially in newborns

She added: 'Doctors think Becky had some sort of neck trauma that tore an artery in her neck a week or so before it happened.'

One cause of stroke after trauma is a tear in the head or neck blood vessels that lead to the brain, which can be a source of blood clots that cause a stroke.

'We have no idea how she suffered the neck trauma,' said Mrs Liddle. 'The doctors asked me if she had been on any rollercoaster, but she definitely hadn't.'

She and her husband Andrew, 54, now want to raise awareness that anyone can suffer a stroke, no matter what their age.

Michelle said: 'Before this happened to Becky I would never have thought someone so young could suffer in this way, but the symptoms still apply for youngsters and we have found out anyone can suffer a stroke.

'We are just hoping for a speedy recovery for Becky, so she can get her life back on track.'

And despite spending the last month being tube fed in Leeds Royal Infirmary, Becky has not shed a tear, her mother said. 

'She has been so strong so, I have to be too. If Becky isn’t crying 
then how can I? She has been so brave it’s incredible,'
