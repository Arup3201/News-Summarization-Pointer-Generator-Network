The National Rifle Association on Sunday forcefully stuck to its call for placing armed police officers and security guards in every school as the best way to avoid shootings such as the recent massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.

Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the vocal gun rights lobbying organization, said the NRA would push Congress to pay for more school security guards and would coordinate efforts to put former military and police offers in schools as volunteer guards.

'If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy,' LaPierre said in a broadcast interview. 'I think the American people think it's crazy not to do it. It's the one thing that would keep people safe.

On NBC's Meet the Press National Rifle Association chief Wayne LaPierre Sunday refused to support new gun control legislation and maintained his support for putting armed guards and police in schools

Speaking on NBC's 'Meet the Press' LaPierre also contended that any new efforts by Congress to regulate guns or ammunition would not prevent mass shootings.

His comments on NBC's 'Meet the Press' reinforced the position that the NRA took on Friday when it broke its weeklong silence on the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

That stand has described by some lawmakers as tone-deaf.

Senator Charles Schumer, says LaPierre blames everything but guns for a series of mass shootings in recent years.

'Trying to prevent shootings in schools without talking about guns is like trying to prevent lung cancer without talking about cigarettes,' Schumer said.

The NRA plans to develop a school emergency response program that would include volunteers from the group's 4.3 million members to help guard children, and has named former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., as national director of the program.

Hutchinson said local districts should make decisions about armed guards in schools.

The National Rifle Association remained defiant amid calls for more gun restrictions in the wake of the Newtown tragedy, calling instead for armed guards in American schools

'I've made it clear that it should not be a mandatory law, that every school has this. There should be local choice, but absolutely, I believe that protecting our children with an armed guard who is trained is an important part of the equation,' he told ABC's 'This Week.'

LaPierre said that now the United States is spending $2 billion to train police in Iraq and asked why federal funds could not be transfered to train school guards to protect schools in the United States.

He also spoke about restricting the size of ammunition magazines and clips and said: 'I don't believe that's going to make one difference. There are so many different ways to evade that, even if you had that.

'You had that for 10 years when Senator Dianne Feinstein passed that ban in 1994. It was on the books. Columbine occurred right in the middle of it - it didn't make any difference.'

Senator Feinstein was the author of a 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons which expired in 2004. She has recently announced that she will attempt to write new legislation on those types of weapon next year.

No new regulations: NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre broke his organization's silence on Friday rejecting new gun control measures and calling for more security and guns in schools

Divided: Wayne LaPierre's statement was interrupted twice by protests blaming the NRA for a culture of violence

'I know there’s a media machine in this country that wants to blame guns every time something happens,' LaPierre said, but he insisted that an armed guard might have been able to stop Adam Lanza, the killer in Connecticut.

'If I’m a mom or a dad and I’m dropping my child off at school I’d feel a whole lot safer'.

However, the NRA chief did concede that 'nothing is perfect' in the battle to deter crime.

LaPierre also trained his sights on mental health care in the United States.

'We have a mental health system in this country that has completely and totally collapsed. We have no national database of these lunatics,' said LaPierre.

'We have a completely cracked mentally ill system that’s got these monsters walking the streets,'

The controversial chief said that many states do not put their records of the mentally ill into a national instant check system that is designed to screen them from buying weapons.

He also said that the federal gvernment has not invested in a law preventing convicted felons from possessing guns.

He said, 'If you want to control violent criminals, take them off the street.'

Meanwhile, President Obama has asked Vice President Joe Biden with drawing up new gun legislation - with a deadline of early next month.

When asked about this initiative, LaPierre said, 'if it’s a panel that’s just going to be made up of a bunch of people that for the past 20 years has been trying to destroy the Second Amendment, I’m not interested in sitting on that panel…. The NRA is not going to let people lose the Second Amendment in this country.'

Passion: Before the NRA's statement on Friday President Obama released a video calling for public support for gun control

Following LaPierre on Meet the Press, Sen. Charles Schumer, D- N.Y., said that the NRA leader is 'so extreme and so tone deaf that he actually helps the cause of us passing sensible gun legislation in the Congress…. He is so doctrinaire and so adamant that I believe gun owners turn against him as well.'

Schumer said that LaPierre believes 'the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is good gun with a gun. What about trying to stop the bad guy from getting the gun in the first place? That’s common sense. Most Americans agree with it.'

Gun-control advocates reacted with disbelief Friday to LaPierre’s call for armed guards in every school and his blaming of Hollywood films, video games, and popular music for school shootings such as the one in Connecticut.
