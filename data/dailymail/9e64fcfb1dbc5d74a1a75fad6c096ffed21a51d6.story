Residents of a Chicago suburb say their quiet city is being taken over by thousands of snakes that are finally emerging from hibernation after the long, bitter winter.

Dozens of slithering serpents have been spotted in parks, on sidewalks and yards in Naperville, Illinois.

One resident, Nancy Quigley, said she's found them on her door step and discovered six of them in her bushes in a matter of days.

Skin-crawling: This northern water snake was spotted near a river walk path in Naperville, Illinois - part of an influx of serpents in the city

Experts say the snakes, a gartner snake in a bush seen here, are harmless - but that doesn't stop residents from being unnerved by them

'They're twice as big as they were last year. They’re not afraid of me anymore,' she told WBBM-TV.

Naperville Animal Control says the serpents are harmless garter and water snakes.

There are four species of venomous snakes in Illinois, including two kind of a rattlesnake, but none of them have been found in the suburb west of Chicago.

They manage to freak residents out nonetheless. Like Mrs Quigley's deliveryman.

'He'll walk up to the house and see one, drop it and run,' she told WBBM.

'My friends said they're going to stop coming over.'

One resident created a meme for the problem - a play on the 2006 Samuel L. Jackson movie 'Snakes on a Plane'

The issue has become bad enough that someone even created a meme for it - playing off the 2006 Samuel L. Jackson movie 'Snakes on a Plane.'

David Drake, the snake expert at Aquarium Adventure in Chicago, told WBBM that the influx of snakes is simply a sign that they are finally emerging from their slumber and beginning their summer feeding frenzy.

Recent heavy rains are making them more visible by flooding them out of their homes, he added. 

Mr Drake said the snakes are nearly all harmless, but cautioned against approaching them unless they can be identified first - in the unlikely event that one turns out to be a venomous species.
