Tough decisions: George Osborne admitted that his plans to revive the economy have not made him popular

Chancellor George Osborne insisted his tough deficit reduction plan has been 'vindicated' despite fears that official figures due to be published on Tuesday will show a sharp slowdown in economic growth.

Britain has been turned into a 'safe harbour from the storm' he claimed at a London press conference ahead of their publication.

The Chancellor admitted the 'very difficult decisions' he has taken over the last year to revive the economy had not made him 'popular politically'.

But low interest rates and the UK's credit status meant they were 'justified', he added.

'That has provided the stability that the British economy needs in a very, very unstable global environment.'

The Office for National Statistics will tomorrow publish figures on the economy over the three months to June.

Previous forecasts of 0.5 per cent growth in GDP were predicted by city economists to drop to 0.1 per cent or 0.2 per cent.

The figure is subject to revision, but a poor reading would heap more pressure on Mr Osborne to come up with an alternative strategy to the Government's deficit reduction plan.

Asked if his tough economic policy, along with his involvement in the decision to hire Andy Coulson as Downing Street communications director, made him a 'reckless Chancellor', Mr Osborne replied: 'I think I am taking the right decisions that anyone in my position would have to take.

'I came into this job with Britain facing the largest budget deficit in the G20. There is no way you could massage those figures.

'We have just come out of the worst banking crisis, probably in British history, and we have had the deepest recession since the 1930s.

'We took a series of decisions early on to tackle the budget deficit and to have a credible plan in place.

'If you want evidence of why that was the right thing to do, look at the last couple of weeks.

'There are many European countries that in the last couple of weeks faced enormous instability because of question marks over their ability to pay their debts and deal with their budget deficits.

'But the UK, with a higher budget deficit than those countries, has not had that question mark over it.

'Indeed, our borrowing costs have come down. I think that is a vindication of the decisions we took. We turned Britain into a safe harbour from the storm. That has not been easy.'

Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron today poured cold water on hopes that tax cuts or a fresh round of money-printing may be deployed to stimulate the economy,

Business Secretary Vince Cable has suggested that the Bank of England could stimulate a sluggish economy with a further injection of money through so-called 'quantitative easing', while Chancellor George Osborne has hinted that he would like to cut taxes on business.

But Mr Cameron insisted that there was no leeway for either fiscal stimulus through tax cuts or public spending increases, or monetary stimulus in the form of the Bank reducing interest rates or printing money.

'There's no country, really, that can afford another fiscal stimulus. They've all run out of money,' he said.

'There isn't some great monetary stimulus you can give when interest rates are as low as they are.

'The right step for an economy like ours is to get on top of your debt and your deficit and then make it a better place for businesses to grow and expand and employ people.'

Speaking at a 10 Downing Street press conference with his Spanish counterpart Jose Luis Zapatero, Mr Cameron acknowledged that 'our path back to growth is a difficult one and has already been a difficult one'.

But he insisted: 'I'm confident we are taking the right steps to get on top of our debts and our deficit, to take Britain out of the danger zone in Europe, to get our economy moving.'
