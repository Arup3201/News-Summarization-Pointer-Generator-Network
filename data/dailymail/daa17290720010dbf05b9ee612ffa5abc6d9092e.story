It’s the multi-talented kitchen appliance which boasts thousands of loyal users around the world and now Australia’s Governor General wants one – but not everyone in the senate is clued-up on the Thermomix craze.

The Governor General’s office put out a tender for $80,000 - $100,000 worth of new kitchen equipment during a Senate hearing on Tuesday but Labor senator Joe Ludwig was left baffled by one pricey item on the list.

Senator Ludwig read through the request for kitchen appliances for Sir Peter Cosgroves’ two residences - Yarralumla in Canberra and Admiralty House in Sydney – saying: ‘You're seeking four stick blenders, two food processors... and you're going to have to help me with this - a Thermomix?’

‘I don't know what a Thermomix is,’ Senator Ludwig said.

Committee chair and South Australian senator Cory Bernardi ridiculed him, asking: ‘Where have you been?’

‘Queensland,’ Senator Ludwig responded. ‘A kitchen aid mixer, an upright freezer, a deep fryer and a pasta machine. And what's a Thermomix?,’ he continued.

The Governor General's official secretary, Mark Fraser, confessed: ‘I don't know what a Thermomix is.’

‘So there are a couple of us who don't know what a Thermomix is,’ Senator Ludwig announced.

Attempting to fill the Senate's Finance and Public Administration Committee in on the almost $2,000 kitchen toy, Senator Bernardi explained: ‘They're very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today.’

The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device has an almost cult-like following. They cannot be bought in stores, and shoppers hold 'Thermomix parties' similar to Tupperware parties where a Thermomix consultant comes out to a customer's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends. There are more than 3000 Thermomix consultants across Australia. 

‘Is that the elite trendies that use that, are they?’ asked Senator Ludwig.

South Australian senator Cory Bernardi described the Thermomix as 'very popular amongst the home masterchefs of today'

‘In Queensland, you may refer to them as that, I just refer to them as those who have a particular interest in cooking,’ Senator Bernardi retorted.

Noticing he’d touched a nerve, Senator Ludwig probed: ‘Is that the new model or the old model?’

'I'm no Masterchef myself all I know is that my team and with the expert advice of kitchen consultants have given us advice on the sorts of things our kitchen requires in order for it to function properly ' Mr Fraser said.

Senator Ludwig then took the opportunity to point out how much the Governor General’s office is spending elsewhere.

'You have $168,000 spent on redundancies, one involuntary, you have a request for a speechwriter and a media advisor… the previous Governor General managed not to require them.

‘And now you have a couple hundred thousand spent on that amount, plus an additional amount on kitchen appliances. You wonder where the priorities are,’ he said.

But Mr Fraser reasoned that they need the new kitchen appliances to maintain the ‘heritage properties’.

‘We're seeking to do so in the most efficient manner possible hence we're seeking to replace 14 kitchen items,’ he said.
