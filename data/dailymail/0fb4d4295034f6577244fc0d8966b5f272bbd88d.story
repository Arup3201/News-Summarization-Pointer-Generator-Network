An Indianapolis woman has been arrested for allegedly giving birth to a baby then dumping it in a bathroom trash can.

Briana Holland, 22, was questioned by Indianapolis detectives then arrested and taken into custody early on Saturday morning.

The investigation started the previous evening when police were called to a business facility in west Indianapolis.

Briana Holland, 22, was swiftly arrested and is facing one charge of neglect of a dependent

Police at the United Technology Carrier Corporation facility on Friday evening where the boy was found

After being contacted by employees at United Technology Carrier Corporation, they arrived to find a newborn baby boy inside the company's bathroom trash can.

Holland now is facing a preliminary charge of neglect after police said she gave birth to the unnamed boy at the facility and then abandoned him in the bin.

Police found the baby about 8pm that evening - thought to be only an hour after he was born. Holland was arrested by detectives at 5am the following morning and taken away for processing.

Police said the young boy is now in a good condition.

Although he was taken to Riley Hospital for Children in a critical condition, his health has improved and he is in the care of Department of Child Services staff.

The authorities were notified after staff at United Technology Carrier Corporation raised the alarm

Following the incident police reminded locals of the State of Indiana's safe-haven law.

Under the law, the parent, relative or adult responsible for a child can give up custody of a baby less than 30 days old - with no questions asked - and it will be taken into the custody of social services.

The goal of the law is to prevent incidents of abandonment such as that which occurred at the weekend.

As long as there is no evidence of abuse, no information is required of the person leaving the baby - which they can do at hospitals, police departments and even fire departments.
