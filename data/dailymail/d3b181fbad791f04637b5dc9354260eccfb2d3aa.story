The former Navy SEAL who has written an explosive book about his role in the assassination of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden has been warned he could face legal action from the Pentagon.

The Pentagon told the ex-SEAL - widely named as Team Six member Matt Bissonnette - his decision to write about the raid on bin Laden's Pakistan hideout put him in 'material breach' of non-disclosure agreements he signed with the Navy, even though he is no longer in the military.

It added that it is considering legal action against all those 'acting in concert' with the SEAL - who uses the pseudonym Mark Owen - on his book 'No Easy Day', which is due to be released on Tuesday.

Concealed identity: The former soldier was said to have been heavily disguised by make-up artists to film an interview with 60 Minutes about his book ahead of its release. It is set to air in the U.S. on September 9

The former soldier originally used the alias 
Mark Owen to protect his anonymity, but shortly after the book was announced he was identified by FoxNews.com as 36-year-old Matt Bissonnette.

A
letter penned by Jeh Johnson, general counsel for the U.S. Department of 
Defense, warned the former SEAL that disclosure of classified 
information 'constitutes a violation of federal criminal law'.

'In
the judgment of the Department of Defense, you are in material breach 
and violation of the non-disclosure agreements you signed,' the letter 
said.

'Further public dissemination of your book will aggravate your breach and violation of your agreements.'

Johnson said the Pentagon is considering pursuing 'all remedies legally available to us', according to ABC News.

The letter, which was addressed to the author's pseudonym, said the fact that 'Owen' signed two non-disclosure agreements in 2007 meant that he is under a continuing obligation to 'never divulge' classified information.

'This commitment remains in force even after you left the active duty Navy,; the letter said.

Johnson said that, in signing the agreements, the former SEAL had effectively given his assurance that he would 'submit any manuscript to the Pentagon for a security review, as well as obtain permission'.

'Owen' has previously said his book does not betray any sensitive information. The book's publisher has said it was vetted by a 'former special operations attorney'.Though the former SEAL said he will donate a majority of the book's profits to charities that help the families of fallen SEALs, the letter suggested that all of the book's royalties belong to the government.In signing his non-disclosure agreements, the former SEAL acknowledged he 'assigned to the U.S. government ... all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result from a disclosure, publication or revelation of classified information not consistent with the terms of this agreement', the letter said.

An interview the military man gave to 60 Minutes about his experience is also due to be aired next week.

Hollywood make-up artists were drafted in to heavily disguise the former SEAL when the interview was filmed, to protect his anonymity.

But the efforts would appear to have been a waste of time as the true identity of the former SEAL has been revealed.
