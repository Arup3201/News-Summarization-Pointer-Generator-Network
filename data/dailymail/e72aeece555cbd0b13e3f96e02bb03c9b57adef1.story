Universal benefits for pensioners could be cut after the next election, Iain Duncan Smith indicated yesterday.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes and TV licences will not be means tested until at least 2015 because the elderly need more time to prepare for a cut in the handouts.

And he insisted that the Tories will honour David Cameron’s pledge not to touch the benefits before the General Election.

Winter fuel allowance, TV licences and free bus passes could all become means tested for pensioners from 2015

‘We gave that clear commitment at the time of the last election,’ he said. ‘Pensioners need a much longer time if you are going to make changes to their income.

‘They are arguably the most difficult group to make short-term change because they can’t effect that change through any other means. They can’t suddenly say “I’ll take on more hours of work”.’

But Mr Duncan Smith’s choice of words puts him on a collision course with some of the Prime Minister’s closest advisers, who believe Mr Cameron will be damaged if he ever cuts the payments – even after 2015.

There is a growing political consensus that pensioners should be asked to contribute more to the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans having escaped the worst of the austerity measures.

Senior Liberal Democrats also spoke out yesterday, indicating that they will campaign to cut the payments to wealthy pensioners so that around £2billion that would be saved can be targeted at the least well off.

Research commissioned by Mr Cameron’s polling guru has found that a majority of the public back plans to cut the handouts for better off pensioners.

But the polling also found that he will suffer a ‘crisis of trust’ if he breaks his pledge and leave him reviled by voters as Nick Clegg was when he broke his promise never to raise university tuition fees.

That will dismay both Mr Duncan Smith and Chancellor George Osborne, who both privately regard the case for means testing pensioner benefits after 2015 as compelling.

Last year Nick Clegg also signalled that the Liberal Democrats will go their own way on the issue at the 2015 election.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he would be ‘looking again at universal benefits paid to the wealthiest pensioners’.

Ros Altmann, director-general of over-50s group Saga, said a raid on pensioner benefits would punish those who have saved for retirement.

Mr Duncan Smith’s spokesman said: ‘Iain made it very clear  that we have protected all the pensioner benefits for the whole of this Parliament and there are absolutely no plans to change that.’
