It is the happiest day of a couples life but can also be  one of the most expensive, seeing many people saving for years in order to afford their perfect wedding.

However one thrifty bride has proved that a magical matrimony needn't require draining your bank account or taking out a second mortgage.

Shelley Richmond, 30 from Terrington in Yorkshire created her dream day all for less than £4,000 which although is still a large amount of money it's a snip considering that last year the average wedding cost was £21,939.

Cheap and cheerful: Shelley and Paul's wedding cost just £3, 800

The scrimping bride made whopping savings by making her own wedding dress costing just £115 with shoes. She purchased her bridesmaids' dresses on Ebay with the cheapest costing just £7.

Incredibly, spendthrift Shelley spent just £600 feeding all 120 guests, working out at just £5 a head.

However, there was one area that Shelley wasn't prepared to scrimp on with her wedding drinks being her biggest set back. Her total bar bill was £1000 making sure her wedding went off with a bang.

Bargain bride: Shelley's wedding dress and shoes set her back just £115

Shelley's venue cost a bargain £400 making her total spend for her ideal wedding just £3,800.

For Shelley and her partner Paul, an lavish bash wasn't an option as the couple had just bought a house together so were running low on funds but they didn't want to cut corners on their special day.

She and Paul had been together eight years before getting engaged on holiday in Scotland in
 August last year.

'We were staying in our little camper van and had just been out for a meal at our favourite restaurant. Paul
 tricked me by saying he could see a pod of dolphins in the sea, but 
when I turned back round he was holding a beautiful shiny ring.'

Shelley who works as a painter and photographer, says that she was able to save so much by calling in favours from friends.

'The main way we cut down on costs was skill swapping, so my friend's band played the reception, and I'll be shooting their wedding photos, friends did the catering and I set them up a website for their new business.

'My dress I made from fabric bought through a wholesaler for around £75.

Creative saver: Shelley paid her waiters in booze in order to save on cash

Shelley was able to feed her entire wedding party for just £5 a head and made her own liqueur for the toasts

'I bought all my bridesmaid dresses on eBay or as samples from a friend who works in fashion, so they were free. The most expensive one was £7.'

Shelley saved further by getting creative, designing and making her own floral decorations rather than relying on a pricey florist.

'We picked flowers from a 
family friend's garden, just topping them up with a few from the 
supermarket. We all made our own bouquets and my bridesmaids did the buttonholes for the men too.'

Not-so-pricey party: Shelley's venue came in at a snip for just £400

Shelley and Paul couldn't afford an overindulgent wedding as the pair had just bought a house together

Despite having stretched to a slightly dearer bar bill, the bride still found ways to cut the costs when it came to drinks.

'I
 made flavoured liqueur for the toasts, served in shot glasses from 
charity shops. Everyone had a different glass which was lovely, but now 
I've got 120 shot glasses I don't know what to do with.' Say Shelley who even managed to sort cheap accommodation for her large group of guests.

'We had 120 
guests at the wedding who didn't have to pay for anything. We bought the
 alcohol at wholesale prices from a local supplier, then I arranged for 
everyone to be able to camp at the village hall to save them paying for a
 pricey hotel.'

Shelley's bridesmaids helped her create her budget wedding by skill-sharing

Shelley went for a vintage feel at her country wedding and the experience has inspired her to set up a money-saving crafty blog - Pretty Thrifty

Shelley even got creative when it came to means of paying seeing her waiters work for something other than tips.

'Our catering was done by our friend Kenny, and we used students for waiters - they will work for beer.'

For
 the dessert Shelley and Paul held a cake-making competition, which was 
so successful they still have cake in their freezer now.

Shelley says that no one would be able to tell it was a budget wedding unless they had already known

Shelley doesn't think that her wedding suffered at all despite her clever cost-cutting.

'I think unless you knew it was cheap, you wouldn't have guessed.'

The experience has even led Shelley to turn her skills and passion into a profession running her own blog called Pretty Thrifty where she shares DIY tutorials, money-saving tips and shares other budget weddings and common sense wedding planning advice.
