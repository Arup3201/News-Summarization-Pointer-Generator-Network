Jose Mourinho said it would be a ‘disgrace’ if Chelsea lost their FA Cup fourth round tie against Bradford on Saturday.

Chelsea have two cup games in four days, including the second leg of their League Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Tuesday, but the Blues manager insisted he would play strong teams despite resting John Terry, Thibaut Courtois and Diego Costa on Saturday. 

‘To help the title race the best thing is to lose against Bradford, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain (in the Champions League) and play only Premier League until the end of the season,’ said Mourinho.

Chelsea will host Bradford, who beat Millwall in the third round after a replay 

‘This is the perfect situation. But not with us, not with the Chelsea DNA.

‘The other day, a coach of a big team was knocked out of the Cup and he was saying, “Very good, now we can focus on other competitions”. If I lose against Bradford I won’t say that. I say, “It’s a disgrace”.’

Mourinho will select Andre Schurrle and Mohamed Salah but is not certain the in-demand pair will still be Chelsea players when the transfer window closes. He said a ‘phenomenal’ offer would be required for Schurrle.
