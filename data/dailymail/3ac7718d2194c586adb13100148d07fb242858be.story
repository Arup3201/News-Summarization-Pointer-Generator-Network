A Jewish rabbi and teacher at a girls’ seminary in Brooklyn was arrested Wednesday on child pornography charges after his wife turned him in.

Samuel Waldman, 52, was busted by feds after Homeland Security agents found him to be sharing at least three disturbing videos with children aged from four to 11-years-old engaging in sex acts, according to a criminal complaint.

A girl believed to be only four-years-old was shown performing oral sex on and having intercourse with adult men in one of the videos, and a nine-year-old boy was shown in another being fondled by an adult male, the complaint said.

‘Samuel Waldman’s position of trust in the community, as both a rabbi and a teacher, makes his alleged distribution of child pornography all the more disturbing,’ United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a press release.

The files were found November 1 on Waldman’s computer during a sting operation in which the feds downloaded the files from him using a peer-to-peer file sharing program, authorities said.

This allowed them to trace the sickening files back to his home using his IP address, they said. An IP address is the unique identifier by which each computer connects to the internet, no two are the same.

Investigators visited the man’s home Monday and spoke to his wife, that conversation led to Wednesday’s raid.

Officials did not find the videos previously downloaded, but did find enough evidence to place him under arrest.

They also confiscated his computer, according to WPIX.

The affidavit also states that Waldman admitted to downloading, viewing and sharing child pornography for years, something he declined in multiple interviews.

‘[It’s] false, specifically the way they are describing the distribution and dissemination,’ he told the New York Post. ‘It’s absolutely being misconstrued completely, 100%, and we will fight that to the end.’

‘I’ll have my time in court,’ he told News 12 in a bizarre interview that saw him pacing up and down his Brooklyn street trying to avoid the camera.

‘Some people have created a story, [I] did not admit,’ he continued. ‘They can say whatever they want.’

When pressed by the Post as to whether or not he viewed the videos, he replied ‘that I’m not going into right now.’

Waldman is a teacher at the Beth Jacob Teachers Seminary, only blocks from his home.

A person who answered the phone at the school refused comment and promptly hung up when reached by MailOnline.

It is not known which classes he teachers, or the ages of his students.

The rabbi was charged with one count of transporting or distributing child pornography, and faces between five and 20 years in prison if convicted. He was also ordered to have no unsupervised contact with children and no employment with access to children.

He was released on $100,000 bail, it is not clear when he is due again in court.
