Romain Grosjean is on the brink of being confirmed as a Lotus driver for 2015.

Earlier this season Lotus confirmed Pastor Maldonado would remain with the Enstone-based marque for a second campaign.

Grosjean, however, opted to bide his time to see what plans Lotus had in the pipeline to right the wrongs of a wretched campaign or whether other options would become available.

With Lotus recently confirming a switch from Renault power units to the all-conquering Mercedes, that has played a key role in Grosjean's thinking, with a new deal close for the Frenchman.

Team principal Federico Gastaldi said: 'Romain is in pole position...and honestly it's a case of us finalising a few details.

'We expect to have an announcement very shortly.

'Like the technical package confirmation there has been a lot going on in the offices at Enstone, as well as the pits and paddock.

'It is all looking very good and exciting for the team going forwards.'

Believing Mercedes will play a key role in Lotus' revival, Gastaldi added: 'Obviously it was something that was in the pipeline.

'Behind the scenes we realised it was time for a new direction and we are very happy we can finally confirm this publically.

Lotus' other driver Pastor Maldonado has already confirmed he will be with the marque next season

'Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains have already made a positive impression and we believe they will be a key ingredient for future success.

'It has become obvious this year that they have the most competitive package on the engine side.

'Their strengths, allied to ours, will form a potent combination in 2015 and create a special hybrid package.'
