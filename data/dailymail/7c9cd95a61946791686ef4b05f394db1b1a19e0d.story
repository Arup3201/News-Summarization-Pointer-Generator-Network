British plans to set up new military bases in the Middle East as part of a strategy to tackle the threat posed by Islamic State extremists are currently being considered, it has been reported.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Bahrain are all being looked at as part of the Government's attempts to contain the terror threat from the wider region, according to The Times.

Officials have said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is 'currently looking at its future engagement in the region', but no decisions have been made.

According to The Times report, Downing Street has been expected to make an announcement for some months.  

The al-Minhad airbase near Dubai is already used by troops flying in and out of Afghanistan.

A defence source told the newspaper: 'You could see an infantry battalion based in al-Minhad, being able to train alongside the Emirates.'

It is understood that work began before the rise of Islamic State and is part of a review of the UK's presence in the Gulf following the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.

Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, said there had been a shift toward such a move over the last two years.

He told The Times: 'The effect is that we are making a strategic adjustment, which is in my view quite sensible.

'But it is not something that I think has come from Downing Street. This has come through the armed forces working it out.'

An MoD spokesman said: 'The British military has maintained a constant presence in the Middle East since the 1980s and our armed forces routinely exercise with members of the Gulf Co-operation Council.

'The MoD is currently looking at its future engagement in the region including options for our military presence in the Gulf; this work is still in development and no final decisions have yet been made.'
