Lindsay Lohan has been ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service for a reckless driving charge - after she tried to pass off time on stage in London as volunteering.

The 28-year-old actress had previously been ordered to perform 240 hours of community service as part of a plea deal she struck after her Porsche rear-ended a truck in California in 2012.

But while appearing in the West End production 'Speed The Plow' last year, she let young people 'shadow' her and logged it as community hours.

The court 'had a problem with some of the work shadowing,' Lohan's attorney, Shawn Holley, told the Los Angeles Times. 'They didn't want to hear more about how that played out.' 

Back to work: Lindsay Lohan, pictured in London this week, has been ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service for a reckless driving charge after she failed to complete her service appropriately

The ruling means that rather than finish her probation in March as planned, Lohan faces another three months of community service - but her attorney said she has no problem with it.  

'She's enjoying doing community service,' Holley told the LA Times. 'Her passion is really working with kids... and kids really respond to her.'

The judge made the decision in private and a hearing will now be held on March 12 to decide how the actress is to complete her community service.  

After Lohan had been ordered to carry out 240 hours of court-ordered community service, she vowed to complete it at the London-based charity Community Service Volunteers (CSV).

But according to tmz, prosecutor Terry White examined the hours she spent at the organisation and had planned to tell the judge she had violated her probation. 

On stage: Lohan (with Richard Schiff as film boss Bobby Gould) starred as a secretary in 'Speed The Plow' by David Mamet at the Playhouse Theatre in London - and tried to claim the hours for community service

On one occasion, the actress was given six hours credit but two of those hours were for a matinee performance of Speed The Plow, a further two were for an evening performance while two more hours were taken up with a meet-and-greet event afterwards, White reportedly found. 

Miss Lohan arrived in London last autumn to star in a West End production of David Mamet's play, the movie business satire Speed The Plow. She played a forthright secretary in the production at London's Playhouse Theatre.

Mr White told The Mail on Sunday that a prison sentence would not be ruled out for Miss Lohan if she is found in breach of her probation terms. 

On Sunday, CSV chief executive Oonagh Aitken said the organisation took its 'responsibilities in relation to all kinds of volunteering with great seriousness'.
