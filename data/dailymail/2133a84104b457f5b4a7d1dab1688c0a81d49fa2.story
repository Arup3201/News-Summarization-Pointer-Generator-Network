Jailed: Nathanial Teague was sentenced to more than three years after killing an 80-year-old widow

A car thief who killed an 80-year-old widow in a hit-and-run has been jailed for more than three years. 

Unqualified driver Nathanial Teague, 26, ploughed into pensioner Alice Lucas at 60mph on a pedestrian crossing after stealing his ex-girlfriend's Vauxhall Astra. 

Her frail body was catapulted four metres in the air and landed on a grass verge - about 25 metres from where she was hit.

Teague then desperately tried to drive away but smashed his vehicle into another car. 

He managed to steer the wreckage away from the scene on the A45 Coventry Road in Yardley, Birmingham, and dumped the car at his former partner's house in Solihull, West Midlands. 

Despite attempts to save Mrs Lucas, she died at the scene from her injuries.

Teague handed himself in to police later that evening on Saturday, February 16.

He was charged with causing death by dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking, failing to stop after an accident and driving without a license and no insurance. 

Teague, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to all charges at an earlier magistrates court hearing.

He was sentenced to three years and four months in prison at Birmingham Crown Court.

Jailing Teague, Judge Michael Chambers QC told him: 'This death was tragic and unnecessary.

'The impact on those nearest to her must be enormous. The visibility and weather conditions were good.

'You should have been able to see her had you been travelling at the proper speed and keeping a proper lookout.'

He was also banned from the roads for three years.

After the case PC Stuart Thorpe, from West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a tragic case where an elderly lady has lost her life and a family has been left devastated by a moment of dangerous driving.

'Thankfully, the person responsible has saved the family the time and pain of enduring a lengthy court process, and he has admitted all of his actions which culminated in Mrs Lucas' death. 

'We hope that the family can now take some comfort from this sentence.'
