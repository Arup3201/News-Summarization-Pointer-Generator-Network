Richard Engel, the chief foreign news correspondent for NBC News, revealed the psychological torture he and his crew endured in captivity after they were abducted at the Syrian border last week.

Speaking with the TODAY show’s Savannah Guthrie, Engel and his crew said that each of them thought every one of the five days they spent in captivity would be their last.

They also spoke of the horrors put on them by their captors, saying that they were routinely blindfolded, handcuffed, and lined up execution style to the sounds of guns being loaded.

Engel said it was a tactic. ‘They don’t want you to be strong,’ he said. ‘They would blindfold you. They line you up against the wall, you hear weapons loading and unloading, you hear plastic wrap. Then they leave you there for 30 minutes. And that was happening every day.’

Engel and his crew, including producers Ghazi Balkiz and Aziz Akyavas, as well as cameraman John Kooistra were seasoned in covert reporting in the war-ravaged country, but were taken hostage in Syria earlier this month by an unknown group.

NBC News reported that they received no calls demanding ransoms for the crew.

Engel said that the reporting embargo in place in America was likely what kept them safe and alive. ‘Everyone at NBC did everything to keep it quiet, it was very important to us,’ he explained on 'Rock Center.'

‘The kidnappers didn’t know very much about us – the less they knew, the safer we were.’

None of the crew was hurt when they were abducted, though they killed one of the rebels who had been travelling with the NBC News crew, the New York Times reported.

No single group has taken responsibility for the abduction.

The crew was believed to have been taken near Ma-arrat Misrin, and were pictured in captivity with Arabic sprayed on the wall which read: ‘Or will burn.’

Engel said that he and his crew were kept apart from one another and were often blindfolded. ‘There is a tactic involved,’ he told Guthrie. ‘They knew that they were doing.

'They knew how to play nice and play evil within minutes of each other.’

'You try to push the bad thoughts away. You know you have to stay strong.'

As an example, the 39-year-old correspondent said that one minute, their captors were giving them tea, and the next, they were demanding the crew decide who would be killed first.

But, they said, it was clear that their captors never intended to kill them. ‘They clearly wanted us as hostages, (and) they were violent.’

He said that he kept himself positive by thinking of a meal he would have when he was released, visualizing every step from setting the table to washing the dishes.

'You try to push bad thoughts away. You know you have to stay strong,' he said.

'Then you’re having a second conversation where I say – I need to escape.'

When Engel’s last report aired from Aleppo, he was already in captivity, where he would remain for the next five days. He and his crew had to cross into Turkey so as to broadcast from a safe location.

They were freed as their captors passed a rebel checkpoint run by Syrian rebels on Monday, and then released to Turkey. 

Following his release, Engel told Turkish media that he would 'rather forget' the ordeal. He added to the Turkish news agency Anadolu that he and his team were 'very happy to be out' but 'very tired.'

After his release, Akyavas told Turkish news station NTV that they had guns pointed on their heads ‘every now and then.’

‘It was not pleasant,’ he added.

Following the release of cameraman Ian Rivers, NBC News president Steve Capus released a statement saying that everyone at the company ‘can breathe a huge sigh of relief and express our deep appreciation to all who helped secure their freedom.’

He continued: ‘At the same time, our thoughts and concerns are with those who remain missing inside Syria and we hope for their swift and safe release.’

Engel, 39, offered his thanks on Twitter yesterday, writing: ‘Thank you for all the support, prayers and kind thoughts. We’re out. Free. Happy and safe.’ 

Speaking with the Today 
show on Tuesday morning, the day after their release, the men recounted how they were led blindfolded
 from room to room and had no idea what would happen to them.

'You
 think that are going to take you outside to execute you,' Engel said. 
'We weren't physically beaten or tortured. It was a lot of psychological
 torture, threats of being killed.

Safe: Engel said he stayed strong by picturing a meal he'd eat once freed and how he would prepare it

'They
 made us choose which one of us would be shot first and when we refused 
there were mock shootings. They pretended to shoot Ghazi [Balkiz, an NBC
 producer] several times.'

Cameraman
 John Kooistra, who was also captured, added: 'I made amends with my 
maker. I made good with my maker. I made good with 
myself. I was prepared to die many times.'

But amid their fear, they worked together to stay positive, Engel said.

'We weren't allowed to speak but if 
you peek underneath the blindfold, you can see if there's a guard in the
 room,' he said. 'We tried to joke around a little. We passed messages 
to each other.'

Engel,
 who is divorced and doesn't have children, was promoted to NBC News's 
chief foreign correspondent in 2008.

He runs NBC’s Middle East bureau 
and has been reporting on the ongoing conflict between rebels and forces
 backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Engel
 is widely regarded for his coverage of wars, revolutions and political 
transitions around the world over the last 15 years, including his coverage of last year's Arab Spring.
