Lives are at risk because of a desperate shortage of MRI scanners in the NHS to diagnose cancer, an international report has found.

In a bitter irony, it was UK scientists who were instrumental in inventing the scanners which are now credited with saving lives throughout the world.

Yet we have fewer of them than almost all other Western countries – and even developing countries such as Turkey and former Communist states such as Slovakia.

Short supply:Picture posed by models. The UK has fewer scanners than almost all other Western countries - and even developing countries such as Turkey and former Communist states such as Slovakia

Out of the 32 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which represents industrialised nations, the UK stands 26th.

Our record is even worse on CT scanners – also invented by British scientists – on which we stand 30th out of 32. Only Hungary and Mexico are below us.

The figures come weeks after it was revealed suspected cancer sufferers are waiting longer for diagnosis on the NHS, reducing their chances of recovery.

The NHS recommends no one should wait longer than six weeks for a diagnostic test.

But in April, almost 17,000 patients waited longer – more than double the total in the same month last year and the highest for six years.

Some 2,439 waited too long for MRI scans, compared with 374 at the time of the last election in 2010; with 859 waiting too long for CT scans, compared with 215 in 2010.

Despite billions being pumped into the NHS in recent years, Britain’s record on cancer survival is still among the worst in Europe.

British scientists are credited with developing the cancer-detecting scanners which are now more prevalent around the world than they are here.

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) uses magnetism to build a picture of inside the body, while CT (computed tomography) uses radiation.

MRI is best for diagnosing tumours in the brain, bones and soft tissues.

For other cancers, doctors may call for a CT scan.

The first commercially viable CT scanner was invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield in London, where the first brain scan in the world was carried out on October 1, 1971.

Meanwhile, a team led by Scottish professor John Mallard built the first full-body MRI scanner in Aberdeen.

On August 28 1980 it obtained the first clinically useful image of a patient’s internal tissues, identifying a tumour.

Last week it emerged that, despite not having the money for cancer scanners, tens of millions are spent a year on cosmetic surgery.

Mike Hobday, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘This report suggests we are at a further disadvantage.’

Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s not surprising we can’t afford modern equipment, after we negotiated a contract that enhanced doctors’ pay to such a degree all funds go on staff costs.’

The OECD figures come in its Health At A Glance 2013 report, which warned: ‘If there are too few [MRI and CT] units, this may lead to access problems in terms of geographic proximity or waiting times.’

The report shows the UK has only 5.9 MRI units per million people, less than half the OECD average of 13.3.

This is dramatically below the 23.7 in Italy and 46.9 in Japan – one of the countries with the longest life expectancy.

Even in Turkey there are 10.5 MRI scanners per million.

Britain’s ranking of 26th out of 32 is below Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Portugal. Only Australia, Poland, Chile, Hungary, Israel and Mexico are below us.

On CT scanners we are 30th out of 32 countries, in front of only Hungary and Mexico. The numbers concern only NHS scanners.

NHS England said: ‘The situation over the last few years has improved in terms of numbers of machines and an increase in the trained work force.’
