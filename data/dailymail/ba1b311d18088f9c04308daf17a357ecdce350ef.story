When home owner Howard Hudson moved in next door to a plastic recycling centre he thought he had found tidy and environmentally-friendly neighbours.

But the frustrated resident has instead found himself living next to a growing rubbish dump that now towers 20 feet high at the back of his garden.

Cafe boss Mr Hudson, 57, moved into his 
£70,000 terraced house ten years ago not realising bosses at the recycling depot 
were about to expand.

But now hundreds of tonnes of plastic scrap are piled up 20 feet high behind his back wall in Blackburn, Lancashire.

Mr Hudson is now urging for action from local councillors and the Environment Agency against officials at V10 Polymers.

He said: 'When people are driving past they think 
it is a tip - but it’s not, it’s a plastic recycling centre. But I’m not
surprised people think that it is a tip because it looks like a dumping
ground.

Frustrated: Mr Hudson says the expansion of the recycling plant has made his life a misery

'It is an absolute disgrace - it looks really awful and can’t carry on living like this.

'It used to be quiet and tidy here but not now. This is the mess that I see over my back yard wall and every morning through the bedroom window.

'Since the company has grown, residents around here have been left with noisy wagons and this eyesore. We are going to start a petition and send it to the council. I was hoping to emigrate to Gambia next year but I will never be able to sell the house.

'My son is in the building trade and he said the house has devalued by £20,000. The council needs to do something. When I moved in it was not like this. I just don’t know what to do because it’s really getting me down.'

Mr Hudson has also raised concerns about the health risks posed by the rat infested tower of rubbish.

He added: 'There are rats everywhere and I’ve even had to get two cats because we were getting so many of them.

'It is only a metre away from my back
yard. We have seen rats running about all over, you wouldn’t believe 
the amount the cats kill.

'This is meant to be a plastic recycling centre but I don’t see much recycling going on.

'Some say its like an ocean of plastic but I would say it was worse than that - it’s like a tidal wave when you look out at it.

'Even the environmental health said that it was bad and he said that in his eyes it was illegal but they’ve said what is happening is not illegal.'

Mr Hudson said the problems started when a factory was torn down on the site and replaced with the dump.

He said: 'When I moved in 10 years ago it was 
summer and everything was flowering and I had a reasonable view looking 
out over the factory and it was fine - but not anymore.

'They found asbestos in the roof and demolished it and this started piling up. If the factory was still there it wouldn’t be like this. They wouldn’t be able to pile all this stuff up in a factory.

Campaign: Mr Hudson is now asking his local council and the Environment Agency to take action against V10 Polymers

'There was a wall behind my yard which 
went straight across but they demolished that, I had to stop them 
demolishing the wall in front otherwise the rubbish would have been up 
to my back yard.

'I kept thinking that something would be done about it because it was getting out of hand but nothing was ever done about it.

'In winter when all the leaves have fallen and there aren’t my roses and clematis it looks really bare and all you can see is that eyesore.

'I can’t get out because no one will want to buy the house and have this in their back yard. It just seems to be getting worse. I can’t win and it’s so frustrating.

'I don’t look out of my window anymore I’m at my wits end. I have blinds so I can’t see out at that eyesore.'

Neighbour Diane Hargreaves said: 'I knew V10 was there when I moved in, but cannot believe how bad it is.

'The view is dreadful and the noise from lorries, especially in the morning is terrible. I want the company or the council to do something about it. Even a wall or screen between us and the recycling site would be an improvement.'

V10 Polymers which handles in excess of 5,000 tonnes of plastic scrap per year has been operating legally at the site for many years and is not controvening any planning rules. It said its recycling operations met Environment Agency and borough requirements.

Manager David Holt said: 'We have controlled facilities for our waste and the items that we recycle disposed of accordingly. And as for the rats we are situated right next to the canal.'

Regenerating: Mr Hudson's property is located within the Waterside regeneration area in Blackburn, Lancashire
