A gambling-addicted father hacked his pregnant wife and two children to death to save them from torture by loan sharks, police believe.

Tunde Keri, 36, and sons Toni, five, and Rafael, 18 months, were found dead at the family home in Val-de-Marne, near Paris, after worried relatives could not contact her on her phone.

Construction worker Florin Sebastian Balan, 38, who had moved to France from Romania with his family in 2012, was later arrested and allegedly told police his family were threatened by loan sharks.

Dead: Tunde Keri (centre), 36, was found dead at the family home in Val-de-Marne, near Paris, with her sons

Both children were found with their throats cut, while seven-months-pregnant Mrs Keri suffered multiple chest and neck wounds.

Police began the probe after being tipped off by the woman's sister and brother-in-law in Romania.

Killed: Pregnant Mrs Keri was stabbed to death

Police
 spokesman Luc Poignant said: ‘Because she was seven months pregnant, 
the brother-in-law at first thought they could have gone to the 
hospital.

‘It was not until late in the evening that he began to worry because nobody was answering their phones.’

Now police have allegedly discovered that Mr Balan owed up to £30,000 to loan sharks and lived in terror of them kidnapping his family.

One unnamed relative in Romania said: ‘He was addicted to gambling but he always lost and he always borrowed more.

‘In the end I understand he was borrowing from very serious, very violent criminals and he had been warned they would torture his wife and family if he didn't pay.

‘He was obviously not in his right mind. Maybe he was trying to put them beyond their reach.’

Police allegedly discovered that €10,000 (£8,000) in a bank account in his elder son's name had been emptied recently.

But Mrs Keri’s family in Oradea, a city in western Romania, said they had no idea of the danger she was in.

Mother Rozalia Keri said: ‘They were married for 16 years. She never said they don't get along.’
