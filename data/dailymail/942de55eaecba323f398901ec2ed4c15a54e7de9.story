Relentless Robbie Neilson  celebrated Hearts clinching the Championship title in March — then ordered his team to smash Hibs’ second-tier record points total.

An unexpected 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road yesterday left the Tynecastle side — who had beaten Falkirk 3-0 at Westfield 24 hours earlier — an unassailable 23 points clear of Hibs with 21 points left on the board.

Neilson learned his team had secured a return to the Premiership without kicking a ball while he was studying for his pro licence at Stirling University yesterday afternoon.

But, despite the league being finally in the bag, the 34-year-old vowed there will be no let-up as Hearts hope to usurp Hibs’ record tally of 89 points, set under Alex McLeish in 1999.

Should his team rise to his challenge of winning their remaining seven matches, the rampant Gorgie outfit would end the season with a remarkable 99 points.

‘It’s a fantastic achievement to win the league. It’s a great day for the club,’ said Neilson. ‘The objective for the season was to get promoted. We’ve done that and that will give us a head start in planning for next season — but we need to keep winning games.

‘We’ve got seven games left and we want maximum points. We won’t be losing focus. If we could set a new record for points for the division, then that would be fantastic.

‘When you play for a club with the stature of Hearts, you have to keep winning games — and that’s what we need to do.

‘I will rotate the squad and some guys will get game time but you have to win games. We can’t be turning up at venues and losing games. We want to win, starting with three more points against Queen of the South at Tynecastle next weekend.’

Neilson believes his side’s 2-1 stoppage-time win at Ibrox against Rangers on the opening day of the season set the tone for a fine campaign. But it wasn’t until a battling 2-1 victory at Queen of the South on February 21 that he truly believed his side was destined to win the league and return to the top flight after one season away.

‘I don’t think you ever take things for granted until you are over the line,’ he said.

‘But I think that Queen of the South game was a big one for us away from home. We went a goal behind and we had to fight back to get all three points. We eventually got there and, from then on, I thought we had a real chance of taking the league.

‘But that win against Rangers on the opening day was a huge one for us in terms of morale and also for our fans. A lot of times you can go to Ibrox, go ahead and then Rangers draw level and you’re then hoping to hang on for a draw.

‘But we went straight up the park and scored again to get all three points and that set the tone for the whole season. It gave us a real belief we could go on to win the trophy and now we’ve done it.

‘To finally get over the line is magnificent. The players have worked so hard and I couldn’t have asked for more.

‘We can now speak to players we want to get from outside the club and speak to players at the club and try to renegotiate. We’ve got guys who have been fantastic for us and we want to keep hold of them.

‘It’s just a great day and it’s testament to the support we’ve had all season from the fans, the hard work of (owner) Ann Budge and (director of football) Craig Levein and all the players.

‘The fans in particular have been magnificent and they deserve to have a great night and a great few weeks.’

Meanwhile, Hearts captain Danny Wilson admitted it was a relief to finally get over the line after months of being billed as champions-in-waiting.

‘It has been difficult, you know,’ he said. ‘Since maybe late December and early January people have had us installed as champions. So it’s been tough, not so much to keep your standards up but to put all that talk to one side. But we’ve done that.

‘The way the season has panned out, we’ve been going about our business in the right fashion. But if you had asked me at the start of the season whether I thought the gap would have been this big, I probably wouldn’t have believed you.’
