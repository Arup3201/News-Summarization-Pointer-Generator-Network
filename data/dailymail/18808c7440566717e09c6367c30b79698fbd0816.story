They say that pets can communicate with their owners and this is one tale that really proves it. 

Family cat Tiger has been hailed a hero after the 19-year-old moggie alerted his owners to a serious house fire in their Gold Coast home which could have claimed their lives.

Tiger's owner Peter Byrne, 68, told Channel 9 that the cat woke him up about 4.30am on Friday.

A bit shy: Family cat Tiger alerted the family to the blaze before smoke alarms sounded

The Elanora home-owner was woken up at 4.30am by the cat when he went 'yowling around the house' 

He said: 'He was yowling around the house and running around the house inside, and there was no sign of smoke but he knew something wasn't right.'

Tiger had good timing because the blaze spread so quickly that the house soon collapsed. 

Todd Murray, from Queensland Fire and Rescue, told Channel 9: 'The house was completely damaged, the roof has fallen in, some of the walls have even fallen which is compounding our ability to get water onto the fire to extinguish it.' 

It took fire crews four hours to get the blaze under control and two firefighters were injured fighting the blaze and taken to hospital as a precautionary measure. 

The house was totally destroyed in the intense blaze which engulfed the Gold Coast home 

Todd Murray, from Queensland Fire and Rescue, told Channel 9: 'The house was completely damaged, the roof has fallen in, some of the walls have even fallen' 

Mr Byrne said: 'I might have been part of that collateral damage'

Neighbour John Garland added: 'There were flames coming out of windows, flames coming out of side windows' 

Mr Byrne told Channel 9: 'If he hadn't woken me up I might have been part of that collateral damage too.' 

Neighbour John Garland added: 'There were flames coming out of windows, flames coming out of side windows.' 

Mr Bryne added: 'He (Tiger) has repaid us many times over, you can't underestimate the loyalty of animals.
