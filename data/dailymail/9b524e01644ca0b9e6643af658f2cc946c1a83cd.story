Paedophile: Michael Jackson abducted, tied up and sexually assaulted a 10-year-old boy

A convicted paedophile snatched a boy of ten off the street in broad daylight with the warning: ‘If you scream, I’m gonna kill ya.’

Former pirate radio DJ Michael Jackson watched the boy walk past his apartment to a shop to buy a fizzy drink, then lay in wait for him to return.

After grabbing him from behind and warning him he would die if he did not keep quiet, Jackson marched the boy back to his housing association flat, bound him with rope and duct-tape and shoved him into an airing cupboard with a pillow case over his head.

Jackson, 50, is then said to have groped the boy, repeatedly threatening to kill him if he made a noise.

The terrified child was found more than three hours later – naked from the waist down and begging for help – after he managed to free some of his bonds to shuffle to a window when Jackson went out.

He was seen by a family friend who had been helping to search for him, and told them: ‘I’ve been kidnapped, the man’s gone and left me.’

Twice-married Jackson was arrested later that day at the home of a friend where he had gone to play computer games.

Police believe he had left his flat in Oldbury, West Midlands – which was run by a housing association which works to help resettle  ex-offenders – to build himself an alibi with the intention of returning later to molest the boy.

Just four days before the kidnap last November, Jackson had failed in an attempt to snatch the same child, who lived 250 yards from his flat, chasing him to his front door.

While police were investigating the second incident, a ten-year-old girl came forward to reveal how two months earlier, Jackson had lured her to his flat to look at his goldfish and, under the pretext of a ‘cops and robbers game’, tied her up before photographing her.

Although no sexual assault took place, prosecutors believe Jackson’s motives had been sexual.Jackson, who has at least one grown-up child, has a criminal history stretching back to 1976 with 20 convictions for 73 offences.

Although most are dishonesty offences
such as fraud, theft or burglary, they include two similar sexual 
assaults from the early 1980s.

In 1981 he was given a two-year probation
order after taking a woman off the street to a secluded building and 
molesting her.

In 1983, he lured a 13-year-old girl 
into his tower block flat with the offer of stroking his puppy before 
grabbing her at knifepoint, bolting the door and tying her up with her 
own roller boot laces.

Jackson was then known as Albert 
English – he later changed his name to impress his second wife, who was a
fan of pop star Michael Jackson – and living in Smethwick, three miles 
from Oldbury.

He stripped and gagged the girl before simulating sex and forcing her to touch him.

Later that year he was sentenced to 30 months for kidnap, indecent assault and breach of his probation order.

Last night, his victim told the Daily Mail: ‘I was petrified. He kept me there for seven hours.

‘I swear the only reason I got out of
there alive was by promising to be his girlfriend for the rest of my 
life. I told him I’d go back to visit him the next day. Eventually he 
let me go.’

Coincidentally, the woman  lives just streets away from the boy who was snatched in the most recent attack.

She added: ‘My mum had a sick feeling
that whoever kidnapped that boy was also my attacker. She thought she’d
seen him on his bike around here not so long ago.

‘Jackson shouldn’t have been allowed 
to live anywhere near me. Just like that little boy, I’m lucky to be 
here to tell the tale.’

At court in May, Jackson admitted 
abducting the ten-year-old girl, as well as kidnapping, falsely 
imprisoning and sexually assaulting the boy, along with kidnap with 
intent to commit a sexual offence.

But reporting restrictions prevented 
his identification until the conclusion of a trial over the alleged 
kidnap and indecent assault of another woman.

The restrictions were 
lifted yesterday after the prosecution decided not to proceed with that 
case.

Jackson, who will be sentenced later this month, was arrested last November after the boy was found at his ground-floor flat

At Wolverhampton Crown Court, Judge 
Nicholas Webb adjourned sentencing over the offences against the two 
ten-year-olds until later this month.

Barristers said the judge could 
decide to hand Jackson an indeterminate sentence for public protection –
meaning he would be released only if he was considered to pose no 
further threat.

Last night, Detective Chief Inspector
Gary Booth, who led the police investigation, said Jackson was a 
‘dangerous offender’, adding that his actions had had a ‘massive impact’
on the two ten-year-olds.

A spokesman for Adullam Homes, which 
runs the block where Jackson was living, said it had been closed and was
being sold to another housing association.
