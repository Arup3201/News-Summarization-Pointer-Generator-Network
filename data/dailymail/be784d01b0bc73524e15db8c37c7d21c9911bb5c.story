Despite their six-figure salaries and sponsorship deals, there continues to be a financial health epidemic among athletes, with 60 per cent of NBA players declaring bankruptcy within five years of retiring.

But one newcomer is breaking the money mold by locking away his millions in a trust that cannot be accessed for three years.

Michael Carter-Williams, a rookie NBA player for the Philadelphia 76ers, is being lauded for his financial maturity.

The 22-year-old is guaranteed $4.5 million over his first seasons, but has chosen to live off his endorsement deals with Nike and Panini trading cards, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Clever boy: With the help of his mother, 22-year-old Michael Carter Williams has put most of his $4.5 million salary in a trust for three years to preserve his wealth

'With rookie contracts capped in the NFL and NBA, the ultimate financial success of many careers are determined by the second pro contract,' said Matt Dzamba, director of sports marketing at Zambezi.

'Protecting the first contract by essentially locking it up takes a lot of pressure off the player both on and off the court.'

Carter-Williams, from the Boston suburb of Hamilton, Mass., has his mother, Mandy Carter-Zegarowski and her best friend running his management team.

'Our goal is to work with Michael to manage his money in a way that will secure his long-term financial future,' Carter-Zegarowski said in a statement provided to ABC News.

'Right now, the focus is not only to save as much as possible, but also to use his unique position to serve as a role model and give back to the communities that continue to support him and his career.'

'They are taking a proactive approach to make sure he doesn't spend all his money in a couple of years,' writes Keith Pompey, staff writer for the Inquirer.

Carter-Williams was drafted 11th overall in the 2013 NBA Draft.

The type of trust he has chosen is not known, however financial advisers say it is a strange move, with such accounts usually set up by people with children.

It's a move that should have perhaps been taken by one of the most famous 76ers, Allen Iverson.

Arguably the most famous Philadelphia 76ers player, Allen Iverson, had a wealth hovering around an estimated $200 million, but was forced to admit he was broke after failing to pay child support

First drafted by the 76ers in 1996, Allen Iverson was marred by child support issues, divorce settlement entanglements, debts to jewelers and attorneys, alleged gambling and alcohol addictions, and property foreclosures

A 'Sixer' from 1996 to 2006 then 2009 to 2010, Iverson said this year that he is broke and can't pay child support.

The ex-wife of the 36-year-old former Georgetown University player demanded that he put over a million dollars into a trust fund for child support.

The stories of young celebrities going broke or owing money to the IRS are not new.

In October, singer Aaron Carter, 25, the younger brother of Backstreet Boys member Nick, filed for bankruptcy.

The travails of Lindsay Lohan, 27, and her courtroom drama often involved her need to support her family financially.

'Even if an athlete has a million dollars today, it has to last until you're 65,' said tax expert and attorney Kelly Phillips Erb.

Phillips Erb said her 'gut' was that Carter-Williams and his parents created the trust to protect his money from himself.

Financial ruin is hardly exclusive to athletes, with many celebrities often going broke. Sometime singer Aaron Carter filed for bankruptcy in October

A self-settled trust would have certain protections but would have to have been blessed by a court, she said.

A standard irrevocable trust is typically created for estate planning purposes. These can be broken but there would be tax consequences.

'In professional sports in particular, you're going to have health problems and your knees are going to go out,' she said.

'His parents are very smart to know he has a shelf life though they hope he'll go on to good things.

'But they don't want him to blow his money on a Lamborghini.'
