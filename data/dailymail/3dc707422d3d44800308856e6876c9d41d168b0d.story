Apology: Britain's Got Talent contestant Reece Davis-James wrote an apology for his actions but was still jailed

A Britain’s Got Talent dancer who reached the semi-final this year has been jailed for looting in the London riots, despite a judge commending him for a letter of apology.

Reece Davis-James, 18, was part of the street dance crew Abyss on the hit ITV1 show.

But just a few months after his on screen success, Reece was arrested on August 8 during rioting in Catford, south-east London, and has now been sentenced to 14 months in prison.

He pleaded guilty at an earlier court hearing to burglary after admitting stealing a £150 stereo from an Argos store.

District Judge Ian Baker said he was considering a suspended sentence because he was impressed by Reece's letter, which told him he was teaching dance for free to make amends for his behaviour.

Reece, who lives in Catford with his unemployed mother, claimed he was 'a bystander that got caught up in the heat of the moment’ and promised it ‘would never happen again’.

But on Friday he was sentenced by a different judge, Judge Robert Fraser, at Inner London Crown Court, who jailed him for 14 months.

Reece's mother Fiona James, 36, who watched from the public gallery, shouted at the judge: ‘Thanks a lot’, before storming out in tears.

Sobbing outside court, she said: ‘I feel so angry I want to smash up the court.

'Why can't they see the difference between a good person who made a mistake and a real criminal?

‘My boy isn't a criminal. I brought him up decent. Being locked up for a first-time offence isn't fair.

‘I'm scared for him, I don't want to leave him. I want to take my sleeping bag and stay outside the prison until he's released. I don't want him to be inside with all those real criminals.’

Speaking before his sentencing, Reece admitted he was terrified that he might be jailed.

He said: ‘I feel stupid and really terrible about what I did. It has jeopardised my career and there's not a day that goes by that I don't regret what I did.

‘I think in the back of my mind I was thinking everybody is doing it and I literally got sucked in.

‘I wanted to write the letter to the judge so he could see things from my point of view.'

Reece said he didn't feel it was right to punish all rioters with prison sentences.

He added: ‘I think the harsh 
sentences that have been handed out are silly. To jail someone for 24 
months for a first offence just doesn't seem right.

‘I know I have to be punished for what I did, I just don't think it's necessary to send me to prison.

‘It makes much more sense to punish me by making me do community service - that way I can make a positive difference.'

After his arrest Reece spent three days in a police cell.

He said: ‘When I got out and told the
other members of Abyss they were obviously upset and really 
disappointed in me and I have been suspended from the group.

‘It's been a bit of a knock for them 
because they've lost quite a few shows because what I did has given them
a bad name. I do feel awful that I've messed everything up.

Reece had been about to complete a 
two-year course in contemporary, ballet and jazz dance at Lewisham 
College, but dropped out after starring in Britain's Got Talent.

In court on Friday, Reece's solicitor Manisha Knights pleaded with Judge Fraser to spare him jail.

She said through teaching dance he 
acted as a mentor to hundreds of children and young people, about 50 of 
whom had asked her if they could attend court to support him.

She said: ‘They wanted to be here to 
say positive things about him, but I dissuaded them from attending 
because they would have had to take time off school or college.

‘How can I persuade you, Your Honour,
to let him walk out of court today and continue doing the good work he 
has done in the community for the past eight years of his life?'

But Judge Fraser ignored her 
pleadings and told Reece: ‘You took full advantage of the fact the shop 
had been broken into and you went in and stole.

'Like for so many other people, it was an opportunity too good to be missed.

‘The total losses and damages 
incurred in London were quite phenomenal and the reality is that you 
have played your part in that overall damage.

‘There is strong mitigation in your 
case and I entirely accept that. It is quite clear to me you are a 
positive role model and have been for a number of years.

‘But by your actions you have 
destroyed a very good reputation and the reality is that this was a very
serious matter and as a result there is no alternative to an immediate 
custodial sentence.’

The dancer was praised by Simon Cowell during his run on the talent show for doing something ‘positive’ with his life.

Cowell told him: 'I actually was very impressed with you. 

'I like the fact that when you get an opportunity to change your lives, you made the most of it.'

His street dance group were popular with viewers, but split the judges when Amanda Holden controversially said they failed to live up to the 2009 winning dance group, Diversity.
