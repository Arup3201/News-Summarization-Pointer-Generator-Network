She's admitted that she feels the need to exercise every day as it affects her mood and has been showcasing a toned new physique lately so it made sense for Nike to snap up Ellie Goulding to front its latest fitness campaign. 

The British platinum-selling artist, who incorporates sport into her everyday life, is the star of the sporty brand's new Just Do It campaign because, they say, she encapsulates everything that it stands for.

'Ellie works hard, trains hard and plays hard to achieve the impossible, with an inspiring amount of inner drive and determination,' said a spokesperson for brand.

And it seems the brand aren't wrong about the 27-year-old singer, who is currently focussing on her training.

She said: 'I’m always trying to increase my distance and speed. I’m doing the Paris 10k soon and aiming to beat my previous time. I have never done a marathon, so there’s also that. But I have also started sprinting recently. That’s my new thing. I am constantly on a journey - there is a lot further to go.' 

Despite often being hectic with shows, appearances and other work commitments, Ellie always finds the time to work out.  

'It’s a prerequisite. It has to happen,' she said. 'All my crew and everyone around me knows that time has to be built into the day for me to exercise. It’s important that I know there is time in my schedule for exercise. 

'I'll always do something. I woke up the other morning, feeling tired and unusually unmotivated, and I made myself a green tea, decided to snap out of it and put some music on and started dancing. My heart rate went up and I felt myself wanting to move - I did some sprints on the spot, some burpees, some lunges and things like that.'

Always on the move: Speaking about fitting exercise into her daily life, Ellie said: 'It’s a prerequisite. It has to happen,' and explains that she can get herself into the mindset even when she is feeling tired and unmotivated 

As well as running, she says she's really into boxing at the moment and trains with her security guard Gareth, who does a certain kind of JujitSu. 

While sport is working wonders on her energy levels and physique, it also helps her confidence.

'Exercise has taught me confidence and discipline in the long-term,' she said. 'Over the years I have managed to learn more about myself and my own motivation and how I push myself through sport, and have then managed to apply that to everything else.'  

Opening up about her work ethic and what inspires her to push herself that extra mile, she revealed that she has conversations with herself when she's about to start a race, a half marathon or a big show. 

Fashionable face: Ellie's most recent outing was at the Chloe show at Paris fashion week, where she joined her best friend Rosie Huntington-Whiteley 

As well as her powerful voice and killer performances, Ellie's on-stage outfits often grab the headlines. So how important is it for her to feel and look good when working out?

'I don’t care that much,' she said. 'For boot camp I wear tiny shorts and a sports bra. The less I wear, the more aware I am of what my body looks like and what it’s actually doing when I move. If I can see what it’s doing - if it’s wobbling - then I can say to myself “Well you need to work on that, Ellie.” 

'Having said that I don’t think I would draw attention to myself by going out running in the smallest clothes I have. In boot camp you can because you’re in the dark.' 

Ellie most recently showed off the fruits of her labour in a flattering outfit as she hit the Chloe show at Paris fashion week. 

Ellie arrived at the high-profile event with her pal Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The ladies worked the cameras perfectly together before taking a front row seat to enjoy what proved to be a marvellous display of high-end fashion. 

Super singer: Ellie has sold millions of hits worldwide so could her exercise regime be to thank? The star says it has boosted her confidence 

Rocking out: While Ellie takes her on-stage outfits seriously, she says she isn't bothered how she looks when she works out, especially at boot camp when she trains in the dark
