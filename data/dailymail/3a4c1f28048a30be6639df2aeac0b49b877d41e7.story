Journalist Michael Hastings, whose death in a fiery car crash earlier this year has become mired in conspiracy theories, had battled drink and drugs since he was a teenager, sources revealed.

Hastings, 33, who was reportedly sober 
for more a decade before relapsing shortly before his death, had traces 
of amphetamine and marijuana in his blood when he died.

Now a detailed look into the tenacious journalist's background reveals that he had struggled for years with his vices and had been unofficially evaluated with bipolar disorder back in his teens, according to a police report.

American journalist Michael Hastings reports from the Obama campaign trail in 2012. His death in an LA car crash earlier this year has prompted conspiracy theories after he had told friends they may be interviewed by the FBI

An exposé by New York Magazine this week, which spoke to the writer's family, friends and colleagues, learned that Hastings started experimenting with substances in high school - lifting the drug-fueled antics described by his hero, the journalist Hunter S. Thompson, straight off the page.

In his first year at Connecticut College, he partied hard and neglected his studies, drinking heavily, smoking pot, taking Adderall, cocaine and crack, the report says.

He was asked to leave in freshman year and moved back in with his parents in Burlington, Vermont while he worked at a local supermarket coffee bar.

Around this time, Hastings crashed his car into a pole and when police turned up at his home to inform his parents, his doctor father told the officers that his son 'suffered from mental illness'. 

During an arrest for 
theft a few months later, Dr Hastings told police he had an 'unofficial 
evaluation indicating M. Hastings had a Manic Depressive Disorder 
(Bipolar)', according to a report seen by nymag.com.

However at the age of 19, Hastings cleaned his life up and quit drinking. He transferred to NYU in 2000 and went on to graduate magna cum laude.

A post that the award-winning writer wrote on his blog in 2009 confirms that timeline: 'I stopped using when I was nineteen. Good for me.'

Conspiracy theories are abound surrounding the death of Rolling Stone writer Michael Hastings with a small shrine being constructed by fans at the site of his fatal car crash in Los Angeles

Hastings made his name covering the 
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and effectively forcing the firing of 
General Stanley McChrystal.

In addition to covering war zones, he 
also lost his girlfriend Andi Parhamovich when she was killed in 
Baghdad, spurring him to write a book about the experience.

Despite his professional success, Hastings himself was aware of the personal toll such terrible events had on him personally.

Following a particularly dangerous trip to Afghanistan in 2010, he wrote: 'You never put yourself in these situations, but you always seem to find yourself in them.

'I know it's a risk, I know it's not a healthy lifestyle. I know it's an addiction; I know it's the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.'

Despite years of being teetotal, in the months before his death, Hastings appeared to have fallen off the wagon.

While on the trail with the Obama campaign in 2012, he drank and took Adderall later saying he had 'a campaign-induced relapse'.

He continued to smoke pot having been given a  prescription for 
medical marijuana to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Los Angeles.

Hastings had also become increasingly jumpy in the weeks leading up to his death, according to friend and colleagues.

He
was working on a profile of CIA director John Brennan at the time he 
died and had told several close friends that they might be interviewed 
by the FBI and that he was going 'off the radar for a bit'. 

The Los Angeles Times
reported that his family were on their way from New York to California
on the day of the crash because they wanted to have an intervention due
to his relapse.

Sadly, at around 4.20am on June 18, Hastings was driving at speed when he flipped his Mercedes and crashed into a palm tree. His body was so badly burned that he had to be identified using a set of his fingerprints that the FBI had on file.

A coroner's report revealed in August that Hastings had drugs in his system at the time of his fatal collision. Police found a medical marijuana card in his wallet at the scene of the crash.

The
Los Angeles County coroner's report said that the drugs were not the 
cause of the fiery crash or his death, as that came due to the massive 
blunt force trauma.

In the know: Relatives were reportedly headed to Los Angeles to have an intervention for Hastings as he had relapsed and started using drugs. His widow, Elise Jordan, says his death was likely just a tragic accident

A number of conspiracy theories surfaced 
about his death immediately following the early morning June 18 accident
as he was revealed to be working on a story about the CIA.

The agency issued a statement shortly after the fact saying that at no point was he under investigation.

His wife, Elise Jordan, spoke out after his death saying that she did not suspect foul play was involved.

'The LAPD still has an active investigation...my gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident and I'm very unlucky and the world is very unlucky,' she said at the time.

The Hastings family had no comment to make when contacted by MailOnline today.
