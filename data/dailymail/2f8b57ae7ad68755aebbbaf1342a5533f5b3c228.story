The FBI have been drafted in to help search for a 16-year-old girl who has been missing for over two months.

Skylar Neese from Star City, West Virginia, was last seen on July 7 when she was spotted on surveillance footage getting into a car at midnight.

Her family and friends are trying to remain hopeful that she will be found, but they are starting to fear the worst.

Where did she go? Last time she was seen Skylar returned from shift at Wendy's and hugged parents before saying she was going to bed

The FBI is now reportedly at Skylar's school interviewing her friends.

The last sighting of the brunette teen was when she returned home from her job at Wendy's and hugged her parents before going to bed saying she was tired.

Footage from the James Place apartments showed that Skylar climbed out of a window at midnight and got into a waiting car, which police later found out belonged to one of her friends.

Skylar's cousin Rikki Woodall, told The Huffington Post: 'The police interviewed the friend and she admitted she picked Skylar up
that night but swears she dropped her off an hour later.

The girl said 
Skylar was insistent that she be dropped off down the street so her 
friend's car did not wake anyone.'

Publicity: Skyar's parents have led a very public hunt for their beloved daughter with posters and T-shirts

According to police, there is no surveillance footage of Skyler returning to the apartment complex.

'We
know she left voluntarily from the surveillance tape, but we have not 
been able to account for her whereabouts since then,' Star City Police 
Chief Vic Propst told Huffington Post.

The last message on her Twitter account was posted on July 5.

The message reads, 'You doing sh*t like that is why I will NEVER completely trust you.'

Skylar's family have led a publicity drive to find the missing teen.

A
few weeks after her disappearance, her friends and family gathered 
outside of the Wal-Mart in the University Town Center in Granville to 
sell T-shirts with her name and picture.

The money raised by the sale was used as a reward to for anyone with information of her whereabouts - so far it totals $3,100. Â 

Skylar is described as a white female, 5'4" tall, 135 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone with information on her whereabouts is asked to contact the Star City Police Department at 304-599-3550.
