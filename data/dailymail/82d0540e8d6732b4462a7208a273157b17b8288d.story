Black
 Beauty's most eye-catching exterior attribute is the two hood-mounted 
Browning .30 caliber machine guns, which when hooked up to a propane 
tank fired flames through the barrel to look like gunfire.

The
 revamped Chrysler is bristling with weaponry, including 12 Stinger 
missiles on the front and rear bumpers, a flame-thrower mounted on the 
front grill, beanbag launchers and shotgun barrels.

The
 pricey, fully functional prop also has a few fun, non-lethal features, such as a 
revolving rear license plate, which flips to 'Hornet' at the press of a 
button on the keychain remote; painted green headlights; the Green 
Hornet logo on the trunk and the interior console labeled in Chinese.

Special features: The Chrysler has its original 413 engine with only 71,421 miles on the odometer and its original black leather seats, but the interior console is labeled in Chinese

Unusual look: The car has 'butterfly doors,' which according to its designer was a challenge to construct

Celebrity test drive: Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno had a chance to inspect Black Beauty up close and even take it for a spin

The car also comes with an impressive stereo system manufactured by Sony, which also produced the 2011 film.

‘Twenty-nine cars were made for the film’s production, most of which were either stripped-down stunt models or destroyed during filming,’ Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, said in a statement. 

Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno, who has a web series called Jay Leno’s Garage devoted to cars, has had a chance to inspect Black Beauty up close, interview the expert who revamped it for the film and even take it for a spin. 

The Green Hornet was first introduced to American audiences in 1936 as a radio drama following the adventures of a wealthy young newspaper publisher who by night turns into a mysterious crime fighter dressed in a green mask and fedora.

The superhero is accompanied by his loyal sidekick Kato, who also doubles as the driver of the Black Beauty. 

In the 1960s, the Green Hornet was turned into a TV show starring the great Bruce Lee as Kato.

Remake: The latest incarnation of the series, a 3D action comedy, was written by Seth Rogen, pictured here behind the wheel of the Black Beauty as the Green Hornet

The latest incarnation of the series hit the big screen in 2011 as a 3D action-comedy starring Seth Rogen, who also co-wrote the film.

While the movie did relatively well in the box office, grossing just shy of $100million, the Hornet has left most critics unimpressed.

Bidding on the Black Beauty started with a price of $10,000 Friday and runs through June 26 on RR Auction’s website.
