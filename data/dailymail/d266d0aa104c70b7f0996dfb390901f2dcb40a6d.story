Sixteen years after his death, his influence over the world of make-up is still strong. 

He is after-all the man credited with 'inventing' cheekbones using contouring techniques, which at the time were revolutionary.

'Kevyn was not just a make-up artist, he was an artist in the broadest sense that could create and paint on any palette,' Naomi Campbell said of the guru.

Aucoin's ethos was to embrace imperfections. 'Perfection is boring. If a face doesn't have mistakes it is nothing,' he said.

Aucoin worked with  A-listers including Linda  Evangelista, (pictured left), and Kate Moss, (pictured right). He also wrote best-selling books and launched an eponymous make-up brand in 2001

The make-up artist also wrote best-selling books and launched an eponymous make-up brand  in 2001, which is still stocked by SpaceNK.

The exhibition, Kevyn Aucoin: The Legacy of a Makeup Icon, opens later this month at SpaceNK's Knightsbridge store to celebrate his work.

The exhibit will include never-before-seen images and sketches from Kevyn's archives, beautiful editorial images, a short film plus personal possessions that inspired his creativity, all donated by the makeup artists family.
