All iPhone owners in America will soon be able to get their screens replaced at Apple stores rather than sending them away to specialty repair shops, according to reports from a U.S technology site.

MacRumours claims that if an Apple customer drops their iPhone and the 
screen cracks, they can now take the phone to a local Apple Genius bar which will replace the screen for around £97 ($149).

Previously only AppleCare+ customers could have their displays fixed by Apple.

Cracking up: At the moment, owners who do not sign up to AppleCare+ are looking at a hefty bill if they crack their iPhone screens

During a drop test by Well, according to a video by phone insurers SquareTrade, the iPhone 5 was more sturdy than the Samsung Galaxy S3. 

In the first test, both phones were dropped from the same height.

The iPhone 5 suffered small scratches while the S3’s screen smashed.

The company then dropped household items onto the devices including a bottle of wine. 

The S3's screen smashed on impact whereas the iPhone 5 survived.

Other customers would have had to take their phones to expert repair stores, or send the phone away for an online repair, paying on average between £120 ($180) and £146 ($225) to get the devices fixed.

And if a third-party fixed the screen, the customer's warranty could be affected.

Apple hasn't confirmed the plans but a number of customers have told MacRumours, and other sources including Cult of Mac, that they have had their screen replaced instore.

It is also unclear whether the service will launch in the UK.

When the iPhone 4 was announced, Steve Jobs claimed the display had been made stronger than previous models.

He added it was 'ultra-durable and more scratch resistant than ever'. 

However, in an independent drop test, technology site T3 managed to crack the device's screen by only dropping the phone four times.

The Genius Bars in Apple stores already provide technical support for customers and now, according to technology site MacRumours, they will soon be able to offer screen repairs. Apple has not confirmed the plans and it is unclear whether the service will launch in the UK

The design of the iPhone 4 and 4S also made it difficult for the screen to be replaced.

Apple's iPhone 5 was launched as being even more scratch- and crack-resistant.

Yet in drop tests the device's screen still smashed on the fifth attempt. 

The iPhone 5, however, has been redesigned to make it easier to remove a cracked screen and slide in a new one.

The reports about Apple's iPhone screen replacement service did not specify whether all models, or just more recent handsets, would qualify.
