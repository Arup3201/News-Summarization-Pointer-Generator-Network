A teacher's aide decided to pull out a wobbly baby tooth of a ten-year-old boy with autism because it was distracting him.

However the aide then managed to pull out the wrong tooth - and removed a molar from fourth-grader Chris Quirk's mouth instead.

The boy's mother Sabrina Grant was considering pressing assault charges after the incident at Wilson Elementary School in Framingham, Massachusetts.Â

Agony: Chris Quirk, 10, had a molar tooth removed by a teacher's aide at school last week

Ms Grant received an email from school staff last week saying that Chris's teacher had noticed he was playing with the tooth and they had decided to remove it.

After the extraction, the school nurse then checked the boy and decided he was fine.

His mother said that her son must have been in a great deal of pain after having a tooth pulled out when it wasn't loose. The baby tooth appeared to have then fallen out on its own.

Ms Grant told local station wcvb.com: 'Oh my god what did they do, did they hold my kid down?

'Did he want them to do this? How could somebody not even medically trained pull a tooth that wasn't even loose out of his mouth?'

Ms Grant kept her son home from school for a week and has demanded that he be put in a different program.

Authorities said that it was not standard practice for teachers who are not trained in dentistry to pull out children's teeth.

The schools' superintendent said an investigation was under way but no disciplinary action had yet been taken.
