New mothers 'obsessed' with getting a size zero figure soon after giving birth should concentrate more on looking after their babies, the women's minister has said.

MP Jo Swinson says she wants women to bond with their newborn and get away from the idea that they have to shed their baby weight quickly.

She points out that there is a lot of pressure for new mothers to get back to their pre-baby shape in the same way as Victoria Beckham who lost all her weight within six weeks of giving birth to Harper Seven.

Initial plans  drawn up with the Department of Health will be discussed by Ms Swinson and representatives from the 
fashion and advertising industry at a conference today.

Walks Beyond the Catwalk, a campaign which promotes diversity in the fashion industry, will also look at other issues in an effort to promote body 
confidence in young people

It is proposed that health visitors on routine checks after births will be trained to spot mothers who appear to be depressed about their body shape or who are trying to squeeze into skinny jeans overnight.

Ms Swinson told The Times she was increasingly concerned with how parents are relaying messages about body image to their children.

She told the paper: 'Many small children see their mother standing in front of the mirror complaining, at a time when their body shape changes a lot.

'Their mums feel they are under pressure to achieve the same standards as Victoria Beckham, who got back to her pre-baby shape (size zero) within about six weeks,' she said.

Former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham was 
reported to have regained her size zero figure within weeks of giving 
birth to her fourth child Harper Seven in July 2011.

Ms Swinson said it is important in the months after the babyâ€™s birth to get mothers involved in baby-bonding time rather than wondering how they can get back into a pair of jeans.

She warned obsessing about image could influence small children's 
perceptions of their image when they get older and also potentially harm the mother's bond with her baby.

Ms Swinson added that another important issue was how fathers related to their daughters and the impact that this could have on eating-related disorders.

She cited research showing that daughters who had a poor relationship with their fathers were more likely to develop eating disorders.

'If fathers start looking at women or talking about attractive women in front of their daughters, that can have an impact,' she said.
