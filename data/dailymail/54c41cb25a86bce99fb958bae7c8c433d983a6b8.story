The man formerly known as Aaron Johnson must be virtually unrecognisable to his school friends these days - both in character and in appearance.

Now known as Aaron Taylor-Johnson - since his marriage this summer to director and artist Sam Taylor-Wood, 45 - the 22-year-old from High Wycombe has, in just three years, become a Hollywood A-lister, a husband, a father of two daughters and a stepfather to two more.

And now, for his role in Joe Wright's updated version of Leo Tolstoy's classic novel Anna Karenina, he has has a physical overhaul of a comparably dramatic nature.

In Wright's film Taylor-Johnson plays the brooding, smouldering Count Vronsky opposite Keira Knightley's Karenina.

For the role he had to dye his dark hair blond and grow a long, twirlable moustache.

He told the Observer: 'I'm kind of like the blond in the movie. It's the golden age, and I'm this dashing blond young officer in a white uniform.'

But the look wasn't to everyone's taste.

Bloggers who have seen the film have already referred to him as 'the blonde poodle'.

One wrote: 'I don't care how beautiful this man is, Vronsky should be dark and dangerous, not blond and poodley.'

Another
 added: 'Bad feeling about the new Anna Karenina film. Is it because 
Count Vronsky seems to have had his hair and make-up done by the 
X-Factor team?'

But it is a slick, manicured, poodly look Taylor-Johnson won't be keeping for very long.

He
 has already begun filming for his new film, the sequel to Matthew 
Vaughn's action comedy Kick-Ass - Kick-Ass 2: Balls To The Wall - a film
 requiring him to get grubby and be 'thrown about a lot'.

Taylor-Johnson
 - who met his future wife on the set of her film Nowhere Boy, in which 
he played a young John Lennon - admits his life has changed dramatically
 since he filmed the first installment to Kick-Ass.

Speaking
 about their two daughters, Wylda and Romy, he said: 'I made Kick-Ass 
just before I started working on Nowhere Boy, and now here I am on 
Kick-Ass 2 and I'm married and a father.

'It's such a major change, but to tell the truth I never think about it much. It just feels natural to me.'

Taylor-Johnson
 got his first real break in acclaimed teenage rom-com Angus, Thongs and
 Perfect Snogging - released in 2008, just one year before Nowhere Boy -
 in which he starred opposite Georgia Groome.

He has been described as 'an old 
soul' by his wife - to whose eldest daughters, Angelica and Jessie, from
 her earlier marriage to art dealer Jay Jopling, he is now stepfather.

Indeed,
 of his own past in High Wycombe he says: 'I haven't been back there in 
about six years. I still see it as a place I wanted to escape from.

'I get on fine with my mum and dad, but if they want to see the grandchildren, they come to me.'

Of his childhood friends he says: 'I haven't got any friends from where I grew up, but that's not to do with fame.

'I moved on from there years ago, I have good friends now, both from Sam's world and my world.

'We're a close-knit family with a close-knit circle of friends. That's the way it is and it's just fine.'

Anna Karenina opens in cinemas on Friday

Chanel loaned the film production of Anna Karenina jewellery in 18-carat gold, diamonds and pearls. The most valuable piece, the Camelia Poudré necklace is worth £800,000

Anna Karenina, the heroine of Leo 
Tolstoy's 1873 masterpiece, has been played by some of the world's most 
iconic actresses: Greta Garbo, Vivien Leigh, Marlene Dietrich and Ingrid
 Bergman.

Now Britain's Keira Knightley joins this roll-call in a production so 
lavish it puts her previous costume dramas in the shade.

The
 film is the latest collaboration between the 27-year-old Pirates Of The
 Caribbean star and director Joe Wright, a partnership that has resulted
 in Baftas and Oscar nominations for Pride & Prejudice and 
Atonement.

Original plans were for a period adaptation shot on location in Russia.

Then, just 12 weeks before filming, Wright made an audacious U-turn.

'It
 was pretty radical,' says Knightley. 'We were going to St Petersburg 
and Moscow. Then all of a sudden I got a call from Joe asking, "Can you 
come round here please?"

'I
 live round the corner from him so he took me into his office and 
explained, "There’s been a bit of a change of plan." He said, "It’s all 
set in a theatre now…" And the viewer watches the drama unfold as if 
sitting in the stalls.'

Anna Karenina, the story of an 
aristocratic wife and mother in 19th-century Russia who embarks on an 
all-consuming affair, is a largely British production.

Knightley is 
joined by Jude Law (unrecognisable as her elder-statesman husband 
Karenin) and Aaron Johnson (her passionate young lover Count Vronsky), 
while the film is produced by Tim Bevan of Working Title. 

Jude Law's looks had to be disguised for the role of Karenin, while his costume was inspired by Tsar Alexander II

'I've watched Keira mature as an actor,' says Joe Wright

Sir Tom Stoppard was wooed to write the screenplay by the combination of Knightley and Tolstoy.

'You need a clever actress to play Anna Karenina and Keira has very good instincts,' says the 75-year-old playwright.

'And she is extraordinarily beautiful.'

The result is a radical cinematic conceit that may divide critics.

'What's the point of doing a safe adaptation?' asks Knightley.

'If you're going out you might as well go out with a bang.'

Costumes were inspired by Fifties fashion designers such as Dior and Balenciaga. Keira Knightley had 16 different outfits and each dress took 40 hours to create
