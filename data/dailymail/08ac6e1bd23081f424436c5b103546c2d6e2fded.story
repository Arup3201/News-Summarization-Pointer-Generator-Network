Leaders of the legal profession yesterday dropped their controversial advice to lawyers on how to draw up wills according to Islamic sharia law.

The Law Society apologised for putting out a guidance note which told solicitors to draw up sharia wills that give male heirs double the amounts inherited by women.

It also told lawyers they should cut illegitimate and adopted children out of any inheritance.

Andrew Caplen, president of the professional body for solicitors, said: ‘We reviewed the note in the light of criticism. We have withdrawn the note and we are sorry.’

The guidance, issued to lawyers amid deep controversy in the spring, was seen as a major advance for sharia law. The religious legal code is seen by critics as discriminating against women and running contrary to basic principles of English law.

It told solicitors drawing up wills for Muslim clients who wanted their estates distributed according to sharia rules: ‘The male heirs in most cases receive double the amount inherited by a female heir of the same class.

‘Non-Muslims may not inherit at all, and only Muslim marriages are recognised.’

The guidance said divorced husbands or wives cannot inherit under sharia rules, and instructed lawyers: ‘You should amend clauses which define the term children or issue to exclude those who are illegitimate or adopted.’

Inheritance law allows people to leave as much as they like to whoever they like in their wills. But the Law Society came under heavy criticism after issuing the advice. 

The organisation, which operates firm equality rules, was seen as encouraging its members to collude in discriminating against women and others who are disadvantaged under sharia law.

Mr Caplen said: ‘Our practice note was intended to support members to better serve their clients as far as is allowed by the law of England and Wales.’

The National Secular Society, which had been pressing the Law Society to withdraw the advice, said it welcomed the decision.

Director Keith Porteous Wood said: ‘This is an important reversal for what had seemed to be the relentless march of sharia to becoming British law. 

'Until now, politicians and the legal establishment either encouraged this process or spinelessly recoiled from acknowledging what was happening.

‘This is particularly good news for women who fare so badly under sharia law, which is a non-democratically determined, non-human rights compliant and discriminatory code.’

Sharia rulings are made by an estimated 85 tribunals attached to mosques throughout the country. 

The decisions made in them have no force in English law, but operate on a voluntary basis, with all parties agreeing to be bound by rulings.

English courts often rubber stamp sharia court decisions. 

In divorce cases, for example, a judge will in many cases examine documents and forms submitted after a decision in a sharia tribunal and declare the divorce official in English law

Sharia law has gained growing respectability, particularly on the political left, since 2003, when the then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said British courts might recognise sharia tribunals and that official acceptance of sharia ‘seems unavoidable’.
