Co-stars: Sir Roger with Eleanor Parker in Interrupted Melody in 1955

As James Bond he could have any woman he desired but it appears that even Sir Roger Moore has one that got away.

The 87-year-old has revealed he fell 'secretly in love' with actress Eleanor Parker after they appeared together in a film in 1955.

But, speaking publicly about his feelings for the first time, Sir Roger said he never made a move on the Sound of Music star because they were both married at the time.

In fact, Miss Parker died last year at the age of 91, without ever knowing the impact she had on the actor.

In an interview on BBC Radio 3's Private Passions, Sir Roger said working opposite Miss Parker on film Interrupted Melody left a lasting impression on him.

He also said the project, about Australian opera singer Marjorie Lawrence, kindled his love for the musical style, particularly Verdi and Puccini.

He said: 'I was very fortunate enough to make a film with Eleanor Parker in which she played Marjorie Lawrence, an Australian operatic star who developed poliomyelitis, and I played her brother Cyril and we had wonderful excerpts from all the operas and liking and having a great affection for music, music of any sort except for 'yeah, yeah, yeah', I had a wonderful time on the whole.

'I'm often asked 'Who has you worked with who you really thought was great?' and I think Eleanor Parker was the first and one of the only who was a really accomplished actress, a really caring actress, who was most unselfish and I was secretly in love with her. Of course, she was married to a wonderful painter and I was married elsewhere.'

Miss Parker, best known for her role as the Baroness in The Sound of Music, was five year's Sir Roger's senior at 33 and married to Hollywood portrait painter Paul Clemens, the third of her four husbands.

She was already a big star, having had critically acclaimed roles in Detective Story and Caged.

Sir Roger, by contrast was still relatively unknown, three years before he would make his name in television series Ivanhoe and nearly two decades before he would take on the mantle of 007. At the time, he was married to Welsh singer Dorothy Squires, the second of his four wives.

Miss Parker, who was nominated for three Oscars, including one for Interrupted Melody, died in December last year from complications with pneumonia. She never worked with Sir Roger again and it is not known if the pair kept in contact outside of work.

In the wide ranging interview, broadcast on Sunday, the actor speaks openly about his home life and paints a picture of himself as a romantic husband, dancing with his wife, Swedish socialite Kristina Tholstrup, 72, every night before bed.

The radio programme is based around celebrities choosing their favourite pieces of classical music and, picking the slow movement of Mozart's piano concerto number 20 in D minor, Sir Roger, a father of three, explained: 'It's one of our bedtime tunes, I have it on my iPhone and about ten minutes before we're due to sleep, we close the books and I put the music on.

'My wife studied ballet and she does a little dance and I get up and I try to dance, I try to move my old arthritic knees. We have a little music and then the light goes off, it's one of our bedtime tunes.'

While a love of classical music has been a thread running through much of the actor's life, one of his biggest regrets is giving up on his desire to play the violin, which he began lessons at a young age.

After picking the opening of Tchaikovsky's violin concerto in D as one of his pieces because of his 'real passion for strings', he said: 'I am privileged to be at the right end of violins, not the end holding it but to listen to it. When I was eight, an uncle, great uncle, gave a violin to me and my father took me off to have lessons. After about six weeks the violin teacher told my father he was wasting his money, wasting his time and wasting my time and it's one of my big regrets.'
