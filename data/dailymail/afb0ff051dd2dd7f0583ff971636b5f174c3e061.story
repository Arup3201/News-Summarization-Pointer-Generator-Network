These kaleidoscopic photographs show the inside of the colourful Crayola factory which produces around 12million crayons every day. 

Photographer Bryan Derballa, 32, captured the incredible crayon-making process during a visit to the factory in Easton, Pennsylvania.

Crayola, which was founded in 1885, uses a complicated production line to make the iconic colouring sticks.

Mr Derballa's pictures provide a fascinating glimpse into the creation of the crayons which certainly take many of us back to our childhoods.

Photographer Bryan Derballa took these stunning pictures inside the Crayola factory. Here, crayons are separated and funnelled into boxes

The photographer, from New York, said he walked for miles as he photographed the manufacturing process.

He said: 'The factory was massive. I probably walked a couple of miles during the course of our shoot just moving from one end of the factory to the other.

'That doesn't even include the storage and shipping departments that we saw but didn't really cover.

His pictures show a silo, which contains 100,000lbs of uncoloured paraffin wax and is heated and moved to mixing kettles. Powdered pigment is then added to create a colour.

The coloured liquid is then pumped into a water-cooled mould, before it is ejected through crayon-shaped cavities and sent for labelling.

Once labels are attached, completed crayons are separated by funnels, which help sort them into 24 count boxes to be sold

Once the label has been attached, the crayons roll off the production line and are fed into funnels, which help sort them into boxes.

Finally, the boxes are date coded and checked via a metal detector, which confirms there are only crayons inside.

Mr Derballa added: 'I loved the mixing kettles where the pigment is mixed with the melted wax - they were these beautiful vats of molten colour.

'One of the best parts of this shoot was how earnest and innocent it all was.

'And the smell of paraffin brought me back to my childhood.'

Crayola, founded in 1885, claims to have 99% name recognition across US households - and even the factory hallway is a riot of colour
