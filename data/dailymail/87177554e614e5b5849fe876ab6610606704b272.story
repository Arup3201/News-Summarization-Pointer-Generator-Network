Standing atop his column in Trafalgar Square, Nelson may soon be forced to stare down at a reminder of the nation he defeated - in the form of a giant electric blue cockerel.

The 15ft-tall fibreglass bird, designed by German artist Katharina Fritsch, is due to be placed on the fourth plinth on July 20.

But a conservation group, headed by a senior judge, has opposed the planned installation, saying it is 'totally inappropriate' for the site in central London.

The cock is the national symbol of France - and the Thorney Island Society claims the artwork is unsuitable, given Nelson defeated the French navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

In a letter to Westminster City Council, the society's chairman Jane Stubbs, wrote: 'We cannot see any logical reason for the proposed sculpture to be placed on the fourth plinth.

'It is unrelated to the context of Trafalgar Square and adds nothing to it but a feeble distraction.'

The letter from the group, which has Lord Justice of Appeal Sir Nicholas Underhill as its president, continued that the artist's claim that the 'cockerel is a symbol for regeneration, awakening and strength' was weak.

Nor were the campaigners impressed with Fritsch's boast that the giant bird should be viewed as 'a rude interruption to the grey formal architecture of the square', according to the Independent.

The society - whose patrons include musician Jools Holland and Labour politician Lord Hattersley, and counts Conservative MP Alan Duncan as vice president - has just days to convince the council, which has recommended the plans be approved by next Tuesday.

And this is how it could soon look...

Katharina Fritsch told Westminster City Council her artwork (pictured here using an artist's impression) provoked mischief by being put in a square that celebrates victory over the French

Speaking on the controversy surrounding the sculpture, entitled Hahn/Cock, councillor Robert Davis, deputy leader of Westminster City Council, told the Evening Standard: 'I’m sure if this gets planning permission, it will cause quite a stir, particularly because it will be placed under the gaze of Admiral Lord Nelson.

'However, I do wonder what Nelson’s reaction would have been after returning home from battle only to be greeted by the French emblem standing proudly in the centre of London.'

In her defence, Fritsch told the council that her artwork provoked mischief by being put in a square that celebrates victory over the French - and would act as a 'species interloper' at a place famed for attracting pigeons.

In a sign that the council is likely to approve the installation, it said any perceived harm to the conservation area would be 'offset by the public interest' in the public art.

A member of the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, Matthew Slotover, said: 'If you want a sculpture that looks like something that was made over 500 years ago, it's not going to be an interesting sculpture.'

The fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square was originally intended for an equestrian statue but has remained unfilled for 150 years.

But since 1998, it has been used to showcase a rotating collection of artworks...

... but wouldn't Maggie be a more fitting choice?

A statue of Margaret Thatcher could be erected in Trafalgar Square under plans being considered by ministers.

Downing
Street gave the idea of a permanent memorial to the former Prime 
Minister its backing as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed the 
fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square ‘could be one of the options’.

Boris
Johnson also came out in support of the idea, which has been publicly 
backed by former military personnel who served in the victorious 
Falklands campaign in 1982.

There is a growing clamour for a 
statue to be placed in central London on public view, to mark Baroness 
Thatcher’s immense impact on Britain.

In
particular there are calls to use the vacant plinth in the shadow of 
Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square, at the opposite end of Whitehall 
from the Houses of Parliament.

However,
there are concerns that any memorial could become the target of vandals
and protests, after police clashed with revellers at hate-filled street
parties ‘celebrating’ Baroness Thatcher’s death on Monday at the age of
87.
