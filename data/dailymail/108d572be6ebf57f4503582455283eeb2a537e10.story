Qatar Air has become the first airline to take delivery of the Airbus A350XWB- the world's newest passenger jet. 

With its 21st century design, eye-catching swooped back 'winglets' and large fuselage for extra space and passenger comfort, manufacturers Airbus claim it is the future of long-haul travel.

Able to carry more than 300 passengers a time, the gleaming aircraft has been packed with clever features such as the LED onboard lighting which has a staggering 16.7 million possible colour permutations.

The cabin is pressurized to a height equivalent of 6,000 feet (1,828 meters) instead of a more standard 8,000 feet to reduce the effect of jet lag.

It is also dramatically greener and more efficient than most planes, emitting 25 per cent less CO2 than current aircraft in its category and is claimed to be 'by far the quietest aircraft in the industry.'

With an engine deigned by the aerospace division of Rolls Royce, and with more than half of Airbus A350WXB  made of  composite materials, it also lays claim to having the most fuel efficient large aircraft engine  in the world.

Integrated seat-back displays in economy are 10.6 inches (26.9 centimeters), powered by Thales or Panasonic, depending on each airline's preference, which allow tablets and smart phones to be plugged in and powered from the seat backs

It's first customer- Qatar Airways- finally took delivery of the Airbus A350WXB in December after placing an order for 80 at the Paris Air Show seven years ago 

Competing with the likes of the Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and the latest 777 models, Airbus are attempting to take slice of the world's expanding fleet of twin-aisle aircraft.

By last month, the A350 XWB had already won 780 orders from 40 customers worldwide.

Other futuristic features include an integrated seat-back display in economy, with 10.6 inches (26.9 centimeters) screens powered by Thales or Panasonic, depending on each airline's preference, which allows tablets and smart phones to be plugged in and powered directly from the seat.

Fibre optics have also been used to integrate the cable for in-flight entertainment screens to a box under the seat, rather than the floor, to give passengers more space to stretch out.

The plane features an eye-catching swooped back winglet design which is likely to make it a distinctive craft at airports round the world

The aircraft's extra-wide body seats four abreast in the 42-seat business class sections, nine abreast in the two economy cabins, and it also boasts some of the flattest sidewalls in the business to allow passengers in the window seats to take a nap without waking up without a crick in the neck.

The A350  comes in three sizes, the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000.

His Excellency Mr Al Baker, Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, said in a press conference at the time: 'It is truly a remarkable moment – where Qatar Airways, Airbus and Rolls-Royce are proud to be making history.'

'Today marks a design of a decade. It has forecasted that there will not be a brand new aircraft type developed for another ten years from now.

'Our new aircraft is state of the art and is visionary in every respect- the design, the environmental impact and the experience.

'The A350 features a beautiful new design on the wing, that is sharp, smooth and flexible-all intelligently coordinated, all highly ahead of the curve.

'It is also dramatically more green and sensitive to the environment and this is by far the quietest aircraft in the industry.'

A spokesman for Rolls Royce's aerospace division, which created the RR Trent XWB x2 engine, said the company was proud to have created the 'most fuel efficient large aero engine flying in the world.'
