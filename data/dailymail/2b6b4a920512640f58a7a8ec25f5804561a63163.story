The saga of Anthony Weiner's mayoral campaign has come to a close as his wife was able to add in one final insult to her politician husband by refusing to accompany him to the primary polls this morning.

Weiner said that his wife, Huma Abedin, had to take a call for work and was unable to accompany him to the polling station. In addition to this being a busy time in her personal life, this is busy for Abedin who has been Hillary Clinton's aide for decades and she spent the night before the election in D.C. attending a fundraiser for her boss. 

Instead the disgraced former Congressman took his son Jordan inside the voting booth with him on Tuesday as he cast his ballot, which well be the last time his name appears on such a paper.

Aside from dealing with the crying toddler and struggling to get him back into his stroller, Weiner had another problem this morning: he almost wasn't able to vote for himself.

Big day: Weiner took his son Jordan into the voting booth with him but his wife Huma was nowhere to be seen

Different takes: Weiner gave a camera-ready grin while Jordan was crying

Daddy duty: The toddler did not seem excited about leaving the polling place either as his father put him in his stroller

When he arrived at his polling place 
in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, his signature was not included in 
the local polling book which is required for anyone casting a ballot.

Poll
 operators had to speak to a member of the Board of Elections who said 
that his signature is on file and it was an administrative error that it
 was left out of his local book.

He joked that it was because he is 'not very well known'.

The vote came hours after he gave his explosive final interview for his mayoral campaign, facing off with MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell who asked him point blank: 'What is wrong with you?'

With the final pre-primary poll reporting that Weiner had seven per cent of Democratic support, O'Donnell said that it appeared that he had a psychological need to be in elective office.

Problem: Abedin stood by her husband when his latest sexting relationship was revealed in July

The
 interview proceeded into a shouting match where O'Donnell said that 
even when Weiner was out of office following his 2011 Twitter scandal, 
he was doing 'the classic hack thing' by lobbying and plotting a return 
to public life.

Weiner 
denied that, attacking O'Donnell for not allowing him to respond, but he
 never gave a counter point to say what he did do during that time 
except to say that he earned money to support his family. Previous 
reports in The New York Times revealed in April that he and his wife brought in a combined salary of $496,000 in 2012.

O'Donnell
 did not attack Weiner's sexting habits- which he explained as 'just 
standard american photography that is floating around the internet now'-
 but took issue with 'your absolute desperate need for elective office 
and what seems to be your inability to live outside of it'.

Weiner then went on the defensive, 
making jabs O'Donnell's show, his network, and the decision to avoid 
talking about the issues that he believed appeal to New Yorkers.

'I don't understand the question. what
 is wrong with me that I care so much about the issues that I fight for 
every day that I have my entire career?' he responded.

The shouting match was still ramped up 
when the eight-minute video came to an end, so they continued for a 
second segment that was available online.

That was not his first problematic interview on Monday as he went into the last full day of the campaign with a rough attitude as he was rude and dismissive to Today's Savannah Guthrie when she brought up his wife Huma Abedin's diminished role in the campaign following the revelation of Weiner's sexting relationship with Sydney Leathers.

'I know you have this fascination about making this a soap opera but for citizens of the city of New York, a lot of them wanted this to be about the issues of the campaign,' he said.

Weiner is no stranger to hecklers and he has gotten into repeated shouting matches with constituents during the campaign. The most memorable instance came recently when a Jewish Brooklyn resident reportedly chided him for marrying ‘an Arab’ and Weiner proceeded to call him a ‘jackass’.

Back in the game: The Democratic race for city comptroller is very close and some polls have Eliot Spitzer (pictured today) leading while others have his opponent Scott Stringer

In the early days of the race to take over the mayor's seat when Michael Bloomberg leaves office this year, Weiner had a brief run in the lead, with some of the eight other Democratic candidates trailing closely behind.

Now the race looks very different.

Bill de Blasio, who previously served as the city's public advocate, went into Primary Day with 39 per cent of the Democratic vote while his main competition- Bill Thompson and Christine Quinne- both followed with 20 per cent each.

If that 39 per cent does not turn into
 40 or more when the polls close at 9pm, there will be a run off among 
the top Democrats to see who will face the Republican nominee in 
November.

The mayor's race 
is not the only scandal-tainted race that the City will be putting an 
end to on Tuesday as the competition to become the next comptroller 
heated up when disgraced former Governor Eliot Spitzer threw his hat in 
the ring alongside former Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer.

The next first couple? Bill de Blasio, seen here with his wife Chirlane McCray, was leading among Democrats

A head above: De Blasio, seen voting on Tuesday, had 39 per cent of the vote while Bill Thompson and Christine Quinn were tied for second with 20 per cent

Looking for a run off: If no Democrat wins 40 per cent or more, a run-off occurs between the top two candidates, and that is the scenario that could keep Bill Thompson in the race

Thompson and his wife Elsie McCabe voted in Harlem on Tuesday
