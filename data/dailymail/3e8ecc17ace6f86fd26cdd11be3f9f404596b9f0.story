An Australian elephant keeper, who was almost crushed to death by the animal she had cared for from its birth, told for the first time today how she felt ‘challenged’ before the beast attacked her.

Lucy Melo, 40, who spent 12 days in hospital after suffering a heart attack and severe injuries when the elephant pinned her to a metal bollard at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, said she noticed a change in the usually timid Pathi Harn moments before the attack.

Miss Melo gave a dramatic insight into the incident in a letter posted on the Taronga Zoo website today.

She told how the elephant’s trunk, which he had forced against her chest, took her breath away and prevented her from ordering him to move away.

Although conscious when paramedics arrived at the zoo, she then lapsed into a coma and had a cardiac arrest for about five minutes. The medics managed to save her life but she remained critical in hospital for several days afterwards.

Miss Melo said she noticed a change in the two-year-old elephant – formerly known as Mr Shuffles – when he failed to respond to one of her orders during a routine training session.

‘When he did not respond, I sensed a behavioural change in him and realised he was thinking of challenging me,’ she wrote of the elephant she and other keepers had hand-reared followed his traumatic birth.

‘I immediately tried to redirect his thoughts by asking him for a different behaviour and at the same time I was making my way out of the stall.

‘Unfortunately, just as I was almost out, he raised his trunk and pinned me against one of the metal bollards.

‘His trunk on my chest took my breath away, which made it impossible for me to talk and tell him to stop.’

Miss Melo said it was fortunate that her co-workers were on hand to immediately move the elephant away.

She suggested that Pathi Harn might have challenged her because of his low confidence levels following his traumatic birth, which had resulted in him being hand reared by Miss Melo and other keepers.

Despite her injuries, which included broken ribs, Miss Melo has decided to courageously continue raising Pathi Harn.

She said that being a part of raising the elephant after such a traumatic start to his life remained one of the biggest highlights of her career.

She was looking forward, she said, to being reunited with Pathi Harn once her fractured ribs had healed.
