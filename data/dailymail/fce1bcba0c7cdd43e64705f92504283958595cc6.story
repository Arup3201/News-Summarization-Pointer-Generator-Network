A driver has been arrested after a £200,000 supercar  was allegedly spotted driving at 150mph on the M25.

The black and white Ferrari California  was pulled over by two police cars last night on the busy motorway near Woking, Surrey.

The car has been seized by police while a man, aged 25, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and has since been bailed.

Surrey Police tweeted this message last night after this Ferrari California was alleged seen doing 150mph

The car was allegedly seen doing the high speeds between junctions 8 and 10 of the M25 in Surrey

Officers say the high-performance vehicle, the first model of which was released in 2008, was seen doing 150mph between junctions eight, near Reigate, and junction 10, near Woking.

The police force tweeted a photo of the car alongside the message: '#M25 J8-10 Ferrari California 150mph with two police cars behind. Vehicle seized and driver arrested.'

The force later revealed it had 'numerous calls' about the car and responded within three minutes.

It is believed the police cars which pulled over the Ferrari were BMW 530s, which a police source described as 'pretty nifty, if not as fast as a Ferrari'.

The Italian-made vehicle appears to have a personalised number plate and red interior.

Other motorists on Twitter expressed shock that the vehicle managed to reach such speeds on a road famous for its heavy traffic.

Dawn Denyer tweeted: 'I'm normally lucky to get to 60mph on that stretch. Is that what the new variable speed signs are for?'

The car is built at the famous manufacturer's plant in Maranello, Italy and does 0-60 in less than four seconds

Motorists expressed shock at claims the car could reach such speeds on the road known for heavy traffic
