Not proud: William Lietzau has said Guantanamo's detainees should have been legally designated as prisoners of war and held in Afghanistan, or taken to American prisons if charged

The Pentagon official in charge of 
Guantanamo Bay has admitted that if he had his time over, he would have 
argued that the notorious detention camp should never have been built.

William
 Lietzau, America’s Deputy Assistant Defence Secretary for Detainee 
Affairs, told The Mail on Sunday in an exclusive interview that 
Guantanamo’s detainees should have been legally designated  as prisoners
 of war and held  in Afghanistan, or if charged with crimes, taken to 
prisons  in America.

Mr
 Lietzau – who, after three and a half years in his job, last week 
announced he will be stepping down to take a private sector job in 
September –  added that the best way for President Obama to close 
Guantanamo would be to announce that the ‘war’ with  Al Qaeda is over.

Under
 international law, this would end any justification for continuing to 
hold prisoners who had not been charged  with crimes.

Lietzau’s
 words will be seen  as explosive, because alone of senior officials who
 serve the Obama administration in this field now, he played a key role 
in creating Guantanamo under George W. Bush.

As
 a senior military lawyer from early  2002 to mid-2003, he designed the 
Guantanamo ‘military commissions’ – special tribunals set up to try 
terrorist suspects.

These
 have proved a dismal failure. Their rules have repeatedly changed, and 
more than a decade after five men accused of plotting 9/11 were 
captured, their case is bogged down in pre-trial hearings which have no 
end in sight.

Mr 
Lietzau said that if he were advising the Bush administration now, ‘I 
would argue that detainees should be kept in Afghanistan, or, if moving 
them is necessary, then into the United States. If I could change one 
thing in Gitmo’s past, I would have called them prisoners of war from 
the beginning.’

That, he said, would have meant
 their legal status would have been clear from the outset. They would 
also have been covered by Common Article Three of the Geneva Convention,
 which was not applied to Guantanamo detainees until a Supreme Court 
decision in 2006.

Many
 legal critics say that it was America’s failure to recognise Geneva 
after 9/11 which opened the road to torture and prisoner abuse. Mr 
Lietzau admitted: ‘There were people who were treated badly, and this is
 not something we are proud of.’

However,
 he insisted such abuse had stopped, saying that some detainees had 
become adept at making false allegations. ‘They know that  we look into 
every credible allegation, and that absorbs an enormous amount of 
manpower and effort .  .  . With Gitmo, the amount of deceptive smoke 
overwhelms the tiny amount of fire from years ago.’

He declined to be drawn as to whether
 anyone should still be prosecuted and tried under the military tribunal
 system he helped create.

But
 he added if any more detainees beyond the six currently facing military
 commissions were to be charged, it might well be better to do this in 
ordinary federal courts. ‘They have many advantages, such as the number 
of offences which can be prosecuted in them.’

Lietzau
 agreed that restrictions imposed by Congress on releasing or 
transferring detainees have ensured that progress towards closing 
Guantanamo has ground to  a halt.

The
 answer, he said, was take a more radical step. ‘Just like you can’t 
kill your way out of this war, you’re not going to transfer your way out
 of Gitmo.

‘The really hard question is, “How do you end this war?”

Once you do, we legally have to let them all go, other than those we prosecute.’

He
 said Bush’s term ‘the global war on terrorism’ had suffered from a lack
 of clarity, suggesting that it might be effectively limitless.

‘The
 struggle with terrorism is not going to end. But we do have to end the 
legally cognizable armed conflict with Al Qaeda, a specific 
transnational group.

‘Arguably,
 if the war aim of diminishing Al Qaeda’s ability to mount a certain 
level of attack has been achieved, we could declare an end to 
hostilities and return to dealing with the threat as a law enforcement 
matter.’
