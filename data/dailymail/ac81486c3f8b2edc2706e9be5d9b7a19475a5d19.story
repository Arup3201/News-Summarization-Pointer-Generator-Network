Christians should challenge the greed and selfishness behind poverty, the Archbishop of Canterbury said in his first Christmas Day sermon.

Addressing a congregation at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said: ‘Even in a recovering economy, Christians, the  servants of a vulnerable and poor saviour, need to act to serve and love the poor.’

The Archbishop, who was installed in March, cited a poll that suggested the Church was more trusted on politics than religion, saying: ‘The two  cannot be separated. No  society can be content where misery and want exist, unless, through our love collectively, we also challenge the greed and selfishness behind it.’

Message: Mr Welby called on Christians to 'challenge the causes of poverty', despite signs of an economic recovery in the UK

Mr Welby, who was enthroned as leader of the 77 million-strong Anglican community in March, condemned the treatment of Christian communities in the Middle East who are being ‘attacked and massacred’ and the ongoing suffering in South Sudan.

‘We see injustice in the ever more seriously threatened Christian communities of the Middle East,’ he said.

‘They are attacked and massacred, driven into exile from a region in which their presence has always been essential.

‘We see terrible news in South Sudan, where political ambitions have led towards ethnic conflict. On Saturday I was speaking to a bishop under siege, in a compound full of the dying.

‘We see injustices at home,’ he added.

‘Even in a recovering economy, Christians, the servants of a vulnerable and poor saviour, need to act to serve and love the poor; they need also to challenge the causes of poverty.’

Mr Welby, who launched a crusade against payday lenders earlier this year, cited a poll in Prospect magazine which suggested the church is more trusted on politics than religion, before adding: ‘The two cannot be separated’.

‘Christ's birth is not politics, it is love expressed,' he said.

‘Our response is not political, but love delivered in hope. The action of the churches in the last five years is extraordinary, reaching out in ways not seen since 1945.

‘Yet no society can be content where misery and want exist, unless through our love collectively we also challenge the greed and selfishness behind it.’

The Archbishop, who has more than 48,000 followers on Twitter, had earlier posted a Christmas video message on the photo-sharing website Instagram.

In the message, he said: ‘Christmas means that, through Jesus, God shows unconditionally that he loves us. I pray that he gives you a very blessed Christmas.’
