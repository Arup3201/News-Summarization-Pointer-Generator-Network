Sunrise panellists Elka Whalan and Sally Obermeder have come under fire after suggesting parents had the right to choose whether to vaccinate their kids.

Both mums joined host David Koch and commentator Shelly Horton on the program for a spirited debate about vaccination on Wednesday morning.

The discussion came just weeks after baby Riley Hughes died in a Perth hospital after suffering complications from whooping cough. 

In views later labelled 'dangerous and irresponsible', Ms Whalan suggested parents should take anti-vaccination views into consideration. 

And in a fiery exchange with host David Koch, Ms Obermeder said that parents choose whether or not to vaccinate out of love for their children.

Ms Whalan said: 'We are hearing this terrible story (about baby Riley) but we are also not hearing figures of people who have also died from being vaccinated as well.' 

The former Olympic swimmer said she vaccinated her children, adding that people need to 'research both sides of the story'.

Ms Obermeder, the host of The Daily Edition and a mother of one, argued: 'Isn't it the parents' right to choose what they want for their child?'

'No parent chooses to do it or not do it because they don't love their child,' she told the panel. 'Parents love their kids, and they make the best decision... (they) think they're making.'  

Her remarks sparked a heated riposte from David Koch, a grandfather and the dad of four adult children.

Koch said parents must depend on the word of experts, not 'Dr Google' (or information parents find online). 

'There is no argument,' he said.

Ms Obermeder said parents should speak to their doctors about vaccination and that people would then 'probably decide' to vaccinate. 

'No parent chooses to do it or not do it because they don't love their child', Ms Obermeder told the panel

Media personality Mia Freedman flayed Elka Whalan for her remarks on Twitter

Media identity Mia Freedman honed in on Ms Whalan's comments on social media, labelling them 'truly dangerous and irresponsible' in a series of Twitter posts. 

Ms Whalan fired back: '@MiaFreddman every parent & person well educated has the right to research. I am pro vaccine but you must see every side.' 

The parents of Riley Hughes urged parents to get their children vaccinated earlier this month. 

After their call, West Australian authorities approved a plan for mums-to-be to receive free whooping cough vaccinations. 

Around 2500 mums will be eligible to receive the jabs each month.   

'Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,' Riley's dad Greg wrote on the family's Facebook page.
