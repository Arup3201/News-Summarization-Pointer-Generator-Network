An eight-year-old girl died after getting stuck inside a turtle made of ice in her native Siberia.

Schoolgirl Viktoria Adaeva became trapped after climbing into a hole in the frozen sculpture in the remote village of Kozulka.

'She was probably screaming for help but no-one could hear her,' said one report.

Tragic: Viktoria Adaeva, 8, died after getting stuck inside a turtle made of ice in her native Siberia

Terrifying: The schoolgirl became trapped after climbing into a hole in the frozen sculpture in the remote village of Kozulka

The girl was playing alone at the icy playground when she climbed into a hole in the ice-sculpted turtle.

The clearing had been made by children, reported the Siberian Times.

'In temperatures of around minus 7C, her head, neck and one hand became stuck and froze to the side of the ice hole.

'This apparently also stopped air coming in for her to breathe.  Unable to move, it is believed she died of a lack of air. '

Her frantic grandmother Lubov Sergeevna called police after failing to find the girl. Officers found her lifeless body trapped in the ice hole.

CCTV cameras were trained on the ice 
playground but the security men did not see Viktoria at the park, said 
police in Krasnoyarsk region.

Sculptures like the turtle are 
popular with children all over Siberia in the winter where playgrounds 
can often be carved out of ice.
