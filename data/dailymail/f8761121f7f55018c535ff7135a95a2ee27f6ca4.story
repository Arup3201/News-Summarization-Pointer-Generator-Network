A pet dog was starved by its owners to the point where it tried to eat an umbrella to stave off hunger.

Paddy, a two-year-old black spaniel, was so malnourished that he weighed just nine kilograms when he began to chew on the black plastic brolly in a desperate bid for sustenance. 

Rachael Pugsley, 37, and her husband Richard, 38 reluctantly took their pet to a vet when they found the tattered umbrella and realised what had happened.

Starved: Paddy had not been fed properly for three weeks and was dehydrated, a court heard

Last resort: According to a vet, the malnourished dog turned to the umbrella as a desperate source of food

Staff became suspicious when, after being told that Paddy needed a £1,000 operation to remove parts of the umbrella from his intestine, Mrs Pugsley left the dog with the vet.

She said she need to talk about the cost of the operation with her husband and would return in 'ten minutes'.

She never came back, forcing the RSPCA to launch an investigation.

Inspectors said that Paddy would have 'died a slow and painful death' if experts had not intervened, Dartford Magistrates’ Court heard.

The Pugsleys, who have three children and two other dogs, were summoned to court twice in August of this year but failed to show.

They finally attending a hearing on October 17 when they were fined and ordered to carry out community service.

Thin: The signs of Paddy's neglect were instantly spotted by vets who were able to see the dog's ribcage through his coat, above

Vet Bruce McLeary, who treated the dog, said: 'The dog was so hungry, it’s no surprise that it chose to eat an umbrella.'

Andrew Wiles, prosecuting, said: 'The dog was seen by the nurse and the account given was that the dog had eaten part of an umbrella two days previously.

'It was determined that an operation would be necessary.

'The dog was emaciated and dehydrated and Mrs Pugsley was told treatment could be between £400 and £1,000.

'She signed a consent form and she then left the dog at the surgery saying she needed to speak to her husband and would return in 10 minutes. She didn’t do that.'

Luke Meyer, defending, told magistrates the Pugsleys were struggling financially at the time and couldn’t afford an operation.

Road to recovery: Paddy was taken away from his owners, who were fined and forced to carry out community service. The Spaniel has since been rehomed by the RSPCA

He said: 'All their dogs had been insured but that insurance had been closed because of financial worries. Had that insurance not lapsed this would never have happened.

'Mr Pugsley owns his own business. On a good year he gets £30,000.

'It’s been hard when they have three children at various ages and a grandchild as well, who rely on Mr Pugsley’s income.'

Mr Pugsley was ordered to pay £1,000 in costs while Mrs Pugsley was charged £60.60. 

The couple were also each given 100 hours community service.

The family, from Dartford, Kent, are allowed to keep their other two dogs, Fred and Bella, but Paddy has now been rehomed.
