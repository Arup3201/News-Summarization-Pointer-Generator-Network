More than 500 Indian migrant workers have died working on construction projects in Qatar in the last two years with the death toll reaching more than 700, since it was announced the Gulf state will host the 2022 World Cup.

Official figures confirmed by the Indian embassy in Doha reveal more than 700 people have lost their lives since the Arab emirate was awarded the tournament in December 2010.

Documents show 233 Indian migrants lost their lives in 2010, 239 in 2011, 237 Indians working in Qatar died in 2012 and another 241 perished last year.

An estimated 1.2million migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Egypt are working to fuel a construction boom in the Arab emirate

A further 24 Indian nationals died in the country in January alone.

In the last two years more than 500 workers have died.

In the last four years that number is 974 Indian workers - 717 of those since Fifa announced the World Cup would be held there in 2022.

The shocking scale of the death toll among those workers fuelling a construction boom in the Arab emirate has prompted human rights groups to urge Fifa to investigate and call for improved working conditions for the estimated 1.2million migrant workers.

Qatar's ministry of labour and social
 affairs told the Guardian: 'Clearly any one death in 
Qatar or anywhere else is one death too many – for the workers, for 
their families, but also for Qataris who welcome guest workers to our 
country to perform valuable jobs.

'We are working to understand the 
causes of these deaths – as these statistics could include a range of 
circumstances including natural causes, and road safety incidents, as 
well as a smaller number of workplace incidents.'

The paper previously reported 382 Nepalese workers have died in Qatar in the last two years.

While the Indian embassy could not provide details as to how people died, Nepalese workers have died as a result of sudden heart failure and workplace accidents.

Jim Murphy, the shadow international development secretary, said: 'Preparations for the 2022 World Cup cannot go on like this – the trickle of worrying reports from the construction sites of Qatar has become a torrent.'

He said some of the practices taking place in the country are tantamount to forced labour, with fears the death toll could reach into the thousands if no action is taken.

Following the revelations about the number of Nepalese deaths the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee said 
while construction directly related to the World Cup had yet to start it
 was committed to providing proper treatment for workers.

A statement said: 'Like everyone 
viewing the video and images, and reading the accompanying texts, we are
 appalled by the findings presented in The Guardian’s report.

'There is no excuse for any worker in Qatar, or anywhere else, to be treated in this manner.

'The
 health, safety, well-being and dignity of every worker that contributes
 to staging the 2022 FIFA World Cup is of the utmost importance to our 
committee and we are committed to ensuring that the event serves as a 
catalyst toward creating sustainable improvements to the lives of all 
workers in Qatar.'

A hearing at the European parliament last week heard representations from human rights groups, Fifa and other parties, after a resolution was passed last year calling for action on the issue.

Critics have called for an overhaul of the kafala system, which ties workers to their employers, and closer control of the construction companies involved.

The International Trade Union Confederation has warned up to 4,000 workers could die before the tournament kicks off in 2022 if nothing is done.

A damning report by Amnesty International late last year revealed workers were being forced to endure 12-hour days.

They faced working in searing temperatures with squalid, overcrowded living quarters.

They come from India, Nepal, Pakistan, Iran, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Egypt.

It has been estimated that the Gulf state will spend £123billion on infrastructure in the next four years.
