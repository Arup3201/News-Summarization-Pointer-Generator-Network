But police say the man was killed when his own gun discharged, hitting him in the head and neck.

Further details on how the shooting occurred have not been disclosed.

The victim, identified only as a Chesterfield man, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The father apparently was not injured. 

Police say the men were hunting Canada geese (above, file picture) on their own when the accident happened

Authorities say the two men were hunting by themselves and had Canada goose decoys spread out in front of their blind.

They said both men were properly licensed to hunt the birds.

West Windsor Police and the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office are investigating the incident. 

An autopsy is scheduled for next week.
