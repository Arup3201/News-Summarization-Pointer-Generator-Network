A haunting image emerged today showing one of the suspected Boston bombers lurking right behind eight-year-old Martin Richard moments before apparently planting the explosive that killed him.

The suspect, named today as 19-year-old Dzhokhar A Tsarnaev, is seen just feet away from the youngster holding a rucksack believed to contain one of two bombs which killed three and injured 176 others.

Martin had been waiting to give his father a big hug to congratulate him for finishing the race, but never got the chance as the twin blasts ripped through the city centre.

Pictures and CCTV images released in the aftermath of the explosions show how Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev brazenly mingled with the crowds so they could watch the terror unfold before their eyes.

The astonishing picture emerged as police and SWAT teams launched a city-wide manhunt today after Dzhokhar went on the run following a fierce firefight with police that left his Tamerlan dead with multiple gunshot wounds.

Blurry CCTV images show the men 
walking in single file toward the finishing line of the race eastward 
along Boylston Street at 14.37pm, approximately 13 minutes before the 
explosions.

Investigators were looking at the men
 for some period of time before deciding to make the footage public to 
be sure they could be labelled as suspects, a source said.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, originally called suspect one, was dressed in a black baseball cap and khaki-colored trousers.

He is seen around five paces ahead of
 his brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, dubbed initially as suspect two, who is 
wearing a white baseball cap backwards, with a grey hoody underneath a 
black coat black pants.

In grabs taken from video, the pair 
do not talk to each other, but move in the same direction with backpacks
 hanging off their shoulders.

The footage shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 
place down his backpack at the scene of the second explosion just in 
front of the Forum restaraunt near to where Martin Richard was standing 
and then move back down Boylston Street in a westward direction.

Video of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev planting 
his device exists, but the FBI has chosen not to release it because were
 the media to repeatedly show the suspects leaving the bomb, it might 
cause some people to overreact if they came into contact with them.

Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are believed to be legal immigrants to the U.S., from the Russian region of Chechnya which has been plagued by an Islamic insurgency stemming from separatist wars.

Dzhokhar was born in Kyrgyzstan, according to NBC. His brother Tamerlan was reportedly born in Russia.

The brothers are believed to have moved to America with their family in 2002 or 2003.

The 19-year-old, who attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, is an amateur wrestling champion who holds a Massachusetts driving licence.

The older brother Tamerlan attended Bunkerhill Community College and was studying to become an engineer but took a year off to pursue boxing.

A friend of the brothers told CNN that he had known them since 2006 and they were 'normal kids' who partied and occasionally smoked.

The father of the suspects said that his son Dzhokhar is a smart and accomplished young man. Anzor Tsarnaev spoke by telephone from the Russian city of Makhachkala on Friday.

Anzor Tsarnaev said: 'My son is a true angel. Dzhokhar is a second-year medical student in the U.S.

'He is such an intelligent boy. We expected him to come on holidays here.'

Tamerlan Tsarnaev is captured moving 
through the marathon crowd toward the finish line and scene of the first
 blast, without his brother suspect two who had disappeared from police 
view.

A image later emerged of Dzhokhar 
Tsarnaev calmly walking away from the scene of carnage as runners and 
spectators fleeing in panic.

The picture taken by Florida 
businessman David Green came just hours after the FBI lodged an 
appeal to identify two suspects behind the attacks that killed three and
 injured over 180.

According to FBI sources who have 
spoken to CNN, still unreleased footage reveals that Tamerlan Tsarnaev 
also stayed to watch the devastation.

Hours after the images were made 
public, the pair killed an MIT police officer and hurled explosives at 
police in a car chase and gun battle overnight that left Tamerlan 
Tsarnaev dead and Dzhokhar on the run.

Tamerlan reportedly had a bomb 
strapped to his chest when he was killed while he and his brother robbed
 a 7-Eleven, minutes earlier.

Authorities in Boston suspended all 
mass transit and warned close to 1 million people in the entire city and
 some of its suburbs to stay indoors as they pursued Dzhokhar, who is 
believed to have explosives strapped to his body.

Businesses were asked not to open. People waiting at bus and subway stops were told to go home. From
 Watertown to Cambridge, police SWAT teams, sharpshooters and FBI agents
 with armored vehicles surrounded various buildings as police 
helicopters buzzed overhead.

'We
 believe this man to be a terrorist,' said Boston Police Commissioner Ed
 Davis. 'We believe this to be a man who's come here to kill people.'

SWAT teams later surrounded a house in Watertown following a massive rush of police vehicles through the area.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev posted online he will 'kill everyone because we killed his brother', according to a dispatcher in Watertown.

Two people have been taken into custody at the home in Cambridge where the brothers grew up but are not considered suspects.

The home is surrounded by FBI and a bomb squad van is on the scene.
