A woman who lost her leg after the Boston Marathon bombings said goodbye to 2014 by walking for the first time.

Rebekah DiMartino, 27, had her left limb amputated in November as 17 operations and 19 months of physio failed to get her back on her feet.

Finally, on Wednesday, the beaming mother-of-one, from Katy, Texas, shared a video on Facebook of her first steps.

She plans to run the Boston Marathon in April 2015.

Incredible: Rebekah DiMartino took her first steps on a prosthetic leg leg night 20 months after the bombings

Ecstatic: The mother-of-one screamed with excitement as she walked with her son, left, and mother, right

'I am standing! Ahh!!' Ms DiMartino screamed in the hallway of OPA Prosthetics in Bellaire as KHOU filmed the momentous event.

'This is me walking, I have not walked in so long!'

Ms DiMartino was with her son Noah, now seven, and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring 270.

All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg.

She had undergone 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, and suffered a serious bone infection. 

New chapter: She underwent surgery to amputate the leg in November after 17 failed operations 

Plans: Seven-year-old Noah said he is excited that his mom can now run races with him

Present: Ms DiMartino's mother has embroidered this sleeve for the prosthetic leg for this year's marathon

Although she had been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year.

Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'.

'The day that I made the decision to chop it off is the best thing I have ever done for myself, because I was letting go of what was holding me back,' she told KHOU.

'You don't realize how many little blessings are in your life that you don't really even pay attention to because they're just expected.' 

Decision: Ms DiMartino shocked many when she jokingly said goodbye to her left leg in November

Struggle: Here she is pictured with now-husband Pete at a Red Sox game months after the incident

Family: Ms DiMartino, Noah and Pete are looking forward to a 2015 of progress and milestones

Sharing the video of her first steps on Facebook, Ms DiMartino wrote: 'So look what I did today... Happy New Year!!! 2014 has GOT TO GO!!!!!' 

Her mother has now embroidered a special pink and black prosthetic leg that reads 'blessed', ready for April's marathon.

And her son Noah said he is 'just excited that she gets to run races with me and play with me now'. 

Ms DiMartino added that she will not be paying any attention to the upcoming trial of bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as she works to rebuild her life. 

'It doesn't matter what happens, it's not my judgment to make and it also doesn't change anything that's happened to me.'
