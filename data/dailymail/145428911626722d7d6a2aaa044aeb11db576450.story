A father whose wife succumbed to cancer before she could meet their daughter, who was being carried by a surrogate, has revealed Hollywood execs approached him to make a film about their lives - but he turned them away.

Nate Yoho's heart-wrenching story hit headlines across the world after his daughter Caralyn was born on November 26 last year, four month's after the death of her mother, Laura, on July 23.

But when Yoho, from Des Moines, Iowa, got a call from someone wanting to make a movie about their lives, he passed it up.

'I just need the time to live my life,' 
he told the De Moines Register of his decision. 'It was very strange. People were telling us how touched and 
inspired they were by this story, and I realized they were talking about
 my life. It was strange. I needed to get some distance from that.'

Now he is focusing on moving forward with his six-month-old daughter, who was carried by Laura's best friend in the ultimate show of friendship.

After his wife's death, the 31-year-old dad started a home training business and has now set up his own gym, CrossFit in Des Moines.

On Saturday, he'll take part in the Head for the Cure 5K on Sunday to raise money for brain cancer research and treatment.

'It's
 a way to keep Laura's memory alive,' Yoho said. 'She was the runner
 in the family. Brain cancer is the deadliest cancer, but it's so 
underfunded. If I can do a little bit to help with that, I'm happy.'

Yoho met Laura Brammeier, a personal trainer, in 2007 at Aspen Athletic Club on Merle Hay Road.

The couple, who shared a passion for fitness, fast fell in love and in 2010, he proposed to her - at the end of a run.

Laura, 20, first learned that she had brain tumors after passing out at a gym in 2010, a few weeks after the couple got engaged.

Originally doctors thought she had suffered a stroke, but as the symptoms persisted the couple sought a second opinion.

She was diagnosed with a brain tumor and even when they were removed in surgery, they returned.

But she never showed any signs of giving up, and the couple wed in 2011.

Laura had eggs frozen before starting 
treatment and, when the couple decided they were ready for a baby, her 
best friend Kara Stetson offered to act as a surrogate.

Kara previously said: 'I just felt so happy that there was something I could do for her family and his family, and selfishly for me, to keep a part of Laura alive on this Earth.

'Laura and I are very close so I think it came easy to both of us, the idea.'

Laura died, peacefully, shortly after having her baby shower.

Four months later, Caralyn was born and Nate stayed with Kara's family for a few days as he settled into his role as a dad.

'Caralyn's birth was certainly up and down,' he told the Des Moines Register. 'I wish my wife was here but the joy of having [Caralyn] here, I know she wouldn't want me to be sad.'

While still grieving for his wife, Nate said he was able to look forward, thanks to his daughter.

'Part of it's having a little bit of my wife back ... I can see her when my daughter smiles,' he said.
