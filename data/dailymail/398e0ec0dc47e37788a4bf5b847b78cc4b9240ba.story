An Illinois woman and her family got more surprises than they bargained for this Christmas - an accidental gift from none other than the Obamas.

Alane Church, from Wadsworth, north of Chicago, received a box of presents from her brother-in-law on New Year's Eve. The package, intended for Christmas, was a week late and when her husband opened it Wednesday morning,heÂ  found it was in 'major disarray.'

But the damaged box came with a 
surprise: A gift addressed to Sasha and Malia's godmother and her 
husband, signed 'Barack, Michelle + the girls.'

'The gifts were broken open. Parts of the old box were in this toilet paper box that the post office repackaged, and in the bottom of the box was this extra gift,' Church told TODAY Thursday.

'We were reading the tag, trying to figure out where this came from. It was opened, so we then discovered this was a very personal gift to Mama Kaye.'

Eleanor 'Mama Kaye' Wilson is a close friend of the Obama family and godmother to Sasha and Malia.

Happy: Church, pictured, tracked down Wilson and learned that the godmother receives a photo book of the Obama girls each year

The gift was a personalized book of photographs, like those made on the photo-sharing site Shutterfly, Church said.

After receiving the gift in the mail, Church uploaded a photo of the wrapped present on Facebook.

In a comment she wrote: 'Ok this is crazy!!!! We finally received Tom's brothers Christmas box from NY.... It can (sic) damaged and with an extra gift!!! All the packages were opened and tossed in a toilet paper box!!!! We got the Presidents Gift!!!!!!!! What to do.......? Wow!!!!'

The handwriting on the self-adhesive gift tag read: 'To Mama Kaye + Papa Wellington. From Barack, Michelle + the girls.'

'It's very special. Private moments of their year of 2013 together,' she told Today.

After learning who the gift's intended recipient was, Church tracked Wilson down and phoned her. Wilson explained to her that the Obama daughters make her a memory book every year.

The cover of the book features a photo of Malia Obama smiling, but Church declined to show the pictures inside to the morning show anchors.

'We are sort of wanting to keep it private for Mama Kaye,' she said, adding that she planned to send the book to Mama Kaye today.

Hopefully, the post office gets it right this time.
