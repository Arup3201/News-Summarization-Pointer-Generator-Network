Charged: Victalina Mendoza Cruz, 24, seen here, was arrested on Thursday in connection with a boyfriend's two-year-old son's death on February 6

A pregnant mother of two who admitted throwing her boyfriend's son on the floor, then leaving him unsupervised in a bathtub has been charged with injury to a child after the toddler died.

Victalina Mendoza Cruz, 24, who is seven months pregnant, was arrested on Thursday in connection with the two-year-old boy's death  on February 6 at her boyfriend's house in Louisiana.

Cruz had been taking care of the boy since January 11, when her live-in boyfriend left for work in Louisiana.

But after the child was found dead, she told investigators a story that simply did not add up. She initially said that she fed the toddler and then put him in a half-full bath tub while she fed her other children.

Then, when she came back to the bathroom 10 minutes later, she found him face down in the water and called 911, according to The Houston Chronicle. 

However, a doctor who treated the boy at Texas Children's Hospital said he showed signs of brutal abuse.

He had bruises on his eyes,  a bruise on the left hip, a patch of skin missing from the back of his head a bruise to the left shoulder, and a scar on his lower back.

The doctor also noted that he was  malnourished and was not expected to live.

After this evidence was collected, Cruz was questioned again about the events of that day.

This time, she told police a completely different story and admitted she fed the boy but he didn't eat much, so she told him to get into the bath tub.

When he began to cry she shoved him from the back and he fell forward into a door frame, hitting his face causing injury to his body.

Defense attorney David Bries said: 'She is seven months pregnant so we'll revisit the issue [that she cannot have contact with kids] again in a couple of months'

The boy continued crying and Cruz told police that she picked him up by the arm, slapped him and threw him on the floor. 

She then picked up the quiet child and put him in the bath tub where she found him face down in the water 10 minutes later.

A forensic pathologist at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Science said a skull fracture to the back of the boy's head and blood in the skull cavity were consistent with blunt force trauma caused by striking a door frame or the floor.

Cruz, who is free on $50,000 bail, appeared in court on Friday in the 209th State District Court. 

She cannot have contact with children under the age of 18. 

Defense attorney David Bries told KPRC Houston: 'Now she is seven months pregnant so we'll revisit that issue again in a couple of months.'
