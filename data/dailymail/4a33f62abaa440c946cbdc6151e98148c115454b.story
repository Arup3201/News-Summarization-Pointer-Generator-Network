Overdose: David Smith, 67, took his own life with a lethal drug cocktail the day he was due to stand trial for child abuse offences

A former BBC driver and prolific paedophile killed himself on the day he was due to stand trial on new child abuse claims, an inquest heard yesterday.

David Smith, chauffeur to celebrities during the 1980s, left a note apologising to his mother and asking to be left to die in 'peace and comfort' after locking himself in his flat and taking an overdose.

Police discovered his body after he failed to turn up at Southwark Crown Court last October where he was due to face a jury after being the first person charged under Operation Yewtree - the investigation begun after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile.

The 67-year-old convicted child sex abuser was accused of two counts of indecent assault, two of indecency and a fifth charge of rape involving a 12-year-old boy in 1984.

On one occasion he was said to have assaulted the boy at the BBC studios at White City in West London.

DC Ben Markam, from Operation Yewtree, said when they arrived at his flat in Lewisham, South-East London, a note was on the locked front door with instructions on who to contact to open it.

After obtaining a warrant, the detective forced the door open and found the body in his bedroom.

It was cold and stiff, as if rigamortis had set in, and there was no pulse, Southwark Coroner's Court heard.

Empty packets of pills and a half empty bottle of whisky were also found in the flat, as was a note.

It read: 'If still alive allow me to die in peace and comfort, no organs no transplant.' It concluded by saying sorry to his 95-year-old mother and two other people believed to be relatives.

DC Markham said Smith's flat was dated but neat and tidy with his money and personal possessions carefully arranged on his bedside table.

Pathologist Dr Peter Jerreat told the inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court that the cause of death was drug intoxication.

'He had been drinking, but not a significant amount,' he added. 'There were no signs of injury.'

Senior Coroner Dr Andrew Harris concluded that the case contained all the 'ingredients' to prove he killed himself by 'deliberately taking a fatal combination' of drugs.

Smith had denied abusing the 12-year-old boy, between June 1 and July 21, 1984.

He was said to have met his victim at a swimming pool, invited him back to his flat where he abused him.

He also took the boy on a visit to the BBC studios at White City. During the journey the boy claimed that he was assaulted.

Court documents from the criminal case said there was 'no evidence to suggest any connection' between Smith and Savile, though the former 'was contracted to work as a driver for the BBC in the relevant period', it added.

Smith was a prolific sex offender whose first conviction was in 1966. He had 22 convictions for sexual offences against young boys.

After his death, another man who had an abuse claim pending against Smith separate from the scheduled trial said his death had cheated him and other alleged victims of seeing justice done.

The man said he was 'bitterly disappointed' and 'angry and disappointed' that he would not face trial.

A BBC spokesman said: 'We have not found a record of David Smith being employed by or working for the BBC.'
