A 79-year-old family-run underwear firm backed by retail guru Mary Portas has gone into administration with the loss of 33 jobs.

Headen & Quarmby was chosen by Miss Portas to make underwear for her Kinky Knickers brand, sold in high street shops such as M&S.

In a 2012 TV series she documented the launch of the venture, which aimed to revive the ailing UK textile industry which has been decimated by the availability of cheap imports.

Business was booming at the Headen and
 Quarmby factory in Middleton, Greater Manchester, after it was featured
 in a three-part Channel Four series Mary’s Bottom Line.

She
 was charged with reviving British manufacturing - and to prove that 
homegrown enterprise and workers could create high quality clothing.

Millions
 watched as eight raw apprentices were taken on board, overseen by Lynn 
Birbeck, whose family founded the factory in 1935.

The
 resulting ‘kinky knickers’ range was a resounding success and helped 
prove Portas’ ethos that quality, homegrown products could compete on 
the high street against cheap foreign imports.

But now, less than two years later, the factory has closed and the firm has gone into administration, with the loss of 33 jobs.

Bosses pointed to a lack of pre-Christmas orders from ‘key customers’ for the closure.

Until recently the experiment was said to be a success for the Middleton company.

The
 colourful lace lingerie was said to be in such demand since going on 
sale in early 2012 at stores including Boots, House of Fraser and online
 fashion retailers, an initial production run for 5,000 led to orders 
for 45,000.

Eight 
apprentices were taken on originally, paid for by TV production company 
Endemol for the first nine months. And more were taken on as the factory
 doubled their workforce to meet demand.

One employee, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘It has come as such a shock, we had no idea the business was in trouble.’

BDO
 LLP business restructuring partners, Kerry Bailey and Patrick Lannagan,
 were appointed Joint Administrators over Headen & Quarmby on 15 
January 2014, a spokesman said.

Kerry
 Bailey, BDO business restructuring partner said: ‘The Company employs 
33 staff and regrettably, it has been necessary to make all employees 
redundant.

‘The Joint 
Administrators are currently investigating options to recommence trading
 and fulfil customer orders, with a view to affecting a sale of the 
business as a going concern.

‘A
 drop in post-Christmas orders from key customers and a decline in sales
 volumes has significantly affected the business and resulted in a 
deterioration of its working capital position. However, we are doing 
everything we can to try to secure a future for the business, and we are
 hopeful of securing a sale.

‘To
 that end, the administration team would welcome approaches from 
commercial parties interested in acquiring the business or assets.’

Bad sales: Management blamed 'poor Christmas sales' for the closure

Middleton knicker factory Headen and Quarmby’s manufacturing had been mothballed ahead of Portas’s TV show.

Speaking
 at the time of the show Portas said: ‘The reaction has been amazing. 
Now the plan is to export and I’m hoping we’ll have another two 
factories making the knickers.

‘I’ve
 already had to take on an additional two apprentices to cope with 
demand. There is a real appetite for British-made clothing in this 
country.

‘I sincerely believe that people want to buy British, but that choice was taken away from them.’

Speaking in 2012 MD David Moore said the knickers were so popular his staff were struggling to cope with demand.

In
 December 2012 a fourth instalment of the show was broadcast to show the
 progress on the project. It included how the team had to scale up 
production to cope with the huge demand for the frilly knickers, which 
were being sold for a pricey but affordable £10.

Ahead
 of the Channel Four show Headen & Quarmby were a family firm 
established 70 years ago who had to send production overseas to make 
ends meet. Only a tiny section of their huge factory on the outskirts of
 Manchester was being used with rows of neglected sewing machines under 
covers.
