Abbey Clancy has been voted as the owner of the best legs in showbiz.

The model, who is the face (and legs) of Veet and Scholl, also scooped third place in the best feet awards, while TV presenter Holly Willoughby topped the pedi poll, coming second in the best legs category.

Kelly Brook, Tess Daley, Emma Willis and Cat Deeley were also named as having fabulous pins and tootsies.

Perfect pins: British women named Abbey as having the best legs in showbiz

The survey by Veet found that although British women admire the petite scouser’s long legs they are shy when it comes to showing off their own.

Hairy legs, pale skin and hard skin on feet particularly leave British women unwilling to make the most of the sun and the survey found that almost half of women will cover up their legs by wearing jeans instead of skirts.

And it’s 
not much better on the feet front; almost half of women will opt for 
pumps instead of sandals because they’re embarrassed to let anyone see 
the hard skin on their feet and cracked heels. Only 15 per cent of women
 think that their feet look good in a pair of sandals.

Summer ready: Abbey says she gets the most compliments about her legs when she's kept up her grooming routine

Abbey
 says: ‘It’s no wonder women keep their legs and feet covered up when 
they feel unprepared to bare their skin. I know I tend to hide in a pair
 of skinny jeans and ballet pumps when I’ve neglected my legs and feet.

‘However, I get the most compliments and
 feel best about myself when I have taken the time to ensure my legs are
 smooth and hair-free and that my feet are well cared for.’

It is cost that is putting most people off getting summer-ready, with over three quarters of women saying the price of treatments at salons 
is an issue. Feeling embarrassed and lack of time are also reasons women
 are deciding to take grooming into their own hands.

‘As a model I have learnt how to take care of my body and make sure it’s always looking its best’, says Abbey.

‘I feel most confident when I’ve carried out my beauty basics such as waxing and foot care. It’s not just about how great your legs and feet look, but how you feel once they are prepped and ready to bare as soon as the sun comes out.'

'Any mum with a full time job knows that fitting in time to do even the simple things like going to the gym and shops can be a struggle, never mind finding the time to visit a salon. That’s why products like Veet EasyWax that are quick and easy to use at home are a god send.'

Abbey has certainly been busy lately, revealing her new range of figure-hugging summer dresses for Matalan on Wednesday.

Following the success of her AW13 collection, 28-year-old Abbey was invited back by Matalan to design a summer dress collection.

With all this campaigning, she deserves her holiday in Dubai, where she is currently sunning herself with her footballer husband Peter Crouch.
