A coroner has warned of the ‘dire consequences’ of underage drinking after a boy aged 15 froze to death yards from his home.

Leon Cudworth and his friends visited a pub, then bought bottles of vodka and other drinks and went on to a house party.

After consuming large amounts of alcohol, they visited a bar. Leon was last seen at midnight, and CCTV shows him walking unsteadily near home at 1.20am. He was ‘delirious’ with cold and drink, and staggered past his house, an inquest heard.

Leon Cudworth (pictured) was found dead on February 15, just yards from his home, after he is believed to have succumbed to hypothermia following a night out with pals

A neighbour woke to hear him shouting ‘Dad, Dad!’ and called police, but by the time two officers carried out a search, Leon was silent. At the inquest, it emerged one of the pair did not have a working torch.

At 7.30am Leon, who had also smoked cannabis, was found lying on his back in an alley 35 yards from his front door. He had been wearing a flimsy jacket, a T-shirt, jeans and shoes in the near-freezing weather, and had suffered hypothermia. His back door key was next to his body.

Assistant coroner Lisa Hashmi said: ‘The risks to both young people and adults alike in the misuse of drugs, and alcohol in particular, cannot be over-emphasised.’

She said she hoped ‘word will spread of the very dire consequences’ and that young people would ‘take heed of the tragic circumstances’.

Floral tributes were left at the scene where Leon was found on February this year after telling his dad he was at a wine bar and "wouldn't be long" after speaking with him on the phone

The inquest in Heywood, Greater Manchester, heard Leon promised his father he would be back by midnight on the evening in February.

He met friends aged 16,17 and 18 in a pub in Oldham, bought alcohol at a supermarket and an off-licence, and went to the house party. Leon and a friend moved on to a bar, where they were let in through rear doors. They then visited a McDonald’s, which Leon was seen leaving at midnight.

Neighbours awoke to hear him screaming for his father in the street. Tracy Royal said: ‘He was shouting “Dad, Dad!”. At first I thought it was someone who had been locked out.

‘I did get up. He was crying and sounded tired. I got up again to have a look at about 2.40am . . . but I didn’t see anything. I thought he had got in the house. I felt awful because I could have phoned the police.’

Another neighbour, Sarah Collins, called police and two officers searched the area. PC Steven Norris said he did not look more carefully as only one call was made.

He revealed he did not have a working torch and added: ‘With hindsight we should have extended the search . . . At the time, I thought it was sufficient.’ PC Andrew Peters, who did have a torch, said that his search should have been more thorough.

Pathologist Dr Philip Lumb gave the cause of death as hypothermia and acute alcohol intoxication. He said: ‘The cold can kill within minutes. Hypothermia causes confusion as well.’

Police have spoken to premises that sold alcohol to the friends.

The assistant coroner returned a verdict of accidental death.
