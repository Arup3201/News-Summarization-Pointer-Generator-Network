Universal Studios Hollywood has come under fire for an 'offensive' live action show in which superman is depicted as an outrageously camp gay man.

The 'Halloween Horror Nights' theme includes 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure' during which the two protagonists  - from the cult 1989 film - have to kill witches before they can return home.

But when Superman arrives to help the pair, a witch sprinkles 'fairy dust' on him - transforming him into a camp caricature of a gay man.

But when Superman arrives to help the pair, a witch sprinkles 'fairy dust' on him - transforming him into a camp caricature of a gay man

With a scream of 'fabulous!' the character launches into full camp mode - affecting a lisped voice, limp wrist and removing his shirt and trousers.

Stripped down to just a small pair of underpants, he leaps around the stage blowing kisses and flirts outrageously with Ted. 

According to Vice.com, when Superman faces his nemesis, General Zod, he is told to 'get on his knees', an order that the hero appears to take for a reference to oral sex, and squeals: 'Finally!'

An actor playing Star Trek's George 
Takei, who is gay, then chats up Superman and the pair leave the stage 
to have sex. Takai then turns to the audience and exclaims: 'Time to 
boldly go where no man has gone before.'

It was also said to have included jokes based on racial stereotypes.

The Huffington Post reports that the audience appear to thoroughly enjoy the show - and laugh heartily throughout.

But the show has attracted criticism online for its 'offensive nature' and 'stereotypical attitude'.

Twitter users took to the internet to vent their fury.
