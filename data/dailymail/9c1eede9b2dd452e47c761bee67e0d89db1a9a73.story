Neighbors of The Breakers estate in Newport are suing to stop a $4.2million new welcome center from being built at the site of the historic Vanderbilt mansion.

Even Gloria Vanderbilt, designer and CNN host Anderson Cooper's mother, has objected to the location of the new center, in the grounds of the famous building constructed by her family in the Gilded Age.

The Preservation Society of Newport County want the new center to provide tickets, restrooms and a shop selling sandwiches.

Ms Vanderbilt said: 'People come to experience the fantasy, the wonder and
beauty of that world.

'If the first thing they see upon
entering the gates of this magical kingdom is a new building selling plastic
shrink-wrapped sandwiches, it will forever change their enjoyment of the
visit.'

The neighborhood association filed the lawsuit Friday in Newport Superior Court against the Preservation Society of Newport County, which owns several mansions in this seaside tourist town, operating them as museums.

The Breakers a national historic landmark which includes 70 rooms, is its crown jewel and draws 400,000 visitors annually.

National landmark: A proposal to build a visitors center on the grounds of The Breakers, the Vanderbilt family mansion and national historic landmark, is dividing Newport's preservationists, neighbors

Proposed visitors center:  The Preservation Society says it took painstaking care to have its architects design a structure that would blend into the landscape and incorporate lovely style elements of the 19th century

Sore point: The Vanderbilt familyÂ¿s 'cottage' in Newport, Rhode Island, draws 400,000 visitors a year. A proposal to build a visitors center on the grounds is raising hackles

Modernization: A rendering of the proposed visitors center at the Breakers. Portable toilets are there now

The group wants to build the center 
on the 13-acre grounds of the mansion to provide visitors with services 
including ticketing, accessible restrooms and prepared sandwiches.

The
 neighbors group argues in its lawsuit that the plan violates a number 
of provisions of the city zoning ordinance, including because it is in a
 residential neighborhood and a museum and because it would house what 
the group says is a restaurant. Lawyer Daniel Prentiss argues the zoning
 rules don't allow that.

A spokeswoman for the Preservation society disagreed in a written statement.

'The
 Preservation Society believes the lawsuit is completely without merit 
and we will vigorously defend against it,' society spokeswoman Andrea 
Carneiro said. 'In the meantime, we are moving forward.'

Stunning: The Breakers, named for the breaking Atlantic waves it overlooks, is one of the most popular historic house museums in the United States

Historic: The estate opened in in 1895, during a time when Newport functioned as the nation's summer social capital, and became the crown jewel in a city populated by mansions

Plans: The Preservation Society's plan calls for a 3,700-square-foot building reminiscent of a conservatory to be built inside a grove of trees, where it says it would not be visible from the house or street.

For: The Preservation Society of Newport County, the nonprofit group that owns the 70-room mansion, says the center is badly needed to serve The Breakers' 400,000 annual visitors

The dispute over the welcome center has grown rancorous since the Preservation Society publicly announced the project last year.

The neighbors group and members of the Vanderbilt family, including designer Gloria Vanderbilt, have argued against building the center on the estate's grounds, with several arguing a better location would be directly across the street in a parking lot.

The society says it has explored the alternatives, but none of them are feasible. Building it across the street would take up too many parking spaces and would be too far away from the house, the group has said. Many of the state's influential economic development and tourism officials have lined up in favor of the project.

The National Park Service also weighed in, saying in a letter it was concerned the plan could damage the national historic landmark and asking the group to reconsider.

But a few days later, it retracted the letter and apologized for sending it on the eve of a critical vote by the city's zoning board in January.

The board ultimately gave the project the go-ahead, overturning a decision by the Historic District Commission that found the project was incompatible with local historic standards.

Robert Beaver, who lives near The Breakers and is a member of the neighbors group, said on Monday that the neighbors also plan a separate lawsuit to appeal that zoning board decision.

Against:  Many opponents agree something is needed, but they want it across the street in the parking lot or elsewhere, not on the 13-acre grounds of the property, which they say would be irreparably damaged

History: The Newport homes were They were built during the so-called 'Gilded Age' in American history which was the period roughly from 1877 to the turn of the 20th Century

The 
Breakers, named for the breaking Atlantic waves it overlooks, is one of 
the most popular historic house museums in the United States.

The
 estate opened in in 1895, during a time when Newport functioned as the 
nation's summer social capital, and became the crown jewel in a city 
populated by mansions.

By 
the middle of the 20th century, though, many of the once-splendid homes 
had fallen into disrepair. Some were razed. The Preservation Society was
 formed to save some of those buildings.

Plan: Those who visit The Breakers today must either pay admission at a small ticket booth or at a tent erected on the grounds during warmer months. A new building will allow guests to pay and gather on site but away from the main house

It
 purchased The Breakers from Vanderbilt's descendants in the 1970s and 
today owns 11 properties that collectively receive more than 900,000 
visitors annually.

Wealthy families from New York and Boston built huge houses with sprawling gardens in Newport in which to holiday in the summer and to entertain guests.

They were built during the so-called 'Gilded Age' in American history which was the period roughly from 1877 to the turn of the 20th Century.

Among the families who began to build in Newport in the late 19th and early 20th century, were the very wealthy members of America's east coast high society - including the Vanderbilts, Astors and Wideners.

Glamour: The Marble House was built between 1888 and 1892 for Alva and William Kissam Vanderbilt. Its construction is credited with helping to transform Newport into a holiday destination for America's wealthiest families

Picturesque: Chateau-sur-Mer was built as a French-style villa for William Shepard Wetmore, a merchant in the China trade. It is now open to the public as a museum

The buildings became key symbols of 
status within New York high society, with families trying to outdo each 
other with the expense and beauty of their homes.

The mansions, which were known, ironically perhaps, as 'cottages,' costs tens of thousands of dollars to build (millions of dollars in today's money) and boasted features such as marble floors and fire places, palladian columns, electricity and other luxuries of the time.

Perhaps the finest of these houses was The Breakers which was built in 1895.

The grandiose Marble House, which was built between 1888 and 1892 by the Vanderbilts, is credited with helping to attract other wealthy families to follow suit by building holiday homes in Newport.

Design: Built between 1881 and 1883, The Isaac Bell House, Newport, is considered to be one of the finest Shingle Style houses in the US

Finery: Built between 1898 and 1902, Rosecliff was built by Theresa Fair Oelrichs - a 'silver heiress' from Nevada

Families came to Newport for the social season holding grand parties. However, for all their grandeur, the houses often had relatively few bedrooms, as the guests were expected to have their own property nearby.

Many of the mansions 
were designed by the renowned New York-based architect Richard Morris Hunt, who had a house in Newport himself.

Many of the mansions remain in private use, although a number are now card for by the Preservation Society of Newport County. Others were
 converted into academic buildings for Salve Regina College in the 1930s.
