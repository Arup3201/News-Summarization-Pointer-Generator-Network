Germans are well-known for their love of beer and Chancellor Angela Merkel is no exception.

The German leader has been snapped with a bearded Brisbane local outside the craft beer house Brewski Bar, on Caxton Street in Brisbane, ahead of the G20 on Saturday.

When she arrived back at her hotel, on the same street, the Chancellor crossed the road to mingle with locals and German speakers.

Matt, the owner of Brewski Bar, said when Chancellor Merkel arrived it was like a ‘rockstar’ had turned up.

‘Everyone was screaming and cheering,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

The bar was given no warning that she was coming but the staff had been ‘double guessing who was staying at the hotel’ across the road.

‘The motorcade turned up, they closed the street off and a nice shiny Merc or something rocked up with the German flags on the front. She jumped out of the car and came straight in,’ Matt said.

‘I was standing outside the bar and she shook my hand I said “welcome to Australia” and she said “thank you very much”.’

Matt said despite having 120 types of beer in his bar ‘not one is German’.

Dr Merkel arrived in Brisbane for the meeting of world leaders after a stop over in New Zealand where she also showed her fun side and cooed over a cute kiwi bird at Motutapu Island. 

The kiwi name Whau was held by a Department of Conservation ranger as Chancellor Merkel patted her. 

Chancellor Merkel is staying at the Gambaro Hotel, the newest and only 5-star luxury hotel accommodation in the Suncorp Stadium.

Also out on the town was Mexico's First Lady Angelica Rivera.

The glamorous wife of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto popped out for a drink at Jade Buddha bar in the city centre.

The bar is owned by Phil Hogan, the man who turned down an invite to President Obama's talk at the University of Queensland because his wife of almost 21 years, Michelle, was not invited. 

Mr Hogan told Daily Mail Australia this week: 'I've been in hospitality all my life and have been invited to a lot of things but the number one most important thing in my life is my family.

'I worked out way back a rule that weekends are for family time, I don't go to anything unless my wife is invited.'

Mrs Rivera  reportedly stayed at the bar for two hours.

A photo on the bar's Facebook page was captioned: 'The Mexican First Lady was kind enough to pose for a pic with Phil Hogan while she was here enjoying a glass of moscato & the view.'

Meanwhile, showing no sign of jet lag, British Prime Minister David Cameron stopped by a riverside restaurant in Brisbane for dinner.

The pair later had a business breakfast together and then flew to Canberra, where the British leader gave a special address in the House of Representatives.

Assistant Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll says the security teams that accompany world leaders are well versed in how to keep them safe, and she expected more leaders to get out and about while they are in the city.

'I gather that will happen quite a bit in the next few days. Leaders do want to get out there and talk to the public,' she said.

Also on Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was happy to mingle on the sidelines of his visit to Queensland University of Technology.

And the International Monetary Fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, has been spotted strolling in parts of Brisbane and dining at South Bank.
