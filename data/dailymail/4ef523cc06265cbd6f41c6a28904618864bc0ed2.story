Dozens of volunteers scoured a wooded area in Florida this weekend in a new search for Michelle Parker, a mother-of-three who went missing nearly a year ago.

Ms Parker, 33, of Orlando, 
Florida, was last seen on November 17 dropping her three-year-old twins 
off at her ex-fiancé Dale Smith's home, with whom she had a tumultuous 
relationship.

Smith has been revealed as a suspect in her disappearance, but he is yet to be charged.

Mystery: About 150 volunteers conducted a new search in Lake Nona for Michelle Parker, left, who was last seen in November 2011

Missing: Family members reported Ms Parker missing after she didn't show up for work as a bartender at a local restaurant. Police later found her abandoned Hummer SUV

Ms Parker's disappearance came right after she had discussed her broken relationship with Smith on an episode of The People's Court.

About 150 showed up in Lake Nona on Sunday in a revived search for the woman, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Her father Brad Parker told the Orlando Sentinel that some bones were found during the search, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether they belonged to a person or an animal.

The Orlando Police Department was notified about the remains, and will conduct an investigation.

In a statement posted to the 
'Michelle Parker Missing Person' Facebook page, her family said: 'Today I
am thankful for the over 140 people who showed up to search for 
Michelle. Some close friends and family, others I have never met but 
wanted to help.

Spotlight: Ms Parker was seen squaring off against Smith on The People's Court hours before she 
went missing. Mr Smith sued his ex after she threw away a 
$5,000 engagement ring

'I 
never thought I would ever have to spend a day in my life cutting 
through woods searching for a loved one with a machete. We are cut, 
scratched, bleeding, sweaty, exhausted, dirty and sun burned... And I 
can't wait to do it again. While we didn't get our answer just yet, we 
covered miles of ground. Every step in knowing where she isn't, is a 
step closer in closing the gap to where she IS.

Mr Smith 
was dishonourably discharged from the Marines in 2003 following a 
reported string of court martials and military convictions for drug 
possession.

They had a 
'violent' history and he was charged with domestic battery, 
according to reports. She filed a domestic violence case and restraining
order against him in 2009, ABC New reported last year.

In
her filing she said he 'smashed the passenger side window in my 
SUV' and 'took car seats out and threw them in the road'. She also 
alleged that he yelled to her: 'Your day is coming.'

'He
gets pretty malicious and vindictive,' she said of him on The People's 
Court, 'and he's a mean person especially when he's been drinking.' But 
her restraining order request was refused.

Searching: Despite their history, family members say Mr Smith is cooperating with police and that they don't believe he is involved in his ex-fiance's disappearance

Lack
of evidence in her claims of hostility was cited. Police have said that
he is not a suspect in her disappearance. However, new details about 
their tumultuous relationship are now surfacing.

Her friend Angela Launer told ABC Mr Smith was known to abandon her in out of the way places.

'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself,' Ms Launer, 34, said, describing their relationship as 'rocky' and 'tense'.

Meanwhile her mother said her daughter was humiliated by her appearance on the reality TV show.

Her
distraught family have revealed the impact of appearing on the 
controversial show, which aired just hours before she disappeared.

Yvonne
Stewart told ABC when her daughter returned from filming in the summer 
she said: 'It was the most humiliating experience of my life. I don't 
even ever want to see it. I wish I had never gone.'

Dirty laundry: The People's Court Episode with Mr Smith and Ms Parker was promoted as 'Roller Coaster Romance Derails!' and included the pair airing the dirty laundry about their relationship

Ms Parker is the
mother of an 11-year-old son and two three-year-old twins she had with Smith.

The
couple fought it out over the lawsuit he filed claiming she lost her 
$5,000 engagement ring when she threw it at him in a fight at a Hilton 
hotel during a science fiction convention.

On the show, Judge Marilyn Milian tells the couple: 'You're like drugs to each other. You're addicted to each other.'

She
decried their volatile relationship, saying that each of them needs to 
move on from their on-again-off again romance that has lasted since 
2006.

She added that the pair needs to 'grow up' and 'move on' for the sake of the three-year-old twins they have together.

Ms
Parker's family reported her missing when 
she didn't show up for work at 8pm at The Barn restaurant, where she is a
bartender.
