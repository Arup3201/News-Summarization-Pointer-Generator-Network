For months its brutality has been documented in propaganda designed to frighten the world into considering its terrorist cause. 

But footage of life under the rule of ISIS has revealed the lasting effects of the group's barbarity, with women and children strolling past the decapitated bodies of Syrian soldiers in the city of Raqqa without giving them a second glance. 

Unaffected by the sight of the decaying corpses, civilians do not even acknowledge the men's impaled heads positioned on fences across the city which has become a recruiting hub for extremists.

Another day of terror at the hands of ISIS: Civilians walk past bodies lying across the pavements in Raqqa seemingly unaffected by the horrors being carried out 

The decapitated bodies of Syrian soldiers were left scattered in the streets of Raqqa by ISIS fighters 

Heads impaled on spikes look down on the city's pavements in a constant reminder of the group's barbarity 

It is among the most gruesome hallmarks of life under the group's control since jihadis stormed President Assad's army and took hold earlier this year. 

The video, filmed in July, offers a rare glimpse into civilian life since ISIS launched a campaign of terror against Syria and Iraq. 

Scattered corpses lie on pavements and roads with some tied to fencing, their severed heads stuck between their legs, as black-clad ISIS fighters patrol the streets.

In other parts of the town preachers urge children, with black balaclavas disguising their innocent faces, to disobey their parents and join the militant group. 

'I swear to god we will see a caliphate based on the prophecy. Be with the state or you will be the ones who get killed,' a man threatened one group of silent youngsters to a backdrop of the group's ominous flag. 

While the corpses of President Assad's troops will be removed within three days, the threat of death is enduring for everyone else, one civilian revealed. 

'They hate to see the murder but they cannot speak because of fear,' one civilian living in the city told MailOnline.

The corpses were removed within three days though it is not known where they were taken, a civilian revealed 

By-passers do not raise an eyebrow at the horrific scenes with ISIS fighters patrolling the city's streets 

As American and Arab forces continue to bomb ISIS strongholds across Syria and Kurdish forces sustain a ferocious defence of the Turkish border, Raqqa remains under the sinister rule of extremists. 

Among the most prolific images of terrorist fighters are those taken in the city which has been rendered a 'ghost town' by fanatics patrolling the streets in black uniforms and balaclavas. 

Footage of young soldiers brandishing machine guns and walking in single file emerged online as early as January this year, while the civilian website Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently offers a backlog of the atrocities residents have been subjected to. 

Just this month a 17-year-old was crucified in the town's centre, alleged to have taken photographs of jihadis in action. 

Several weeks ago photographs emerged of ISIS fighters splashing around in hotel swimming pools and dining in expensive restaurants while the town's hospitals shut down and children were banished to training camps. 

Meanwhile residents home have been ravaged by what effects the airstrikes have had on the area. 

'Our city will be destroyed, we will pay with our blood,' one resident said, adding: 'It will be a very big war, and in big wars, the civilian will pay.'

Of the cameraman who captured the disturbing images, he said: 'It is possible the Daash (ISIS) (will) kill him on this.' 

Earlier this month another civilian revealed how extremists were living like royalty in the town while ordinary residents plunged further into poverty.  

Using a pseudonym he revealed how jihadis had taken control of the town's food supplies and marched through its mostly deserted streets waving the group's flag.

Since the haunting footage was taken in summer, insiders say the city has quietened with the fear of airstrikes at the hands of American and Arab forces imminent.

Once heaving with rows of ISIS soldiers, a member of the group, Raqqa Is Being Silently Slaughtered, likened its streets to a ghost town in a recent online post. 

American and Arab forces have launched a series of airstrikes on areas they consider ISIS strongholds including the border town of Kobane, where Kurdish fighters continue to wage bloody warfare on the group.

Life has become easier for fighters in Raqqa under Islamic State rule, with jihadists rewarded with higher salaries and bonuses while civilians plunge further into poverty 

Dozens have been buried in the Turkish town of Suruc as the battle for Kobane, once considered an ISIS stronghold, rages on. 

At the beginning of the month jihadis approached the town from the desert, planting their flag on Tilsehir hill. 

Yesterday, after weeks of bloody conflict and devastating air strikes, it was replaced by a yellow Kurdish flag in one of the first signs of hope for fighters defending the border.

But with so many refugees having fled the grasp of fanatics in recent months, dozens have died alone with no traces of family available to their comrades.  

An estimated 1.6million refugees have crossed the border into Turkey since fanatics took hold of more towns earlier this year.  

Tilsehir Hill, where the black flag of ISIS stood triumphantly for weeks, was obliterated by an American-Arab airstrike earlier this week
