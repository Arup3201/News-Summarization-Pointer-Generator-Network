Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs may be serving a life-plus-20-year sentence in a Texas prison, but his grip on most of his 10,000 followers doesn't appear to be lessening.

Some former insiders say he's imposing even more rigid requirements on church members.

A number of marriages have been dissolved and families split up as Jeffs works from his prison cell to reshape his Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, according to Willie Jessop, a former FLDS spokesman.

Since about mid-November, Jeffs' 
brother, Lyle Jeffs, has been conducting personal interviews with 
members to determine their worthiness under the stringent new orders.

The inquiries range from whether 
members are saying daily prayers to whether they have carnal desires or 
'dwell in the wickedness of evil dross of this generation.'

Jeffs recently lost his phone 
privileges at his prison in East Texas after it was discovered he 
preached to his followers from behind bars on Christmas Day, in 
violation of prison rules.

He is currently serving a life sentence  for sexually assaulting two girls he wed as spiritual brides when they were 12 and 14 years old at his sect's Texas ranch.

Allegations surfaced earlier this 
month that underage girls are still secretly being held by Jeffs' 
followers for sexual purposes.

Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said at the time he intended to look into the claim the young girls are being held.

He said: 'I believe there's still a 
half-dozen to a dozen places around the country where girls are still 
being held. And I'm very concerned about that.

'The worry is that there are still 
children being trafficked in potential sexual crimes or being held for 
the prophet for that purpose.

'We don't know exactly. But that is a concern and that is something I intend to look into.'

It also emerged that he banned sex and voided a number of marriages from behind bars and is said to have already kicked one member who dared to sleep with his own wife.

He allegedly recently declared that all marriages are void until he can return and 'seal' them.

'He has predicted that the walls in 
the prison where he's at will fall and crumble,' Joni Holm, who has many
relatives in the polygamous sect, told the Desert News.

CNN reported that one member who 
admitted to violating the proclamation has been excommunicated -- the 
harshest punishment for a member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

In an effort to maintain control of 
his congregation of 10,000, Jeffs has imposed other harsh rules, 
including banning children's toys, trampolines, bikes and ATVs.

Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints, which teaches that for a man to be among 
the select in heaven he must have at least three wives, is estimated to 
have 10,000 followers in North America.

Jeffs
was hospitalized for nearly a month earlier this year for going on a 
fast that former sect members described as an attempt to communicate to 
followers across North America of their need to sacrifice on his behalf.

He is now back in the prison system, where he receives special protection as a high-profile offender.

Texas
prison inmates are ordered to adhere to a strict set of rules in using 
telephones, and are typically allowed to call only ten people on an 
approved visitation list, Clark said.

Jeffs is in protective custody, among the most restrictive forms of imprisonment in Texas.

He's alone in his cell daily and isn't involved in any work programs.

Protective custody inmates, and there are only 85 of them in the 156,000-inmate Texas prison system, are isolated because of serious, direct or proven threats against them.

A month after his conviction, Jeffs filed a handwritten motion seeking a new trial.

He alleges his religious freedoms were violated by the courts, an argument he also tried to make while defending himself during his trial.
