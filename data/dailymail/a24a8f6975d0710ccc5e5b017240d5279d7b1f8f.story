It is not a sight that will sit easily with Andy Murray.

This is the hunky Spaniard he faces in today’s quarter-final –and his rival’s toned physique has not gone unnoticed in the Murray family.

For among Fernando Verdasco’s many female admirers is none other than the Scot’s mother Judy, who is widely known to have a soft spot for the pin-up 24 years her junior who will go head-to-head with her son on Centre Court.

Fernando Verdasco posed for Cosmopolitan to raise awareness of male cancer for the Everyman appeal - and has attracted an army of female fans

With his perfect tan and muscled physique, there is no doubt Verdasco must feel confident about his body after posing nude for Cosmopolitan to raise awareness of male cancer for the Everyman appeal.

He first came to the attention of Mrs Murray, 53, in Monte Carlo two years ago, when she stood behind him and fellow heart-throb Feliciano Lopez in an accreditation queue.

It was then that she coined the nickname ‘Deliciano’ for Lopez – a label that has stuck ever since.

She later wrote on her blog: ‘I joined the accreditation queue behind a bevy of Spaniards.

‘Yes I do mean to use the word bevy as
 it included ‘Deliciano’ Lopez and Fernando Verdasco. Not the worst 
queue I’ve ever been in.’

Fernando Verdasco of Spain caught Judy Murray's eye when she stood behind him in a queue two years ago

When Murray played Lopez in the quarter-finals in 2011, she said: ‘I’m just one of a lot of Feliciano female fans. But of course family loyalty comes into it hugely.’

She added that said she was still recovering from the embarrassment of Murray telling Lopez: ‘My mother thinks you’re beautiful.’

But that did not stop her from describing Lopez as ‘kind of Roman god-like’.

After posing for nude for Cosmopolitan
 in 2008 to raise awareness of male cancer for the Everyman appeal, 
Verdasco said the parts of his body he received most compliments about 
were his arms.

‘It must be all the tennis I play! I’ve never posed naked before but it was really fun,’ he said

Judy said she was still recovering from the embarrassment of Murray telling Feliciano Lopez: 'My mother thinks you’re beautiful'

Whatever Verdasco’s ability to garner the admiration of female fans, the 29-year-old is still expected to be outstripped by Murray when it comes to tennis.

World No 2 Murray is ranked 52 places ahead of the Spaniard, and has won eight of the nine matches they have played.

And while Murray reached the final last year, the quarter-final is as far as Verdasco has managed in ten Wimbledons.

Verdasco said: ‘I have a good 
relationship with Andy. He was practising in Spain when he was younger. 
We always had a good relationship out of the court, and on the court 
also. He’s a great player, one of the best players in the last few years
 on tour.

'You know it is going to be difficult to beat him, also with the crowd and everything. But you need to have faith.’

Verdasco,
 known as ‘Nando’ to his friends, began playing tennis when he was four,
 practising with his father on the two hard courts in the backyard of 
their family home.

This is the second time Murray has faced a pin-up at Wimbledon.

Last year he beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who posed naked for the same cancer campaign as Verdasco, in the semi-final.

Meanwhile, Murray’s biggest obstacle to Wimbledon glory is already planning to end the championships in party mood.

Top seed Novak Djokovic will host royals and Hollywood stars at a fundraiser for his charity foundation at The Roundhouse, North London, on the evening after Sunday’s men’s singles final.

The Duchess of York, Goldie Hawn, Kate Hudson, Naomi Campbell and Boris Becker are among those due to attend the gala dinner for the Novak Djokovic Foundation, which supports children from disadvantaged communities, especially in the world No 1’s native Serbia.
