Today it is a mecca of Asian influence and American tourism - a melting pot of exotic food, lively bars and cheap jewelry and gift shops.

But between 1981 and 19841, New York's Chinatown was undergoing something of a revolution, as the primarily-older, predominantly-male residents that had created the area in lower Manhattan were forced to move aside for the young families and workers that were immigrating to the United States from Mainland China.

This is the period that photographer Robert 'Bud' Glick spent time capturing while working for the New York Chinatown History Project, which is now at the Museum of Chinese in America.

From men and women hard at work to intimate portraits of family life and what is what like back then, Glick's photos are a snapshot of a very specific time in the neighborhood's history, that transformed it into a simmering part of the city.

But for Glick, it was more about taking something old and allowing it to get a new life.

'It's exciting to revisit personal work that I did more than 30 years ago and interpret it digitally, a process that allows me the ability to get more out of a negative than I ever could in the darkroom,' he told The Atlantic magazine. 

'I'm able to give new life to old work. 

'More importantly, time has changed me and the way that I see the work. 

'I've found images, overlooked in the past, that due to the passage of time have taken on new meaning and import.'
