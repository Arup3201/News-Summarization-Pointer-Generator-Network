Blaze: A teenage work experience girl set fire to the wilko store in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, because she was 'a bit bored'

A teenage private schoolgirl who was 'fed up' of her work experience in a shop set fire to it, causing £1million damage, a court heard.

The girl, 15, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was working in a wilko shop, formerly known as Wilkinson's, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, on placement from her fee-paying private school when she started the blaze with a cigarette lighter.

Staff and customers had to be evacuated as thick black smoke filled the shop as the fire, which began in a cage in a warehouse behind the shop, swept the premises. 

Warwick Crown Court heard the 'intelligent student' set fire to waste cardboard in a cage in the goods inward bay as she was fed up of stacking shelves and wanted to go home for the day.

Fire crews were called after the blaze got out of control, and spent more than half an hour battling to quench the fire which began at around 12.20pm on July 8 this year. 

The girl was arrested by police shortly afterwards, and admitted to officers it was a 'stupid thing to do.'

Ninda Gill, prosecuting, said: 'The incident occurred at lunchtime when the store was busy with customers, and elderly customers were caused distress.

'The potential for injury to staff and customers was great as the store was consumed by smoke.'

Miss Gill added that, as a result of the blaze, the hardware chain was now reviewing its national policy in relation to taking on any more work experience students.

She said: 'It has caused a national employer not to engage in work experience schemes.'

CCTV footage played in court showed the teenager leaning into a cage of waste cardboard in the goods inbound bay.

Smoke began to rise one minute later and, as she left the bay, flames began flickering, which quickly turned into an inferno.

Fire investigators rated the danger to life at eight on a scale of one to ten, although the building was evacuated without anyone being injured.

The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, hoped to start a small fire that would get her sent home

Fire crews were called and it took more than half an hour to extinguish the flames at the homeware store

The blaze was tackled by five fire crews using breathing apparatus and a 'conservative estimate' has been put on the damage caused at between £600,000 and £1 million.

John Mohammed, defending, said: 'To a degree she got a bit bored, and she would have liked to have done something more exciting than stocking shelves.

'When she went to the goods inward area she intended to start what she thought would be a small fire in a crate, as she described it, which contained cardboard boxes.

'She lit the corner of a box, and did not expect it to spread any further than the cage it was in.  She thought it would cause some disruption, sufficient for her to be able to go home.'

He added: 'She didn't realise how quickly the fire would spread to other boxes - she certainly did not intend to harm anyone.'

Shoppers and staff had to be evacuated at fire swept through the store at lunchtime, filling it with black smoke

Mr Mohammed said the girl came from a good family, and her parents were 'aghast' at what she did.

He said she bitterly regrets what she did, and she had written a letter of apology to Wilkinson.

The teenager herself said: 'When I was doing it I didn't think of the consequences - it was a stupid act. If I could turn the clock back, I would.'

The girl, who admitted arson with intent to cause damage and being reckless as to whether lives were endangered, was due to be sentenced this week.

But Judge Alan Parker ordered for her to be examined by a psychiatrist first, saying: 'I am very concerned about her, and very concerned about the dissociation referred to.

'The fact that she is an intelligent girl makes it more disturbing.'
