A Connecticut middle school principal has resigned amid questions about his role in making violent movies featuring scantily clad women.

Officials announced Mark Foley's resignation as Granby Memorial Middle School principal on Wednesday.

Superintendent Alan Addley says Foley did nothing illegal. But he says Foley acknowledged that his movies became a 'distraction' and he didn't want continuing media coverage to distract students, parents or staff from academic work.

School officials say Foley and Aaron Vnuk, a seventh-grade guidance counselor in Windsor, ran a movie production company called Moongoyle Entertainment, which had a motto of 'fresh blood, hot babes, cool flicks.'

Foley and Vnuk were placed on administrative leave last month while school officials looked into their movie-making. Vnuk has since returned to his job.

Many defended the educators, saying they should be free to pursue any side interest, so long as those pursuits were not illegal and did not involve students.

However others expressed outrage maintaining that educators should be held to a higher standard, and that any work that objectifies women is incompatible with leading or counseling middle school students.

The school has since released a statement: 'The Granby Board of Education has accepted the resignation of Dr. Mark Foley from his position as Principal of Granby Memorial Middle school,' 

Granby superintendent Dr. Alan Addley said. 'Dr. Foley has served successfully as Middle School Principal since July 2013; however, Dr. Foley acknowledges the distraction caused by the recent publicity concerning his involvement in Moongoyle Entertainment LLC.'  

Double life: The two produced multiple films, as well as running a site featuring women in lingerie and posing in sexually provocative ways

Among the titles produced by the duo were Mind Morgue, The Limb Collector, Demon of Castlebury, and The Bard of Blood. The two also made a full-nudity flick, Slicing Beauty.

That film stars Kerri Taylor who 'bares all as a kinky serial killer who loves to give her victims a satisfying but often morbid peep show.' 

Foley, 45, worked under the pseudonym Mark Daniel, while Vnuk, 39, went by Aaron Thomas Howell.

The two began making films together in 2008, meeting when Foley was vice principal at Windsor's Sage.

They formed a company that became Moongoyle Entertainment, with a website that includes the tagline, 'Fresh Blood. Hot Babes. Cool Pics.'

One shot on the site shows a woman dressed as a provocative schoolgirl.

The pair also released a calendar featuring Moongoyle Web hostess Violett Wolfe posing in lingerie that was 'popular with prison inmates' according to their Facebook page.

The Moongoyle site and YouTube channel have been taken down in the aftermath of the controversy. 

'Put in the context of a school, then it's not appropriate,' Foley said last monthweek.

'But there is no overlap there, that's the thing to keep in mind. This is not being done at school or anything.'

He also made it clear that none of his films ever used one of his, or Vnuk's, current or former students.

In late October, Vnuk accepted a two-week suspension and remains a guidance counselor at Sage Park Middle School. 

He also agreed to refrain from involvement in films that contain nudity and violent horror themes while employed at the school. 

Out of work: Granby Middle School in Granby, Connecticut, where Foley worked

Where it all began: The two first met at Windsor's Sage Park Middle School in Windsor, Connecticut, where Vnuk is still employed as a guidance counselor
