A group of asylum seekers have been flown to Nauru by the Abbott government overnight. Here they are pictured on July 27, 2014 being flown from Cocos Island to Western Australia after they were detained by customs officials

The Abbott government ordered the 157 asylum seekers, including around 50 children, to be sent to Nauru overnight. Immigration minister Scott Morrison (right) says it comes after the Tamil Sri Lankans 'squandered' an opportunity to be returned safely to India.

Scott Morrison MP has confirmed that the asylum seekers were flown to Nauru on Friday night. Three flights departed Western Australian at hourly intervals from 9.30pm. Here the same 1547 asylum seekers are pictured being flown to Australia from Cocos Island.

There are up to fifty children amongst the 157 asylum seekers who were flown to Nauru by the Australian government overnight.

A group of asylum seekers arrived at Cocos Island on July 27 before they reached the Australian mainland. The group of 157 arrived at Cocos Island on July 27 after being detained at sea when their boat was intercepted 27 kilometres from Christmas Island on July 7.

The asylum seekers were fleeing Sri Lanka. They first travelled to India before boarding a boat, seeking refuge. The boat was intercepted by customs officials and the passengers, including around 50 children, were detained at sea for almost a month.
