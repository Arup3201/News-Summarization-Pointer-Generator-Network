Police scanning a river for a missing woman they fear has been murdered were forced to abandon efforts when their dinghy was swept over a raging weir.

Officers from the Northumbria Police Marine Unit were searching for Pamela Jackson, 55, who has not been seen since March 2, when the engine on the vessel cut out as they approached a weir on the River Wear.

The officers tried in vain to cling on to the dinghy, which contained sophisticated search equipment, but were forced to desert the vessel after it became trapped in the cauldron beneath the weir.

Missing: Pamela Jackson, 55, was last seen at her home in Chester-le-Street on March 2

The police officers looked on helplessly as the boat became partially submerged and their expensive computer was soaked.

The drama unfolded on the river at Riverside Park, Chester-le-Street, shortly after 11am yesterday.

Soaked: Officers tried desperately to cling on to the rigid vessel, but it became trapped in the cauldron beneath the weir

PC Chris Dellow, one of the two crew members, said: 'The engine cut out while we were scanning the top of the weir.'

'Our IT department is going to have to look at the laptop computer. Thankfully, no one was hurt,' he added.

The crew had set off earlier from the Chester-le-Street Amateur Rowing Club in their search for Pamela Jackson.                                          

She has not been seen since Saturday, March 2, when she spoke to her son Joe at their home in the Crescent, Chester-le-Street, County Durham.                                                                           

Police have arrested and charged her partner, 50-year-old Adrian Muir with her murder.

Defeat: The crew said the dinghy's engine cut out as they were scanning the top of the weir yesterday
