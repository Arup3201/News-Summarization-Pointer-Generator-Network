This is the moment a group of schoolchildren from Doncaster took on the New Zealand All Blacks with their own rendition of the rugby team's famous Haka.

The world champions were greeted by around 50 pupils at Norton's Junior School, Doncaster, as part of a tour before the Rugby League World Cup which begins on October 26.

The athletes were left stunned by the children's performance of the traditional Kiwi dance, leaving them no choice but to run through the routine themselves afterwards.

Led by one particularly enthusiastic schoolboy, the children chanted their way through the Maori dance to the delight of the All Blacks who were recording the event on their mobile phones.

But, not to be outdone, the professionals sprang into action as soon as the pupils had rounded off their performance.Â 

The Mayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones, 
said: 'It is a major coup to be welcoming the world champions New 
Zealand- and the Cook Islands to Doncaster.'

'The
town has a proud history in rugby league and I am delighted that 
schoolchildren got to perform the Haka. They put on a tremendous 
display, it was really quite fearsome!' he told the Telegraph.

The All Blacks looked thoroughly impressed by the children's performance which they recorded on mobile phones
