The kissing congressman has been dumped.

Voters comprehensively rejected Republican candidate Vance McAllister's bid for re-election to the U.S. House of Represenatives on Tuesday - going against a tide of conservative wins across the country.

The married father of five came to national prominence in April when he was caught on video sharing and kiss and a cuddle with a staff member who was also married - to one of his best and oldest friends.

CCTV footage showed Mr McAllister stealing a kiss from a staffer at his office in Monroe, Louisiana on 23 December 2013. She worked as his district scheduler - and was the wife of a childhood friend

Mr McAllister, a staunch conservative who had campaigned on Christian values, publicly apologised for his indiscretion and asked for forgiveness.

As the mid-term elections approached, Republican leaders called on Mr McAllister to resign.

He initially said he would not stand for re-election but then changed his mind, saying in June 'the people should decide whether or not I continue to represent them.'

The people's decision on that question a resounding 'no' on Tuesday.

Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33, was named as the woman caught in a clinch with Mr McAllister, a Republican Congressman for Louisiana

McAllister failed to win enough votes to reach a run-off ballot between a Republican and Democratic candidate on December 6,The Hill reported. 

Mr McAllister's campaign for re-election included a bizarre ad in which he appeared with his wife, Kelly, and they both studiously avoid mentioning his indiscretion while praising a man who 'owns up to his mistakes.'

Mr McAllister was captured on video in a passionate embrace with a woman later identified as Melissa Anne Hixon Peacock, 33, who worked in his office as a scheduler.

Mrs Peacock's husband, Heath, was a longtime friend of Mr McAllister and the two couples had spent many hours together.

The two man grew up a few miles from each other and graduated from the same high school in 1990. The two men later worked together at an oil and gas company in Houston, Texas. The Peacock's donated $10,000 to Mr McAllister's first campaign.

Mr Peacock was devastated by the revelation of his friend and wife's affair, and said at the time his life was ruined and he and his wife were 'headed for divorce.'

Mr McAllister initially said he would not stand for re-election but changed his mind saying 'voters should decide'. They resoundingly decided against returning him to Congress in Tuesday's mid-term elections

Mr McAllister lost the support of the Republican party over his indiscretion, and then the support of voters in his Louisiana constituency in the mid-term elections on Tuesday

 Mr McAllister's rejection went against the tide of support for Republican candidates at the mid-terms.

The Republicans delivered a humiliating defeat to President Barack Obama's Democrats across the country, securing a majority in the Senate and numerous state governor's positions in the landslide win.
