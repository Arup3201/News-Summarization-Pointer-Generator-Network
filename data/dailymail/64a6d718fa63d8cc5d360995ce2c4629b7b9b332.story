There are no computer-generated special effects and it reduces those watching it to tears.

But The Fault In Our Stars has seen off blockbuster opposition to become the hit movie of the moment.

Based on US author John Green’s novel about two teenagers, who meet at a cancer support group, the film took £3.4million on its opening weekend in the UK, putting it at the top of charts.

Hit: The Fault In Our Stars tells the moving 
love story of terminal cancer patient Hazel, played by Shailene Woodley,

disease.

The film has also sent sales of the book soaring, with Amazon naming the tome as its number one bestseller across all titles (print and Kindle) on its book chart.

It was up against Tom Cruise’s action movie The Edge Of Tomorrow and 22 Jump Street, starring Channing Tatum, which had previously topped the charts.

Cruise’s film took £515,000 at UK box offices at the weekend, and 22 Jump Street £1.5million.

A spokesman for Waterstones said the novel ‘is easily our biggest book of the moment’.
