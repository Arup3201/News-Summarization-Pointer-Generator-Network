Jahi McMath, 13, was left with brain damage the hospital said was so severe that she was effectively dead with no chance of survival without a respirator

The family of a 13-year-old who was declared brain dead 10 months ago following complications from routine tonsil surgery  has petitioned a judge to have her declared 'alive again'.

Chris Dolan, the family's attorney, claimed he has 'medical experts, including world-class experts on brain death who will testify she is not brain dead'.

Jahi McMath's relatives won a high-profile legal battle to keep their daughter's life support machine turned on at the start of the year, after a coroner issued her death certificate.

The hospital treating Jahi released her into the care of her mother Nailah Winkfield and other family members who agreed to  be 'wholly and exclusively responsible'for the teenager.

According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Jahi spent the past several months being looked after at a Roman Catholic hospital in New Jersey at private expense.

But if the judge sides with the family following their petition at Alameda County Superior Court,  it could lead to Jahi being cared for at state taxpayers' expense.

However, Mr Dolan insisted that the latest legal maneuver is not about money. 

Although he did acknowledge that 'she would be eligible for the same state benefits as every other person not brain dead on a ventilator, and who gets full medical care'.

He added that the family wanted Jahi to be looked after in California 'and not have somebody pull the ventilator on her if she is in the hospital'.

The teenager suffered a cardiac arrest following a routine operation to remove her tonsils at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland, California, on December 9.

She was left with brain damage that the hospital said was so severe that she was effectively dead with no chance of survival if a respirator was turned off.

Three doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital applied to turn off her life support machine. On December 12, Jahi was declared brain dead and doctors sought a medical declaration for her death.

But her family, led by mother Nailah and uncle Omari Sealey, has always refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance she could recover.

They said that she responded to her mother's voice and asked that she be removed to a hospital that cared for her.

The family won an injunction preventing the hospital switching off life support and agreed a 'protocol' with them in which the teenager could be transferred to another facility while on a ventilator.

In January, Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer criticized the family's decision to give Jahi 'nutrients' to maintain her brain at optimum efficiency.

'This is a deceased young woman,' he told ABC 7.

'No amount of food, medicine, medical machinery, time or hope is going to bring back her back.

'So it's really wrong and unethical for Mr Dolan  to mislead the family and the public that there's any amount of hope or any food that could possibly bring back this deceased young woman.'

According to CBS San Francisco, UCSF Doctor David Durand said the hospital was aware of the petition, and that the hospital trusts that 'the California courts, the Alameda County Coroner and the State of California will evaluate any claims made by the family's attorneys and decide them in a lawful and just manner'.
