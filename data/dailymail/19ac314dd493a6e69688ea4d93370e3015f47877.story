Ricardo Pisano has been jailed for 18-and-a-half years for manslaughter and preventing the lawful burial of Michael Polding, 62

A rent boy dubbed The Artful Dodger has been jailed for 18-and-a-half years after being convicted of murdering a man whose finances he had bled dry.

Ricardo Pisano killed Michael Polding and wrapped his body up in bedding two months before police discovered it in at the man's home in Brighton last year.

The 36-year-old who had previously escaped from a New Zealand jail claimed he found Mr Polding hanging from a banister in an apparent suicide then fled.

A jury at Lewes Crown Court however convicted Pisano of manslaughter and wounding the 62-year-old after a five-week trial.

The court heard how 'openly gay' Mr Polding died from a 'blunt force trauma' to the chest.

Pisano, who has used several different aliases, previously admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body.

He had evaded police efforts to capture him for a year until being arrested in Southampton on May 7 under a different name.

The criminal told the court he fled the rented two-bedroom flat after finding Mr Polding's body as he feared deportation to South Africa where a 'fatwa' had allegedly been issued against him.

He then told officers a controversial vigilante group had ordered his death because he was deemed 'troublesome' or 'a threat' in the country, and that he would be 'dead in a week' if deported.

Prosecutor Philip Katz QC told the jury: 'The prosecution say that really from the word go (Pisano) lived off Michael Polding financially.

'He had no job and no income, and when Mr Polding decided to sell up in Croydon and move to Brighton, this defendant moved with him.

'The Crown’s case is that this defendant and other friends of his effectively bled Mr Polding dry financially and this defendant, while in this period, pretended to act as his carer and even godson.

'In fact, we say he abused and assaulted Mr Polding, resulting in a serious assault.

'We say that he eventually killed him, and having killed him, left him to rot.'

Mr Polding, who had previously been in a long-term relationship, was drinking heavily and suffered health problems at the time of his death, the court heard.

Speaking after the trial, members of the man's family said they missed him 'every hour of every day'.

Mr Polding's sister, Mary McKeown said: 'As a family we are pleased that the trial is over and that justice has been done for our brother, Michael.

'The time since we were told of Michael’s death has been a rollercoaster for the family, with far more downs than ups. We have managed to get through the weeks and months only by supporting each other.

'Today’s verdict means that we have justice for Michael although that is little comfort against the thought of how we lost him.

'Michael was a happy, loving and gentle person, always ready to help others when needed. He was fun and always enjoyed the company of family and friends.

'When you were with him you knew you would have a great time and would spend the day laughing and enjoying yourself.'

Detective Chief Inspector Jon Fanner, from Surrey and Sussex Major Crime team, said Pisano - who refused to disclose his true identity - had heaped anguish on Mr Polding’s family by leaving him dead for weeks.

Mr Fanner said: 'Michael Polding was a vulnerable man who trusted the defendant to care for and look after him. That trust was breached and the defendant was responsible for Michael’s death.

'After he had died, the defendant abandoned the body of the man he claimed to care for and left Sussex in order to avoid detection and to save himself.

'The fact that Michael’s body lay undisturbed for several weeks before he was found has meant further anguish for the Polding family, on top of their loved one’s death.

'The defendant has refused to reveal his true identity throughout the investigation and trial.

'I would like to pay tribute to Michael’s family for their strength and the assistance they have given to me and my officers during the investigation.

'Nothing is going to bring Michael back or fill the hole in their lives left by his absence but at least today’s verdict means they have justice for Michael.'
