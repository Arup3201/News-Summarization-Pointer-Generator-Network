A group of mothers have staged a mass breastfeed outside Claridge's after staff at the London hotel told a woman to cover up while she was feeding her baby.

The demonstration took place days after Louise Burns complained that she was asked to place a large napkin over her baby's head in the restaurant as she breastfed.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage became embroiled in the row suggesting mothers could 'sit in the corner' in restaurants to avoid offending people - and he insisted it was 'not too difficult' to feed a child in a way that was 'not openly ostentatious'.

At 2pm today, around 40 mothers braved freezing conditions to sit outside the hotel's grand front doors and feed their infants.

The protest was organised by Free to Feed, which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding.

Claridge's has said it 'embraces' breastfeeding, but requests that women are 'discreet towards other guests'. 

But mother-of-three Mrs Burns, 35, said she was 'shocked and appalled' when she was told to cover up. 

Emily Slough, 28, founded Free to Feed in March after she was labelled a 'tramp' on Facebook for breastfeeding in public.

She travelled from Staffordshire with her 18-month-old daughter Matilda to be at the protest.

She said: 'I am here because someone broke the law by telling a woman to be unnecessarily discreet when she was breastfeeding in public. 

'Lou Burns was being discreet when she was feeding her baby. We are here to show Claridge's they are not above the law. But they have said nothing to us, they are pretending we're not here.

'Every time something like this happens, many women are put off for life from breastfeeding.

'We're here to challenge that stigma and show women it's normal and natural.'

In reference to Mr Farage's comments, she said: 'Not everyone agrees. I'm not bothered what people think. We're here to encourage women to breastfeed, regardless.'

Setting out his views on the subject on his regular LBC radio phone-in, Mr Farage said: 'I am not particularly bothered about it, but I know a lot of people do feel very uncomfortable.

'This is just a matter of common sense, isn't it? Given that some people feel very embarrassed by it, it isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that is not openly ostentatious.'

He argued it was 'up to Claridge's' what rules it wanted to operate.

Pressed on whether it would be right for a hotel to ask mothers to use the 'ladies' room' to feed, the MEP replied: 'Or perhaps sit in the corner, or whatever it might be. That is up to Claridge's. 

'It's not an issue I get terribly hung up about but I know particularly people of the older generation feel awkward and embarrassed by it.'

Mumsnet chief executive Justine Roberts said: 'It's bemusing that some people have a problem seeing mums breastfeeding.

'It is of course a natural, essential human process and those with an issue simply need to get over themselves - babies need to be fed when they're hungry and there's nothing ostentatious about a mother responding to that need.'

Downing Street left no doubt that David Cameron disagreed with Mr Farage's comments, saying that it was 'totally unacceptable' for mothers to be made to feel uncomfortable when feeding their babies in public.

A Number 10 spokeswoman said: 'It's for Mr Farage to explain his views.

'The Prime Minister shares the view of the NHS, which is that breastfeeding is completely natural and it's totally unacceptable for any women to be made to feel uncomfortable when breast-feeding in public.'

Posting on Twitter, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'After 'that' interview, Nigel Farage should sit in a corner!'

Mr Farage later issued a statement to clarify his position: 'As I said on the radio, and as I repeat now, I personally have no problem with mothers breastfeeding wherever they want.

'What I said was - and it is immensely frustrating that I have to explain this - that if the establishment in question, in this case Claridge's, wants to maintain rules about this stuff, then that is up to them, as it should be.

'I remarked that perhaps they might ask women to sit in a corner. Did I say I believe they should have to? No. Did I say I personally endorse this concept? No.

Downing Street left no doubt that David Cameron disagreed with Mr Farage's comments, saying that it was 'totally unacceptable' for mothers to be made to feel uncomfortable when breastfeeding

'We do however have to recognise that businesses have a responsibility to all of their customers, some of whom may well be made uncomfortable by public breastfeeding.

'It's a two-way street - breastfeeding women should never be embarrassed by staff asking them to stop and most mums will recognise the need to be discreet in certain, limited, circumstances. It is just a question of good manners.'
