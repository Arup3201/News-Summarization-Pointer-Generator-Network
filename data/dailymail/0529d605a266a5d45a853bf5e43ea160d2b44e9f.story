Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone could be prosecuted after a top banker today admitted taking a £28million 'bribe' from him for selling the racing business to the ‘right bidder’.

German prosecutors are mulling over whether to press charges on Ecclestone who last appeared in the trial of Gerhard Gribkowsky as a witness last year.

Gribkowsky told Munich’s higher regional court today that the charges against him were 'essentially true', breaking eight months of silence.

Claims: Former BayernLB board member Gerhard Gribkowsky, left, admitted accepting a £28million payment from Bernie Ecclestone, right

He described how Ecclestone kept a firm grip on everything to do with Formula 1, adding; ‘You don’t get anywhere if he doesn’t want it.’

While on BayernLB bank's management board from 2003 to 2008, Gribkowsky oversaw the sale of a majority share of the Formula 1 business which had come into the bank’s possession as a result of the bankruptcy of the Kirch media group.

Gribkowsky was accused of accepting the money from Ecclestone to ensure the package was sold to British investor CVC.

Gribkowsky oversaw the sale to CVC in 2006 – allegedly forcing it past the rest of the bank's management and making an unnecessary £42million payment to Ecclestone.

Gribkowsky claimed Ecclestone told him, ‘If you help me to sell Formula 1, I will employ you as a consultant.’

Shortly afterwards he presented CVC as his preferred candidate.

Gribkowsky said Ecclestone had demanded £64million in fees for arranging the sale – a sum the banker said he pushed down to £42million but acknowledged was not necessary at all.

Ecclestone then offered him a position as consultant, asking what he wanted with the phrase, 'Tell me numbers that I know to this day,’ said Gribkowsky.

He said he wanted $50 million US, and although he was expecting to get just a fraction of it - ‘$10 million would be more normal,’ he said – he got nearly the full amount.

Gribkowsky said he gave the money to a children’s cancer charity in Austria, saying he had experienced what families go through when his son became ill. ‘I will save us all the details,’ he told the court.

Bernie Ecclestone told the German court the payment was to stop the banker talking to British tax authorities

The prosecutors saw this movement of money as tax evasion.

His statement to the court came after talks between his lawyers, the prosecutors and the court.

Judge Peter Noll said afterwards that the parties had not reached an agreement – but Gribkowsky spoke in court afterwards anyway, saying the charges were largely correct. 

He is likely to be jailed for between seven years and 10 months and nine years.

His refusal to speak at the trial until now forced the court to hear more than 40 witnesses – including Ecclestone, who described the payment as hush money to stop him from talking to the British tax authorities.

He said Gribkowsky had blackmailed him into paying the money otherwise he would speak to the Inland Revenue about his complicated tax affairs.

Ecclestone said he had done nothing illegal but that a tax probe would tie him down for years and was ‘something I didn't need.’

Ecclestone is still being investigated by the German authorities, it was confirmed. Gribkowsky has been on trial in Munich on three charges since October.

The banker's lawyers have claimed their client is suffering from stress  because of the trial and his conditions in Munich's Stadelheim prison, where Adolf Hitler was once incarcerated.
