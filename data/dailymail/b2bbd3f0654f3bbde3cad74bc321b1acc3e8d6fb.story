A secretive and highly organised group of medieval burglars carried specialist - and rather unusual - equipment to break in to houses, experts have revealed.

The Banu Sasan – a group of rogues, vagabonds, wandering poets and outright criminals – broke and entered using a kit that included a crowbar, a
 candle, stale bread, dried beans, an iron spike, a drill, a stick with
 a cloth on the end of it, a bag of sand – and crucially, a tortoise.

According to research carried out by the
 British historian Professor Clifford Bosworth, Banu Sasan burglars 
often worked by tunnelling into houses, Smithsonian.com reported.

They used an iron spike or an iron hand with claws to break through a house wall. If they thought a door would be a better way of getting in they would use a crowbar instead.

Once they had made a big enough hole to squeeze through, the thief would poke a
 stick with a cloth on the end of it into the hole to prevent being attacked.

The theory was that if someone had noticed a break-in from inside the house, they might attack with  whatever came though the opening with a sword or 
hammer. The stick therefore prevented the thief sustaining an injury.

Once the burglar knew it was safe to enter he employed his partner in crime: the tortoise.

Professor Bosworth described his role, writing: ‘The tortoise is employed thus. The 
burglar has with him a flint-stone and a candle about as big as a little
 finger. He lights the candle and sticks it on the tortoise’s back.

'The 
tortoise is then introduced through the breach into the house, and it 
crawls slowly around, thereby illuminating the house and its contents.’

Once the tortoise had been set up, the burglar employed his bag of sand to check for sleeping inhabitants elsewhere in the house.

He would throw out handfuls of sand at 
intervals, and if no one stirred he entered the house.

Professor Bosworth also said that the burglar might chew noisily on some 
stale bread and beans to impersonate a cat eating a rat or 
mouse so as not alarm any sleeping people in the house.

Despite this knowledge, much about the Banu Sasan remains a 
matter of conjecture.

This is because knowledge of the Islamic 
underworld comes from only a handful of sources. 

Most Arabic literature was produced by authors writing in cities and at courts for their patrons.

It is not at all certain, for example, 
how the Banu Sasan came by their name. The surviving sources mention two
 incompatible explanations.

The first is that Islamic criminals were 
considered to be followers or 'sons' of Sheikh 
Sasan, a Persian prince who was displaced from his rightful place as leader in the
 succession and so took to living a wandering life.

Medieval Persia was home to the Banu Sasan who broke and entered into homes using a kit that included a crowbar, a candle, stale bread, dried beans and crucially, a tortoise. They were widespread for six centuries

The second is that the name is a 
corrupted version of 'Sasanid', the name of the old ruling dynasty of 
Persia that the Arabs destroyed midway through the seventh century. Rule
 by alien conquerors, the theory goes, reduced many Persians to the 
level of outcasts and beggars, and forced them to live by their wits.

There is no way now of knowing which of 
these tales, if either, is true.

It is known however that the Banu Sasan were widespread for six centuries and could be found everywhere from Spain to the Chinese border.

Possessing their own tactics, tricks and slang, they provided a contrast to the glories of Islam’s golden age.

When not breaking into houses they often posed as Muslim mystics or ascetics - well aware that the faithful Muslims could be persuaded to part with money  when a man claimed to be able to perform miracles.

Known as the Banu Sasan, the group of thieves used a highly specialised set of equipment to break into houses and steal people's possessions

The tortoise would have a candle stuck to its shell and would be used to light a room and keep the burglar's hands free while he carried out his theft

Not much is known about the Banu Sasan but they were widespread in medieval times and could be found from Spain to the borders of China
