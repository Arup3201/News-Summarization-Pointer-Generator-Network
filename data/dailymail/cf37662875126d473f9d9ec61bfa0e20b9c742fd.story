Mogul mother: Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, 37, has asked for baby name suggestions via a mass email sent to colleagues, family and friends

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer became a parent for the first time on Sunday, giving birth to a healthy baby boy. However the mogul mother is having trouble coming up with a name for her firstborn.

The 37-year-old, who has already raised eyebrows after sharply limiting her maternity leave to two weeks, has asked for baby name suggestions via a mass email sent to colleagues, family and friends.

Ms Mayer’s husband, San Francisco investor Zachary Bogue, tweeted the couple's news Monday morning, calling their son, 'baby boy Bogue,' before journalist Jeff Jarvis tweeted: 'Just got a large group email from @marissamayer. She’s crowdsourcing suggestions for Baby Boy Bogue’s name! How digital can you get?'

He added: 'Just to be clear, @marissamayer says she'll take suggestions for a name. Nobody suggest Yahoo, now!'

Pamela Redmond Satran, founder of Nameberry, a database and guide on baby names, told MailOnline: 'I
think people are feeling more overwhelmed... and more determined to find the perfect name. 

'As two very busy people who've had a lot on their career plates over the past few months, finding a great name has not been priority one... [they are] just hoping a great name idea will jump out at them.'

Ms
Mayer's unnamed baby started making news before its birth, when the then 
mother-to-be was selected as Yahoo's new CEO in July - and announced her
pregnancy the same day, making her a role model for working moms.

However
she when she announced her intention to take just a few weeks of maternity 
leave, she stirred up a negative discussion about what the potential impact on 
working mothers might be.

As
the face of Yahoo's rebound from 
financial malaise and internal turmoil, Ms Mayer's baby name 
'crowdsourcing' will no doubt get people talking 
about the search engine and its innovative new CEO-mother - even if it is only surrounding the level of complexity that search engines like Yahoo have 
brought to the baby name game.

Yahoo and Google are responsible for many frazzled parents who want names that are unique so 
their child will rise to the top of future search results - but not so outlandish 
that they could be considered strange on the playground.

Ms Satran said: 'There's been a
huge increase in the awareness of the power of names, from celebrities and
their babies with unique, attention-getting names to a consciousness of brand
names and domain names.

Digital announcement: Journalist Jeff Jarvis tweeted: 'Just got a large group email from @marissamayer. She¿s crowdsourcing suggestions for Baby Boy Bogue¿s name! How digital can you get?'

'There
are thousands more names in the general lexicon and names move up and down the
popularity ladder more quickly. 

'Parents can feel overwhelmed by the
amount of information on names they need to digest, the complexity of the
naming process, and the potential effects of choosing the right or wrong name.'

However crowdsourcing baby name ideas like Ms Mayer could be a recipe for paralysis. Opening the floodgates to suggestions from the Internet could easily overwhelm new parents with too many ideas.

'Ultimately,
I do think the decision rests with the parents,' Ms Satran said. 'In the end make your own judgment and keep your own counsel. 
You can sift through everyone's ideas and advice and then take what makes the
most sense to you.'

While
Ms Mayer keeps the public in corporate baby name suspense, as the working woman’s 
celebrity of the moment, some people used the opportunity to criticise 
the CEO’s three-day-old mothering skills.

Do short maternity leaves have negative effects on the children?

Dr. Claire McCarthy, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital, tweeted: 'Poor kid,' referring to the notion of crowd-sourcing a baby’s name.

Ina
Steinbach, owner of a communications agency in Germany tweeted that 
taking baby name suggestions via the Internet 'can’t be a good idea, 
ever.'

Mary Shank Rockman, a press agent, sympathized with Ms Mayer, writing: 'I had the same problem! Difficult choice & pressure!'

While others have slated her work-life balance, saying it sets an unattainable precedent.

Creating discussions : As the head of a public company, and now the face of working mothers everywhere, Ms Mayers will continue to be scrutinized closely

One
Twitter user wrote: 'I can’t see how Marissa Mayer is anything but a 
terrible role model for women,' while another commented, 'It's a bad precedent to set, because 
not everyone will have the opportunity to send emails and dial into 
meetings and still consider it work.'

More controversy: Adding fuel to the fire, Fortune magazine has featured the new mother on its current cover mysteriously not pregnant

Allison Benedikt at Slate made the case that Ms Mayer is making a 'huge mistake' in cutting her maternity leave short.

She
wrote yesterday: 'She should do whatever she wants to do, but she 
should want to do something different than what she wants to do. ... 
It’s nuts to ignore that there is a BABY involved here.'

Amy Coulterman, a communications manager for non-government organizations in Canada, tweeted: 'Stop pretending we can have it all!'

Adding fuel to the fire, Fortune magazine, which tweeted this morning 'Marissa Mayer's brief maternity leave: Progress or workaholism?' has featured the new mother on its current cover, out on newsstands Saturday October 6, mysteriously not pregnant.

Parenting websites have come out saying it is a 'big diss' to motherhood, with CafeMom asking today whether Fortune magazine thought 'her svelte figure would portray power in a way that her baby bump would not?'

As the head of a public company, and now the face of working mothers everywhere, Ms Mayer will continue to be scrutinized closely. She is only three-days in, and already the question on many Twitter users' mind is, 'how will she manage trying to have it all?'
