An 88-year-old woman was attacked by a rabid raccoon Sunday night when she went to let her cat into the house.

The Hamden, Conn., woman, identified only by her first name, Betty, said the animal followed her cat into her Brinsmade Road house before she could shut the door on it.

'The thing about it that was so frightening was it's awful strength,' she told reporters. 'When it jumped on me it was on me and I'm pulling on it and everything else, the thing was terribly alive and terribly strong.'

Betty, who asked her face not be shown as she's healing, was attacked by a rabid raccoon Sunday when she let her cat into the house

Betty, 88, said the animal ran into her home following her house cat, who has since disappeared

Fox CT reports Animal Control found the raccoon had rabies after testing it at the Connecticut Public Health Lab.

The disease, which attacks the central nervous system, can be fatal without proper treatment.

Early symptoms include fever, fatigue, and headaches before the most well known foaming at the mouth, which does not appear until rabies has progressed to its advanced stages.

The animal bit Betty on her elbow, hand, forearm, and face while she struggled to subdue it.

'She is 88 and she is stronger than I thought she was,' son Rory McKernan told Fox CT.

Police euthanized the animal at the scene.

McKernan said the house was left a disaster as his mother struggled to keep the raccoon at bay.

'My brother kept saying it looks like a crime scene on TV, there were
 splatters, hand prints, puddles and things like that,' he said.

They've since scrubbed through the living room with bleach and thrown the couch cushions in the trash.

Police euthanized the animal on scene and it later tested positive for rabies

Betty's cat remains missing, having fled during the attack.

Before being informed of the rabies, Betty told news crews that once she healed she expected life to go on as normal.

'Oh I’ll be alright it just takes time for various things to heal and then I’ll go back out and walk the garden path again.' she said.
