Swansea are weighing up a move for Celtic’s former Cardiff City defender Adam Matthews.

Manager Garry Monk had been pursuing Kyle Naughton from Tottenham but the asking price is proving prohibitive.

Matthews has two years left on his contract at Celtic and the Wales international could be available for around £3 million.

Celtic are looking at offloading some of their players owing to the financial implications of their impending Champions League exit following their 4-1 first-leg qualifying defeat to Legia Warsaw.

Meanwhile, Inter Milan hope to conclude their protracted move for Gary Medel from Cardiff by Wednesday. 

Cardiff want £10m for the Chile international and the Italians are revising the payment structure of their bid to put more cash up front.
