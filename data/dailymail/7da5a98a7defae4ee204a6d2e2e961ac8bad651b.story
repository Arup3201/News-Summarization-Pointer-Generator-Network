The Georgia widow accused of lying to investigators about the death of her husband, who was shot dead by her alleged lover in 2010, was found guilty on nine of 13 felony counts this afternoon.

Prosecutors accused Atlanta resident Andrea Sneiderman of making false statements to police investigating her husband's slaying and lying under oath during the trial of her former boss and paramour, Hemy Neuman.

The 13-count indictment included charges of making false statements, hindering an investigation and perjury.

Guilty: Andrea Sneiderman, pictured in court Monday, was found guilty on 
nine of 13 felony counts of lying to police and hindering the 
investigation into the murder of her husband

Confined: Andrea Sneiderman leaves the courtroom in custody to await sentencing Tuesday morning

Spared: Sneiderman had been facing murder charges, but those were dropped last month by the prosecution

Sneiderman, 37, was found guilty of four counts of perjury, hindering the apprehension of a criminal, concealment of material facts, and three counts of giving false statements. She was found not guilty of three counts of perjury and one count of giving a false statement.

Jurors got the case Thursday and deliberated all Friday before leaving without a verdict. They returned for additional deliberations Monday and delivered the verdict after more than three hours.

Sneiderman's defense has said prosecutors had a weak case but were desperate to convict Sneiderman of something.

Sneiderman's lover Hemy Neuman was 
last year convicted of the murder of Rusty Sneiderman and sentenced to 
life in prison. He told police an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it.

The mother-of-two was initially accused of arranging her husband's murder but the charges were dropped last month.

DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James cited his recent review of evidence the defense turned over as part of pre-trial discovery.

Thomas Clegg, one of Sneiderman's lead attorneys, balked at the explanation. 'I believe they have known all along that they didn't have a murder case,' he said in open court.

The judge granted James' request to drop the more serious charges before the start of jury selection and released Sneiderman from house arrest.

Judge Gregory Adams set Sneiderman's sentencing for 9am Tuesday and said she had 30 days to file her notice of intent to appeal.

MyFox Atlanta reported
that jurors in the trial resumed their deliberations Monday morning 
after taking a break over the weekend. At around 1.15am, it was 
announced that a verdict had been reached.

About
15 minutes later, the verdict was read aloud. Miss Sneiderman showed 
little emotion as she sat with her defense team, carefully writing down 
the counts and the jury's findings. She was then led out of the 
courtroom by deputies.

Throughout
the trial, prosecutors played and replayed video and audio clips of 
Sneiderman's interviews with police investigators and her testimony 
during Neuman's trial. They contrasted that with witness testimony and documents that they said proved she had lied to police and the court.The
defense called a string of character witnesses who testified that 
Andrea and Rusty Sneiderman had a happy and loving relationship. They 
also called experts to refute some of the documents and evidence 
presented by the prosecution.

During testimony earlier this month, Rusty's father Don 
Sneiderman said his daughter-in-law called him and told him what 
happened while she was on the way to the hospital.

'There are some calls you never forget,' he said.

But Sneiderman herself testified at her lover's murder trial that she 'didn’t
know what happened to Rusty until I got to the emergency room. No one 
told me what happened to Rusty', Fox Atlanta reported.

Sneiderman's defense 
attorneys painted her out as a happily married mother devastated by her 
husband's death, not the woman prosecutors described as engaged in a 
'forbidden romance' with her boss.

The contrasting portraits of 
Sneiderman emerged during opening statements in her trial on charges of 
lying under oath and hindering the investigation into her husband's 
death.

DeKalb County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury: 'The evidence will show a forbidden 
romance that ends in murder, silence despite her suspicion, and lies to 
conceal the truth from her family, from her friends, from the police and
from a jury.'

Sneiderman's husband, 36-year-old 
Rusty Sneiderman, was fatally shot in November 2010 outside a suburban 
Atlanta preschool while he was dropping his son off.

Neuman was convicted of the killing in March 2012, but he was found to be mentally ill.

He told mental health examiners 
he was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an 
angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John.

The angel ordered him to 
fatally shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview.

The 37-year-old Sneiderman was arrested last August in connection to her husband's killing. She has pleaded not guilty and has repeatedly denied any romantic relationship with Neuman.

DeKalb
County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury that evidence in the case 
will show that soon after Sneiderman took a job at General Electric, she
formed a friendship with Neuman that quickly blossomed into a romantic 
relationship.

But because she was married with young children, she felt conflicted about it and was hot and cold with Neuman, Hill said.

Emails the state plans to present show 'she feels torn between her reality and her desires,' Hill said.

Andrea
Sneiderman had willingly participated in a relationship with Neuman, 
sharing deep personal secrets with him, sending him photos of her 
children, and sharing kisses and other physical contact with him during 
business trips, Hill said.

But
she failed to tell police about her relationship with Neuman and failed
to tell them she suspected he might be involved, Hill said.

'If the police had known about the relationship, they would have known why someone wanted Rusty dead,' she said.

Sneiderman also lied under oath 
during Neuman's trial last year, denying the romantic relationship and 
lying about when she found out her husband had been shot, Hill said.

As
she was driving to the preschool after getting a call from an employee 
there about an emergency, she called her father-in-law and told him his 
son had been shot, even though no one had told her that yet, Hill said.

Defense
attorney Tom Clegg told jurors that Sneiderman told police the day 
after her husband's killing that Neuman had tried to break up her 
family.

She was happily
married, brushed aside advances from Neuman at work and never 
complained to human resources because she didn't want to create problems
for herself and couldn't imagine he would do harm, Clegg said.

'The
bottom line is Hemy Neuman was a pest, Hemy Neuman was a nuisance. Hemy
Neuman, to this woman, was not a threat,' Clegg said.

Sneiderman cooperated with police and suggested Neuman might have been involved, Clegg said.

She
was so broken up over her husband's death that, on what would have been
their 10th wedding anniversary, she put on her wedding dress and went 
to the synagogue in Florida where they got married, hoping to feel his 
spirit, Clegg said.
