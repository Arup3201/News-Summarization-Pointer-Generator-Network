Rio Ferdinand had the opportunity to join Barcelona or Real Madrid whilst at Manchester United, before eventually agreeing a one year deal with Queens Park Rangers this summer.

The 35-year-old told The Express that, whilst he was winning trophies in Manchester, he had no desire to leave Old Trafford.

Ferdinand said: 'There was interest from other clubs [but] I was winning things. So my head was never turned to go anywhere else.'

Huge success: Ferdinand played an integral part in Manchester United's domestic success 

The central defender gained several honours with the club, including six Premier League winners’ medals and a Champions League triumph in Moscow in 2008.

The former England vice-captain also told the paper that AS Roma came calling, but turning down moves away from Manchester proved an easy task. 

The Italian side have managed to lure ex-Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole this summer while Ferdinand has instead chosen to join Rangers to experience a different challenge as he approaches the end of his career. 

He will, of course, be playing his football under Harry Redknapp, the man who gave him his senior debut for West Ham United in 1996.

Speaking at his unveiling, the defender lavished praise on Redknapp and admitted his offer of a contract at Loftus Road changed his mind about an immediate retirement from football: 'When Harry gave me the call, all bets were off.'

Ferdinand worked for the BBC as a pundit at this summer’s World Cup and the likelihood is that he will return to television once his playing career is finally over, as well as continuing with his extensive charity work.
