Belgium legend Marc Degryse has publicly criticised Eden Hazard and thinks the midfielder needs a 'kick up the a***'.

The Chelsea playmaker came under fire from boss Jose Mourinho towards the end of last season over his defensive work ethic, and it seems Degryse is of the same opinion.

The former Belgium striker, 48, says Hazard needs to grow up with the World Cup fast approaching.

Degryse said: ‘He has to work harder defensively.

‘Against Sweden he switched off several times, just like he did in the Champions League for Chelsea against Atletico Madrid.

‘If that doesn’t change (Marc) Wilmots will have to resolve it by dropping him.

‘Hazard is the type of player that sometimes needs a kick up the a***!’

Belgium have been drawn in Group H alongside Algeria, Russia and South Korea.

Their two pre-World Cup friendlies ended in wins, 5-1 against Luxembourg and 2-0 against Sweden with Hazard netting once.
