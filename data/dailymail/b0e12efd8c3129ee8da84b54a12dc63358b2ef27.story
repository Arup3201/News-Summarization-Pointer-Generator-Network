Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says his Chelsea side are still improving and that their young stars will be better than Manchester City in five years time.

Mourinho admitted that at the moment City's squad may be stronger, despite the five-point lead Chelsea have in the Premier League.

But he insisted that while his players were still developing, City players will not be better next season than they are this year. 

Mourinho says the likes of Eden Hazard will be at their peak in five years time, while City's stars will not

Brazilian pair Oscar and Willian are another two players that Mourniho believes are still improving

Defenders Cesar Azpilicueta and Kurt Zouma are already part of the first team squad but can still get better

'From Mancini's time, three years with the same team, players in the best moment of their careers, they don't have the young players in the development phase,' Mourinho told Gary Neville in the Telegraph.

'They don't have players who next season can be better than this season.'

'They don't have yet – Frank [Lampard] is the only one of that age – the players who next year are going to be one, heavy year older. They are all on the 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 level.

Mourinho highlighted ex-Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard as one of City's ageing stars

Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is in his prime now, but will be 31 in five years time

The likes of Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure have been crucial for City, but are 28 and 31 years old

'You tell me. If we keep this team, and they keep that team: in five years time, who is going to be better?

'I say immediately – us, because in five years I'm going to have [Eden] Hazard, Oscar, Willian, [Cesar] Azpilicueta, [Kurt] Zouma, in the best moment of their careers, and the fantastic players I have now, at 28, 29. A fantastic team with lots of solutions.'
