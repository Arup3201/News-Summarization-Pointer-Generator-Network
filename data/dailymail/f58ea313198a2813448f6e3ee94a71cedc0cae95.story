Well at least they'd be easy to spot in a line-up.

These hilarious computer-generated 'e-fit' images reveal some of the more unusual-looking suspects wanted by police last year-  including a ginger thief whose bright orange hair makes him look like Harry Potter character Ron Weasley.

In one appeal by Gloucestershire Police, they released an image of woman in a bid to track down the thief wanted for a £1,000 distraction burglary from a 73-year-old victim in April in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
