Suppliers to one of America's biggest poultry chains have been accused of animal cruelty after its workers were apparently filmed kicking, throwing and burning chickens alive.

Animal rights group Mercy for Animals has released undercover footage which it claims was recorded at a Tennessee slaughterhouse run by Chick-fil-A supplier Koch Foods.

The video, introduced by The Simpsons co-creator and animal rights campaigner Sam Simon, also claims to show footage from a worker at a poultry farm contracted with Koch Foods.

In the clips, staff are seen throwing chickens violently by their legs and necks into cages, often, the video alleges, breaking their bones in the process.

'Cruel': Undercover footage allegedly shows workers at a poultry farm contracted with a supplier to restaurant chain Chick-fil-A violently throwing chickens into cages, often breaking their legs and wings in the process

Allegations: Some of the birds also have their heads crushed in the cage doors as they are transported to the slaughterhouse, according to the video taken by animal rights group Mercy for Animals

The animal rights group claims the birds are bred to grow so quickly they suffer 'crippling deformities'

Some of the birds also have their heads crushed in the cage doors as they are transported to the slaughterhouse.

The video then shows the chickens being slung upside down on metal shackles on a conveyor belt which drags them through an 'electrified vat of water' to stun them.

This, it claims, often only partially paralyses them, leaving them still conscious when they are pulled across a blade to cut their throats.

Some of the birds, however, are still breathing when they are dragged through scolding water to remove their feathers, burning them alive, the video claims.

Mr Simon signs off the video with the claim: 'Disgusting cruelty is standard practice at Chick-fil-A suppliers nationwide. But it doesn't have to be this way.

'Tell Chick-fil-A to end it's disgusting treatment of chickens by adopting stronger animal welfare standard to prevent the cruelty you have just witnessed.'

Koch Foods branded the video 'inaccurate and out of context' in a statement yesterday, it was reported by The Tennessean.

Koch Foods CEO Joe Grendys said: 'The chicken processing business is a highly regulated industry with well-established industry processing procedures, and our company works hard every day to ensure our employees and contractors follow strict regulations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.' 

Chick-fil-A also responded by asserting its commitment to humane practices.

It said: 'As a values-based organization, we strictly partner with suppliers who share in our goal of responsible environmental stewardship, and maintain our values throughout all animal welfare and management practices.'

Koch Foods and Chick-fil-A said they stopped working together last year.

But Mercy for Animals director of investigations, Matt Rice, claims to have recorded phone calls that show the companies were still working together earlier this year when the video was taken. 

Rice said the acts recorded in the factory and farm did not violate any federal or Tennessee laws, but the group hopes their investigation will encourage firms to adopt more humane practices.
