Betting on high-stakes machines does cause harm by impairing players' ability to make decisions, according to a report yesterday.

Academics tested a roulette-style game similar to controversial Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs) - and found that playing at higher stakes may fuel gambling problems.

Gamers who staked £20 were more likely to make poor decisions afterwards, such as continuing to gamble regardless of the consequences, than those gambling £2.

The research is published in a long-awaited report funded by the major bookmakers, who promised to reveal the ‘whole truth’ about whether the betting machines are harmful.

But the study does not recommend cutting the stake on what have been dubbed ‘crack cocaine’ machines.

Instead, the authors conclude that more research is needed in ‘real gambling environments’ to understand the full effects.

Campaigners branded the report, which has been handed to ministers, a whitewash as researchers were not asked to study actual FOBT machines on which players can lose £100 per spin.

The study is one of several published by the Responsible Gambling Trust (RGT), an industry-funded charity.

Its chair Neil Goulden, the former boss of Gala Coral, said in March last year: ‘Betting machines have long been blamed for problem gambling but that has never been backed up by evidence.

‘I have the backing of the Gambling Commission and the Government. I want this study to deliver the whole truth.’

In one of the studies, which looks at the impact of how much people stake, University of Lincoln researchers asked 32 regular gamers to play virtual roulette with no money, £2 or £20.

Afterwards the participants did questionnaires designed to test their decision-making ability. Those who had staked more, whether they won or lost, made more ‘impulsive and poor quality decisions’.

The researchers said: ‘It was demonstrated that gambling on a virtual roulette simulation at higher stakes impairs decision-making quality, which in turn may reduce self-control when gambling.’

Problem gambling, they explain, is ‘characterised by a lack of control and impaired decision-making performance, with a disregard for future negative consequences of gambling.’

They said the effects they saw may also be ‘muted’ by the fact players were not spending their own money, but were given it for the experiment, and could not choose the stake themselves.

But they concluded that the study, which they said was carried out in a laboratory to control all the other variables, needed to be undertaken in a betting shop to understand the effects.

Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, which calls for the stake on FOBTs to be slashed, said: ‘Whilst this research did not focus solely on FOBTs and why they are addictive, the one strand that is relevant to this debate clearly shows that the £100 stake is harmful.

‘If this type of research is necessary why was it not included in the initial study? It is looking increasingly likely that the Responsible Gambling Trust is once again being used to try to kick this issue into the long grass.’

Unimpressed: Sir Robin Wales (above), the mayor of the London borough of Newham - which is also calling for curbs on the machines - said it was clear that the report 'only has the interests of the industry at its heart'

‘We were promised "the whole truth" about fixed odd betting terminals. 

'Instead we have a half-hearted and woefully inadequate attempt which makes absolutely no concrete recommendations… to help problem gamblers, the communities they belong to or the nation’s high streets.’

The RGT insist their report is ‘world leading and independently conducted’ and gives them a wealth of evidence which could help identify problem gamblers.

They point to one of the other studies, by NatCen social research, which looked at data on the behaviour of 4,000 gamers. 

The researchers were able identify problem gamblers using factors such as speed and duration of play, not just the stake.

Mr Goulden said yesterday: ‘The researchers have shown that it is possible to distinguish between problem and non-problem gaming machine play, and they have provided many important insights about player behaviour.

‘This research has huge potential to inform the industry’s approach to minimising gambling-related harm and we strongly urge the industry to make every effort to improve how problem behaviour is more effectively monitored and managed in the future.’

There are 33,000 FOBT machines across the country and they account for half of bookmakers profits. Customers and betting shop managers have blamed them for fuelling gambling addiction.

Clive Efford, Labour’s shadow sports minister, said: ‘It is disappointing that this research cannot tell us how levels of stakes and prizes impact on problem gamblers. This was promised by the Prime Minister and it is hugely embarrassing for him that it does not provide the information.’
