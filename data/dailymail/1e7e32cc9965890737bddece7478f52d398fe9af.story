A private school in Nashville has reportedly turned away a pair of potential students because their parents are gay. 

The Davidson Academy had allegedly told Brian Copeland they'd host him on a tour of the school he was considering for his children but the visit was cancelled when it was discovered he was raising them with his same-sex partner.

Copeland has a son entering pre-kindergarten and an 8 month old daughter he wanted to send to the nondenominational school. 

The Davidson Academy told Brian Copeland and Greg Bullard they couldn't teach their children because they were a same-sex couple

This rejection letter from the school cited their admissions policy regarding 'unacceptable lifestyle conduct'

The school has no affiliation with any specific church but says it operates in the Christian tradition.  

The Tennessean reports that a Jan. 14 letter told Copeland 'another education provider would be a better fit for your children. Therefore, we cannot grant admission to your children.'

They had not yet officially applied for admission. 

Copeland, a real estate agent, is married to Greg Bullard.

Bullard is the pastor of Covenant of the Cross.

The pair wed in California in 2013 and have raised the children from birth. 

Bullard put the letter on his Facebook page, being shared more than 100 times.

'I am so disappointed in my high school, Davidson Academy,' wrote Toby Compton, executive director of the Metro Sports Authority. 'Sad, truly sad. Hurt deeply and I can't sleep.'  

The couple, who have raised the children from birth, wed in 2013

Bullard said he posted the rejection to 'let my friends know that discrimination affects people you know and love and still hurts no matter how many times you go through it.

We chose this school because of its rigorous faith-based K-12 academics and extracurricular activities; and, a friend with a son there asked them if a family like ours would be allowed and was told yes. After a phone conversation, fully disclosing we are a two-dad family, an appointment was set for us. I receive this letter canceling our appointment without even getting a chance.'

He later said he didn't want to 'harm the school' only show that 'discrimination and inequality is alive and well.'

'I want to make that very clear,' he added. 'We want our children to have a Christian education, and we're finding that very, very hard.'

Davidson's administrators have yet to respond to media requests. 

The pair desperately want their children raised in a Christian school but are finding it difficult

However The Christian Examiner notes that the letter cited the school's handbook and admissions policy.

It states: 'Davidson Academy has the right and responsibility to do everything possible to ensure that its expressed purposes, mission, and beliefs continue in their highest traditions and are not harmed, compromised, or hindered by unacceptable lifestyle conduct on the part of its students, parents or guardians ...'

The couple say they have no plans to seek legal action against the school.

A rep from the Tennessee Equality Project said that if there had been any other incidents of a Nashville school rejecting a student based on their parent's orientation, they hadn't heard of it.

But simply seeing the numbers of people sharing the letter online show how mcuh the 'conversation has significantly changed in Nashville.'

'Discriminating against parents, in this case, has an effect on the child,' said the group's executive director Chris Sanders. 'And I think maybe that's what is so striking to so many straight allies. Do you hit an entire family if you have a disagreement with the parents? That's why this has legs. That's why this has power. That's why this has emotional impact.'
