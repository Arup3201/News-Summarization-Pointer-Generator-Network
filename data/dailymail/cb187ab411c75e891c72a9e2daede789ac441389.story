A huge bonus bonanza of up to £10 million is at stake as part of England’s kit deal with Nike — although Roy Hodgson’s side will need to win the World Cup for the Football Association to cash in fully.

England have the second most lucrative football kit deal in the world, worth £25m per year until 2018. Only France’s deal, also until 2018 with Nike is worth more, at £36m per year.

But a series of performance and sales-related bonuses could make 2014 a bumper year for the FA if Steven Gerrard and Co can achieve glory in Brazil.

Get shirty! England's kit deal with Nike is worth an incredible £25million a year

Unlikely, but... England wil pick up a £10million bonus from their sponsors if they win the World Cup

In a typical non-tournament year, Nike expect global sales of a million official England replica shirts, rising to double that in tournament years and with a potential sales total of more than three million this year, if England go deep into the tournament.

The status of English football in many parts of the world means sales are made in many countries where England are many fans’ ‘second’ nation in terms of support.

The further England go, the more shirts are sold and the more the FA will make from revenue sharing.

Precise details of bonus schedules and revenue splits are closely guarded secrets but the Mail on Sunday has seen private industry estimates that show the total value of the kit sponsorship deals for the 32 World Cup teams, and expected sales and revenue forecasts, depending on progress.

All told, 10 million replica shirts will be sold this year for those nations, with England leading the way. The 32 kit deals are worth a combined £223m a year — or an average of £7m each. Germany, Brazil, Spain, Italy, Russia, Netherlands, USA and Argentina are worth most behind France and England
