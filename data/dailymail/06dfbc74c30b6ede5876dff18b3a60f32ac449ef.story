The Turkish military has deployed tanks to the Syrian border where thousands of refugees - many of them ethnic Kurds - have gathered, fleeing from murderous Islamic State militants.

The porous border is believed to be the main route for Western would-be jihadists to join up with IS and other extremist groups in the Middle East as recruits fly into airports popular with tourists in southern Turkey, before easily slipping over the border into war-torn Syria.

But armed forces have rushed to control the barbed wire territory line which is now a key route of escape for Syrian Kurds.

Meanwhile, Kurdish forces in northern Syria pushed back an advance by Islamic State fighters towards a strategic town on the Turkish border on Thursday and appealed for U.S.-led air strikes to target the insurgents' tanks and heavy armaments.

Influx: An estimated 1,300 people crossed into Turkey on Wednesday alone, and the total number since the fighting began near Kobani had risen to 144,000

Desperate: At least 140,000 Kurds have fled Kobani and its surrounding villages since Friday, crossing into Turkey

Islamic State launched a new offensive to try to capture the border town of Kobani more than a week ago, besieging it from three sides. 

The move appears to have sparked a state of panic within the Kurdish community. 

At least 140,000 Kurds have fled the town and surrounding villages since Friday crossing into Turkey, according to figures compiled by the United Nations.

Turkish soldiers have been deployed to stem the relentless flow into their country - and also block Kurdish men from crossing in the opposite direction to fight against Islamic State militants.

The U.N. refugee agency said the first of eight planned aid flights landed in the southern Turkish city of Adana, carrying pre-fabricated warehouses, sleeping mats, plastic sheeting and cooking utensils to help Turkey cope with the influx.

Kurdish and Islamic State fighters exchanged artillery and machine gun fire in a cluster of villages about nine miles west of Kobani, where the frontline appeared not to have moved significantly for several days, a Reuters witness said.

Kurdish officials meanwhile said Islamic State had concentrated their fighters south of the town late on Wednesday and had pushed towards it, but that the main Kurdish armed group in northern Syria, the YPG, had repelled them overnight.

'The YPG responded and pushed them back to about 10-15 km (six-nine miles) away,' Idris Nassan, deputy minister for foreign affairs in the Kobani canton, told news agency Reuters by telephone.

Syrian Kurdish refugees watching the fighting from a hill on the Turkish side of the border said the Islamic State insurgents had not been able to advance from positions they had taken up in olive groves west of Kobani.

Turkish military vehicles patrolled their side of the border, with soldiers occasionally moving people away from the hill overlooking the fighting. Heavy weapons fire could also be heard further away from the border inside Syrian territory.

The town's location has been blocking the Sunni Muslim insurgents from consolidating their gains in northern Syria. The group tried to take the town in July but was repulsed by local forces backed by Kurdish fighters from Turkey.

The YPG on Thursday renewed calls for U.S.-led air strikes to hit Islamic State positions around Kobani.

'Although all ISIS positions and their heavy armaments, including tanks and armoured vehicles around Kobani, are clear and within view for everyone on the front line, it is worth noting that these targets have not been bombed yet,' YPG spokesman Redur Xelil said.

'We are of the utmost readiness to cooperate with the international coalition forces against terrorism and give it detailed information about the main targets,' he said.

A thin but steady stream of people continued to cross from Syria into Turkey at the Yumurtalik border crossing after it reopened on Thursday, with police carrying out security checks. An estimated 1,300 people crossed into Turkey on Wednesday alone, and the total number since the fighting began near Kobani had risen to 144,000, according to the United Nations.

Turkey is already sheltering more than 1.3 million refugees from Syria. The U.N. refugee agency was helping the Turkish authorities set up two new camps to cope with the influx, UNHCR spokeswoman Selin Unal said.

Turkey has been slow to join calls for a coalition to fight Islamic State in Syria, worried in part about links between Syrian Kurds and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a militant group which waged a three-decade campaign against the Turkish state for greater Kurdish rights.

The PKK has called on Turkey's Kurds to join the fight to defend Kobani and accused Ankara of supporting Islamic State. Residents in the border area say hundreds of youths have done so, although Turkish security forces have been trying to keep them from crossing the frontier.

Life changing: Limited to what they can carry, families have had to leave all their possessions behind and simply take bags of essential items

Turkey strongly denies it has given any form of support to the Islamist militants but Western countries say its open borders during Syria's three-year civil war allowed Islamic State and other radical groups to grow in power.

Ocalan Iso, a Kurdish defence official, confirmed that YPG forces had stemmed Islamic State's advances south of Kobani, known as Ayn al-Arab in Arabic.

'As our fighters secured the area, we found 12 Islamic State bodies,' he said by telephone. Islamic State fighters also remain to the east and west of the town and fighting continues in the south.

Both men said they had also heard warplanes flying over Kobani late on Wednesday for the first time, but it was not clear exactly which areas they were targeting.

A third night of U.S.-led air strikes on Wednesday targeted Islamic State-controlled oil refineries in eastern Syria, U.S. officials said.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war, said eight YPG fighters had been killed in overnight clashes.
