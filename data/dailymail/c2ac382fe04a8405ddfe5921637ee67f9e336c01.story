A teenager broke down in tears after a dance instructor asked her to perform 'erotically' on stage to the controversial song Blurred Lines, her parents have claimed.

Bella Hobbs, 14, was allegedly asked to push her cleavage out, pull her skirt up to her crotch and gyrate her hips during the lesson at The Castle School in Thornbury, near Bristol.

When Bella refused, the Year 10 pupil was forced to argue with her Zumba instructor - who was an external teacher from outside the school - in front of friends, her parents say.

Bella Hobbs, 14, a pupil at the Castle School in Thornbury, near Bristol (pictured above), was allegedly reduced to tears after her Zumba dance instructor asked her to perfom erotically to the controversial song Blurred Lines

She also had to apparently say 'no' four times before the instructor allowed her to sit out of the dance.

Now Bella’s 'horrified' parents, Catherine Hobbs and 
Neil Castleton, from Thornbury, are demanding an apology from the school.

They say the song - which has been criticised for glorifying rape and sexual violence - should never have been played in front of the children.

The chart-topping single, written by Robin Thicke, was even banned by some student unions over its controversial lyrics after it was released last summer.

Ms Hobbs, 44, a former teacher who now works as a therapist, said: 'I am not a prude, I am a liberal person
 and I haven’t got a problem with sexuality, but for a child to feel 
worried that what they are doing is dirty and rude, that is wrong.'

Ms Hobbs claims her daughter came home from school in a state of distress. Bella told her parents she felt 'dirty' about being asked to perform the moves because they were 'too sexy'.

She said: 'Bella said that she was unhappy about the way that she was asked to dance, she said it was dirty.

'When she showed me the dance that she was expected to do, I would have been horrified.

'She said she was told to dance by pushing her cleavage out and wiggling her chest, pulling her skirt up to her crotch and gyrating her hips.'

Ms Hobbs also said it must have been hard for her daughter to stand her ground so many times.

Melanie Warnes, executive headmaster at the school, pictured above, said Bella's mother and father were the only parents to complain. She said the two PE teachers overseeing the lesson did not notice the song being played

She claims the two teachers observing the Zumba class subliminally endorsed the sexualisation of children by not stopping the dance.

Ms Hobbs said she is now concerned about the impact the alleged incident will have on the other children.

She said Bella did not understand the song and she had to spend two hours explaining to her daughter why the graphic lyrics were wrong.

But Melanie Warnes, the school’s executive headmaster, said Bella’s mother and father were the only parents to make a complaint about the Zumba classes.

She said the lyrics would not have been audible underneath the shouted instructions and the general sound of 50 students and children making noise.

The two experienced female PE teachers, who were overseeing the lesson, did not notice the song being played, she said.

She said: 'We are investigating and we would take it very seriously if any age inappropriate lyrics have been used.

'The teachers were not aware that any inappropriate dance moves had been made.'

She added that Bella, as an experienced dancer, had been asked to demonstrate but refused and there was 'no issue made'.

She said the song was most likely part of an iPod playlist of lively dance music and the teachers were 'not aware of anybody being uncomfortable'.
