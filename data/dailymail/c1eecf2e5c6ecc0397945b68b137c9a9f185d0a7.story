2012 was the second wettest year in British history, the Met Office has revealed today.

Official figures show that 1,330mm (52.4 inches) of rain fell in the past 12 months - just 7mm short of the highest total reached in 2000.

Depressingly this new data also shows that four of the five wettest years ever to hit the UK have been since the Millennium.

Bad news: 2012 was the second wettest year on record and experts predict floods like this are even more likely

The top five wettest years in the records dating back to 1910 are 2000, 2012, 1954, 2008 and 2002.

It came as Met Office figures also showed the number of days of extreme rainfall is also hitting record levels, meaning the UK can expect more years of floods.

The UK as a whole had 15 per cent more rainfall than average during the year, with England experiencing almost a third more rain than normal.

Overall 2012 was the wettest year on record for 
England and the third wettest for Wales, but Scotland experienced only 
its 17th wettest year and in Northern Ireland it was the 40th wettest.

1.    2000 – 1337.3mm

2.    2012 – 1330.7mm

3.    1954 – 1309.1 mm

4.    2008 – 1295.0mm

5.    2002 – 1283.7mm

Almost 8,000 homes and businesses were flooded last year as the UK was repeatedly battered by heavy rain, storms and floods.

But 2012 began with a number of water companies imposing hosepipe bans as swathes of England faced drought following two dry winters.

The dry weather then gave way to persistent rain, with the UK experiencing a record April and June, and the wettest summer in a century.Farmers’ crops were hit by the unusually wet summer, while much of the UK’s wildlife struggled in the poor conditions, with only a few species including slugs and orchids thriving.

The Met Office said changes in sea surface temperatures as a result of natural cycles and a reduction in the amount of Arctic sea ice could be helping to increase rainfall, but more research needed to be done to establish how big a role they were playing.

Long-term averages over 30-year 
periods show  an increase in annual rainfall of about five per cent from 
1981-2010 when compared to 1961-1990.

It has also been revealed that torrential rain heavy enough to cause flash flooding is on the rise and climate change is probably the cause, a different Met Office study looking at the last 50 years of figures has revealed today.

Official statistics show during the 1960s the heaviest rains of the year fell on an average of one in 125 days a year, but now it is closer to one in 75 days.

The Met Office's chief scientist Julia Slingo says that the frequency of extreme rainfall events in the UK looks to be increasing.

'What this data is telling us is that the nature of our rainfall is changing and what we are seeing is more intense rain, more regularly,' she told MailOnline.

'There’s evidence we are getting slightly more rain in total, but
more importantly it may be falling in more intense bursts – which can 
increase the risk of flooding,' she said.

'What this means is that when it raining there is more potential for more flash floods and surface water floods, like the ones we have seen this year. This means we have to look at the strength of our flood defences and also our drainage systems, including the use of more permeable surfaces.'

Heavy: Warm air allows clouds to pick up more moisture, the Met Office says, as this picture of London's skyline shows during one of many heavy rainstorms in the last year

Rising temperatures are being blamed as for every 0.7 degrees the global
temperatures rises, clouds can hold four per cent more rain, the Met 
Office has said.

'The data we have bears out that warmer air holds more water,' Julia Slingo said.

Friends of the Earth head of policy Mike Childs said climate change was already affecting the UK.

'Four of the five wettest years in the UK have occurred since 2000, and experts including the Met Office expect extreme weather events such as intense rainfall to become more common as global warming takes hold.

'There is still time to tackle climate change. We must end our dependency on dirty fossil fuels and reap the benefits of energy efficiency and developing clean power from the wind, waves and sun.'

The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) warned that despite the wet year, there was a need for a coherent strategy to manage water resources to cope with drought as well as floods, including creating new storage facilities to catch rainfall.

ICE water expert Michael Norton said: 'Without a strategy, we will continue to swing from flooding to drought and climate change will only exacerbate the situation.

'Developing new storage facilities across the country to harvest more rainfall must form part of this strategy - rainfall is becoming more varied in terms of time and place and we can no longer rely on large reservoirs in only a few locations.'

It appears that in the long term, with a mix of years of high rainfall and years of drought.

But the overall trend shows that there has been consistently more heavy rain in the last 50 years.

In the early 1970s there were as few as one in 155 days of the heaviest rainfall, while in in 2000 - the wettest year on record, there were torrential downpours on one in 60 days.

Gardeners can expect longer grass and more daisies and buttercups

Gardeners have been warned to forget about creating the perfect English lawn, with changing weather patterns making it virtually impossible to plan the perfect garden.

Experts fear that summers will become more prone to extreme weather conditions, with torrential rain and prolonged droughts becoming the norm.

Gardeners can expect longer grass and more daisies and daffodils on their lawn as a result.

Drier springs and wetter summers will mean that flowers will also struggle to cultivate in beds and borders.

Met Office experts made the predictions at a recent Royal Horticultural Society Conference.

Retire University of Reading professor Richard Bisgrove, an expert in turf management and garden history, said: 'My own view is that climate change won't affect gardens dramatically but the weather will.

'Nobody can tell one year to the next what we will have.

'In terms of grass, I would say to a large extent that the less effort you put in the better. People should accept a higher cut of grass, more daisies and buttercups.'
