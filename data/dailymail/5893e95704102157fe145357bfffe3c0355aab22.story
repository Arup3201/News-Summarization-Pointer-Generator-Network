Matt Targett, the latest left-back off Southampton's production line, has penned a five-year deal with his boyhood club.

The 19-year-old has impressed since breaking into the first team this season, with his debut coming in August's Capital One Cup defeat of Millwall.

Targett has been rewarded with a new deal until 2019 at a club which has seen Gareth Bale, Wayne Bridge and Luke Shaw flourish after being given a chance at left-back.

'Being a Southampton supporter, it means a lot more to be staying at the club because it's where I want to spend my career,' Targett told Southampton's official YouTube channel.

'I want to get into the first team and to keep progressing by playing week-in week-out.

'Ryan Bertrand is doing a great job this season and has made that left-back spot his own, so I just need to keep working hard in training to keep pushing him.'
