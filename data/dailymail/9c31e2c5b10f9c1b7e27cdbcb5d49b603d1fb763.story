The father of a regular Law and Order: Special Victim's Unit star has been charged in a sex abuse scandal that sounds like a plotline from the show.

Bill Roache, an actor from British soap opera Coronation Street, is charged with forcing young girls to perform sex acts on him in the bathroom of a television studio headquarters.

The 81-year-old actor is the father of Linus Roache, whose American acting credits include frequent appearances on Law and Order: SVU and the role of Thomas Wayne in Batman Begins.

The elder Roache now faces two counts of rape involving a 15-year-old girl in 1967 as well as five indecent assaults involving four girls aged between 11 and 16, between 1965 and 1968.

Prosecutors claim he targeted 'star struck teenagers', including autograph hunters, before attacking them at the Manchester studios where Coronation Street was filmed, in his Rolls Royce and at a house in Lancashire.

When charged with rape, Roache - who 
plays Ken Barlow in the ITV1 show - issued a statement in which he said 
he was 'astounded and deeply horrified' by the accusations.

He
 said: 'I strenuously deny the allegations and will now focus my full 
attention on fighting to preserve my innocence in the challenging times 
ahead.

Like a plotline: The graphic sex acts described in his father's trial sound like something that could have been a storyline for an episode of Law and Order: Special Victim's Unit, where Linus (left) was a regular guest star

'I would like to 
offer my sincere thanks to all those people who have offered me their 
support and good wishes at this difficult time.'

Roache later formally pleaded not guilty to the seven counts he faces.

Two other famed entertainment figures are also on trial today for sexually assaulting young girls, but both Rolf Harris and Dave Lee Travis have entered not guilty pleas.

Harris, a veteran television presenter, is accused of carrying out the historic sex attacks over an 18-year period between 1968 and 1986.

He also faces a further four charges of making indecent photos of a child but is yet to enter pleas.

Travis, a radio DJ, is on trial for allegedly attacking nearly a dozen young women over the course of three decades - including while acting in a pantomime and at the opening of a hospital radio station.

The 68-year-old, whose real name is David Patrick Griffin, faces 13 counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault, dating between 1976 and 2008.

The
 prosecutor said while the case concerned events which happened a long 
time ago, that did not mean the allegations were less important.

'If
 you think a victim of crime has lost the opportunity to complain 
because he or she did not complain at or near the time, please think 
again,' attorney Anne Whyte said in opening statements on Tuesday.

'A crime is a crime, whenever it takes place'.

Setting out the allegations made by five women, the prosecutor said the first complainant in the case contacted the police last March.

Her son had been discussing infamous sex scandals involving Cyril Smith, a now-deceased politician, andÂ  the late BBC presenter Jimmy Saville, and how long it had taken for victims of sexual offences to come forward.

She then told him he had been attacked by Roache and agreed to go to the police.

The victim, aged 15 at the time of the alleged offences in 1967, told police that she was at a house in Lancashire and claimed 'without any preliminaries' was led to a double bedroom and raped.

The prosecutor said: 'He did not attempt to kiss her or sweet-talk her in any way.

'She describes it being uncomfortable and to feeling panic-stricken. She had never had sex before.'

Afterwards it was as if nothing had happened, the court heard.

On screen: The actor's on screen wife, Deidre, played by Anne Kirkbride, will give evidence during the four week trial, the court heard

The second time, at the same house, Roache is alleged to have pushed her against a wall and raped her once more.

'When it was over, she ran out,' Miss Whyte said.

The jury was then told about another alleged victim of Roache's, now aged 63, who was just 14 in 1965 when the actor is said to have indecently assaulted her.

That summer she visited Granada Studios in central Manchester with a friend to take part in a talent show and afterwards she saw Roache in the building and recognised him, Miss Whyte said.

'She was naturally impressed. She and her friend ended up in a dressing room with the defendant and other actors,' the prosecutor said.

He then led her by the arm to the men's toilet, where he allegedly made her commit a sex act on him.

'There was no conversation and they went back to the dressing room where her friend was still chatting to an actor'.

Afterwards, Roache sent her a letter and signed photograph of himself, which will be shown to the jury.

In the dock: Coronation Street star Bill Roache is accused of two counts of rape and five indecent assaults dating back almost 50 years

Attacks: The prosecution say the star enjoyed attacking girls ins in a risky place, 'using his position and fame to try and obtain a continuation of sexual gratification'

But this was not a 'benign personal touch' by a 'well-known young male actor', the court heard.

Instead it was a deliberate act, Miss Whyte said, 'designed to impress a young schoolgirl and to secure her unquestioning loyalty as a fan for a sexual purpose. A sort of grooming, as we would nowadays call it'.

As his four-week trial started today, jurors were told to remember the actor is accused of sex offences - not his much-loved character Ken Barlow.

Mr Justice Holroyde QC said it was important to distinguish between the 'real person' and the part he has played on the ITV soap since its first episode in 1960.

Mr Justice Holroyde said: 'You may feel in one sense you know the defendant, Mr Roache. He is well known as an actor who for many years has played the part of Ken Barlow in Coronation Street.

'But of course this is not the fictional character of Ken Barlow in court. It is a real person, William Roache, who is on trial.

'You must separate the fictional character from the real person, you will have to decide verdicts from the evidence you will hear from a real person, about a real person'.

The world's longest-serving soap actor has not appeared in the programme while the legal proceedings are ongoing.

He
 has been on bail since his arrest with various conditions including 
residence, no direct unsupervised contact with anyone under 16 and not 
to approach named witnesses.
