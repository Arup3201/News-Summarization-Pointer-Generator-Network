We’ve all been there – accidentally swearing in front of a child before realising what we’ve done.

But a new study by Dr. Timothy Jay, a psychologist and expert in swearing, says our efforts to keep our language clean might be futile.

He claims that kids pick up bad language from all over the place and there’s not much you can do about it.

Don't look so surprised: A new study suggests kids are going to learn taboo language whether you like it or not

Dr. Jay, of the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, made the claims in his paper A Child’s Garden of Curses in the American Journal of Psychology.

He discovered that by the age of six, children have a pretty broad vocabulary of swear words.

‘By the 
time children enter school they have the rudiments of adult swearing,’ 
Dr. Jay writes, ‘although children and adults differ in their 
assessments of the inappropriateness of mild taboo words.’

Between the ages of one and two, Dr. Jay found boys knew an average of six taboo words, and girls eight.

By the age of six boys knew 34, while girls were aware of 21.

Our attempts to hide swear words are apparently in vain, but it does help to give the children context for the words.

Namely they are more aware of the social implications of such words, and are thus more likely to remember them, even if they don’t utter them all the time.

To obtain 
the data, one man and six women with training in research methods and 
statistics who had frequent contact with children monitored their 
language over a calendar year.

They
 were insutructed to record all taboo utterances occurring spontaneously
 in context, such as in day care, at school or at a sporting event.

Utterances were to include offensive words and insults or name calling.

They also noted the ages and gender of each child that spoke a taboo word or phrase.

The same study was also done for adults.

In total, 3,190 utterances from adults were recorded - by comparison, children spoke offensive words or phrases 1,187 times, with boys resorting to swear words more often than girls.

For
 three to four-year-olds, words ranged from the tenth popular ‘poophead’
 (heard nine times) to ‘jerk’ at the top end, which was heard 18 times.

As they got older the words became more ‘offensive’ with 11 to 12 year-olds preferring words such as 'f***' and 's***'.

This relates to the second study, where adults and children were asked to rate how ‘bad’ they thought certain words were.

This
 ranged from 100 per cent of children thinking ‘asshole’ was a bad word 
to only 68 per cent thinking ‘Jesus Christ’ had negative connotations.

For adults, ‘bitch’ topped the list with 100 per cent thinking it was bad, while only 44 per cent deemed ‘dork’ offensive.

In the study it was pointed out that swearing need not always carry negative connotations - it can be useful in some instances, such as expressing happiness or surprise

‘As soon as kids start talking, they pick up this kind of language,’ Dr. Jay told NPR.

‘They’re like little language vacuum cleaners, so they repeat what they hear.’

Dr. Jay, however, argues that swearing in front of children is not necessarily a bad thing.

(*Note: some words were omitted at the request of parents and caregivers)

He says it helps them to learn about how adults handle emotion, showing them swearing is just a part of being angry or happy, for example.

It is the parent’s job to teach their children the nuances of swearing, and let them know what is and isn’t appropriate in certain situations.

‘Expect your kids to be angry and frustrated at times, and sometimes this language seems kind of natural to them,’ he says.

But Dr. Jay also views our ability to swear as a beneficial trait in humans.

‘A lot of times you don’t get to the argument about the positive uses of these [words],’ he adds.

‘Their use in humour, their use in bonding, their use as a relief from pain or venting or frustration – I look at this as an evolutionary advantage.

‘Why would we have this language? It must do something for us.'

Dr. Jay, however, does note some limitations in his study.

‘A larger pool of adults and children is necessary for analysis of parent-child or caregiver-child gender interactions,’ he writes.

He also adds that ‘a significant limitation here and in taboo language in general is that the sampling is limited to primarily white, middle-class speakers.’

Perhaps a bar of soap isn't the answer: Dr. Jay says we should teach children when and where it is appropriate to use certain words, and how they can be said in certain context

@highlight

Dr. Timothy Jay's new study monitored swearing in children and adults

@highlight

He found that kids from one to 12 years old picked up taboo language

@highlight

This was despite the efforts of adults in some cases to protect them

@highlight

He says we need to educate children more about the uses of such words

@highlight

But he says we should also highlight that swearing isn't always so bad
