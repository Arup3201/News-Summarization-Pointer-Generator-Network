It was meant to be a tribute to some of the hardest working women in film.

During his opening monologue at the 85th annual Academy Awards, host Seth MacFarlane took a moment to elaborate jokes that showed his bad taste, including a tune titled 'We Saw Your Boobs.'

The Family Guy comedian got the ball rolling with a self-effacing opening monologue that predicted he would go down in history as the worst host ever of the prestigious awards show.

Wild humour: Seth MacFarlane opened the 85th annual Academy Awards with a controversial tune titled 'We Saw Your Boobs'

Alone on the stage, he delivered a series of one-liners, most of which scored, before he rattled off a list of perfunctory celebrity bashing jokes, including one that took a stab at the Academy itself.

He quickly brought up one of the most contentious choices by the Academy this year to not nominate Argo for best director, despite getting nods in all other top categories -- and Ben Affleck's win at the Director's Guild Awards.

'The film is based on classified CIA files.... The story was so top secret that the film's director isÂ  unknown to the academy,' Seth joked.

The stage is all his: Critics predicted the Family Guy creator's humour may be tough to swallow

But then things turned sour as Seth tried to inject some humour into a line about the violent Quentin Tarantino western Django Unchained.

'This is the story of a man fighting to get back his woman, who's been subjected to unthinkable violence -- or as Chris Brown and Rihanna call it, a date movie.'

The energy in the room cooled as the crowd laughed nervously, forcing him to reply with an assurance that the joke was 'as bad as it gets, if it makes you feel better.'

Back from the future: William Shatner, dressed as Captain Kirk, comes from the future to save the show

Ominous prediction: William shows Seth a title from a newspaper the next day

'Oh no, that's what we were afraid he would do,' he said, mimicking the audience's response.

He followed it up with another diss at Tarantino's film -- which he later won an award for Best Screenplay.

Talking
about the film's controversial overuse of the n-word, Seth drew silence
from the crowd when he joked that the screenplay was 'loosely based on 
Mel Gibon's voicemails.'

'What, now you're all on his side?' he asked, clearly showing that he is uncomfortable with criticism.After a few boos, he replied with a promise that 'it's really not as bad as it gets.'

In interviews beforehand, he had spoken of his hope to strike a balance between respect for Hollywood and some necessary sass.

Mission accomplished, as even critics from Vanity Fair lauded the actor.

'Loving that MacFarlane is attempting to preempt his #Oscars criticism,' the magazine posted on their Twitter account Sunday.

Song and dance: William then shows a clip from the show in which Seth sings a song titled 'We Say Your Boobs'

Stifled laughter: His song is met with mixed emotion

But before he can continue on his 
downward spiral, Seth is interrupted by William Shatner dressed as a 
time travelling Captain Kirk, a role he made famous on the Star Trek 
television series.

Shatner immediately criticizes the handsome funnyman in an attempt to stop him from 'destroying the Academy Awards.'

'The show's a disaster. Your jokes are tasteless and inappropriate and everyone ends up hating you,' Shatner forewarned.

He
then showed Seth a copy of a newspaper headline from the day after the 
awards that read 'Seth MacFarlane Worst Oscar host ever.'

Not amuzed: Charlize Theron looked agitated in the pre-recorded bit when he mentioned her role in Monster

We saw her boobs: Naomi Watts drew looks from the audience in the skit

Horrified: Naomi's face nearly went pale as she played along with the joke

Playing innocent, Seth tries to defend himself and asks what he did wrong.

With that, Shatner plays for Seth a pre-taped production number featuring the comedian singing and dancing to a crude tune titled 'We Saw Your Boobs.'

The melody showcases Seth's singing prowess as he's backed by an all men's choir.

Honourable mention: Jennifer Lawrence was also mentioned in the spoof, and she gave a thumbs up

The song, which oft repeated the titular 
phrase, called out actresses in the audience that have exposed their 
chest in some of their most famous roles.

Playing along with the joke, Naomi Watts looked horrified when he mentioned her name.

Next, Charlize Theron bowed her head low and avoided the camera at the mention of her breast-exposing performance in Monster.

But the always jubilant Jennifer Lawrence relished at the nod, giving a glad hands up to the cameras.

Musical theme: There were many musical breaks during the show, many of which Seth partook in

Though it was clear the women were looped into the pre-recorded piece, the reaction from the internet was mixed.

And
in a matter of moments, #WeSawYourBoobs became a popular hashtag on 
Twitter and Seth McFarlane was one of the trending topics on the 
micro-blogging site.

Television host Piers Morgan was quick to show his support for the comedian.

'This is unbelievably, unacceptably, gob-smackingly, hilariously inappropriate. Keep going. @SethMacFarlane #WeSawYourBoobs'

People Magazine also threw in some praise: 'If you're hating on Seth, just remember: He's got Channing up there dancing.'

Dancing with the stars: Seth sang Frank Sinatra's The Way You Look Tonight as Chaning Tatum and Charlize Theron took the stage

Stunning performance: Dustin Hoffman later told Charlize she was a 'beautiful dancer'

On the other side of the fence, celebrity blogger Perez Hilton was one of the most vocal critics of the performance.

'That song @SethMacFarlane did made me wish he just stuck to telling mildly funny jokes! #Oscars,' he wrote.

In an effort to change the course of 
history, he used the remainder of his 15 minutes to redeem himself, 
starting with a sensual dance by Charlize Theron and Channing Tatum to 
his rendition of Frank Sinatra's The Way You Look Tonight.'

Not good enough, said Shatner, who 
then revealed a video clip where MacFarlane, costumed in a Flying Nun 
habit, hit on Oscar nominee Sally Field in the green room.

Stage presence: He did a musical number with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Daniel Radcliff
