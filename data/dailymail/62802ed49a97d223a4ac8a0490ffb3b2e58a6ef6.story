Andrea Flutter, 32, wants to have her PIP breast implants removed because they cause her 'constant discomfort'

A city worker plans to sue over apparently faulty breast implants that cause her 'constant discomfort'.

Andrea Flutter, 32, wants to have the PIP implants removed but is unable to do so because she is pregnant.

She is one of many women involved in a case that lawyers hope to bring against the company that certified the PIP implants as safe.

Ms Flutter aims to secure up to £10,000.

She paid £6,500 to have the implants - made by French company Poly Implant Prostheses - fitted at a Harley Street clinic in February 2009. 

Mrs Flutter chose to boost her chest to an E-cup.

She said: 'I had the implants put in initially because I had different size breasts and it was making me unhappy.

'I'd also been very sporty as a teenager - I used to compete in track events and swimming.

'As a result, my breast tissue had started to sag, so not only did I have breasts that were different sizes, they were sagging too.

'When the bandages were taken off [after the enlargement op] I was initially thrilled with the result. 

'They looked fantastic and for the first time, they were both the same size.'

But her happiness did not last long.

She said: 'I've been in constant discomfort since having the implants put in.

'I went to see the doctor but was told it would settle down - but it never has done.'

Mrs Flutter has had annual mammograms and been assured the implants have not burst, but said: 'I worry about them constantly, about them affecting my health and am planning on getting them out as soon as possible.

'I'm four months pregnant so I can't have them taken out until after the baby is born and that worries me too.'

PIP implants were banned in 2010 when it emerged industrial grade silicone had been used in them and they were twice as likely to rupture.

About 47,000 UK women had PIP implants out of about 300,000 worldwide. 

They were not found to be toxic or carcinogenic but the leaking gel can lead to the formation of scar tissue and cause pain and inflammation.

The Stanton Fisher Group, a firm of financial claims experts, estimates the total payout for women in and around London alone could be millions of pounds.

A legal appeal in France is due to decide this summer if a German firm that certified the implants is safe, TUV Rheinland, can be held liable.

The city worker is hoping to sue over the apparently faulty implants. She wants to have them removed but because she is four months pregnant she will have to wait until her baby is born

In December 2013 PIP chief executive Jean-Claude Mas was jailed for four years for fraud but many women were denied compensation because the firm was insolvent.

Stanton Fisher is working with a French lawyer which led the initial court action against TUV, which found it had failed in its duty of vigilance. 

TUV claims it was a victim of fraud and a cover up by the French firm. 

Its lawyers argue that the firm was expected only to check PIP's paperwork.

Women have until Friday 20, March to contact Stanton Fisher about a potential claim.
