Real Madrid star Gareth Bale put his foot in it on Friday as he accidentally ran over a woman's foot as he made his way out of the club's training ground among a crowd of his supporters.

The Welshman has taken time to sign autographs and pose for photos with large numbers of fans while leaving the Valdebebas training base this week.

However, the crowds proved a step too far for Bale this time around as he looked to navigate his Audi car out of the training ground, only to clip the foot of a female supporter in the process.

Spanish TV cameras and other people come to the attention of the lady after the incident

The former Tottenham winger has already had a spot of bother with Madrid fans this season, as two young lads kicked out at his car after he drove home without stopping to acknowledge them.

Luckily there was no immediate damage to the woman, who told Spanish TV cameras after the incident that despite feeling a little bit of pain, she had forgiven the 25-year-old for his part in the collision.

Elsewhere, on the field Bale and his team-mates face a trip to Villarreal on Saturday as they look to close the four-point gap Seville have established early on in La Liga so far this season.
