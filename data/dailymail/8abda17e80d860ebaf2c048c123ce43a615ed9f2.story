Guus Hiddink began his second stint as Holland coach by promising to carry on Louis van Gaal's ethos of playing  attractive but practical football.

Hiddink took over from the new Manchester United boss after the World Cup, where the Oranje impressed on their way to third place.

The native boss, who presided in an awkward-looking photoshoot on a bench with assistants Danny Blind and Ruud van Nistelrooy, said he wants to combine the 'Dutch school' of attacking and possession-based play with 'the instinct to survive'.

He praised Van Gaal for mixing the two styles successfully at the World Cup, and hinted that he would attempt to do the same.

'I applaud the whole team, which performed excellently,' he said. 'It was a very realistic approach there (in Brazil).'

He declined to give specifics of his likely team selections, noting that Van Gaal had brought in a crop of talented youngsters to mix with veteran stars such as Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben.

'That policy will be continued,' he said. 'I'm not going to get further into names.'

The Netherlands begin their European Championship qualifying campaign in Czech Republic on September 9.

Hiddink is highly regarded as the most successful coach ever within the Netherlands, winning six league and four cup titles with PSV Eindhoven. He coached the Netherlands from 1995-98, reaching the semi-finals at the World Cup in France.

He has coached Real Madrid and Chelsea, and led South Korea and Australia to best-ever performances in the 2002 and 2006 World Cups.

All he's praying for now is a bigger bench...
