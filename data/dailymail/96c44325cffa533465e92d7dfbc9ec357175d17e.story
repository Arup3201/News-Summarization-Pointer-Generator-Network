The Longleat Estate is well known for its wild life – both in the safari park and the aristocratic owner’s bedroom.

Now the Marquess of Bath’s nephew has added a darker shade to the family’s colourful reputation – by growing 26  cannabis plants in his grace and favour cottage.

Alexander Thynne, 50, kept a stash of other drugs, including ecstasy and magic mushrooms, at his home on the estate.

But the son of Lord Bath’s younger brother has managed to avoid jail and has instead been handed a drug rehabilitation order and told to pay £85 in costs.

The police raid on his home is not the first time officers have helped add to visitor numbers at the stately home set in 10,000 acres in Wiltshire.

Last summer, they were called in the middle of the night to intervene in an alleged fight between two of Lord Bath’s ‘wifelets’, who were said to have come to blows over which of them would be sharing a bed with the bearded 7th Marquess, now 80.

Nor is it the first time Thynne, who is described as an ‘artist’, has had his knuckles rapped over drugs.

He has spoken previously of his 
‘drugs problem’ and of indulging in ‘too much partying’ after being 
caught with ecstasy in his car.

Officers subsequently found 42 cannabis plants and other drugs worth more than £3,000 at his cottage.

On
that occasion he also escaped a prison term after pleading guilty to 
one charge of cultivating cannabis and five drug possession charges.

When the case was heard in February 2003 he was sentenced to 180 hours of community punishment and ordered to pay £118 in costs.

His
lawyer later issued a statement appearing to promise that Thynne was a 
changed man, saying ‘his past is now very much in the past’. 

Thynne himself said: ‘I feel very lucky.’ But he was back in court the following year after police seized cannabis at his home.

Life is seldom dull on the Longleat Estate owned by the 7th Marquess of Bath, a descendant of the Roman historian Tacitus.His bedroom is covered in scenes from the Kama Sutra and he has often boasted about his numerous female admirers.

He married Hungarian-born actress Anna Gael in 1969 and they have two children.But the man sometimes known as ‘the Loins of Longleat’ is also famous for his ‘wifelets’ – rumoured to have numbered as many as 75 – and said to be ‘former glamour girls, actresses, singers and aspiring models’.

A recent biography of Lord Bath, whose wealth is estimated at £157million, said a ‘woman on either side of him in bed’ every night is a basic requirement.

Longleat House was completed in 1580 and is set in parkland landscaped by ‘Capability’ Brown in the 18th century. A safari park with lions was opened in 1966.

He admitted possession of cannabis, was fined £160 and ordered to pay £43 costs.

Thynne’s most recent brush with the 
law came after officers raided his home in Corsley, Wiltshire, in March 
and found 26 cannabis plants in a cupboard.

They then discovered stashes of class 
A, B  and C drugs kept in other rooms of the house provided for him by 
Lord Bath, including ecstasy and magic mushrooms.

Thynne claimed he no longer used the magic mushrooms and had forgotten about the ecstasy which he bought at a party.

Michael Willis, defending, told North 
West Wiltshire magistrates’ court in Chippenham: ‘He had a history of 
use and abuse when he was a young man, but he does not supply and he 
wants to get rid of this awful habit.’

As well as the drug 
rehabilitation order and costs, Thynne was given a nine-month community 
order.

It is not known whether he has a job, 
but during one of his earlier court appearances he was said to have been
working with a team creating mosaics for the ceilings of Lord Bath’s 
apartments at Longleat House for £6 an hour.

He is said to have smoked cannabis 
since the age of 16, having grown up with his mother in North Africa and
not meeting his aristocratic relatives until he was 14.

He was given a cottage on the Longleat Estate in 1992.

His father, Lord Christopher Thynne, 
made headlines in 1992 following a major feud with his brother, Lord 
Bath. The colourful Lord Bath sacked Christopher as a manager of 
Longleat shortly after inheriting his title.
