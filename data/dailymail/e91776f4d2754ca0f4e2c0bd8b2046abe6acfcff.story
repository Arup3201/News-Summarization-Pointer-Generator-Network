Heathrow Airport today promised to repair a widow's house after a passing jet created a rare and powerful 'vortex' that blasted tiles off of her roof.

Grandmother-of-four Patricia Hills was left with three large holes - with shattered tiles thrown as far as 20ft away from her home.

Some even smashed the headlights and dented the front of a neighbour's car.

Damage: Heathrow Airport today promised to repair Patricia Hills' house after a passing jet created a rare and powerful 'vortex' that blasted tiles off her roof

Strewn: Shattered tiles were scattered as far as 20ft away from the house. Mrs Hills, who is in her seventies, said the 'vortex' gust left the scene outside looking like a 'warzone'

Flights: A large number of airlines, including British Airways, operate out of Heathrow - which is one of the world's busiest airports

Mrs Hills, who is in her seventies, said the 'vortex' gust left the scene outside her home looking like a 'warzone'. She now fears for her safety at the house in Old Windsor, Berkshire - which is under Heathrow's flightpath.

Describing the incident - which happened at about 6pm - the retired concert pianist said: 'I heard this huge explosion and thought it was a clap of thunder.

'Then a neighbour came rushing over and said 'did you know there is a hole in your roof?''

Mrs Hills, who called the fire brigade, added: 'They were marvellous and helped clear away the worst of the debris. It looked like a war zone before they arrived. This has left me feeling frightened and alone.'

Fears: She said the incident, in Old Windsor, Berkshire, has left her feeling 'frightened and alone'

They also put up a cordon around the front of the house to keep people safe.

Neighbour Peter Green said: 'Our houses are semi-detached so I must have been about 15 yards away from where it happened.

'I heard it clearly in my study. It sounded like a whoosh, then a loud bang and clattering as tiles scattered everywhere.'

Wingtip vortices are rotating air left behind by a wing as it generates lift. Their intensity or strength depends on aircraft's size, speed and whether it has its flaps or landing gear down.

They cause 'wake turbulence' for other aircraft and, in rare cases, can damage buildings.

Mr Green - who is himself an airline pilot - initially thought the damage had been caused by ice from an incoming plane.

But an investigation by airport operator BAA concluded the damage had not be caused by a solid object but by a 'wave of vortex.'

That is a gust of swirling air that can follow an aircraft and in rare instances cause this sort of damage.

A spokesman for BAA said an assessor had been to Mrs Hills' house and the company will now send men around to replace her damaged roof.

He said: 'It is rare, but we have a policy of carrying out repairs where this has happened to people.'

Mrs Hills said: 'BAA have acted honourably and I'm very pleased at their quick response.'

It is not known which plane was responsible or at what height it was flying.
