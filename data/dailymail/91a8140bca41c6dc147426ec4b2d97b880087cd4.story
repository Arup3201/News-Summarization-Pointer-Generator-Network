Motorcyclist Greg Edwards narrowly escaped with his life when a driver who ran a red light hit him, catapulting him into the air and crushing his leg at a Colorado intersection. 

But two years after the horror crash, the 53-year-old's leg hasn't fully healed and will be amputated 'two inches from the knee'.

Rather than blame the young driver or feel sorry for himself, the Navy veteran hopes his story will inspire other motorists to take care on the road.

'I’m not going to hold a grudge against anybody. I just thank the man above I’m still alive,' he told CBS.

Lucky to be alive: Greg Edwards was riding his motorbike through the intersection at Chambers and Iliff in Colorado when he was hit by a car and thrown off his bike

A red light camera captured the horrific April 2012 accident which is claiming Edwards' leg.

The footage, released by Aurora Police, showed Edwards had right of way when he rode his motorcycle 
through the intersection at S. Chambers Rd and East Iliff Ave in Aurora,
 Fox 31 reported.

But
 about nine seconds after the light went red for drivers at the cross 
street, a car driven by 20-year-old Chante Thomas plowed through 
oncoming traffic and struck Edwards.

The shocking video shows Edwards being tossed into the air and falling head first.

Edwards suffered a broken ankle and femur, needed stitches and even wound up with some broken teeth.

'I’m just blessed that I’m alive right now,' Edwards told Fox 31 from a hospital bed at Medical Center of Aurora.

Edwards, who was wearing a full-shield motorcycle helmet and a riding jacket with padding when he was hit, said his gear saved his life.

'It really paid off - the full shield helmet,' Edwards told Denver Post. 'When I got airborne, I hit face first.'

Losing a leg: After two years of painful therapy and treatment, crash victim Greg Edwards will have to have his leg amputated

Forgiving: Although Greg Edwards is going to have his injured leg amputated 'two inches from the knee', he doesn't harbor a grudge toward the young driver who crashed into him

The driver of the car, Chante Thomas, was ticketed, and denied that she was using her cell phone when she ran a red light.

'I'm really glad he's (Edwards) is OK,' she told Fox 31.

Aurora Police Lt. Jeff Turner said 'it's not fair' that Edwards lost a leg while Thomas was merely ticketed.

'Certainly the one person got more serious consequences than the other. But that’s our judicial system,' he told CBS.
