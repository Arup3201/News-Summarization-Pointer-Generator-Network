Heather Atkinson, 27, waged a hate campaign against her former lover after she heard she had started seeing a mutual friend, a court heard today

A police officer involved in a 'lesbian love triangle' terrorised her former lover after she heard she had started seeing a mutual friend, it has today been revealed.

Heather Atkinson, 27, began to harass her ex-partner Lauren Jenkins after she spotted her and her new partner Nicola Porteous as they drove through their hometown of Greenock, Inverclyde, a court heard.

A jury was told during a two day trial in June that she had followed them, leading to a terrifying high speed chase over 13 miles. 

The pair only managed to escape after racing away at 80mph during the incident last year.

Atkinson, of Greenock, also assaulted her 23-year-old former partner after they took a day trip to Loch Thom in June last year.

During the trial a jury heard Atkinson had also told Miss Jenkins’s mother that her daughter wasgay and they had been together for three years despite her girlfriend’s pleas for the relationship to be kept secret.

She denied causing Miss Jenkins fear and alarm by her conduct at various times in 2012 and assaulting her at Loch Thom, at Greenock Sheriff Court.

But she was found guilty and today appeared for sentencing.

However Sheriff Rajni Swanney deferred sentence for good behaviour and ordered Atkinson to return to court in March next year.

Miss Jenkins had earlier told of her ordeal at Atkinson’s hands.

She said: 'I was really scared as we thought Heather would crash into us.

'She pulled up beside us and it was clear she was angry as she was pointing and shouting.

'There were points when she was dangerously close to me in the car.'

She cried as she told the jury how Atkinson had wanted to reveal their relationship.

She said: 'She wanted to speak to my mum to tell her about our relationship and cause upset. My mum was devastated.

'We have a strong mother-daughter bond and Heather tried to break that.

'She always promised to change and I believed her. I was very naive.'

Miss Jenkins' mother Elizabeth, 55, told the court she had no idea her daughter and Atkinson were ina relationship until she took the telephone call.

She said: 'I thought it was a friendship. There was a closeness between the two of them.

'I received a phone call from Heather saying they had been in a relationship for the last three years.

'I said, ‘That explains a lot of things’.'

Lauren was today unavailable for comment.

Atkinson refused to comment as she left court.

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said a report on Atkinson would be sent to the force’s deputy chief constable.
