A primatologist has demonstrated her commitment to her job as well as her fiancée by getting married in a treehouse.

Olivia Haggis and her new husband Charles-Albert Petre tied the knot in the magnificent giant oak structure before jetting off just eight days later to study chimps in the remote Congolese jungle.

Sticking with the unconventional theme, they continued monkeying around by planting a tree and having 'Monkey Song' played during the ceremony.

The two primate lovers incorporated their passion for monkeys into their special day, even playing the 'Monkey Song' during the ceremony

Olivia, 33, from Devon said: 'When we saw the tree house had a license for civil marriages we just knew it was the perfect place for our big day.'

The scientist - an expert on neuroscience - wanted a venue to reflect her love of nature.

So, instead of settling for a traditional church service or remote beach wedding, she spent months hunting for the ideal place to get married.

But by the time she finally found the perfect location the bride had just eight weeks to plan the wedding.

She and new husband Charles-Albert, 33, from Belgium, were joined by 14 guests seated on the balcony outside as the registrar pronounced them man and wife.

Olivia has previously worked in Madagascar studying lemurs and Cameroon following gorillas.

Along with her conservationist husband, she's now in the Congo studying Bonobos - a type of chimp - for the WWF on a two year project.

The couple are the first to get married in the luxury treetop house - normally an unusual holiday home - at the Fox and Hounds hotel in Chulmleigh, Devon.

The couple say it would be their dream to live in a treehouse in the jungle among the monkeys 

Olivia said: 'We only had eight weeks before leaving for Africa and had almost given up finding the perfect setting.

'When I found the treehouse I knew I'd found the place - the location up in the branches of a stunning oak tree couldn't have been more appropriate.

'It just seemed perfect for us as we both love nature.

'We met while working in the forest in Cameroon and would love to build and live in a tree house in Africa in the future.

'As primatologists living up in the trees with the monkeys would be ideal!'

Mother of the bride Amanda Haggis, 67, said: 'It was a brilliant day - Olivia couldn't have found a better location.

'She's always been interested in primates and Africa and She just wanted something different so it was perfect coincidence.

'She's been all over the world, sometimes chasing gorillas or studying lemurs so a treehouse where everything is made out of wood was perfect.'

Gill Churchill who runs the events at The Fox and Hounds hotel helped the couple put the finishing touches to their wedding.

She said: 'We were delighted to be able to host such a special day in our brand new tree house and the tree planting means Olivia and Charles-Albert will always be part of this amazing space.'
