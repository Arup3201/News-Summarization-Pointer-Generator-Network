When Houston-based photographer Krista Steinke had a child, it opened up a whole new dimension to her work.

The new mom decided to recreate versions of nursery rhythms and fairytales that blurred the line between fantasy and reality.

Enter her most recent body of work, Backyards, BB Guns and Nursery Rhymes.

'The children in my photographs appear to be in the midst of some kind of mischief, trouble, or state of uncertainty,' Steinke explained.

'As we peer through this window, are we the big bad wolf, the girl, the woodsman, or grandma?

Alot of the photos have been merged with vintage Super 8mm film stock, creating an eerie feeling and a world of make believe.
