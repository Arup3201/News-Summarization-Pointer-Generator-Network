Sony is set to take on the cable and satellite firms by turning its Playstation 4 console into a 'super set top box' that combines live TV and catchup services.

The web-based TV service, PlayStation Vue, is expected to be commercially launched during the first quarter of 2015, and will also be available on the iPad and other devices.

It allows users to access live TV and on-demand content without a cable or satellite service, the company said.

The service offers catch-up and on-demand TV. 

It makes the past three days of popular programming available without the need to schedule recordings, the company said.

During the invite-only beta, PlayStation Vue will initially offer around 75 channels per market from major programmers, such as CBS, Discovery Communications, Fox, NBCUniversal, Scripps Networks Interactive and Viacom.

PlayStation Vue will begin an invite-only beta preview during November for select PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 owners, with a phased rollout starting in New York followed by Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, the company said.

The service will also be available on iPad shortly thereafter, and later on to more Sony and non-Sony devices.

'Everyday TV is about to become extraordinary with our new cloud-based TV service, PlayStation Vue,' said Andrew House, President and Group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment 

'PlayStation Vue reinvents the traditional viewing experience so your programming effortlessly finds you, enabling you to watch much more of what you want and search a lot less. 

Users can choose programmes by channel, and see all of the available episodes for each show as well as watch them live.

They can also easily search shows to find new programmes  they may like.

'PlayStationVue brings the best of live TV and a robust catalog of the latest content, always keeping you connected to what's popular, new and trending.  

Pricing and packaging details will be revealed at commercial launch but PlayStation™Vue is changing the rules for how people pay for subscription TV.
