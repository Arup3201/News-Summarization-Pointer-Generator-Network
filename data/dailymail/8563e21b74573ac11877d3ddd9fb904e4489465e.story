A mother whose son was mauled by a dog today called for a change in the law after police said they could not take any action because the attack happened on private property.

Mother-of-four Alana Chambers, 32, was horrified when Keiran, nine, was savaged by the German shepherd cross at a friend’s house.

The dog clamped its jaws around the boy’s face before tearing a chunk out of his top lip and slashing his cheek with its paw.

Alana reported the incident to Cambridgeshire Police, but was told they were powerless to act because the incident occurred on private property.

Currently, police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people if the attack happens in public and they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs.

But the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is now trying to change the law to allow prosecutions to take place.

After the unprovoked attack on October 4, Keiran was rushed to hospital where he was put under anaesthetic for an hour and needed several stitches to his face.

Mrs Chambers slammed Cambridgeshire Police for 'not caring' about her son and called for an immediate change to the law.

She said: 'The law is ridiculous. It basically means that if a dog attacks someone on private land nothing can be done to put the animal down.

'At the end of the day, it should be on merit of the bite not where the attack happens.

'If the bite had happened 8ft from where it did, the dog would have been taken and put down because it would have been on a public path. It’s just ridiculous.'

Mrs Chambers claims the attack was 'completely unprovoked' after her son went to stroke the animal.

She added: 'I want the owner and the 
police to do what’s right by my child and stop the dog from attacking 
anyone else in the future.

'The way the police treated us was disgusting. They would not even come out to see us to make sure he was OK.

'They
did not care about my son and just said there would never be a law 
change because they would get too many calls from postmen.

'If my son had been attacked by a person the attacker would be arrested so why can't action be taken against an animal.'

Keiran was at the home of a friend in Cambridge when he was attacked by the animal.

Mrs Chambers said she was shocked when the couple, who were her friends, refused to take any action against the dog.

She added: 'They were great at first. But when I told them they needed to do something about the dog they just ignored me - it is a dangerous creature and might attack someone else.

'It could have killed my son and it is still roaming around.

'It is just so shocking if it was by my pet I would have it put down immediately - it is a real risk to other children.'

A spokesman for Cambridgeshire Police said: 'If a dog bites someone on private property it is a civil matter between the owner of the dog and the victim.

'We did receive a call regarding this incident and both parties were given advice.'

Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, dog owners cannot be prosecuted if their animal attacks someone on private property.

However, Defra are considering a change to the law to give courts the the power to jail dog owners for two years or impose a £5,000 fine if animals cause injuries while ‘dangerously out of control’ in their own homes.
