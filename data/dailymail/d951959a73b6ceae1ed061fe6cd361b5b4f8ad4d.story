Nigel Farage has been forced to defend Ukip’s record on using Brussels expenses, insisting he uses the public money to campaign for Britain to leave Europe.

The Ukip leader said he had ‘no idea’ how much he has claimed since becoming an MEP, despite previously boasting it topped £2million.

And he again sought to justify having his wife Kirsten on the payroll, insisting no-one else has ‘anything like the workload that I've got’.

Ukip has sought to exploit the resignation of Culture Secretary Maria Miller over her expenses to fuel an ‘anti-politicians’ backlash.

Mrs Miller was ordered to repay £5,800 in overclaimed mortgage expenses and found to have broken the MPs’ code of conduct in her belligerent attitude towards the independent parliamentary standards commissioner.

The offence was compounded when the Culture Secretary delivered a curt 32-second apology in the Commons.

Last night Mr Farage insisted Mrs Miller’s constituents should have the right to trigger a by-election to remove her as an MP.

But in an interview on Channel 4 News he was repeatedly challenged about his own claims.

In 2009 Mr Farage boasted that he had claimed a ‘vast sum’ in allowances, claiming it ‘must be pushing £2million’.

Asked how much he has claimed since then, Mr Farage replied: ‘No idea. Less than most MPs, but no idea what the total figure is.

‘The system in Brussels is entirely different, more lax than in Westminster, but we operate on a system of allowances and not expenses.’

He insisted he had not benefitted ‘personally’ from the generous allowances on offer in Brussels, and Ukip had not broken the rules.

Mr Farage told newsreader Jon Snow: ‘If you are accusing me and UKIP of taking the wherewithal provided by the European Parliament for us as MEPs, and using it politically to campaign against Britain's membership of the European Union, and you think that is wrong, that is you decision.

‘That is quite different. It is different from benefiting personally.

‘We haven’t broken the rules of the European Parliament. We have been very careful at using our lawyers and using our accountants to dot the Is and cross the Ts.

‘But be in no doubt that we use the money to fight Britain’s membership.

'There is nothing I've done with my expenses in 15 years that has been done for personal gain. I've not breached the rules for personal gain.

'I haven't bought a house and made £1 million, what I have done is to try and publicise across this country the extent to which membership of this union is damaging this country. I would like to think I haven't done a bad job of that.'

Mr Farage was also challenged over his decision to pay his wife Kirsten using public money.

He said: ‘She’s paid a very modest sum of money, just over £25,000 a year.

‘I very much doubt that there is any other British MEP who has anything like the workload that I've got.

‘She did it unpaid for seven years. She 
has done it, paid a modest sum, for the last seven years. That 
arrangement will end in a few weeks' time.’

Last month Mr Farage denied that Annabelle Fuller, an aide also on the public payroll, was his former mistress.

Ukip has been hit by a number of expenses scandals, including MEP Tom Wise who was jailed for two years after fraudulently claiming £39,000.

Mr Farage conceded: ‘There are two cases of UKIP MEPs who behaved badly and acted dishonestly.

‘In both cases I got rid of them from the party before any investigation was finished by the outside authorities or any prosecutions were brought. I dealt the problem as soon as I saw it.’

He contrasted his actions with Mr Cameron’s determination to cling on to Mrs Miller for almost a week after her Commons apology.

‘I think the real issue with the Maria Miller case - apart from the fact the taxpayer helped her make a profit of £1 million - but the real issue is that David Cameron has supported her all of the way through and now he is saying he will have her back in the Cabinet as soon as he can.

‘You will find in every political party people who do things that are wrong, but the question is how you deal with it.’
