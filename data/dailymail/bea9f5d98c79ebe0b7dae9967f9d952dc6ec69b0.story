When you think of fine dining, McDonald's is probably not at the top of your list, but that didn't stop a group of chefs attempting to turn the chain's fast food into gourmet cuisine.

With creations ranging from kung pao Chicken McNuggets to tapas and slow-cooked beef with Mac Fry gnocchi, the foods appeared to be worlds apart from the usual fast food fare of burgers and fries found at the golden arches.

Award-winning chefs Dale Talde, of Brooklyn’s Talde, James Tahhan of Telelmundo fame, The Next Food Network Star winner Aaron McCargo Jr and McDonald’s in-house chef Jessica Foust all competed against each other at an event in New York to create some exotic dishes.

The transformation wizardry didn't stop at the food either. Among the drinks being offered were a mango pineapple mojito, made with the mango smoothie base, and a bacon old fashioned.

The first dish, from Chef Talde, was kung pao Chicken McNuggets. Three nuggets doused in sweet and sour sauce, rice wine vinegar and peanuts atop a small bed of shredded Big Mac lettuce with sliced orange, according to Thrillist.

Next up was Chef Tahhan’s tortilla espanola. Made with McDonald’s hash browns and eggs, combined with both chipotle BBQ and honey mustard sauces, as well as a garlic and saffron aioli, Thrillist called it ‘the most transformative dish of the night.’

‘You could tell it was McDonald's ingredients,’ the site added, ‘but it didn't taste like anything on the actual menu.’

The next dish was the one most likely to end up on a McDonald’s menu.

From Chef McCargo, it boasted sliced crispy chicken stacked on top of hash browns and topped with a fried egg, jack cheddar cheeses and applewood smoked bacon on a bed of chipotle BBQ sauce and espresso.

Ideas unlimited: Event provided diners with a new perspective on McDonald's food and quality ingredients

Variety: The evening included cocktails, appetizers and several entrees

Chef Foust, perhaps due to her unparalleled and intimate knowledge of ingredients at the fast food giant, created what appeared to be the two best dishes of the night.

The first was a slow-cooked beef with blueberry pomegranate sauce and Mac Fry gnocchi.

The blueberries and pomegranates come from the smoothies and the fries were turned into a potato gnocchi.

The slow-cooked beef was the same meat used by the fast food chain prior to turning it into burger meat.

Dessert looked just as mouthwatering as Chef Foust made a doughnut from the chain’s biscuit mix and topped it with pumpkin spice latte syrup.

But don’t hold your breath and expect these new creations to be on the menu at your local McDonalds - it was strictly a one-off event, one that truly provided food for thought!
