Shares in London hit their highest level since the turn of the century last night in a boost to investors and those saving for a pension.

The FTSE 100 rose 41.08 points to 6898.13 – the second best close of all time and just 32 points off the all-time high of 6930 reached in December 1999 during the dotcom boom.

Britain's index of blue chip companies has gained 5 per cent this year – adding £84billion to the value of investments – and has nearly doubled since the depths of the recession in 2009.

The increase in share prices was described as 'great news' for investors in the stock market and workers saving for a pension. Millions of families have money tied up in the stock market through pension funds, ISAs and other savings.

The benchmark, which includes corporate giants from Tesco and Rolls-Royce to Vodafone and Barclays, is now within touching distance of the record high it reached during the dotcom boom.

The rally will fuel speculation that the Footsie could finally reach the 7000 mark this year – particularly if the economic recovery continues.  

The latest gains in London came despite worries over Greece and its future in the eurozone as the Athens government clashed with European leaders over austerity and debt.

George Godber, a fund manager at Miton Group, said he was 'very surprised' at the strength of the stock market – particularly given the ructions in Greece.

Shares in London have been buoyed by the recovery in the UK economy which last year clocked up the fastest rate of growth of any major industrialised nation.

Economists are predicting another good year in 2015 which could in turn boost share prices as corporate profits rise.

Economists are predicting another good year in 2015 which could in turn boost share prices as corporate profits rise.

Official figures yesterday showed inflation in the UK has fallen to its lowest level for 55 years – making households feel richer as wages rise faster than prices.

It is hoped that the slump in the price of essentials such as food and petrol will fuel the feel-good factor this year.

Savers fed up with paltry returns on their nest eggs, as a result of record low interest rates, have also been attracted to the stock market.

Tony Cross, a market analyst at online trading firm Trustnet Direct, said: 'This is great news for anyone saving for a pension or with investments in the stock market.

'The fact the FTSE 100 has posted its highest close this century is offering some much-needed respite for those investors who have backed equities.

'Add the record low borrowing rates to falling food and fuel prices, and it's shaping up to be a great year for UK consumers - even if the picture looks somewhat more downbeat on the Continent.'

John Redwood, chief economist at stock broking firm Charles Stanley, said: 'Shares have risen because interest rate are low, the UK economy is growing faster than most of the advanced world, and companies are benefiting from improving business conditions.

'The lower oil price is boosting spending on other items which is also good for growth.'

But others are less confident. Crispin Odey, one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the UK, last month warned that major economies are entering a recession that will be 'remembered in a hundred years'.

Mr Odey, who is the founder of Odey Asset Management and made millions after correctly predicting the credit crunch, predicted that shares 'will get devastated'.
