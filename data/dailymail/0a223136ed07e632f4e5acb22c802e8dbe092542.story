Christian Siriano has refuted Melissa McCarthy’s claims that she ‘couldn’t find anybody’ to make a dress for her to wear to the 2012 Academy Awards.

The New York City-based fashion designer - who won the fourth season of Project Runway in 2007 - told the New York Daily News that he ‘met with her people’ and attempted to collaborate with Ms McCarthy, 43, on an Oscars gown.

‘Quite frankly she was quite difficult to work with,’ Mr Siriano said of actress, who had been nominated as Best Supporting Actress for her role in Bridesmaids.

Final result: Mrs McCarthy did not wear Mr Siriano's designs to the 2012 Academy Awards and instead chose this pink gown by Marina Rinaldi

He added: ‘She wanted some specific 
things that I thought would not look good on her body. And she was not 
comfortable with them in the end.’

Ms McCarthy ended up wearing a pale pink dress by Marina Rinaldi for the event instead – a choice that won her mixed reviews from fashion pundits.

Mr
 Siriano’s comments follow those made by Ms McCarthy in the June issue 
of Redbook magazine in which she said: ‘Two Oscars ago, I couldn’t find 
anybody to do a dress for me. I asked five or six designers–very 
high-level ones who make lots of dresses for people–and they all said 
no.’

Recent looks: Ms McCarthy wore a leather dress to the LA premiere of her new film Tammy last week (left) and a sequined cardigan and jumpsuit by an unknown designer to the film's New York City premiere on June 26 (right)

Since then, though, it 
seems she has won over the fashion set. Just last week, she won praise 
for her appearance at the Tammy premiere in Los Angeles for which she wore a 
leather-and-chiffon dress with leopard print Tabitha Simmons heels.

On June 26 she wore a sequined cardigan over a black silk jumpsuit to the film's New York City premiere. The designer of both ensembles has yet to be revealed.

In
 the interview the mother-of-two, married to Ben Falcone since 2005, 
also alluded to the possibility of her creating a plus-size fashion 
label.

‘When I go shopping, most of the time I’m disappointed,’ she said.

Providing criticism: Mr Siriano first rose to fame in 2007 as the winner of the fourth season of Project Runway (pictured)

The
 venture would represent her longstanding interest in fashion. As a 
teenager, she had aspirations of attending New York’s Fashion Institute 
of Technology – a dream that her parents ultimately refused in favor of
 a more academic education.

Their
 efforts appear to have been in vain though. She briefly attended the 
Southern Illinois University before dropping out to move to New York 
City and try her luck at a stand-up comedy career.

Ms McCarthy was also friends with the now-famous footwear designer Brian Atwood and the pair remain close today.
