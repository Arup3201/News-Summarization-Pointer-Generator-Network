Manchester United have experienced two very different pre-seasons over the last two summers.

While David Moyes suffered defeats by poor opposition - losing 1-0 to the Singha All Stars, as well as being beated by Yokohama and going down 3-1 at home to Sevilla - new boss Louis van Gaal has beaten some of the best teams in world football.

Unbeaten during the side's tour of America with wins over Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Roma, the Dutchman put even bigger smiles on the faces of the United faithful as he masterminded a 3-1 victory over arch-rivals Liverpool to land the International Champions Cup in Miami on Monday.

While Van Gaal, fresh from guiding Holland to the World Cup semi-finals in Brazil, is giving United fans reasons to be optimistic, Moyes' pre-season of 2013 gave supporters the very opposite feeling.

Anxious following the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson, the man who had delivered two decades of success to Old Trafford, they were worried further as Moyes lost his first game in charge of United to the Singha All-Star XI in Bangkok.

The Red Devils went on to beat the A-League All Stars 5-1 but then lost 3-2 to Yokohama F Marinos and were also defeated by Sevilla during Rio Ferdinand's testimonial.

The far from convincing pre-season set the tone for the campaign as Moyes endured a disastrous time in the Old Trafford hotseat.

Eventually finishing the season in seventh place having failed to qualify for Europe, United sacked Moyes in April - two days after the Scot had lost to former club Everton - as the then defending champions suffered their worst season of the Premier League era.

Precedent? Moyes' poor pre-season carried on into the new campaign as United failed to qualify for Europe

While Moyes suffered defeat in his first friendly in charge of United, Van Gaal got off to the perfect possible start with a resounding 7-0 victory over LA Galaxy.

The Red Devils played scintilating football, new signing Ander Herrera gave a virtuoso performance, pulling the strings in midfield and the football world, prematurely, got excited about the new era of success United were about to embark on.

It would be foolish to say United have returned to title-winning form off the back of five victories during a pre-season tour but the signs look positive.

It's fair to say the 
side's results this summer, along with the new 3-5-2 formation Van Gaal 
has implemented with relative success, have given the United faithful 
plenty to be optimistic about for the upcoming campaign.

The
 side under Van Gaal has scored the same number of goals as Moyes' 
charges last term but are certainly much tighter at the back having 
conceded nine fewer.

'King
 Louis' also seems to be getting the best out of the players who 
under-performed last term; most notably Ashley Young. The wideman 
struggled under the previous stewardship but has shone, and 
scored, in America.

Meanwhile, talisman Rooney, who is likely 
to be given the captain's armband, appears to be playing with a new 
lease of life and a smile on his face.

Rooney has said Van Gaal has invigorated the United squad and given players a different way of looking at the game.

United's No 10 told the Manchester Evening News: ‘It's been a good few weeks, we've 
got a new manager who wants us to play a different style of football. 
We've had to adapt. We've had some good results against top opposition 
so we can be pleased.

‘I
 think the system suits the team, not only myself. The manager came in 
and had a look at the players we've got. He's done what he thinks is 
best suited for our team.

‘He's
 a tough manager but he's been great since he came in. He's given us all
 a different way of looking at football, which we haven't had before.'

If pre-season is anything to go by, Manchester United will have no problems mounting a title challenge this season, with Valencia at home the final game of the club's preparations ahead of the next term.

However, friendly records will mean nothing once the season is underway.

Having passed all of the tests so far, the real judgements will be made on Van Gaal when Manchester United kick-off the new Barclays Premier League season against Swansea on August 16.

Only then will we know of the true impact the Dutchman has had on a squad which struggled so often under Moyes.
