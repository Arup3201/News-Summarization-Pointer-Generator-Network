Jonas Gutierrez scored his first goal after beating testicular cancer and admitted that he is enjoying his football more than ever.

The 31-year-old Newcastle winger curled a 20-yard shot into the top corner for the Under 21s during their 1-1 draw with Bolton on Monday night.

Gutierrez only returned to Tyneside last month after undergoing chemotherapy in Argentina and has now enjoyed several run-outs for Peter Beardsley’s development side.

And he would have done his claims for a first senior outing since October 2013 no harm at all with a fine goal and energetic display in front of watching caretaker boss John Carver.

Gutierrez said: ‘The most important thing is to get fit and play games.

‘Of course, you always want to win, but for me it’s about trying to get fit and do the best in training and give 100 per cent.

‘It’s always nice waking up in the morning and knowing I have to train – with the chemotherapy and the treatment I wasn’t allowed to do it.

‘I missed it a lot and I enjoy it more than ever.’
