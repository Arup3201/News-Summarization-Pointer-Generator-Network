The tweens on New England's Cumberland American team were left devastated Monday after a close loss in the Little League World Series.

But coach Dave Belisle wasn't about to let his boys feel like losers.

'Heads
 up high, heads up high, I’ve gotta see your eyes, guys,' the coach told his players in a moving speech following the team's 8-7 defeat to Chicago's Jackie Robinson West.

'There’s no 
disappointment in your effort — in the whole tournament, the whole 
season. It’s been an incredible journey,' he continued, in footage captured by ESPN. 'We fought. Look at the score – 8-7, 12-10 in hits.

'We came to the last out. We didn’t quit. That’s us! Boys, that’s us!'

Several of the players sobbed as the coach delivered his speech.

Some had tears in their eyes.

But, Belisle told his team, there was only one reason to feel down.

'The only 
reason why I’ll probably end up shedding a tear is that this is the last
 time I’m going to coach you guys,' Belisle said.

'But I’m going to bring back with me, 
the coaching staff is going to bring back, you guys are going to bring 
back that no one other team can provide — that’s pride. Pride.'

The
 team captivated the attention of their hometown of Cumberland, Rhode 
Island, and were representing New England after winning the regional 
tournament.

Belisle had already stood out with his kind words of encouragement when his players were struggling, CBS Boston reported. On Monday, he took the mound just to congratulate his pitcher on a 'job well done' after he appeared to have given up.

Even
 Stephen Keener, the CEO of Little League international, said Belisle was 
'one of the finest examples of a Little League coach I've ever seen.'

'It’s probably going to take them about 10 minutes, and I’ll go back there and they’ll be in the game room,' Belisle told the Providence Journal afterward.

'I think they’ll get a little bit melancholy when they go back home and
 get off the bus. It’s all going to hit and they’ll say "Wow, we really 
did something special."'

The coach added, 'They definitely learned what the word pride is.'

'I got a lot of attention here for how I coach,' Belisle said. 'It’s
 easy for me to coach like that when you have such wonderful kids that 
dedicate themselves, that respect you as much as I respect them.'

'Heads
 up high. Heads up high. I’ve gotta see your eyes, guys. There’s no 
disappointment in your effort — in the whole tournament, the whole 
season. It’s been an incredible journey.

'We fought. Look at the score – 8-7, 12-10 in hits. We came to the last out. We didn’t quit. That’s us! Boys, that’s us!

'The only 
reason why I’ll probably end up shedding a tear is that this is the last
 time I’m going to coach you guys. But I’m going to bring back with me, 
the coaching staff is going to bring back, you guys are going to bring 
back that no one other team can provide – that’s pride. Pride.

'You’re 
going to take that for the rest of your lives, what you provided for the
 town of Cumberland. You had the whole place jumping, right? You had the
 whole state jumping. You had New England jumping. You had ESPN jumping.
 OK?

'You want 
to know why? They like fighters. They like sportsmen. They like guys who
 don’t quit. They like guys who play the game the right way. If everyone
 would play baseball like the Cumberland Americans, this would be the 
greatest game.

'The 
lessons you guys have learned along the journey, you’re never going to 
forget. We’re going to have some more fun. We have two more days of fun.
 When you walk around this ballpark in the next couple of days, they’re 
going to look at you and say: “Hey, you guys were awesome!"

'Everybody has said: You guys are awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Absolutely awesome.

'It’s OK 
to cry, because we’re not going to play baseball together anymore. But 
we’re going to be friends forever. Friends forever. Our Little League 
careers have ended on the most positive note that could ever be. OK? 
Ever be.

'There’s 
only going to be one team that’s going to walk out of here as World 
Series champions. Only one. We got down to the nitty-gritty. We’re one 
of the best teams in the world. Think about that for a second. In the 
world! Right?

'So, we 
need to go see our parents, because they’re so proud of you. One more 
thing. I want a big hug. I want everyone to come in here for one big 
hug. One big hug, then we’re going to go celebrate. Then we’re going to 
go back home to a big parade.

'I love 
you guys. I’m gonna love you forever. You’ve given me the most precious 
moment in my athletic and coaching career, and I’ve been coaching a long
 time – a looooong time. I’m getting to be an old man. I need memories 
like this, I need kids like this. You’re all my boys. You’re the boys of
 summer.

'So, for the last time, we’re going to yell Americans: One, two three – Americans!”

'OK. Good job. Let’s go. Time to go.'
