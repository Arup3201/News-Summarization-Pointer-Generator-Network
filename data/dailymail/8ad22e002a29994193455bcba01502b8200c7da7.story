More than five children a day are detained at Britain's ports and airports after trying to enter the country, official figures revealed last night.

Nearly 700 were held for up to 24 hours over a four-month period this year.

Worryingly, one in three was not even accompanied by an adult. The figures were uncovered by the Children's Society, which said the numbers were excessive.

But officials said it was sometimes necessary to hold some youngsters while their immigration status is determined and others are being sent home.

Bob Reitemeier, chief executive of the Children's Society, called for the Home Office to investigate why so many children are held.

'We are horrified at the excessive numbers of children being held in the South East and very disappointed that the Government has not kept these numbers to a minimum,' he said.

'It is of great concern that this appears to be happening without sufficient monitoring centrally by the Home Office, including why they are being held, their age and – critically – the length of time that they were held.'

The figures from the UK Border Agency, obtained using the Freedom of Information Act, showed that 697 under-18s were held between May and August.

They cover short-term facilities at the port of Dover and at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports.

The children can be held for up to 24 hours after arriving in the UK. Often they remain in the facility until they can be put on the next flight home.

Almost 700 children were held at UK airports and the Port of Dover in four months this summer

Children arriving at London’s two main airports can be moved to ‘family friendly’ facilities at Tinsley House, an immigration detention centre near Gatwick.

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We have always been clear that we would retain the ability to hold families who have arrived at the border without the right to enter.

‘Where it is considered in the family’s best interests not to stay at the airport until the next flight, we will make arrangements for them to stay at Tinsley House.’

But Mr Reitemeier accused ministers of reneging on a promise to end the detention of children.

He pointed to a report earlier this year which found conditions at Heathrow used to hold children were degrading and ‘wholly unsuitable’.

Part of the Coalition agreement was to end the practice of holding child migrants due to be deported.

Nick Clegg announced the closure of a family wing at Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre responsible for causing ‘significant harm’ to youngsters. Instead, accommodation has been constructed at the Cedars centre in Pease Pottage, West Sussex.

The charity Barnardo’s has agreed to give support to families at Cedars – leading to accusations it is ‘legitimising detention’.
