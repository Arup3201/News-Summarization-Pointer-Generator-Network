A church deacon sued his pastor wife for unfair dismissal after claiming she sacked him when their marriage broke down.

Allan Lavington, 62, has been accused of trying to 'pull a fast one' after he lost a tribunal battle with Pastor Deborah Harrison, who runs a church and Christian-based college centre in Birmingham.

Mr Lavington demanded £1,000 each for music and flower arranging lessons he claimed he gave for her college centre - but the tribunal ruled he was just a volunteer.

Despite the ruling, Mr Lavington said he felt 'robbed' and has vowed to continue legal action against his 58-year-old estranged wife.  

Centre: The church building in Birmingham where Ms Harrison has run a Pentecostal church for four years

Ms Harrison was accused of unfairly dismissing Mr Lavington from her college centre, the Gospel Express Academy in Birmingham, after they split in 2010.

According to one website the centre gives college-level lessons in performing arts, counselling, 'equality and diversity' and 'Christian studies'.

Mr Lavington told an employment tribunal he had not been paid for lessons he gave in music and flower arranging at the centre in Handsworth, northern Birmingham.

But she claimed the former deacon had only been a volunteer.

The employment tribunal ruled in Ms Harrison's favour after agreeing Mr Lavington had insufficient evidence to pursue his claim.

Judge Leslie Antis ruled there was no evidence Mr Lavington was employed by Gospel Express Academy.

Although they are not divorced, the couple from Birmingham split shortly after their own wedding reception, falling out over several issues including a missing titanium cooking pot.

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Lavington - who had also preached at his estranged wife's church - vowed to keep pursuing her through his solicitors.

He said: 'She is erratic and fiery tempered - all I want is to do things to please God and do God's will.

'She has no control over money, no idea about paying bills or anything. She knew I had run my own business and could look after those kind of things.

'Those lessons I gave for her cost £1,000 each. How can she say that I would volunteer to do that and close my own business rather than take a cut?

'I could have done it myself and kept all of it, instead she claims I was willing to do it for just the petrol money.

'I don't preach at the church anymore, I'm a Christian first, I don't bother with titles.

'I'm not bitter, but if I saw her walking down the street, I'd blank her.

'My solicitors will be following this up. I can just now be happy that I can go to God knowing I told the truth.

Accusations: Ms Harrison, who founded her Pentecostal church Ecclesia Ministries and hosts meetings at Birmingham's Ladywood Methodist Church (above), claimed her husband was 'manipulative and controlling'

'How she has the cheek to get up on the altar now, knowing what she has done, is beyond me. I trusted her as a pastor and I was sucked in by that. That is what I'm ashamed of.'  

But Ms Harrison, who founded her Pentecostal church Ecclesia Ministries four years ago, claimed her husband was 'manipulative and controlling'.

She said four months after the wedding she packed her bags and left, unable to put up with his behaviour.

'I'm well out of it,' she said. 'His bombastic attitude vexed choir members. In the end it got very bitter.

'He wanted £74,000 from me - that's £1,200 a month from 2010 to now. He needs to realise that 60 per cent of nothing is nothing.

'He's been pleading "Can I come back?"

'I know he's trying to pull a fast one. He was a volunteer, he was not paid because the academy was a charity and did not pay anyone.'
