A 52-year-old man with a history of domestic violence charges has killed his wife and himself in front of their teenage daughter.

Police said Robert Seeber shot dead 45-year-old Lisa Seeber, his wife of 20 years, with a 12-gauge shotgun in their Ohio home on Saturday afternoon, before turning the gun on himself.

Their terrified daughter, 18-year-old Martina Seeber, said she tried to stop the couple from fighting before her father pulled the trigger.

'My dad and mom were getting in a fight ... I tried
 to stop them,' she told the 911 dispatcher. 'I tried ... he came out and shot her.'

She said her 16-year-old brother was also home. Both children were physically unharmed.

About three weeks before the tragic murder-suicide, Robert Seeber had reportedly completed a court-ordered anger management class from his most recent of three domestic violence charges.

The Seebers stopped divorce proceedings and he moved back into their Long St, Murray City home.

David Valkinburg, chief deputy of the Hocking County sheriffâ€™s office, said Robert Seeber snapped on Saturday after a long period of abusing his wife and Martina Seeber, one of the couple's three teenage children.

'It was a tragic pattern,' Valkinburg said.

Guns: Robert Seeber posted a picture of this gun to his Facebook page, but it is not clear if it belonged to him

Police are investigating what led to the shooting which left the couple, who married in 1994, dead on the living-room couch.

Neighbor Shirley Cook, who had known Lisa Seeber for about 40 years, said her friend was a talented artist and loving mother who gave her husband too many chances.

'She was a wonderful person. I mean, she would give you the shirt off her back,' Cook told NBC4i.com.

'She always kept her heart open, hoping to make things better with him, and make her marriage work.'

In the past: Relatives said Robert Seeber was a war veteran who suffered from PTSD (left), while his daughter Martina Seeber posted an old photo of her and her dad to Facebook reminiscing about 'the good times'

Martina Seeber has not commented on the horrific deaths, but posted a publicly-available picture on Facebook of her, her father and two siblings in happier times.

She captioned the old photo: 'I'll always remember the good times'.

Relative Susann Seeber said that Robert Seeber was a war veteran who suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

'For Rob and all the other veterans that didn't get the help promised them and lost all hope and the fight to carry on,' she wrote on Facebook.

The Columbus Dispatch reported that deputies had been called to the house at least 
three times last year over complaints of violence.

In February 2013, Robert Seeber was accused of hitting Martina after he picked her up from school.

He was convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence in that case and sentenced to 30 days in jail and two years of probation.

He was also ordered to stay away from his daughter and wife, and to surrender any weapons and not get any more.

In August, while the couple was 
separated, Lisa Seeber awoke in the middle of the night to find her 
estranged husband in her bedroom.

Valkinburg said Robert Seeber 
threatened to burn down the house if she didn't leave within two weeks.

A month later, Robert Seeber threatened his daughter Martina Seeber with a pistol.

Court
 records show that, on March 3, Robert Seeber pleaded guilty in Hocking 
County Municipal Court to domestic violence from that last case.

He was 
ordered to spend two days in jail, attend anger-management counseling 
and stay away from Martina Seeber.

NBC4i reported the Hocking County prosecutor said Lisa Seeber had a temporary protection order against her husband, but it was lifted after the last case was resolved and he moved back into the house.
