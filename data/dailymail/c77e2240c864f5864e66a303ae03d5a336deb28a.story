British lawyer Roger Stokes, 49, who died on Sunday morning after being found covered in blood at his flat in Yemen

A lawyer has died in mysterious circumstances at his home in Yemen.

Roger Stokes, formerly of Gosforth in Newcastle, died on Sunday morning after being found injured in his flat.

Mr Stokes, who lived alone in the southern city of Aden, had just moved 
into a flat overlooking the harbour because it 
was 'secure'.

Mr Stokes' sister, Helen Williams, said they do not yet know how the 49-year-old came to be injured.

His death on October 7 is being investigated by local authorities, but it is understood a cause of death has not yet been recorded.

Helen, who grew up with her brother in Heworth, Gateshead, 46 said: 'Roger's driver had gone to collect him from his flat for work on Sunday morning.

'He tried for half-an-hour to raise him and when Roger finally came to the door, he was bleeding badly from his head.Â 

'The driver called an ambulance but, out there, it takes a long time for them to come.

'We understand Roger was unconscious by the time it arrived.

'He was alive when they put him in the ambulance, but died on the way to hospital.'

Family members are unable to fly to Yemen as the Foreign Office in London advise against travel to the troubled country.

Yemen, which is bordered by Saudi Arabia and Oman, was the scene of a revolution last year which led to the long-term president Ali Abdullah Saleh's ousting.

The Foreign Office describes the country as 'volatile' and Helen said the family had feared for her brother's safety as fighting broke out.

When police arrived at her home in Berkshire, Helen initially feared Roger had been attacked.

She said: 'Now it seems as though it was just an awful accident.

'It appears his flat was still secure. It was locked from the inside.'

Roger's aunt June Thompson, of Ponteland, Northumberland, said: 'His employer said there was no indication of foul play, but it is still unclear.

'It is so horrible to think of.'

The former pupil of the King's School in Tynemouth read economics and law at Newcastle University and also had a qualification from Northumbria University.

He worked on Tyneside for a small solicitors' firm and then for Newcastle P&I, before his work took him around the globe.

He moved to Yemen around 15 years ago when Sheikh Tariq Abdullah offered him a job at his company, one of the oldest and most prestigious in Yemen.

Dealing mainly in shipping, oil and commerce, Roger was the only British lawyer in his office.

Helen said: 'He was such a laid-back character, he was almost the ideal person to live in a country which was being ripped apart around him.

'The sheikh has told us that he and all his family are completely devastated.

'Roger wasn't just an employee, he was like a part of their family.'

Roger would try to get home two or three times a year. Annually, he brought over entrants for the English Speaking Union's International Public Speaking Competition.

Roger's family have asked Sheikh Abdullah to arrange for him to be buried in Yemen.

But they plan to arrange a memorial service in the UK and want to get in touch with all Roger's friends and colleagues.
