BBC 1 drama The Ark will not include the iconic scene of animals entering the Ark two-by-two. It stars Shameless actor David Threlfall as Noah

It is one of the strongest biblical images learned in childhood – the animals entering Noah’s Ark two-by-two.

But BBC 1 drama The Ark, to be shown over Easter, will not include the iconic scene – because writer Tony Jordan doesn’t want it to feel ‘like Peppa Pig’.

Jordan, best known for his work on EastEnders, said: ‘What we have done with Noah in the past is to change it into a children’s story. It’s like a version of Peppa Pig.

‘Every time someone makes a film, they have the ramp and then the two crocodiles followed by two ducks. It’s all rubbish.’

The Ark, which stars Shameless actor David Threlfall as Noah, also ignores the scene where a dove carries an olive leaf to Noah to let him know the flood is receding.

But the changes do not please traditionalists. 

Theologian Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali said: ‘The animals are an integral part of the story because it is about the whole of creation, not just human beings. 

'Then the dove coming back with the olive leaf, that is about calmness and the return to order.’

The gritty depiction of Noah may also surprise traditionalists.

In one scene he headbutts a thief and in another his sons talk about the impossibility of making love to their wives in such cramped conditions.

Jordan said his irreverent approach to the original material was about revealing the wider truth in the story, adding: ‘The characters are supposed to be human beings.’

The writer said he chose not to include the scene because he doesn’t want it to feel ‘like Peppa Pig’ (pictured)
