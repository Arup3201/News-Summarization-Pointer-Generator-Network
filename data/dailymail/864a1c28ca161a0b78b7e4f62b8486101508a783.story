'Pervert': James Quigley, 34, an English teacher in Texas, has been charged with sexual assault and maintaining an improper relationship with his 16-year-old student who accused him of threatening her

A high school teacher from Texas has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a 16-year-old female student and presenting her with a contract offering the girl a high grade in return for her silence.

James Quigley, 34, was taken into custody last Thursday after the victim’s parents called police to report that the Richardson High School English teacher had been sending their daughter sexually explicit text messages and emails beginning last March.

The teenager told police that Quigley had threatened her, had sex with her on two occasions and then tried to talk her into signing a written contract stipulating that he would give her a good grade if she kept quiet about their relationship and stayed away from his wife, who also teaches at Richardson High School.

Quigley has been charged with sexual assault and maintaining an improper relationship with a student. He is being held on $100,000 bond at the Dallas County Jail.

According to a probable cause affidavit, the 16-year-old girl’s mother called police last week accusing James Quigley of harassing her daughter with emails and text messages

The mother said that the English teacher repeatedly tried to invite her daughter to go to the movies with him and told her they could be 'friends with benefits.'

When interviewed by police, the teenage girl said that it all started last March when Quigley, who was her English teacher, requested her email address so he could send her information about an essay she had to turn in.

Since then, the underage girl has been allegedly receiving messages from her married teacher telling her she was pretty and had a 'pretty neck.'

Then in May or June of this year, Quigley allegedly showed up outside the girl's house with a 'hot dog for her dog.' The affidavit states that when she went to answer the door, Quigley hugged her, kissed her on the forehead and 'touched her butt.'

The girl told police that she found Quigley parked in front of her house for no reason on multiple occasions, and that one time the 34-year-old educator confided in her that he thought of her while touching himself.

Final straw: The victim told police that she stopped attending Quigley's class at Richardson High School after he left a Starburst candy along with a disturbing message on her desk 

According to the affidavit, one day in class the girl found a Starburst candy on her desk with a note from Quigley that read: 'I would smash you into thin powder, mix you with water and drink it.'

After that incident, the teen stopped attending the teacher’s English class and his tutoring sessions because he would always come up to her and make sexual comments about her neck, according to the affidavit.

At one point, James Quigley allegedly approached the girl with a written contract and told her if she signed the document, he 'would give her an average of 85% or above in his class.'

The agreement prohibited the teen from telling anyone what was happening between them and from 'getting anywhere close' to Quigley's wife, Carla Quigley, who also works at the Dallas-area high school.

The 16-year-old refused to take the deal and left. She then allegedly sent the man several texts asking him to leave her alone.

It was not until the girl's mother contacted police and brought her for an interview with detectives that the teen admitted that between May 1 and June 30, 2014, she and James Quigley twice had sex in her bed.

The girl said that she had kept mum about the encounters because she was 'embarrassed and afraid,' adding that she has since received multiple massages from Quigley threatening her.

James Quigley, who has taught at the school for five years, was placed on administrative leave following his arrest.

According to online records, James Quigley and his wife, Carla, also 34 years old, have been married for six years.
