A nanny has been hailed a hero after saving the life of the four-year-old boy she was caring for from the path of a runaway vehicle.

Cindy Gaston pulled the child from out of the way of the stolen Jeep that crashed into the street corner where the pair were standing in Greenwich Village, New York.

Despite her heroics, however, the 25-year-old has refused to take any credit and has thanked God for her chance to have save the boy's life.

Amazing escape: The stolen Jeep took out a traffic light after the heroics of Cindy Gaston

'I didn't have time to think about being a hero, it was more of an instinct so I'm really blessed that I even have the chance to be called a hero - I really thank God for that.

Injured: The car clipped her leg as she dived to save the little boy

'I was still shaken up by it...but it was instinct. I really didn't have time to think: 'Let me save this child, let's run away so we can save our lives,' she told New York Daily News.

The nanny, who suffered bruises from the accident and remains on crutches, said the pair were waiting for the boy's four-year-old sister last Thursday when she spotted the vehicle heading straight towards them on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 13th Street.

Although the Brooklyn-born nanny only had seconds to react to the immediate danger, she managed to hoist little Jonathan Meltzer to safety.

The stolen Jeep clipped her on the back of the leg before it came to a halt.

Dezmon Sardina, the 19-year-old driver, was arrested by police on suspicion of stealing the vehicle from his girlfriend.

He was also charged with reckless endangerment having been apprehended in a nearby cemetery after fleeing the scene.

The mother of the rescued four-year-old said she had much to thank her nanny for.

'She totally saved my child's life,' Chandra Meltzer, told New York Daily News.

The brave 25-year-old carer said the decision to play a guessing game with the child which meant she had been keeping her eyes on the road saved the pair's lives.
