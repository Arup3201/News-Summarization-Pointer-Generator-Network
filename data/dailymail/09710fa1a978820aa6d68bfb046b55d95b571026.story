Muslim fundamentalists are plotting to take over state schools, according to leaked documents.

Activists have launched a campaign to oust headteachers using dirty tricks such as spreading false allegations and packing governing bodies with their supporters.

The plot, which ringleaders have named Operation Trojan Horse, has emerged in documents drawn up by the group and leaked to a local newspaper.

The dossier names several schools in the Birmingham area as targets of alleged plots.

The authors of the documents discuss extending the ‘jihad’ operation to Bradford and Manchester – cities with rapidly growing Muslim populations.

Investigation: There have been allegations of faked resignation letters at Adderley Primary School in Birmingham, possibly connected to a reported Trojan Horse operation by Islamic fundamentalists

Last night Birmingham City Council 
said it had launched an urgent probe to establish the authenticity of 
the documents, which are understood to name up to 12 schools.

The
 investigation is being monitored by police and the Department for 
Education, which said it would not hesitate to take ‘firm action’ 
against those involved.

The
 Mail understands Education Secretary Michael Gove met the leader of 
Birmingham City Council last month to discuss the documents.

Apparently
 written by fundamentalist Salafist Muslims, the papers outline a 
five-point guide to forcing out a headteacher and installing supporters 
in key positions to ensure a school is run according to Islamic 
principles.

This involves identifying state schools in Muslim areas which are underperforming and at risk of being turned into academies.

Under the academies programme, schools are removed from local council oversight.

Assemblies were allegedly carried out in Park View School promoting radical Muslim clerics with links to terrorism and extremist views

One
 passage reads: ‘We have caused a great amount of organised disruption 
in Birmingham and as a result we now have our own academies and are on 
our way to getting rid of more headteachers and taking over their 
schools.

‘Whilst 
sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way to do things
 you must remember this is a “jihad” and as such all means possible to 
win the war is acceptable.’

One
 head, who is understood to have resigned following a plot to oust him, 
said last night his decision to quit had been ‘vindicated’.

Balwant
 Bains, former headmaster of Saltley School, said he was unable to 
comment directly on the claims but confirmed he had been forced to leave
 his job.

But he said 
last night: ‘It was a difficult situation. I had to leave. It’s a tough 
time. I am trying to move away from a very horrible, horrible 
experience, and I am pleased that it has been exposed.’

Another
 headteacher targeted by the extremist group is understood to have been 
the victim of unfounded allegations that she was encouraging pupils to 
cheat in their SATs exams.

Linked: Saltley school was also named in the documents

The
 documents are understood to refer to the group having ‘planted the 
seed’ of the allegations in order to undermine headmistress Tina 
Ireland.

The 
allegations against Miss Ireland resulted in her pupils’ SATs results 
being cancelled. Soon afterwards she resigned from her job at Regents 
Park Primary.

At a 
third named school, Adderley Primary, police have launched a fraud 
investigation into claims from four staff members that supposed employee
 resignation letters had been faked.

A
 fourth school, Park View Academy, which is headed by Lindsey Clark, was
 given a snap Ofsted inspection this week after claims were raised of 
unfair treatment of non-Muslim staff.

That
 school said in a statement last night: ‘Although we are not aware of 
any such campaign actually being carried out in relation to Park View, 
we are of course concerned about the school potentially being targeted 
for such action.

‘We remain on alert for any such conduct, and will act appropriately.’

The Trojan Horse documents have been leaked to media outlets including the Birmingham Mail.

Similar documents have since been sent to several head teachers.

The council investigation involves several departments, including legal, audit, human resources and education.

A
 spokesman said: ‘We have received letters making allegations in 
relation to some schools in the Birmingham area. Birmingham City Council
 is continuing to investigate these allegations and therefore cannot 
comment further.’

Lindsey Clark, Park View's executive head, reportedly said faith classes were being organised, but for after-school lessons

West Midlands Police is being kept updated on the inquiry.

Chief
 Superintendent, Alex Murray, commander of East Birmingham police, said:
 ‘In December 2013 Birmingham City Council brought the content of a 
letter they were investigating to the attention of West Midlands Counter
 Terrorism Unit requesting we make an assessment of whether any criminal
 offences had been committed.

‘The
 assessment at that time and remains the case today is that the 
allegations in the letter were for further investigation by Birmingham 
City Council and the Department for Education and were not a matter for 
the police.

‘The city 
council has continued to keep us updated on their enquiry in the event 
that any findings either warrant police investigation or impact on our 
joint delivery of Prevent (anti-extremism strategy) across the city.’

A
 Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the serious 
allegations made in relation to some local authority schools and an 
academy in Birmingham, and are in close contact with a number of 
parties, including the police, the council and teaching unions.

‘Birmingham City Council is investigating all these allegations and we are also looking specifically at the Park View Academy.

‘All schools are subject to a tough inspection framework and must meet the high standards and requirements rightly expected.

‘We
 will not hesitate to take firm action if these are not being met – in 
particular where we become aware of issues of concern in an academy we 
will move quickly to resolve these.’

The Trojan Horse documents appear to be correspondence between a Birmingham-based Muslim fundamentalist and an acquaintance in Bradford.

They outline a five-point guide for taking over a school and encourage expanding the operation to Bradford and then Manchester.

The recipient is first urged to identify any Salafi parents – Muslim fundamentalists – sending pupils to the school.

‘They are always the most committed to the faith and are hardliners in that regard and once charged up they keep going for longer,’ the documents say.

‘When the parents have been identified, we start to turn them against the headteacher and leadership team.

‘The only way to do this is to tell each parent that the school is corrupting their children with sex education, teaching about homosexuals, making their children pray Christian prayers and mixed swimming and sport.

‘If you can get them to be very vocal in the playground as they drop off or pick up their children that will stir up other parents.

‘The parents MUST be given direction and told not to discuss this with anyone, you only need a maximum of four parents to disrupt the whole school, to send in complaints to question their child’s education and to contact their MP and local authority.’

Plot: It was claimed that fundamentalists 'planted the seed' that the head of Regents Park Primary, pictured, had encouraged pupils to cheat in exams

Further steps are to ‘parachute in’ 
Muslim governors to ‘drip-feed our ideal for a Muslim school’ and 
galvanise staff to urge the council to investigate the school.

The document stresses the importance of having ‘an English face among the staff group to make it more believable’.

Anonymous letters should then be circulated to MPs, press and ministers.

The
 documents state: ‘All these things will work toward wearing the head 
down, removing their resolve and weakening their mindset so they 
eventually give up.’

The
 documents state: ‘Operation Trojan Horse has been very carefully 
thought through and is tried and tested within Birmingham, implementing 
it in Bradford will not be difficult for you.’

The
 operation, the papers say, has been fine-tuned so that it is ‘totally 
invisible to the naked eye and allows us to operate under the radar’.

They
 go on: ‘I have detailed the plan we have in Birmingham and how well it 
has worked and you will see how easy the whole process is to get the 
headteacher out and our own person in.’

State
 schools with poor Ofsted reports and with large Muslim pupil 
populations should be targeted for takeover, the writer says: ‘The poor 
performing schools are easy to disrupt, the better performing with 
strong head teachers are much harder and so we have to manufacture a 
strong enough reason, but rest assured we have not failed yet, no matter
 how difficult removing the head teacher may be.

‘You just have to be clever and find the most appropriate way to deal with the school.’

The
 documents add: ‘This is all about causing the maximum amount of 
organised chaos and we have fine-tuned this as part of operation Trojan 
Horse. You must identify what the heads’ strengths are and build a case 
of disruption around that.’

Salafi
 Islam is a strong fundamentalist version of the faith that seeks to rid
 itself of modern-day ‘impurities’. Followers believe in strict 
adherence to the Koran.

They
 argue worshippers have lost touch with the true nature of the religion 
and want to revert to the ancient form of Islam. Salafi comes from the 
root word ‘ancestors’.
