A transgender woman who works as an engineer at Twitter has been charged with raping her wife after they had filed for divorce.

Dana McCallum works as a senior Twitter engineer and is now facing five felony charges stemming from an incident that occurred the night after she served her wife of six years with divorce papers.

McCallum, whose legal name on the charging documents is Dana Contreras, was arrested on January 26 and charged with three counts of spousal rape, one count of false imprisonment and one count of domestic violence.

Accused: Dana McCallum has been charged with three counts of felony spousal rape by her wife after an alleged incident that occurred the night after McCallum served her with divorce papers

McCallum has been listed as one of the top ten most important LGBT people in tech and she has spoken at length about her transition after being born biologically male.

She and her wife, who has not been named due to the nature of the crime, had been married for more than six years.

The San Francisco Examiner reports that the 32-year-old engineer and her wife were separated but were still having sexual relations by the time of the alleged crime.

McCallum had served her wife with divorce papers on January 25 but they met up at some point that evening.

At 2am on January 26, police responded to a sex assault call at a residence in the Mission district of San Francisco.

McCallum's wife accused her of rape, but McCallum has denied any wrongdoing.

Outspoken: McCallum, pictured, has openly written about how she was born a biological man and has transitioned to living as a woman

According to the San Francisco police, the state of California classifies rape as penial on vaginal assault. They were not able to reveal any of the specific details about the suspect or the victim, but said that in order for a rape to have occurred, it would have to meet the aforementioned criteria.

Denial: McCallum's lawyer said that there was no rape and that the case has only become an issue since McCallum is due to make a windfall when Twitter goes public

McCallum has written extensively about her lengthy transition to living as a woman, and while she has alluded to having procedures in the past but never specified if she had female genitalia surgically created.

'It takes forever. You don’t just go to 
the doctor and get a “sex change operation” (that’s not even a real 
thing) and then three days later you walk outside and have a brand new 
life. No. My transition took nearly a year. And there’s a long period 
during that time where you’re sort of in-between, not clearly male or 
female,' she wrote in a personal essay shared on her website.

Other common procedures can include breast augmentation, laser hair removal and Adam's apple and facial feminization as well as hormone therapy.

McCallum's lawyer said 'this whole thing 
is about money' because McCallum 'is about to come into a large amount 
of money' because she is a senior engineer at the social media company 
which went public in November.

Lawyer John Funfola, told The Examiner that there were four teenagers in the house at the time of the alleged assault but they did not claim to have heard any struggle.

'No one heard ‘rape’ or fighting or anything,' Runfola said.

'I’m just disgusted that, you know, this is going on.'

Famous face: McCallum, whose legal last name is Contreras, has been ranked one of the top ten most important LGBT individuals in the tech industry and works as a senior engineer at Twitter

McCallum posted a message on her widely-followed Twitter account on Friday afternoon, saying: ‘Can’t comment until the case is wrapped up. Bye for now <3’

She is known to be an outspoken advocate for equal rights and has published an essay version of the talk she gave last year to an LGBTQ (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Questioning) group at her old high school in Indiana.

In the moving and detailed talk, she discussed the emotional and physical process of transitioning.

'My transition took nearly a year. And there’s a long period during that time where you’re sort of in-between, not clearly male or female,' she wrote.
