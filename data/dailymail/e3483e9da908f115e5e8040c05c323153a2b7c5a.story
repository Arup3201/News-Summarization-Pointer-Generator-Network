Nigel Pearson believes Esteban Cambiasso can be the key for Leicester to return to winning ways.

The City manager reckons his Argentine midfielder has the knowledge to help the Foxes to victory at Swansea on Saturday.

They go to the Liberty Stadium in the Barclays Premier League after one point from their last three games.

Cambiasso won the Champions League and five Serie A titles before arriving on a free transfer from Inter Milan over the summer.

And Pearson knows the 34-year-old can play a crucial part for the Foxes.

'He's settled in well and it's been a very positive impact,' he said. 'Experience is difficult to quantify over the course of the season but he has an unbelievable amount and I'm sure that will play a very important role over the season.

'Whether he plays or is on the bench it is fair to say he has an important impact on the group.

'Without going into the selection situation for the weekend it's good to have a squad which is available.'

Pearson's opposite number Garry Monk was contacted by the Football Association this week to 'seek his observations' following comments he made about Victor Moses and referee Michael Oliver in the 2-1 defeat to Stoke on Saturday.

They are yet to decide whether to take disciplinary action against Monk after he accused Moses of cheating to win a penalty.

He also alleged Oliver made a 'disgusting decision' in awarding the spot-kick.

But Pearson would not be drawn on the subject, ahead of facing Monk in south Wales.

'I wouldn't dream of advising other managers, it's not my position to do that,' he said. 'It's an emotional game and we have all be in that situation before.

'I wouldn't think that Garry would want my advice on anything. He is the manager of Swansea and deserves the right to manage there. He will manage in his own style. How people deal with situations is up to them.'
