Actress Liz Dawn, best known as Coronation Street's Vera Duckworth, has suffered a heart attack.

TV legend Liz, 73, was taken to hospital after complaining of mild chest pain at her Manchester home.

She already suffers from incurable lung disease which has left her in a wheelchair.

Coronation Street stars past and present have rallied round the popular actress, who left the soap in 2007 after being diagnosed with emphysema, sending messages of support to the soap's 'tough old bird'.

Recuperating: Liz dawn, pictured on This Morning on February 11 this year, was rushed to hospital after having a heart attack

Husband Donald, who is the screen legend's main carer, told The Sun: 'Liz is in hospital. She's had a slight heart attack.'

He added: 'She's all right'.

The star was rushed to hospital on Monday night after falling ill at her apartment in Whitefield, Greater Manchester.

Friends said she has since been allowed home to recuperate.

Britain's best loved couple: Vera, played by Liz, and Jack Duckworth, played by Bill Tarmey, were a soap institution - Liz said she was devastated after Bill death last November

Former co-star Sally Lindsay, a close friend of the actress, has spoken out to wish her close friend a speedy recovery.

According to The Sun she told the star: 'Stick in there girl, you're as tough as old boots.'

Sally, who played barmaid Shelley Unwin from 2001 to 2006, said Liz is the 'funniest person... we all love her.'

Liz, who smoked 24 cigarettes a day, was in the soap for 34 years before leaving due to health problems.

Grief: Liza said she missed her 'best friend' Bill more and more since he died (pictured here at his funeral in last November)

Millions watched as her character died in her sleep in 2007 but she briefly made a return in 2010 as Vera's 'spirit' when her screen husband Jack Duckworth, played by Bill Tarmey, left the soap.

Liz was left grief-stricken after Bill died last November and said she 'missed him terribly.'

Speaking on This Morning in February she said: 'He were my best friend, we never had a row.

They made us laugh and cry: Liz's character Vera, left the soap in 2007, Bill was to leave in 2010 - he died two years later

'He were fabulous, I am missing him more the longer he is gone. Wonderful man.'

Liz, who was hospitalised briefly this year due to health problems, said her mission for 2013 was to 'stay alive'.

She said: 'I've only made one plan for 2013 - to make sure I am alive this time next year. If not for the doctors, I wouldn't be here today. But my health is very bad.'

Her real-life love: Liz with her husband Donald who she said does everything for her

She revealed in the interview that only a third of her lungs work, adding: 'Thank god I have ten years of it. I wished I never smoked.

'My husband Donald does everything with me. I am reliant on him for everything.'

MailOnline has contacted Liz's spokesman for a comment.
