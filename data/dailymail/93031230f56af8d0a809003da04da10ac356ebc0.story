Drug-users' excrement is making dogs in Berlin high.

Vets in the German capital have warned of a rise in the number of dogs that are unable to walk properly after eating faeces in a number of the city's parks.

Tests have shown that the dogs have accidentally ingested drugs as hard as heroin and have been poisoned as a result.

The canines have fallen ill in parks in the Kreuzburg and Treptow areas of Berlin, which attract drug users, who occasionally go to the toilet in bushes, according to the Tagesspiegel newspaper.

Treptower Park is vast and a tourist attraction alongside the river Spree in the district of Treptow-Köpenick, south of central Berlin.

It is predominately known for its huge Soviet War Memorial built to the design of the architect Yakov Belopolsky to commemorate the 50,000 Soviet soldiers who fell in the Battle in Berlin in May 1945, but it also contains an abandoned amusement park.

Treptower Park is well known for its huge Soviet war memorial, but is now attracting media attention for its drugs problem

Vets said the excrement in such parks 
is proving dangerous to dogs, which have come into surgeries shaking and
unable to walk properly.

Local vet Reinhold Sassnau told German English news site, The Local, that the dogs also displayed symptoms of dehydration and a rapid heartbeat, caused by the drugs.

While fatal cases are rare, dogs that are not taken to the vet quickly can have to stay in a clinic for some time while they stabilise.

Dogs taken to the vet's immediately receive an emetic, which forces them to vomit up what they have eaten, in order to get the drugs out of their system.

A student told the newspaper that he had to take his 10-year-old dog Bob to a vet after taking him for a walk through Görlitzer Park, which is a well known spot for drug taking.

He said: 'We thought he was going to die.'

Vet Jörn Bischof, who treated Bob in October said that similar cases of dogs that have got sick by accidentally ingesting drugs, are becoming more frequent.

While dogs do tend to eat waste that they come across in parks, he suggested that owners try and train them not to, to avoid the increasing problem.
