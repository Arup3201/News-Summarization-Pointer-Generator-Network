New drug: Kadcyla can extend life by more than six months, but has been turned down by Nice

Women are to be denied a revolutionary new drug for breast cancer on the NHS – the eighth such treatment to be turned down in three years.

The rationing watchdog will confirm today that it will block routine use of the drug – which can extend life by more than six months – for those with the most aggressive form of the disease.

Experts reacted with dismay to the decision, which means that eight consecutive therapies for advanced breast cancer have now been turned down since 2011 because of the cost.

Kadcyla is the first medicine designed to attack cancer cells while dramatically reducing side-effects such as hair loss.

The treatment costs almost £6,000 a month, totalling £90,000 for 15 months treatment, which the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) insists is too expensive.

The NHS was offered a discount scheme by manufacturers Roche, but Nice wanted the price cut by 60 per cent.

Roche said yesterday it would appeal the decision, which it said showed the system was ‘not fit for purpose’ and would put British breast cancer treatment behind that of other countries in Europe.

Dr Jayson Dallas from the firm said: ‘Despite Roche offering a significant discount we are once again disappointed that Nice has not shown any flexibility on access to Kadcyla, a drug with qualities that Nice chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon described on live television as “impressive”.’

He said more than 15 years of research and development had gone into Kadcyla, backed by 30 years’ work on the underpinning technology.

NICE’s decision to block the routine use of Kadcyla has been condemned by Paul Ellis, professor of cancer medicine at King’s College, London.

He led trials for the drug in the UK which were funded by drug manufacturer Roche.

Professor Ellis said the drug’s special mode of action – which seeks out and destroys cancerous cells while sparing healthy tissue from unnecessary damage – made it a ‘truly revolutionary drug’.

He added that Nice’s rejection was ‘a real blow’ to women with advanced breast cancer.

Professor Ellis said: ‘For the first time in 20 years as a consultant I’m seeing people with advanced disease taking an effective drug with little toxicity. The two don’t usually go together.

‘Kadcyla tackles the disease in a different way to any other breast cancer medicine and provides women with valuable extra time with their families and loved ones – time that you cannot put a price on.

‘Kadcyla is able to deliver significantly increased efficacy to patients without the toxic side-effects associated with potent chemotherapy drugs – ultimately meaning that patients can live for longer with a better quality of life. This is achieved through the innovative way that Kadcyla works. Because its action is so precise, a normally toxic form of chemotherapy can be used but healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage.

‘It represents a significant step forward in the fight against a particularly aggressive and notoriously difficult-to-treat form of the disease. Nice’s decision not to fund the drug for routine NHS use serves as a real blow for all those involved.

‘While patients in England can access the drug via the Cancer Drugs Fund, we need to work towards a solution to ensure long-term access to this truly revolutionary drug.’ 

‘Refusing patients access to this drug is an incredible injustice and tantamount to turning the clock back in cancer research and development. We plan to appeal this decision,’ Dr Dallas added.

Kadcyla – also called T-DM1 –combines the original ‘wonder’ drug Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy agent which acts only when it reaches cancer cells.

It attaches to tumour cells and blocks signals that encourage the cancer to grow and spread. It then breaches the outer defences of the cell and releases a payload of chemotherapy to destroy it from within.

Because its action is so precise, healthy tissue is spared from unnecessary damage.

At the same time the cancer is delayed from returning and side-effects from chemotherapy such as diarrhoea and hair loss are significantly reduced.

Trial results show it provides six months’ extra life on average, but some women having once-monthly infusions are living far longer.

Up to 1,500 women a year in Britain with HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread could benefit.

The decision by Nice means the drug will not be transferred to the NHS budget. Patients in England can still apply to get it from the Cancer Drugs Fund set up to fund medicines not routinely available on the NHS.

But the CDF does not work elsewhere in the UK, and is due to be wound up in 2016.

Dr Emma Pennery, clinical director of charity Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘Kadcyla being rejected from routine NHS access will come as another devastating blow to women with HER2 positive advanced breast cancer, denying them the chance of a longer and much better quality of life.

‘Nice, the Department of Health and the pharmaceutical industry must work together to identify a new way forward that takes into account both human and economic impact.’

Nice chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon said: ‘Although Roche proposed a discount, it made little difference to its value for money, leaving it well above the top of our specially extended range of cost effectiveness for cancer drugs.

‘We are really disappointed that Roche were not able to demonstrate more flexibility to help us make a positive recommendation. The company is well aware that we could not have recommend Kadcyla at the price it proposed.’

Hayley Kalinins has been granted precious extra time with her four children thanks to Kadcyla.

Mrs Kalinins, 33, was told she had advanced breast cancer in July 2011, after months of being misdiagnosed. By this time the cancer had spread to her liver and she was told she had just eight months to live.

At first she was given two courses of chemotherapy, but she said the brutal treatment ‘stripped her out’. She lost her hair and suffered many side-effects.

She was moved on to different chemotherapy but again suffered severe side-effects, developing cracks in her feet that prevented her from walking.

Mrs Kalinins, who lives in Derby with husband Andrew and her children aged 13 to three years, then heard about Kadcyla and insisted on a second opinion at a Sheffield cancer centre.

It was approved through the Cancer Drugs Fund in February. She is on her sixth cycle of the drug and the tumours on her liver and lungs are now stable.

She said: ‘I’ve had minimal side-effects. We’ve had a really nice summer with the kids and been to Disneyland Florida. I couldn’t have done that on the other drugs.

‘I don’t know how long I’ve got, it’s incurable but I feel well and every month is a bonus.’

She said she is devastated by the Nice decision to deny women like her the chance to have the drug. ‘These decisions seem to be made without emotion, but that’s what’s important,’ she added.
