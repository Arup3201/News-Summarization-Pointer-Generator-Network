The English regions will be given extra powers as a domino effect if Scotland votes to remain in the UK, Nick Clegg said yesterday.

The move would also affect Wales and Northern Ireland and would result in a ‘much needed rewiring’ of how the UK is governed.

Mr Clegg described England as an ‘unusually over-centralised country’ and said the changes that would occur in the next parliament were the ‘missing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle’.

Under questioning from MPs, the Deputy Prime Minister insisted the sudden announcement of a timetable for significant Scottish devolution – dubbed ‘Devo Max’ – was not a panicked move.

Devolution in Scotland was an irreversible process and would have knock-on effects for the rest of the UK, particularly the English regions, which would be given greater powers over tax and spending.

‘I think it will signal a much wider rewiring of the governance and constitutional arrangements in the country as a whole, particularly governance within England which remains an unusually over-centralised country,’ Mr Clegg told the Commons political and constitutional reform select committee. When Scotland is granted further powers over taxation, welfare and borrowing ‘that will signal a wider debate about how we can rewire and decentralise the British state… that’s the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle’, he said.

Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats joined together in Edinburgh yesterday to promise more devolution in the event of a No vote. But there was continued confusion as to what powers would be devolved, as the three parties have each separately published differing proposals.

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the parties’ devolution proposals have ‘broad themes’ in common and that voting No would allow the parties to mould them into a single offering.

But Alex Salmond said it showed the No campaign had ‘fallen apart at the seams’. The First Minister said: ‘We now know after all of the hype of the last 48 hours they realised that the ground was shifting under their feet. But actually, nothing is new in this package. It’s nothing approaching the powers that Scotland needs to create jobs, to save the health service and build a better society.’

Andrew George, Lib Dem MP for West Cornwall, made an early plea yesterday for his county to be ‘next in line’ for devolved powers.

Mr Clegg admitted the Devo Max announcement this week was about ‘timetable and process’ not the substance of the powers – saying doing so would violate referendum campaign rules. He defended the Government against claims it blundered by not offering a Devo Max option on the ballot paper.

‘When you have a referendum it’s very important you have clarity and certainty about what the choice is. That’s why you only devolve powers after a decision has been made by the Scottish people that Scotland will be part of the United Kingdom.’

Scots get home rule, England pays bill  

The Scots have been promised an array of new powers if they vote to stay in the UK. JAMES SLACK examines the likely consequences.

What extra tax-raising powers will the Scots get?

While the final details are still being hammered out, the prominent role taken by Gordon Brown suggests Labour’s blueprint will be at the forefront. This would allow MSPs to vary Westminster’s income tax rate by up to 15p in the pound, giving them the option of raising the higher rate threshold, and restoring the punitive 50p rate for top earners. There would be no new powers over corporation tax, national insurance, VAT or capital gains tax. The Tories say the tax-free personal income tax allowance should remain reserved to Westminster. Under Lib Dem proposals the Scots would raise and spend most of their own taxes and borrow on their own terms.

How will the money be collected?

As now, all income tax will be paid into the UK treasury before being passed on to Scotland in the form of a grant. In future, if Holyrood decides to increase – or decrease – taxes on Scots the HMRC will adjust their bills accordingly and pass the appropriate sum on to Scotland.

Will Scotland’s benefits regime be more generous?

Yes, if that’s how Holyrood chooses to spend the money. Under Labour’s plan, control of housing benefit – which costs £1.7billion in Scotland – would be devolved, so it’s expected the so-called bedroom tax would immediately be axed, at a cost of £50million. Attendance Allowance, paid to disabled or infirm OAPs, will also be devolved. It’s feared that, armed with the new tax powers, the Left-wing SNP would hammer middle and higher earners with tax rises.

Can Scots expect a better-funded NHS?

SNP leader Alex Salmond has been peddling the myth that Scots should vote Yes to protect the NHS: in fact, it is already run entirely by the devolved administration. However, should Scots wish to devote more money to fund the Health Service, they would be free to do so using their new tax-raising powers.

Who will pick up the lion’s share of Scotland’s benefits bill?

The UK as a whole would remain on the hook for the most expensive, big ticket welfare spending. This includes the state pension, Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment Support Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, maternity pay, and bereavement benefits.

Will the Scots continue to get a better deal than the English?

Labour says it would keep the controversial Barnett formula, with only minor adjustments. Currently, it gives Scots £1,364 per head more spending than the UK average. While no party has spelled it out, it appears certain that Scotland would continue to be free to spend more overall than it receives in taxes.

Aren’t Scots already getting extra powers?

Yes. The Scotland Act 2012 – intended to spike Mr Salmond’s guns, ahead of the referendum – guarantees the largest transfer of financial powers in 300 years. This includes a new Scottish rate of income tax – which may be varied by 10p in the pound. Income tax can already be varied 3p, but this power has never been used.
