A mother who videoed herself punishing her adopted son by squirting hot sauce into his mouth and giving him a cold shower has avoided jail.

Jessica Beagley, 36, of Alaska, was convicted of child abuse after carrying out the brutal punishment on her seven-year-old adopted Russian son.

She used an eight-minute video of herself punishing the boy for lying as a ploy to get on the ‘Dr. Phil’ television show, prosecutors said.

Beagley avoided jail but was sentenced to three years of probation, a 180-day suspended jail term and a $2,500 suspended fine.

She submitted the eight-minute tape for a show segment titled ‘Mommy Confessions’ and said the boy lied about getting into trouble at school.

After squirting hot sauce in the young boy's mouth for lying, she also punished him with a cold shower.

Beagley wasn't trying to get help for him through the show and had set up counselling sessions previously, Cynthia Franklin, prosecuting, said.

The punishment of the child on tape was a gratuitous act aimed at getting herself on television, Ms Franklin told the court.

‘Jessica Beagley did not have to make this video and did not have to do this to her son,’ she said.

With her husband, an Anchorage police officer, at her side, Beagley said it was her most important job to love and nurture her children.

She said being a good mother meant teaching children right from wrong.

‘I would ask that the court would allow me to be that mother that I would like to be, to not disrupt the lives of my children any more than has been already,’ she said.

Noting the seriousness, District Court Judge David Wallace rejected a request by Beagley's lawyer for a suspended imposition of sentence.

This could have allowed Beagley to have her conviction erased. But Judge Wallace said: ‘It was a premeditated, gratuitous act.’

Beagley had faced a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $10,000 fine. She adopted the boy and his twin brother with her husband in 2008.

The boys were five years old at the time and had spent three years in an orphanage.

Before that, their family had lived in a shack and the twins slept on shelves in an armoire.

One twin adjusted to his new home in Alaska, but the other exhibited behavioural problems that included lying and urinating on the floor.

Beagley's lawyer said his client turned to unusual forms of punishment when spankings, time-outs and restricting television did not work.

Beagley had asked the ‘Dr. Phil’ show for help, William Ingaldson, defending, said.

The incident sparking the videoed punishment happened last October.

The boy got in trouble at school for sword-fighting with pencils and lying about it, his mother said.

Confession: The show's host, Phil McGraw, told Beagley her actions to punish her adopted Russian child were 'outrageous'

During the trial, Ms Franklin told the jury it wasn't Beagley's first attempt to get on the 'Dr Phil' show.

After seeing a segment in April 2009 titled ‘Angry Moms,’ she contacted the show but heard nothing for a year and a half, Ms Franklin said.

Jessica Beagley, 36, was convicted of misdemeanor child abuse at a court in Anchorage, Alaska. 

She was sentenced by District Court Judge David Wallace to:

The show eventually called to find out if Beagley was still angry, Ms Franklin added.

Beagley submitted audition videos in which she yelled at the boy, but producers wanted to see her actually punishing her son, prosecutors said.

That's when Beagley got the video camera ready and made sure there was enough hot sauce on the shelf in the bathroom.

Then she recruited her ten-year-old daughter to shoot the video, Mr Franklin said.

Days later, Beagley was headed to Los Angeles, California, to tape the show that first aired last November.

The episode sparked public outrage in Russia, with some demanding the boy and his twin brother be returned to their native country.
