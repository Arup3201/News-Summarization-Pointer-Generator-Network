Leicester boss Nigel Pearson insists the start of the managerial merry-go-round has not put him under any more pressure.

Newcastle visit the King Power Stadium in the FA Cup on Saturday with Magpies assistant John Carver at the helm with Alan Pardew poised for a return to Crystal Palace.

The sacking of Neil Warnock at Selhurst Park was followed almost immediately by the dismissal of Alan Irvine at West Brom and Pearson would appear to be the one now most under threat with his side bottom of the Premier League and four points from safety.

A cup game is probably the last thing he wants having taken an important four points from their last two matches but knows his future will not be decided on whether Leicester are successful in the knock-out competition.

And the fact Newcastle are currently in a state of flux will not affect his planning for the game.

'I probably won't change my approach at all,' he said.

'Unfortunately before Christmas there were none and now there are three of four (managerial) changes.

'Football has been blighted with too many changes - this season has been slightly different, but one goes and it seems to be a signal for changes.

'I can't spend too much time analysing how that works out as I am sure John Carver will be preparing his home town side very well.

'All I can do is focus on our own situation. I will always do the job I feel is correct for us but it is inevitable as a manager you will lose your job.

'What I know about our owners is we have a very good personal and working relationship and their decision will always be based on what is right for the club.

'I am in no position to argue any different to any other manager. They will do what is right.

'Clearly our priority is the Premier League.'

Pearson will make a number of changes for the cup match as he tries to lessen the effect of four matches over the festive period.

While a win against Newcastle would provide an important confidence-booster the Foxes boss believes his side have already shown they can compete against established Premier League clubs.

'It is fair to say we have made a number of changes through this period of games but there is no right or wrong way to do it,' he said.

'To play against Newcastle at home gives us the chance to build on some decent results but it is inevitable there will be changes.

'But throughout the season I don't think you've heard me talk about disappointing performances.

'It is never easy to sell the idea to people that the belief and commitment is there and we think we are good enough.

'It is about results and we had a testing second half to 2014 and we have to see what we can do for the remainder of the season.

'As a side coming up it is never easy to compete at the same level against established Premier League clubs but all the sides who were promoted last season have shown ability over the last few weeks to get results.

'We have to try to build on that. We are still not in a great position but we have to build on the positives we have had and not concentrate on what people are saying.

'It is important to stay in touch but at the same time we have to make up ground.'
