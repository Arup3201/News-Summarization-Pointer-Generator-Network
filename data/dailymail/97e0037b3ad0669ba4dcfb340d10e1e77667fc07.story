Bill: Danny Alexander warned Scots could face a tax hit of more than £1,000 a year if they vote for independence

Scots face an income tax bombshell of more than a £1000 a year if they break away from the United Kingdom, the Treasury has warned.

The stark message of the true cost of separation was set out by Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, in a letter to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond.

He warned that Scotland would have to find an extra £3 billion a year to plug the black hole in its finances if it became independent.

It would amount to an eight percentage point rise in income tax for basic rate payers, taking their average tax bill up from £2,517 to £3,523 - an extra £20 a week.

Only if Scotland came up with economic growth that was unseen in Europe for half a century could it avoid the tax rise.

The damning finding deals a blow to the Scottish Government’s attempts to convince Scots of the case for independence as it prepares to publish its 600 page white paper making the case for independence today.

But ahead of its publication, former Chancellor Alistair Darling, chairman of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said: ‘If they ignore the cost of independence or claim that a vote by Scotland can force other countries into doing what Alex Salmond wants, it will be a work of fiction.’

Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published a report warning the basic rate of income tax in Scotland would have to rise from 20p to 28p or make massive public spending cuts.

Scotland’s ageing population and the predicted drop in oil revenues could leave it facing spending cuts or tax rises of 1.9 per cent of its national income.

A further analysis of the IFS figures will be issued by the Treasury today.

In a letter to the Scottish First Minister, Mr Alexander said: ‘One week ago the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) projected that under independence Scottish public sector net debt could rise above 100 per cent of national income by the early 2030s and above 200 per cent of national income over 50 years.

‘This is not a sustainable position.  Even under the most optimistic scenario the IFS considered, in 2021-22 an independent Scotland could have to find permanent tax increases or spending cuts that would be equivalent to £3 billion in today’s terms. Treasury officials had calculated that 
this would mean ‘an average increase for basic rate tax payers in 
Scotland of around £1000 per year’.

An independent Scotland would also have to grow by around 4.2 per cent a year for the next half century to reduce its debt to the same share of national income as the UK. It is a growth rate that no European country has managed for the last 50 years, Mr Alexander said.

In response to Mr Alexander’s letter, a spokesman for SNP Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘This rushed and panicky letter from Danny Alexander shows just how rattled the No campaign are by the launch of the White Paper and its positive vision for Scotland’s future.

‘The reality is the policies of his Tory-led Government have cost many ordinary Scots far more than £1,000 each since they came to office.’

Last night Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael issued a rallying call for non-Scots to make their voices heard in the independence debate.

‘I am eager to hear from people in Wales, Northern Ireland, Liverpool and Newcastle as well. It should not just be Scots saying they want to remain in the UK,’ he told the Mail.

‘There are more families than ever in Scotland that have family in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These people do not want borders and barriers to be put up.’

Education Secretary Michael Gove said he would remain a politician at Westminster if Scotland voted to go independent.

But he added: 'One of the things I'd find very difficult is accepting that the country which I grew up in, which defines my identity, was no longer part of the Union.

'It would be... a remarkable development when the identity with which we grew up had been shredded,' he told ITV's The Agenda.
