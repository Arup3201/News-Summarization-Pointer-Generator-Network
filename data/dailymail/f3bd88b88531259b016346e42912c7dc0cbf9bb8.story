On the Strictly dancefloor it was a night for celebration as the judges awarded a string of tens for stunning performances.

But as the dancers returned backstage, the smiles of jubilation turned to tears.

Thieves had ransacked a dressing room used by the female stars and professional dancers as they performed, and then fled unnoticed via a network of underground tunnels.

The changing room, shared by Strictly's celebrity and professional dancers, was ransacked on Saturday

Chaos: Dancers prepare for their performance in one of the dressing rooms at Blackpool Tower

It is believed the gang targeted the women's dressing room at The Blackpool Tower while Strictly Come Dancing was being filmed and then escaped through a network of underground tunnels

Police are investigating the theft in which iPads, iPhones, cash and jewellery were all stolen

Jewellery, an iPad and mobile phone – 
containing the stars’ personal messages, pictures and telephone numbers –
are all understood to have been taken from the changing room used by 
Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Abbey Clancy and Natalie Gumede.

Saturday night’s broadcast moved from Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire to the Blackpool Tower Ballroom for one night.

The
raid was carried out as the programme reached its finale and all the 
dancers were in the famous ballroom about 100 yards away.

It
is believed the thefts are the work of insiders who knew how to 
navigate the maze-like backstage interior of the venue and knew the 
perfect time to strike.

It 
is claimed the gang will have avoided being picked up by security 
scanners and the CCTV cameras in Blackpool Tower by using a network of 
underground tunnels to make their escape.

The theft was reported after the show but it is thought they may have targeted the changing room during the live performance. Pictured Abbey Clancy and Natalie Gumede after their dances

Yesterday,
a show insider said: ‘It’s such a shame as it really spoilt the end of 
an amazing night. There were security scanners on doors and entrances 
where the audience came in plus on every backstage entrance but with a 
1,000-strong audience, 90-plus dancers and all of the production crew 
there were tonnes of people on set and so much going on.’

The
audience was made up of members of the public chosen by ballot, local 
dignitaries and family and friends of the competitors – none of whom 
would have had behind-the-scenes access passes.

The Tower is owned by Blackpool Council and managed for the authority by entertainment giant, Merlin.

Merlin and the BBC were responsible for security in the build-up to the live show and during the broadcast itself.

Meanwhile,
former Bond girl Fiona Fullerton became the latest celebrity to leave 
the show last night after ending up in the dance-off with actor Mark 
Benton.
