Sudanese mother Meriam Ibrahim who escaped the death penalty for marrying a Christian today said she will start a new life in the U.S. 'like a real family' and 'trust in God as I always have done'.

In her first comments since arriving in Italy after her ordeal at the hands of the barbaric Sudanese authorities, Meriam said: 'Thanks to God we are all fine. I trusted God from the first instant. I knew that he would not abandon me.'

It also emerged today that Meriam only learned that she would leave Sudan just two hours before she boarded the plane to Rome after months of behind-the-scenes diplomatic wrangling.

death row for refusing to become a Muslim

When Meriam, a trained doctor, landed with her husband, Daniel Wani and their two children yesterday they were given an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican. He blessed Meriam and her baby daughter, Maya, who she gave birth to on a prison floor two months ago.

Talking to Antonella Napoli, a campaigner for Italians for Darfur, Meriam said going to the Vatican was 'like a dream'. She said it was 'the peak in the faith which I have never abandoned.'

She added: 'Even when they condemned me to death I never thought of renouncing my religion. When I was asked to renounce my religion I knew what I was risking. But I didn't want to do it.'

Meriam, 27, said she now hopes to start a new life in the U.S. 'like a real family' in the next few days, where her husband is a U.S. citizen and lives with his brother, Gabriel, in Manchester, New Hampshire.

Daniel had been in Sudan since her arrest in a bid to free his family and it cost him his job as a biochemist.

Meriam had been held in a notorious women's prison, shackled and with their 21-month-old son, Martin. The toddler was not allowed to live with his Christian father because the authorities considered him a Muslim.

She said: 'I will put my trust in God as I always have done. We will start a new life. My husband is a chemist but he lost his job because of my story. Now we will go and live in New Hampshire. We will all be together like a real family.'

But she said she will never be able to return to Sudan, where she once owned a business. 'I will never go back,' she said. 'My family wouldn't let me.'

The case drew worldwide attention in May when she was sentenced to death over charges of apostasy. A daughter of a Muslim father, Meriam was raised by her Christian mother.

The Sudanese woman was sentenced to death in Sudan for refusing to recant her Christian faith

She married Daniel in a church ceremony in 2011. As in many Muslim nations, Muslim women in Sudan are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, though Muslim men can marry outside their faith. By law, children must follow their father's religion.

Sudan's penal code forbids Muslims from converting to other religions, a crime punishable by death.

The court in the capital, Khartoum, had also ordered Meriam be given 100 lashes for having sexual relations with her husband.

When she asserted that she was in fact Christian she was then accused of apostasy.

She was freed after months of international pressure but was initially prevented from leaving the country. In one dramatic incident she was detained at Khartoum airport by up to 40 of the Sudanese security forces.

Her brother, who is believed to have brought the original case against her, publicly vowed to execute her if he had the chance. It is understood he then tried to bring a petition to make her stay in the country.

Since June 26 she has been staying at the American embassy in Khartoum, where officials from Italy, the U.S. and the UK tried to secure her release.

The family's escape finally came on Thursday morning when they were flown on a private jet to Rome accompanied by Italy’s Deputy Foreign Minister Lapo Pistell.

Meriam's lawyer, Shareif Ali Shareif told MailOnline today: 'Meriam only learned she was to be rescued two hours before she left Sudan. She did not know where she was going. She was not told before.'

Mr Ali 
Shareif said the Italian government had attempted to help the persecuted
 mother-of-two to flee Sudan when she was first released from jail in 
June. But their efforts were thwarted by hardliners within the Sudanese 
authorities who refused to let her go.

Mr Ali Shareif said: 'It was a political initiative between the Italian and the Sudanese governments.

'When
 Meriam was released from jail they tried to get her out of the country 
then. But the rescue attempt was not successful so the negotiations with
 the Sudanese authorities continued.

'Meriam only learned about this when she got on to the plane. She was not involved in the negotiations at all.

'She was very happy to be finally leaving Sudan. It has been very difficult for Meriam and her family.

'We didn't dare believe it was actually going to happen until the plane took off. Then we were celebrating.'

The Vatican said Pope Francis had 'a very affectionate' meeting with Meriam her husband and their two small children.

Vatican
 spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said: 'The Pope thanked Meriam and
 her family for their courageous witness and constancy of faith. For her
 part, Meriam expressed gratitude to the Pope for the great support and 
comfort she received from his prayers and from so many others believers 
of good will.'

Speaking to the MailOnline, Mr Wani's brother Gabriel said: ‘It’s 
beautiful news. All the hard work has paid off. I want to thank everyone
who helped to free her.

‘It’s just wonderful. I don’t
have to worry any more. It’s over.'

Lutz 
Oette, counsel for UK-based campaign group Redress, which fought for Dr 
Ibrahim’s release, said: ‘We very much welcome the news. But it’s an 
indictment of Sudan’s criminal law that Meriam Ibrahim had to face 
prosecution for being who she is.

‘She, 
and others like her, have been forced to leave the country for being 
different, dealing a further blow to Sudan’s traditions of tolerance and
 diversity . It is now time for Sudan to see to it that Meriam and her 
family receive justice for all their suffering’.
