In any discussion about spiralling transfer fees, it is always the richest clubs that get the blame. Manchester City, or Chelsea, are typically held responsible for the fact that clubs in the lower leagues are crippled by an expensively hostile market.

Yet the most inflationary transfer this summer, without a doubt, is Ross McCormack’s move from Leeds United to Fulham for £11million.

Big deal: McCormack moved from Leeds United to Fulham for a hugely inflated £11million

Relative: Suarez at £75million is a snip compared to Fabio Borini to Sunderland for £14million

The proposed sale of Fabio Borini to Sunderland from Liverpool for £14m is not far behind.

These are the deals that will be 
quoted when Leicester City open negotiations for Troy Deeney at Watford,
 not the £75m paid by Barcelona for Luis Suarez.

Relative
 to the Borini deal, Suarez is a snip.

McCormack’s move, meanwhile, 
jacks up prices in domestic football, forcing clubs abroad for value as 
opportunities for British players decrease. And so it goes.
