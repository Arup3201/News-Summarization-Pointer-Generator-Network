For many first-time parents, all they want is for their child to be happy and healthy.

Jade and Ross Morley were no exception when they welcomed their beautiful baby boy, Floyd-Henry, into the world in 2013.

At five months old, the Morley's were given the news that Floyd-Henry had an extremely rare genetic condition called achondroplasia, commonly referred to as dwarfism.

Jade and Ross Morley welcomed their beautiful baby boy, Floyd-Henry, into the world in 2013

'My mum actually knew something was wrong when he was born,' Jade told 60 Minutes.

'She held him just after he was born and she said, 'It's ok mate, we'll look after you',' she said.

The Morleys, from Casuarina on the north coast of NSW, took little Floyd-Henry at five months old to see a specialist and received news that devastated them- Floyd-Heney had achondroplasia, a condition which affects 1 in 25,000 births.

The doctor asked Jade if she had heard of the condition, and she said that she broke down crying at the question. 

'I had [heard of it], I’d googled it. Short arms, short legs, and a big head,' Jade said.

'Out comes straight away is achondroplasia. But then the word that’s the hardest to hear is dwarfism,' she said.

The couple said the news devastated them, and made them question their relationship. 

'You hold your breath and try and work it out in your head,' Ross told 60 Minutes.

'It made us question our own relationship. It’s so rare, it just happened and there was nothing we could have done,' Ross said.

'It made us ask whether we were meant to be together,' he said.

'It really threw us, especially at that time of our life when everything is meant to be so perfect.' 

Ross and Jade said that they were afraid for what the condition would mean for Floyd-Henry.

'[We were afraid] that he was going to get picked on, or bullied, and that people wouldn’t accept him, that they would be ignorant and not understand,' Jade said.

'At the start I just wanted to hide him. I remember taking him to the shopping center and wanting to get a photo with Santa,' she explained.

'But then I said 'I cant do it, because they’ll see his little legs and head and wonder why',' she said.

'I wanted to be proud, but I was scared of what other people would think.'

The Morley's found it difficult to explain to their friends and family the condition that Floyd-Henry had, and to show that they were still very much in love with their child.

When Jade broke the news to one of her friends, she was saddened by the reaction and decided that she couldn't tell everyone in person. 

'Initially it was a selfish thing,' Jade said.

'I thought it's too hard, we can't do it, we can't tell everyone,' she said.

The Morley's decided to create a video that explained that Floyd-Henry had achondroplasia, in a way that was uplifting and explained exactly how much they loved him.

They posted the video to Facebook, which explained how Jade and Ross met, fell in love, married, and had a 'beautiful baby boy'.

The video explains that Floyd-Henry was diagnosed with the condition, which means he will be 'a shorty- a little man, a little legend'.

Jade said in the video that the condition 'has possible complications and we will tackle these as a family as they arise.'

'At the start I just wanted to hide him. I remember taking him to the shopping center and wanting to get a photo with Santa,' Jade explained

'If you have any questions about Floyd-Henry, please ask us and remember that we are learning too,' Jade said.

The inspirational video has been shared and liked all over the world, and the Morley's said that they have been overwhelmed by the support they have received.

'Everyone just had such beautiful things to say about him, and our family, and how it would be great,' Jade said. 

'We are happy to have a unique little boy who is alive and well...We can't wait to see our little man grow and progress,' said Ross.

'Just remember he’s just small that’s all,' he said.

'We are not sad because we have him with us today,' said Jade.

The Morley's said that they are so grateful for the support they have received from their community, and the love that their friends and family have shown them. 

With Jade expecting twins in the middle of next year, the couple are excited to see what the future holds for Floyd-Henry and are excited to see him continue to exceed their expectations.
