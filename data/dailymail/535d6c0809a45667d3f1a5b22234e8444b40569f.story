Stoke City striker Bojan Krkic is clearly relishing his first Christmas in England having posted a picture of him hugging a tree.

The 24-year-old evidently loves the festive season, uploading the shot of him onto Instagram with the caption 'Getting ready for the most wonderful time of the year #Christmas tree'. 

Bojan, a former Barcelona youth prodigy, has been slow to show his true qualities in England since signing this summer with just two goals for Mark Hughes' side but has improved in recent weeks having scored in the 3-2 win over Arsenal last weekend.

Bojan hit Stoke's second as the Potters comprehensively beat Arsenal to move up to 13th in the Premier League, in what was by far his best display in a red and white shirt. 

Hughes will hope the 24-year-old can continue to link up well with Peter Crouch at the top of Stoke's attacks ahead of the busy festive period in the Premier League.

Stoke still contest four more games in December, kicking off at Crystal Palace this Saturday, before a New Year's Day home clash with Manchester United at the Britannia.
