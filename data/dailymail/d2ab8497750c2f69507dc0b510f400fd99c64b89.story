Alleged bomb plot: Oregon teenager, Grant Acord, pictured, is accused of meticulously plotting to blow up his school in an attack 'forged and inspired by' the Columbine shootings

A high school student who was arrested after plotting to blow up his school reportedly talked to friends about bomb-making a week before his capture.

Grant Acord, 17, was arrested on Thursday night after police received a tip that he was making a bomb to blow up West Albany High School after being inspired by the Columbine High School shooting 14 years ago. 

On Saturday, investigators found six explosives hidden under floorboards at his mother's house. The weapons included pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails, a Drano bomb, a napalm bomb and explosives made from drain cleaner.

Now his friends have spoken out about how they should have been more suspicious when Acord started talking to them about the materials that one needs to build a bomb.

'He was just, just kind of randomly came up to us and started talking about the different materials that you need to make a bomb,' Thomas Stone told local ABC affiliate KATU.

'You know, I didn't think much of it 'cause he's kind of a strange kid, so I wasn't surprised he had some strange hobbies, you know?'

Another friend said that the relaxed way in which the issue came up didn't tip them off to the fact that they should think of it as a sign of a darker plan of action. 

'It wasn't like '"Oh, I'm making bombs, I'm gonna blow stuff up,"' classmate Keegan Boggs told KATU.

'It was just talking about it, like something that you wouldn't really think like "Oh, he's gonna blow something up. Like a school."'

Target: Police say Acord planned an attack on West Albany High School modeled after the deadly 1999 Columbine school shooting

He also had 'plans checklists, diagrams, inspirations, sources and a focus on recreating the model of Columbine, with adjustments that would make it more successful,' according to Benton County District Attorney John Haroldson.

The 1999 massacre in Littleton, Colorado,
which was carried out by two Columbine High School seniors, Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, left 13 dead and 21 others wounded.

'This was a very methodical process,' Haroldson said. 'He took time to even get to this point.'

Police have not yet pinpointed a motive for Acord's plot.

Attorney Mr Haroldson said he wasn't aware that the teen was having trouble at school, or being bullied. He was described as quiet and a loner by other students, though one student said he seemed like 'a pretty nice guy.'

Secret compartment: The student at West Albany High School allegedly hid at least six bombs and bomb-making material in a secret compartment under the floor of his bedroom

'In
any case that you have a young person that in essence plans to take a 
video game approach to killing people at school, you have to take a 
close look at the mental health issues,' he said.

'And the process will 
certainly provide for that once he's represented by counsel.'

The teen will be arraigned Tuesday as an
adult on one count of aggravated attempted murder and six counts each 
of manufacturing a destructive device, possession of a destructive 
device and possession of a weapon with intent to use it against another 
person.

According to KPTV - FOX 12, police accompanied by K-9 dogs found no 
bombs during two searches of West Albany High, which is about 75 miles 
south of Portland.

Acord was taken into custody just before
10.30pm Thursday at his mother's home in the 2400 block of Northwest 
Violet Street in West Albany after police discovered six explosives 
hidden under the floorboards.

Officers who searched the premises for evidence also uncovered a detailed plan, checklists, a diagram of Acord's school and a timetable for when he allegedly planned to carry out a mass murder using bombs and gunfire, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported.

'This is beyond a kid playing with a 
couple of cherry bombs. It was serious enough to warrant calling out the
bomb squad,' Albany police Capt. Eric Carter told KATU-TV in Portland.

Students at West Albany High School are shocked after hearing of the foiled bomb plot.

'I'm just shocked because you hear about it at other schools and other places around the world, but you never really think it's going to happen,' high school junior Keagan Boggs told KPTV.com.

Senior Dennis Reilly said: 'I'd say "hi" to him in the hallway because I was kind of like I should probably talk to this kid, make sure he feels OK. So, I talked to him sometimes, and he seems like a pretty nice guy.'
