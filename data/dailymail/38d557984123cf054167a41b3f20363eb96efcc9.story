As the worst drought in 32 years threatens to cause a food crisis across Central America, people living in Nicaragua have been advised to consider farming and eating iguanas.

Low rainfall in an unusually hot season has led to a series of droughts in parts of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, damaging crops and pushing up food prices.

Now, a government expert in Nicaragua has recommended keeping and eating iguanas as a way of providing food, as well as an income.

Land management expert Guillermo Membreño told state-run online newspaper La Voz del Sandinismo, as translated by The Guardian: 'Breeding iguanas brings two benefits. Not only does it supply dietary protein, it also offers a commercial use for the animals.'

He said the tropical lizards contained 24 per cent more protein than chicken and could also be sold for their meat, skin or as pets.

While hunting iguanas is outlawed by the country's environmental laws from January to the end of April, they are allowed to be kept as food.

Iguana meat has been described as similar to chicken, but sweeter, and is most often used in stews, tacos and roasts. 

The suggestions made by the government expert however have reportedly been mocked by some Nicaraguans.

The advice comes after bean and maize crops have been destroyed by the poor rainfall and hot weather,  linked to the El Nino weather phenomenon.

In a recent report, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, run by the U.S. Agency for International Development, said: 'Extremely poor households across large areas of Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador will experience a rapid deterioration in their food security in early 2015.

'Atypically high levels of humanitarian assistance, possibly the highest since Hurricane Mitch in 1998, will likely be required in order to avoid a food crisis.'

According to the Thomson Reuters Foundation, thousands of families are no longer able to buy enough food to survive.

In Guatemala, the government has said it is to provide 170,000 families with food from early October, while the Honduras government is already distributing foods including rice, beans and flour, along with vitamin supplements, to more than 75,000 families.

The Worldwatch Institute's Nourishing The Planet programme has said iguanas are already used for meat in Puerto Rico, after their population exploded since their introduction in 1970.

Elsewhere, Mexico and El Salvador exports iguana meat, with nearly 10,000kg exported to the U.S. between 2001 and 2008. 

According to the blog post, the lizard's eggs, which are also edible, have a cheesy flavour.
