Jessica Watson, the Queensland woman who in 2010 became the youngest person to sail solo and unassisted around the world, has defended herself against critics of her weight and argued that too much emphasis is put on the physical appearance of young girls.

Writing in a blog post, the 21-year-old spoke of the attention placed on her physical appearance by teenagers to whom she gives motivational talks at high schools.

'A group of girls gathered around me to ask questions. But a comment from one girl shocked me, "Wow, you're so skinny",' she wrote in a guest post for Free Spirit Girl.

'I was a little disappointed that this was the only thing that the girl had taken away from my visit. She seemed more interested in the way I looked, rather than what I had to say.'

In the post, Ms Watson said body image was something she never thought about while growing up because she was completely focused on her goal of sailing around the world.

'Body image had nothing to do with boats, navigation or weather systems, so it didn't enter my head! I was blissfully ignorant to the pressure placed on young girls and the way they should supposedly look,' she wrote.

But since she has started talking to groups of high school students about her achievements, the world-record-holder says she has realised just how strong the pressure is that is placed on young women to look a certain way.

Ms Watson cited her family's attitudes as part of the reason she remained oblivious to societal pressures about appearance for so long.

'I've always been surrounded by family and people who placed far more value on what you thought, than the way you look,' she wrote.

In the motivational post, Ms Watson encouraged girls to see fitness as part of 'feeling your best both mentally and physically' and to 'chase your dreamsâ€¦ It's incredible what we can achieve if we set our minds to it!'
