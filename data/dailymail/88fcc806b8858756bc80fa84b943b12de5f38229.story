Trevor Smith, 42, known as Trevor Hancock, who appeared in Coronation Street and Emmerdale, was found drowned in a disused quarry in Derbyshire 

A former Coronation Street actor who struggled with his career and sexuality killed himself just hours after learning that his father had died, an inquest has heard.

Trevor Smith, known by his stage name Trevor Hancock, was found drowned in a lagoon at a disused quarry near his home in Derbyshire on January 6 this year.

One day earlier, the 42-year-old had been discharged from a week-long stay in hospital, after undergoing surgery for self-inflicted injuries.

As he was being discharged, a nurse at the hospital also gave him the devastating news about his father's death.

Just one hour later, a concerned friend had reported Mr Smith missing, a call which triggered a day-long manhunt for the actor. 

Officers found his mobile in his home, which contained pictures of the quarry where his body was discovered the following day.

It later emerged that Mr Smith, who had also appeared in Emmerdale and Hollyoaks, had been overwhelmed by his career, stress and his sexuality in the months before his death and suffered from 'dark moods'.

Mr Smith, who was born in Middleton, Greater Manchester, had been admitted to Sheffield's Northern General Hospital on December 30 after his friend phoned 999 over concerns for his welfare.

The inquest heard how he had sent a text to a young student actor whom he 'had taken under his wing' saying: 'Sorry I have to go now. You're the only one who can do this.'

The message to Tom Lewin also asked him to phone police, as well as the people he wanted to contact about his death.

After Mr Lewin phoned the emergency services for help, police smashed down Mr Smith's door and found him unconscious in the bathroom. When they revived him, Mr Smith told officers he did not want to be saved.

In hospital, the actor underwent surgery for his injury, before both of wrists were put in casts.

He was also assessed by psychiatrists, who were happy for him to leave hospital, under the proviso he was monitored by the community mental health team.

But later that morning, Mr Smith told his close friend Darren Langford, with whom he was staying, that he needed to take a  jacket back to a friend. When he did not return for an hour, Mr Langford called the police.

Mr Smith, who had been a professional actor since 1991, appeared in Coronation Street (pictured) in 1999 as Kevin Dolan, a valuer from estate agents Adam Wade & C, who were selling the soap's shop, The Kabin

The inquest heard that, while in hospital, Mr Smith had disclosed 'problems with his career, stress and his sexuality'. 

The actor had been a professional actor since 1991, training at Manchester's Arden School of Theatre from 1996 to 1999.

That year, he went on to appear in Coronation Street as Kevin Dolan, a valuer from estate agents Adam Wade & C, who were selling the soap's shop, The Kabin.

He later appeared in two episodes of Emmerdale playing a character called Tom. He also took on roles in Hollyoaks, ITV's The Memoirs of Sherlock Homes, and Channel 4 medical drama No Angels.

Along with a number of short film credits, including Gate Crash, Behind Closed Doors he appeared in a feature film Salvage and various TV commercials.

But his career had stalled in recent years and his sister Julie Smith said he had been depressed about his life.

'He loved acting and had small roles on TV and in the theatre,' she said in a statement. 'He believed he would become a great actor.'

She said he had mentioned suicide in the past, but to her knowledge had never harmed himself.

During the hearing in Chesterfield, Derbyshire's assistant coroner James Newman read a statement from Katherine Wells, a mental health nurse at the hospital, who had told Mr Smith his father had died. 

Summing up Mr Newman said: 'Whilst in hospital it would appear that Trevor Smith, to some extent, disclosed the reason why he had cut his wrists, it was, mainly related to his career, stress and his sexuality.' 

Returning a conclusion of suicide the coroner said: 'I'm satisfied with the evidence before me that Trevor Smith intended to take his own life, but furthermore he took steps to carry that out.' 

After his death, Coronation Street stars led the tributes to the late actor.

Antony Cotton tweeted: 'Love life and live life because you just never know…With great sadness, @Ecclestonshire and I have just raised a glass to our friend and colleague who died today. Rest in peace my friend.'

While Kym Marsh said: 'Very sad news today. Still in shock. A huge loss for us all RIP to an amazing guy #so young.'

Samia Ghadie also posted a quote which read: 'Be grateful for every second of every day that you get to spend with the people you love. Life is so precious.'

Catherine Tyldesley, who plays Eva, retweeted her co-star's posts and also shared: 'Just awful. A true gentleman. So thoughtful, kind and gentle. RIP. Gods new angel [sic].'
