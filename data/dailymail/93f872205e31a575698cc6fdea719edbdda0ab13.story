He has been the spitting image of Kim Jong Il for more than decade - with his bouffant hairdo, large glasses and olive green suit.

And while he got plenty of abuse in the street from the misguided few who really thought he was the North Korean dictator, South Korean Kim Young Sik was never short of work as his double.

But now it looks like the good times are over and southern Kim will have to hang up his wide-waisted trousers for good following the death of northern Kim.

'People try to comfort me, saying some 
figures are more famous when they're dead, but I don't think it will be 
the case with Kim,' said the engraver.

But he added wistfully: 'I feel very empty, as if a part of me died.'

Sik, 61, said he never dreamt of becoming a part-time communist ruler and fell into the role by accident.

He said: 'One day after I got out of the shower and my hair was very curly, people told me I looked like Kim Jong Il.'

When then-South Korean president Kim Dae-Jung began the Sunshine Policy of reconciliation with the North in the late 1990s he started to be noticed and was invited to appear on television.

Since then he has enjoyed an 
illustrious career appearing on Japanese TV, in a Middle East chocolate 
commercial, and in 1995 South Korean film The Rose of Sharon Blooms 
Again.

North Korea's military has pledged 
to keep up its aggressive stance towards the west under the country's 
new leader, Kim Jong Un.

Top generals from the secretive 
state said today they would refuse to work with South Korea's president 
Lee Myung-bak, whom they described as a 'traitor'.

The belligerent message came after 
Kim Jong Un was declared 'Great Leader' for the first time following the
 death of his father Kim Jong Il last week.

North Korea's powerful National 
Defence Commission said the country would never deal with Mr Lee, a 
conservative who stopped a no-strings-attached aid policy toward the 
North in 2008, and that it was 'uniting around Great Leader comrade Kim 
Jong Un'.

The movie was about a South Korean 
scientist who secretly helped the North develop nuclear weapons to 
prevent a Japanese invasion.

It led to him rubbing shoulders with celebrities and world leaders - or at least people who look like them - including George W Bush and Vladimir Putin impersonators.

But the highs of portraying a man who presided over a deadly famine and tested a nuclear bomb have not been without the lows, and he regularly receives abuse walking down the street.

He said: 'Some people curse at me and call me 'dictator', but those who know me wave and shout 'Kim Jong-Il!'. Then I would wave back at them and show them some of Kim's moves.'

It is also tough work keeping up Kim's appearance.

He perms his hair every three months and before his death closely followed changes in his look and demeanour.

He even went on a diet when the late leader lost weight following a 2008 stroke.

He added: 'Back when Kim Jong-Il was 
young, I used to use hairspray, but after he got old and started to lose
 hair, I didn't have to do anything.'

He has four different suits made in the style of the late ruler along with five pairs of platform shoes.

He added: 'Before, I used to wear the 
outfits almost everyday, but now I just wear them once in a while and 
when I'm invited to be Kim Jong Il at an event. It's a shame I won't be 
able to wear them anymore.'

Since Kim Jong-Il died on December 17, he fears his career is almost over. He also regrets never having met his inspiration or even visiting North Korea.

He added: 'Kim was a great man in a way because although he was a dictator, he built a country like no other. Do you think anyone could do it?'

Now, as Kim's youngest son Kim Jong Un inherits the world's last communist dynasty, the late leader's double thinks it is time to step aside for a new generation.

He said: 'I'd like to do more acting as Kim Jong Il, but they'll find someone new for Jong Un. They asked if my son looked like him but he doesn't or I would have sent him to an audition.'

Eagle-eyed observers of how North Korea's media covered Kim Jong Il's funeral believe they have been up to their old tricks - with a spot of Photoshopping.

A seemingly doctored photograph has emerged of a soldier, who appears to be well over 8ft tall, in the back row of one block of mourners.

The image was captured as the funeral procession passed near the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in the capital Pyongyang.

Standing out: But then, on closer inspection, he can clearly be seen towering above his colleagues

Official news agency KCNA took the photo, and the giant soldier appears to show him from several different angles.

Some believe it could be 7ft 8in tall North Korean basketball star Ri Myung Hun.

It follows yesterday's emergence of evidence showing how the scores of wailing mourners were not the only well-choreographed aspect at the memorial service.

Two comparison photos (below) showed how a camera crew filming the sombre ceremony were apparently erased from history after being digitally removed from the picture.
