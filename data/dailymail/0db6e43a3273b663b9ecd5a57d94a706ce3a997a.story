Clothes shopping must be so easy if you’re a size 10 former model with jutting hip bones and legs up to your armpits. But for the rest of us, the twice-yearly search for a fresh look can be a living hell.

Now, however, costume designer and stylist David Zyla, who dresses actors, celebrities and prominent figures including Hillary Clinton, has pooled his vast knowledge to provide an insider’s guide to effective — and enjoyable — shopping.

‘No one is born knowing how to shop,’ he says. ‘It’s a skill that needs to be developed.’

GLAM UP BEFORE YOU GO OUT

Style your hair and put on your favourite lipstick because you'll be spending a lot of time in front of a mirror (picture posed by model)

Your goal is to find fabulous things that make you look and feel great. Everything you purchase should showcase you at your very best.

So when you hit the shops, dress smartly (in clothes you can speedily whip on and off to minimise time in the changing room), style your hair and put on your favourite lipstick, because you’re going to be spending a lot of time in front of a mirror.

Check your wardrobe first to ensure you are focused on what you want and need. Even if you think you’ve got nothing to wear, your current collection holds the secret of past shopping triumphs.

Pick out your favourites — the dress that gets compliments, the skinny jeans that prompt friends to ask if you’ve lost weight — then work out why they work so well. Is it the neckline? The cut? The colour? These are the cues against which you can compare all potential new items.

Next, pull out anything you rarely (or never) wear. Try it on and be honest as to why it doesn’t get worn.

Perhaps the colour isn’t quite right, it doesn’t go with anything you own, you don’t have the right occasion, it makes you look chubby/busty/flat-chested/big-bottomed, or you are convinced it will be perfect when you lose half a stone.

Let this be your lesson not to buy anything that doesn’t fit your body perfectly right now. Buying in anticipation of future weight loss rarely works.

BARGAINS WILL BE ON THE LEFT

Don’t be duped! Be on your guard for tempting displays as you enter a store.

Most people are right-handed, and studies show people tend to gravitate to the right-hand side of the shop first, which is where the newest (and the most expensive) merchandise will be placed.

Carpeted areas can be danger zones, too; stores use carpeting to slow you down in the sections where they want you to spend the most time (and money).

And don’t be seduced by ‘anchoring’, a sales practice in which two similar items with very different price tags are placed next to each other so that the more expensive item makes you think the cheaper one is a bargain.

Scan the shop for colour first, then go in for a closer look at style, size, fabric and price. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by long racks of clothing. Colour is the easiest starting point.

STICK TO COLOURS THAT FLATTER YOU

Remember to choose colours that suit your skin tone and make you look your best (picture posed by model)

The right colour for you is a shade that makes your skin look more radiant — avoid anything that makes you think it might work with different or better make-up.

Stick with the colours that flatter you and keep your personal colour palette in the forefront of your mind.

Avoid neutrals: the woman in merlot, turquoise or cerise is the one you’ll remember, so if an item is available in both a neutral and a colour, go for colour — your colour — and make an impression.

Store lighting can distort colour, so ask the sales assistant if you can take an item to a window, and only make a decision to buy if it looks great in natural light.

STRETCH OUT IN THE FITTING ROOM

If you like it, sit down in it. Something may look great when you’re standing up straight, but you’re likely to be spending a lot of time sitting, so always check how it feels when you’re seated.

When trying on a buttoned shirt, stretch your arms back so that your chest sticks out. If there’s any sign of gape, don’t buy it.

When trying on trousers, do these fitting-room gymnastics: bend at the knees and at the waist, then sit and squat. If you can’t do any of this comfortably, you’re in the wrong pair.

BUY BIG TO LOOK SLIMMER

Don't be afraid to go up a size if the outfit is more flattering that way, no one will check what the label says! (picture posed by model)

Go up a size to appear slimmer and don’t fret about what the label says. No one will check when you’re wearing the item and looking amazing.

The important issues are: does it flatter? And, is it good quality?

When buying a bra, try it on using the loosest, not the middle, hook. Bras stretch out over time so if it fits at the loosest setting, you can tighten it over time to maintain the right fit.

Only shop for shoes in the afternoon. Feet swell during the day, so buying when your feet are at their largest makes you less likely to end up with shoes that pinch.

CHOOSE CLASSIC DESIGNS

When budgeting for a seasonal wardrobe, aim to spend 75 per cent on classic items and 25 per cent on trends. By sticking to mostly classics, you will get much more use out of any high‑fashion items.

If you come across something you absolutely love that’s eye-wateringly expensive, only consider it if it’s something you can wear for years to come.

Save your money by buying trendy pieces at lower-priced stores to ensure you feel no remorse next season when fashion moves forward.

WALK AWAY IF YOU'RE NOT SURE

The best way to avoid an impulse buy is to take the time to really think about a purchase if you're not totally sure, take 24-hours to consider your choice (picture posed by model)

You may love a design you saw on a red carpet or in a magazine, but unless you love it on you, don’t buy it. Be true to yourself. Trust your instinct — if you find yourself questioning the purchase, it’s for a reason.

The litmus test for something daring is to pick a fictional character it would work on (Marge Simpson? The Good Wife?). If that reflects you, buy it; if not, pass and move on.

The best way to avoid an impulse buy is not to buy. If you’re unsure, walk away and give yourself a 24-hour cooling-off period.

Ask the shop assistant to put it on hold, and if you then can’t stop thinking about that item, run back the following day and get it. But if you remain undecided, you’re better off without it.

Before you hand over your credit card, check the store’s returns policy. You may only have seven days, or the store may have an ‘exchange only’ policy which could affect your decision.

If you’ve got the item home but you’re still not sure, hold on to the receipt. Then set an alarm on your phone for one day prior to the last return date — if you still haven’t worn it, take it back for a refund.

Never worry about coming home empty-handed from a shopping trip. A day spent fruitlessly shopping can be frustrating, but accept there are good shopping days and bad shopping days and that your success rate will vary.

SHOP ONLINE ON TUESDAYS

Stores will put new items on sale on Tuesdays and will also put some items into the sale section, bear this in mind when browsing the web for clothes (picture posed by model)

Do your online shopping on Tuesdays, as this is the day stores put up sale and new items.

Colours can be tricky to assess online, so try to view two different items in the same fabric to discern the true shade.

When unsure about a fabric, use the zoom feature to reveal texture and possible sheen.

Don’t buy a garment you haven’t seen on a model. A flat picture only gives half the story; you need to see how it hangs on the body to make a considered decision.

Place all items you are considering in your online shopping cart. You may find within 48 hours you will receive a discount promotional code from the retailer to sway you to complete the purchase. But don’t let this persuade you unless you really want the item.

Finally, ensure the web address of the payment page begins with ‘https’, not just ‘http’. This ensures it is safe.
