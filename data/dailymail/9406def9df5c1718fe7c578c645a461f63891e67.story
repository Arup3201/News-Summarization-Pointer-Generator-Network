Police are investigating the death of a 17-year-old girl whose body was found after a house party.

The teenager was discovered by a friend at 9am on Friday.

Officers said the death was being treated as 'unexplained' and a post mortem examination would be held to determine the cause of death. 

One neighbour in the village of Ditchling, East Sussex, who asked not to be named, said: 'It is normally such a quiet village – you do not expect this sort of thing to happen. It is absolutely tragic.'

Police are investigating the death of a 17-year-old girl whose body was found after a house party in South Street, Ditchling, East Sussex.

'We did see a man come out of the property looking very distressed, he sat on the tailgate of the ambulance and had his hands behind his head,' another told the Brighton Argus.

Others said they believed the girl attended a secondary school in nearby Lewes.

Yesterday police officers stood guard outside the property and the road was closed for a number of hours as police launched an investigation into the death  

Detective Chief Inspector Mark O'Brien said: 'This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the girl's family and friends at this sad time.

'A post-mortem will be held to determine the cause of her death, but until that time it will be treated as unexplained.'
