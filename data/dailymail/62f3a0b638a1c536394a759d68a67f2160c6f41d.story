Prison: Dental nurse Leonora Sinclair, 50, who was jailed for 10 years

A dental nurse was jailed for 10 years today for killing her husband in a row over what to watch on television.

Leonora Sinclair, 50, wanted to see Harry Hill’s TV Burp while 73-year-old Lloyd insisted on viewing football.

As the row escalated, Mr Sinclair, who had been married for only 10 months, lay bleeding to death in the hallway of their semi-detached home.

Sinclair, of Enfield, north London, was found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in October, but cleared of murder.

Mr Sinclair, who was a driver for a church care centre, was frightened of his wife, who had attacked him on previous occasions.

On the afternoon of Saturday, January 15, she texted a friend: 'I am watching Steel Magnolias and getting pissed on wine while Lloyd makes the dinner. LOL.'

Later they argued about what to watch and Mr Sinclair was fatally stabbed with a large kitchen knife in the back of his left thigh.

Pc Gillian Bills said drunken Sinclair told her on the way to hospital: 'We had an argument about what to watch on TV.

'He wanted to watch football and I wanted to watch Harry Hill.'

Sinclair, who had been married twice before, denied stabbing her husband.

She agreed she had claimed he was injured by falling on a broken wine glass, but said it was in panic.

Judge Stephen Kramer told her: 'I am satisfied you are a domineering person - particularly when you have taken drink.'

She had robbed Mr Sinclair’s family and friends of 'much loved and respected man'.

Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, said Sinclair had set up a 'sham, bogus scene' while her husband was dying.

Sinclair said Mr Sinclair must have stabbed himself by accident after he got her into a headlock and they struggled.

She said: 'He put on Sky Sports and I said I wanted to watch Harry Hill.

'He
got annoyed, he threw his glass down and he said ‘I pay for the TV, I 
pay for Sky and you’re telling me what I can watch’? I put Harry Hill on
and he has gone berserk.'

She sobbed: 'I didn’t stab Lloyd. I did everything possible to save my husband’s life.

'I treated my husband with respect and dignity. I loved my husband.

'I miss my husband - there are certain things on television at the moment which we used to watch together. I can’t watch these things now.'

She added: 'Lloyd usually got home before me so he would cook dinner for us every day.

'Then he would watch TV while I did laundry or housekeeping.

'Lloyd bought me a computer for Christmas. He said I could watch EastEnders on the computer.

'I didn’t really watch telly that much. Lloyd loved telly. He liked Sky Sports. He liked football and cricket.'

She said they were introduced in May 2008 and found an attraction despite being 'like chalk and cheese'.

She added: 'We used to go out every evening. We’d go on holiday and trips. We had fun.'

The court heard there were rows about money after they wed as her wages were paid into an account controlled by her husband.

However the prosecution said it was Sinclair who had been violent and friends and family had noticed injuries.

Miss Cheema said: 'She found an element of enjoyment in humiliating him.

'Lloyd’s friends and family noticed that Leonora Sinclair was prone to bouts of melodrama and selfishness.

'Lloyd would come to work bearing signs of physical injury including bruising to his face.

'When asked about them he would frankly admit they had been caused by Leonora.'

In September last year, Mr Sinclair called police because he said she had 'gone crazy'.

Officers found her in a locked bedroom with a knife, said Miss Cheema.

Mr Sinclair, who divorced his first wife some years earlier and had four grown-up children, had told his son Vincent that Leonora had broken his arm.

Work colleague Ahmed Youseff told the court he saw Mr Sinclair limping and with facial bruising.

He said: 'I lost count of the number of injuries. He always had an injury.'

Monica Thompson, pastor of the Ministry of Praise in Tottenham, said she had been a friend of 'Brother Lloydy' for many years.

He was a deacon and would drive others to help feed people on the street.

She said he was a 'very charming, easy-going person' who had put four children through university.

She used to ride with him to church on Sundays but stopped because of the violent rows she witnessed between the couple in the car.

The final straw came when she saw Sinclair beating Lloyd up outside her home.

She said: 'He was very calm as usual while she was raging at him. I got the impression he was afraid of her.

'His face was swollen up after that. She was hitting him in his face and everywhere. He was quite shocked.'

Mr Sinclair’s son Vincent said his father told him: 'She keeps hitting me.' He was upset and his face was scratched.

Family friend Sonia Grieves told police that two years before his death she had witnessed Sinclair ordering her husband out of the house to buy her wine and cigarettes.

She said she saw Sinclair kick him out of the door.
