Two burglars who stole £200,000 worth of jewellery, laptops and computer games have been jailed after a suspicious resident took pictures of them as they staked out houses.

Stuart Edey, 33, and Jason Sultana, 32, who together committed 100 offences, were jailed for almost seven years between them on Tuesday.

The photographs were taken by an anonymous resident in May who saw the pair acting suspiciously outside his home in the village of Llantwit Fardre, near Cardiff.

Burglars Jason Sultana, 32, and Stuart Edey, 33, were jailed after an alert resident took these pictures of the men when he saw them acting suspiciously outside his home and told police

South Wales Police were able to 
match up the images to CCTV footage from a local supermarket.

A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'The high quality of the pictures taken by the resident enabled officers
to make an exact match between trainers found in Sultana's house and 
those he is wearing in the photograph - using the pattern on the sole.'

Detectives matched the sole of the trainer to one found at Jason Sultana's flat

The burglars targeted homes during the day in the Bridgend, Taff Ely, Cardiff and Neath areas over several weeks.

The photographer has been praised by detectives, who said Edey and Sultana could still be offending without his intervention. 

Detective Chief Inspector Andy 
Valentine said: 'I can't praise the photographer enough.

'He took 
responsibility and acted on his instincts to report suspicious 
behaviour, which is what we asked people to do at the time when the 
burglaries were being reported.

'We
had a team of officers working hard to catch these burglars and this 
was the breakthrough they needed; the images were absolutely key to our 
investigation.'

Stuart Edey, 33, of Ely, admitted eight offences including burglary, attempted burglary and handling at Cardiff Crown Court. 

He told the court that he wanted to apologise to victims who had returned to find their homes violated.

Edey also claimed he had not entered any of the houses himself and was simply the getaway driver.

Jailing
him for four and half years, Recorder Catherine Brown said: 'The driver
is just as guilty as the person who does go in. You get no credit at 
all for only being the driver.'

Jason Sultana, 32, of Cardiff, was given two years and four months.

He admitted being with Edey at two burglaries, in Llanharan on May 13 and Bridgend four days later.

A third defendant, Polish-born Rafel Skowyra, 31, of  Ely, also pleaded guilty to being involved at Maes y Piod where a laptop, games and £2,000 worth of jewellery was taken. He was given an 18-month jail sentence.

Victims were said to have spoken of the 'massive intrusion'.

One man, whose Pontyclun home was targeted while he was away for a few days, has since put it up for sale.

The judge said: 'It's not surprising the impact it had on him. He had already been burgled before.'
