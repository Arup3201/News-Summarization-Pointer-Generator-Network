This dramatic CCTV footage captures the moment a shop worker says he fearlessly disarmed a man who was said to be pointing a gun in his face whilst attempting to rob the store.

Hunar Mohammed, 37, says he was working behind the counter at the shop in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire on Saturday night when a man came in and asked for cigarettes and alcohol.

As the father placed the items in a bag and worked out how much was owed, the man allegedly withdrew a gun and demanded the money from the till.

Displaying astonishing calm, Mr Mohammed says he snatched the weapon, which was apparently a replica firearm in the blink of an eye.

The shopkeeper, who is from Sulaymaniyah in Kurdistan, said he was not frightened during the episode as most people in his country carry guns for security.

He said: 'It's the first time this has ever happened in my life but I wasn't that scared as everyone has guns in my country that they keep for security.

'I've handled a gun before as well. I did what any normal person would do. In this second, my mind said to do this and I did it.

Mr Mohammed, who has a three-year-old daughter, added: 'He didn't leave with anything and for that I am glad.

'My family have said congratulations to me. My wife was scared  but she is okay now.

'My step-sons couldn't believe it. They asked "How did you do that so quickly?"'

Mr Mohammed's account of the incident has turned the shopkeeper into a local hero.

Mr Mohammed, who moved to the UK in 2010, said: 'All the regular customers have been coming in and calling me a hero and asking to shake my hand. 

'It hasn't left me frightened to go back to work or anything.'

A man from Borehamwood, 24, has been charged with robbery and having an imitation firearm.
