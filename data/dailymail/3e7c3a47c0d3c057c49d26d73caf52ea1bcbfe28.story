The European Union has named 18 Ukrainians who will have their assets frozen including the country's ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, his son and former Prime Minister Mykola Azarov.

The 28-nation bloc revealed the names of those it believes are responsible for embezzling state funds in Ukraine this morning.

The list includes what appears to be Yanukovych's closest aides, including a former interior minister, justice minister, the prosecutor general, the head of the security services and Yanukovych's son.

The sanctions also target former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his son. 

The EU said yesterday it was freezing assets of Ukrainian officials held in the EU but did not name them pending the publication in the official legal journal today.

Meanwhile, China has agreed with the United States that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must be respected in its dispute with Russia, according to the White House.

China is treading a cautious path in the Ukraine dispute, withholding criticism of strategic partner Russia while adhering to its traditional policy of not interfering in the affairs of other countries.

President Barack Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, spoke to Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi about the Ukraine situation.

A White House statement outlining what was discussed said the two officials reaffirmed the importance to U.S.-China relations of deepening 'practical cooperation to address regional and global challenges.'

'They also agreed that the United States and China share an interest in supporting efforts to identify a peaceful resolution to the ongoing dispute between Russia and Ukraine that is based on respect for international law and upholds Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,' the statement said.

The United States has engaged in global diplomatic efforts to gather opposition against Russia's deployment of troops in the Crimea region of southern Ukraine.

Obama spoke earlier to Prime Minister David Cameron.

Vice President Joe Biden talked by phone with Latvian President Andris Berzins to underscore the United States' commitment to peace and security in the Baltic region.

Yesterday a video emerged of the moment a UN special envoy was forced to take refuge after being threatened at gunpoint by ten to 15 men and told to leave Crimea.

Dutch diplomat Robert Serry retreated into a café after the men told him they were under orders to take him to the airport and got into his car.

Crowds gathered outside the café, some armed and some in paramilitary uniform, chanting ‘Russia! Russia!’

Mr Serry was escorted out into a vehicle which was immediately surrounded by 100 demonstrators, some waving Russian flags, before police pushed a way through and accompanied the vehicle to the airport

Mr Serry was forced to cut short his mission to the disputed region after being ordered to leave, UN officials said.

Mr Serry was escorted out into a vehicle which was immediately surrounded by 100 demonstrators, some waving Russian flags and beating on the windows, before police pushed a way through and accompanied the vehicle to the airport.
