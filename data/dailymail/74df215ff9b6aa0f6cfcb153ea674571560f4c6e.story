A former hand surgeon who is no stranger to legal battles, is in trouble again after he allegedly grabbed a flight attendant by the neck during a recent transatlantic flight.

Michael Glyn Brown, of Houston, Texas, is accused of making 'rude sexual comments' to the flight attendant as he grabbed her during a January 2 flight from London to Miami.

The flight attendant told authorities that she was able to pull away from Brown's grasp but alleged that his behavior continued after she returned to serve him a some food.

Allegations: Michael Glyn Brown, pictured in court in 2011, is accused of making 'rude sexual comments' to the flight attendant as he grabbed her during a January 2 flight from London to Miami

A criminal complaint obtained by the Houston Chronicle said that Brown knocked over the meal as he wrapped his hands around her neck and began to squeeze, and asked her 'are you a strong woman?'

When another flight attendant came over, the complaint stated that Brown grabbed her also and held them by his forearms.

The Chronicle reported that Brown then said he was going to 'get naked' and remarked about the 'sexual' things he wanted to do to the women.

Eventually, the flight crew was able to get Brown calm, and he soon fell asleep for the remainder of the flight. When the plane landed, he was taken into custody.

Brown's New York City-based attorney, Robert Hantman, told MailOnline that the stress of his most recent divorce has Brown 'distressed and distraught' because he cannot see his children.

Mr Hantman said that Brown had taken a 
sleep aid called Restoril, which lists sleepwalking as a side effect. 
He said that he awoke with no knowledge of the episode.

He said: '[Brown] doesn't remember what happened but is obviously apologetic.'

Brown reportedly told investigators after the incident that he 'may have touched a flight attendant but not in a violent or inappropriate way,' according to the complaint.

Two years ago, Brown went to trial accused of throwing a humanitarian award and two heavy vases at his fourth ex-wife Rachel Brown in August 2010, and was found not guilty.

The early morning fight ended with Michael Brown being arrested for domestic violence at his home in the Memorial area of Houston, Texas.

Before police arrived, Brown had to be 'taken down' by his own bodyguard after allegedly twisting his wife's arm behind her back, Assistant Harris County District Attorney Nathan Hennigan said at the time.

Last year, Brown was the subject of a lawsuit involving a woman using the pseudonym Chris Stevens, who claims to be Brown's former lover, said he lied about his health and gave her vaginal and anal herpes during their affair.

The suit said that in December 2011, the woman found out she had vaginal and anal herpes.

She got the latter because Brown refused to wear a condom and 'forcibly had anal sex with the plaintiff,' the suit alleged.

Brown's carpal tunnel clinic, the Brown Hand Center, is well-known in Houston for TV commercials in which Brown appears with his now ex-wife Rachel Brown and several children.

The clinic, which also has locations in Phoenix, Dallas, Austin and Las Vegas, employs several surgeons.

The business remains open despite Brown's medical license being revoked after he tested positive for cocaine in 2006, but he is remains at the helm of the operation.

Business: Brown's carpal tunnel clinic, the Brown Hand Center, which also has locations in Phoenix, Dallas, Austin and Las Vegas, has about 400 staffmembers

Mr Hantman confirmed that Brown recently
filed for bankruptcy to give himself some 'breathing room' from legal 
fees stemming from the divorce battle with his fourth wife.

He said that his client will then be free to 'move forward and provide the cures for many people with carpal tunnel and improve peopleâ€™s lives.'

Mr Hantman added: 'He just wants to see his children, be fair with his wife and move on with his life.'

Since the divorce, Rachel Brown has been romantically linked to former Houston Astros star Jeff Bagwell.
