Harvard has set up a task force to evaluate its sexual assault policy after a student penned a scathing op-ed about the Ivy League university's indifference to her alleged attack.

The student, who wrote the letter anonymously for The Harvard Crimson, said staff discouraged her from pursuing charges against her attacker, meaning she is still living in the same dorm as he is.

Following the emotional response to the article, Harvard's Undergraduate Council has set up a task force to discuss the university's sexual assault policy, which the student branded 'outdated'.

University officials sent a letter to undergraduates saying they will support the group, ABC reported.

A Harvard student has written a damning open letter attacking the University's indifference to an alleged sexual assault from another student

'Harvard College as an institution and as
 a community deplores sexual violence and is committed to its prevention
 and to supporting its victims,' Stephen Lassonde, dean of student
 life, wrote in the letter. 'Sexual harassment and sexual assault can never be tolerated.

He said that the results of the task force would be shared with the entire community.

He added: 'To build a community free of sexual 
violence and harassment will require all of us working together. We take this issue very seriously and it is our hope 
that no student feels discouraged from reporting an incident.'

It comes just days after the student wrote in the letter titled 'Dear Harvard: You win' that the alleged incident happened in a friend's dorm room on a Friday night 'after too many drinks' last year.

She said the attacker took her shirt off and started biting her skin.

'I
 pushed back on his chest and asked him to stop kissing me aggressively.
 He laughed. He said that I should 'just wear a scarf' to cover the 
marks. He continued to abuse my body.

'I
 was intoxicated, I was in pain, I was trapped between him and the wall,
 and I was scared to death that he would continue to ignore what I said.

Lack of support: The student claims she was 
discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because 
her assault did not fit the narrow language of Harvard's student 
handbook (file photo)

'I stopped everything and turned my back to him, praying he would leave 
me alone.'

She writes how he started getting impatient and made an explicit demand to which she wrote: 'It did not sound like a question. I obeyed.'

The student then writes that she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of Harvard’s student handbook, written in 1993.

'When I told my House Master that I was considering an Ad Board process, I was told it was a bad time of the semester, that there would be consequences for my assailant anyway, and that we shouldn’t go through the process if it was going to be fruitless,' she wrote.

'Shortly after, my resident dean told me that my assailant couldn’t be punished because he didn’t know what he was doing. The resident dean compared living in the same House as my assailant to a divorced couple working in the same factory.'

She explains that although she was offered the chance to move to another House early on she declined because 'transferring felt utterly disempowering. Moving to a different House would have felt like giving up and granting even more power to my assailant.'

She said she is now on anti-depressants and is now falling behind on her school work because she finds it difficult seeing her alleged attacker up to five times a day .

'I spend most of my time outside of class curled up in bed, crying, sleeping, or staring at the ceiling, occasionally wondering if I just heard my assailant’s voice in the staircase.'

She added: 'I will be moving out of my House next semester, if only - quite literally - to save my life.'

According to the Centers for Disease Control, 19 percent of undergraduate women experience attempted or completed sexual assault since starting college.

According to AAUW 42 per cent of college women who are raped tell no one about the assault.
