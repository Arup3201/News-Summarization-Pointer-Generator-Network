Older people with lung cancer are much less likely to be given life-saving surgery than the young, it has been revealed.

Those aged 75 or over were five times less likely to have an operation even if they were in good health and their cancer had not spread.

The research by Macmillan Cancer Support, with Monitor Deloitte and Public Health England, adds to mounting evidence of age discrimination in NHS treatment.

Experts say there are complex reasons why older patients may not receive surgery, including other serious health conditions or if the cancer has spread.

But Ciaran Devane, chief executive at Macmillan, said that isn’t the whole picture.

Assessment methods are often inadequate, he said, meaning that many older cancer patients’ treatment is chosen based on their age alone, not their fitness.

The charity also found older patients are more likely to have difficulties getting to hospital, or to decide not to have surgery.

Mr Devane said: ‘I just cannot comprehend why healthy older lung cancer patients are given less life-saving surgery than younger patients, despite the fact that many could survive for years afterwards.’

Older patients are far more likely to survive if they have surgery, studies show.

Among the ‘healthiest’ over-65s, two-thirds of those who have surgery are alive seven years later. Just one in 70 of those who do not have surgery will live that long. A report this year found five-year survival rates for patients 75 and over in England and Wales are among the worst in Europe – 44 per cent worse for lung cancer patients.

Inequality: Caroline Abrahams, director of charity Age UK, said the figures suggest there is still age discrimination in the NHS

Campaigners said older patients were ‘written off as too old’ by the NHS. Mr Devane said: ‘It is deeply sad that our survival rates in this age group continue to lag behind Europe. We should not send a message to older patients that it is okay to discriminate.

‘If we don’t take heed of these figures now, things will get worse.

‘The UK should match the best in Europe, not the worst. The NHS must ensure every older patient is treated based on their overall fitness, not their chronological age.’

Sue O’Lone, from London, said her grandmother had experienced discrimination.

The 32-year-old said: ‘My grandmother was 80 when  she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2007. It wasn’t advanced as far as we were aware but all she was offered was a bit of radiotherapy.

‘She was given no support, and no effort was put into her care. I really do feel they saw her as an old woman and they weren’t going to bother much.

She was shunted between health authorities who seemed reluctant to take responsibility for her, and died a year later in hospital after an emergency admission.’

Caroline Abrahams, director of charity Age UK, said: ‘This research once again demonstrates that older people can experience discrimination within the NHS and that the chances of receiving high-quality care are all too often stacked against them.’

She added: ‘Where a patient and their doctor agree that treatment for lung cancer, or any condition, would be safe and of benefit, they should be able to have it regardless of their age. Decisions about who should and should not be given surgery should be based purely on clinical need – anything else is blatant age discrimination.’

Around 38,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year. In England, only 29 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women with the disease survive for one year.

A large study found most women  did not meet national guidelines for physical activity after their diagnosis

Exercise can help breast cancer survivors live longer – but two out of three are doing too little, researchers say.

A large study found most women  did not meet national guidelines for physical activity after their diagnosis.

Only 35 per cent of breast cancer  survivors were doing at least half an hour a day of moderate activity, says research published online in Cancer, an American Cancer Society journal.

Although the study was carried out in the US, British experts said survivors here need more support to increase and maintain exercise levels.

The study assessed physical activity in 1,735 women aged 20 to 74 before and after they were diagnosed with breast cancer. The team led by Brionna Hair, of the University of North Carolina, found almost two-thirds of women were less active six months after diagnosis than they had been before.

Miss Hair said ways of getting women active should be ‘comprehensively evaluated and implemented’.

In the UK, 50,000 women and 400 men develop breast cancer each year.

They are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity, such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, including running or aerobics, every week.French research this year found exercising for an hour a day cut women’s risk of breast cancer by 11 per cent.
