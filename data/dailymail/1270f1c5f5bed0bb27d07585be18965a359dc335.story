It was once a grand 18th century canal - the hub of a thriving salt trade which brought wealth to the townsfolk of Droitwich in Worcestershire.

But by 1939, unable to compete with the rise of railways, it lay abandoned and gradually became overgrown and silted up.

Now, a team of volunteers who restored the waterway after removing 300,000 tons of mud have won an English Heritage Angels award for their efforts.

From silted-up sorrow...

... now restored to glory

During a 38-year project, a team of volunteers restored the waterway after removing 300,000 tons of mud. Campaigner Max Sinclair received an English Heritage Angels award in honour of their achievement

The annual competition celebrates 
the work of local people striving to save England's heritage and is sponsored by 
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Max Sinclair, who began a campaign to restore the Droitwich Canals in 1963, was presented with the prize for Best Rescue of a Historic Industrial Building or Site at the Palace Theatre in London yesterday.

This year's judging panel included Melvyn Bragg and historian Bettany Hughes, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The Droitwich Barge Canal opened in 1771, linking Droitwich Spa to the River Severn.

In 1854, the Droitwich Junction Canal - a narrow waterway linking to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal  - was opened.

The Barge section was initially a commercial success.

1854: Second section, Junction Canal opens.

1939: Decline in economic viability leads to canals' abandonment.

1963: Max Sinclair begins his restoration campaign

1973: Droitwich Canals Trust established; volunteer work begins

2000: Three locks on Junction Canal completed

By 2011: Droitwich Canals finally reopen

However, by 1830, business began to decline when a source of brine was found at Stoke Prior, to the north-east of Droitwich.

Much of the salt was transported more economically overland towards the north.

In 1973, Mr Sinclair's lobbying led to the creation of the Droitwich Canals Trust.

Since then, thousands of volunteers from the trust have undertaken management of the channel and towpath and raised funds for the restoration.

In 2000, the first three locks on the Junction Canal were fully completed.

Further funding, including £12.7million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, saw the restoration of nine broad locks, the building of a new bridge, just over half a mile of new canal and four new locks.

In addition, five miles of canal were dredged, and a 5.5 hectare reed bed was made.

Finally, after 38 years of restoration, the Droitwich Canals were opened in July 2011.

The canals form part of a navigable 27-mile ring passing through Worcester and Droitwich.

More than 3,000 boats have used the canal and there has been a 30 per cent increase in towpath users and 50 per cent in visitors to the local tourist information centre.

It is predicted that the fruits of the restoration scheme will attract a further 330,000 visitors to the area within five years.

Speaking in 2003, James Thompson, 
British Waterways' Droitwich then project manager, said: 'This is one of
our flagship restoration projects, demonstrating the active role that 
canals can play in helping boost the local economy and regenerate 
surrounding areas.

'This 
scheme will make Droitwich the fifth most visited tourist attraction in 
Worcestershire, helping to place the town at the forefront of the 
region's growing tourist economy.'
