A man has risked his own life to save a little boy from suffocating after he was left dangling from a building with his head trapped in a window grid.

Neighbour Zhou Bo went outside of his own property after hearing a commotion in the street in Lingwu, Ningxia, China.

It was then he spotted the young boy dangling from a fourth-storey window with his head wedged between metal bars.

Helping hand: Zhou Bo went to the aid of a young boy left dangling from a fourth-storey window after getting his head stuck in a grid in Lingwu, Ningxia, China

Dangerous: Zhou Bo managed to prevent the boy from suffocating by holding him up by his feet while also balancing on stool perched on a window sill

He said: 'I went there, and saw a boy dangling in the air, as his head was stuck in between the window grid.'

Zhou could see that the boy was suffocating as his feet had nothing to stand on.

He dashed inside and raced up to the flat but found the door locked. He then went one floor below but discovered that the gap between that window and the dangling boy was too great.

Zhou said: 'Without help, the boy would be suffocated soon, or he has the danger of dropping down'.

So Zhou found a chair and balanced it precariously on the third-storey window ledge before standing on it and supporting the trapped boy's feet from underneath. 

'I felt time froze, and my arms went numb but firemen still didn't arrive,' said Zhou.

Finally, firefighters arrived 40 minutes later and were able to break into the apartment and pull the boy, who had been left home alone, to safety.

Waiting game: Zhou Bo had to hold the position for 40 minutes until firefighters arrived at the scene

Safe and sound: The young boy pictured with his mother after being released from the window grid
