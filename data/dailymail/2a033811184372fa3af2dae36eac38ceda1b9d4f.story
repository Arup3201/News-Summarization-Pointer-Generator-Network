The Arsenal squad are on their way to Istanbul as they prepare for the Champions League qualifying first leg against Besiktas on Tuesday night.

The likes of Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers seemed to be in a relaxed mood ahead of the crunch clash against Slaven Bilic's Besiktas.

Oxlade-Chamberlain took to Instagram to share a selfie with Chambers as he posted: 'On the plane ready to leave for Turkey with my protege @chambers1995 brought the baby face back too... Beard goneeee' (sic).

Arsene Wenger's side will be wary of former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, who is the Turkish team's top striker after his summer move.

Ba scored twice against Arsenal in December 2012 in his last game for Newcastle before joining the Blues, but came close to joining the north London club in January last season before Jose Mourinho decided he didn't want to strengthen an opponent. 

Arsenal started the Premier League season with a 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on Saturday, but needed a later winner from Aaron Ramsey to grab all three points after a disappointing display.

'Besiktas had a convincing result against Feyenoord,' Wenger said, 'and so for us we have the luck to play the first game away.'
