Mathieu Valbuena broke down in tears on Tuesday afternoon as he said his goodbyes to Marseille with an official farewell press conference.

The diminutive Frenchman has signed a three-year deal with Dynamo Moscow after eight years at the French side, winning the French Ligue 1 with them in 2010.

His old team have even decided to retire his squad number to mark his absence.

Emotional: Valbuena couldn't hide his emotions in the final press conference for Marseille

Starry eyed: Valbuena spoke passionately about his eight years at Marseille

After a stop-start season last time out the 29-year-old caught the eye of a number of suitors this summer after a string of impressive performances at the World Cup with France, with QPR and West Ham both showing an interest in the diminutive winger.

But Valbuena had his heart set on a move to Russia joining Dynamo for a reported £7million, as he closed the door on his time at Marseille.

In a press conference streamed live on the club's website he said: 'There is a lot of emotion. I promised myself not to cry but I spent eight years here, I experienced fantastic things, titles, league cups. I'm proud of all of that but the page turns today.

'I did so much here and everything OM has given me has been positive. All of my coaches have mattered to me but I don't forget Jose Anigo and Pape Diouf who trusted in me when I was coming from a small club.'

Passionate: Valbuena spoke in length about his experiences at the Stade Velodrome

Marseille president Vincent Labrune hailed Valbuena for his service to the club adding:

'He is an iconic player who helped write the club's history throughout the first part of the twenty-first century.

'He is one of the longest-serving players of Marseille. He showed great love for the club.

'I want, on behalf of all the supporters and members of the club, to thank him for representing the club's colours for eight years. We lose a great player, a big part of the team. An important page turns. I hope he can do well in Russia.'
