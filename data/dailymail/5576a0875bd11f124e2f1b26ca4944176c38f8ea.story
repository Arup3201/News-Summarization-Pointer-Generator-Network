A flood of sex abuse victims are expected to come forward in the wake of a new lawsuit filed against Michael Jackson, the MailOnline has learned.

James Safechuck, 36, is suing the Jackson estate claiming he was abused by the King of Pop after the two appeared together in a 1988 Pepsi ad when he was aged 10.

James claims the pop star went on to molest him for years up until the age of 14. He has added his name to a previous suit filed last year by 31-year-old Wade Robson, an Australian former-choreographer who claims Jackson sexually abused him at a young age.

Victim: James Safechuck, now 36, has come forward to claim sex abuse. A source close to his legal team say it could prompt a 'flood' a similar complaints against Jackson's estate

Sources have revealed to MailOnline that his legal team believe his case is so strong that it will likely inspire ‘dozens’ more victims of abuse to come forward and share their accounts of the singer.

One source close to James’ lawyer said: ‘We think that James’ case might well prompt a flood of other victims to come forward. The idea that some people take years and years to come to terms with this kind of abuse is very typical.

'We believe that James coming forward will inspire others to do the same. There could be dozens more victims of Michael Jackson out there.’

The lawsuit filed last week remains sealed, but it’s believed James, a computer programmer who is married with two children and lives in Van Nuys, California, met Jackson when the pair starred in the Pepsi commercial.

James was acting the part of a young boy who sneaks into the singer's dressing room during a concert and eventually meets his idol.

During 1988, the year the commercial was shot, James followed Jackson around the world - attending concerts in Paris, Los Angeles, and London.

He was also photographed with the star attending a Pepsi conference in Hawaii and seeing the premiere of The Phantom of the Opera musical on Broadway along with Liza Minelli.

Jackson even treated James to a shopping spree at F.A.O. Schwarz toy store on that New York trip.

A sex abuse victims’ group also believes James’ account could give many more victims the courage to finally come forward.

David Clohessy, Executive Director of SNAP, the Survivors' Network of those Abused by Priests, told MailOnline: ‘Given Michael Jackson’s popularity and prominence, now victim James Safechuck has come forward, there certainly could be a flood of other victims coming out.

‘We hope that this brave man’s courage will inspire many others to come forward. There could be dozens and dozens and we hope they start to speak up.

‘Some will blast Jackson's latest accuser for his timing. That's wrong. If kids are to be safe from predators, adults must welcome – indeed, be grateful for – abuse reports no matter when they happen.'

He added: ‘We hope every single person who saw, suspected or suffered child sex crimes by Jackson will find the courage to step forward.’

Jackson went on trial in 2005 accused of molesting 13-year-old cancer survivor Gavin Arvizo at his Neverland ranch two years earlier and James featured in the trial.

Prosecutors gathered testimony from several Neverland Ranch workers who said they feared James was an abuse victim.

Several workers say he was a frequent guest and an estate manager testified that he saw Jackson standing in a Jacuzzi with his hands 'down the front of Jimmy's underpants and was manipulating the boy's genitalia'.

A maid at the ranch said she saw the two in bed together, nude from the waist up, on two different occasions.

Witness: One Neverland Ranch maid said in 2005 that she saw Jackson and Safechuck naked from the waist up in bed together on two different occasions

But James never co-operated with prosecutors -  he changed his mind when he became a father and underwent therapy.

Because of his change of heart, a judge ruled that the allegations wouldn't be included in the trial. Jackson was later acquitted of all charges.

Yesterday the MailOnline visited James’ family home in a smart suburb of Van Nuys and spoke to his wife,

She would only say: ‘James is not in. He is not doing this for the money, that’s not what this is about.’

James' lawyer Maryann Marzano, a partner at Gradstein & Marzano in LA, said in a statement: 'If there is still any question about the predatory nature of Michael Jackson’s so-called "friendships" with young boys, it should be laid to rest by the indisputable facts of what Michael did to James Safechuck.

'Those facts are set forth in the Complaint that James Safechuck filed in L.A. Superior Court last Friday, May 9, 2014.'

The attorney for Jackson's estate, Howard Weitzman, has called the claims 'false and scurrilous'.
