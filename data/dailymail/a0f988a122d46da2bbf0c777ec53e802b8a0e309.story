Obviously, it is still just golf. And there’s nothing wrong with that. Except of course, it’s not. 

The Ryder Cup makes golf feel like so much more than just a game. And you’d be hard pressed to find a more engrossing sporting event with which to fill up a corner of your front room over a long weekend.

Which is something Sky Sports clearly decided they were really going to embrace on the Cup’s trip to this side of the Atlantic. They even created a unique channel for the tournament.

Having this much time to play with afforded them time to digress from the action. This certainly came in the shape of the Ryder Cup concert which featured an array of music of which you could at least say, well, Midge Ure, he’s Scottish! But it meant nothing to me, Vienna. Where was the golf theme?

I’d have opened with Culture Club, followed by Professor Green. Then Iron Maiden for the finale. ‘Colin Colin Colin Colin, Colin Montgomery, you come and go’. Would have brought the house down, no?

There was also the golf equivalent of Sky’s cricket autopsy show, The Verdict. Although, Sara Stirk with David Howell and Nick Dougherty couldn't quite generate that show’s sparks in their re-living of the day’s play. And their attempt to do a little comedy skit about the US uniforms was, shall we say, not really part of their skill set.

But these are just a couple of nibbles amongst what was a quite magnificent spread of action. All set off by the real star of the show for me, the Gleneagles course itself. A massive part of making golf so appealing as a TV sport for anyone other than the truly devoted is the backdrop.

The Ryder Cup concert in Glasgow was spectacular but didn't have a golf theme

The beautiful Gleneagles course attracted thousands of spectators over the three days of competition 

The Masters, with its dazzling light and rich array of bright colours, is a prime example. But the sumptuous shades of green - splattered with rainbow-coloured flower beds of fans - that made up Gleneagles’ pallet were just as captivating. 

That, and the Turner-like skies that the players were frequently launching the ball into. Give Mother Nature her due. When she’s really on her game, she delivers! The Moors, the merrier.

So once you’ve been handed a setting on a plate, it is then down to the telly to deliver. This I thought happened in swathes across the weekend. Including - and I know it may be a bit fancy, too ‘techy’ for the purist - the bright graphic ribbon that accompanied so many of the drives. Instructive, and it looked great slicing its way through the sombre array of silvers and greys of the skyline.

Having said that, the money shot of the whole weekend, for me, was the aerial view of the 9th tee. Capturing the drive from the side rather than behind, this needed no computer wizardry. All that was required was the ball to fly across the rich tapestry of the Gleneagles course.

Then there was a bunch of fellas playing a few rounds of golf. Their contribution was set up perfectly on the morning of day three from Sky Sports’ excellent fishtank of a studio. Darren Clarke and Monty for the blues, with Butch Harmon and Jack Nicklaus on the red side, were engrossing in their analysis of what had gone, and what was yet to come. And all that with a burgeoning crowd in the background already roused into song.

Lest we forget, though, the first couple of days were none too shoddy. Bruce Critchley summed it up beautifully in commentary on Saturday when he spoke of ‘that illusive snake oil: momentum’. 

This was followed by Monty at his most prophetic, saying he hoped a holed putt by Ian Poulter would ‘get (him) into Ryder Cup mode’. It wasn’t too much later that the chip in on the 15th had Poults celebrating in time honoured style.

But perhaps best of all was an intimate moment, captured casually on mic, which gave us a welcome insight into the business end of this tournament. Rory had just launched a beauty from the 9th. And just like your mate might if you were having a sneaky nine on your local course, Poults muttered ‘great drive, that’.

Day three is a different animal, though. It’s the concept of going 'mano a mano', but with a whole team, indeed continent, behind you. And it had the pictures to match. 

Not many people are going to forget USA rookie Patrick Reed’s sssshing of the crowd and Michael Van Gerwen impressions. Nor the indomitable Justin Rose, having played his miracle shot from under a tree, turning to the camera and saying ‘a bit of Seve for you’. And of course the maelstrom of pictures that resulted from Jamie Donaldson’s incredible approach on the 15th.

But perhaps the most vivid of them all for me went back to the players’ winding walks down to the first tee, when Rose touched fists with the image of Seve. And Sergio Garcia left his fellow countryman a little kiss on the cheek.

Sky Ryder Cup succeeded in delivering ‘sport event TV’ at its grandest. But in those couple of intimate moments, we witnessed its true spirit.
