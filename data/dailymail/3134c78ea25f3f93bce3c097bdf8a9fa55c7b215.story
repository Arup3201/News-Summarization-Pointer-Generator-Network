Fashion has never been known for its love of fat. From size zero scandals to revelations that models eat tissues to stay slim, the pressure to be slender is on.

But one group of fashionistas is bucking the skinny trend.

The last few years have seen an explosion in 'fatshionista' blogs, with the curvy girls behind them stepping away from the computer and into the style spotlight.

Two of the most popular are Fuller Figure, Fuller Bust's Georgina Horne and Arched Eyebrow supremo, Bethany Rutter - both of whom star in Clements Ribeiro's new campaign for Evans.

Despite their success and undoubted grasp of style, the pair have complained that the media - and the fashion industry as a whole - still fails to recognise that larger women want cool clothes too.

'[Fatshion blogging has become popular] simply because we don't have a face or a
 voice anywhere else,' explains Rutter, 22.

'All UK fashion journalism is written by 
slim people for slim people, so there's almost no point reading 
magazines if you're fat.

'That's why the internet's become such an 
important place for plus-size fashion.'

Horne, 23, adds: 'Plus size 
bloggers are women who are not afraid to admit to being bigger, happy 
and fashionable.

'With so much pressure to shift those extra pounds and 
tone up for summer, we are a breath of fresh air. It's OK to be fat. Fat
 doesn't mean unhealthy, undesirable or a failure. It's just a size.'

What's more, notes Rutter, ignoring bigger women puts the fashion industry at odds with one of the biggest social trends of the last 50 years: the fact that people are getting fatter.

Outdated: According to Rutter, fashion industry attitudes are very last season

According to the Department of Health, 'in England, most people are overweight or obese.'

And statistics released by the government would appear to back this up, with 61.3 per cent of adults and 30 per cent of children aged between 2 and 15 either overweight or obese. 

Health problems associated with being overweight or obese cost the NHS more than £5 billion every year.

'We know 
people are getting bigger - that's a fact,' explains Rutter. 'The sooner fashion catches onto that the better.'

Despite their complaints, it seems that some parts of the fashion industry are beginning to take note, not least husband and wife design duo, Clements Ribeiro.

The pair have created a directional collection for plus-size emporium, Evans, which includes chic dresses and wearable little tops festooned with lashings of their trademark colourful print.

'After three collections in which we tried to create smart capsule wardrobes, including some serious eveningwear, we decided to come up with a surprise turn by creating a holiday range that is playful and easy,' explained Ignacio Ribeiro.

'The shapes are very casual and straightforward and the prints are full of wit. It is infused with the urban energy the bloggers inspired us with, but also ready for a week of fun in Rio.

Along with Rutter and Horne, other 'fatshion' bloggers to star in the campaign include UK writer, Callie Thorne and US fatshionistas, Nicolette Mason and Marie Denee.

Do you feel that the fashion industry is
 moving away from its thin ideal?

Personally, I don't see 'thin' or 'fat' 
or any other shapes or sized as a fashion choice.

Some women are 
naturally thin, some want to be thin, and fashion is not necessarily to 
blame or the only influence.

What I do think is that larger women are 
becoming more vocal and proud to be bigger. Not all of them want to lose
 weight and wear baggy sacks until it happens - they want choices, 
patterns, colours, daring cuts, a range of prices.

They want to see 
women who can wear those clothes modelling them, and they wants people 
to accept these facts. It's great to see an increase of larger models, 
if only they weren't called 'plus' size when they're not.

Do you have any tips for bigger girls who need a self-esteem boost?

First and foremost - confidence can not 
be gained by putting others down.

'Real woman have curves' and 'I'd 
rather be hungry than have diabetes' are stupid phrases that empower no 
one.

Be happy with yourself, and if you're not, and you can make 
positive changes then do so. Listen to the compliments people give you, 
not the insults.

    

    What was your favourite part of the Evans shoot?

My favourite part was actually spending 
time with all the girls.

Those four ladies are so inspiring and 
passionate and I loved hearing such an intelligent debate take place. 

Do you feel that the fashion industry is
 moving away from its thin ideal?

Yes! It's definitely upped its game 
since realising how much money there is in plus size fashion.

We know 
people are getting bigger - that's a fact - and the sooner fashion catches onto that the better.

The high street is a bit of a 
wasteland if you're fat - most branches of H&M and New Look just 
don't seem to carry their plus ranges, so that could definitely be 
improved.

I'm really grateful for the Swan collection because it shows 
Evans knows how to treat women who want sleek, chic, fun pieces on the 
high street, available for fat women.
  Do you have any tips for bigger girls who need a self-esteem boost?

Get online! Create conversations on 
Twitter, find a support network of fellow fat girls, be inspired by what
 others are wearing, find your feet by looking at endless photos of 
sassy plus size women on Tumblr.

Knowing you're not alone makes a 
massive difference. 
  
  What was your favourite part of the Evans shoot?

Getting to meet Nicolette and Marie 
(who are, honestly, inspirations for the places you can go with fatshion
 if you work hard and are given the right platform), and hang out with 
Georgina and Callie who I already knew!

Oh and play 
with loads of fun clothes and accessories, AND meet loads of great new 
people who are making such an effort to keep Evans up to date.
