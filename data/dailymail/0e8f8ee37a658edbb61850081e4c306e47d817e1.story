World Cup-winning captain Cafu has sensationally claimed that he was thrown out of the Brazil dressing room after their 7-1 thrashing by Germany.

Cafu led Brazil to World Cup success in Japan and South Korea in 2002, and was also part of their squad which triumphed in the United States eight years earlier.

The 44-year-old, who ended his playing days with AC Milan in 2008, visited his dejected compatriots following their humbling 7-1 loss to Germany on Tuesday evening.

Making his point: Cafu, the 2002 World Cup-winning skipper, has claimed he was asked to leave Brazil's dressing room

But he claims the Brazil's football federation president Jose Maria Marin asked him to leave.

'Jose Maria Marin said he didn't want any strange people in the dressing room,' Cafu is quoted as saying.

'I told him that I wasn't a "strange person", that I was just there to give the boys a hug and comfort them. 'To my surprise, I was practically thrown out.'
