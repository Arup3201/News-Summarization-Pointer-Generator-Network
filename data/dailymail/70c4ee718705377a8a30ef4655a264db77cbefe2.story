A mother-of-11 who claims £38,000 a year in benefits  has announced she is pregnant with her twelfth child - a baby girl.

Cheryl Prudham, 32, from Gravesend, Kent, who claims the benefits through child allowances, tax credits and housing benefit with her husband Robert, 30, announced the latest news of her pregnancy on Facebook.

The Prudham's earn more than the Government's £26,000-a-year benefits cap because working as carers for 20 hours a week each allows them to claim tax credits.

She told her friends and family: 'I'm having a GIRL!!' which was greeted with congratulations.

She said her eighth girl will have a double-barrelled name, saying: 'I want a double barrel name, first name needs to begin with L like my Lexi-Rose, Lacey-May and Lainey-girl.'

She later said that due to the amount of children she already has, she has 'run out of ideas' for names.

Just hours after posting the news, she shared a scan of the baby with the caption 'my princess'.

Finally, she decided against the child's name beginning with 'L' and revealed she will call the baby 'Tillie-Grace'.

Mrs Prudham, who had twins in August, hit the headlines at the beginning of the year after posting a scan of her 12th child, before quickly saying it was a joke - but it wasn't.

She has previously claimed it is 'easy' to claim tens of thousands of pounds in benefits.

Mrs Prudham, who had her first son when she was 17 and living in a homeless hostel, says she is proud of having 11 children.

She has insisted she is not a 'lazy layabout' and says her husband also works.

She told Closer magazine: 'It's the Government's fault I've got so many kids. It's easy to claim benefits.

'I've always wanted a big family and being a mum is the best feeling in the world. We didn't rush into the decision to have more children lightly but we knew we'd be able to afford it.'

Mrs Prudham found out she was pregnant in October, just weeks after she had her twin daughters.

The couple, who live in a five-bedroom semi-detached council home both work 20 hours a week as carers for the elderly.

Mrs Prudham had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000.

She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight.

She then had three unplanned pregnancies; Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four.

In March 2009, she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three. 

They then had Lenny, now two, before she gave birth to daughter Lainey in January last year.

She then had twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose this autumn.

The mother-of-11 first attracted criticism after demanding her local council provide her with a bigger council house to give her growing family more space.

And as their family grew Mrs Prudham said publicly their benefits allowed to them to set aside thousands for foreign holidays and presents for their children.
