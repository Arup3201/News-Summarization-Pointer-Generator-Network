An elderly man who has raised pigs for 30 years has been seen riding his pig around streets and towns in China, after becoming too sick to walk.

The 68-year-old pig farmer from Chongqing in China rides a hog which weighs 250 kg and stands at about 3 feet tall.

He started riding it when an attack of bronchitis made him too sick to walk, which made him attempt to ride the pig.

The man has herded pigs for 30 years, and is commonly known as a 'swineherd', an older term for pig farmer that has disappeared into obscurity with the passing of time.

He was originally skeptical that his idea would pay off, but after giving it a go, he found that it was a lot smoother than he thought it would be.

After his realisation, he started riding the pig everywhere, from his house to market, to around the town.

After a nasty bout of bronchitis, the swineherd toyed with the idea of riding the pig, which turned out to be a much smoother ride than he thought it would be

The man and his hog have become a slight celebrity sight in the town of Chongqing in China

China is the world’s largest pork consumer and half of the world’s pigs – nearly 480 million – are kept there.

Last year the US’s largest pork producing company, Smithfields Farms, was bought by a Chinese company for £4.2billion.

Refuelling: The pig munches on some lettuce to get more energy to carry its rider a little further

The pig is so massive, weighing around 250 kg, that the riders feet don't even touch the ground when he travels on it

The man can be seen in all weathers, donning an umbrella when the weather would cause most to travel via car.

Thanks to the pig being a sustainable vehicle, all he needs to keep going is a little bit of fuel for the pig in the form of some lettuce or scraps.

A smooth ride: The pigs furry hide doubtless make it very comfortable, as the farmer raises a few eyebrows travelling down the roads

The pig is doubtless much cheaper than a car, as all it takes is some food rather than expensive petrol

This probably makes the pig far cheaper than a regular vehicle, and much more eco-friendly.

While the 68-year old is able to walk, he much prefers riding his hog around town.

The man seems incredibly jovial as he rides his pig, which has given him back the ability to travel around after his sickness

While the elderly man has recovered following his sickness and is able to walk short distances, he seems to much prefer using his pig to get around
