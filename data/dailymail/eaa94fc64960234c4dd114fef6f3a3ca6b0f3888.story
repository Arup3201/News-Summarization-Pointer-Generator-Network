Louis van Gaal gave Manchester United players the full hairdryer treatment during a stunning dressing room blast following their humiliating 5-3 defeat at Leicester.

Van Gaal was furious with his players for allowing a 3-1 lead to slip and led a fiery dressing room inquest with his players following the capitulation.

Van Gaal, who has a reputation for losing his temper with his players, was openly critical of his expensively constructed team after their second defeat in the Barclays Premier League.

United capitulated to a humbling loss to leave Van Gaal furious at his players for ‘giving the game away’.

Van Gaal’s team led 3-1 after an hour but crumbled defensively in the face of Leicester’s energetic attack to suffer defeat after leading by two goals for the first time in Premier League history – a run stretching 853 games.

Jamie Vardy, playing non-League football two years ago, terrorised United’s backline with his direct running and had a hand in all the goals, winning two penalties, and finishing calmly to put Nigel Pearson’s side 4-3 up.

A Leonardo Ulloa brace, David Nugent spot-kick and Esteban Cambiasso goal added to overturn strikes from Robin van Persie, Angel Di Maria and Ander Herrera as Leicester became only the sixth Premier League team to put five past a United side.

Van Gaal named Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Van Persie in the starting line-up but afterwards complained: ‘We have too many players who want to seek for the goal.’

The match turned on Mark Clattenburg’s decision to award a soft penalty in the 62nd minute for a push by Rafael on Vardy after the Leicester striker had shoved the Brazilian to the floor to win the ball.

Van Gaal declined to criticise the referee but added: ‘I am sitting on the fence. He was waiting for the push but it was stupid to do that. You know you are in the penalty area and you allow the referee to whistle if you make a challenge.’

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher was more forthright on Sky Sports, calling the decision from Clattenburg ‘shocking’. But he criticised United for splashing £150million in the transfer window without securing a ‘proper defender’.

‘Spending all that money and not bringing in a top defender is mismanagement at the end of the day,’ said the former Liverpool defender. ‘United look vulnerable like that at the back this season.’

Injury to Evans means he will miss the match against West Ham on Saturday. ‘Luke Shaw shall be fit enough to play so we can manage it but it is a thin defence,’ conceded Van Gaal.

Leicester now stand seventh in the table after a tough run of fixtures and Pearson said: ‘At 3-1 down I would have been happy to get anything out of it. It says a lot about character. I think we have a bit more quality than people may be aware of.’

Vardy added: ‘We knew their full backs would push up and leave a bit of space, which was easy enough for us to exploit when we got the ball and that’s exactly what we’ve done. Every chance has gone in the back of the net.’
