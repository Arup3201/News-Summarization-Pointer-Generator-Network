Everton football star and World Cup hopeful Ross Barkley has allegedly been threatened on Twitter by a convicted drug dealer and known gangster in a row over a girl.

Sam Walker, 30, sent a sinister message to 20-year-old Barkley saying: 'Inbox me a number for you ya little rat! You no wot this is about, so don't play stupid or your footie career will come to an end.'

The message is thought to have been sent after Barkley's ex-girlfriend started dating Walker.

According to the Mirror, Barkley and Walker have had 'discussions' in Liverpool nightclub Playground recently, a popular hangout for WAGs such as Abbey Clancey and Alex Gerrard.

Officers from Merseyside police confirmed they spoke to Barkley recently after he received a call from a 'third party' about a different threat, but the sportsman declined to make a complaint.

Ross Barkley is widely tipped to make the list for the tournament, taking place in Brazil this summer,after a stellar season with Everton.

Barkley has made 45 appearances for the club this season, scoring five goals.

That has helped the Toffees to fifth place in the Premier League, one point behind Arsenal, and within touching distance of Champions League football next season.

Walker, who was in court in February this year to admit a charge of possessing class A drugs, has previously been pictured smoking what appears to be a joint

Walker was previously jailed for being part of a gang dealing heroin and crack cocaine.

He served half of his four year, eight month sentence before being released on licence in 2012.

But he had his sentence extended last August when he admitted sending a threatening Â­voicemail to a police officer.

In February last year he was cleared at 
Sheffield crown court of being involved in a plan to smuggle drugs into 
Doncaster prison while an inmate there.

But he was back in court in February this year to plead guilty to possessing class A drug ecstasy, while denying another charge of carrying counterfeit currency.

In 2008, internet pictures of Walker in prison emerged, which showed him Â­apparently smoking a spliff.
