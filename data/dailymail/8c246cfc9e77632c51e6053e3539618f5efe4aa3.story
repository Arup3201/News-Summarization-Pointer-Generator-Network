Controversy: Bishop of Grantham Tim Ellis has expressed concern over such a lavish funeral for so divisive a figure as Baroness Thatcher

The bishop of Baroness Thatcher’s home town has joined her political opponents in questioning the cost of her funeral.

The Rt Rev Dr Tim Ellis, Bishop of Grantham, described the scale of the event as a ‘mistake’.

Yesterday, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander said he would prefer to see a simpler funeral, while former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott suggested the occasion should be privatised.

And Lord Ashdown, the Lib Dem elected leader of his party during Lady Thatcher’s final years in power, also said he would prefer something ‘more simple’.

Dr Ellis said the ceremonial event, costing up to £10million, was ‘asking for trouble’ amid divisions over the late prime minister’s legacy.

The Anglican bishop added: ‘I think that in a context where there is manifestly great ill-feeling about her tenure and about her legacy, to then actually have a situation where we seem to be expecting the nation to glorify that with a £10million funeral... I think any sensible person would say that that is asking for trouble.

‘It plays into the hands of  those more extreme people  who will use the funeral as an opportunity to promote certain political views. I think it was probably a mistake.’

But Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘He’s completely wrong and it seems particularly bizarre that of all the people to take this view, it’s the Bishop of Grantham.

He’s using his position in the Church of England to basically put forward his own political views.’

And Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘The arrangements for the funeral have been agreed by the Queen, who is the head of the Church of England. It is not for a bishop to call that into question.’

Meanwhile, Lord Prescott suggested the 13,000 millionaires who benefited from the Government’s cut in the top rate of tax should each contribute £770 to pay for it. ‘Privatise her funeral. It would be a fitting tribute,’ he added.

Mr Alexander called for a debate to be held over the appropriate arrangements for when a prime minister dies, and said: ‘I’m a Presbyterian, I would, by inclination, err towards something rather more simple than what we will see, but my sense is this is not the week to be having those discussions.’

Lord Ashdown said: ‘I have to say something just as solemn but a little more simple might be better.’
