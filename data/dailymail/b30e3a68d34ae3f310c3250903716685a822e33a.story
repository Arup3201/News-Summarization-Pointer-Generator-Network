Leslie Ammah shot his victim when he was stopped from chatting girls up

Â A bookmaker who shot a teenager in the stomach when he stopped him flirting with a group of young women was jailed for 12 years today.

Leslie Ammah, 23, flew into a rage when Ashley Toppin-Hector, 19, thwarted his efforts of chatting up fellow clubbers at a south London bar.

During the confrontation he pulled out a handgun and fired a single round at his victim's stomach.

Mr Toppin-Hector escaped serious injury after the weapon misfired and the bullet barely penetrated the skin and did not cause any internal injury.

Ammah, who was working as a William Hill cashier, was later identified thanks to his distinctive gold tooth and blue stripey top.

After an Old Bailey retrial he was cleared of attempted murder but convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.

Jailing him for 12 years, Judge Christopher Moss QC said: 'You have been found guilty of the sort of gangster-like criminal conduct that blights the streets of so many of our cities.

'It is people like you who make those streets so dangerous for law-abiding young people, often late at night.

'Young men like you should understand that if they carry a gun they are going to receive lengthy sentences.

'If they actually use that gun, the punishment is going to be more severe.'

Ammah had tried to befriend the group, who spurned his advances, and he became angry.

Mr Toppin-Hector and his group, who were leaving the South Beach bar in Brixton Hill at around 3.30am on September 3, 2011,  did their best to steer them away after two girls approached him and asked for a lift.

A group of up to eight men then approached the car and started a fight.

Prosecutor Paul Raudnitz said: 'They were accusing Mr Toppin-Hector and his friends of "c***-blocking", meaning preventing these boys from getting at the girls.

'A member of this larger group tried to grab Mr Toppin-Hector by the shoulder as the girls were getting into the car.

'Another male tried to hit Mr Toppin-Hector. There was an exchange of blows.

'One of the males had a small revolver in his hand and pointed that at Mr Toppin-Hector.'

The gunman fired the weapon and his group then ran off and fled in Ammah's Audi TT.

Mr Toppin-Hector was taken to hospital to have the .32 calibre bullet extracted from under the skin of his abdomen. He was discharged the following day.

Witnesses described the gunman as a 'dark-skinned black male, medium build, medium height, wearing a blue striped top'.

Mr Raudnitz said: 'He also had a gold tooth in the front of his mouth. It is the case for the Crown that this description fits the description of Leslie Ammah.'

Jonathan Akinsanya, defending, said that prior to his arrest Ammah had been working as a football coach for the Sports Fusion charity.

The gunman, of Stockwell, south London, denied grievous bodily harm but was convicted on these charges.

He was cleared of a more serious charge of attempted murder.
