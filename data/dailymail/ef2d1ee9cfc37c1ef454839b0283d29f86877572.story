A mother who was involved in a horrific car accident at the age of 14 which left her with 50 broken bones has turned her life around to become a spinning instructor.

Gemma Trotter was in a devastating road traffic accident while in Belgium with her family, leaving her with around 50 broken bones including three breaks in her neck, and her left leg completely destroyed. 

Gemma, now 31, was faced with the decision of being wheelchair bound with a lifeless leg, or getting it amputated and getting a prosthetic.

Determination: Gemma Trotter lost her leg in a horrific road accident when she was 14 but didn't let it ruin her life and has now become a spinning instructor

She decided to have an above-knee amputation just before her 16th birthday.

Making the decision was extremely tough. But Gemma was strong and didn't let her disability keep her down.

She refused to sit inside and mope, as she puts it, and she developed an interest in cars, car racing and, later, fitness.

She became a fully qualified fitness instructor and has been teaching for 11 years.

Gemma, who currently teaches a tough Les Mills spin-style class called, appropriately, Grit, said: 'I was inspired to teach because of not only my mixed experiences I’d faced from people not understanding my disability but also because I wanted to inspire other amputees to get involved in group fitness as I'd seen the benefits and confidence it had given me.

Inspirational: Gemma said she didn't want to sit around and mope about her disability so learnt a new skill and now wants to inspire others to do the same

Passion: After having an above-knee amputation aged 15, Gemma became a fully qualified fitness instructor and has been teaching for eleven years with a new-found passion for spinning

'In life, we always want to feel good about an achievement and this is no different for me.

I have to tailor so many aspects of my life and to have become a Les Mills instructor just like others had was a huge buzz for me.

'I feel like I’ve overcome another hurdle and now can give back to others.

'There aren’t many instructors who have to face the challenges I do. To become qualified was so hard.

'I had to stay so focused to keep practicing that it showed how much I really wanted it. It didn’t just fall into my lap.'

One of the classes Gemma teaches is a fast-paced spin session called RPM that burns 675 calories in 45 minutes.

And Gemma says that a lot of the class attendees are shocked when they first see that their instructor is missing a leg.

Sometimes those attending the class even mistake her for a nervous novice.

She said: 'I always wonder how the participants will react to me walking in.

Turned her life around: After breaking around fifty bones in her body, Gemma was determined to recover and has now developed a talent for spinning

'I have been asked before: "Have you ever done this with your leg?", before having to explain that I am the instructor and not just a beginner with a false leg.'

Gemma, who is married with children, says she always tries to see the positive in life.

She explained: 'I embrace being an amputee. Once I had made the decision to have my leg cut off, there was no going back. If you don’t embrace the hand you’ve been dealt then you will always struggle to enjoy life.

'I have a lot to be grateful for and I don’t ever take for granted the ability to walk. I love the fact that I can do so much, but know that a lot of the achievements I’ve made are through sustained effort.

'Keeping as fit and healthy as I can has really helped my recovery.

Moving on: Despite setbacks in life, Gemma embraces all she has; she is now married, with children and tries to see the positive in life

'I haven’t ever achieved anything through moping about or sitting around moaning - that’s for sure!'

Gemma is keen to raise awareness and wants her success to inspire others with disabilities to get out there.

She said: 'I would love other instructors to be more aware of the capabilities of people with disabilities.

'It didn’t happen overnight but over years I was then able to execute the movements as good as able bodied people.

'Never give up if the going gets tough because this is just adaptation and your body will become stronger. Some encouragement goes a long way.'

When asked is if she would ever consider training to enter the Paralympics, Gemma said: 'It's a tricky one for me, because I know that if I entered 
the Paralympics I would be accepted as there are hardly any female 
competitors.

'I made the choice the steer away from that path because I 
want what I do to be relatable to everybody at a grassroots level.

'Anybody can come to my classes, whereas not everybody gets the chance to
go to the Paralympics.'
