Sing up, Chelsea fans. You've never had it so good.

That's essentially what Jose Mourinho was intimating to the Blues faithful when he complained about the noise levels at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

As Mourinho's side maintained their unbeaten start to the season against west London rivals QPR, no less, the atmosphere at the Bridge was tepid, to say the least.

Chelsea fans will argue that the Shed End is always rocking when the big boys come to town, but shouldn't it be every week?

Here, MailOnline Sport lists 10 reasons why Chelsea fans should crank up the volume...

Jose Mourinho takes his place in the Chelsea dugout ahead of his side's 2-1 win over QPR on Saturday

1) 'Jose Mourinho'

As the song goes... After years of hiring and firing, Roman Abramovich finally came to his senses last year, made up with the Special One, flung open the Stamford Bridge gates and sparked a nostalgic Chelsea love-in. A year or so on and that honeymoon period seems to be over. He may just be plain old Jose again but the enigmatic Portuguese is beginning to flex his managerial muscles after an ultimately disappointing first season back. Oh, and he's not Rafa Benitez.

2) It's just like watching Brazil

Well, not the Brazil we saw crumble at the last World Cup, but Chelsea's football this season has been sublime at times. The hallmarks of Mourinho's first Chelsea side, who won back-to-back titles in 2005 and 2006, were organisation and relentless consistency. But Jose's Chelsea Mark II have been slick and quick. Enough to make you stand up and sing, you'd think.

3) Champions elect

On the evidence of the first 10 games of the season you'd be mad to back anyone other than Chelsea for the title. Manchester City and Arsenal are dropping points left, right and centre, Liverpool are a shadow of the side that came so close to glory last year and Manchester United are even worse off at this stage of the season under Louis van Gaal than they were under David Moyes 12 months ago.

4) Drogba is back

In a decade of unprecedented success Didier Drogba was the man who got the goals that won the trophies for Chelsea. Who could forget that night in Munich? And those Wembley heroics? But after a hero's welcome back in the summer, Drogba has quickly been forgotten about. Yes, he's not had many minutes, but he was never going to at his age. The feelgood factor Drogba's return brought with him has died down alarmingly quickly.

The hype surrounding Didier Drogba's return to Stamford Bridge has quickly dissipated 

5) That midfield

It cost Chelsea over £70million to unite Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Oscar in the middle of the park but it's already looking like a snip. Aged 27, 26 and 23 respectively, the trio should have several years together to work on what is already a seamless combination of steel, energy and style. Chuck in Eden Hazard and Willian or Andre Schurrle on the wings and you've got enough to make most football fans audibly purr.

6) Deadly Diego

Perceived wisdom has it that Chelsea would have won the title last year with a decent striker in their side, and they probably will do this time around thanks to one that's more than decent. Diego Costa is the sort of striker fans love: full of passion, wild celebrations and, most importantly, goals. There are 19 other Premier League clubs that would love to have him in their side, but poor Diego hasn't even got a song at Chelsea yet...

7) Kings of Europe?

Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are the teams to beat in Europe this season but Chelsea look the most capable of any side in the Champions League of doing just that. This is arguably the best starting line-up and squad the Blues have ever had to combine a Premier League title challenge with an assault on Europe. They're certainly the best-equipped English side to triumph in Europe.

8) Roman's Empire

Eleven years on and for all his mystery, Roman Abramovich appears to still have all the same enthusiasm for his plaything as he did when he first bought the club from Ken Bates. Remember him, anyone?

9) Home comforts

Abramovich has been exploring options to expand or move from Stamford Bridge over the past decade, but at least it has four stands and, well, works. Those Blues who have been around longer than the Abramovich era will remember Stamford Bridge with a dirt track around it, cars parked just yards from the pitch and a stand with no roof.

10) You've never had it so good

Many a Chelsea fan will only know success. The last 10 years have been laden with it: three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups, one Champions League and one Europa League. Not bad. But it was once all so different. Chelsea were relegated to the old Second Division in 1988, and until Abramovich bought the club, their highest Premier League finish was third in 1999.

Time to shake off those Stamford Bridge blues. There's plenty to sing about after all.
