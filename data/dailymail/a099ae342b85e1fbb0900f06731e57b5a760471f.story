An American hate preacher has called for Al Qaeda terrorists to launch attacks on Western diplomats and praised the murder of the U.S. ambassador to Libya.

Adam Gadahn, who was born in California but converted to Islam and became a wanted jihadist, urged wealthy Muslims to dole out rewards for killing other Western ambassadors.

The 34-year-old's chilling message comes after Western embassies across the Muslim world were shut down earlier this month after warnings of an imminent terror attack.

Threat: Adam Gadahn has called on Al Qaeda terrorists to launch attacks on Western diplomats

Gadahn issued his call for violence in a 39-minute video in Arabic, according to SITE, a group which monitors Islamic extremists.

He pointed to the bounty placed on the head of the U.S. ambassador to Yemen, and asked rich jihadists to offer similar rewards for killing other senior diplomats.

'These prizes have a great effect in instilling fear in the hearts of our cowardly enemies,' Gadahn said.

'They also encourage hesitant individuals to carry out important and great deeds in the path of Allah.'

Gadahn, also known as 'Azzam al-Amriki', himself has a $1million bounty on his head promised by U.S. authorities.

Origins: Gadahn was raised in California but converted to Islam and became a jihadi extremist

Last year, the Yemen branch of Al Qaeda offered 3kg of gold to anyone who could kill the American ambassador to the country, or 5million rials (Â£15,000) for the death of a U.S. soldier.

Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, was killed last September when militants stormed the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

This is not the first time that Gadahn has called for attacks on Western diplomats - in 2007, he warned that Al Qaeda would target embassies in retaliation for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The FBI has been trying to question the militant, who is believed to be in Pakistan, since 2004.
