Chris Huhne has launched a scathing attack on the Tory hard right, bracketing them with the 'madcap' American Tea Party movement and warning they will 'wreck the nation's economy'.

The Energy Secretary used his speech to round on Conservatives who 'slaver over tax cuts for the rich' and claimed if they failed to compromise Britain's economic recovery would be 'put in peril'.

Mr Huhne's criticism is the most explicit verbal assault made from the conference platform by a senior Liberal Democrat on their coalition partners this week.

Verbal attack: Chris Huhne has bracketed the Tory hard right with the 'madcap' American Tea Party movement warning they will 'wreck the nation's economy'

He said: 'This coalition government saved Britain's credit standing by compromise.

'The danger if you don't compromise is now clear from America.

'There the markets looked over the brink when the mad-cap Republican right in Congress would not compromise with the President.

'Let that be a warning to the Conservative right here - we need no Tea Party Tendency in Britain.

'If you fail to compromise, if you fail to seek the common ground that unites us, if you insist that only you have the answers, if you keep beating the anti-European drum, if you slaver over tax cuts for the rich, then you will put in peril the most crucial achievement of this Government.

Vince Cable, left, and Nick Clegg, both made explosive comments at the party conference, where both made swipes about the Coalition partners

'You will wreck the nation's economy and common purpose.

'We are all in this together and we can't get out of it alone.'

He added: 'Whatever we think of the 
Conservative campaign in the alternative vote referendum, and I for one 
thought that the vilification of Nick was appalling, for Liberal 
Democrats compromise is not and cannot be a dirty word.'

In a direct challenge to eurosceptic 
Tories, Mr Huhne also vowed that the Lib Dems would not allow the 
Government to weaken links to Europe.

The Tea Party movement in the U.S exploded in reaction to Barack Obama's economic policies.

The anti-establishment grass-roots network is motivated by anger over the growth of government and budget-busting spending.

Although the organisation calls itself the Tea Party there is some dispute over the name's origin.

Some
insist it was drawn from the 1773 tax revolt known as the Boston Tea 
Party, others say it's an acronym for 'taxed enough 
already'.

In 1773, around 
200 colonists, furious that the English crown was demanding payment of 
duties on cargoes of tea in three British ships, stormed the vessels in 
Boston Harbour and threw the boxes of tea overboard.

The event protested what the colonists considered taxation without representation.

Earlier this month new intake 
Conservatives formed a group to press the case for repatriating some 
powers from Brussels and Foreign Secretary William Hague admitted looser
ties could benefit the UK.

Mr Huhne said: 'Being part of Europe is not a political choice. It is a geographical reality.

'It always was and until the tectonic plates break up, it always will be.

'We will not, as Liberal Democrats in government, weaken the ties that deliver our national interest through Europe.'

The Energy Secretary's criticism 
comes after a series of bruising comments made about their Coalition 
colleagues at the Liberal Democrat conference,

Vince
Cable and Nick Clegg made a series of vicious attacks on ‘childish’ 
senior Conservatives yesterday as they sought to distance the Liberal 
Democrats from their Coalition partners.

Business Secretary Mr Cable's provocative speech blasted the
Tories on tax, banking and their close relations with Rupert Murdoch.

The
Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader also used strong 
language to describe the Tories as he defended the right of senior Lib 
Dems to be ‘rude’ about them.

And party president Tim Farron has described Margaret Thatcher's years in office as 'brutal and appalling', according to the Huffington Post.

The strong words at the Birmingham conference signal that the Lib Dems are distancing themselves from their coalition partners.

Some fear that senior party figures 
are using the stage as a platform to present themselves as candidates in
a possible future leadership contest.

Mr Clegg has dismissed speculation 
that he might stand down in 2014 to become Britain's European 
Commissioner, the Independent reported, but some of his party believe 
that the option could remain open if the party's and his personal 
ratings are still poor.

Vince
Cable, Chris Huhne and Lib Dem President Tim Farron, have all been 
identified as potential successors to the Lib Dem part leader throne 
after their passionate speeches.

Mr
Farron's rabble-rousing speech, where he suggested that a 'divorce' 
from the Conservatives may happen before 2015, has led to some Lib Dem 
MPs suspecting him of throwing his hat into the ring.
