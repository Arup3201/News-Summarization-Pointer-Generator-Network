Danger threatens Manchester United in the discontent that is starting to build around the management of Louis van Gaal. The wheels of dissent are grinding audibly now and the noise may yet grow louder in March and April when United’s fixtures get tougher.

It is important that United hold their nerve and show resolve this time in a way they failed to do when David Moyes was buckling under the pressure of trying to keep the club in the bright light where Sir Alex Ferguson had camped them for more than 20 years.

Curing Manchester United is going to take time. The penny should have dropped by now that there is no quick fix, not even if you spend £150 million on new players in the summer. You need patience and you need a man like Van Gaal whose self-confidence knows no limits.

The first step towards rehabilitation and the return to greatness that United’s fans crave is to finish in the top four this season, but they are locked in an increasingly tense struggle with Southampton, Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool for the last two places.

It is possible they won’t make it and if that happens, strident voices will scream about the money Van Gaal has spent and the uninspiring football United have played and demand that he is sacked.

United’s performance in the victory over Burnley on Wednesday, as so often this season, was anxious and uncertain. Their defence seemed bewildered by the movement of Danny Ings. Their opponents were unlucky not to get more out of the game, another familiar trend under Van Gaal. United are not winning any friends with their style as they cling to third place, trailing in the wake of Chelsea and Manchester City.

But let’s get one thing straight: the very last thing that United should do in the summer, whether they make the top four or not, is to get rid of Van Gaal. It would not help their cause. In fact, it would deal a serious blow to their hopes of recovering their pre-eminence. It is not Van Gaal’s fault that United offered him the job knowing that he would not be able to start until last July because of his commitments with Holland.

It is not Van Gaal’s fault that the result was a late-summer super-market trolley dash that involved a panic signing like Radamel Falcao.

It is not his fault that Falcao has been a shadow of the predatory, prolific striker he once was.

Or that Robin van Persie is having another poor season.

Or that United have been struck down by an epidemic of injuries.

Or that a welter of expensive signings were rushed into the team and expected to adapt immediately to each other and to the English game.

Or that the club are so short of defenders he has had to play swathes of the season with novices like Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett.

Or that United had failed to fill the vacuum of authority in central midfield by the time he arrived and that, in the absence of the injured Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney has often been the only creative option.

None of it his fault. In fact, Van Gaal has done a remarkable job of husbanding his resources and keeping United in the top four. The club were right to sack Moyes, even if events have proved that those who believed the Scot was the reason for all United’s travails badly misread the scale of the rebuilding job Ferguson left behind. It was obvious by then, even to Moyes’s allies, that the job was too much for him, that he was paralysed by the scrutiny and the expectation that came with being in charge of one of the world’s biggest clubs.

Van Gaal wobbled last week, too. His ‘I have in my hand a piece of paper’ speech was fleetingly reminiscent of the wide-eyed territory Graham Taylor and Kevin Keegan have led us into in the past. But Van Gaal is made of sterner stuff. He will not disintegrate. For the most part, he has seemed utterly at ease with being boss and undaunted by the task of leading United back to the summit of English football. He does things his way, without regard for the court of public opinion. Whether that is playing three at the back or utilising Rooney in the centre of midfield, he is not swayed by the criticism of others.

This is a man, after all, who has managed Bayern Munich and Barcelona. He is no stranger to the heightened tensions being in charge at super-clubs bring. I interviewed him in the late Nineties when he was under siege at the Nou Camp. When I came out of his office, Catalan journalists were eager for any information I could give. Van Gaal was not talking to them.

Let’s not forget that even though he has been forced to blood Blackett and McNair, the back line has conceded fewer goals than anyone other than Chelsea and Southampton. It might not be sexy but it is progress.

Let’s also not forget that they finished seventh last season and were in disarray with a squad that looked threadbare. Morale was shot to pieces. Confidence was low. A raft of new signings was desperately needed.

Van Gaal's short stint at Old Trafford has already been an eventful one, but the club must stick with him

Under Van Gaal, United have  a habit of winning when not playing well and currently lie in third place

Van Gaal won the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 and   domestic titles in Holland, Germany and Spain

Despite their troubles, United lie third in the league

Things are better. Not spectacularly better. But they have improved. This may surprise you given the negativity that is being aimed at Van Gaal but over the last 15 Premier League games, United have won more points than anyone, with 34. Chelsea are next best with 33. As Van Gaal takes the flak, United are on a better run than anyone.

The club are moving in the right direction with a manager who knows what steps he has to make and is not overwhelmed by what lies ahead. If they stick with him, they will continue the journey back to the summit. If they don’t, United will be plunged back into chaos.

Time to ditch the greed

The Premier League have secured a new £5.1billion television deal and our great behemoth has grown even bigger.

For some, the deal has confirmed their view that English football represents all that is meretricious about our society.

Others suggest the country should be proud of the Premier League, as if it were a sister to the NHS or a brother to the works of Shakespeare.

I’m proud of it, I suppose. I’m proud of the football it produces and the entertainment it brings. And, yes, the joy the English take in sport and the loyalty we show in our support of sport have become things that help to define us.

Our modern football clubs also contribute much to their local communities: Manchester City’s regeneration of a hitherto neglected swathe of the eastern side of the city has brought new jobs and new facilities for local people.

Manchester City spent £200m regenerating a dilapidated part of the city to build a stunning training complex

The new television deal will see over £5bn pumped into the national game, but clubs must show benevolence

But I would be more proud of the Premier League if our elite football clubs called a halt to the relentless disenfranchisement of their traditional fan-base. I would be more proud if our elite clubs now used their vast wealth to reduce ticket prices.

I would be more proud if they increased the subsidy they pay to lower league clubs, which are so important to the fabric of the game in this country.

I would be more proud if they improved their commitment to developing more grass-roots facilities. They have it in their power to become enlightened despots.

They are businesses, not charities, but they have the best chance they will ever have to choose benevolence, not greed.

The sacking of Paul Lambert as the manager of Aston Villa last week was a classic of its kind. The owner starves the club of investment, results suffer, unrest grows, the fans criticise the owner, the owner doesn’t like the heat, the owner sacks the manager. It’s football’s favourite formula.

There is a poignancy about the accelerating decline of Tiger Woods that will survive the fact he often wore the mantle of his hegemony without charm or grace. Woods’ curse is this: he is one of the greatest sportsmen there has ever been and yet his epitaph will be that in the chase to overhaul the record of 18 Major victories set by Jack Nicklaus, he fell short.
