Marybeth Rataic who is accused of having sex with her friend's 10-year-old son while babysitting him and his siblings 

A babysitter has been accused of repeatedly having sex with her friend's 10-year-old son while she was looking after him and his other siblings.

Marybeth Rataic is facing 10 felony charges after allegedly having sex three times with the boy at his home in Meriden, Connecticut.

Police say that in one instance, the 25-year-old from Willimantic, had sex with the boy while his siblings slept in the room after creeping into the child's room, which he shared with his brothers.

She is also accused of having sex with the 10-year-old while his mother was giving birth in hospital.

Another encounter is also said to have taken place after Rataic went to buy drugs, her arrest warrant says.

According to NBC Connecticut, suspicions arose when the boy's mother noticed he had a love bite on his neck.

He then told her that that he had sex with Rataic at least three times between August 19 and 23.

Rataic, herself a mother to a nine-month-old baby, denies the allegations that she sexually abused the boy saying that he forced himself upon her.

It is reported that she said she tried to stop the child by pushing him away.

The Record Journal reports that she didn't tell anybody about the incident because she was too 'embarrassed'.

Ashley Elliot, who lives in the same apartment building as Rataic and is friends with her told NBC she is still concerned about the child even after everything that went on.

Rataic was arraigned at Meriden Superior Court, pictured, and is facing 10 felony charges 

She added: 'Emotionally, she's torn apart.'

Rataic was arraigned at Meriden Superior Court after being charged with three counts of first-degree sexual assault and seven counts of risk of injury to a minor/impairing the morals of children.

She is now being held on a $150,000 bond is due to appear at New Haven Superior Court later this month.
