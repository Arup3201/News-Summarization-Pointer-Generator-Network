Defying her terminal illness, an inspirational and selfless nine-year-old girl has helped to raise nearly a quarter of a million dollars so that 36 other children can have their wish come true.

Even though little Gabriella Miller is undergoing grueling chemotherapy and radiation treatments for her inoperable brain tumor, she couldn't stop thinking how lucky she was to be going to Paris through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Determined to help other children have their last wish granted, the Lessburg, Virginia resident decided to spread her own personal motto, 'you might have a bad day today but there's always a bright star to look forward to tomorrow, what's your bright star?'

Little Gabriella Miller inspired a charity drive to have letters sent to Macy's so that they would donate money to the Make-A-Wish Foundation

Diagnosed only last month, Gabriella is looking forward to a dream visit to Paris soon - but thinking of others and not herself, she wanted to let as many children as possible experience the same good fortune as her.

Her mother told her about Macy's 'Believe' campaign, in which the retail giant donates one dollar to the Make-A-Wish Foundation for every hand written letter it receives to Santa.

Contacting Chris Croll, a family friend and charity worker, a social media campaign was begun on Facebook that spread at an astonishing rate around the Internet and smashed through Gabriella's goal to get 10,000 letters sent to Macy's.

The letter's came from as far away as Saudi Arabia - all arriving at a special center set up by Croll in Leesburg.

They doubled that number within the first ten days and just before Christmas Day, a spectacular 240,983 letters had been sent by children inspired to believe in Father Christmas.

In addition to the near $250,000 that they will now donate to the noted children's charity, Macy's will be giving an additional $25,000 in honor of Gabriella.

The happy-go-lucky Virginian fourth grader was diagnosed with her rare and aggressive cancer three days before Thanksgiving but the brave girl began her amazing charity quest after telling her parents, Mark and Ellyn Miller that she doesn't like to 'get' without giving something back.

Gabriella's campaign resulted in enough funding to pay for 36 more wishes to be granted to seriously ill children.

The ambitious girl announced her astounding target at Macy's Dulles Town Center mall on the 23rd of December and brought tears to the crowd with her candid speech.

The letters arrived by the bag to the center in Leesburg Virginia which was set up to deal with the influx after Gabriella's campaign was put onto the Internet

'Dear Santa, I'm Gabriella, the one with the tumor. Make A Wish has really touched me,' said Gabriella as she clutched a microphone.

'I want to say one more thing,' she added during her speech.

'This is my motto and I think you should use it too. You might have a bad day today, but there's always a bright star to look forward to tomorrow.

'Look inside what's your bright star. Thank you. happy holidays.'

The generosity of the children has inspired and helped Gabriella through her arduous treatment and led to some touching letters to Santa with Christmas wishes.

'Dear Santa, I have everything I need, just please cure cancer for Christmas,' is one letter that Croll says she has received.

Touching: This letter asks for Santa Claus to find a cure for cancer for all the sick people and for girls to stop loving 1 Direction and to stop talking about them

This letter claims to not ask for much for Christmas from Santa - but it still got Macy's to donate $1 to charity to help sick children

Mom Ellyn was touched too by the thoughtfulness of the children.

'Just the sweetness and the innocent of these children writing something down,' said Ellyn.'It was not about Santa Per se, it was about expressing their needs and their desires and their wishes.

'Whatever holiday it is that you celebrate it's just goodness and pure and what can we do to be kind to other people.'

The family hope that the treatment that Gabriella is receiving will shrink and destroy the tumorl, which is the size of a walnut.

One night recently, Gabriella's father Mark took the family out to buy a packet of walnuts which they lined up in the deck railing outside and together they smashed them with a frying pan and hammer.

'Gabriella’s tumor is pressing on some of her facial nerves, which makes it difficult for her to smile — but she still lights up the room wherever she goes,' Croll said to the Washington Post.

The family hope to travel to Paris in the spring and when they do they hope to have heard from some of the families that they have helped see their wish come true.
