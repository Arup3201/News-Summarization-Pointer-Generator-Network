Parents must do more to teach their children right from wrong to stop them becoming criminals, the police watchdog said yesterday.

In his first major speech as Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Tom Winsor said it was the duty of all parents and families to turn young people into law-abiding citizens.

He also accused mental health services of abdicating their duty to prevent crime, and warned that officers were frustrated with the soft sentences handed out to the criminals they catch.

One the beat: Police watchdog Tom Winsor called for better-targeted patrols to 'disrupt and destroy' opportunities to offend, instead of waiting for crimes to happen

And he urged for persistent and dangerous offenders to be put in prison to prevent them committing further crimes.

Speaking at the Royal United Services 
Institute think-tank  in Whitehall, Central London, Mr Winsor said: 
‘Parents and families as well as schools must instil  in children a 
strong appreciation of right and wrong and  the reality and instincts to
behave as responsible law abiding citizens.’

Asked about tackling persistent 
criminals, he said that officers must ‘make it as hard as possible to 
commit the crime in the first place’.

He added: ‘Many many police officers are extremely frustrated at the sentences that are sometimes handed out by the courts.’

He said officers must find ‘persistent prolific and dangerous offenders and take them off the streets’.

Mr Winsor argues that money can be saved if crimes can be prevented, eradicating the cost of dealing with offenders in the criminal justice system

‘If you have them locked up that’s a 
pretty good way of preventing crime,’ he added. Mr Winsor warned that 
officers were often left to deal with criminals with mental health 
problems because the police were regarded as the public service that 
would ‘never say no’.

As a result, officers’ time was wasted looking after people who should be in the hands of mental health professionals.

Mr Winsor, the former rail regulator, 
also complained that police were working with primitive equipment that 
was ‘next to useless’.

A modern version of the Tardis police box, made famous by Doctor Who, could be used as a base for patrolling officers, the Policy Exchange think tank said

On a visit to meet officers on the front line, he found one using a personal electronic organiser that was a decade out of date.

He said officers were often putting 
technology such as iPhones in their lockers at the start of their shifts
and taking out far inferior equipment to use on the job.

Beat officers should have access to 
intelligence and other databases while on the beat so they know the 
background of the addresses and streets they patrol.

He added: ‘In too many respects, the technology which officers have to work with is quite far behind where it could be.

‘It is remarkable that the technology 
available to the police, particularly in their interaction with other 
parts of the criminal justice system, is as rudimentary and as primitive
as it is. It haemorrhages efficiency.’

Mr Winsor was the first non-police officer appointed Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

He was selected seven months ago after
writing two controversial reports for the Home Office into the pay, 
conditions and structure of policing.
