Part of the reason we started our blog, A Style Album, was to experiment more with our style and to banish the fears so often associated with fashion.

From the catwalk models walking the runway to the immaculate looking celebrities sitting front row, we know that fashion can be intimidating. 

However, we want to simplify fashion for you and help you find your style. 

Whether that means digging something old out of your wardrobe and starting to wear it again or  picking a colour that you wouldn't normally wear next time you hit the shops, we are here to help and share our top tips for pulling off the look.

Louise Redknapp, left, and Emma Thatcher, right, are FEMAIL's resident style bloggers and this week they're showing us how to work the bright colour trend

We've definitely helped each other when it comes to style and give each other the confidence to try something new. 

When it comes to our personal look, we massively rely on street style inspiration for our every day looks.

We might have an item in our wardrobes that we've bought and love but never worn, then we see a picture of someone wearing something similar and instantly get the inspiration and the confidence to wear it. 

We all know what it's like to wake up in the morning and have no clue what to wear even though we have a wardrobe full of perfectly good clothes.

We both take a huge interest in wearable fashion and hope to help you get reinspired with your wardrobe and what better way to start than with a bit of colour! 

During the dreary winter months a bit of colour can really lighten your mood; it's an instant pick-me-up.

Blacks, greys and nudes can actually be quite draining but a simple pop of colour can really transform and lift your skin tone. Plus, wearing a colour that suits you can lead to plenty of compliments on how well you look; so be bold and brave and embrace the colour! 

The stylish pair loved the bold sundress that Naomi Campbell wore in the Diane Von Furstenberg SS15 show

We saw plenty of colour on the SS15 catwalks, especially psychedelic and rainbow style. Diane Von Furstenberg had Naomi walk in the most gorgeous of sundresses from a strong, bright summer collection.

D Squared gave a great example of the rainbow trend, which we'll definitely be taking inspiration from come spring.

The Duchess of Cambridge's favourite designer, Roksanda Ilincic, usually plays with colour blocking and didn't disappoint this season. And it seems that the celebrities took note of the catwalk's coolest trends.

Solange Knowles is someone we can always rely on to look bright and beautiful, while Laura Bailey and Poppy Delevigne never shy away from colour. 

Models Jourdan Dunn (left) and Poppy Delevingne (right)  are never ones to shy away from colour often opting for bright and bold prints

Sienna Miller has made quite a style comeback of late and has been experimenting with colour, while Jourdan Dunn gave a lesson in winter colour dressing with her vibrant trench at the Burberry show.

Brands that are consistent time and time again with bringing us brights are J Crew (whose creative director Jenna Lyons is queen of the colour clash), and Alice & Olivia. Of course where the designers lead, the high street will follow so look our for brights dropping in stores now. French Connection always has great options of block colours and we love H&M for colourful prints.

Until next time,
