Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman said he has tried cannabis in the past

An anti-drugs politician admitted yesterday he used to smoke marijuana.

Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman said he used cannabis when he was younger but now tries to educate children on the dangers of drug use. 

In 1996, Portman founded the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati after 16-year-old Jeff Gardner died from huffing gasoline and smoking marijuana.

When asked whether he had ever taken the drug, Portman told Buzzfeed: 'Uhh... yes. I think I've been asked that now, in 20 years, three times.

'I'm very involved, as you may know, on drug prevention. I have been since my first year in Congress.'

Previously, the Senator said he did not buy or sell the drug and rarely smoked it.

He started actively campaigning against drug use when he returned to Ohio in 1996 after a stint as President George Bush Snr's deputy assistant and director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs.

Portman founded the coalition in 1996 and it has since promoted drug-free environments for young people through education.

He previously said of the organisation: 'I decided we could not afford to wait for another tragedy to prompt us to take action.

Bill Clinton, pictured left with George Bush Snr, said he smoked cannabis as a student but 'did not inhale'

'Our aim is to develop and implement a comprehensive, community-based strategy to reduce drug abuse in our region.'

Portman joins two Presidents who have admitted to smoking marijuana.

President Barack Obama admitted using the drug as a teenager in his 1995 autobiography, Dreams From My Father.

He wrote about some of his smoking haunts, including 'a white classmate’s sparkling new van', 'in the dorm room of some brother' and 'on the beach with a couple of Hawaiian kids'.

In his memoir, Dreams Of My Father, Barack Obama said he smoked cannabis when he was a teenager

'Pot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it,' he adds in the memoir.

Bill Clinton famously admitted smoking marijuana but 'not inhaling' while a studying at university in England.

While Governor of Arkansas, he said: 'When I was in England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and didn't like it. I didn't inhale and I didn't try it again.'
