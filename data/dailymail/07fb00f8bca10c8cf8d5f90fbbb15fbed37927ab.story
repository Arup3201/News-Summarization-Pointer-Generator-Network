Snuggled up together and almost holding hands in their sleep, this is the heart-warming moment twin baby girls were reunited after spending their first six weeks apart as they battled for life.

Darcey and Eden Mold, who were born six weeks premature and with holes in their hearts, were immediately placed in separate incubators.

Weighing just 4lb 13oz each, they were wired up to a tangle of bleeping monitors, tubes and drips.

After weeks of complications and treatments in hospital, the twins were finally well enough to go home and have their first cuddle in a Moses basket, dressed in matching pink sleep suits.

Katy Mold, 31, gave birth to twin girls Darcey and Eden (pictured) after going into labour at the 34-week stage of her pregnancy and both girls were born with holes in their hearts - known as congenital heart defects

Parents Katy (pictured left with the twin girls) and David Mold (right), from Sway, Hampshire, have been in and out of Southampton General Hospital after both girls fell unwell after the birth and needed urgent care

Their mother Katy, 31, said yesterday: 'They're both little fighters. They really are both little miracles.'

The twins were born just one minute apart in an emergency Caesarean on November 25, after Mrs Mold's waters broke 34 weeks into pregnancy when she choked on a crisp.

Eden, who was born second, was immediately whisked away for checks and medication as she had large holes in her heart.

Mrs Mold, who was wheeled in her hospital bed to visit the pair in intensive care nine hours after their birth, said: 'Just seeing them so small and so helpless, it was very hard. I couldn't hold them.

Mrs Mold gave birth after her waters broke when she choked on a crisp. The girls weighed just 4lbs and 13oz when they were born (pictured) and while Darcey was allowed home straight away, Eden was kept in hospital

As well as being born with large holes in her heart, baby Eden (pictured in hospital) also had a condition which meant she had a narrowing of the aorta and had no septum between the two ventricles of the heart

'Sitting around watching them in a box was the hardest thing.'

But this was only the start of an emotional roller coaster for Mrs Mold, a college secretary, and her husband David, 47, who runs an event management business.

When Eden was eight days old, she had to have a six-hour operation to repair narrowing of her aorta, the large blood vessel in the heart, and to have her pulmonary artery 'banded' to reduce blood flow to her lungs.

The operation was a success but days later Darcey, who had been allowed to go home because her heart condition was not life-threatening, turned blue and was rushed back to Southampton General Hospital where her sister was recovering.

While baby Darcey (pictured) was originally allowed home after birth, she was taken into intensive care just weeks later after being struck down with a severe case of bronchiolitis - a lower respiratory tract infection

Both Eden (left) and Darcey (right) spent six weeks apart while both were cared for on different wards at Southampton General Hospital. They have since been allowed home and are now three-months-old

The girls are pictured enjoying their first cuddle together at just five-days-old. They were later separated for six weeks while Eden received heart surgery and Darcey was cared for in intensive care for a chest infection

Diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a respiratory infection, Darcey spent 12 days sedated and ventilated and had to be given a blood transfusion.

Eden was finally well enough to go home on New Year's Eve and Darcey on January 2. They joined their sisters, Matilda, six, and Jemima, nine, at the family home in Sway, Hampshire. Now nearly four months old, the twins are both making a good recovery, although Eden faces further heart surgery this year, when surgeons will patch up the holes in her heart.

Mrs Mold said: 'I feel like I have been running on this rollercoaster of adrenaline ever since the birth ... I've been constantly on red alert, worried my children might die. I feel very lucky that both my girls are okay at the moment.'

She added: 'Everyone at the hospital was amazing.

'The care we've had has been second to none ... I'm glad they're both better and doing well, we couldn't be prouder.'

Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart.

The heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body.

The septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. However, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum.

A hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (VSD).

ASDs and VSDs allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. Thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. As a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body.

Children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. They can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired.

While the twins are now at home recuperating, Eden (right) will be taken back into hospital shortly to undergo further heart surgery. Doctors will continue to mend her heart using tissue from elsewhere in the organ

Darcey (left, top) and Eden are now being cared for at home by their parents and sisters Matilda (right top) and Jemima (right bottom). Father David said: 'They're both better and doing well, we couldn't be prouder'
