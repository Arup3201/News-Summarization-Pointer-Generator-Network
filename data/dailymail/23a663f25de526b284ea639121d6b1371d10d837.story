Relatives of a pastor's son accused of killing his parents and three siblings in New Mexico claim the teenager is not a 'monster' but a may have suffered a mental breakdown.

Nehemiah Griego, 15, allegedly used his father's .22 rifle and AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to shoot his sleeping mother Sara before killing his nine-year-old brother Zephania and two sisters, Jael, five, and Angelina, two.

It is claimed he then lay in wait at least four hours for his father, Greg, to return to the family home in a rural area southwest of downtown Albuquerque and then shot him dead late on Saturday night.

Police believe the video game-obsessed teen - who had allegedly spent a week plotting the murders - then spent the rest of the day at his local church.

But his uncle has claimed the teenager was a doting older brother who could not be responsible for the horrific killing spree.

Family murder: The shooting took place inside the Griego home, and Nehemiah waited there for hours after killing his mother and siblings until his father arrived home from work

House of guns: The boy allegedly used his father's .22 rifle and an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to shoot his family

In a statement he said: 'We have not been able to comprehend what led to this incredibly sad situation. However, we are deeply concerned about the portrayal in some media of Nehemiah as some kind of a monster.

'It is clear to those of us who know and love him that something went terribly wrong. Whether it was a mental breakdown or some deeper undiagnosed psychological issue, we can’t be sure yet.

'What we do know is that none of us, even in our wildest nightmare, could have imagined that he could do something like this.

'He is a troubled young man who made a terrible decision that will haunt him and his family forever.

'Five lives have been senselessly and needlessly ended. Ruining one more without trying to get to the bottom of what really happened and more importantly - why - would be equally tragic.'

It comes as police revealed that Griego spent the rest of day after the killings wandering the church grounds while Sunday school teachers were being trained on how to deal with a shooter.

The teen then allegedly told a pastor he had found his family dead in his home. 

Former police officer and Calvary Albuquerque security chief Vince Harrison, who was teaching the Sunday School security class, then took Griego to his house where he discovered the murdered family.

Religious: The boy's father, a former pastor, was thought to be working at a local mission at the time that his wife and three children were killed, and only returned home at around 5am when his son then allegedly shot him

He said: 'When I met Nehemiah, I knew something wasn't right. I could feel it, I could see it in his eyes and I could see it in his behavior and his demeanor so the red flags went up and that's when I called the sheriff's department.'

Harrison, who had known the Griego family for about 10 years, said he drove the teen back to the family's rural southwest Albuquerque home to meet authorities, interviewing him along the way.

'He went into detail of where they were, where the guns were and he was very matter-of-fact, really cold so I knew something wasn't right,' Harrison said.

After finding the bodies, sheriff's officials say, they took the teen to headquarters. During questioning, they say he confessed to shooting his mother and three younger siblings in their beds shortly after 1 am.

Investigators said he admitted he was 'frustrated' with his mother, but only seemed to show emotion when he spoke about video games he loved, such as Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto.

They say he then waited in a bathroom with a military-style semi-automatic rifle to ambush his father upon his return from an overnight shift at a homeless shelter.

He allegedly also told them he had reloaded the family's rifles and taken them with him in the family van with plans to randomly shoot more people.

Suspected shooter: Nehemiah Griego, 15, was said to regularly wear military camouflage gear around the neighborhood

'Quiet': Nehemiah was not registered with the school district so he was thought to be home schooled

'That sends chills down my spine,' Harrison said.

Harrison said several people spotted Griego at the church but thought nothing of it until his arrest. He said officials then reviewed security video and found the teen had spent much of the day there.

He said he doesn't know why Griego decided to come to the church, but that it was like a second home for the boy, who was schooled at his house.

'It was a familiar place to him,' Harrison said.

'I think if he did have in his mindset to do something foolish and start shooting people there also, I think his demeanor was tamed a little bit because he saw people there he knew.'

A prayer vigil was held at the church on Wednesday night for victims Greg Griego, 51, his wife, Sarah Griego, 40, and three of their children - a 9-year-old boy, Zephania Griego, and daughters Jael Griego, 5, and Angelina Griego, 2.

Before the start of the vigil, members of the crowd shared hugs and handshakes as photographs of the victims were displayed on large digital screens at the front of the church.

An estimated 2,000 people attended and nearly every seat was filled for the hour-long service.
