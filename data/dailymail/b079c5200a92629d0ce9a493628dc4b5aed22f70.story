People talk about a bird's-eye view, but one animal-lover was intrigued to see the world from a squirrel's perspective.

Attaching a piece of bread to a GoPro, Montreal resident David Freiheit wanted to see if an inquisitive creature would run off while the camera was recording.

But he got more than he bargained for when a  curious squirrel made off the with the camera. 

Scampering over to the GoPro from a nearby tree, the squirrel sniffs around for a few seconds before nudging the foreign object to try and see if it is a danger.

After deciding it poses no threat, the squirrel dashes off with the camera and runs straight up a tree - giving viewers a bumpy ride.

While inspecting its latest find, the squirrel inadvertently captures footage of Mr Freiheit waiting below the tree in the hope his camera will be returned.

Eventually, after deciding the GoPro isn't edible after all, the squirrel lets it drop to the floor and back into the hands of its rightful owner.

Luckily, as seen in the video, the camera wasn’t damaged in the drop. All it needed was a quick blow on the lens to clear away the dust and it was back in usable condition.
