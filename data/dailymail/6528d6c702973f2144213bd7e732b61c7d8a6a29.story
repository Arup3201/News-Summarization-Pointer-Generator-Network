One sophomore, named only as Holly, told the Orange County Register: 'I was in the class next door when I saw her students run out of the room with pale faces.

'Then teachers were running, then firefighters.'

Freshman Tessa Hoover, who was in the classroom next door, added: 'We didn't know what was happening.

'Our teacher ran out of our class, then into the room next door. Then she started screaming.

'Right away we knew something really horrible had happened.'

Assistant Superintendent Candy Plahy said the students who saw the hanging scene are being closely monitored and provided special counseling. Plahy said Mrs Jacobson's classroom is expected to remain closed for the rest of the year

She told the Register her digital media arts teacher returned and locked the door before they were ushered into the gym a few minutes later.

Frank Leon, 16, said his teacher left to unlock Mrs Jacobson's classroom and he heard 'screaming, crying,' he told the LA Times. 'It freaked the hell out of me.'

He added that his teacher was screaming 'Oh my God, oh my God!'

Captain Steve Concialdi, from the Orange County Fire Authority, said the teacher took her life sometime before 8.40am.

According to the police official, students who found the victim initially arrived to a locked classroom. 

After the two students were let inside by another teacher, the three found the teacher and helped cut her down from the ceiling.

Responding paramedics found her lying on the classroom floor suffering from cardiac arrest, and performed CPR but were unable to revive Mrs Jacobson. She was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Following the tragic event, many students have paid tribute to Mrs Jacobson on social media.

'We love you Mrs Jacobson,' wrote one student on Twitter. 'You'll never be forgotten.'

Another, Mitch Brick, posted a photo of a sunset as he wrote: 'Mrs Jacobson has taught me so much about photography, much love sent out to her, rest in peace.

'Mrs Jacobson told me that to be a good photographer, you need to get creative and think outside the box.' 

And Amber Guttilla said: 'For those who did not know Mrs Jacobson, there was not a teacher on this planet who cared more for her students.

'Her compassion knew no bounds and she always put us first. Please don't get caught up in the news stories that will only remember her for her final decision. You are so loved Mrs J.' 

Assistant Superintendent Candy Plahy said the students who saw the hanging scene are being closely monitored and provided special counseling.

'These are kids who were particularly close to this teacher,' said Plahy. 'Coming in and finding your teacher is no longer alive is traumatic. They need support.' 

Mrs Jacobson's classroom door was locked but a picture of the smiling brunette was placed out front along with notes and flowers.

Plahy said the classroom is expected to remain closed for the rest of the year.
