A fire at a transmitter site has affected television and radio broadcasts to 80,000 homes.

The fire service were called to the blaze at the site in Bathampton, near Bath in North Somerset, just before 6am today.

Crews put out the fire which is now believed to have been deliberately started.

Freeview television channels, BBC Radio Bristol, national analogue and digital radio channels were all disrupted.

Power was restored nine hours later after engineers had to switch off the power supply to the transmitter to assess the damage.

An Avon Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'This was a couple of sheds, or outbuildings, on fire, off Golf Course Road.

'We were called at around 5.45am and several appliances from Bath fire station are on the scene.

'I believe this may be affecting radio and possibly television transmissions in the area at the moment.

'Police have also been called as the early indications are that this fire may have been deliberately started.'

Customers getting TV via Sky were unaffected, as were people in the south of the city whose TV signal comes from the Mendip transmitter near Wells.

The transmitter - which also provides a mobile network service - is owned by the communications infrastructure and media services company Arqiva.

Arqiva later said the fire had officially been declared as arson.

A spokesman said there was fire damage to multiple feeders, which carry the digital signals between the antenna and transmitter.

'Electricity service is now restored and Arqiva engineers have been on site repairing the damage,' he said.

'Some radio services have been given a temporary feed to help restore the service quickly whilst repairs are undertaken.

'Television and national and some local radio stations are now fully back on air.

'Mobile network still has some disruption but engineers from both Arqiva and operators are working to repair damage.'

Avon and Somerset Police attended the site off Golf Course Road along 
with Avon Fire and Rescue crews after early indications suggested the 
fire was started deliberately.

'The site has been classified as a crime scene by local police who have sealed the site,' a spokesman said.
