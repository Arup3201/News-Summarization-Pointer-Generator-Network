For nearly two weeks, Robert Manning was sitting on a goldmine and didn't realize it.

The Virginia father recently cleaned out his wallet and checked his stack of Powerball tickets.

To his shock, one of the tickets he'd purchased at 7-Eleven at Rolling Rd, Springfield, on March 5 was worth $1 million.

Winner: Robert Manning had the winning Powerball ticket in his wallet for 11 days before he finally checked it

Lucky guy: Robert Manning said, with a child in college and another planning to go next year, the win has come at a good time

'It feels crazy,' he said, as lottery officials presented his winning ticket yesterday, NBC reported.

'It feels like there's nine million things going through my mind'.

Numbers from the ticket he bought  (3-7-9-26-54) matched the first five numbers for the drawing.

If the ticket matched the final Powerball number (19), the federal employee would have won the $40 million jackpot, officials told WUSA9.

Still amazing: If the final Powerball number on Manning's ticket match, he would have won $400m (his ticket not pictured)
