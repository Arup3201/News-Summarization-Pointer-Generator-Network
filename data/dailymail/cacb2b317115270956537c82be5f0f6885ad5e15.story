Hillary's hairstyles been such a hot topic over the years the former secretary of state and first lady says she nearly named her memoir in honor of her daring 'dos.

In the author's note of her upcoming memoir, Clinton playfully acknowledges the special place her hair holds in American history with a joke that she nearly called her book The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries And It’s Still All About The Hair.

'In the end, the title that best captured my experiences on the high wire of international diplomacy and my thoughts and feelings about what it will take to secure American leadership for the 21st century was Hard Choices,' Clinton writes.

These days Hillary Clinton wears her hair cropped short

As she was leaving the State Department in January of 2013, Clinton announced she would write a memoir about her experiences working in the Obama administration.

The Washington Post pounced on the news and held a reader contest to help Clinton come up with a name for her forthcoming manuscript.

Among the winners selected by WaPo were Stephanie Whittaker, director of marketing for a consulting firm in London, who suggested Hillary call her book The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It’s Still All About My Hair.

Other noteworthy entries to the contest were: If It’s 3 a.m., The Machine Can Get It, Stuck with Bill, Bossypantsuit, It Takes a World and Hard Times, Soft Power.

Still struggling for a title, Clinton lightheartedly told a group of publishers in a speech last March that she actually liked The Scrunchie Chronicles.

'That actually is a keeper. That’s on the shortlist,' Clinton teased.

Fashion faux pas: For years, Hillary Clinton's scrunchies have
 been the subject of gossip

Please, stop wearing scrunchies: Clinton's insistence on wearing scrunchies long after it was considered fashionably acceptable had State Department staff calling for a ban on scrunchies

Of all her hairstyles, Clinton's '90s era headbands and scrunchies have received the most attention.

Clinton's since shed the headbands, but has continued to wear scrunchies long after they were considered cool, leading a State Department official to tell Elle in 2012 that 'some' or her staff were trying to 'ban the scrunchies.'

The aide noted that Hillary often wore her hair up because, 'as a chick, it’s a big pain in the butt' to keep your hair looking fresh.

'The weather is different, and you’re in and out of the plane. [The staff] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready,' the aide said.

Clinton said she didn't care what people thought about her appearance when asked about the Elle article in a subsequent interview.

'I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now... and if others want to worry about it, I let them do the worrying for a change,' she said.

'Because you know, if I want to wear my glasses I'm 
wearing my glasses. If I want to wear my hair back I'm pulling my hair 
back.'

Done caring: In response to staff's attempts to ban her scrunchies, Clinton, pictured here sans scrunchie in 2013, said she was at the point in her life that 'if I want to wear my glasses I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to wear my hair back I'm pulling my hair back.'

In the end, Clinton tossed aside The Scrunchie Chronicles and went with another suggestion from WaPo's list for her book title - Hard Choices, which was suggested to the Washington Post by retired New York Times reporter Alfred Friendly Jr.

Publishing group Simon & Schuster told Politico that it has already sold 1 
million copies of the memoir, and another 1 million copies will hit shelves when the book drops 
on June 10.

The memoir will detail President Barack Obama and other 
world leaders' difficult decisions as well as Clinton's own during her 
time as secretary of state, according to the author's note, released by 
the book's publishing group today.

'As is usually the case with the benefit of hindsight, I wish we could go back and revisit certain choices,' Clinton explains at the start of the book. 'But I’m proud of what we accomplished.'
