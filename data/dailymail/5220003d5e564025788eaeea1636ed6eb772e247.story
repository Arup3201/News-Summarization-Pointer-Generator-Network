Walsall will play at Wembley for the first time in their history after reaching the Johnstone's Paints Trophy final after a 0-0 draw sealed a 2-0 aggregate win over Preston in the northern area final. 

Late goals from Anthony Forde and Tom Bradshaw secured Walsall a two-goal cushion in the first leg of the tie. 

After 90 tense minutes of football, the Saddlers hung on to secure their place at Wembley.

'It's an amazing achievement to be the first Walsall manager in 127 years to take his team to Wembley, said manager Dean Smith. 'Especially when I think of the calibre of some of the mangers who have been here before me and I feel very proud.

'It was a very scrappy game, but then I always thought it would be and it turned out that the two-goal cushion we got up there was enough.' 

There are now just three Football League clubs who have never played at Wembley — Accrington, Hartlepool and Crawley Town. Walsall will face either Bristol City or Gillingham.
