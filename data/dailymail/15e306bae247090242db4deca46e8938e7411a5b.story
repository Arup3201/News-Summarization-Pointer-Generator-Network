From a 62-year-old pole dancer to a club DJ in her 70s, a new book hopes to change our ideas about what life is like after 70, 80, 90 or even 100.

Photojournalist Vladimir Yakovlev, from Russia, travelled the world for two years searching for people who've discovered new hobbies and pleasure in their old age for his book The Age Of Happiness.

The international project aims to alter our perception of life after retirement with pictures of inspirational pensioners like incredible Greta Pontarelli who has the body and flexibility of a young gymnast after taking up pole dancing to treat her osteoporosis.

Greta Pontarelli, 62, turned to pole dancing as she needed to do strenuous exercise after she was diagnosed with bone disease osteoporosis

Greta, from California, started pole dancing two years ago, after she was advised to take up something to strengthen her bones. She needed something that would involve lifting weights but more fun. She said: 'Weight-lifting is very boring. That's why I looked into pole dancing'

Greta Pontarelli, 62, from California, stays active by pole dancing after discovering at 59 that she had the fragile bone disease osteoporosis.

She sad: 'To strengthen my bones, I needed strenuous exercise, something that would involve lifting weights. But just weight-lifting is very boring. That's why I looked into pole dancing.'

She now competes internationally, showing off energetic moves and poses that would defeat most younger women.  

Among the photo subjects is Ruth Flowers, who decided to become a club DJ under the name Mamy Rock when she turned 68.

After losing her husband suddenly, who she had lived with for 40 years, she found she no longer wanted to stay in their home in a village in Portugal. Everything reminded her of her loss and she decided she had to try something new.

When she told friends she was set on becoming a DJ, they said her sorrow 'had driven her to madness'.

Magazine publisher Lloyd Kahn, 79, first tried skatebording at 65 when he fell and hurt his hand but now he always wears protective gear

After Yvonne Dowlen, 87, was injured in a car accident at the age of 80, doctors told her to stop skating but today she continues to compete

FIgure skater Yvonne said: 'If I ever get in a bad mood, I look at my peers with their oxygen bags, put on my skates and smile' 

When Yvonne Dowlen, from Colorado, US, was 80, she was in a car accident and was severely concussed. 

A doctor told her to hang her skates on a nail and consider her athletic career finished. But the former skating pro, who laced up her first pair of skates in 1939 when Franklin Roosevelt was in the White House, ignored his advice.

Today 86-year-old Yvonne goes out on to the ice just as before and participates in competitions. 

She said: 'When I’m in a bad mood, I look at my contemporaries with their oxygen pillows, put on my skates and smile.' 

Ruth, who died last year at the age of 73, couldn't understand why everyone was so convinced that older people are supposed to sit quietly at home and not dance at night clubs.

Over the  two years of her life, Ruth  performed over 80 times, playing at various clubs in London, Ibiza, Paris, New York, Los Angeles and even Tokyo.

Vladimir included 14 extraordinary characters in his book who enjoy each day and inspire others to make their lives equally fulfilling. After listening to their stories, he took photos of them enjoying their favourite activities or particular way of living.

Former Japanese POW John Lowe took up ballet when he turned 80. Now at 92, he dances professionally and enjoys performing on stage

John says that he dreamed about dancing his entire life. He rehearses at the theatre three times a week, and practices alone at home every day 

John Lowe, 95, from  Ely, Cambridgeshire, took up ballet at the age of 80.

The father-of-four and grandfather-of-11 survived being a prisoner of war in Japan during the Second World War and continues to inspire, practising dance at home every day in the makeshift dance at his home, which he created by putting down a wooden floor and installing a ballet bar along the wall.

He sometimes roller blades. 

When he turned 90 his family forbade him from leaping and turning 360 degrees in mid-air. 

Another star of the photoseries is 92-year-old John Lowe, who loves performing ballet. What makes John's story even more inspiring is that he only started when he was 80. 

John says that he dreamed about dancing his entire life. To stay in shape, John rehearses at the theatre three times a week, and on top of that, practices alone at home every day.

At 86, German gymnast Johanna Quaas, is as strong and flexible as a woman 70 years younger and she continues to compete

He even arranged a dance room in his home by putting down a wooden floor and installed a ballet bar along the wall. Sometimes, to shake things up, he roller blades.

When John Lowe turned 90, his family - four children and eleven grandchildren - forbade him from leaping and turning 360 degrees in mid-air.

'They are afraid that if I fall, they won't be able to put me back together, and, in a way, they are right,' he joked.  

Johanna Quaas, from Germany, appeared in her own gymnastics competition at the age of 11, but last year her improves moves found fame as videos of her training posted on YouTube went viral and generated three million views.

Several of the subjects featured in The Age Of Happiness Project are an inspirational reminder that activity does not need to stop once you've collected your bus pass.

Another Californian, 79-year-old Independent publisher Lloyd Kahn took up skateboarding at the age of 65. He stood up on a board, fell immediately, and hurt his hand. 

Since that  experience, he now wears full protective gear including knee pads, elbow pads and a helmet. 

He said:  'I don't do any special tricks. I don't ride like the teenagers. I try not to go too fast, so that I could always jump off and land on my feet.'
