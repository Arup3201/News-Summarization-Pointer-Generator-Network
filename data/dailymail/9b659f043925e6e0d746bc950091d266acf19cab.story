When she heard whimpering from a box in a rubbish tip, Kamila Musabekova thought it was a stray dog.

But the 69-year-old was horrified to find a newborn baby boy crammed inside.

Completely naked and covered in blood, medics claim the child can only have been hours old.

Abandoned: This baby boy was just hours old when he was left naked and covered in blood in a box in a tip

Horrified: Kamila Musabekova, 69, was shocked to discover a child when she thought she heard a dog whimpering

The mother-of-one wrapped the child in her scarf and rushed him to her home in Almaty, Kazakhstan, where she called a doctor.

She has now launched an urgent appeal to find the mother of the boy, who she has named Chingiz, meaning gift of God.

Ms Musabekova said she had decided to walk through the dump by chance on her way home from work.

'I usually walk along the road but I just wanted to take a shortcut simply because it was so cold,' she explained. 

By chance: She had walked through the dump in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on a whim on her way home from work

She heard a noise coming from this box and went to investigate, then found an hours-old baby

Saved: She took the box and wrapped the baby in a scarf, taking him home to a doctor

'I heard the noise and was convinced it was an abandoned puppy.

'When I open the box the was a tiny baby boy lying there naked, without even a blanket.

'The was blood on him and on the box because he obviously just been born.

'My heart went out to the little tyke. I 
am a mother myself and when I saw this little youngster I felt the same 
as when I first saw my own children after they were born.

Gift: Ms Musabekova has named the infant Chingiz meaning 'gift of God' and hopes to adopt him

Appeal: The mother-of-one says she will wait three months for the mother to come forward before adoption

Doctors told Ms Musabekova that Chingiz would not have survived for much longer if she hadn't found him

'I wrapped him in a scarf and rushed him home where I called the doctor.

'He told me that the baby was unharmed but that had he been left there very long he would not have survived.'

Desperate to ensure the little boy is given a good life, Ms Musabekova applied to adopt him, but was rejected because of her age.

She has now persuaded her son and his wife to file an application to bring the child into the family.

They will have to wait three months to give the biological mother a chance to come forward.
