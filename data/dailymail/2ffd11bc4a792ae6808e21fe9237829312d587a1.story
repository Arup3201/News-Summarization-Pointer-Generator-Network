Manchester City will listen to offers for defender Matija Nastasic as they pursue a £32million deal for Porto’s Eliaquim Mangala.

Nastasic, signed from Fiorentina for £12m in 2012, had an injury-hit second season at City and the 21-year-old could find himself as the club’s fourth-choice centre-back.

With Dedryck Boyata signing a new deal and teenager Karim Rekik returning after an impressive season on loan at PSV Eindhoven, City accept that Nastasic could be surplus to requirements.

For sale: Manchester City could be willing to listen to offers for defender Matija Nastasic

Struggle: Nastasic only played 13 Premier League games last season as he suffered with injuries

Incoming:Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala is expected to join City in the coming days

City captain Vincent Kompany remains first-choice at the club, while Martin Demichelis was part of the Argentina side that reached the 2014 World Cup final.

Joleon Lescott was released following the expiry of his contract and signed for West Brom.

Captain: Vincent Kompany's place as the leader of the City defence is assured

On standby: Martin Demichelis helped Argentina reach the 2014 World Cup final
