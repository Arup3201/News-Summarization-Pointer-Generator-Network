The $10million home recently bought by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is undergoing major renovations.

In the Dolores Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, CA., the home is slated for over $1 million in improvements, according to city building permit requests filed by a contractor.

The 5,542-square-foot, four-bedroom home was bought by Mr Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan last fall.

Close to the popular Dolores Park, the billionaire power couple’s home away from home is tucked neatly into the hilly neighbourhood on the edge of the Mission District, according to reports. The first family of Facebook also owns a mansion in suburban Palo Alto – near company headquarters.

First reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, the repairs aim to transform the house.

Additions to multiple floors, new windows, a new roof and custom landscaping are estimated to come in at a cool $750,000.

A first-floor office, media room, half bathroom, mud room, laundry room, wine room and wet bar are estimated to cost $720,000. That permit also details remodelling of the second, third and fourth floors, as well as a new bathroom on the second floor.

An overhauled kitchen and bathroom come to $65,000.

To nurture someone’s green thumb, a $60,000 greenhouse.

Finally, a new exterior wall and stairway, as well as further earthquake-proofing, are expected to tally about $30,000.

All added up, the initial estimate is about $1.6million, but those initial estimates often rise.

‘Workers at the site tell us they wouldn't be surprised if the final tab comes to several million more,’ said the Chronicle, adding the gut renovation will take about a year.

Stripped to the studs, the house’s garage is even getting an upgrade – with a turntable pad, the Chronicle reported.

Though not publicly discussed by the recently-married college sweethearts, the home’s new owners were confirmed to the newspaper by a local politician.

Supervisor Scott Weiner leaked to the paper his knowledge of the home’s buyers, but lamented not running into them yet.

The fixer-upper was ‘purchased through a holding company run by a lawyer who specializes in forming trusts for high-end clients,’ reported the Chronicle.

Spokespersons for both Zuckerberg and Facebook declined to comment to the Chronicle and could not be reached by MailOnline.
