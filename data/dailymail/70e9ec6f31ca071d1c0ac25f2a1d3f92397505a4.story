Toni Kroos has given the 
clearest hint yet that he is ready to quit Bayern Munich and move to the
 Premier League with Manchester United.

The
 Bayern star, regarded as one of the finest midfielders in world 
football, is locked in a contract dispute with the European champions.

Kroos, 24, has one year left on his deal at the Allianz Arena and is being courted by United manager David Moyes.

On Monday Kroos took the unusual step of taking Bayern’s media responsibilities ahead of the Champions League clash with Arsenal.

The German midfielder said: ‘It’s no secret, the Premier League is a possibility for me.

‘I’ve heard that people have written that I might go to  England. But there’s nothing new from my point of view.

‘No decision has been made. The 
situation is that I don’t have any agreement at the moment  at Bayern. 
On the other side there is no agreement in place anywhere.’

Kroos was outstanding in the centre for Bayern during the 2-0 victory at the Emirates in the first leg in London.

He
 has been flirting with the idea of a move to the Barclays Premier 
League after failing to reach an agreement over a new contract with the 
runaway Bundesliga leaders.

Although Bayern coach Pep Guardiola is 
confident that he can convince Kroos to remain in Munich, Manchester 
United are about to begin a massive overhaul of their squad.

Kroos 
would instantly become one of the top earners in English football — on 
around £250,000 a week — if he decided to move to Old Trafford.

Guardiola,
 who oversaw  Bayern’s staggering 6-1 victory at Wolfsburg on Saturday 
afternoon, appeared determined to keep one of the finest talents in 
German football.

The Bayern manager said: ‘Toni is a great talent, a
 good, good player. He’s young. He can be better and better. He can 
improve. I said to him, “you have time to become an even better player”.

‘I hope he maintains his form this season and for more seasons at this club.’

Moyes was in the stands at the Emirates to watch the Kroos masterclass.

Kroos
 scored the opening goal for last season’s Champions League winners and 
had more touches on the night than  Arsenal’s entire midfield put 
together.

He has been with the German giants since he was 16, but now wants pay parity with some of the top earners at the Allianz Arena.

Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben command the top  salaries at the club and Kroos is demanding a huge increase.
