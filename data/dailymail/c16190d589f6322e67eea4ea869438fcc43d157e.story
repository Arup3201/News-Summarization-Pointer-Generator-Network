It's a feast of epic proportions. 

Hungry sharks, dolphins, gannets and even a whale take part in a feeding frenzy of a staggering nine million sardines.

The huge cluster of sardines form a ball as a defence mechanism to try and look bigger but that doesn't stop the predators attacking them.

Dolphins take the opportunity for all-you-can eat buffet of sardines in The Wild Coast, on the East coast of South Africa

This gannet gets perilously close to a marauding shark, and appears to realise the danger nearby

A whale decided to get involved in the action, but there was enough food to go around for sure

Dolphins lead the hunt and attack first, causing the school of fish to split up - after it is a free for all between the sharks, gannets and whale.

The frenzy was 25 metres beneath the surface and lasted for over a staggering seven hours.

Wildlife photographer Michael Aw was underwater and managed to capture the spectacular feeding frenzy which took place in The Wild Coast, on the East coast of South Africa.

Michael, 59, who is from Sydney, Australia, said that seeing this mass feast, called the 'sardine run', was 'the greatest show on earth - the pinnacle of wildlife adventure.'

This shark must have thought all its dreams had come true as around nine million sardines swim past

Around 300 dusky sharks, bronze whale sharks and sand tiger sharks all got in on the action and were joined by 150 dolphins and 1000 gannets - as well as a Bryde's whale.

Michael, who photographs the sardine run every year, said: 'This is the greatest show on earth - the pinnacle of wildlife adventure.

'A scientist confirmed that there were nine million sardines in the huge ball, it was happening 25 metres below the surface.

'The dolphins break out a size-able chunk of sardines from the main shoal and chase it to near the surface.

'Then it is a free for all - the birds dived in, and then the sharks and whaled moved in to feast.

'The gannets, sharks and the whale are all opportunist feeders.

'The school of sardines were hurling away and forming a big ball to look bigger as a defence mechanism.

'I was there from 9am until 4pm and when I left, they were still feeding.

'Witnessing it was breathtaking - exhilarating - nothing can compare to it, it was the wildest of all wild moments.'
