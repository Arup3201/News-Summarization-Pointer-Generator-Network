Dressed in their best and posing for the camera they look for all the world like any other wealthy Edwardian family enjoying an English seaside holiday.

These smiling pictures - forgotten for more than a century - offer an unusually relaxed insight into how a wealthy family once holidayed.

Doing away with the somewhat stilted, awkward pose usually adopted in family pictures at the time, George
and Theodora Hewitt and their three children, Doris, Cecil and Graily, 
are shown enjoying a family holiday like a great deal many others 
would have done, in the town of Sheringham, Norfolk.

Yet these images are particularly poignant, because they were taken by the sports-loving family's disabled son Cecil.

A set of touching family photographs taken in the early 1900s and showcasing the talent of a disabled photographer have been unearthed in a small museum

Cecil Hewitt took the photographs between the ages of 16 and 36 and died in Totnes, Devon, in 1947 aged 57

They catalogue the holidays of the wealthy Hewitt family from London. It is believed many were taken by Cecil Hewitt, one of the family's sons

While his family enjoyed the fashionable leisure pursuits of the era, Cecil, who suffered with an unrecorded condition, documented their life with his camera capturing the Hewitts 
relaxing on the beach, posing in front of a First World War pillbox and
taking part in fashionable leisure pursuits and games.

Amateur photographer Ron Wiebe found the slides stashed in shoeboxes in a cupboard at The Mo museum in Sheringham. 

Mr Wiebe said he believed the family 
gave Cecil the camera because his disability prevented him from taking 
part in so many other things.

He said: 'It was one of his few outlets.

'There
are a lot of photos of family parties and people standing on the 
croquet lawn and in front of the grass steps, which they seemed very 
proud of,' he said. 

'They always seemed to have a sporting implement in their hands and there are lots of photos of them having afternoon tea.'

Cecil Hewitt suffered from an unrecorded condition which resulted in him being shorter than average and meant that he needed metal calipers and a wheelchair. It is believed the sports mad family gave Cecil the camera because his disability prevented him from taking part in so many other things

Smart: The family and their friends are all impeccably dressed even as they relax on holiday

Fascinated by the images he discovered, Mr Wiebe has been scanning and cataloguing the collection and researching the Hewitt family pictured in the photographs.

Mr Wiebe said: 'There were nearly 1,200 images in the collection sitting in old shoe boxes.'Nothing had been done with them. 

'I looked at them and saw it was quite a treasure of photographs.

'As I started to photograph these things, I started to become interested in the people in them and started to do a bit of family history research.'

The family, lived a comfortable life in London.

Wealthy George Hewitt made his money selling horse medicine as a partner in a company which still exists today under the name Day, Son & Hewitt.

The pictures, taken between 1906 and 1926, show the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham where they had a holiday home

The seaside resort was an eighteenth-century invention.

Many doctors at the time prescribed 'sea air' for the sickly and disabled as an alternative to 'taking the cure' at a spa.

As a result, generations of holidaymakers, from the early Victorian age until the Thirties, saw England's seaside resorts flourish. 

Here was a place where holidaymakers and visitors could enjoy the beauty, the power and the much-touted healing properties of the sea, all from the safety of the sturdy pier.

During the great Victorian building boom, all seaside towns wanted a pier, and soon they had sprung up around the coastline.

Such was their popularity that by the turn of the century there were 90 piers around the country. 

The family built a holiday home they named East Court on the corner of Holt Road and Abbey Road in Sheringham in 1903, which has now been converted in to flats.

Cecil, who was born in 1890, suffered from an unknown disability which resulted in him being shorter than average and meant that he needed metal calipers and a wheelchair. 

He took the photographs between the ages of 16 and 36 and died in Totnes, Devon, in 1947 aged 57.

The collection shows the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham.

Through his research, Mr Wiebe has discovered Graily survived his time as a soldier in the Great War, only to die in mysterious circumstances in a hotel room in France several years later aged only 30.

He has also learned that although Graily and Doris both married neither of them had children. Mr Wiebe, who has now become one of The Mo's trustees, now plans to continue his research in to the Hewitt family.

Sheringham's Mo museum, which is run mainly by volunteers, lacked the manpower and resources to formally catalogue the negatives and slides when they were donated in 1991.

They were left in a cupboard for more than two decades as a result.

A £6,000 Big Society Fund grant has enabled the museum to begin tackling the backlog, properly preserve the Hewitt collection and buy touch screen computers to enable visitors to view all of its photographs easily.

High life: The collection shows the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham

Having fun: The pictures show the Hewitts and their friends looking content and happy while they enjoy their holiday

Museum manager Philip Miles said the collection was one of the most exciting things the museum had ever found. 

Mr Miles said: 'The work Ron has done for us would have cost thousands of pounds.'The museum couldn't exist without the volunteers. 

'We
are very appreciative of his work and pleased that we have been able to
preserve the collection for future generations to enjoy.

The Mo will reopen on March 1.
