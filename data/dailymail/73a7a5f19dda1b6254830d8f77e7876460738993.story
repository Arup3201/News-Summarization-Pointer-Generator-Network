Charlie Edgeworth, 19, decided to undergo breast reduction surgery after being branded 'Mooby' by bullies for years

A teenage boy sold his car to pay for breast reduction surgery after being bullied at school for years.

Charlie Edgeworth, 19, was nicknamed 'Mooby' by cruel bullies when a common medical condition caused him to grow breasts when he was just 13.

The call centre worker, from Hastings, East Sussex, suffers from a gynaecomastia - a hormone imbalance meaning he has more oestrogen than testosterone - causing the excess breast tissue.

He was so mortified by his B cup chest that he has never had a girlfriend - and used to hide away in baggy jumpers, even in the height of summer.

Desperate to reduce his chest, Mr Edgeworth went on a strict diet - causing his weight to plummet to a dangerous nine stone when he was still at school - but it only made his chest more prominent.

But after years of torment, he finally decided to sell his car to fund a £2,000 breast reduction - and is hoping his new chest will help him find love.

Mr Edgeworth said: 'My moobs stuck out so much the kids called me names for the duration of high school.

'I hadn't taken my top off in public since primary school and never went topless in the house so my mum didn't even know.

'Whenever we went on holiday I always wore a t-shirt in the pool - I just told people I burnt easily to shut them up.

'I tried everything to make them disappear but when I lost weight it just made them stand out more.

'In the end I put weight on to cover up the disparity between my chest and stomach.' 

In an attempt to hide his embarrassment, he always wore a school jumper one size too big even if the summer sun was blazing.

Even after school, his confidence was knocked and his love life took a knock, meaning he hasn't had a girlfriend since he was 13.

Mr Edgeworth said: 'It's hard to get close to somebody when you have this hang up.

'It's difficult to keep seeing someone when you're constantly thinking "I've got bigger boobs than you".

Mr Edgeworth suffered from gynaecomastia - a hormone imbalance meaning he had more oestrogen than testosterone - causing him to grow B-cup breasts at age 13

'For the last six years I haven't had a serious partner because of it, which is a bloody long time.' 

Excessive development of male breasts — also known as gynaecomastia — is thought to affect 40 per cent of men and it seems the proportion is rising.

High-profile sufferers include Ricky Gervais and Simon Cowell.

The condition can be provoked by an imbalance of the sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone.

It can also be triggered by certain medication like antidepressants, heart and liver pills, some cancer drugs and illegal drugs like cannabis and anabolic steroids. 

He now has to wear a compression vest but says he already feels like 'a completely different person'

Mr Edgeworth's lowest point came when his previous boss mentioned he looked a bit 'mooby'.

After that, he began to look in to surgical options.

Three years later, the 19-year-old decided to go under the knife and had 200ml of fat and glandular tissue removed from each breast.

The teenager sold his pride and joy - a 2003 Volkswagen Polo - to pay £1,750 for breast reduction and nipple inversion in Poland through EuropeSurgery.

To aid the recovery process he must wear a compression vest,  but says he already feels like a completely different person.

He said: 'This has been a massive confidence boost and I can't wait to start dating.

'I wasn't expecting the results to be as good as they are.

'It sounds like a cliché, but I feel like my life can begin now.

'If I hadn't gone abroad I would never have been able to afford to have the surgery.

'I looked into it and it's about £5,000 over here.

'With EuropeSurgery they talked me through everything and even let me speak to previous patients, it really put my mind at ease.'

Adam Kalecinski, the surgeon who performed Mr Edgeworth's operation, said: 'I am extremely pleased with the results of Charlie's surgery and I am looking forward to seeing him in one of our UK aftercare clinics.

'It's essential to remove glandular tissue as well as fat to stop the problem returning in a couple of years.' 

Gynaecomastia (sometimes referred to as 'man boobs', or moobs, is a common condition that causes boys’ and men’s breasts to swell and become larger than normal. 

It is most common in teenage boys and older men.

It can be caused by an imbalance between the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen.

Oestrogen causes breast tissue to grow. While all men produce some oestrogen, they usually have much higher levels of testosterone, which stops the oestrogen from causing breast tissue to grow.

If the balance of hormones in his body changes, this can cause a man’s breasts to grow. Sometimes, the cause of this imbalance is unknown.

The growth in breast tissue is not due to extra body fat from being overweight, so losing weight or doing more exercise will not improve the condition.

During puberty, boys’ hormone levels vary. If the level of testosterone drops, oestrogen can cause breast tissue to grow. Many teenage boys have some degree of breast enlargement.

As men get older, they produce less testosterone. Also, older men tend to have more body fat, and this can cause more oestrogen to be produced. These changes in hormone levels can lead to excess breast tissue growth.
