England's Under 16s replicated the seniors by beating Scotland - but it wasn't enough to claim the Sky Sports Victory Shield as Wales lifted the trophy.

The Young Lions entered the match at Huish Park in Yeovil knowing their slender chances of winning the competition had been ended by Wales, who beat Northern Ireland 2-0 earlier in the evening to end a 66-year wait to win the Victory Shield outright.

And so coach Steve Cooper urged his players to savour the opportunity of taking on the Auld Enemy and they certainly did, with goals from Arsenal's Joe Willock and Chelsea's Martell Taylor-Crossdale earning a 2-1 win either side of Jack Thomson's equaliser for the Scots.

Wales won the Victory Shield outright for the first time in 66 years with a 2-0 win over Northern Ireland in Ballymena.

West Brom striker Tyler Roberts opened the scoring with a 27th-minute header and Swansea's Liam Cullen sealed victory with 17 minutes to play.

Wales have won all three of their matches in this season's competition.

England had lost 1-0 to Wales and beaten Northern Ireland 1-0 earlier in the competition but will have to wait until next year to claim the famous old trophy for a 36th time.

In front of a crowd of over 4,700 in Somerset, Scotland, who are coached by former Nottingham Forest midfielder Scot Gemmill, started the brighter.

England goalkeeper Taye Ashby-Hammond denied Zak Rudden by diving bravely at his feet in the opening minutes and he showed good reflexes to get down and parry away Liam Burt's shot.

But slightly against the run of play, England took the lead after 27 minutes. West Brom's Jonathan Leko drove forward and played it to Willock whose first touch took him past a defender's challenge before he smashed the ball into the bottom corner.

Scotland drew level just five minutes into the second-half. Jack Adamson's free-kick from 20 yards out rattled the crossbar and half-time substitute Thomson gobbled up the rebound.

Taylor-Crossdale, who also came on at half-time, nearly restored England's lead immediately but was denied by Celtic goalkeeper Aidan McAdams.

But he made no mistake shortly afterwards. Receiving the ball wide right, the Chelsea man took the ball past Daniel Baur before firing a sweet left-footed strike that beat McAdams.

And Taylor-Crossdale could have extended England's lead following a quick-fire one-two with Vashon Neufville but McAdams blocked his effort from six yards out.

Scotland enjoyed chances too in the second-half, with Ashby-Hammond producing a superb save to deny Rudden late on.

But England held on for victory, to the delight of the crowd, and end the 2014 Victory Shield in second place, three points behind Wales.
