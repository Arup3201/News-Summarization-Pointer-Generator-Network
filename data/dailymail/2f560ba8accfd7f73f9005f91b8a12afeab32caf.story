The Bank of England was yesterday accused of behaving like ‘an unreliable boyfriend’ for sending out mixed messages about when interest rates will rise.

During a grilling by the Treasury Select Committee, Bank governor Mark Carney was criticised for leaving homeowners ‘not really knowing where they stand’.

Although Mr Carney predicted that interest rates – which have been held at a record low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – would rise soon, he would not give a firm answer as to when that might be.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney appeared to play down the prospect of an early interest rate rise

Labour MP Pat McFadden told him: ‘It 
strikes me the Bank is behaving a bit like an unreliable boyfriend – one
 day hot, one day cold. The people on the other side of the message are 
left not really knowing where they stand.’

It
 is now widely expected that interest rates will rise before the 2015 
election and maybe even as early as the end of this year, which will 
have huge implications for millions of homeowners.

And
 Mr Carney raised concern about the 1.4million who have bought their 
first home since July 2007, the last time interest rates were increased,
 and have never experienced a sudden rise in the monthly cost of their 
mortgage.

Mr Carney said: ‘One danger is that, having lived through years of interest rates at rock-bottom  levels, people assume they never go up. We have to dispel that.’

But
 the governor also took pains to stress that when interest rates do 
start rising, the process will be ‘limited and gradual’ – a phrase he 
used nine times during the two-hour hearing.

Economists predict the rate will be about 2.5 per cent by 2017.

MPs on the Treasury select committee questioned whether Mr Carney considered the impact of his comments on the money markets

During
 the select committee hearing, Mr Carney appeared to row back on a 
warning last week that rates could rise before the end of the year.

He told MPs that low wage growth and spare capacity in the economy meant a rate rise this year was less likely.

He
 struck a markedly different tone to his Mansion House speech last week,
 when he suggested the cost of borrowing would increase before the end 
of 2014, adding: 'It could happen sooner than markets currently expect.'

It was seen as a clear signal that homeowners had to brace themselves for a rate hike.

But
 giving evidence to the Treasury select committee today, Mr Carney 
suggested the tentative economic recovery meant interest rates could 
remain at their historic low of 0.5 per cent for longer.

The Bank of England base rate of interest has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent since 2009

He stressed that the decision to make the first increase in rates for five years would be based on the state of the economy. 

'The
 start of normalising of interest rates, the exact timing of that will 
be driven by the data, but the most important aspect of the guidance is 
that the increase in rates will be limited and gradual.'

He warned that Britain would still be 'living in extraordinary times a few years down the road'.

Mr
 Carney was grilled by MPs about whether his Mansion House speech was 
giving his personal view or the official line of the Bank's Monetary 
Policy Committee.

He
 insisted that his comments were in line with Bank policy and wanted to 
shift market expectations about when a rate rise would come: 'Really what we are trying to do is we would like to see the market adjust to the data.'

Last
 year the Bank said interest rates would not rise until the unemployment
 rate fell to 7 per cent, but when that target was met earlier than 
expected, it set broader criteria for a rise.

Mr McFadden said: 'The purpose of guidance is to achieve clarity of expectations among households and consumers.'

But Mr Carney insisted the message from Bank guidance had been 'very clearly received'. 

'As
 the economy progresses, the time to normalise interest rates is edging 
closer. It is coming closer. But what is most relevant is those 
adjustments will be through a gradual process that is likely to be lower
 that historical averages.' 

Ahead of the hearing, the Institute of Directors issued a call for interest rates to rise, possibly as early as this autumn.

House prices in London rose by 18.7 per cent in the year to April,almost twice the national average of 9.9 per cent

IoD
 chief economist James Sproule said: 'As the recovery takes hold it will
 soon be the time to start taking interest rates to a level where 
monetary policy can once again become an effective economic lever.

'Ideally
 this rise in interest rates will be achieved gradually, starting in the
 autumn of 2014, with an aim of reaching a more normal level, perhaps 3 
per cent, by autumn 2015.' 

Mr
 Carney is expected to announce new rules later this week to further cut
 back on large and risky mortgage loans in a bid to head off the threat 
of a housing bubble.

Prices
 rose by 9.9 per cent in the year to April, surging by 18.7 per cent in 
London. In 33 areas of England and Wales, property prices increased in 
value by more than annual local wages.

First-time buyers have been hardest hit by the boom, with prices for them rising by more than 10 per cent in a year.

People
 getting on to the first rung of the property ladder paid a record 
£199,000 in April, almost 10 times the average salary of people in their
 twenties.

It is already getting harder for buyers to get a loan, with banks limiting mortgage approvals despite rising demand.

The Bank of England reports that lenders forecast a 'lower appetite for risk' over the next three months

Prices paid by first-time buyers are up 10.7 per cent year-on-year, but only 9.5 per cent for those already on the property ladder

High street banks and lenders expect the number of new mortgage agreements to fall significantly from July to September.

It
 follows changes to the Mortgage Market Review which forces lenders to 
more closely scrutinise borrowers' income and outgoings to check if they
 can afford repayments if interest rates rise.

In the past, people applying for a mortgage were asked for three months’ pay slips and recent bank statements to show their major outgoings.

But since April they have faced invasive questions about their finances and lifestyle, from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership.

New rules limiting the amount that can be loaned in relation to incomes will also push down mortgage approval rates.

Jonathan Harris, a director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: 'Demand is still strong as buyers remain confident of their ability to get a mortgage and their perception that now is a good time to buy, with more stock coming onto the market.'
