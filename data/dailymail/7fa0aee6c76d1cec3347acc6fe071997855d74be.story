The First Daughters coordinated in bright shades of purple today as they watched their father sworn in for his second term as President.

Proving they have inherited the same sartorial instincts as their mother, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11, looked elegant in bright tailored outerwear that set off their mother's navy Thom Browne dress-coat.

Holding her own among the A-list guests, which included Beyonce and Kelly Clarkson, Malia chose amethyst J Crew - the same label she and her sister wore for her father's first swearing-in ceremony four years ago.

Mingling with the stars: Michelle Obama is pictured with (from left) her mother Marian Robinson, and daughters Sasha, 11, and Malia, 14, in congratulating Beyonce on her performance today

Best of friends: Mrs Obama greets Beyonce after she performs the National Anthem during the public ceremonial inauguration on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol

She teamed it with an oxblood snood, 
tights and ballerina flats, and navy gloves which picked out the shade 
of the blue dress she wore beneath.

In turn, Sasha earned style stripes of her own in a full-skirted lavender Kate Spade coat and a dress from the same label.

The bright stuff: We had a first look at Malia and Sasha's coordinated outfits as they arrived at a Washington D.C. church with their parents this morning

Quality time with grandma: Sasha (center) and Malia (right) were seated with grandmother, Marian Robinson

At ease: Cheeky Sasha leans over to her mother - clad in Thom Browne - as she and her sister prepare to take their seats for today's ceremony

She also seems to have inherited 
Michelle's love of the statement necklace, sporting a bejeweled number 
that could well have been borrowed from her mom's jewelry box.

The New York-based label was thrilled to see the youngster in its creations. Deborah
Lloyd, President and Creative Director of Kate Spade New York told 
MailOnline: 'It is an honor that Sasha Obama chose to wear Kate Spade 
New York.

'She epitomizes the youthful optimism and
colorful spirit of the brand. We are so proud to have been a part of 
this historic moment.'

Capturing the moment: Both girls clutched iPhones, complete with novelty covers, to record photos from the memorable day

iHistory: The President and the First Lady seemed as keen for Malia to capture one particular shot as she was

J Crew was equally proud, tweeting: 'So proud to be part of history today.'

But though the occasion was formal - and the Obama girls certainly looked the part - it seems the atmosphere was relaxed.

Sasha could be seen leaning over to talk to her mother, and sharing a joke with her big sister before the ceremony began.

Color scheme: Malia wore an amethyst J Crew coat with an oxblood snood, tights and ballerina flats. Her navy leather leather gloves picked out the color of her royal blue dress, peeking from beneath the hem of her coat

Earning her style stripes: Sasha wore a lavender Kate Spade coat with a purple full-skirted dress with wide horizontal stripes. She seems to have inherited Michelle's love of the statement necklace too

Now and then: The girls' bright outfits were as much a highlight of today's inauguration (left) as they were in 2009 (right), when they were both dressed in custom J Crew

Michelle could be seen talking Malia 
through the proceedings, and afterwards, the sisters were on-hand to 
give their father a congratulatory hug.

Both girls carried iPhones - complete
with novelty covers - and could even be seen recording their own 
version of events by taking their own snaps.

Proud: Malia and Sasha look on as their father, U.S. President Barack Obama takes the Oath of Office

Mother-daughter moment: Malia and Michelle observe the crowd during the ceremony

We had a first glimpse of Michelle, Malia and Sasha's outfits this morning, when they joined the Preisdent and maternal grandmother for a 
moment of quiet reflection ahead of a day filled with festivities.

Keeping with her navy theme from yesterday, Michelle Obama once again stepped out in a tailored navy coat this morning by Thom Browne.

According to NBC News' White House 
Correspondent, Kristen Welker, Mrs Obama's Thom Browne coat was made 
from fabric specifically developed to mimic the style of a manâ€™s silk 
tie.

Elegant: The First Lady teamed her Thom Browne ensemble with a necklace designed by Cathy Waterman, and J Crew shoes (left). Later, she changed into boots and added a J Crew belt (right)

Thom Browne is still best known as a menswear designer, and he often channels classic male style aesthetics for his womenswear line - with an outright feminine twist, like Mrs Obama's nipped-in waist and bell-shaped hem.

The designer told the New York Times' Eric Wilson: 'It's one of those moments when I just can't believe that happened.'

The First Lady teamed the outfit with a necklace designed by Cathy Waterman, and J Crew belt and shoes.

Looking sharp: Michelle and her daughters' coats all echoed the same fitted, full-skirted silhouette

The hues of today's looks echoed the colors they wore yesterday, when Michelle wore dark blue-and-black Reed Krakoff, Malia 
recycled a royal blue H&M dress, and Sasha wore a dusky pink frock 
with a high-waisted gold belt.

The President attended the service this morning at St. John's Episcopal Church with Vice President Joe Biden.

Thousands of elated supporters have already streamed into the nation's 
sunlit capital ahead of the festivities, just hours after Obama was 
sworn into office in a low key ceremony on Sunday.
