It's every shopaholic’s dream – a debit card that credits your account with the amount you spend instead of leaving you poorer.

So when Sarah Wood realised her Maestro card had become her golden ticket to free spending, she made the most of it to the tune of £10,000.

But, inevitably, her luck soon ran out and once the authorities realised what was going on 42-year-old Wood found herself in court charged with fraud.

Sara Mattin, 42, and former husband Steven Mattin, 43, used a pre-paid debit card to con a shop out of £20,000 because every time they bought something money was put into their account, instead of being taken out

Her pre-pay card was used to buy 
£10,137 worth of goods from an independent mini-market, prosecutors 
said, all the while crediting Wood’s account instead of debiting it – so
 she effectively gained more than £20,000.

The
 court heard this was potentially the result of a computer glitch, or 
due to the fact that the shopkeeper may have been processing the 
payments incorrectly – causing the store to not only give away goods for
 free but also accidentally pay to top up the card.

Wood
 and her ex-partner Steven Mattin, 43, who had joined her in the 
nine-month spending spree, both pleaded guilty to fraud. The court heard
 the pair, neither of whom are believed to be in employment, visited the
 store so often they befriended the owner.

Pre-paid debit cards work in much the same way as regular debit cards, except when the balance reaches zero, they cannot be used any more, similar to travel money cards used on holiday.  

They are often used for household expenses such as shopping because they allow users to keep accurate tabs on how much they are using.

Nigel
 Clive, for Mattin, told Hull Crown Court that Wood was the main 
instigator of the fraudulent spending, although Mattin was aware of what
 was going on.

‘It was a 
genuine card,’ he said. ‘They don’t understand how the money was put on 
it, whether it was a glitch in the system or the shopkeeper didn’t know 
how it worked, but once they realised, they did carry on like it was a 
golden ticket.’

Prosecutor David Bradshaw said that once the owner of 
the shop, in Hornsea, East Yorkshire, realised what the card was doing 
they phoned the issuer, who had no idea why it could be happening. So in
 May last year, the owner contacted police.

At first Mattin did not realise what was happening, but after becoming aware of the mistake, she took advantage of the shop-owner, visiting up to seven times a day

Mr Bradshaw added: ‘The shopkeeper seems to be the loser in this.’

Richard
 Thompson, for Wood, told the court she regretted fraudulently using the
 card, and felt she had ‘betrayed’ the shop staff.

Judge
 Michael Mettyear handed Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, a 
nine-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months and ordered her to 
carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

He said: ‘This was a golden ticket and although it doesn’t condone it, the fact is a machine or person made the mistake.

‘It doesn’t forgive or excuse what you did, but you took advantage of it.’

Drug
 addict Mattin, of no fixed address, was also sentenced for burglary 
after breaking into Wood’s neighbour’s house for money to buy valium, 
shortly after he was released from prison for a previous offence.

The
 court heard he took a jar of change, two laptops and some prescription 
pills, as well as ripping the money out of birthday cards. He was jailed
 for three years.
