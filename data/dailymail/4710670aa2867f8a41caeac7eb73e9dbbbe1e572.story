Neil Warnock has admitted Crystal Palace will face a transfer-deadline frenzy after he put recruitment plans on hold for Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Newcastle.

The new Eagles boss secured Wilfried Zaha's Selhurst Park return on Thursday on a season-long loan deal from Manchester United.

Warnock set Friday aside for team preparations, leaving just Sunday and Monday for Palace to complete as many as four more deals.

Keep calm and carry on: New Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock is biding his time in the transfer market

Guess who's back! Wilfried Zaha returns to Selhurst Park on loan from Manchester United

The transfer window shuts at 11pm on Monday, with Palace still keen on Southampton's Jack Cork and Norwich's Gary Hooper.

'I have had 320 messages from agents and they are all brilliant players, all with different agents,' said Warnock, who cut off his Cornwall retirement to return to the south London club.

'I doubt we can do anything before the weekend.

'We need to get through the weekend. If we can get three or four players, I think we can hold our own.

'Hopefully by Sunday, Monday night we will have a couple of people to show you. I'm sure it will be chaos, it always is.'

Tony Pulis quit Palace on the eve of the new league season after rowing with owner Steve Parish over transfer strategy.

Warnock revealed he did not even discuss recruitment or transfer funds with co-chairman Parish before agreeing to take the Selhurst Park helm.

'You don't talk about anything like that,' he said.

'I didn't talk about money or anything, it was the opportunity.

'I think contracts came later. You don't get opportunities like this very often.

'Probably in different circumstances, there might have been four or five other managers who might have enjoyed it as well. But I'm very fortunate I have the job now.

'I'm going to really enjoy it, if I can.'

Palace have started the Premier League season with back-to-back defeats, 2-1 at Arsenal and 3-1 at home to West Ham.

Dwight Gayle blasted a hat-trick as the Eagles eased past Walsall 3-0 in a routine midweek Capital One Cup victory, but the Selhurst Park men know they must kick-start league proceedings without further delay.

Warnock's new side take on Alan Pardew's Newcastle at St James' Park on Saturday, desperate for points and morale. 

Warnock, who admitted he was once again unable to commit to retirement, said Palace must close ranks to stand any chance of victory in the north east.

'I've had four retirements but I couldn't resist,' he said.

'I don't think we should rest on our laurels.

'It would be easy to be disappointed when someone leaves like they have done, and it's difficult for the players because they have had such a fantastic time.

'And Tony's done a fantastic job, but now we have to regroup and look to the future and do the best we can.

'Yes it might be difficult on Saturday when I've only been here a couple of days, but I still think we can go up there in good spirits and I'm looking forward to it.'
