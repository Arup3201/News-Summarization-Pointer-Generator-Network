A high school drama teacher who allegedly had sex with a 15-year-old student told the boy that she would kill herself if he revealed their affair to anyone, according to prosecutors.

Stephanie McCrea, a 35-year-old married mother-of-one from Vancouver, Washington, was taken into custody on Tuesday after the school learned about the alleged relationship earlier this month.

On Wednesday, she appeared in Clark County Superior Court to be arraigned on charges of third-degree child rape, witness tampering and sexual misconduct with a minor.

The boy told authorities that he met McCrea four or five times each week in her office, where they would kiss before school and after drama rehearsals, according to court documents shared by The Oregonian.

He also said that she performed a sex act on him at school before the Christmas break, and over the vacation, she allegedly collected the boy and took him to her home for sex.

They then met up with other drama class students and went to a movie, with the permission of the boy's parents, according to the court documents.

Once they returned to school after the break, they had sex on the campus, the boy told police.

Clark County prosecutor Camara Banfield told Judge David Gregorson that McCrea had threatened to kill herself if the student revealed the alleged sex abuse, The Oregonian reported.

The victim even agreed to set up fake Facebook accounts to avoid detection, she said.

McCrea, an English and theater teacher at Evergreen High School, was put on administrative leave after the school learned of the alleged affair - but the sexual abuse continued, Banfield said.

McCrea's attorney, Steve Thayer, said McCrea and her husband separated a month ago and that she attempted to take her life two weeks ago. He said in court documents that she started suffering mental health issues after a car accident in 2012.

Judge Gregorson set her bail at $40,000 and ordered McCrea to have no contact with the boy. She is only allowed to have contact with her own child, a nine-year-old son, the judge said.

At work: McCrea, pictured at a rehearsal, was put on administrative leave earlier this month after the school's administrators learned about the allegations. They contacted police, who launched an investigation

She will be able to enter her plea at a formal arraignment next month.

Principal Lisa Emmerich shared 'the disturbing news' of McCrea's arrest in an email to parents, reported The Columbian. 

Emmerich explained that as soon as administrators learned of the accusations, they contacted Vancouver police, who launched an investigation. The school continues to work with the police.

McCrea was hired by the school in 2006 after passing all necessary background checks, she said.

'At this point, no other students have been identified or come forward with additional information or allegations,' her letter read. 

Property records listed her as living with a 34-year-old man in Vancouver. Students also told KOIN6 that she has one child.

Most recently, she directed a student play called 'The Investigation' and afterwards, she took to the theatre department's Facebook play to gush about the show.

'I could not have asked for a better experience as a teacher and director. Thank you all,' she wrote.

Some students spoke out in defense of their teacher following her arrested.

'I just can't believe this is happening,' one teenager wrote on Twitter. 'I'm so thankful for everything she has taught... Doesn't change anything.' 

Another, Hanna Turnbow, told KOIN6 that the teacher had always been fair.

'She's very family-oriented,' she said. 'She was always very strict about sexual harassment rules, you know, dressing rooms when we did plays and stuff. Boys are on one side, girls are on the other.' 

Counselors will be available to talk with students who request support, Emmerich said, and a substitute teacher is now filling in for McCrea's classes.

The program's one-acts and spring musical auditions have also been canceled until further notice. 

She is next due in court on February 11.
