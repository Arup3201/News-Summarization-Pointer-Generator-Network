An audio recording of underwater sounds might have captured the moment MH370 crashed into the ocean.

The low-frequency sound was picked up by underwater listening devices in the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia on March 8, the same day the Boeing 777 disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board.

Researchers at Curtin University in Western Australia have been analysing the signal to see if it may be the sound of the plane crashing into the ocean.

The recording would place the missing plane in the central Indian Ocean – nearly 5,000km from cape Leeuwin on the Perth coastline, outside the original southern Indian Ocean search zone.

An underwater recording may have captured the moment the missing Malaysia Airlines plane hit the water after it lost contact on March 8

The low-frequency noise was picked up by two devices near the Perth coast, just off Cape Leeuwin and Rottnest Island.

The sound was detected at 1.30am, on March 8, ten minutes after MH370 lost contact with air traffic control.

'One signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash,' Dr Alec Duncan, a senior research fellow with the Centre for Marine Science and Technology told CNN.

The researchers have calculated an 'uncertainty box' for the signal's origin. The box stretches some 4,000 kilometers in length from southeast to northwest across the Indian Ocean.

At its widest point it spans some 200 to 300 kilometers in width.

These are the type of CMST Acoustic Recorders that captured the possible MH370 noise. They are programmed autonomous underwater acoustic receivers, capable of recording underwater sound for many months

'The sound was heard very approximately 5000km from Cape Leeuwin. It's a very rubbery number,' Dr Alec Duncan told MailOnline.

The scientist said he is only '10 per cent' sure that the noise came from MH370 hitting the water or the implosion of parts of the aircraft as it sank.

'We've been very up front that this is fairly unlikely to be revealed to be MH370.'

Dr Duncan does not believe that releasing this new information will give false to hope the families who have lost their loved ones, instead he thinks it will come as a reassurance.

'I think it will be reassuring for families to know people are beavering away in the background... despite the fact that what we've found is not going to help a lot.' 

Curtin University researchers have used underwater sound recordings to come up with a possible estimate for where MH370 might have crashed. One of the recordings was taken at Rottnest Island (shown in this map)

Unfortunately the locations of the sound recordings do not match up with the original search arc plotted in the southern Indian Ocean, where 26 nations, using either ships, aircraft or technical expertise, have been searching the waters off the Australian coast.

He believes the most likely source of the noise was probably an earthquake or other natural event.

However, Dr Duncan claimed search teams are still 'probably going to take a look there' and that he and his team will 'keep chipping away' at trying to locate the plane .

'I certainly would if I was them. There's certainly not a lot else to go on.'

The data that he and his team at Curtin University have uncovered has already attracted significant interest from search authorities.

'They've been encouraging us considerably to keep on looking at it and to refine the numbers. I've been over to Canberra to talk to them and we continue to have a very close relationship with them,' Dr Duncan told WA Today.

One of the underwater listening devices that recorded the low frequency sound is located some 20 kilometres off Perth.

It's designed to listen to whales and other marine life but it can also detect black box 'pings' in the 30-40 kHz range.

Another of the devices is designed to listen for signs of underwater nuclear explosions

It's operated by the U.N.-chartered Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as part of the International Monitoring System.

Seismic acoustic analyst with the CTBTO Mark Prior told CNN that it's possible for the devices to record a plane crash 'but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular'.

The Joint Agency Coordination Centre, who are organising the search for the missing plane, said they would consider Curtin University's findings but said: 'The current results are not compatible with the international search team's analysis of the most likely area where MH370 entered the water.'

The search for the missing plane is now focused on the southern Indian Ocean, which is 5,000km from where the sound was recorded
