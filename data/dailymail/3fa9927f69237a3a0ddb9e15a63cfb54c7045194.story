Barry Edwards, 44, left his girlfriend with a perforated lung and unable to walk after a nine-hour campaign of violence at her home in Rochdale 

A thug who once changed his name to 'Naughty Rascal' tortured his girlfriend for nine hours and threatened to 'break her f****** spine' before beating her so severely she was left unable to walk.

Barry Edwards's victim was so traumatised by the ordeal in May last year that she cut her wrists in a suicide bid, Manchester Crown Court was told.

The 44-year-old left his victim's blood splattered across the walls of her home in Rochdale and managed to perforate her lung during the sickening attack.

In a sadistic game, Edwards also made the woman stand facing a wall, holding a piece of card against it with her nose.

He then inflicted more savage beatings on his partner using razor blades and a baseball bat when the card fell to the floor.

Edwards has now been jailed for 16 years for the violent attack, which one detective described as the worst case of domestic abuse he had ever seen. 

The court heard how the abuse only ended when neighbours heard loud banging noises, followed by Edwards threatening to break the woman's spine.

The neighbours reported the incident to police, after hearing the victim respond 'Don't Baz, please don't, I don't want to die'. 

When officers arrived at the home, they discovered blood-stained walls and found the victim unable to walk because her legs had been beaten so badly, the court was told.

Paul Hodgkinson, prosecuting, said the woman's face had been slashed with razor blades. Several rolls of tape covered in the victim's blood were also left dotted around the scene.

The woman initially claimed her injuries were suffered at the hands of strangers. But she later admitted she had suffered abuse at the hands of Edwards for eight years.

The court heard how she told officers she and Edwards - who had previously changed his name to Damian Hayes and Naughty Rascal - began their relationship when he was 36 and she was a teenager.

In fits of violence, Edwards would force his partner into a cubby hole beneath the stairs, the court was told.

When she crawled out he would throw dumbbells at her, once breaking her arm as she tried to protect herself.

His campaign of violence also saw the victim tied-up, beaten with a variety of weapons, slashed with blades and repeatedly kicked in the head.

He once turned an aerosol can into a makeshift flamethrower to burn her hair and face, the court was told.

Edwards also tried to gouge her eyeballs out with his thumbs and kicked her down the stairs. He had once threatened to throw electrical items into the bathtub while she was in it, the court heard. 

Edwards, of no fixed address, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to grievous bodily harm with intent, two counts of false imprisonment and two counts of threatening to kill. 

The court heard Edwards had been jailed for nine years in 1994 after torturing another girlfriend.

He started seeing that victim after she was released from local authority care as a teenager. 

He had attacked her with a vegetable knife and killed three cats they owned during their relationship.

The girl was so afraid of Edwards that she regularly soiled herself over the terror he inflicted upon her.

It culminated in Edwards dragging the girl to an abandoned building site, where he dug a hole and forced his partner to climb in.

He then piled bricks on top of her before urinating on the girl's head. He then left her for dead.

The girl later escaped and reported the abuse to police.

Edwards was given a nine-year prison sentence, which was later reduced to seven on appeal. 

Sentencing for the latest attack, Judge Mushtaq Khokar said there was a significant risk of reoffending, as the abuse was a carbon copy of the earlier offences. 

He added: 'I am not surprised she said she wanted to jump out of a window to end it all.'

Speaking after the case Detective Constable Russ Clarke said: 'This is one of the most horrendous incidents of domestic abuse I have ever dealt with, leaving the woman with terrible lifelong injuries.'

He added: 'It is also my firm view that without a diligent member of the public contacting the police, it is likely this woman would have lost her life.

'I hope this case shows others who may be suffering from domestic abuse that speaking up is the best thing you can do.'
