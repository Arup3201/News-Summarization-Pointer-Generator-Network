Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis has returned to training after collapsing at Tottenham on March 4.

Gomis was kept in a London hospital overnight for observation after leaving the White Hart Lane pitch on a stretcher and wearing an oxygen mask after several minutes of treatment.

The 12-times capped France international's collapse sparked memories of Fabrice Muamba's cardiac arrest at White Hart Lane while the midfielder was playing for Bolton in an FA Cup tie in March 2012, but it later emerged that Gomis suffers from a vasovagal condition.

Medical staff attended to the France international for four minutes before he regained consciousness 

The condition causes low blood pressure and Gomis had previously fainted on a number of occasions while playing in French football, something Swansea were aware of when they signed the 29-year-old from Lyon last summer.

Swansea's players were given an extended six-day break following their 3-2 defeat at Tottenham and Gomis joined his team-mates on their return to training after making a short visit to France.

'Bafe is back in Swansea and trained today,' a club spokesman told Sportsmail on Wednesday.

Gomis took to social media within hours of collapsing to alleviate concern about his well-being.

'I Wanted to reassure you concerning my Health, it actually looks much more scary than physically dangerous and I am feeling well now,' Gomis posted via his Twitter account.

'I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father health that requires me to go back and forth to France.

'I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight but now everything is back In order.

'I also want to thank everyone for their support and get Well messages.'

Gomis is expected to be given the all-clear for Swansea's Barclays Premier League home game with Liverpool on Monday evening. 

Gomis has only managed five goals in all competitions since his summer arrival from Lyon

On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham.

The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch.

Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned.

Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance.

Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football.
