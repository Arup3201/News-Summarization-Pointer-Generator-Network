A 70-year-old tennis referee who was preparing to work at the U.S. Open in New York has been arrested for bludgeoning her 80-year-old husband to death with a coffee mug at their Los Angeles home.

Police officers from New York and L.A. swooped on Lois Ann 'Lolo' Goodman as she had breakfast at the Sheraton Hotel, where she was staying in New York City, at 8.a.m Tuesday.

She was wearing her official U.S. Open uniform - a blue Ralph Lauren sweatsuit and sneakers - when she was taken away by police.

Goodman, a mother of three daughters, is accused of killing her husband, Alan, during a fight at their home on April 17, and then trying to make it appear as if he had fallen down the stairs.

Sources told the New York Post she stands accused of smacking him across the head with the coffee mug and then stabbing him with of its smashed pieces.

She told police she returned home after umpiring a tennis match and found him dead, but 'there was a lot of blood inside the apartment', an LAPD source told the New York Post.

'There was no sign of forced entry,' the source said. 'Obviously, he was killed by someone who knew him and had a key.'

It came after weeks of arguing, according to a groundskeeper in their gated community. Police had even visited the home a handful of times to see to disturbances, Alfonso Rosas said.

'One time, she was fighting with the police and screamed at them,' he said.

A neighbour told the LA Daily News that she once saw Lois in her front yard and the woman said of her husband: 'He's driving me crazy.'

After her husband's death, she 
reported called a cleaner to deal with the blood-soaked carpets. 'She 
didn't seem at all upset,' neighbour Michael Rudchenko said.

Alan Goodman's death was originally 
ruled suspicious by police, but investigators could not determine if 
foul play was involved, the Los Angeles Police Department said.

After
a full homicide investigation on August 2, police ruled he had indeed 
been killed after he was attacked with a sharp object.

Los Angeles police Lt. David Storaker told the L.A. Times that his death 'was a suspicious death from the onset'.

He
said Alan Goodman's head injuries were consistent with an attack, and 
the coroner's office agreed, adding it appeared he had also fallen.

'It was a homicide. He had multiple sharp-force injuries,' Ed Winter, assistant chief of investigations for the coroner, said.

Goodman became a prime suspect - but she was already on her way to New York for the Open, which begins on Monday.

Police said it was difficult to 
track down Goodman as she often travels for weeks at a time. 
They found out she she was scheduled to be in New York for the U.S. Open and worked with the NYPD to take her into custody.

'If need be, we [would have] gone' to the U.S. Open, Storaker added.

She was taken into custody on a warrant filed a week ago by the L.A. County district attorney's office.

She was arraigned on the murder charge in Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday and waived extradition.

Prosecutors said they would ask that her bail be set at $1 million. She faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.

Goodman is well known in tennis circles 
and was preparing to serve as a referee at the U.S. Open Tennis 
Championships tournament, a district attorney's office spokeswoman, Jane
Robison, said.

She has refereed at the U.S. and Australian Opens for years, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Goodman has umpired with some of the world's top tennis players since the 1970s, including matches featuring Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova.

In a 1994 interview with the L.A. Times, she said: 'It's exciting. This is my favorite sport and I'm out there rubbing shoulders with the best players. There's no real way to describe it.'
