Plans to make Commons staff wear name badges have sparked a revolt by women who claim it will encourage male MPs to leer at their chests.

They claim some MPs already ‘harass’ and ‘abuse’ them, and forcing people to wear name badges will make things worse.

The badge plan is backed by the Commons’ governance committee, chaired by Labour MP Jack Straw.

It is designed to make it easier for parliamentary staff to be recognised by MPs and fellow staff. 

But when staff were asked for their views, it produced complaints from women and from men worried about how female colleagues would be affected.

One person said: ‘Badges risk making younger or junior staff – especially women – more vulnerable. 

'Harassment and rude comments by MPs are still commonplace. Having your name on show means the abuse can be personalised.’

Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg defended the proposal

Another was ‘not comfortable with people staring at my chest to find out who I am’. 

A third staff member said: ‘A simple conversation should be sufficient in introducing ourselves to colleagues and to MPs, without encouraging strangers to peer at our chests.’ 

Acting Commons Clerk David Natzler has acknowledged the scale of protests, saying: ‘A number of female staff expressed objections on the basis that the position of the name badge would give some people an excuse to stare at their chests.’

Some staff are threatening to refuse to co-operate with the plan – estimated to cost as much as £8,000. 

‘The badges will go in the bin, down the toilet or in the river,’ said one Commons official.

The badge plan has also caused anger because it will not apply to MPs themselves.

But senior Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg defended the proposal. 

He said: ‘The male chauvinists of the House of Commons who stare at women’s chests like latter-day Sid Jameses from 1970s Carry On films will do that anyway, with or without a name badge. It won’t make the rest of us behave in such an undignified way.’

A Commons spokesman said: ‘We are piloting the policy while conducting an equality analysis.’
