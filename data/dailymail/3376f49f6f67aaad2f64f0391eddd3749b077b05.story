They are a popular feature on cars across the country - bumper stickers ordered online that feature stick figure representations of family members and even pets.

They seem like harmless decal fun.

But authorities are now warning that 'My Family' stickers can give away too much personal information, and may make you a target for creative criminals looking for their next hit.

With around 75 per cent of burglaries occurring in residential areas, police say some stickers, such as ones saying 'army dad' or showing children playing sports, make your home life and movements vulnerable to thieves.

Too much information? Authorities have sent out a warning to family's who may be - unwittingly - sharing key details about their home life and movements on their bumper stickers to thieves who are looking at new ways of picking their targets

Backlash: The creators of My Family stickers, Monica Liebenow and husband Phil Barham, pictured, have defended their product after U.S. police issued a safety warning about revealing private information

Similarly, a rear-vision mirror parking permit may tell someone where you live or work.

Florida resident Kathleen Wiggins said the warnings have made her realize she has a sticker showing her husband is a marine.

A clever crook may interpret that as knowing she is often home alone.

The sticker also shows she has young children and a small dog.

'That does really worry me,' she told News West 9.

Police say having bumper stickers about where your kid goes to school is another way to inform people of where you'll be dropping your child off. 

If your kids are involved in sports, it will tell them you're probably not home in the afternoons.

However, the creator of the 'My Family' sticker series, Australian Monica Liebenow, has rubbished the warnings.

'They are harmless stickers and they are put on cars with a great intention by people who want to express their family pride,' she said.

'I really don't think that is how any would-be robber is going to figure out their next victim,' she said.

'I’m sure they would have more sophisticated ways of doing that.'

Ms Liebenow and her husband Phil Barham started the company in 2009 and the mother-of-four said the ongoing success of the stickers proved they posed no dangers.

Urging critics to lighten up in their stance, Ms Liebenow said the stickers were a fun gesture that allowed people to express their family pride and some of their hobbies.

The range has been a huge success and Ms Ms Liebenow said the continued popularity was proof the stickers did not pose any danger

For those concerned about any possible threat the stickers may pose, the entrepreneur's advice is simple.

'If you're worried about it, don't put it on your car (and) if we're going to make assumptions about things, why can’t we just assume the best,' she said.

Ms Liebenow also added that the stickers were never intended to be taken seriously.

Bond University criminologist and former police officer Terry Goldsworthy said the stickers were similar to sharing information on social media and that there was some risk to sharing private information publicly.

Mr Golsworthy said there was always the possibility that someone could use the for ulterior motives.

He
 gave the example of a young attractive girl being seen getting into a 
car with a sticker of her and a dog. In the absence of a male sticker, 
it could be assumed there is no man in her life, making her a target for
 someone to follow.

'Then
 they know your family structure, your car and where you live so while 
by themselves the stickers may not be of importance, together it can all
 add up,' he said.

The FBI reported that in 2012 there were over two million burglaries in the US , almost 75 percent were residential burglaries.
