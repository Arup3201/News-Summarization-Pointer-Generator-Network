Household name retail chains closed stores at a rate of 32 a day over the summer in a dramatic escalation of the crisis on the nation’s high streets.

There were 953 more shop closures than openings among large chains in the first half of 2012, which compares to a net fall of 174 for the whole of 2011.

The figures will raise the spectre of yet more urban centres becoming ‘ghost towns’ as shoppers cut spending during the recession and switch to shopping online.

Ghost towns: Household name retail chains closed stores at a rate of 32 a day over the summer

While industry analysts predict hundreds more shops, both large chain and independent outlets, are set to put up the shutters.

Specialist toy shops, fashion outlets, jewellers, furniture stores, greetings card and poster shops are all falling in numbers.

Big chains like Clintons, Game, Peacocks and JJB have either disappeared completely or have lost hundreds of outlets.

While town centres are seeing more pawnbrokers, bookmakers, charity shops, coffee shops and convenience stores run by the ‘big four’ supermarkets.

The figures suggest government pledges to tackle high street decline and the decision to hire ‘Queen of Shops’ Mary Portas to devise a rescue plan have little chances of success.

Miss Portas has admitted that a number of high streets are beyond saving and town centres need to be switched to other uses such as housing, schools, gyms and community facilities.

Even the major supermarkets, such as Tesco, have admitted that the rush to build vast new shopping barns is over against the background of the rise of internet shopping.

Tesco has talked about trying to sell off some of its large Extra stores and rent out space in others.

Insolvency expert Mike Jervis, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, who compiled the figures in partnership with the Local Data Company, said: ‘All retailers in distress have too many locations. The insolvencies of Game, Peacocks and Clintons demonstrated this in spades.

‘Relatively long leases, with 
inflexible terms, have been entered into in a growth phase of the 
economy which is no longer appropriate.

‘Where
over-expansion has already taken place, retailers need to face that 
reality and formulate a strategic plan in partnership with landlords, 
not in confrontation with them.

‘There are sophisticated tools to analyse the extent to which sales from closed stores migrate to a retailer’s other locations. Properly managed, a large part of the lost sales can be regained.

‘Retail is increasingly becoming a partnership between the store group, its suppliers and the owners of its locations. Like any partnership which falls on hard times, dialogue involving all partners is key.’

Matthew Hopkinson, director of the Local Data Company, warned hundreds of more stores will close.

He said: ‘This rapid increase in the drawdown of the multiple retailers in the first half of this year is not unexpected.

‘It also has some way to go as consumer spend remains low and the omni-channel environment requires fewer but larger and more ‘dynamic’ stores.

‘The departure of so many larger stores is a major issue for many town centres, especially in secondary centres, where they have for many years been their high street’s anchors.

‘A similar slowing in growth of the independents combined with this multiples drawdown has significant consequences beyond just driving vacancy rates up for many of these town centres.’

A new Which? survey identifying the UK’s best online shops has placed the beauty products website LizEarle.com at number one, ahead of John Lewis and Amazon. By contrast PCWorld.co.uk came in last place.

Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘With household budgets squeezed, it’s no surprise that many more consumers are doing more of their shopping online, with seven out of ten people saying they shop online for cheaper prices.

‘But it’s clear some online retailers need to raise their game, with people complaining of delays with deliveries, faulty items and poor stock availability.

‘Although we’ve found many are providing excellent customer service, we want to see the rest not only meeting the minimum fair trading rules but catching up with the best.’
