The leader of Thailand's military junta has warned protesters, the media and political rivals not to 'criticize' or 'start problems' after being officially endorsed by the country's king.

Dressed in a crisp white military uniform, General Prayuth Chan-ocha said the country faced a return 'to the old days' if opposition figures continued to incite division.

His comments came at a news conference at the army headquarters in Bangkok just after King 
Bhumibol Adulyadej endorsed Prayuth to run the country in a royal command 
that called for 'reconciliation among the people'.

Speaking to assembled media, Prayuth said he and was concerned about increasingly violent confrontations between the ousted government and dispersed demonstrators.

Prayuth also justified the putsch that was declared last Thursday, saying he had to restore order after seven months of violent confrontations and political turmoil between the now-ousted government and demonstrators who had called repeatedly for the army to intervene.

'The most important thing right now is to keep peace and order in the country... When the conflict intensified, and there was the threat of violence, we had to act', he said.

In sporadic violence since last November, 28 people have been killed and more than 800 injured in grenade attacks, gun fights and drive-by shootings. 

'I am not here to argue with anyone. Our intentions are pure, and we will remain transparent ... everyone needs to help me,' Prayuth added.

'Do not criticize, do not start problems. It's no use,' he went on to say.

Since last week, the military has sought to limit the protests by detaining figures who might play leadership roles.

The junta has defended the detentions of former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, most of the deposed government's Cabinet, and dozens of politicians and activists. 

It also has ordered dozens of outspoken activists, academics and journalists to report to military authorities.

More than 200 - the majority considered opponents of the new regime - have been officially summoned so far in lists broadcast on radio and TV. 

The fate of Yingluck, who surrendered herself Friday, and many others remains unclear. Some detainees have been released, and the military has said it expects to free most after about a week. 

Prayuth said the media must 'control your message. Anyone who posts on Facebook that incites, I consider that against the peace of the country'.

'Do you really want to go back to the old days? Right now there are people coming out to protest... Do your really want to go back? If so, I will have to enforce the law,' he added.
