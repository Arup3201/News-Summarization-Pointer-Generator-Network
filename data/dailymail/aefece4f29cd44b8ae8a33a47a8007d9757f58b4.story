Poole Town manager Tom Killick decided to watch his side's match against Cambridge City from the window of a nearby house after being hit with a six-match stadium ban.

Killick, who was handed a lengthy ban after admitting a Football Association charge relating to his conduct, ensured he watched Poole's 3-2 win on Saturday by peering out of the window of a house belonging to the club's groundsman.

Luckily for the Evo-Stik Southern boss, Poole's groundsman lives just yards away from the club's home ground.

The Poole boss, speaking to the Bournemouth Echo, said of his view: 'I can pretty much see the whole pitch apart from the goalmouth at the end I watch it from. It is quite a good vantage point but being detached from the players makes life difficult.

'I did not realise the significance of it at first, it just did not sink in. It is only the passage of time and games that makes you fully understand what it involves and just how much you miss.

'Thankfully, James (Wood, assistant manager), Robbie (Yates, goalkeeper coach) and the players have been relatively unaffected by it so they deserve all the credit. The personal difficulty for me is secondary.'

Killick, who was given a six-match stadium ban for remonstrating with referee Ben Knight following Dolphins' 1-0 defeat by Redditch on January 17, has just one game left to serve of his punishment.

He will be hoping for a similar vantage point on Tuesday when Poole take on Corby Town in the second leg of the Southern League Cup final.
