This was the chilling moment when a female shop worker stared down the barrel of a sawn-off shotgun before being smashed in the face with the firearm during a terrifying armed robbery.

Disturbing CCTV footage showed the young cashier freezing on the spot as the hooded gunman casually walked into the Co-op store in Rugby, Warwickshire, and pointed the weapon at her face.

Moments later, the robber - with a scarf concealing his face - could be seen slamming the barrel of the gun into the eye of the unidentified woman, causing her to collapse to the ground in agony.
