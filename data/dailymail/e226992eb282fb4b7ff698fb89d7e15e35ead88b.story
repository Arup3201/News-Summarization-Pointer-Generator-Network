With a successful designer for a mother and a fashion icon father, the four Beckham children have an unmatched pedigree when it comes to style.

So perhaps it should come as no surprise that the stylish six have been crowned the coolest celebrity clan in the world, courtesy of 28 per cent of those polled for a new survey.

Snapping at their (beautifully shod) heels in second place were the Kardashians with 16 per cent of the vote, closely followed by the Knowles-Carter family.

They shoot, they score! The Beckhams were named the most stylish celebrity clan on the planet

Fourth place was handed to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, with respondents citing Kate's impeccable dress sense and Prince George's immaculate ensembles.

The Duke, however, didn't fare so well with his normcore uniform of jeans, polo shirts and pullovers resulting in their relatively lowly finish.

Close behind the royal couple was the Wright family, made famous by reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex.

Elliot,
 Jess and the rest of the crew impressed voters with their savvy style nous - among them OAP Nanny Pat - which resulted in a 10 per cent share of the vote 
and a fifth place finish.

Hollywood superstar Will Smith and his brood came next taking sixth place with six per cent of the vote.

According to those questioned, Will's impeccable suits combined with wife Jada Pinkett’s quirky  fashion sense equalled a very stylish couple.

In seventh place was the second footballer on the list, Wayne Rooney, with respondents agreeing that wife Coleen had got the WAG look down to a tee.

However, those polled did feel that Wayne was letting the side down with his uninspiring clothing choices, which resulted in a modest six per cent of the vote and a bottom half finish.

Third place: Jay-Z, Beyonce and Blue Ivy were stylish enough to garner a top three finish in the poll

In eighth and ninth place were the Minogues closely followed by Rochelle and Marvin Humes who scored four and two per cent respectively.

Glamourous football and fashion couple Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy came in last with respondents awarding them one per cent of the vote.

One woman who took part in the survey said: 'The Beckhams just have this effortless style that lots of people would die for.

'They all always look fabulous wherever they are - even the little ones. Clearly Victoria’s fashionista influence has paid off.'

Another added: 'The Kardashians are the most stylish family for me. I love Kim’s quirky style, and her sisters always look great.

'Now that Kim has a little one I can’t wait to see what cute outfits she has lined up for her daughter to make front page news in.' 

A spokesperson for My1stYears, the company behind the survey, said: 'I think the respondents definitely have it right when crowning the most stylish family.

'The Beckhams always look great, and that’s partly because they don’t seem to try too hard. They look like your average, albeit extremely well dressed, family which is what makes them so popular.'
