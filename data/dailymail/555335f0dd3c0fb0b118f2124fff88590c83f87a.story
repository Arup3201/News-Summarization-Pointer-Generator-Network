Mission accomplished! A group of rocket enthusiasts launched a porta-potty into the sky Saturday in southwestern Michigan. 

It made an arc and almost landed on a spectator's pickup truck, 2,000 feet away.

A group of Michiana Rocketry club members planned the project for more than two years. The club is trying to increase awareness of rocketry as a hobby and prove it's possible to turn a porta-potty into a rocket and launch it successfully.

Blastoff: Members of the Michiana Rocketry launch a 10-foot, 450 pound porta-potty, mounted on rocket motors on Saturday 

Amazing start: The porta-potty has more than one use as proven by a group of engineers who created a rocket out of one that launched on Saturday 

Descent: Parachutes slow down the descent of a 10-foot, 450 pound porta-potty, mounted on rocket motors on Saturday in Michigan 

Holy smokes: The rocketeers who successfully launched the potty wanted to turn an ordinary object into something extrordinary

The rocket stoands at 10-feet tall and weighs 450 pounds.  

The Herald Palladium newspaper says liftoff occurred in a soybean field near Three Oaks in Berrien County. About 30 people worked on the rocket, from engineers to sales people who lined up sponsors.

Rocket enthusiast Bob Bycraft says it was carefully planned. He says it wasn't 'barnyard engineering.'

WSBT reported that this rocket project was undertaken by a group of experienced high power rocketeers to prove that with skilled techniques, engineering and testing, an underappreciated every day object like a porta-potty can fly like a rocket.

There have been attempts by othe rocketeers in the past, but according to project leader Larry Kingman, 'I have yet to see a successful flight of a full sized Port a Potty rocket,' says a news release from the group named The Throne Thrusters.

Smooth landing: Just inches away from a vehicle, spectators photograph the landing of a 10-foot, 450 pound porta-potty, launched on rocket motors

Before the launch: Members of the Michiana Rocketry prep a 10-foot, 450 pound porta-potty, mounted on rocket motors for launching on Saturday

Hoisted: Erin Colton jokes around as she sits in a porta-potty before the Chasing Santa 5K, where hundreds of runners dressed as Santa Clause for the race that started in America the Beautiful Park on Saturday
