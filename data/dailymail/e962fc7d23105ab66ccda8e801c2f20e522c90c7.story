A farm worker who killed a beauty therapy student in a horrific car crash after he fell asleep at the wheel made a sick joke about her death on the day he was jailed for seven years.

Matthew Norcott, 27, had been up for two days on ecstasy when he ploughed his Ford Fiesta into a central reservation at 83mph leaving 17-year-old Lara Smith with fatal injuries.

Yesterday, hours before a judge jailed him for seven-and-a-half years at Luton Crown Court, he wrote on his Facebook wall: 'Well I ve always
got a buzz out of putting my self in situations Wher I’m out of my 
depth well today Is the king of all those days.

Death: Matthew Norcott, 27, left, had been up for two 
days on ecstasy when he ploughed his Ford Fiesta into a central 
reservation at 83mph leaving 17-year-old beauty therapy student Lara Smith, right, with fatal injuries

'Time to put my head at rest and 
finally get some peace Lots of time to rest my mind hope your all their 
with me today I know u will be Lara, uncle Ruffus, Kirsty & warren, 
Phil, grandad, uncle Ian, Mr murphy, nicky c, uncle Bob and all the rest
of you I know you ll all be looking down on me just like ill be looking
up at you each and everyone xxxx.'

Lara was rushed to hospital after the
crash in November last year but died four hours later while two other men, who were also in 
the car, escaped with minor injuries.

Norcott was arrested at the scene and officers found 13 ecstasy tablets on him. He later admitted he had had just five-and-a-half hours sleep in the previous 47 hours after partying with friends.

Just two days later he took to Facebook to post pictures of his
injuries and brag about them. 

He wrote: 'Funny looking elbow looks more like a knee can actually see the metal plates in my arm f***ing tin arm.'

He also posted: 'The new war wound who needs a tattoo to remember a bad time this one is with me for life.'

Callously, he even posted a picture of
himself wearing a hospital gown, next to the words: 'Oh Lala [sic] 
would nt u have laughed at me at this point in time stockins paper pants
and a backless gown xxx priceless.'

Norcott admitted causing death by careless driving while unfit through drugs and possessing class A drugs with intent to supply.

Tests showed he had 0.32mg of ecstasy per litre of blood which was a 'reasonably high amount,' the court heard.

Examinations of Norcott’s mobile phone showed he had been organising drug deals by text before the crash.

Judge Michael Baker told him: 'No sentence could replace a life which was immeasurably valuable.'

The
court heard how Lara, a beauty therapist described as 'perfect' by her 
teachers, was in the car with Norcott, who was a family friend, on 
November 13 last year.

Inappropriate: Just days after the crash Norcott posted pictures of his 
injuries on Facebook, right, and bragged about them. He posted this picture of him in a gown and said 'Lara wouldn't have laughed at me'

The pair, along with friends Jack Brant and John Long, were driving along the A421 at Lidlington, Bedfordshire at 6.50am when the car smashed into the central reservation.

The car span off the road and rolled up to six times before sliding into a ditch.

Lara, from Peopleton, near Pershore, Worcestershire, was rushed to Bedford Southwing Hospital but died hours later.

The former Pershore High School pupil and had been a student at Worcester College of Technology.

She had been crowned student of the year by her tutor group and excelled at her beauty therapy course.

Her tutor Sarah Beazley said: 'Lara was the perfect student, always working hard, popular with fellow students and staff.'

Close: Norcott, pictured in these Facebook photos, was a family friend of Lara's and used to babysit for her

The court heard Norcott was a family friend of Lara’s and used to babysit for her when he was a teenager.

On the night of the crash Norcott’s girlfriend had driven him and his friend Mr Brant to a party in Bristol.

He drove back to his home in Pershore, arriving at 4am where he dropped his girlfriend off before picking up Mr Long and Lara.

They then headed towards an all-night party at Baldock in Hertfordshire.

Peter Shaw, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Brant heard someone from the back shouting and he turned to look out to see the car veering across the lanes towards the crash barrier.

Injuries: Norcott shows off his injured arm on the social networking site. His solictor said he feels so guilt-ridden he has since raised £1,500 in Lara's memory and said he deserved a jail sentence

'He looked at the defendant and saw his head hanging down and apparently asleep. Mr Brant tried to grab hold of the steering wheel. However, the car hit the central reservation.'

The court heard Norcott, who worked as a farm worker and builder, had five previous convictions for 11 offences and three cautions, including driving with excess alcohol and driving while disqualified, possessing ecstasy and having no insurance.

Derek Johashen, defending, told the court Norcott 'remembered holding her [Lara] as a baby when he was 10 years old.'

He added: 'He says he deserves to go to custody. He treated her as a younger sister he never had. His own ridiculously bad behaviour led to her demise.'

The court also heard that Norcott feels so guilt-ridden he has since raised £1,500 in Lara’s memory.
