A doctor who is accused of taking advantage of 'desperate' cancer patients will have to justify his actions before a 'fitness to practise' panel.

Doctor Julian Kenyon is facing a fitness to practise hearing after allegedly misleading cancer patients on the effectiveness of a treatment

Dr Julian Kenyon claimed his Sono Photo Dynamic Therapy (SPDT), which uses sonar and light, could kill tumour cells in 80 per of late-stage cancer patients, a tribunal heard today.

For the a 20-minute treatment session, Dr Kenyon charged a rate of £300.

The unconventional method is generally a last resort when other treatments fail, a representative of the GMC told the tribunal today.

Dr Kenyon also told a patient that the treatment was more effective than traditional chemotherapy, it is alleged.

The complementary medicine practitioner offered the ‘novel approach’ to one patient during a 20 minute consultation, at the Dove Clinic’s Wimpole Street consulting rooms, in Marylebone, central London.

He also told an undercover reporter from The Sunday Times that the rate of ‘complete responses’, or long-term survivors, following the treatment, was just under 10 per cent.

The journalist posed as a cancer patient’s husband in December 2012.

Dr Kenyon, who trained in general medicine, is facing a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester. The hearing began today and has been listed for 10 days.

Dr Kenyon admits making the assertions, but denies any of his conduct was dishonest or misleading.

The General Medical Council (GMC) alleges that Dr Kenyon overstated the effectiveness of the treatment - without enough evidence to support his claims.

Ben Fitzgerald, for the GMC, said: ‘Dr Julian Kenyon faces an allegation that his fitness to practise is impaired by reason of his misconduct.

‘The misconduct in question concerns Dr Kenyon’s misleading statements made in late 2012 to two individuals, one a genuine patient with advanced cancer and the other an undercover reporter posing as the husband of a woman with advanced cancer, about the effectiveness of a private medical treatment he was offering to provide.’During treatment, a patient is given a ‘sensitiser’ then exposed to a light bed and a hand-held ultrasound device, the hearing was told.

This is said to activate the sensitiser within the tumour site and kill cancer cells as well as provoking an immune response within the patient, the panel heard.

SPDT is a development of a conventionally accepted treatment, Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), which uses light alone to activate the sensitiser for tumours lying on or close to the skin.

SPDT is said to have the ability to penetrate deeper into the body than some treatments.

Mr Fitzgerald said: ‘The GMC’s case is that SPDT is indeed a novel form of treatment and one in respect of which the evidence of effectiveness is, and was in 2012, extremely limited.

‘It is also the kind of unconventional private treatment that patients with advanced and serious forms of cancer may turn to, in a state of some desperation, after the failure of conventional forms of treatment to address their condition.

‘In this context it is essential that any doctor offering the treatment should provide accurate and non-misleading information about the evidence of its effectiveness.

‘The GMC alleges that Dr Kenyon’s statements about SPDT were misleading, because they had the effect of overstating the evidence of its effectiveness without drawing attention sufficiently to the limitations of the evidence.’

Mr Fitzgerald told the panel that while Dr Kenyon appears to be a genuine enthusiast of the new treatment which may prove to be effective, his knowledge of the evidence available at the time meant that the picture he painted of the service was not justified.

‘Accordingly, it is alleged that Dr Kenyon’s conduct was dishonest as well as simply misleading,’ he added.

The Dove Clinic on Wimpole Street where Dr Kenyon is alleged to have 'misled' patients over the effectiveness of a novel cancer treatment

A man in the late stages of cancer, known only as Patient A, consulted Dr Kenyon in September 2013 after researching alternative therapies.

The patient has since died from the illness, but was recommended SPDT by Dr Kenyon to treat the disease.

The medic is alleged to have said ‘there is a strong possibility that we would be able to increase your median survival time’.

Dr Kenyon did make it clear that it was not a cure, but an experimental treatment which needed further trials, but did say there was a ‘strong possibility’ of extending the patient’s life.

‘Patient A was a man with advanced cancer who was seeking assistance from alternative therapies in a desperate situation,’ Mr Fitzgerald said.

‘Dr Kenyon’s statement regarding his survival time, whether considered on its own or in the context of all the other communication with Patient A, was misleading.’Reporter Jonathan Ungoed-Thomas posed as the husband of a woman suffering from breast cancer during a meeting with Dr Kenyon in December 2012, during which he raised the subject of SPDT.

Dr Kenyon explained the theory before telling him: ‘You don’t have to belong to a religion to believe in it. It’s not some wacky idea.’

He went on to say it was more effective than chemotherapy in similar cases claiming it resulted in ‘significant tumour cell death’ in 80 per cent of patients.

He also suggested the rate of long-term survivors was just under 10 per cent.

Dr Kenyon also repeated the key claims in later correspondence with Mr Ungoed-Thomas once he had revealed he was a journalist.

Dr Kenyon maintains the treatment is effective and denies his actions were dishonest or misleading.

In his witness statement he said: ‘I deny ever acting in a deliberately misleading or dishonest way towards anybody during the course of a consultation, whether a bona fide patient or otherwise’.

Dr Kenyon runs The Dove Clinic, in Twyford, Hampshire and also has consulting rooms in Wimpole Street, central London.
