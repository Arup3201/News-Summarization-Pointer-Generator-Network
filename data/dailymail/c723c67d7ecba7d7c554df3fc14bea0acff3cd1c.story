Arsene Wenger has praised Louis van Gaal's performance at the 2014 World Cup and backed Manchester United to challenge for the Premier League title under the Dutchman's leadership.

United finished seventh last season under David Moyes but Van Gaal has already begun to put his mark on the club by completing the signings of Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw.

The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager has also guided Holland to the semi-finals of the World Cup and overseen an impressive 5-1 victory against holders Spain as well as making game-changing substitutions in the second round and quarter-final wins against Mexico and Costa Rica.

Wenger, working as a pundit for French television, has been impressed by what he has seen and welcomed Van Gaal's arrival in the Premier League.

He said: 'I think he is going to be a fantastic manager in the Premier League.

'I liked how the decisions he made were clear, how the timing of his decisions were always right and in my opinion it was the right decision every time.

'I am sure that Manchester United will be competitors this year for the championship and that will be more interesting.

'Because he can beat maybe Arsenal but then he might lose to Chelsea, then you've got Manchester City as well as Liverpool. So yes, it's going to be an interesting league.'

In Holland's quarter-final win against Costa Rica, Van Gaal substituted goalkeeper Jasper Cillesen for Tim Krul moments before the penalty shooutout.

The decision paid off with Krul saving two spot-kicks and Wenger admired his counterpart's intelligence.

He said 'I think it was a decision that was meant to impact psychologically on the penalty takers on the other team and on that front, it was a clever decision.'
