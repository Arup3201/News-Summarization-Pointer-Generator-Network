Robert Huth is out of Stoke’s Capital One Cup clash against Southampton on Wednesday night after suffering a calf injury that could prove ‘significant’.

It is a blow for the German defender who was battling for a place having overcome a long-term knee problem.

There are fears he is set for up to a month on the sidelines after picking up the injury in training. Stoke are awaiting the results of a scan.

'Robert Huth trained yesterday and got a knock,' said assistant manager Mark Bowen. 'He's gone for a scan and could be out for a few weeks which would be disappointing.

'Robert walked in and said that his calf was really sore. I don't personally know the outcome yet but it didn't look too good for him.

'All the fans know what a warrior he is, he wants to play on through niggles. Maybe that’s to his detriment. If it is a significant injury it’s come at a bad time.’
