England and Saracens centre Brad Barritt faces four weeks on the sidelines after damaging his calf during the final QBE international against Australia.

Barritt, who finished the match resembling a prize fighter following a clash of heads with Wallaby winger Rob Horne, suffered a calf injury which is expected to keep him out until the New Year.

Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘Brad pulled his calf in the last game for England.

‘It’s obviously hugely disappointing for us to lose him for four weeks when he comes back with a pretty significant injury like that. But that’s life. We just roll on.’

Barritt missed Saracens’ hard-fought 19-15 European Champions Cup victory at Sale on Saturday as McCall’s men kept their Pool 1 hopes alive.

Owen Farrell started at inside centre and scored a first-half try and an important 65th- minute drop goal before Chris Ashton averted a late Sale surge with a crucial turnover.

Winless Sale, whose European hopes are now over, travel to Allianz Park next Saturday when victory for the home side will leave them needing to beat Munster and Clermont to be certain of qualification.

England's world champion women came down to earth with a bump as they lost in the quarter-final of the Sevens World Series before going on to win the Plate competition.

In their first major event since turning professional, England beat Fiji in the Plate final but try-scorer Natasha Hunt admitted after the Dubai tournament: ‘We were so disappointed to be knocked out in the quarters because ultimately we came here to win.’

British and Irish Lion Dan Lydiate is set to return to Wales this week following an unsuccessful spell at Racing Metro, with the blindside flanker reported to have signed a £1million deal to join the Ospreys. 

The Welsh Rugby Union are understood to be ready to pay 60 per cent of Lydiate’s salary as he returns following 18 months that saw him fail to settle in Paris.

Leinster head coach Matt O’Connor insists rugby is overwhelmingly clean following RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie’s admission that there is ‘a problem’ around doping in the sport.

Rugby has more players banned for doping than any other sport in the UK, although these have almost exclusively been in the amateur game, where the RFU are adamant the issue is most prevalent.

A Mail on Sunday investigation yesterday published anonymous claims from a former international coach stating he had witnessed ‘institutionalised doping’ in the game.

Leinster head coach Matt O’Connor has denied that doping is a major problem in the sport 

But former Leicester coach O’Connor denies there is a problem, saying: ‘We would have drug testers in our environment if not every week, every other week.

‘I’ve never come across anything that would indicate that we have an issue in our game.’
