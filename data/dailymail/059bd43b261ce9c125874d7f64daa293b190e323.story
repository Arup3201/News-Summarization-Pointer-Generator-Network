Four US servicemen have been wounded after their helicopter was shot at during an evacuation mission in South Sudan.

The men had been trying to rescue American citizens following outbreaks of violence in Bor, the capital of the state of Jonglei, today.

But their mission was hindered when they were hit by incoming gunfire - leaving one critically injured and three others wounded.

The aircraft turned around after being fired at, before heading to Kampala in Uganda, according to US officials.

From there, the wounded servicemen were flown to Nairobi in Kenya for medical treatment.

It is believed to be the second helicopter to have been shot at in Jonglei this week.

On Friday, a UN helicopter trying to evacuate peacekeepers and civilians in the state was fired on, causing 'significant' damage, according to two US officials.

Rob McKee, of Warrior Security, said the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing after suffering small arms fire while trying to evacuate personnel from a base in Yuai.

A second official - who wishes to remain unnamed - said the helicopter was abandoned and remains unable to fly.

However, no injuries have so far been reported.

Warning: Yesterday, President Barack Obama said South Sudan 'stands on the precipice' of civil war

South Sudan has seen some of the its worst ever violence over the past week - claiming at least 500 lives so far.

The US military has dispatched 45 troops to protect its embassy in the capital of Juba, while the State Department has warned American citizens in the country to leave immediately.

Hundreds of people are believed to be trapped in Bor, which is currently in hands of rebels.

Meanwhile, thousands of others have fled to UN compounds to seek shelter from the violence.

The conflict began on Sunday when troops loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire at a government meeting in an attempt to force President Salva Kiir from power.

Machar was sacked along with the entire rest of the cabinet in July after announcing he was going to contest the 2015 general election.

Yesterday, President Barack Obama said the country 'stands on the precipice' of civil war as conflict in the country entered its sixth day.

In a statement, he said: 'In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people.

'In recent years, against great odds, South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history.

'Today, that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past.'

A number of other nations, including Britain, have sent in military troops to rescue their civilians.
