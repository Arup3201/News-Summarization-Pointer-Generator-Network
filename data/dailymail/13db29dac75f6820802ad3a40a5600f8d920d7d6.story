When Samuel Johnson's sister set him the challenge to unicycle more than 15,000km around Australia to raise awareness for breast cancer, there was no way he could refuse.

The 36-year-old former Secret Life of Us actor, who currently lives in Melbourne, had spent his whole life supporting his sister Connie, 37, who has battled cancer on three separate occasions.

But Connie, a mother-of-two who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only six months to live, had more in mind than just simply raising $1 million for the Garvan Institute of Medical Research – she wanted to save her brother. 

Samuel and Connie Johnson started the Love Your Sister campaign in an effort to raise money for breast cancer research and encourage women to check their breasts 

Connie also designed the campaign, which would see her younger brother unicycle around Australia, to make sure Sam, who had been suffering from depression and addiction, was OK when she died

'Connie designed Love Your Sister not just to raise awareness for breast cancer, but to put me on the right track before she died – it was her devious attempt to fix me up,' Samuel told Daily Mail Australia.

Samuel, who had lost his girlfriend to suicide in 2006, was suffering from depression and addiction when Connie was told that her breast cancer had spread to her liver, pelvis, spine and knee.

'I've always been her problematic brother and I suppose I wasn't doing too well when she got sick,' he said.

'I just wasn't the happiest I can be and I wasn't trying to be the best person I could be - I was kind of just distracted by the miscreant in me and her terminal diagnosis was a great wakeup call and she was determined that I find some of the happiness that she found in life,' he said.

As far as siblings go, Connie and Samuel were like two peas in a pod, despite Samuel describing their childhood relationship as 'a tempestuous bond'. 

Connie's whole life has been dominated by cancer since she was first diagnosed with a rare aggressive bone tumour at 11-years-old

At 22, she was diagnosed with cancer again after a tumour was found in her womb. Four years ago, the mother-of-two found out she had breast cancer which had spread to her liver, pelvis, spine and knee

Together, they've been through more than most. After losing their mother to suicide at a young age, Connie was diagnosed with a rare aggressive bone tumour at 11-years-old. 

At 22, she was diagnosed with cancer again after a tumour was found in her womb. 

After beating both illnesses, Connie was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago and, after initial tests said she had won that fight too, later assessments revealed that the cancer had spread all over her body, rendering her condition 'terminal'.

'My childhood memories kick in on the day my dad told me that my sister had cancer - I don't really remember a time when Connie wasn't fighting cancer. It has dominated her life,' Samuel said.

The campaign saw Samuel break the world record for the longest distance travelled on a unicycle

Samuel farewells Connie before his Australia-wide trip: The 36-year-old rode over 15,000km around the country in just under a year and raised over $1.9 million for cancer research

'After decades of fighting and winning, she's been told now that she's going to lose after all that effort.

'Luckily, Connie has always had a great thirst for life. In the immediate aftermath of her terminal diagnosis, she decided she wanted to prevent other young mums from experiencing exactly what she was going through.'

And so the Love Your Sister campaign was born and Samuel found himself breaking the world record for the longest distance travelled on a unicycle by riding over 15,000km around the country in just under a year. 

Sam said he 'cycled into every town, jumped on my pink soapbox and screamed the message out to anyone that would listen' - from juvenile justice centres, nursing homes and bikie gangs to the more standard fare of schools, community events, gala balls and grass-roots fundraisers

The duo have also released a book, a part memoir for Connie, about Samuel's adventures and Connie's life-long cancer battle 

He raised over $1.9 million for breast cancer research during the campaign, in which he says he 'cycled into every town, jumped on my pink soapbox and screamed the message out to anyone that would listen' - from juvenile justice centres, nursing homes and bikie gangs to the more standard fare of schools, community events, gala balls and grass-root fundraisers.

Connie and Samuel have also written a book about their life adventure together, a part memoir for Connie, which was released just last week.

But they're not done yet. The siblings have admitted that they are currently concreting plans to unicycle around New Zealand while also planning a secret fundraiser in Australia that Samuel describes as 'an epic fundraiser that would no doubt trump our efforts on the unicycle'.

'If Anh Do is reading this, I really want to unicycle New Zealand with him,' Samuel said of the Vietnamese born comedian and actor.

'He can even come on a two-wheeler, but I get bored out of my brain on that thing eight to nine hours a day and can't think of a better bloke to ride with.'

Since completing his challenge, Samuel admits that he considers himself a changed and lucky man, especially as his sister managed to buy some time with a hormone treatment that temporarily stabilised her condition.

'I've got a great hunger for life now, my curiosity has been reactivated and I'm finding great joy and optimism in saying "yes". I'm a better person because of my sister's illness and what she's decided to do about it,' Samuel said. 

'Connie has experienced a great year of stability, but the cancer is active again so things are going downhill a little. Obviously we are all, as always, alert and trying not to be alarmed.'
