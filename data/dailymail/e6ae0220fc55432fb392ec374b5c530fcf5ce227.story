A two-year-old boy will receive revolutionary treatment for his rare disease after a mystery benefactor donated £40,000. 

Kat Musgrove had 30 days to find £140,000 so her son Kian could fly to the U.S and have his neuroblastoma treated.

She was struggling to raise the final bit of money until an anonymous donor from Luxembourg stepped in.

Neuroblastoma is the cancer of specialised nerve cells, also known as neural crest cells.

It is the second most common childhood tumour. 

The symptoms range from tiredness to lack of appetite and pain in the bones. Most children who are diagnosed with the condition are younger than five years old.

Treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and antibody treatment.

Almost half of neuroblastoma cases are an aggressive form and, despite very intensive treatment, it has a high chance of returning. It affects around 100 children every year.  

The 27-year-old, from Newcastle, said: 'I can't believe it. There was a note with the money saying "good luck to your son".

'I still can't get my head around it. I keep looking to make sure the money is actually there.' 

Kian will fly to Michigan for the treatment on March 31. 

He was first diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma on October 31, 2013, after doctors discovered 27 tumours around his kidneys and in his bones.

Despite chemotherapy and numerous operations Kian still had an 80 per cent chance the cancer would return, doctors said. 

The new trial treatment - called DFMO - aims to prevent the cancer returning by stopping a certain cell that creates the neuroblastoma cell.

But it has to be started no later than 120 days after the patient has undergone their last bout of immunotherapy - and Kian's finished almost 100 days ago.

Ms Musgrove, who is in the process of booking her flights, said: 'I'm so excited by what has happened, people have just been incredible.

'I want this for Kian so much and I want this to work so badly.

'But I'm also scared. Scared because I'm flying over there alone, not knowing what the future is going to hold.'

Kian's family will continue to raise £500,000 for 'relapse therapy' in case the trial treatment does not work and the cancer returns. Above, mother and son are pictured together before the trip

Ms Musgrove added: 'I just hope this works for my little boy.'
