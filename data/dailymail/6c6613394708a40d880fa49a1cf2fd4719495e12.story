More than 60 cultural artifacts illegally smuggled into the U.S. from Iraq were returned to the Iraqi government during a ceremony  in Washington D.C. on Monday.

The move follows a culmination of investigations led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in New York, Baltimore, Austin, Texas, and New Haven, Connecticut.

Among the items salvaged were a gold-plated door knocker, water urn and soap dish  from Saddam Hussein's private airport and palace.

Investigators were alerted to the belongings when a source tipped them off that gold-plated artifacts from the former president's properties were on the market.

'They're invaluable to the host country,' said Bruce Foucart, the agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New England.

The artifacts were returned to their home country at a special event held at the Embassy of Iraq.

One of the most significant objects on show was the head of a statue representing King Sargon II.

The limestone carving was recovered in New York in 2008 by agents who broke up a smuggling ring operated by a dealer in Dubai.

In Iraq, the Islamic State group has destroyed a number of shrines and ancient artifacts in order to eliminate what they view as heresy.

Lukman Faily, Iraq's ambassador to the U.S., said Monday's ceremony sends a message to Islamic State that Iraq and its allies are committed to rebuilding the country and preserving its cultural heritage.

Faily said the return of the looted items is 'a national project and we call upon all countries to help us in preserving this heritage which is not only valuable for Iraq but for all mankind.'

The Smithsonian has trained a cadre of Homeland Security Investigations agents in how to research the provenance of cultural artifacts as they investigate smuggling.

The artifacts recovered by the New Haven, Connecticut-based agents were brought to the U.S. by a government contractor who handed them over when confronted by investigators, Foucart said. 

The investigation began with a tip in April 2012 and Foucart said his agents became involved because Connecticut was a possible destination for the items.

Among the other items recovered by multi-year investigations are an ancient bronze axe and 21 clay reliefs.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement unit has reportedly returned more than 1,200 items to Iraq in four repatriations since 2008.
