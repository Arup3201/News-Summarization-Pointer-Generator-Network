The UK will take a decade to close the ‘skills gap’ with other countries because too few students study science, engineering and maths.

So-called STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths - are essential to keep pace in the technological race that fuels the global economy today.

But 59 per cent of employers and 71 per cent of universities said there aren’t enough people being trained to the standard needed - and predicted it would take at least ten years to tackle the problem.

An overwhelming majority in both groups agreed the deficit had to be addressed for the UK to remain competitive.

The survey followed a damning report earlier this week which showed England is the only developed country where 16-24-year-olds are worse at maths and English than their grandparents.

Graduates from English universities are also less advanced than school leavers in some countries including Japan, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The report - which warned England was falling behind global competitors - destroyed Labour’s record on education during 13 years in power. Researchers even backed critics who said rising exam results had been caused by grade inflation rather than improving standards.

Further damage was done yesterday by Department for Education figures which revealed sixth forms and colleges had been failing pupils by allowing them to drop maths and English before they have achieved a decent grade at GCSE.

Deficit: A total of 71 per cent of universities said there aren¿t enough people being trained to the standard needed

In maths, 93 per cent of those without a C by the time they finished secondary school had still not achieved the grade by 18 if they stayed in education. Some 83 per cent were not made to continue the subject.

The figures in English were 92 per cent and 85 per cent respectively.

Education Secretary Michael Gove tackled the issue last month by announcing teenagers would have to keep trying to get a C in both subjects until they were 18.

More than half of the 300 businesses and 24 leading Russell Group academics who took part in the STEM survey said more money needed to be invested in teaching the subjects.

They also called for closer collaboration between industry and academia to improve take-up and for industry to have a greater say in the curriculum.

The number of undergraduates studying STEM subjects was 632,000 in 2011/12, an increase of 13.6 per cent over five years.

But a report by the Social Market Foundation think-tank earlier this year said this was not enough to meet demand.

An extra 40,000 graduates were needed each year to meet the 100,000 vacancies being created by the ageing workforce, it added.

Dr Coorous Mohtadi of computer software developer MathWorks, which commissioned the STEM survey, said: ‘This report tells us two important things.

‘First, that more needs to be done to encourage students to study STEM subjects in tertiary education.

‘Second, that STEM curricula need to better reflect the requirements of industry, bearing in mind that during their careers students will need to solve problems that are not yet known, using technologies that haven’t been invented yet.’

Demand from universities for students to study traditional subjects has led to an increase in applications to read subjects such as maths and science.

The Department for Business, Innovations and Skills has also set up a £200 million fund to boost science and engineering departments, under which universities are expected to match the funding.

A BIS spokeswoman said: ‘It is vital the UK has the skills we need to ensure our businesses stay ahead in the global race. That is why we recently announced a £400 million investment in world-class science and technology facilities and teaching for university students.

‘We are also encouraging more people to study STEM subjects at high level by reversing the rules which stopped them getting financial support to retrain in engineering and technology part-time.’
