A Minnesota zoo was on high alert Thursday morning when three gorillas were able to get out of an indoor enclosure.

St. Paul's Como Zoo said in a statement that its gorillas Samson, Jabir and Virgil slid out 'through an unsecured door behind the scenes of the indoor gorilla habitat' at 9:50am.

Making a break for it! Samson is one of three gorillas who got out of an indoor enclosure on Thursday morning

'The gorillas were always within the building and within gorilla proof barriers,' the statement said.

The zoo said Samson and Jabir were back in the indoor enclosure after 20 minutes - while Virgil was back after fifty minutes.

''He found the enrichment closet and he was playing with the boomer balls and throwing things around,' zookeeper Alison Jungheim told KARE.

She explained to CBSMinnesota that 'All we really had to do was wait for him to go into one of his habitats and we were able to secure him that way.'

'As we walked in they told us that there was an animal loose and and that we would not be allowed inside,' Connie Lenasa told the affiliate station. Visitors were told to wait in designated areas while the gorillas went back inside.

In the wake of Thursday's incident, parody Twitter account @ComoZooGorilla was launched, the Star-Tribune reported.

'I go where I want,' declared one humorous tweet.

Another read, 'Be the primate you want to see in the world.'

No one was harmed by Thursday's incident, Como Zoo said.
