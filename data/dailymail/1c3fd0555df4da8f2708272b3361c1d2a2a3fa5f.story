A ‘non-final’ press image of the HTC One Max, also known as the T6, has been leaked on the internet.

The image, posted by prolific tech tweeter @evleaks, is similar to those posted by the source before but provides far more detail as to what we might expect.

Engadget noted that the major changes are the camera flash position and a more distinct side trim.

HTC's hotly rumoured phablet is tipped to be called the HTC One Max, or perhaps the HTC T6. The leaked picture purported to show 'non-final artwork', but HTC exec Jeff Gordon said the image to deny they were real

 - 5.9 inch phablet

- 2GB of RAM

- 16GB of storage

- A notably smaller microSD slot

It added that release of the image may suggest that the HTC One Max could launch ‘relatively soon’, potentially at IFA 2013 in September.

However, HTC's senior global online communications manager Jeff Gordon posted a comment on Engadget that the image was fake.

‘Fake. @evleaks is way off his game,’ he said.

He added: ‘Me: Try to make a helpful comment on @engadget about the company I work for. Engadget commenter: “Get out of here, troll”.’

According to CNet, earlier rumours had suggested the One Max will be a 5.9-inch phablet, with 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and, notably, a microSD slot.

Last month HTC announced the HTC One mini, a compact version of the award winning HTC One.

The new addition to the family combines a 4.3 inch display and dual-core 1.4 GHz processor. It also runs the latest version of Android with HTC Sense.

Ahead of its launch, leaked pictures of the handset emerged suggesting the phone would have a 4.3 inch screen and come in black and white.

Leaked images of the HTC One Mini handset were released before the unveiling of the handset last month
