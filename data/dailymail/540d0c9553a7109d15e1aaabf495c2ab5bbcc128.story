It was the anthem which propelled Tony Blair into Number 10 with a landslide majority for New Labour.

But popstar-turned-astronomer Brian Cox admits he would not lend his smash hit song, Things Can Only Get Better, to help Ed Miliband's election bid.

The popular professor warned he cannot see a 'clear direction' from today's Labour party, in stark contrast to 1997 when 'everybody supported Blair'.

Brian Cox warned he cannot see a 'clear direction' from today's Labour party, in stark contrast to 1997 when 'everybody supported Blair'

In the 1990s Cox was the keyboardist with D:Ream, when the band allowed them to use their song in the run-up to the 1997 election.

It proved so popular that the Tories tried to stop Radio 1 playing the anthem because the band gave their royalties to the Labour party.

While Mr Miliband has sought to draw a line under the Blair era, Labour struggled has under Mr Miliband to get the public dancing to his tune. 

At his first conference speech after becoming leader, he walked on to stage to A-Punk by Vampire Weekend, but he has failed to find a signature song since.

Cox, pictured left in his popstar heyday, said he would say no if Ed Miliband asked to use one of his songs again

Now Cox has suggested Mr Miliband has failed to impress even those who backed Mr Blair two decades ago.

Asked if he would allow Things Can Only Get Better to be used by Labour again, he told the Standard: 'I'd probably say no to Labour using the song — there are immense pros and cons to all the parties and I can't quite see a clear direction. 

'It's very different now than in '97. In '97, it was obvious that everybody supported Blair. But now I think it's complicated, it's a muddy political climate. I'm sort of apolitical intentionally, because I'm rather a single-issue person, so it's definitely not clear-cut.'

He stresses that he has not decided which way to vote and would be influenced by the TV debates - if they happen. 

But asked if he is more of a fan of Blair than Miliband, he eventually conceded: 'In 1997, I would have said Tony, but I think Tony made some mistakes. So now I'd say Ed because Tony cocked up.' 

Things Can Only Get Better reached number one in 1994, and was re-released in 1997, when it climbed to 19 in the UK charts. 

The song became the soundtrack of New Labour's election victory in 1997 which propelled Tony Blair into Downing Street

Mr Miliband's leadership has come under increasing pressure in recent days, with senior party figures from the Blair era warning he is failing to make an impact ahead of the election on May 7.

Lord Mandelson warned Mr Miliband's plan to impose a mansion tax is 'crude' and would end up 'clobbering' people.

Lord Hutton and Mr Milburn, two senior Blairites, accused the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls of failing to defend the economic record of the last Labour government. 

Charles Clarke, a former Home Secretary who served in Tony Blair's Cabinet, said voters did not believe Labour would be any better than the coalition.

He told The Times: 'The reason why [minor parties have] gained support is because people don't think the Conservatives, Liberals are good and they are not confident enough that Labour will do better. 'Labour's challenge is to ensure that we convince people that we would do better.

Stuart Rose, who left M&S in 2010 after turning around the company's fortunes, has branded Ed Miliband a '1970s throwback', in a damning blow to the Labour party

'In a general way, I think that investment and reform, which was our slogan in the Blair years, is crucial. Certainly, the party has to campaign on the NHS, but it also has to campaign on education, which is another story of investment and reform.

'It has to campaign on transport, it has to campaign on policing and a whole set of other issues.'

Mr Miliband has also come under fire from business leaders, in stark contrast to the way Mr Blair wooed captains of industry to reassure them about a Labour government.

Former M&S boss Stuart Rose claimed Labour’s ‘business-bashing’ could curb investment and lead to ‘shuttered shop fronts, empty high streets and lengthening dole queues’.

His intervention is especially significant because he was handpicked by Gordon Brown to advise him directly as prime minister. 

It follows criticism from Boots chief Stefano Pessina who suggested a Labour government would be a catastrophe.

Mr Miliband has launched a fightback, vowing to 'stand up to these powerful forces' and accusing the Monaco-based Mr Pessina of being part of an 'unholy alliance' with the Conservatives against change.

Voters would not 'take kindly to being lectured by someone who is avoiding his taxes on how they should be voting in the UK general election', Mr Miliband suggested.

London mayor Boris Johnson defended Mr Pessina's right to speak out, but added it was 'disappointing' that he had moved Boots' HQ to Switzerland to reduce its tax liabilities - prompting Labour to challenge David Cameron and George Osborne to join in the criticism.

Meanwhile, shadow chancellor Ed Balls was attempting to build bridges with industry, saying that while there would always be some business leaders who took a 'political view' on issues including taxation, the majority would back the party's policies on infrastructure, education and remaining in the European Union.

Mr Balls, responding to claims that a 'bitter war of words' had erupted between his party and business, said: 'The reality is there's going to be some issues in any society which become very divisive politically, and understandably.

'The level of taxation that you levy at any point of time, there will always be different views on that, and whether or not we should have a health service which is predominantly free or whether people pay.

'These are big political issues. here are always going to be some people in every community, including the business community, who take a political view.'
