The mood appears to be merry in the Everton camp ahead of their visit to champions Manchester City on Saturday.

Samuel Eto'o and Kevin Mirallas traded football for a ping-pong ball as the two Toffees forwards went head-to-head in a game of table tennis.

Romelu Lukaku posted the video of the two competitors to his Instagram account as the pair performed a little dance after the game.

The 33-year-old will hope he has as much success at the Etihad on Saturday evening. 

Having had just one win in five games, Roberto Martinez said:'Stats are confusing. I could say we have only lost one in 10. This season has been intense. It has been very good in that we have been tested and pushed. 

'We probably haven’t got the points that we deserved but the first half of the season was about pushing ourselves. The margins have to be very small.'
