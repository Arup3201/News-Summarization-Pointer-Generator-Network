Gamers have discovered that the status of one of Grand Theft Auto V’s missions turns to ‘complete’ only when your character has blown up a Mark Zuckerberg doppelganger.

In the mission you must infiltrate the headquarters of Lifeinvader, the game’s Facebook parody, plant a bomb inside a mobile phone and make sure the device finds its way into the hands of the CEO, Jay Norris.

As Norris makes a landmark speech about Lifeinvader’s latest invention – a mobile phone – you can call the phone and bring his career to an explosive and grisly end.

Explosive ending: In GTA V one mission sees a character blowing up a Mark Zuckerberg lookalike

The sign sits outside the headquarters of Lifeinvader - Grand Theft Auto V's in-game parody of Facebook. During an early mission, players explore the offices of the social network site

Posters on the walls of Lifeinvader's offices. During one game scene, staff discuss how the site's CEO 'stole the site' from his co-founders - in reference to the claims made by the Winkelvoss brother's against Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg

Reports claim that Grand Theft Auto V has broken the record for the highest first-day sales of any video game, with world-wide sales of £500 million ($800 million) eclipsing the £310 million taken by Call of Duty: Black Ops II.

The game has certainly delivered the highest first day retail sales of any title sold by Take-Two Interactive Software, the parent company of the game's developer Rockstar.

Stores across the UK opened their doors at midnight on Tuesday for the special launch of the game, which reportedly cost around £170 million ($275 million) to make and market - more than films such as Avatar.

The fact that online retailer Amazon.co.uk sold-out of the game on pre-orders alone was one clue that it would be a record-breaker.

Since the series began in 1997, 135 million copies have been sold.

In the gruesome scene Norris says: ‘We
are about to make the next step. Prepare to witness the future: The 
Lifeinvader mobile device. We have invented something no one else has 
thought of. A small personal computerised device. Now you’re going to be
able to dock twenty-four seven.’

Moments later the device rings and blows up when Norris answers it, leading to mission success.

GTA V fans have found that the game is riddled with jokes about Facebook and the privacy concerns that many have about it.

Lifeinvader
comes with the taglines: 'The reason the world never gets anything done
any more' and 'Information isn't about imparting knowledge anymore. The
Internet changed all that.'

And
exploring Lifeinvader’s offices reveals a whiteboard with the 
statement: 'Remember! We aren't ripping them off if they don't read the 
T&Cs', with word ‘privacy’ crossed out.

What’s
more, gaming site Kotaku discovered that Rockstar has also launched a 
real-life version of Lifeinvader that lets players sign into using their
Social Club details.

The Social Club is Rockstar's community site.

For
people without a Social Club login, clicking the Lifeinvader icon in 
the top right-hand corner loads a series of example, spoof brand pages 
for armament companies, broadcasters, a drink called Sprunk, cigarettes 
and a barbers.

This Lifeinvader motto pokes fun at the privacy concerns raised by some Facebook users. In the game, the site is given the tagline: 'The reason the world never gets anything done any more'

One account, 
for Warstock Cache and Carry said: 'Whether you’re a private security 
company, paramilitary force, rebel militia, hot housewife, radical 
insurgent, unhinged lottery winner, over-zealous neighborhood watch 
group, or just a military hobbyist with a worrying amount of disposable 
income, we’ve got you covered.

'Our
online store is officially launching. Visit us anytime even from your 
iFruit phone at Warstock-Cache-And-Carry.com and shop for all your 
armored vehicle needs in the Los Santos area.'

'We know you appreciate being prepared, and so do we.

An example Lifeinvader account for armament firm Warstock Cache & Carry. As an extension of the in-game parody, Rockstar has also launched a real-life version of the site that lets players sign into using their Social Club details

'So
as a one-time special deal for all those who STALK our page here at 
LifeInvader, we’re happy to offer a 10% discount for your first purchase
of any armored vehicle at our online store when it launches this 
September.

'STALK now and stay tuned to our page to see some of the inventory we’ll have on offer.'

Stalking is the equivalent to Facebook's Like button and the iFruit reference pokes fun at Apple's iPhone.

There
is also a Twitter parody called Bleeter, in which users send bleets, 
and is described in-game as 'Bleeter is the perfect storm of blogging, 
social networking and text messaging. We're demolishing 100,000 years of
complex linguistic development 140 characters at a time.'

The white boards in one of the Lifeinvader rooms, pictured, read: 'Remember! We aren't ripping them off if they don't read the T&C' with word privacy crossed out. There is also the line 'No privacy = No lies'

The blue and green Bleeter site, that mimics the colour-scheme of Twitter, has the tagline: 'Life Suddenly Got Quick' with a sheep icon.

It is also described in-game as: 'Information isn't about imparting knowledge anymore. The Internet changed all that.

'Welcome to world of self aggrandizing shorthand. Keep strangers and people you hated in high school up to speed with every mundane detail of your life 24/7.

'Welcome the the delusion of having an interesting life and friends.'

Facebook declined to comment on the parody.
