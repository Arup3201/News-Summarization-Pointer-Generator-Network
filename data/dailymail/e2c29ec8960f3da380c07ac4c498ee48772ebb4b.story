Independent: Beyoncé sang to empower women at the Chime For Change

One of the organisers of yesterday’s 
star-studded Chime For Change concert has criticised the BBC for 
refusing to broadcast the event live — saying it is obsessed with 
sending staff on a ‘jolly’ to Glastonbury.

Harvey Goldsmith, the promoter who helped assemble yesterday’s stellar line-up, said he was disappointed that the Corporation declined his request that the gig, for the empowerment of women in the developing world, should go out live.

Instead British viewers made do with an hour of highlights aired on BBC1 at 10.50pm, 20 minutes after the event, which featured performances by Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Rita Ora and Florence + The Machine, had finished.

Mr Goldsmith, who co-organised the 1985 Live Aid Concert,  said: ‘The idea behind the concert is to launch a charity which will help millions of women and young girls around the world. In a lot of countries it went out live. In fact in most of them.

‘I am disappointed that the BBC did not broadcast the event live. I think all the BBC is interested is in Glastonbury.

‘They have got about five million people working on it. It’s their jolly and everything else gets short shrift.’

A global audience of more than one billion in more than 150 countries was expected to tune into yesterday’s show from Twickenham Stadium.

The event was the brainchild of Beyoncé, actress Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini, the creative director for Gucci. Each of the women, who are friends, has responsibility for a particular area of social policy within the charity and together they chose the acts for last night’s show.

The event featured promotional films about the charity’s causes  and A-list presenters including Madonna; Hollywood actors James Franco, Jessica Chastain and Jada Pinkett-Smith; Archbishop Desmond Tutu; feminist activist Gloria Steinem; and Hayek.

Asked why the BBC hadn’t broadcast the event live, Mr Goldsmith replied: ‘Don’t ask me. The BBC gets stranger and stranger as the years go on.’

A spokesman for BBC1 said it had taken the decision to broadcast only highlights from the concert because the show had commercial sponsors.

But Mr Goldsmith’s comments have put the spotlight on the BBC’s preparations for this years’ Glastonbury Festival, which begins on June 26 and will be headlined by The Rolling Stones.

The Corporation is sending 296 staff to cover the festival – up on the 263 it sent in 2011 – and will even feature the event on Songs Of Praise and The One Show.

But despite the hype, the BBC faces the prospect of being humiliated by The Rolling Stones, who are adamant they agreed to play Glastonbury for the fans – not the BBC.

A BBC spokesman said that discussions with the Stones were ‘constructive and are ongoing’.
