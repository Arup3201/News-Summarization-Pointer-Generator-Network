Hundreds of ultra-wealthy Britons are being investigated for tax evasion following the exposure of their secret offshore accounts.

International spy agencies are thought to have helped obtain a 'goldmine' of data that names high-profile multi-millionaires and their financial advisers.

The files show how the rich have hidden billions in Singapore, the British Virgin Islands and the Caymans.

More than 100 individuals have been identified so far – and have already been sent warning letters by HM Revenue & Customs.

'You're talking about super-rich people,' said one source, who added that many of the names on the list were well known.

Offenders face paying the tax they have dodged along with massive fines.

Officials are unsure what sums are at stake but pointed out that a crackdown on millionaires who hid money in Liechtenstein is expected to raise £3billion.

Last night George Osborne said: 'The message is simple: if you evade tax we're coming after you. This data is another weapon in HMRC's arsenal.'

The Chancellor has previously expressed shock at the extent to which the wealthy were exploiting tax loopholes.

It emerged last year that one scheme, 
used by comedian Jimmy Carr and more than a thousand others, enabled 
them to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax.

The scheme was said to shelter 
£168million a year from the taxman in Jersey. Carr said he had made a 
terrible error of judgement and was no longer involved.

HMRC and the Treasury refused to comment on the source of the secret files which arrived at tax authorities in the UK, US and Australia in two chunks.

But Whitehall sources suggested intelligence agencies, including the CIA, may have been involved in the operation to obtain the information.

It is understood the files were handed to tax authorities three years ago but were kept a closely guarded secret until the unstructured data was put in usable form.

Phil Berwick, a partner at international law firm Pinsent Masons, said those with doubts about the legitimacy of their overseas tax arrangements would be 'spooked' by news of the secret files.

'This is a clear warning shot against accountants and other advisers that HMRC is going to come after them if they are involved in establishing offshore structures,' he added.

'HMRC is keen to clamp down on accountants and other advisers who they feel have overstepped the mark.'

The Government's tax crackdown has seen several British territories sign bank account disclosure agreements. It is also behind a globally coordinated drive against tax evasion.
