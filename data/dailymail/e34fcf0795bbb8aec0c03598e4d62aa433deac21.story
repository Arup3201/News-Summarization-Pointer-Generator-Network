An Oregon couple were lucky to escape injury after their dog triggered a trip wire that was attached to a homemade gun in the woods last week.

Mike and Jennifer Colbach. of Portland, were hiking in Forest Park last Thursday when they noticed two men who 'were acting really hinky'.

The pair appeared out of nowhere and Mike said they looked like 'the back end of a robbery', according to The Oregonian. 

While walking into the main trail, Mike and Jennifer noticed a parachute cord on the ground, which they avoided, but their dog Rhoda stepped on.

Investigating: Mike Colbach (right) and his dog Rhoda returned to a trail near their home outside Forest Park   in Portland, Oregon to show police a trip wire attached to an improvised gun on the trail last week

Lucky escape: Fortunately no one was injured when the dog tripped the wire

The couple realized that something was moving in the trees and, somewhat alarmed, quickly left.

However Mike Colbach was troubled about what happened on their regular walking route and went back to investigate a few days later.

He discovered the cord was rigged up through the trees to a makeshift gun.

The weapon was made from a pipe, that was opened one end and closed the other.

At the closed end was a firing pin, and inside the pipe was a shotgun shell.

Tripping the parachute cord was meant to trigger a beer bottle that would swing down and hit the firing pin, causing the bullet to fire.

However it must have malfunctioned with the Colbach's dog stepped on in it.

'Members of the bomb squad told me, ''Dude, you had a shotgun shell pointed right at your head - twice'','Mr Colbach told The Oregonian after reporting the matter to police.

Mike Colbach said the parachute cord was rigged to a three-quarter-inch-diameter pipe - open at one end, closed at the other - attached to a tree

Scene: The incident occurred in Forest Park, a popular hiking and walking spot in Portland, Oregon

Police have taken the weapon as evidence.

Authorities said it was rare to see such a device in a public park, as they tend to be more common in rural areas where people are trying to protect something.

No other such booby traps have been found in the park.

Mr Colbach believes it was the work of the two men they saw.
