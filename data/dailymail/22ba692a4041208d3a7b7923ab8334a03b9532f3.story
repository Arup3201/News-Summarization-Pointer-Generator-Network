An arms collector examining a 'decommissioned' grenade at a military show had her finger blown off when it exploded in her hand.

Sarah Bluck, 48, was inspecting four grenade casings and was unaware one of them was still loaded with munitions.

The blast tore off the end of her left middle finger and also caused burns to her stomach, legs and arms.

After the explosion Ms Bluck threw the grenade into a nearby tent where it went off a second time.

She was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to save three quarters of the digit.

Police were called to the scene and isolated the area with a safety cordon before calling the bomb squad.

Ms Bluck, of Sheerness, Kent, had stayed the night at the War and Peace Revival show, at Folkestone racecourse, in Kent, when she was injured on Saturday.

She said: 'I tried to wrap my hand up with my sleeping bag, but all I could do was call for help.

'I've been around explosives long enough to deal with pyrotechnics and thunder flashes and smoke grenades in the past. This was just totally unexpected.'

Emergency surgery: Ms Bluck was taken to hospital but lost the end of her left middle finger. The incident is being investigated by the Health and Safety Executive and Trading Standards

The owner of the trade stand which was displaying the grenades said it would be inappropriate to comment while investigations were under way.

Event organiser Rex Cadman said the device which exploded was 'definitely not' part of any of the show's displays or events.

The five-day show is billed as the biggest military vehicle and living history event of its kind in the world.

A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'Kent Police was called at 6.47am on 20 July to a report that a woman had been injured at the War and Peace Revival Show at Folkestone Racecourse.

'She was taken to the William Harvey Hospital for treatment.'

The incident is being investigated by the Health and Safety Executive and Trading standards.
