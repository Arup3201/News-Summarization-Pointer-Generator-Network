Christopher Cruz is accused of causing a crash and sparking a confrontation that left a fellow member of his biker club paralyzed and led to a tech executive being brutally beaten in front of his wife and young child.

But Cruz says it's his life that's ruined. 

The 28-year-old father of two claims he never intended to box in Alexian Lien's Range Rover SUV on New York City's West Side Highway last Sunday - he was only changing lanes and looked back to see where his friends are.

No guilt: Christopher Cruz, 28, says he is not responsible for the injury of a fellow biker or the beating of Alexian Lien - even though he is accused of starting the crash that kicked off the violence

Cruz isn't charged with participating in the horrific six-on-one beating that left Mr Lien hospitalized, but police believe that he was trying to force him to slow down or stop. He is charged with reckless driving and false imprisonment.

He says the charges and the publicity from the case have ruined him.

'It's turned my life upside down right now,' he told ABC's 'Good Morning America' Monday.

He also denied that he was driving recklessly.

'I had no intentions to slow him down or to cause any type of problem,' Cruz

'I didn't think I was doing anything wrong by just cutting into another lane.'

Video from a fellow rider's helmet cam shows Cruz looking back as he changes lanes inches in front of the SUV.

Mr Lien then struck Cruz's motorcycle.

After the collision, Mr Lien then panicked and plowed through the crowd of bikers that stopped around him. Mr Lien struck Edwin Mieses Jr., 26, and ran him over run over, leaving him with broken bones and spine injury that paralyzed him.

Mr Lien called 911 and attempted to flee the bikers, but they chased after him.

When he exited the highway and had to stop for traffic, several furious bikers attacked the SUV, pulled Mr Lien and brutally pummeled him - including stomping on his head. 

But Cruz says he has no guilt about the incident, which all started with the crash he is accused of causing.

'I don't feel responsible,' he said.

'But I do feel bad for the family that go hurt.'

Busted: Reginald Chance is accused of shaming Mr Lien's window with his helmet before beating him

Chance turned himself into police and was arraigned in Manhattan

Police have arrested two other men in connection with the attack. Reginald Chance, 38, is accused of smashing Mr Lien's window out with his helmet.

Robert Sims, 35, is accused of stomping on Mr Lien's head as he tried to crawl away from his attackers.

The NYPD has released a picture of a third suspected attacker.

However, the New York Post reported this weekend that detectives believe up to six bikers participated in the savage beatdown of Mr Lien.

Kevin Bresloff, the biker who filmed much of the encounter, says he has received death threats from other members of the biker club because he is cooperating with police detectives investigating the incident.
