The businessman tangled up in the sensational investigation of his wife’s murder has now been arrested for allegedly trying to hire someone to kill a witness in the trial.

Bob Bashara of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, who is a person of interest in his late wife Jane Bashara’s murder, was allegedly caught on tape trying to hire a hit man to take out handyman Joe Gentz.

Gentz, who confessed to strangling Mrs Bashara, has been in jail since March. Bashara was allegedly plotting to have him killed while behind bars.

The Detroit Free Press first reported the latest bizarre development in a murder case marked with bizarre twists at every turn.

Bashara was arrested yesterday around 6pm outside his commercial rental property – the same place, the Free Press notes, where he was said to have a sex dungeon.

He could be arraigned as soon as Wednesday. An exclusive video from Click Detroit shows Bashara in a jail cell, breathing onto the glass, and wiping away precipitation with his finger.

His lawyer, David Griem, told reporters that he was arrested on a charge of solicitation to murder a witness, and added that he is speechless at the arrest.

‘Who in their right mind would arrange a hit inside a prison?’ he asked outside of the building. ‘I think he believes this was all part of a set-up,’ he told the Free Press. 

Gentz is undergoing a competency evaluation to determine whether he is fit to stand trial. 

Jane Bashara, was reported missing by her husband on January 23. The next day, her body was found behind the wheel of her Mercedes SUV, which was parked in an alley in Detroit.

The 56-year-old had been strangled to death, and bruises on her body and broken finger nails proved she 'fought for her life', according to police.

While police have long considered Bob Bashara a person of interest in his wife’s murder, he has not been charged - but reports say that may soon change.

Gentz, a local handyman who admitted in January that he was hired to kill Mrs Bashara by her husband, was arrested in March and charged with the murder.

Gentz also faces charges of conspiracy, an indication that authorities believe more than one person was involved.

Fear: Bashara insists he has no reason to kill his wife of 26 years and is petrified of spending his life behind bars

Since his wife’s murder, Bob Bashara has vehemently denied being involved, but Gentz tells a different story, saying Mr Bashara promised him money and a used car if Gentz killed Mrs Bashara.

In an email to Ohio’s The News-Herald, Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney spokeswoman Maria Miller said: '[The case is] still under investigation’.

However, the paper reports that word from the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office indicate Bashara will be brought in either this week or next week to face charges.

In an appearance on Good Morning America in February, Bob Bashara, 54, with his daughter Jessie proclaimed his innocence in the case.In the meantime, The News-Herald reported that Bob Bashara has collected about 24 letters from character witnesses to use in court if he’s charged with the murder in an effort to secure a release from jail on bond.

He said: 'I did nothing wrong. I didn't commit murder. I didn't pay to have my wife killed. I'm going to see this through to the end. And I'm innocent.

'And all the badgering, and all the bad words, and all the negativity, I'm going to have to live through'.

Police again searched the Bashara's Grosse Pointe home in February and found blood in the garage - something they said they missed in their initial extensive search of the property and the surrounding area.

Bob Bashara said he finds it 'fishy' that it's the first time they found it despite extensively searching the home two weeks ago.

On the day of Jane's memorial service, Gentz, a man known to the family, turned himself into police and said Bashara pointed a gun to his head and made him kill his wife, something he said he was paid $2,000 for.

It also emerged that Bashara was having an affair with a woman called Rachel Gillette and was planning on buying a house with her.

But he told GMA he had 'no reason' to kill his wife of 26 years and that he loved her very much: 'We had a very good, open relationship. I'm frightened about this. To know that I could spend the rest of my life in jail for a crime I didn't commit is a very scary thing.'

The 54-year-old said he came home to find his wife missing and the lights and TV left on in their home.

Mr Bashara said he last spoke to his wife when she was driving home from work but phone records showed no such phone call took place.

The local businessman admitted he and Gentz, 48, had a dispute over a $600 bill and Mr Bashara's attorney believes Gentz may have showed up at his home and demanded money from  Jane before getting into a struggle with her.

Deceit: Though they had been married for 26 years, Mr Bashara was said to be having a relationship with a woman who he was planning on buying a house with

Her husband told police that Gentz's version of events was absurd and said he does not even own a firearm. He told GMA the allegations are a 'sick assessment' that 'shows how deranged he is'.

'I do believe he's the one that did it. He wanted more money from me. He badgered me. And yes, I do believe he's capable of it,' Mr Bashara said.

It has been reported that Gentz has the IQ of a third grader. He told police he turned himself in as he did not want to be wholly implicated in the crime but that Mr Bashara was the mastermind behind it all.

Investigators also confirmed they found an 'S&M sex dungeon' in the basement of a bar Mr Bashara owned called the Hard Luck Lounge.

A Detroit dominatrix named Lady Geanna told WXYZ-TV that Mr Bashara hosted S&M sex parties there.

She said: 'Several of my clients or slaves have called me today. Since this has come out I've had like over 20 phone calls.

'They are all people who have been to his parties and asked if I was involved with them,' she said on Friday. Some of them were worried there might have been hidden cameras, things like that'.

Sources confirmed the room was filled with whips, chains and a bed and that Mr Bashara had been drinking at the Hard Luck Lounge the night his wife was murdered.
