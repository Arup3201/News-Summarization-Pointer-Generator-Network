When Weetabix last expanded their wholegrain product they went for chocolate chips and golden syrup.

Now they are set to add green tea into the mix in a bid to appeal to the Chinese.

The iconic cereal brand is hoping to crack the overseas market by adapting the traditional cereal to the Chinese preference for savoury tastes.

Giles Turrell, chief executive of the Weetabix Food Company, said they were planning to experiment with a raft of different flavours, one of which would be the tea which originated in China.

He said: ‘We’re having a think about what we’d add to Weetabix to make it savoury.

‘In the same way as we’ve added chocolate chips or golden syrup or banana to cereals here, you could add other savoury flavours, like green tea, sesame seeds, cranberries and other fruits.’

While the plans were still in their early stages, the research department in the UK is currently working with the flavour houses in China and consumer panels to test the flavours, he said. Within two years they are expecting to have adapted the range and have it selling on the foreign markets.

Weetabix is being helped by its part-owners, the Bright Food Group, one of China’s biggest food manufacturers.

The company, which is based near Kettering in Northamptonshire, also owns Alpen, Ready Brek and Wheetos, as well as Barbaras in the US. Mr Turrell said Alpen could adapt well to Chinese tastes too ‘because it already has got oats and nuts, and multiple ingredients to which we can add savoury flavours'.

He said their research had involved joining Chinese families for breakfast in their homes to understand their morning eating habits.

He added: ‘A research company sets up a breakfast in consumer homes and we go and watch and ask questions.

‘Or we go on an accompanied shop to see what they buy and how they choose their food.’ Mr Turrell told the Daily Telegraph the results had not been that surprising. He added: ‘We have learned that they like savoury, not sweet, hot not cold, and fast because they are incredibly time-starved.

‘The analogy is that 10 years ago, coffee didn’t really exist as a habit in China – it was all tea. But now look at Starbucks or Costa and how successful they are.’

The cereal market in China is just £180 million, a mere fraction against the UK’ s £1.9 billion sales a year.

In 2010, Weetabix claimed to have created the ‘holy grail’ of childrens’ breakfast time by introducing chocolate chips to their breakfast bars.

They said Chocolate Weetabix had all the wholegrain goodness of regular Weetabix with just half the sugar of the average chocolate-flavoured breakfast cereal.

In 2012 they added golden syrup to the equation, which again had the wholegrain content of their traditional product and half the usual sugar content of a sweetened cereal.
