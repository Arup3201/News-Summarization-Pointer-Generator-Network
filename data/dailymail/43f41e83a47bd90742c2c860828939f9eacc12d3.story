When Codemasters got behind the wheel of the F1 licence two years ago, they created one of the finest racing simulations ever made in F1 2010.

Its successor, F1 2011, was also strong, although minor aesthetic updates and marginal multiplayer modifications left many fans wanting more.

Graphical showcase: The game is vibrant and looks stunning in motion

Thankfully, it’s clear F1 2012 is not just a simple update. Rather, it's a complete overhaul, with accessibility now just as important as simulation.

The engine room powering this new focus is the Young Driver Test – which you’re thrown into almost immediately, before having had a chance to admire the game’s new menu screens.

Here, you are taught how to drive a F1 car, from using KERS and DRS, to hitting the apex and accelerating away from a corner.

It’s a smart, casual introduction that bodes well for those new to the genre. However, some challenges lack that extra level of instruction, resulting in a trial-and-error feel quickly developing.

Once you feel confident enough, there are plenty of different modes on offer. In Champions Mode you go up against six F1 champions currently racing in the 2012 season in quickfire scenarios.

These range from trying to keep behind Lewis Hamilton in the rain with the wrong tyres, to reining in Sebastian Vettel at Hockenheim while trying to get the fastest lap of the race.

Race is on: Tactics are more important than ever in F1 2012

For players after arcade-style thrills, Season Challenge allows you to pick a rival and race to try and beat him.

Keep on doing so and you’ll soon win a new contract to a better team. You'll also be awarded a score at the end of the season.

It’s a welcome lightweight addition to the simulation-heavy franchise, adding a more causal element to gameplay while not intruding on the hardcore career mode.

It is here where authenticity takes precedent. Where the most minor of tweaks to tyres, brake balance and suspension prove as much a deciding factor to a race victory as the driver itself. F1 2012’s career mode is dauntingly realistic.

The improved suspension system and downforce mechanic affects the handling substantially, and the cars feel weightier than in the 2011 game.

Cars are noticeably more twitchy to handle and require much more delicate touches to meander successfully around hairpin corners.

Whereas F1 2011 encouraged the player to attack corners head-on and at speed, the razor-sharp and totally unforgiving responsiveness to even the slightest stick movement results in a much more tactical experience.

Eye of the storm: The game successfully captures the 'feel' of driving an F1 car

When you get it right, it’s incredibly rewarding – the aerodynamic grip is illustrated brilliantly, presenting the player with plenty of feedback.

This realism update also applies to the racing rules, which have all been tweaked. However, penalties for cutting corners, for example – although giving you time to position back – are extremely erratic in their implementation.

That being said, racing is brilliantly executed. There has been a move away from the rather grey palette of first two outings, with vibrant colours and stunning car models on show throughout. Lighting has been improved, too.

There’s also that fantastic sensation of speed F1 fans have come to expect from the series – perfectly capturing the drama and white-knuckle thrills of a race.

F1 2012 is a game that appeals to new fans while staying true to what hardcore gamers know and love. It’s a fantastic package that looks and feels like the real thing.
