A commuter train bound for Los Angeles derailed before dawn on Tuesday in a fiery collision with an abandoned commercial pickup after the truck's driver took a wrong turn and got stuck on the tracks.

That driver, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Arizona, was briefly hospitalized then arrested Tuesday afternoon on suspicion of felony hit-and-run,said Jason Benites, an assistant chief of the Oxnard Police Department.

There was a loud boom and the screech of brakes before three of the train's five cars toppled over, sending 30 people to hospitals. Four were in critical condition, including the engineer.

'It seemed like an eternity while we were flying around the train. Everything was flying,' said passenger Joel Bingham. 

Investigators are seen behind police tape as they walk past the mangled truck driven by Alejandro sanchez-Ramirez that was hit by a Los Angeles-bound Metrolink train in Oxnard, California on Tuesday

'A brush of death definitely came over me.'

Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash. 

They were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said. The four passenger cars remained largely intact, as did the locomotive.

Police found the disoriented driver of the demolished Ford F-450 pickup 1.6 miles from the crossing 45 minutes after the crash, said Benites.

Sanchez-Ramirez, who delivers produce, was driving a pickup with an empty bed pulling a trailer with some welding equipment in it. He told police he tried to turn right at an intersection but turned prematurely and his truck got stuck straddling the rails.

Police said they tested Sanchez-Ramirez for drugs and alcohol but they would not discuss the results.

There were no fatalities following the crash of a commuter train which was on its way to Los Angeles but 28 people were injured, four in a critical condition

The crossing where the crash happened has been the scene of many collisions over the years.

The train, the first of the morning on the Ventura route, had just left its second stop of Oxnard on its way to downtown Los Angeles, about 65 miles away, when it struck the truck around 5:45 a.m. There were 48 passengers aboard and three crew members who were all injured.

The engineer saw the abandoned vehicle and hit the brakes but there wasn't enough time to stop, Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Sergio Martinez said.

Bingham said the lights went out when the train fell over. He was banged up from head to toe but managed to find an escape for himself and others, many of whom had been asleep when the crash happened.

'I was just shaking,' he said. 

'I opened the window and told everybody, `Come to my voice.'

Firefighters set up red, yellow and green tarps to categorize people according to their injuries, taking 28 to hospitals by ambulance. Two of the 22 people treated at the scene later showed up at hospitals, but only eight people had been admitted by the end of the day.

'Patients have complained of dizziness, of headaches, of lower back pain, of pains related to being bumped, thrown, hit and so forth,' said Dr. Bryan Wong, chief medical officer at Ventura County Medical Center.

One patient described how he had been working on his laptop and a moment later there was a sudden jerking motion that happened so quickly he wasn't able to grab hold of anything, Wong said. He was violently tossed against a wall of the train.

The train typically would be accelerating out of the Oxnard station past verdant farm fields at about 55 mph, Metrolink spokesman Scott Johnson said. With braking, he estimated it would have hit the truck at between 40 mph and 55 mph.

The train was pushed by a locomotive in the rear, allowing trains to change direction after their run without having to turn around or swap engines. It's a configuration that has been criticized for putting passengers in a vulnerable position in a crash.

After such a crash killed 11 people and injured 180 others in Glendale in 2005, Metrolink invested heavily to buy passenger cars with collapsible bumpers and other features to absorb impact.

Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said the Oxnard crash showed the technology worked.

'Safe to say it would have been much worse without it,' he said.

The city of Oxnard has wanted to build a $30 million bridge over the crossing for 10 years, but is only at the environmental review stage, said Darren Kettle, executive director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission.

There have been six accidents at the crossing in the past seven years, including one in which a driver accidently turned onto the tracks in 2010 and was struck by a Metrolink train and injured, according to federal railroad accident reports. Two people were killed at the crossing last year when a car struck an Amtrak train.

Sanchez-Ramirez, the driver in Tuesday's crash, told police he turned onto the tracks before the crossing arm came down, which occurs 29 seconds before a train arrives. It wasn't clear how long his truck was stuck before the train hit it.

The accident happened on the same line as Metrolink's worst disaster when 25 people were killed September 12, 2008.

A commuter train engineer was texting and ran a red light, striking a Union Pacific freight train head-on in the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth. More than 100 people were hurt in what was one of the worst railroad accidents in U.S. history.

The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration were sending investigators to the Tuesday crash in Oxnard.

Cranes moved the trains at the end of the day, but the tracks, which are also used by Amtrak and freight trains, remained shut down.

Officials initially said that the driver had stopped his produce truck on the tracks and the accident was 'avoidable'. 

However at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Oxnard police Officer Miguel Lopez said the man may have accidentally turned on to the tracks and become stuck became he did not know the area. 

When police first responded to the scene they found the tractor-trailer 'engulfed in flames'. 

Once fire crews extinguished the blaze, police found the cabin of the truck empty. It was also not clear if the truck was carrying any produce at the time of the crash. 

A patrol cop later found a 'disorientated man' walking along the side of the road and who was confirmed to be the driver.  

Authorities described the driver as 'unsettled' but would not say if he was under the influence of alcohol or substances. It was also unclear if the driver was properly licensed.

The crash was reported at 5.44am on Tuesday, according to officials. Some 51 people were traveling on board the train to LA at the time.

According to the LA Times, three of the four train carriages had a 'crash energy management'.

Metrolink's website explains that since 2010, 117 new cars used by the rail company have had the latest safety technology which included redesigned seats, work tables and 'energy absorbing' zones at the ends of cars.  

One overturned train carriage was lying half on the tracks and half on the highway running parallel to the train line.

Some passengers were treated in triage areas set up at the scene while others were taken by ambulance to local hospitals.

Firefighters and emergency responders were seen treating numerous people at the scene, ABC7 reported.

Metrolink's website says the train was on a run from Ventura County to Los Angeles. 

Metrolink tweeted: 'VC Line 102 to Los Angeles is stopped between Oxnard & Camarillo due to striking a vehicle on the tracks.'

The company canceled trains on the line on Tuesday and encouraged commuters to seek alternative transport. 

The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a 'go-team' on Tuesday to the scene of the accident.

The scene was in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Prior to Tuesday's collision of a Metrolink train with a tractor-trailer in Ventura County, the Southern California rail company has had several major accidents. Tuesday's accident left around 30 people injured but no fatalities, according to fire chiefs. 

In 2002, two people were killed and 22 other passengers seriously injured when a BNSF freight train hit a Metrolink train in Placentia, California, head-on.

Three years later, a crash in Glendale, California (pictured right), killed 11 people and left more than 100 injured with 40 passengers left in a serious condition. 

A Metrolink passenger train hit a vehicle on the tracks, jackknifed and smashed into a freight locomotive and a Metrolink train traveling the opposite way.

The driver of the vehicle left on the tracks in 2005 was charged with 11 counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole in June 2008.

In 2008, 26 people were killed and 135 injured when a train collided with a Union Pacific freight train and toppled carriages in the Chatsworth neighborhood of LA. 

The driver of the tractor-trailer,  Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez,which was on the tracks reportedly ran off but was caught, authorities said
