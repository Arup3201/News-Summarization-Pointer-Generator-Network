Rona Fairhead was under further pressure to resign as head of the BBC Trust last night following an intervention from a predecessor.

Michael Lyons said she should consider whether the public still trusted her in light of her involvement with HSBC when the bank allegedly helped wealthy clients evade tax. 

Mrs Fairhead, who received more than £500,000 in fees and benefits from HSBC last year, has been asked to resign by MPs who accused her of either being naive or incompetent.

The 53-year-old businesswoman, who is paid £110,000 a year as BBC chairman, insists she knew nothing about any wrongdoing at HSBC.

But Sir Michael, who chaired the BBC's governing body from 2007 to 2011, said her reputation had been damaged.

'She has to ask herself whether, in the substance and process of what she has been through, it has damaged her ability to speak on behalf of the licence fee payer,' he said.

'Is Rona confident she can command public support? If she has any hesitation about that, she can't do the job.'

Some MPs took an even tougher line yesterday, lambasting Mrs Fairhead's ability to hold the BBC to account, and calling on her to step down. 

'I don't trust her to be right sort of person to do that job,' said John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley.

'She just swallows what she's told and doesn't challenge anything. She's not doing her job. She was not at all convincing.

'One of the problems with cover-ups is that senior directors don't ask questions. The BBC has its own cover-ups and [the HSBC scandal] raises questions about whether Rona is the right person to examine them.'

Labour MP Helen Goodman said Mrs Fairhead would have to take action to restore her credibility: 'She needs to give a much better explanation than she did [on Monday] to the public accounts committee and needs to show that her own financial interests will not in any way influence editorial policy.'

Mrs Goodman added: 'She should consider whether she should be a director at HSBC. She needs to choose between them. How many jobs does a woman need?'

Mrs Fairhead has been a director of HSBC since 2004 – longer than the decade recommended as a maximum tenure for good corporate governance – and remains on its board.

She was also head of its audit committee for three years, between 2007 and 2010. 

Her pay last year included a £334,000 fee as non-executive director of HSBC North America Holdings. She earns a further £130,000 as a non-executive director of PepsiCo.

She was one of a panel of HSBC bosses hauled in front of the Commons public accounts committee and who spent the session trying to blame others for the tax evasion scandal at its division in Switzerland.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, told Mrs Fairhead she was not fit for her BBC post.

A report by the National Audit Office has found the BBC had fallen behind on slashing key expenses, despite having to make cuts to its annual costs by £700million a year by 2016.
