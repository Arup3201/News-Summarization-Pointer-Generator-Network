Guilty: Nichol Marie Phelps, 30, pictured, molested the student during a dance convention in Orlando in March 2012

A female dance instructor from Cape Coral, Florida, has been convicted of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in her class.

According to authorities, Nichol Marie Phelps, 30, molested the student during a dance convention in Orlando in March 2012.

She was convicted Friday of two counts of lewd and lascivious battery and one count of attempted lewd and lascivious conduct in an Orange County court.

In the months prior to the abuse, Phelps had been cultivating an increasingly sexual relationship with the teen, including telling her she was 'hot' and discussing performing sex acts on her.

The victim told detectives she met Phelps when she started taking dance classes at the Universal Dance Academy in Port Charlotte at age 13.

She said Phelps immediately 'took a liking to her and always singled her out,' according to the Orlando Sentinel.

The even after the pupil left the academy, the contact with Phelps continued.

According to the Sentinel, police found more than 550 phone calls and text messages between the two from January to June of 2012.

The girl told investigators the married Phelps also talked about leaving her husband for her.

But the talk turned to action in March 2012 when at a dance convention in Orlando the girl tried to consol Phelps, who was crying in a bathroom.

A report obtained by the Sentinel states the instructor had become upset after arguing with a parent of another student.

The student said Phelps 'looked at her and asked why she was so hot and why did she have such strong feelings for her.'

The woman then pinned her against the wall and kissed her, she said.

The following day, when the two were loading equipment into Phelps' car inside the Hyatt garage at Orlando International Airport, the dance teacher told the teen to get into the back seat.

She then proceeded to molest her, the police report states.

Three months later, Universal Dance Academy fired Phelps after an 'emotional outburst' during a recital, the company's co-owner told police.

She was arrested in October 2012 by authorities in Orange County.
