The show will run for 265 episodes, with each one being accompanied by a short narration related to the different species, including the Nightingale

To a younger audience, the title may seem somewhat misleading.

But BBC Radio 4’s new programme, Tweet of the Day, will not have anything to do with social networking site Twitter, it will be a daily broadcast of birdsong.

Veteran wildlife expert David Attenborough is among a number of presenters who will host the series which will feature a 90-second recording of a different bird each day.

Beginning on May 6th, it will run for 265 episodes, with each one being accompanied by a short narration related to the different species, including the Cuckoo, Nightingale, Tawny Owl and Storm Petrel.

The series, which is being made by the BBC’s Natural History Unit, will be broadcast every weekday morning at 05.58am, just before the flagship current affairs show, the Today programme. One of the episodes will be repeated on Sunday mornings at 08.58am.

Attenborough will present every episode of the series in May, while other wildlife presenters including Steve Backshall, Miranda Krestovnikov and Chris Packham will then take over the role.

Scripted by BBC presenter and wildlife expert Brett Westwood, each episode will feature information about each particular bird’s behaviour and habits, as well as its literary and folklore associations.

The first episode will feature the Cuckoo, with Attenborough explaining: ‘I’m sure all of us can recognise this bird from its song. But how many of us can  say that we have actually seen the bird itself?

‘It is perhaps no surprise then that William Wordsworth wrote; “Shall I call thee bird? Or but a wandering voice?”’

Sir David Attenborough will be explaining about some species of birds as part of the soothing programme

Attenborough then goes on to explain the migrating habits of the species.

The 86-year-old said of the new programmes: ‘I’m delighted to be involved in this series. I’ve seen some of the most incredible animals on my travels around the world, but Tweet of the Day is a nice reminder of the teeming world of birds on my doorstep. As a non-ornithologist, I might even learn a little too.’

Every episode of Tweet of the Day will be available to download, while the programme’s website will include behind-the-scenes features on how the recordings were made.

The announcement comes four years after a cult radio station, which broadcast nothing but the sound of birdsong, was axed, prompting an outcry among fans.

Birdsong Radio had attracted an estimated 500,000 listeners, including the author Sir Terry Pratchett.

It played a 20 minute-long recording of birds singing in chorus, which was repeated on a continuous loop from 6am every day until midnight.

However, it was cancelled in 2009 to make way for Amazing Radio, a station which plays a mix of indie, urban, rock and jazz music by unsigned artists.

The decision caused outrage among its fans, who flooded forums and websites calling to have the programme reinstated.
