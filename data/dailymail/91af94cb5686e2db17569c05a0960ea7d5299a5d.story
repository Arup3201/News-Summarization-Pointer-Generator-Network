SAINTS TO MAKE IT SEVENTH HEAVEN 

The race for the top four has always been keenly contested, but it’s normally between the same six sides: Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal, Man United, Liverpool and Spurs. Now Southampton are forcing people to reconsider and make it seven.

That was an excellent point at Chelsea and, aside from poor marking for Diego Costa’s goal, the Saints were excellent at the back. They are so well organised, have an excellent midfield shield in Victor Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin and Fraser Forster is a top goalkeeper. He was immense against Chelsea and has been a big plus since arriving from Celtic.

The result keeps Ronald Koeman’s side in the hunt and, whatever happens, it’s been a good season for Southampton.

21 -  Southampton have conceded the fewest PL goals this season and kept the joint-most clean sheets (13). 

They have made huge strides and anyone with a talented young lad would love them to play for that club. Their transfer policy is sound and they are happy to give youth a chance thanks to their incredible academy facilities.

Some of the top clubs in Europe will be keeping tabs on Koeman because he has done a fantastic job with a side many tipped for relegation.

As for the race for the Champions League? If it keeps going as it is there are going to be some big clubs and good sides who miss out.

BOY OH BOYD! 

George Boyd typifies what has been good about Burnley this season. He works so hard for his manager and his team-mates, but he’s also got that little bit of quality to go with it.

He scored a fantastic goal against Man City — it was superb technique and such a pure strike — but I was so impressed by his work ethic. 

He covered 8.4 miles on Saturday — the fourth-highest distance in the league this season. And, incredibly, of the top 10 distances run in 2014-15, six of them belong to Boyd. That is an incredible effort and exactly what managers want.

PELLEGRINI'S CITY SLACKERS 

That was a shambolic performance from Man City. I can’t understand how a team can go from being champions to being so slack. The players almost look bored and uninterested.

It happened under Roberto Mancini and it’s happening under Manuel Pellegrini. Every time Chelsea stutter, City fail to take advantage. 

I don’t think you can pin it all on the manager, but he needs to do something and quick, because now they’re looking over their shoulder at the chasing pack.

PAIN FOR POYET 

I’ve played alongside Gus Poyet and he is one of the most passionate people in the game. That result will have hurt him.

He took full responsibility after the game but that was one of the worst performances I have seen in the Premier League. 

Sunderland were hopeless. They were sloppy with the ball and showed no real desire to get into the game. No wonder the supporters were venting their anger.

PULIS ON THE UP 

Tony Pulis has his strikers firing but, most importantly for West Brom, he has stopped them leaking goals. 

He builds teams from the back and it shows in the stats. 

At Palace last season they conceded far fewer goals after his arrival and it’s the same now at the Hawthorns. 

He’s such a specialist in the relegation scrap.

MAGIC MAROUANE STRIKES AGAIN 

I’ve never been his biggest fan, but credit where credit’s due: Marouane Fellaini was outstanding against Tottenham on Sunday.

Since he first arrived at the club he has had to fight perceptions and prove his worth. I still don’t think in the long term he is a United player — he’s certainly not someone to build a team around — but this season he has been one of their most effective players.

Louis van Gaal has made him his go-to man and it is paying off. He scored one,was involved in another and caused Spurs the most problems.

He was United’s best outfield player against Arsenal and again on Sunday, so fair play to him and Van Gaal for making it work.

N'ZOGBIA KEY TO VILLA'S REVIVAL 

I was speaking to Tim Sherwood a few weeks ago and he said the biggest problem at Aston Villa was that the players were paralysed by fear.

Tim has come in and changed all that. He has Christian Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor scoring but, more importantly, he has brought Charles N’Zogbia back in from the cold.

Paul Lambert froze him out but he is exactly the kind of creative force Villa were crying out for. He certainly doesn’t play with fear and his energy and skill tore Sunderland apart.

BLUES ARE BACK 

It's been a good week for Everton in a very tough season. The first half-hour against Dynamo Kiev was painful to watch last week — there was almost an anger around the ground at the way the team were playing. 

They had to fight so hard to get that win but you saw what it did for their confidence — they followed it with a big result against Newcastle.

I never felt they were in danger of being relegated and now they could go on a run and might even be England’s last team standing in Europe.

PALACE'S WIDE BOYS GET IT DONE 

Palace are flying under Alan Pardew and it’s the wide men who are doing the damage. Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha were excellent but it was a tough result for Chris Ramsey.

He looks like he’s playing youngsters to please the chairman but this is a time to win points, not brownie points.

JAMIE'S PREMIER LEAGUE NUMBER CRUNCHING

3 - During their demolition of QPR on Saturday, Crystal Palace scored three first-half goals for the first time in their six seasons in the Premier League. However, it was the third time this season that QPR had shipped three before the break. The fact that Matty Phillips scored from the furthest distance this PL season (40 yards) will be of little consolation for Rangers fans.

18 - Wilfried Zaha had gone 18 Premier League games without a goal or assist before Saturday, but managed both in the first half against QPR. 

21 - After failing to score in 21 games for Lille, Liverpool loanee Divock Origi grabbed a hat-trick in his side’s 3-0 win against Rennes.

2005 - Arsenal have hit some excellent form in the second half of the season. The Gunners have won eight straight home PL games for the first time ever at the Emirates and the first time overall since November 2005.

12 - Aston Villa scored as many goals in the first 18 minutes against Sunderland as they had in their previous 12 away league games (two).

1-  Southampton have not conceded more than a single goal in a Premier League away game since the opening weekend of the season, when they lost 2-1 to Liverpool at Anfield.
