Oscar Pistorius looked at porn and car websites the night before he shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, it emerged in court today.

The double-amputee athlete searched a porn website and later looked at cars including an Aston Martin Rapide R in the early evening on February 13, 2013.

His internet search history was revealed as a ballistics experts told the High Court in Pretoria how Ms Steenkamp, 29, was standing in a toilet cubicle facing the closed door when Pistorius opened fire the following night on February 14.

Captain Christiaan Mangena told 
Pretoria's High Court that Reeva Steenkamp was struck in the hip by the first bullet and then fell back on to a 
magazine holder by the toilet before she was hit by a further two 
bullets.

One bullet fired from the 9mm pistol struck her in the right arm and while another penetrated her skull as she crossed her arms over her head to protect herself, Captain Mangena said.

As Mangena threw his hands up to 
cover his head in court and replicate the 'defensive position' he said 
Steenkamp took as the last shots were fired, Pistorius put his fingers 
in his ears in an apparent attempt to block out the testimony.

June
 Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, also was in the courtroom and occasionally 
glanced at photos of the bloody scene of her daughter's shooting before 
looking away. 

Mr Mangena also testified that he believed the second bullet fired missed Ms Steenkamp 
and ricocheted off a wall inside the cubicle and broke into fragments, 
which caused bruising on her back.

Mr
 Mangena concluded, through his analysis of the shooting scene and 
wounds on Ms Steenkamp's body from post-mortem photos, that one bullet 
went through Ms Steenkamp's left hand before penetrating her skull as 
she held it over her head. 

The policeman said he could not determine the order of the last two shots.

Pistorius,
 27, is charged with premeditated murder over Ms Steenkamp's death on 
February 14 last year and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

Gunshots: While Ms Steenkamp was collapsed on the magazine rack, Pistorius fired a further three shots through the bathroom door, one of which struck her arm while the other hit her in the head

He
 says he shot Ms Steenkamp, 29, by mistake through a locked door in his 
bathroom because he thought she was a dangerous night-time intruder in 
his home.

Pistorius 
says Ms Steenkamp went to use the toilet during the night without him 
knowing, but prosecutors maintain he killed her after a loud argument 
that caused her to possibly flee and hide in the toilet area.

Mr
 Mangena said the bullet that struck Ms Steenkamp's skull broke into two
 fragments, one of which exited her head and struck the wall behind her.
 The first shot into the right hip broke Ms Steenkamp's hip bone, Mr 
Mangena said.

'I'm of the opinion that after this wound was inflicted, she dropped immediately,' Mr Mangena said.

He
 said Ms Steenkamp then slumped into a 'seated or semi-seated position' 
on top of a magazine rack near the toilet, where she was hit another two
 times.

'She ended up with her head on top of the toilet seat, and the lower part of her body on the rack', Mr Mangena said.

Pistorius
 fired from a distance of at least 60 centimetres (24in) and no further 
than a wall behind him, about three metres (10ft) away, Mr Mangena said.

He also described the impact of the type of bullets in Pistorius' gun, which were designed to cause maximum damage, he said.

'It
 hits the target, it opens up, it creates six talons, and these talons 
are sharp,' Mr Mangena said. 'It cuts through the organs of a human 
being.'

He noted the 
Black Talon brand of ammunition was often used for self-defence because 
while it caused significant damage to a human target, it was less likely
 to penetrate the first target and hit other people.

Mr
 Mangena also said he conducted shooting tests to try to pinpoint the 
location from which the bullets were fired by Pistorius in the bathroom,
 based on where the cartridge cases were found.

However,
 in his tests, he said, the cases fell at different angles. He also 
noted that the cartridge cases at the scene of Ms Steenkamp's shooting 
could have been 'moved or kicked around' during the investigation.

He
 said Pistorius was probably on his stumps when he fired, supporting the
 athlete's statement that he was not wearing his prosthetic limbs when 
he opened fire.

Mr Nel 
also asked Mr Mangena to comment on a 2012 incident in which Pistorius 
allegedly fired his gun out of the sunroof of a moving car. The athlete 
faces a firearms charge in that case, as well as two other firearms 
charges.

Mr Mangena said firing a shot in such circumstances was dangerous.

The
 bullet leaves the barrel at around 280 metres (900 feet) a second, and 
will travel upward, then stop and fall to the ground under the force of 
gravity and wind deflection, he said.

'The bullet can still kill a person,' Mr Mangena said.

Pistorius's sister was also in court today and appeared to hand Ms Steenkamp's mother June a handwritten note.

It comes after Arnold Pistorius, the uncle of the athlete, approached the 67-year-old mother in court on Tuesday.

According to the Mirror, he told her: 'I am so sorry for your loss. We as a family are just as heartroken for the life that has been lost.

'Like your family we are trying to fight for a life and also for a life that has been lost.'

In other testimony Wednesday, police Colonel Ian van der Nest testified that many of the blood spots and stains found in various parts of Pistorius' house were due to arterial bleeding, consistent with the gunshot wounds on Steenkamp's head and arm.

Some stains came from Steenkamp's blood-soaked hair as well as her short pants, which had been saturated with blood, he said.

Another witness, Col. Mike Sales, investigated the web history on two iPad tablets found in Pistorius' home. He analyzed the activity on one of the devices hours before Steenkamp was killed, he said.

Around 6.30pm South African time on February 13, 2013, a search was made on Google for a pornographic website.

Then, straight after, a page was accessed that was described with the words 'Mobile Porn, Free Mobile Porn, iPhone Porn, Phone Porn, iPad Porn'.

Other Internet searches referred to car websites and details on cars, including a Ford Ranger SUV, an Aston Martin and a British-made Morgan sports car.

Col. Sales said the searches and website history on the second iPad showed similar records to the first.

The hearing was adjourned and will resume on Monday.
