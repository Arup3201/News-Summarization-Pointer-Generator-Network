A five-year-old boy who became an internet sensation after repeatedly using the word 'apparently' during a TV interview has now scored his own commercial.

Noah Ritter, from Pottstown, Pennsylvania, who found fame following an interview with WNEP last month, is the star of an advert for Freshpet, which makes refrigerated pet food.

'Apparently this is my first ever TV commercial,' he says to the camera. 

The charming youngster plays with dogs and speaks confidently into the microphone as he extols the virtues of the pet food - with a little help from his favorite word.

Star: Five-year-old Noah Ritter, who found fame when he repeatedly used the word 'apparently' during a TV news interview last month, has now starred in a commercial for pet food, Freshpet

'Apparently Freshpet food is the best food than ordinary dog food [sic],' he says. 'He wants to eat it every night, every day. Apparently now that's good food!'

At one point in the commercial, which appears to be largely unscripted, the little boy tells viewers to call him - before giving out his telephone number. 

'Just call the Apparently Kid when you see this commercial,' he says. 'Bye and apparently!'

Noah became an internet sensation after giving a hilarious interview with  WNEP at the Wayne County Fair in August and was later invited to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.

Acting up: During the commercial, Noah pretends to be a dog - and uses his favorite word, of course

In the WNEP video, a newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the fair in Honesdale and asking him what he thought of a new ride.

'It was great and apparently I've never been on live television but apparently sometimes I don't watch the news because I'm a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the remote I have to watch the Powerball,' he said loudly into the microphone.

The news reporter pushes him further, asking him again for his view on the ride.

'Well, it was great because apparently you're spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that's all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I've never ever been on live television.'

Star-in-the-making: Noah was discovered at a fair in Pennsylvania last month when a news reporter asked him for his view on a new ride - and he used the word 'apparently' eight times in 90 seconds

Fan: He appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show last week and revealed he now prefers the word 'seriously'

Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times.

Later speaking with the Today show, he admitted he didn't even know what the word meant.

'No, I don't know how to spell "apparently",' he said. 'I don't know what it means, but I use it in, "Wow, this is apparently annoying".'

And last week, Noah appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where he looked at ease as he chatted with the bemused host - and told her that he now has a new favorite word, 'seriously'.
