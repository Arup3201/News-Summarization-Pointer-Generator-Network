A driver who abandoned his car in the woods after it broke down 40 years ago has was shocked to find it again - in the exact same spot where he left it.

Pekka Nummelin, from Mikkeli in Finland, dumped the 1967 Ford Anglia in the woods behind in his parents house in 1974.

Mr Nummelin then moved away from the area, leaving the car behind.

Pekka Nummelin finds the car he dumped in the woods in the exact same spot behind his parents old house 40 years ago 

Mr Nummelin abandoned the car after it broke down and became virtually irreparable 

But last weekend, a conversation with his son Tommi about cars led to the pair travelling back to Mr Nummelin's old house where they found the car with all its paint, lights and glass still in tact.

The car, in seafoam green, was bought by the then 20-year-old Mr Nummelin to help him get to and from his first job.

His son Tommi told the Huffington Post that the upper radiator hose became lose and he filled the compartment with water.

This in turn froze the cooling channels meaning the engine wouldn't start and Mr Nummelin had to be towed by his brother.

But Once the cold water reacted with the hot engine, it cracked the block, meaning the car was irreparable.

Mr Nummelin discovered the car with his son Tommi after they headed to the old house to see if it was still there 

The car was then dumped in the woods behind the family home and left there even when the family moved on years later.

But with the father and son beginning to wonder what might have happened to the vehicle, they drove the 20 miles from their home to the old house where they found the car in the exact same spot.

Tommi explained: After walking for some minutes through the forest that has slowly been growing for the last 40 years, we found a small mossy patch in it where he had left his car.

The pair now plan to return to the woods behind the old family home so they can gain access to the interior of the car

'The Ford was in better nick then anoyone really expected. Because of the remote location, all glasses and lights (except one that was smashed during towing) were intact.'

However, althought the car appears to be in good shape, it has has sunk around six inches into the ground.

The pair now plan to return to the woods so they can gain access to the interior of the car, but will have to take lock picking tools as Mr Nummelin no longer has the keys.
