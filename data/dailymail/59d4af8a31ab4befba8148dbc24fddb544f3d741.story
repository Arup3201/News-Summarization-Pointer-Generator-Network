Drinking a can of fizzy drink a day could increase the risk of kidney stones by almost a quarter

Drinking a can of fizzy drink a day could increase the risk of kidney stones by almost a quarter, new research shows.

The study found that drinking sugar-sweetened drinks makes the painful stones more likely to develop.

Other drinks - such as coffee, tea and orange juice - reduced the risk, the research by Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston, U.S., found.

Dr Gary Curhan said in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology: ‘Our study found that the relation between fluid intake and kidney stones may be dependent on the type of beverage consumed.

‘We found that higher consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks was associated with a higher incidence of kidney stones.’

About three in 20 British men and one in 20 women develop a kidney stone at some stage in their life, and they are often advised to drink more fluids to prevent them reforming.

But Dr Curhan said the new study shows some drinks may be more beneficial than others.

His team studied data from 194,095 patients over an eight year period.

They found that those who consumed one or more sugar-sweetened cola servings per day had a 23 per cent higher chance of developing kidney stones compared with those participants consuming less than one serving per week.

This was true for consuming sugar-sweetened non-cola drinks as well, such as punch.

They also found that some beverages, such as coffee, tea and orange juice, were associated with a lower risk of stone formation.

Co-author, Dr Pietro Manuel Ferraro, of the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, said: ‘Our prospective study confirms that some beverages are associated with a lower risk of kidney stone formation, whereas others are associated with a higher risk.

‘Although higher total fluid intake reduces the risk of stone formation, this information about individual beverages may be useful for general practitioners seeking to implement strategies to reduce stone formation in their patients.’
