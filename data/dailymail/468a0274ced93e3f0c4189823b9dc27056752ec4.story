Bob 
Bergdahl's beard became the most controversial facial hair in all of 
America, but now critics who accused him of looking like a member of the
 Taliban can rest easy - he has shaved.

Grown
 in order to mark the time his son was in captivity as a POW in 
Afghanistan, neighbors of Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho, have said that the 
former UPS truck driver is now clean shaven.

This
 comes as it was reported that Bowe Bergdahl is still refusing to speak 
to his family, despite being sent a letter from his sister, as he 
recovers in an Army hospital in Germany.

Shaved: Bob Bergdahl (pictured with his wife Jani in May at the White House Rose Garden) has shaved his beard off to mark the release of his son Bowe Bergdahl

The
 FBI is also investigating death threats that Bob Bergdahl and his wife 
Jani have received from people furious about the deal that saw their son
 released from Afghanistan in a prisoner exchange for five Guantanamo 
detainees.

Indeed,
 despite sharpening up his look, from the moment the father of Bowe 
Bergdahl took the stage with President Obama in the Rose Garden last 
month it was clear the Bergdahl's were no average US military family.

With
 his long unkempt beard, seemingly anti-Government sentiment and an 
apparent obsession with Afghan culture and language, Bergdahl infuriated
 many with his use of both Pashto and Arabic language to thank Allah in 
front of the President at the White House.

Even
 though Bergdahl says he changed his appearance to better understand the
 Taliban who had captured his son, his appropriation of their culture 
has struck some critics as too close for comfort.

Bearded still: Jani and Bob Bergdahl, the parents of US Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, speak during a press conference at Gowen Field on Sunday, June 1, 2014, in Boise, Idaho on their return to their home state

Marking time with his beard: Bob Bergdahl, the father of an American soldier said he was proud of how far his son, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, was willing to go to help the Afghan people at a press conference in Idaho earlier this month

The hosts of Fox and Friends and Bill O'Reilly in particular were infuriated at Bob Bergdahal and his actions.

Co-host
 Brian Kilmeade criticized Bowe Bergdahl's father for a controversial 
tweet he sent and later deleted to a Taliban spokesperson, 'I am still 
working to free all Guantanamo prisoners. God will repay for the death 
of every Afghan child, ameen.'

This
 made Kilmeade furious, 'I mean, he says he was growing his beard 
because his son was in captivity. Well, your son's out now. So if you 
really don't - no longer look like a member of the Taliban, you don't 
have to look like a member of the Taliban. Are you out of razors?'

The
 sight of Bob Bergdahl standing with the President did shock many 
Americans unused to his facial hair, which bore some similarities to 
that grown by devotees of Islam.

However, what shocked them more was his use of Pashto and Arabic.

Introduced by the president, Bob Bergdahl spoke mostly English, but his rudimentary knowledge of South Asian languages shocked.

'I'd like to say to Bowe right now, who's having trouble speaking English, bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim,' he said.

'I'm your father Bowe. The people of Afghanistan, the same.

'To
 everyone who effected this... throughout the whole of American 
government and international governments around the world, thank you so 
much.'

Ready to go home: Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, sits in a vehicle guarded by the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan when he was freed by the Taliban on May 31, 2014, in exchange for five Afghan detainees held in the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba

Facial hair: Bob Bergdahl and Jani Bergdahl, the parents of captive U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, hold hands as they pray at the Bring Bowe Back celebration held to honor Sgt. Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho last year

The
 Arabic phrase bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim appears prominently in the 
Koran and means 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most 
Merciful'.

According
 to Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for conservative news 
network TheBlaze, the Taliban was thrilled to hear and see the press 
conference.

Others, however, said there was nothing so sinister in the former UPS delivery man's speech.

After
 his son was captured by the Taliban in June 2009, Mr Bergdahl said he 
immersed himself in the language and culture of Afghanistan chiefly so 
he could understand the captors, and speak to them from afar.

He
 said in a previous interview: 'I'm trying to learn a little Pashto so 
that I can speak to people... I'm trying to write or read the language.

'I probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history.'

Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, added to CNN: 'Wouldn't you try and connect with the people that had your child?

'Bob
 and Jani did everything possible they could to ensure Bowe's safety. 
And if Bob was trying to connect with them, it was to keep his son safe,
 I'm sure.'

Accompanied by President Barack Obama, Jani Bergdahl and Bob Bergdahl speak during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on Saturday, May 31, 2014 about the release of their son, U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl

As
 their son recovers, Mr and Mrs Bergdahl have kept out of the public eye
 after getting several death threats. Officials won't describe the 
nature of the threats, but acknowledge that threats have been made.

The Bergdahl have not been seen publicly since announcing with President Barack Obama that their son had been freed.

'We
 are working jointly with our state and local partners and taking each 
threat seriously,' FBI Special Agent William Facer told CNN in an e-mail
 on Saturday.

The
 threats come in the wake of controversy coming from the families of 
soldiers who were killed while supposedly looking for Bergdahl, who is 
said to have deserted his post, which is what led to his capture by 
Taliban forces in 2009.

In
 the past, Bob described a prisoner swap as a ‘win-win’ situation as he 
would get his son back and the US would improve relations with the 
Afghans.

He has become an active anti-war campaigner and spoken out against drone strikes and Guantanamo.

In
 a video posted by the Guardian newspaper, Bob told photographer Sean 
Smith: 'I don't work for the military. I don't work for the government. I
 don't represent the American people. I'm a father who wants his son 
back.'

Some activists have picked up on other tweets from Bob, as well.

In March, he wrote, '‘Democracy’ is a cult in the West' in response to a comment about the Afghan elections.

He
 also raised eyebrows when, in a press conference, he said the family's 
hometown of Hailey, Idaho, 'We're so much like Afghanistan.'

Robert Bergdahl also got criticism for this tweet, in which he called democracy a 'cult'

Idyllic? This is the beautiful homestead of Bob and Jani Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho. The Bergdahls hope Bowe will return here to a hero's welcome. But what were the circumstances of his release?

In a
 2011 video message to Bowe's captors, Bob said: 'Strangely to some we 
must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years.

'We know our son is a prisoner and at the same time a guest in your home.'

Bowe’s brother-in-law spoke to MailOnline and what he said chimed with Chip’s comments.

He denied that the Bergdahl family had sympathies with the Taliban and said that there was a ‘deeper story’ to emerge.

Michael
 Albrecht, a US navy pilot married to Bowe’s sister Sky said it was 
‘rubbish’ that Bob had any loyalties to the Taliban or Islam.

‘It
 makes no logical sense,’ said Albrecht, 38, wearing his US Navy uniform
 complete with a badge of the Black Knights, the elite fighter squadron.

‘He has no sympathies with the Taliban. Just because he speaks a few words of Pashto.

‘There are guys on my base that do that. You wouldn’t accuse them of having sympathies.’

Initial
 euphoria over the release of Sgt Bergdahl, 28, America’s only prisoner 
of war in Afghanistan, after five years has led to a growing backlash.
