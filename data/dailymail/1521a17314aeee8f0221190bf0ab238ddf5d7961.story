A 15-year-old student has died just days after he collapsed while playing a game of basketball in the high school gym.

Edly Pierre-Louis was taken to hospital after collapsing last Wednesday following six laps of the gym at Dr Michael M. Krop Senior High School in Northeast Miami-Dade, Florida.

A teacher performed CPR and the boy then spent four days at Joe DiMaggio's Children Hospital in Hollywood surrounded by his family but passed away on Sunday.

Edly Pierre-Louis, 15, was playing basketball in the gym of his Florida school last week when he collapsed and was rushed to hospital. He died four days later 

A family friend, Gerald Laguerre, told WSVN that they are unclear on Edly's cause of death because he had no underlying health problems. They have asked to see surveillance footage from the school. 

Mr Laguerre said that the teenager wrote on a website he had made that he dreamed of becoming a doctor. 

Doctors told NBC that Edly died due to an undetected congenital heart disorder.

MailOnline was awaiting on a statement from Miami-Dade County Public Schools. 

In a statement to WSVN, spokesman John Schuster said: 'Students and staff at Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School were dealing with the loss of a fellow student today, and the District's crisis counseling team was dispatched to the school to assist as needed.

'Our hearts and minds are with the family of the student during this difficult time.'
