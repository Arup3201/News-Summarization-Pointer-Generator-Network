With the imminent release of Painkiller Hell & Damnation on consoles and the exciting Deadfall Adventures announced, MailOnline talked to Wojciech Pazdur from The Farm51 and Reinhard Pollice from Nordic Games to find out what we can expect.

1.    How does this version of Painkiller differ from the PC?WP: I think additional months of expanding and polishing are noticeable. There's more content, including exclusive console maps.

Plenty of bugs have been removed and adjustments made for PC after the game’s initial release, these changes are already implemented in the console version. We put in additional effort toward code optimization and balancing gameplay and controls for using a pad. Basically it's still good old demon-slaying mayhem.

Hellishly good: Painkiller Hell and Damnation features some of the largest bosses in games of the same genre

2.    What about the graphics? What can console owners expect?WP: Besides the optimization required by the console engine itself and the screen resolution adjusted for TVs, there's not a real reduction in visual quality. Some of the textures had to be more limited with density; however during work on the console builds we've also improved the look of certain special effects.

Therefore sitting in front of the TV with a console pad, I'm actually enjoying the game more than on a PC (but my hard work at the office on this game for the last year also has something to do with that, I must admit).3.    Why did you decide to make the game on current gen with next gen around the corner?WP: Without being ready to use the game engines and not having a really clear vision of player’s expectations, the next gen consoles weren’t the best target for us. We may aim towards next gen with some of our next projects, but Painkiller Hell & Damnation was planned long ago and we were already in the advanced stages more than a year ago so we didn't want to wait. RP: The next gen release is probably not too far away but this doesn’t mean that the mass market will adapt to that with the same pace.

With the current generation we can basically make all we want. Of course there are limitations here and there but with the great technology and optimizations that we have, we can make fantastic looking games. From a business perspective it’s just very attractive to publish games for devices that have an install base of 70 Million or even more.4.    To those who are new to Painkiller, what is the story?WP: Daniel Garner, the main hero, is dead. He is trapped between Hell and Purgatory because his sins are hard to be forgiven even by Underworld's rulers.

Also with Daniel being an ultimate bada**, he's pushed to fight against demons and collect their souls for the Grim Reaper to set his own soul free and join his wife in Heaven.

Sounds fanciful? Great, that's only the beginning – the story is both a continuation and re-imagination of the events from the original Painkiller game released in 2004 and you can expect a lot of dark themes there.

All killer: Painkiller is one of the fastest FPS games around which, until now, may have best suited PC gamers

5.    You have Deadfall Adventures on the horizon. How has working on Painkiller influenced this game?WP: Besides technology, not too much. There is a different design and art team, different gameplay rules and controls, completely new ways of building the player's immersion. Deadfall Adventures is like a classic summer adventure movie, not dark and gothic fantasy horror that we can compare Painkiller with.

Of course, because of the 10 years spent on Painkiller-like titles, some of the design decisions have come surprisingly easy (like why not to add some demonic mummies). The key fun factor of Deadfall Adventures is related to exploration combined with combat, treasure hunting and puzzle solving, not to look for the fastest way to dismember as many undeads as you can.RP: Deadfall Adventures has very different demands. While Painkiller is mainly a shooting experience, for Deadfall Adventures it is necessary to make the bridge between a shooter and an adventure game where it’s all about exploration and telling an interesting story. A lot of work goes into making that right and telling a great story.

6.    What can we expect in Deadfall? What graphics engine does it use?WP: We’ve used Unreal Technology, so you may expect all the bells and whistles provided by one of the best rendering engines in the world.

The game has very specific player mechanics – you'll use not only weapons, but also adventurer's equipment like a compass, flashlight, notebook and maps.

On top of that you need to prepare for an extensive use of the most important item: your brain. Deadfall balances between action and adventure gameplay and there are separate difficulty modes for puzzles and for combat, so depending on your preferences you may customize the experience more towards your style of play.7.    What can we expect plot wise?WP: It's hard to describe it without giving away the game’s secrets. However the plot starts in the late 1930s, when the main hero named James Lee Quatermain joins an international chase for a mysterious artifact that can give people immortality. Fighting against Nazis, thugs, Russian spies and travelling across several continents, he avoids deadly traps and solves countless riddles leading to the greatest treasure of all time. 

New adventure: Deadfall Adventures is nothing like Painkiller - focusing on exploration and combat rather than trying to dismember as many of the undead as possible

8.    Will there be multiplayer and are there any unique modes given the subject matter?WP: We have multiplayer modes and also unique modes. I don’t want to reveal any more at this time.9.    What will the difference be between the PC and console versions of Deadfall?WP: We're making both versions consistent at all levels, but we plan to make some exclusive content for each platform, for now let’s just keep it as a hidden treasure to be discovered…RP: Yes and of course we do platform specific optimization and polishing to bring a great game to fans of both console and PC gaming.

Painkiller Hell & Damnation is out on May 31 for Xbox 360 andPS3. While Deadfall Adventures is released on July 30 on Xbox 360 and PC.
