Sex education lessons should include lessons in the ‘menacing’ impact on young girls, Nick Clegg warned today.

But the Deputy Prime Minister revealed his call for guidance given to teachers to be updated for the digital age is being block by Education Secretary Michael Gove.

The Cabinet split emerged as Mr Clegg said more needed to be done to teach children about relationships, amid warnings young girls feel under pressure to behave like porn stars.

Cabinet split: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he had failed to persuade the Tories to update sex education lessons to cover the dangers of the internet

Officials teaching literature for sex education lessons were last updated in 2000, and contain no mention of the internet.

Since then there has been an explosion in the number of children accessing hardcore images online, and the emergence of cyberbullying as a major threat faced by youngsters.

But Mr Clegg blamed the Conservatives for refusing to change the guidance to reflect the impact of pornography on young people.

‘I just happen to think in this instance, given how menacing this is particularly for young girls, my own view is this is an area where we need to both update the guidance… and really raise the expectation that all schools do this properly in the classroom.’

Speaking on his radio phone-in the Deputy PM admitted this view was ‘not shared across government’.

He told LBC 97.3: ‘I haven’t been able to persuade Michael Gove and the Conservatives to move all the way on this.

‘They’ve moved some of the way, so 
that for instance there is going to be guidance in the national 
curriculum on IT classes which has some bearing on this.

Reforms: Education Secretary Michael Gove has warned against over-burdening teachers with directives from Whitehall

‘The national curriculum - even though that doesn’t need to be taught by all schools - does at least raise the expectation that schools should teach this.

‘It’s one of the things that in government you debate and what I find, every day of my working life that there are some arguments where you dig your heels in and you absolutely persist until you win and there are others where you basically compromise and we compromised on this.’

He said Mr Gove is a ‘perfectly intelligent bloke’ who has a ‘very well-expressed and articulate view that schools shouldn’t be burdened with too many directives from central government’.

The Office of the Children’s Commissioner has warned that easy access to online pornography encourages teenage boys to see girls as sex objects and to engage in risky sexual behaviour.

In a major report it lifted the lid on the corrosive effect of hardcore porn on children, concluding that those who access adult images and videos are more likely to lose their virginity at a younger age.

There are even indications that boys who look at violent porn are more likely to become sexually aggressive.

The study called for urgent action by ministers, schools and parents to ‘develop children’s resilience to pornography’ after finding that a significant number have access to sexually explicit images.

Secondary schools were criticised for concentrating on the mechanics of sex during sex education classes rather than the importance of loving relationships and the report called for primary school pupils to be taught about the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ touching. 

In response, Mr Gove insisted he takes 'whole question of sex education very seriously'.

Speaking at a Policy Exchange event, he added: 'We conducted a review recently of personal, social, health and economic education and one of the conclusions we drew from that is that the right thing to do it to trust teachers.

'As soon as you create a new set of guidance to respond to what are new and challenging circumstances there is a risk that a new technology or a changing social more will render it time bound.

'So I think the most important thing to do, as schools are, that they are in touch with organisations who can help provide all the advice that students need in order to be able to grow up healthy and confident people.'

But he denied a rift with the Lib Dem leader, insisting: 'I didn’t hear Nick on the radio. I love Nick Clegg.'

The Department for Education insists that teachers should turn to expert advice on sex and relationship education, warning official guidance laid down by Whitehall could soon be rendered out of date by developments in technology.

A recent review of personal, social, health and economic education lessons found that the existing guidance ‘offers a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school’, a spokesman said.

‘The best people to help schools deal with changing technology are the experts.

'Our SRE guidance directs schools to draw on the up-to-date advice produced by experts to use in sex and relationship education. Bodies including the PSHE Association, the Sex Education Forum and government agency CEOP all produce material and advice for teachers to use.

‘We have also given almost £3million to Beatbullying, the Diana Award, Kidscape and the National Children’s Bureau to provide state-of-the-art materials on cyberbullying. We have told schools to access these to develop their own policies.’
