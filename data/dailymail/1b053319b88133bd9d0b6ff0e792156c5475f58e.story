Mario Balotelli isn't missed by AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi.

The controversial striker departed the San Siro for Liverpool this summer in a £16million deal and has so far failed to find his shooting boots at Anfield.

And Rossoneri head honcho Berlusconi believes his side are better off without the new Kop star - whom he brands a 'rotten apple'.

Matches: 51

Goals: 29

Yellow cards: 20. Red cards: 1 

'I remember [Balotelli] was bought against my advice,' Berlusconi told La Gazzetta dello Sport.

'We have many champions: (Jeremy) Menez, (Keisuke) Honda, (Stephane) El Shaarawy, (Fernando) Torres, (Nigel) De Jong.

'The base is there. And we no longer have a rotten apple in the dressing room.'

Milan are sitting in fifth place in Serie A after a dreadful campaign last season which saw the former giants languishing in eighth. 

However, Berlusconi believes his side can get back to the winning ways that saw them as one of the continent's premier clubs - targeting a home Champions League final in 2016. 

Fernando Torres is one of many champions among the base of the AC Milan squad, says Berlusconi

'Our goal is to return to Europe. We want to build a winning side,' said Berlusconi.

'I think there are cycles in football, with years of success, then breaks, then back to winning. But the fans should rest assured - the team is already competitive and we'll soon be leaders in Europe again.

'The 2016 Champions League final is in Milan. Why shouldn't we dream of being there?' 

AC Milan owner Berlusconi spoke to La Gazzetta dello Sport and is hopeful the club can make the 2016 Champions League final in Rome
