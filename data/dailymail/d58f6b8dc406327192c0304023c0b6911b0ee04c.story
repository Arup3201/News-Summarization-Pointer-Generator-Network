A British photographer has given a unique glimpse into what actually makes the internet run.

British artist and designer Timo Arnall was given unprecedented access to the usually secret and highly secure data centres behind many of the world's biggest online services.

Spanish phone firm Telefónica's 65,700 square meter data center in Alcalá, Spain, one of the biggest in Europe.

Arnall said that after being led through layers of identification and security far higher than any airport, he found the inner sanctums - the server rooms. He described them as: 'deafeningly noisy rooms cocooning racks of servers and routers. In these spaces you are buffeted by hot and cold air that blusters through everything.'

Located in the town of Alcala de Henares, near Madrid, the centre includes 23 IT rooms and a built area of 65,700 square meters.

Each module of the data centre will be independent, allowing new rooms to be activated without affecting the operation of the rest.

Similarly, the 1,200 kW of IT power for each room can be multiplied up to fourfold without impacting the housed systems.

The vast building costs €300 million according to Telefónica.

The pictures were taken alongside a high definition film Timo is set to show in Barcelona on three giant screens which wrap around visitors to give them a sense of the scale of the building.

'Internet machine documents one of the largest, most secure and ‘fault-tolerant’ data-centres in the world, run by Telefonica in Alcalá, Spain,' Arnall said.

'The film explores these hidden architectures with a wide, slowly moving camera.

'The subtle changes in perspective encourage contemplative reflection on the spaces where internet data and connectivity are being managed.'

Power to keep the servers running  is supplied not only through the mains, but backed up with warm caverns of lead batteries, managed by gently buzzing cabinets of relays and switches, said Arnall.

Server rooms are kept cool through corridors that divide the huge space. There are fibre optic connections routed through multiple, redundant, paths across the building. In the basement, these cables connect to the wider internet through holes in rough concrete walls.

Arnall said he hoped the film would allow people to see 'the loud' as a more physical object.

'In this film I wanted to look beyond the childish myth of ‘the cloud’, to investigate what the infrastructures of the internet actually look like.

'It felt important to be able to see and hear the energy that goes into powering these machines, and the associated systems for securing, cooling and maintaining them.'

'What we find, after being led through layers of identification and security far higher than any airport, are deafeningly noisy rooms cocooning racks of servers and routers,' said Arnall.

Power is supplied not only through the mains, but backed up with lead batteries.

In turn these are backed up in turn by rows of yellow generators so that the data centre can run indefinitely until power returns.

Giant stainless steel water tanks, containing tens of thousands of litres of cool water, are positioned outside in case of fire, while the roof has a football-pitch sized array of ‘chillers’ that filter and cool the air going into the building.

Rows of yellow generators with diesel storage tanks. The centre has contracts with fuel supply companies so it can run indefinitely in the even of a power failure.

Walls are fitted with special mountings so racks or servers and the equipment needed to control and monitor them can be fitted.

A server room waiting to be filled: Arnall said he wandered the halls for miles, and said the server rooms felt like 'entering an intensive care unit at a hospital.'
