Don't forget to flush: Doogal demonstrates the LitterKwitter, which allows cats to use the toilet

Sick of clearing out your cat's litterbox? An inventor has come up with a pet accessory that can train a cat to use a toilet like a human.

Jo Lapidge came up with the novel idea after watching a comical scene in the Hollywood film Meet the Fockers, showing a cat sharing a lavatory with one of the characters.

The 48-year-old Australian made a special training device out of plant pots and toilet seats and successfully taught her own moggy, Doogal, to use the bathroom like a human.

She abolished the need for a litter tray and has since developed her makeshift prototype into a product that is now sold sold worldwide.

The LitterKwitter is a set of different sized plastic 'seats' that are used to train cats, and starts with a litter tray on the floor near the toilet.

It is then placed on top of the toilet seat and eventually swapped for different size discs with holes in the middle that fit with the rim of the lid, before being removed altogether.

The Sydney resident said: 'A few years ago I bought a little Blue Burmese kitten we named Doogal.

'Not long after Doogal's arrival I soon got sick of his smelly litter tray and his frequent, toilet-going ways. As soon as I cleaned it he would go straight in and use it again.

'A girlfriend and I went went to see Meet the Fockers which featured a cat called Mr Jinx, who shared the toilet with Ben Stiller in one funny scene.

'This was the eureka moment for me and the genesis behind the invention of LitterKwitter.

'After a few weeks Doogal was trained on the first of 15 prototypes and he became a much more civilised member of our family.

'Cats bury their waste to hide the smell, which in the wild can attract predators.

'A toilet-trained cat whose waste disappears into the water of the toilet bowl would experience the same psychological satisfaction as this.

'The LitterKwitter works best with kittens as they have fewer bad habits to unlearn, but basically any healthy cat that can use a litter tray can be trained to use the toilet.

'Once a cat is trained it can use any toilet, but will naturally favour the one it was trained on."

The LitterKwitter set costs about Â£40 and is available to buy via Jo's website www.litterkwitter.com or from pet shops across the UK.
