Persian cat: Space program official Mohammad Ebrahimi said Iran's next space capsule could carry the Persian cat, breed named after Iran's former name of Persia

As Iran steps up its space programme with plans to send a human into space by 2018, the country has been using animals as test astronauts and may now turn to the distinctive, and locally named, Persian cat.

The move comes seven months after Iran claimed it launched a monkey out of earth's atmosphere and successfully returned it home, although the claims were questioned after photos appeared to show different monkeys before the launch and after it allegedly returned.

The plan is seen by Western countries as another possible step by Iran's ambitious aerospace programme, which has also raised concerns about spillover military applications.

But a senior space program official, Mohammad Ebrahimi, tried to quash doubts over its success in sending a money into space by saying state media had mistakenly sent out a photo of an alternate monkey that was not used in the February launch.

He insisted just one monkey, Pishgam or Pioneer, was sent on the 20-minute flight to a height of 72 miles and returned safely.

In 2010, Iranian officials said it sent a mouse, a turtle and some worms on a space flight - also part of the country's goals of sending a human into space by 2018 and becoming a leading tech center for the Islamic world.

Ebrahimi said Iran's next space capsule could carry the Persian cat, a long-haired, flat-faced breed named after Iran's former name of Persia.

He said the launch will happen by the end of Iran's current year, which ends March 21. A mouse and rabbit are also under consideration.

Ebrahimi said the next launch would be with a larger, liquid-fueled rocket and and launched 72 miles up. Past launches were done with solid-fueled boosters, whose technology can be used in long-range missiles.

He did not explain the reason for the rocket change, but may be an attempt to ease international concerns at a time when Iran's new moderate-leaning president, Hasan Rouhani, is seeking to revive nuclear talks with world powers.

Iran says it wants to put its own satellites into orbit to monitor natural disasters in the earthquake-prone nation, improve telecommunications and expand military surveillance in the region.

Earlier this year, the then President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he wanted to be Iran's first astronaut.
