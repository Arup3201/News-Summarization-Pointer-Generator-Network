Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver and Blur star Alex James are facing opposition from residents in the sleepy Cotswolds village of Kingham over plans to expand their music and food festival.

The celebrity chef and Blur bassist want to keep the party going at this year's The Big Feastival for longer, with extended hours for live and recorded music and alcohol sales.

However, the plans have been met with outrage by some nearby residents, who fear the 'creeping expansion' of the festival in the otherwise quiet village.

Around 16,000 people flocked to James' farm in the Oxfordshire countryside last year and some are concerned by the threat of more noise and traffic.

Organisers of The Big Feastival, which runs from August 28 to 30, have asked West Oxfordshire District Council to let them have an extra 14 hours of live and recorded music at the event.

Among the music acts due to perform at the festival this summer are Fatboy Slim, Jamie Cullum and Laura Mvula.

One opponent to the proposals, Judy Lewis from nearby Lyneham, said the music 'penetrates our homes and causes a nuisance and disturbance' and that the extension times asked for were 'excessive'.

Dr Carole Sherwood, a consultant clinical psychologist who also lives in Lyneham, raised concerns about the impact of the festival on a neighbouring nursing home.

Dr Sherwood said she found it 'hard to believe' that residents at the Langston Kingham Nursing Home would be unaffected by the music and suggested the Care Quality Commission might also take a dim view of the situation.

'As a health professional myself I feel very uneasy about the way this festival is developing in scale, year-on-year, in terms of number attending and extension into the early hours of the morning of both live and recorded music,' said Dr Sherwood.

'In view of the very close proximity of The Langston to the festival site I would hope that the needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people is given high priority when considering whether or not to grant this variation of licence.'

Michael and Sarah English, who also live in Lyneham, said: 'We are aware that last year's festival brought considerable disturbance to some Lyneham residents and beyond.

'With this in mind, we are concerned that this latest application represents an incremental drift towards a much large music festival which may not sit easily in the locality.'

Another couple, Brian Murphy and Jean Ware-Morphy, added: 'The extensions would make the noise of the festival very intrusive into the life of our family, which includes three children under seven, and risk disorder well into the night.'

Festival organisers also want recorded music to start two hours earlier on the Friday, at 10am, and be played until 1am on Saturday instead of finishing at 11pm on Friday.

They also want it to continue until 2am on Sunday, a two-hour extension, and finish at midnight on Sunday rather than 10pm. They have also requested extended hours for the sale of alcohol.

The festival organisers said: 'We have an open dialogue with the local community to minimise the impact of the festival and are governed by, and comply with, strict licensing guidelines and work closely with the licensing authority to ensure that any disruption is kept to a minimum.

'Any activity at the event is in line with our positioning as a family festival.

'We are extremely proud of the benefits that The Big Feastival has and will continue to have on the local economy.'

The festival offers discounted tickets for residents living in the OX7 postcode.

A decision on the application is due to be made by the council's licensing panel on February 26.
