A former Twitter employee who was fired from the social media giant has filed a lawsuit against the company for age discrimination and wrongful termination.

Peter H. Taylor, 57, was in charge of managing the expansion and operation of Twitter's data centers.

However in a lawsuit filed last week in San Francisco Superior Court, he claims he was terminated from the job without notice, despite acting 'in an exemplary manner', reported SF Gate.

Taylor's supervisor had given Taylor 'at least one critical mark' about his age, according to the lawsuit.

His contract was terminated September 23, 2013.

'Defendants replaced plaintiff with several employees in their 20's and 30's,' the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit also alleges Twitter discriminated against Taylor for a disability in addition to his age.

Taylor had surgery to remove kidney stones and he believes this affected the decision to have him fired.

He is seeking unspecified damages.

A Twitter spokesman says the case is without merit.

'We will vigorously defend ourselves against it,' the spokesman said.

Ageism is not new to Silicon Valley.

In 2007, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg controversially said during a Stanford University speech: 'Young people are just smarter.'

SF Weekly reports this is not the first time a major Silicon Valley tech company has been sued for age discrimination.

In 2004, 54-year-old Brian Reid filed a suit against Facebook, claiming the company discriminates against employees over 40-years-old.
