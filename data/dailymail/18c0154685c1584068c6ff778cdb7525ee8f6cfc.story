Mexican authorities have issued an alert for local officials to be on the lookout for an amount of radioactive material stolen by a group of armed thieves on Sunday night.

The Interior Department says a pickup truck carrying the iridium was stolen and later found.

But the pen-point-sized radioactive material has not been recovered.

It is enclosed in a casing about the size of a pen, used in an industrial inspection device.

A device containing radioactive substances was stolen from a government research facility and authorities are working to track it down, Mexico's No. 2 official, Government Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong (pictured), said on Friday

'We have the report regarding the theft of this material and the alerts 
and protocol we follow in these cases have already been implemented,' 
Government Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told reporters after 
speaking at a conference of state law enforcement chiefs and attorneys 
general.

The operations chief for the National Nuclear Security Commission says the device, if opened, could cause harm.

Mardonio Jimenez said the Iridium-192 has a relatively short half-life.

It is the third theft of radioactive material in Mexico since December.

The December theft of cobalt-60 used in radiation therapy was considered more serious.

Armed robbers stole a truck transporting cobalt-60 from a hospital in the northwestern border city of Tijuana to a radioactive waste storage center.

Mexican authorities located the truck and the radioactive material days later and arrested six people in connection with the heist.

None the suspects suffered any effects of radiation exposure and officials found no trace of contamination at the site where the truck was recovered.

Nuclear expert Mark Hibbs of the Carnegie Endowment think-tank said Iridium-192, a common medical and industrial isotope with many applications, 'in theory' could be used as a radiological weapon.

But, 'the perpetrators would have to accumulate enough material to disperse it effectively which may be difficult since in many cases small amounts of Ir-192 are used in sources,' he told Reuters in an e-mail.

'Unlike cobalt-60, which remains a dangerous source of radiation for many years, Ir-192â€™s shorter half-life implies that perpetrators would have far less time to fashion it into a dispersion device,' Hibbs added.
