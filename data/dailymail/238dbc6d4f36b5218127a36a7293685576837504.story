The trend for wacky wedding shoots is spreading through China, but instead of messing up the bride's dress, newlyweds are pictured celebrating their union in the workplace.

These loved-up Chinese couples are so committed to their careers that they're having their wedding photos taken at work.

Elaborate themed wedding photos, complete
 with extravagantly decorated sets, are popular in the country. However,
 these are costly and can often involve up to three days in a studio - 
which is why some hard-working Chinese find them difficult to fit into 
their working lives.

So, some couples are eschewing romantic settings for 
their wedding snaps and instead turning up for work in their 
wedding gear and using the office as the backdrop for images to commemorate their big day.

It is especially popular with life-saving professionals who work in 
hospitals and civil defence departments, who, even when they're not working, are often on stand-by.

In a competitive market, particularly for civil service jobs, those who 
opt for workplace wedding pictures have found their bosses are hugely 
supportive of the idea.

Boss
 Lok Ch'ien, who works at a planning bureau in China's capital, Beijing,
 said: 'I think it shows dedication and pride in work, and also it's 
great for the atmosphere and for office morale by giving other staff the
 chance to share in a couple's big day.'

Weilin Hou, 29, works on the special police force in the city of Chongqing.

His
 job requires him to be on 24-hour standby most of the time - a classic candidate for a work photo shoot.

Instead of 
travelling to a romantic venue, he invited his wife to his 
workplace and they set up this photo shoot on the training grounds of the 
special police force department., report RocketNews24.

Over
 in Ningbo, Haoran Xu, a firefighter took his set of heart-warming 
photos with his lovely bride and his team. Xu met his wife, Lin Chen, 
when he was a trainee at the Kunming Command School of Public Security 
and Fire Fighting Army.

Although
 they lived far apart, they managed to keep their long-distance 
relationship alive for three years, until they eventually tied the knot.

After a rushed wedding Xu promised his wife that they would have their wedding photos taken when he 'had the time'.

But being a fireman did not give him much spare time, as he had to be on standby for any emergencies.

After
 a year, it caused a row and 
when his work colleagues heard about it, they arranged for the photo 
shoot to be done at the barracks.

Those
 who have had office photographs say that it not only saves time - meaning
 more time for work - but it also saves money.

Chen
 Tsao who had his pictures done at work said: 'I didn't have time to 
take off to travel all over the place having pictures done. But I didn't
 want to miss out on the pictures, so when I heard about people doing 
them at work I realised it was a great opportunity. I can keep my wife 
happy, and my employer.'

Weddings at work are an ever-popular concept among creative couples and employers
