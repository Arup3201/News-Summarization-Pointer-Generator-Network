Hundreds of mourners gathered today to say a final goodbye to 'twinkling star' Lexi Branson who was mauled to death by her family’s dog.

The four-year-old was killed when the family bulldog Mulan went berserk at her home in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, on November 4.

A hush fell over nearby Barrow-upon-Soar as Lexi’s coffin was carried through the village on a pink horse-drawn carriage this morning.

Around 100 family and friends - all wearing Lexi’s favourite colour pink - followed the youngster’s tiny coffin through the pretty village towards Holy Trinity Church.

Mother Jodi Hudson, 31, who bravely stabbed the deranged dog to death as it savaged Lexi, wept as she walked behind the funeral carriage, comforted by relatives.

Four pallbearers carried Lexi’s coffin into the church to the strains of ‘Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star’.

Dozens of bouncers sporting Security Industry ID armbands lined the route in honour of Lexi’s father Jamie Branson, 38, himself a doorman.

After an opening prayer, the church erupted into a moving rendition of ‘All Things Bright and Beautiful’ before tributes to Lexi were read out.

Reverend Rob Paddison described Lexi as a ‘twinkling star’ and said she would be much-missed.

He said: 'One of Lexi’s friends says that Lexi is now a twinkling star in the night sky. It is her way of understanding the death of her friend.

'But isn’t it a lovely way for her to remember Lexi? Today, we are all remembering Lexi’s short life, a girl who loved and was loved.

'Today we are placing her into God’s care, God’s love.

'The God who created an amazing night sky and now we are praying that Lexi is in his arms, a twinkling light of love beaming brightly in his presence.'

In her honour: Lexi's leaves the church after the service, which included an opening prayer and a moving rendition of 'All Things Bright and Beautiful' before tributes to Lexi were read out

Much-loved: Tributes were read out from Lexi's relatives who told of her love for dancing and picking flowers

Always in his thoughts: Paying tribute to his beloved daughter, Mr Branson told the congregation: 'I will always remember your beautiful smiling face'

Tributes were also read out from Lexi’s relatives who told of her love for dancing and picking flowers.

Grandfather Alan Tait and Grandmother Kathryn Tait said: 'Lexi would follow nana everywhere she went.

'They had their own stage and would dance and sing with moves that would put Strictly Come Dancing to shame.

'Afterwards Lexi would always say "Clap Granddad".

'When bedtime came, out of the 60 or so books in her cupboard to read [it was always] "The Lost Fairy".

'Granddad would read it not once not twice but as many times as was possible until she drifted off to sleep if in fact granddad didn’t fall asleep first.'

Tragedy: Police said Lexi was attacked by Mulan (right) without provocation in the flat she shared with mother Jodi Hudson who took a knife to the animal in a bid to save her daughter

An inquest is expected to take place next year into the death of Lexi, pictured here with another dog

The order of service for Lexi's funeral service

Paying tribute to his beloved daughter, Mr Branson told the congregation: 'I will always remember your beautiful smiling face.

'You have always been in my thoughts and in my heart Lexi and always will be.

'All my love my beautiful little girl. Daddy, xxxxx'

The congregation also heard a poem penned by Mrs Hudson.

It read: 'We little knew that morning,

'God was going to call your name,

'In life we loved you dearly,

'In death we do the same,

'It’s broken our hearts to lose you,

'You did not go alone,

'For part of us went with you.'

The end of the 45-minute service was marked when the congregation said The Lord’s Prayer together.

Lexi’s coffin was carried out of the church to the strains of Maroon 5’s ‘Moves Like Jagger’ - her favourite song.

As dozens of mourners gathered outside to watch the coffin led away, an usher placed a bright-white bouquet in the shape of a star onto the casket.

An inquest is expected to take place next year.
