Home Secretary Theresa May warned the health of democratic politics would be undermined if the BBC squeezes out local competition

The BBC is ‘destroying’ local newspapers by using its taxpayer-funded dominance to squeeze out competition, Theresa May has warned.

The Home Secretary condemned the BBC for using the licence fee to fund websites in direct competition with regional and national newspapers.

And she warned that as papers close, fewer sources of news will become ‘dangerous to the health of democratic politics’.

Mrs May is the latest senior Tory to publicly criticise the BBC, stepping up pressure on the Corporation over its management and spending.

She said local newspapers are having ‘a particularly hard time’, which is being made worse by the ‘BBC's dominant position on the internet and its ability to subsidise the provision of internet news using the licence fee’.

‘This makes it enormously difficult for local newspapers to compete. If the BBC can, as they do, provide all the locally significant news, what is left to motivate the local media to buy a paper?

‘It's destroying local newspapers and could eventually happen to national newspapers as well.’

Speaking to the Society of Editors' annual conference in London, Mrs May warned: ‘This is as dangerous for local politics as it is for local journalism.

‘Because as a local MP I value the ability to raise issues in my constituency in my local newspaper but also I value its role in disseminating information about what I and local councillors are doing in the area.’

She added: ‘This is a debate that won't go away and I believe the BBC has to think carefully about its presence locally and the impact it has on local democracy.’

Mrs May said she believed ‘a plurality of news sources is essential to our democracy’. She warned if newspapers are forced to close down, the country could be left with a single source of information.

The Home Secretary said: ‘At a national level, we have a healthy number of competing newspapers in Britain and that's something we surely don't want to lose.’

Mrs May went on: ‘A monopoly on the provision of information would be a perennial temptation to malpractice, inefficiency and corruption in exactly the same way almost every other kind of monopoly is.

‘No single source of news can possibly represent the variety of opinion that there is in this country and a monopoly news provider would be far too easily captured by special interests.

‘So competition in the provision of news is essential to democracy and diminishing competition is dangerous to the health of democratic politics.

‘That's why it's important that the internet does not have the effect of making a plurality of newspapers commercially impossible in Britain.’

Mrs May is the second senior Tory in as many weeks to draw attention to BBC's role in the political process after party chairman Grant Shapps accused the corporation of biased reporting and questioned its funding.

He warned that the television licence fee could be cut unless the BBC tackles a 'culture' of secrecy, waste and bias.

Mr Shapps said the Corporation must rebuild confidence following the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall abuse scandals, controversy over fat cat salaries and pay-offs to stars and senior executives.
