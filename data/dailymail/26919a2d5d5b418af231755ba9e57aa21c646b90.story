Occupy Oakland 
protesters claimed victory after they shut down one of the nation's 
busiest shipping ports - escalating a movement whose tactics had largely
 been limited to marches, rallies and camps.

In
 a five-hour stand-off protesters vandalised businesses and smashed bank
 windows, as they tried to shut down the city - and police appeared to 
respond using tear gas and flash bang grenades.

The
 California demonstrators blocked operations at the city's port and 
stopped traffic on Wednesday in protests against economic inequality and
 police brutality, marred by scattered vandalism.

Riots: Occupy Oakland protesters pass a burning rubbish heap during a confrontation with police

As Oakland burned up, authorities were cracking down on protester camps elsewhere in the U.S.

Officials in Maryland are trying to get rid of protesters by turning off the electricity in the area. But Occupy Baltimore protesters told CBS Baltimore that won't make them leave McKeldin Square.

Occupy Minnesota protesters have got a new set of rules from city officials, who say they are banned from sleeping 
overnight at the plaza when it is below 25F - and all 
portable toilets will be removed,

New York City Mayor Bloomberg says the time has come for 
protesters to start treating their local neighbourhood with more respect - and he will ensure they are kicked out of their camp if not.

Getting ready: Police officers in riot gear form a line at the Occupy Oakland demonstration on Wednesday

Back in Oakland - riot police arrested dozens of
 protesters who had marched through downtown to break into a vacant 
building, shattering windows, spraying graffiti and setting fires along 
the way.

Jamie
 Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, was the target of protesters’ ire at 
Occupy Seattle on Wednesday, as they marched to a posh Sheraton hotel 
where he was a speaker at a University of Washington awards ceremony.

They
 chanted ‘banks got bailed out - we got sold out’ and ‘Shame on Chase’ 
and police used pepper spray to clear an entrance so people at the hotel
 could get in and out.

‘The turnout was fantastic,’ protester Sage Wilson told the Seattle Times. ‘Seeing how many people had had enough.’

They began protesting at 6pm and finished at 9:30pm after hearing Mr Dimon had left half-an-hour earlier.

‘We go from having a peaceful movement to now just chaos,’ protester Monique Agnew, 40, said.

Two
 protesters were struck by a Mercedes-Benz car last night, suffering non
 life-threatening leg and ankle injuries. 'It was a pretty volatile 
situation,' a police spokesman told the San Francisco Chronicle.

Around 3,000 people converged on the 
Port of Oakland, the nation's fifth-busiest harbour, swarming the area 
and blocking exits and streets with illegally parked vehicles and 
chain-link fences.

Oakland 
Police Chief Howard Jordan told CBS San Francisco that the vandalism was
 caused by up to 70 anarchists 'bent on creating problems'.

Port officials said they had to cease 
maritime operations, citing concerns for workers' safety - but hope to 
resume operations on Thursday and that their workers can get to their 
jobs safely.

‘Continued missed shifts represent

 well as lost jobs and lost tax revenue for our region,’ a port 
spokesman said.

Supporters in New York; Philadelphia, Los Angeles and elsewhere staged smaller-scale
 demonstrations - each group saying its protest was a show of support for
 Oakland.

The city became a rallying point when 
Iraq War veteran Scott Olsen was seriously injured in a clash with 
police last week in an incident that caused nationwide outrage among the
 protesters.

The Occupy movement has yet to 
coalesce into an organised association and until the port shut down had 
largely been limited scattershot marches, rallies and camps since it 
began in September.

Organisers in Oakland had viewed the 
day as a significant victory. Police said about 7,000 people 
demonstrated throughout the day and were peaceful except for a few 
incidents of vandalism.

'We put together an 
ideological principle that the mainstream media wouldn't talk about two 
months ago'

Boots 
Riley, protest leader

One of the protest leaders, Boots 
Riley, touted the day as a success, saying ‘we put together an 
ideological principle that the mainstream media wouldn't talk about two 
months ago’.

His comments came before a group of 
demonstrators moved to break into the Travelers Aid building in order 
to, as some shouting protesters put it, ‘reclaim the building for the 
people’.

Mr Riley, whose anti-capitalist views 
are well-documented, considered the port shut down particularly 
significant for organisers who targeted it in an effort to stop the 
‘flow of capital.’

Violence: Occupy Oakland protesters vandalised businesses and smashed bank windows on Wednesday

The port sends goods primarily to 
Asia, including wine as well as rice, fruits and nuts, and handles 
imported electronics, apparel and manufacturing equipment, mostly from 
Asia.

'If they do that after all this... they're 
smarter than that'

Boots Riley, protest leader

It also deals with cars and parts from
 Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Hyundai. An accounting of the financial toll 
from the shutdown was not immediately available.

The potential for the chaos that 
ultimately erupted was not something Mr Riley wanted to even consider. 
‘If they do that after all this ...’ He paused, then added: ‘They're 
smarter than that.’

But the peace at day did not last at 
night. Protesters voicing anger over a budget trim that forced the 
closure of a homeless aid programme converged on the empty building where 
it had been housed.

They blocked off city streets with dumpsters and other large rubbish bins, starting bonfires that leapt 
15ft in the air. City officials released a statement describing the 
spasm of unrest.

'The protesters began hurling rocks, explosives, bottles and flaming objects at responding officers. Several private and municipal 
buildings sustained heavy vandalism'

Oakland Police spokesman

‘Oakland Police responded to a late 
night call that protesters had broken into and occupied a downtown 
building and set several simultaneous fires,’ the statement read.

‘The protesters began hurling rocks, explosives, bottles and flaming objects at responding officers.

‘Several private and municipal 
buildings sustained heavy vandalism. Dozens of protesters wielding 
shields were surrounded and arrested.

Clean-up: Occupy Wall Street protesters clean the area around their tent in Zuccotti Park in New York

’Protesters reported running from 
several rounds of tear gas and bright flashes and deafening pops that 
some thought were caused by ‘flash bang’ grenades. Firemen arrived to 
suppress the flames.

Protesters at Occupy Wall Street took to the camp with soap and water today.

Campers have been attempting to improve hygiene following criticism of unsanitary conditions at the downtown Manhattan site.

The park is normally cleaned daily but has deteriorated since demonstrators moved in.

Last
 month protesters were briefly moved off site so owners could clean the 
park but they have continued to flout the rules of the park, which 
include no tarps, tents or lying down.

Meanwhile, protesters and police faced
 off for the rest of the night in an uneasy standoff. And among the 
other protests in Oakland, parents and their children joined in with a 
‘children's brigade’.

‘There's absolutely something wrong 
with the system,’ said Jessica Medina, a single mother who attends 
school part time and works at an Oakland café. ‘We need to change that.’

In Philadelphia, protesters were arrested earlier on Wednesday as they held a sit-in at the headquarters of cable giant Comcast.

In New York, 100 military veterans 
marched in uniform and stopped in front of the New York Stock Exchange, 
standing in loose formation as officers on scooters separated them from 
the entrance.

New York City Mayor Bloomberg said it was time for protesters to start treating their Manhattan neighbourhood with respect, reported the New York Daily News.

‘No one should think that we won’t take actions that we think are appropriate when we think they are appropriate,’ he said in a press conference.

‘This isn’t an occupation of Wall Street. It’s an occupation of a growing, vibrant residential neighbourhood in lower Manhattan.’

In 
Boston, college students and union workers marched on Bank of America 
offices, the Harvard Club and the Statehouse to protest the nation's 
burgeoning student debt crisis.
