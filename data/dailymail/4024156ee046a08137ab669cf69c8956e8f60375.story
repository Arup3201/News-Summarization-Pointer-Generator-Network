After more than eight years in charge, Chris Moyles has certainly made a lot of friends as well as enemies along the way.

And an array of stars were at BBC Broadcasting House today to help the departing Radio 1 breakfast host - known for his controversial outbursts on air - go out with a bang.

Former Doctor Who star Billie Piper and Geordie comedians Ant and Dec were there in London, along with Moyles’s long-time friend Davina McCall, Pixie Geldof and fellow host Sara Cox.

It came as the DJ told listeners he had joined with chart stars Rizzle Kicks in the studio to create a knockabout track in which they exchange banter, poking fun at each other's ages.

The Mama Do The Hump hitmakers were also 
guests on his show today as Moyles, 38, hosted his penultimate breakfast
slot in front of more than 200 listeners.

He welcomed a series of special guests
on the show and his team presented video montages looking back at his 
period of more than eight years in charge of the prestige morning 
programme.

Ant and Dec 
hosted a spoof edition of This Is Your Life on the show. And Channel 4's
Million Pound Drop Live presenter McCall said: 'I'd like to think I'm 
your number one celebrity fan’.

Actress Piper, who is soon to turn 30, 
said she first met Moyles when she was just 16. ‘It's been a long time 
and I love you,’ she said.

Rizzle Kicks performed live - singing When I was a Youngster, with Chris dancing on stage - and Pixie Lott ended the show with a reworking of her hit All About Tonight, titled 'All About Chris Moyles'.

Among the famous figures and past 
guests from his stint on the show - the longest ever for a Radio 1 
breakfast host - was his predecessor Cox.

She told him: ‘When I got fired, I wouldn't want anyone else to take over but Chris. In all seriousness, it was hard at first.

‘But
I've gone from a begrudging fan to a massive fan to a friend. I'm going
to miss you. You've been there through three kids and a divorce. For 
lots of people you've been there for their own journeys.’

Moyles - one of the corporation's 
highest paid presenters - joked that his departure would leave a huge 
hole in the schedules, but would save the BBC a huge amount of money.

Talking
about his track with Rizzle Kicks, he said it was supposed to feature a
series of joking insults which they traded about their relative ages.

But Moyles said he struggled to think of any appropriate put-downs for the pair - who are both 20 years old.

'I'll never forget the memories we've shared. So best wishes from me and happy new chapter'

Cheryl Cole

Recalling the recording he said: ‘”You're
so old that you're in black and white”, or whatever - and I go “you're 
so young ....”. There's no you're so young jokes.

‘For literally ten minutes, they ripped me to pieces – “you're so young you've never heard of Morecambe and Wise”.’

Gary
Barlow, one of his fellow trekkers during a Comic Relief challenge to 
climb Mount Kilimanjaro, also attended. He said: 'We had great fun but there was a really big girl amongst us – him (Chris).'

And Cheryl Cole - another of the
stars from that trip - sent a message of support. ‘I'll never forget 
the memories we've shared,’ the singer said. ‘So best wishes from me and
happy new chapter.’

'I'm going to 
miss you. You've been there through three kids and a divorce. For lots 
of people you've been there for their own journeys'

Sara Cox

Moyles
apologised to another guest James Corden for missing his stag party 
recently. Corden said: ‘We had a very very nice time, but this isn't 
about me. Shut up.’

He said he would miss the breakfast team like ‘a group of mates who you just happened to be in a car with’.

But
Corden added: ‘Rather than being sad about it, we should just celebrate
that I don't know whether anyone else will do the breakfast show on 
Radio 1 for this long.’

joked that he ‘only listened to the last five minutes’.

'It's been a long time and I love you'

Billie Piper

Recalling being asked by Moyles to 
record his voiceover, veteran TV star Walker - former host of ITV's 
Catchphrase gameshow - said: ‘He said to me: “Roy, there's not much 
money in it” - and that was true – “but it will make you a legend”.

‘And he did. I managed to save your show - and now it's on to The X Factor,’ he joked, referring to the ITV1 talent contest's flagging ratings.

Moyles will bow out from the show for a final time tomorrow. Fellow Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw is to take over the programme later this month.
