The Queen Mother warned against sending Prince Charles to boarding school in Scotland because she thought he would be miserable, a collection of previously unpublished letters reveal.

She asked the Queen not to send the prince to Gordonstoun, in north Scotland, as he would feel ‘terribly cut off and lonely’.

Charles’s grandmother said he should go to Eton instead, as not only was it much closer to home but also ‘staunchly Protestant’.

But Prince Philip ruled that his eldest son would attend his old school – and Charles later described the multi-denominational school as ‘Colditz in kilts’.

The Queen Mother’s letter of 1961 questioned the diverse religious ethos of Gordonstoun, which was founded by an experimental German-Jewish educator.

She said: ‘It’s always a tricky one with the heir to the throne’, and going to Eton ‘would solve many difficulties, one being religion’.

The correspondence is included in Counting One’s Blessings, a recently published selection of the late Queen Mother’s letters compiled by William Shawcross.

The warning proved to be prescient as Charles hated the tough regime at the Scottish school, which included cold showers and morning runs all year round.

In a letter home in 1963, he wrote: ‘The people in my dormitory are foul. Goodness, they are horrid. I don’t know how anybody could be so foul.’
