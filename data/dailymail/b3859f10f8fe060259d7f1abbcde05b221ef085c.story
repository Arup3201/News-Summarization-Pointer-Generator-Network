These incredible kaleidoscopic-style photographs capture England's churches and cathedrals in all their glory.

The series of vertical panoramas, taken in churches all over the country by travel photographer Richard Silver, showcase the buildings' stunning patterns and designs.

The 52-year-old, from New York, began his panoramic project in 2012 and has since travelled across England including Wells, London, Salisbury, Brighton, Bristol, Bath and Glastonbury to document the architecture of churches.

Richard Silver has spent the last two years taking photographs inside England's churches and cathedrals. Pictured: Southwark Cathedral (left) and Salisbury Cathedral

Despite looking rather different on the outside, Southwark Cathedral (left) and Salisbury Cathedral (right) have remarkable similarities on the inside (top pictures)

He has created the vertical panoramas to showcase the buildings' architecture and ornate ceilings. He was inspired to start the project after taking a vertical panorama in New York but chose to focus the project in England. Pictured: Farm Street Church in Mayfair, London (left) and Our Lady and St. Philip Neri, also in London (right)

Farm Street Church in Mayfair, London (left) and Our Lady and St. Philip Neri, also in London (right) are two of the dozen churches in the capital to be documented

Mr Silver, 56, takes dozens of photographs inside each building before piecing each one together digitally to make one giant vertical panorama. Pictured: The interior of Bath Abbey (left) and All Hallows by the Tower in London (right) are just two of the several buildings captured on camera by Mr Silver as part of his two-year long project

Mr Silver has travelled across the country including the Priory Church of St Bartholomew in West Smithfield, London (left) and St Thomas Church in Salisbury (right)

The Priory Church of St Bartholomew in West Smithfield, London (left) and St Thomas Church in Salisbury (right) were the dozens of churches visited by Mr Silver

Mr Silver said he hoped the images 'make people look at look at things in a new way.' Pictured: St. Sepulchres, London (left) and St Paul's Church, Brighton (right)

As well as looking different from the inside, St. Sepulchres in London (left) and St Paul's Church in Brighton (right) also look rather different from the outside too

He said he embarked on the project to show-off the often 'overlooked ceiling of a church' in the hope of making 'people look at look at things in a new way.'

He said: 'Much of the beauty in churches is above you.

'It made sense to start with England, since the country has such a deep history with religion and churches.'

The photography technique involves taking multiple photographs which are digitally stitched together to create one seamless image.

Once a shoot is complete, Mr Silver pieces his photographs together in Photoshop and the finished panorama consists of between five and nine images.

St John's Church in the Hyde Park area of central London (left) and St John the Evangelist Catholic Church in Bath city centre (right) have remarkably different interiors

Pictured: St John's Church in the Hyde Park area of a bustling central London (left) is a stark comparison to St John the Evangelist Catholic Church in Bath (right)

St James's Church in  Paddington, London (left) and Temple Church in London (right) are a further two churches chosen in the capital to document by Mr Silver

The differing interior of St James's Church in Paddington, London (left) and Temple Church in London (right) is matched by their rather different exteriors

St Clements Danes in London (left) is rather white inside with gold detailing, whileSt Bartholomew's Church in Brighton (right) shows off an authentic brick interior

Pictured: The exterior of St Clements Danes in London (left) is rather grand compared to the humble-looking St Bartholomew's Church in Brighton (right)

He said: 'I was surprised at the beauty of the smaller town's churches and blown away at how many churches there were in London alone.

'I planned my daily walks around the locations of the churches I wanted to photographs.

'I'm not a very religious man, but I still find the absolute beauty in the architectural design of these structures.'

'Many times people cannot figure out exactly what they are seeing. I tell them beforehand that it's a church and they still look a bit baffled.

'I love when that happens.'

St John's Church in Glastonbury is rather idyllic (Ieft), meanwhile the Chapel of St Gregory and St Augustine  (of which Mr Silver photographed the interior, above right) is situated in Westminster Cathedral, central London (right)

Richard Silver, who is originally from New York, has spent the last two years taking photographs inside churches and cathedrals in England. Pictured: Wells Cathedral

The 52-year-old said he chose to capture the beauty of England's buildings because the country is steeped in history and religion. Above: The exterior of Wells Cathedral
