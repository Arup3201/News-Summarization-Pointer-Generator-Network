Willie Mullins aims to pair champion jockey Ruby Walsh with Ballycasey in the Grand National on April 11 as the trainer pins his sole hopes in the big one at Aintree on the outsider.

Mullins withdrew his other potential runners Boston Bob and Prince De Beauchene on Tuesday.

But the Irishman believes the conditions and slower pace at Aintree should suit Ballycasey, even if the bookmakers and punters don't see it the same way.

Trainer Willie Mullins believes Ballycasey (right) will go the distance at Aintree but the bookies don't agree

'I presume, all being well, that Ruby will ride,' said in The Guardian. 

'He loves that type of ground they usually get, he should go the trip and I think he's a better horse in the spring. We think he's got a nice weight.'

The last time Walsh rode Ballycasey, in the Ryanair Stakes at the Cheltenham Festival, the Irish jockey  pulled the eight-year-old up. 

'He didn't fire on the day and Ruby wasn't happy with him from early on,' said Mullins. 'Perhaps the slower pace of the National will suit him. We're hoping he'll be better on a flatter track.' 

Retiring 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy will likely ride Shutthefrontdoor in the Grand National

Ballycasey is at around 50-1 with mainstream  bookmakers and up to 100-1 while  Shutthefrontdoor, the likely ride for 20-time champion jockey AP McCoy, among the early favourites with Rocky Creek, Balthazar King and The Druids Nephew.

Walsh famously won the Grand National at his first attempt in 2000 on Papillon, trained by his father Ted Walsh, and last tasted victory there over 30 fences for Mullins in 2005 on Hedgehunter.
