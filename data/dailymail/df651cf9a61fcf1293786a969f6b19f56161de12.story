A talented 18-year-old Maine student who died in February after a routine dental procedure was killed by a rare flesh-eating bacteria, a medical examiner has ruled.

The death of Benjamin LaMontagne was a result of complications of necrotizing fasciitis after having surgery to remove two impacted wisdom teeth, Mark Belserene of the medical examiner’s office concluded.

The Long Island teen died at home in his mother's arms on February 22.

His obituary listed the cause of death as complications from oral surgery, according to The Bangor Daily News.

Tragic: Talented high school musician Benjamin Edward LaMontagne died in his mother's arms in the early hours of February 22 after contracting a rare bacterial infection following a routine dental procedure

Commonly known as 'flesh-eating bacteria', necrotizing fasciitis ravages muscles, fat and skin tissue.

It typically enters the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut or scrape.

Necrotizing
 fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but
 extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to 
something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy 
skin, muscles and fat.

The
 disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a 
minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that 
kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so 
virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms
 include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading 
bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock 
are also common complications.

Sufferers
 must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given 
powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can 
become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. But about
 a quarter of victims will lose their lives to the disease.

The disease can be caused by several types of bacteria, most commonly group A Streptococcus.

Infections from group A strep are usually easily treated, but in some cases produce toxins that can destroy the tissue they infect.

Dr. John Molinari, infection control expert for the American Dental Association, said they are extremely rare.

'I have not heard of anything like that, with necrotizing fasciitis as a result of routine oral surgery extractions,' he said.

Dentists and oral surgeons follow well-established protocols to limit infection, including sterilizing instruments with heat and wearing gloves, masks and eyewear, which takes care of the 'overwhelming majority of what could happen', Molinari said.

Benjamin's mother Lynn first called for assistance around 1am on Saturday February 22 when Benjamin had stopped breathing.

The teen had reportedly suffered some typical swelling and pain following the procedure and by Friday it had intensified.

But by the early morning hours, he was dead.

Dr
 Thomas Dodson said that in 20 years of surveys at the Massachusetts 
hospital he used to work at, not a single death was recorded in patients
 who had wisdom teeth extracted.

The dentist, who is chair of the Department of Oral
 
and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle, 
had not reviewed Benjamin's case but has decades of experience.

'I’m

 trained as an epidemiologist, and I can’t say I’ve even ever read 
[about a death] anywhere,' he told the Portland Press Herald.

'The best part about him was that he did his own thing, he went his own way,' said LaMontagne's closest friend Christian Cilley (left). 'You could either jump on the train or watch it fly by'

The
 Long Island community where Benjamin's family live were left 
reeling by the unexpected death of the honors student who had been 
accepted at Pennsylvania's Sunderman 
Conservatory of Music.

The teenager, who played bass clarinet and enjoyed jazz, was a dedicated student who also enjoyed sailing and lobster fishing.

'If anybody could say they had a 
complete life after 18 short years, it was Benjamin, which makes it all 
the more painful to have him taken from us so soon,' Benjamin's father Peter LaMontagne told the Portland Press Herald.

His school friend Christian Cilley, who would often busk with Benjamin in town, said: 'The best part about him was that he did his own thing, he went his own way.'

The
 18-year-old fished for lobsters from his skiff and over the summer had 
worked on a lobster boat.

But music was his main passion, and he was one
 of only two students to have received the merit scholarship for Sunderman Conservatory.

Music teacher Julia
 Frothingham, who taught Benjamin bass clarinet for six years at Cheverus
 High School, said: 'I know he’s not my son, but I feel like I watched 
him grow up. I’ll miss not being able to see where he goes from here.'
