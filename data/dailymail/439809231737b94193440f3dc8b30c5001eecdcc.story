Family reunion: Jennifer Jones will be reunited with her children

Four children at the centre of an international tug-of-love battle will be reunited with their mother.

Briton Jennifer Jones went on the run with the youngsters during a bitter custody battle with their Spanish soldier father.

The English language teacher vanished in October after losing an Appeal Court ruling to prevent them being returned to Spain.

But 30 hours later she was arrested after being found 50 miles from her home in Gwent, south Wales.

Her two youngest children Eva, 10, and David, eight were immediately returned to their father Lieutenant Colonel Tomas Palacin Cambra in Majorca, where her eldest child Sara, 16, had remained.

But in a dramatic twist it emerged that Jessica, 14, and Tomas, 12, refused to go and sought legal advice in a bid to remain in Britain. They have been in local authority care since then.

In a bid to strengthen their case, the Jones family released a series of letters and cards suggesting that the children were scared of their father.

Last night, a High Court judge ruled that the two children could be returned to Miss Jones, 46, albeit temporarily.

Sitting in the Family Division, Mrs Justice Theis said that the future of Jessica and Tomas needed further consideration.

But she said the youngsters, who she has met, could return to their mother while litigation continued, having spent more than a month in care.

She said: ‘Both children continue to express strong wishes to remain with their mother.’ After the ruling, Miss Jones, who will collect her children this, said: ‘I’m so very pleased but there’s a long way to go yet.

‘I love my children so much.’ The judge’s decision is the latest stage in a long-running dispute between the children’s divorced parents.

Spanish courts granted Colonel Cambra custody of the children after his 12 year marriage to Miss Jones ended in 2008.

In June, four of their five children came to stay with Miss Jones for a summer holiday but did not return.

They started schools whilst their mother launched a legal battle to keep them in the UK.

But in October, the Family Division of the High Court ruled the children should be returned to their father.

After this failed to happen, High Court judge Mr Justice Roderic Wood made a public appeal for their whereabouts and ruled that the children should be taken from her home by police and social services.

But when they arrived, Miss Jones, her partner John Williams, a builder, 48, and the four children had packed up and gone.

After this, Colonel Cambra, 52, flew to 
Wales with his eldest daughter to collect all of the children but only 
returned with two of them.

He has since accused his former wife of turning their children against him as this is not the first time his wife has abducted their children. He has vowed to keep on fighting to keep his children together.

Colonel Cambra wants Mrs Justice Theis to enforce the Spanish court ruling but Miss Jones says the enforcement process should be ‘stayed’, claiming the children do not want to go back to Spain and should be in her care permanently.

The judge says it is too early to consider a ‘stay’ and is still considering the ‘question of enforcement’.

Miss Jones met Colonel Cambra when he was a young soldier while she was teaching English in Spain.

They were married in 1996 and lived in the Canary Islands and Ibiza but frequently returned to Llanelli to stay with Ms Jones’s family.

The hearing will continue in mid-December.
