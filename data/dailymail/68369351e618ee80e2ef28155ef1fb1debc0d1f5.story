She's only just unveiled her debut clothing range for Very.co.uk but style savvy Sam Faiers, who shot to fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has already got other projects in the pipeline. 

Sam, who is continuing her transformation from reality TV favourite to style entrepreneur, told MailOnline she's working on a secret project.

The 23-year-old revealed: 'Next month I am launching a new eyelash range, which is amazing. They’re stocked on Very as well.

'After that, I’d like to continue designing - maybe venture into accessories and beauty more as well and keep up with modelling. I have a really exciting fitness project coming up as well.'

Floral delight: Sam Faiers debuts her collection for Very in her own designs, including this figure-hugging blue, pink and red body-con dress complete with a lace hem. Items are on sale from 30 October

Speaking about the inspiration behind her new designs, she said: 'I was inspired by my style, which is often quite girly so there’s lots of cute babydoll dresses, floral prints and flirty skirts. 

'Saying that, I have been working with a stylist who has been pushing me to try new things and I definitely took this into account when approaching my collection so there’s tailored back trousers and cute tops.

'We are also coming into the party season so there’s lots of glam pieces perfect for dressing up and looking gorgeous in.'

There are 17 pieces in Sam's girlie range, with items including figure-hugging body-con dresses, embellished tops, jumpsuits and stylish separates.

The pieces range from £25-£65 in sizes 8 to 20, and they're all available to buy on Very.co.uk from 30 October.

In the campaign shots for the digital department store, Sam positively glows while modelling her self-confessed glamorous clothing, with her hair worn down and wavy. 

The TV star, who recently split from her on/off ex-fiance Joey Essex, combined two of the chic dresses in her collection with chunky black ankle boots, adding a modern, edgy vibe to the styling.

Although this is the former TOWIE starlet's debut range for Very - who also has Fearne Cotton on its roster of showbiz designers - it's not the first time she has tried her hand at fashion.

She, along with  younger sister and business partner Billie, launched a range of clothing back in 2011 called GraciEve, an offshoot from her Brentwood-based store and online shop Minnie's Boutique.

Sam Faiers' collection for Very is available to buy online from 30 October.
