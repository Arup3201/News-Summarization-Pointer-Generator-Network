Herman Cain has said he will make a decision about whether to continue his White House bid over the next few days - and it depends on what his wife says.

Cain, whose bid has been blighted with accusations of sexual harassment, said the decision depends on how much more his wife Gloria, whom he hasn't seen since his latest accuser surfaced, can bear.

A top-tier candidate just weeks ago, Cain says he'll decide in the next 'few days' whether to abandon his White House bid, but not before he meets Gloria tomorrow.

Final say: Herman Cain's wife Gloria has supported her husband, but he said the accusations are taking an emotional toll on her. His decision on whether he will stay in the presidential race now hinges on what she says

'It has had a very damaging effect on her emotionally, because of the way some of the story has been presented,' he said of his wife of 43 years during an interview with Fox.

'She gets upset when she sees the implications and the distortions by some people in the media.'

The former businessman added he cannot be certain there will not be another allegation.

'I can’t sit here and say, after 
working in the business for 40 years, that someone else may not come up 
with another trumped-up charge,' he said. 'This is about bring down 
Herman Cain.'

The disclosure came after he ripped into his critics yesterday for their 'character assassination' during three campaign stops in Ohio.

He said: 'They want you to believe that with enough character assassination on me that I will drop out.’

His comments drew a chorus of 'boos' and shouts of 'No' from the crowd.

He gave no indication to the audience that he was considering abandoning his bid despite telling staff that he would make a decision in the next few days about whether to continue it.

'We are reassessing as we speak. Reassessment means reevaluation,' Cain told reporters after a well-received speech to roughly 150 people in a hotel meeting room.

Cain received a standing ovation 
after he spoke about what a 'Cain administration' would do. And he said 
that while some people predicted that the room would be empty, 'I don't 
see any empty seats.'

Not without a fight: Herman Cain vowed during campaign stops in Ohio today that he will not be pushed out of the race by 'character assassination' by his critics

'It's
 been a groundswell of positive support,' Cain insisted to reporters 
later, even as some backers in early voting states of Iowa and New 
Hampshire who had stuck by him after decade-old allegations of sexual 
harassment surfaced several weeks ago now indicated they were abandoning
 him.

Also yesterday, the woman who claims she had a 'very casual affair' with Herman Cain insisted that their relationship was not 'sex for cash' - and said she does not believe the former Godfather's Pizza CEO is fit to be president.

Ginger
 White stood by her allegations of a 13-year relationship in a TV 
interview this morning, despite Cain's denials. She called the 
relationship an 'on and off' affair.

Ms
 White told ABC's Good Morning America that a letter sent by Cain to his
 fundraisers Tuesday night - in which he called the Atlanta woman 
'troubled' - is 'very disappointing'.

Should I stay or should I go? Herman Cain says he needs to weigh up whether accusations that he had an extramarital relationship will create too much of a cloud in the minds of potential supporters

Elaborating on her claims of an affair, White said: "This was not a consistent love affair that went on every day for the last 14 years. So he is correct when he made that statement.'

But Ms White also said Cain gave her gifts and money consistently over the last few years, although she claimed the relationship wasn't a matter of 'sex for cash.'

She claimed she didn't want to profit from the Herman Cain scandal, but Sharon Bialek may now want to reconsider.

Sharon Bialek, the first woman to go public with sexual harassment accusations against the Republican presidential candidate, faces eviction from her rented townhouse in a Chicago suburb, authorities said on today.

Cook County Sheriff's deputies served a court summons on Tuesday evening on Bialek's Glenview, Illinois, home due to nonpayment of $7,500 in back rent. The owner of the home has begun eviction proceedings, a sheriff's spokesman said.

Bialek, a single mother who identified herself as a registered Republican, was not home when deputies arrived.

Her 13-year-old son signed the court summons, which was witnessed by her brother-in-law, the spokesman said.

Once a front-runner in the race to challenge President Obama in 2012, Cain denied Bialek's November 7 accusations.

As far as providing further proof of her story, she said: ‘You really don't enter into something like that holding on to receipts, holding onto gifts or notes or anything like that.'

According to Ms White, she took several trips with Cain, even attending a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas.

When asked if she believes Cain should drop out of the race, Ms White said: 'That’s something that he has to look himself in the mirror and ask himself.

'Last night, I slept very well telling the truth. I'm not sure what's going on in his head right now but it’s unfortunate that any of this is going on.'

Meanwhile, Cain's campaign manager has dismissed reports the embattled presidential contender is planning to withdraw from the race.

The Republican businessman dramatically revealed to senior staffers yesterday he is 'reassessing' his campaign amid allegations of a 13-year extra-marital affair - the latest in a series of cheating accusations.

However, Cain’s campaign manager, Mark Block, said the word was 
meant to imply a 'strategic reassessment' and 'not a reassessment of 
withdrawing' from the race.

As ABC News reports, Mr Block said in an interview yesterday evening there is 'no way he's dropping out'.

Coming forward: Ms White, an Atlanta businesswoman, she was only coming forward because she was afraid someone would tell her story first

He began defending himself before the
 allegations even surfaced. He broke the news himself on CNN that Ms 
White would make claims against him.

As well as an alleged relationship with Ginger White, Mr Cain has been accused of sexual misconduct by four other women:

Cain's
 lawyer said in a statement: 'This appears to be an accusation of 
private, alleged consensual conduct between adults - a subject matter 
which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public.'

The statement, however, does not explicitly deny the affair.

In an interview with Fox 5 in Atlanta on Monday, Ms White said she was only coming forward because she was 
afraid someone would tell her story before she herself could.

'I'm not proud,' she said. 'I did not want to do this. I did not.'

As proof of the lengthy relationship, Ms White offered her mobile phone, which has Mr Cain's private number.

Ms
 White also showed mobile phone records dating back four months that 
have 61 phone calls and text messages to or from Mr Cain as early as 
4.26am and as late as 7.52pm.

'He made it very intriguing,' Ms White 
told FOX 5. 'It was fun. It was something that took me away from my 
humdrum life at the time. And it was exciting.'

Going on: Mr Cain said he knew the woman as a friend but did not have an inappropriate relationship with her

Mr
 Cain has been accused of sexual harassment by four other women, two of 
whom have come forward publicly with their allegations.

However,
 to this point, the only accusations were about inappropriate advances 
or comments. Ms White is claiming that he cheated on his wife for more than a 
decade

'It was pretty 
simple. It wasn't complicated,' she told the TV station. 'I was aware 
that he was married. And I was also aware I was involved in a very 
inappropriate situation, relationship.'

Mr Cain has been married to his wife Gloria since 1968. Both have vehemently denied allegations of sexual harassment.

And Mr Cain's denial of the new allegations were similarly complete.

'I
 just wanted to give you a heads up and your audience a heads up, "Here 
we go again,"' he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Situation Room.

'Here we go again': Herman Cain went on TV to deny the allegations that he had an affair... before they fully emerged

The Georgia native said he knew Ms White as an 'acquaintance who I thought was a friend.'

He denied having an affair, instead saying he tried to help her with financial problems.

Cain also deflected criticism and said the allegations were part of an extended conspiracy to keep him out of office.

Ms White said the two met in 
Louisville, Kentucky, in the late 1990s when Mr Cain was the president 
of the National Restaurant Association.

That night, she says, Mr Cain took her out for drinks and then invited her up to his hotel room.'I'd
 like to see you again. You are beautiful to me, and I would love for us
 to continue this friendship,' Ms White claims Mr Cain told her.

From
 then, he paid for her to fly to his speaking engagements across the 
country, where he put her up in fancy hotels and restaurants like the 
Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons.
