On her television shows, she is often seen launching a late-night fridge raid for dishes she has lovingly prepared earlier.

But in reality, Nigella Lawson binged on junk food including Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's and Domino's pizza, her former aides claimed yesterday.  

The TV cook is said to have gorged on takeaways after getting the 'munchies' following late-night bonding sessions with her teenage daughter Cosima, known as Mimi.

Mood swings: The sisters claim they struggled to cope with Nigella's mood swings - describing her as a 'Duracell bunny' one minute and a 'zombie' the next

Lifting the lid: Sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo have revealed what it was like working for TV chef Nigella Lawson

The revelations followed Miss Lawson's admission in court that she smoked cannabis 'with or in front of' Mimi, who is now 19.

The
 53-year-old, whose best-selling cookery books include How to Eat: The 
Pleasures and Principles of Good Food, could also devour two giant bars 
of chocolate a night, according to her former aides Francesca and 
Elisabetta Grillo.

The 
sisters gave an account of family life inside the £15million  London 
townhouse that was wildly at odds with the lifestyle portrayed in Miss 
Lawson's popular television programmes.

Elisabetta
 told The Sun: 'The kids were forever ordering takeaways and cooking 
microwave meals and Pot Noodles in their rooms. For Nigella, staying up 
late with Mimi was a bonding experience, a special time where the two 
girls could talk.

Change: Nigella's former assistant Francesca Grillo claims the chef went from being extremely nice to absent and grumpy

'They 
loved takeaways – McDonald's, Domino's pizza, Chinese, KFC, Wagamama 
[Japanese noodles], fish and chips. It was surprising how much takeaway 
food they ate given her reputation as a fabulous cook using only the 
best ingredients.'

She 
added: 'Nigella was always more of a friend with Mimi than a mother.  
She was off working when Mimi was young so she saw their chats as a good
 chance to get to know her daughter – to reconnect with her. They were 
like two college students giggling in the lounge.'

Mimi
 is Miss Lawson's eldest child from her marriage to journalist John 
Diamond, who died of cancer in 2001. During her court evidence, Miss 
Lawson said she smoked cannabis in the final year of her marriage to 
Charles Saatchi to help cope with an 'intolerable situation' but denied 
being a habitual user.

The 
Grillo sisters, who have worked for her for more than a decade, said 
they noticed several changes in her behaviour as her second marriage 
collapsed, including mood swings, an obsession with psychics and 
appetite changes.

Elisabetta, 41, said: 'Nigella never had a sweet tooth before but in the last year she would gorge on treats.

'She
 would munch her way through two big chocolate bars a night at one 
point. I guess it was comfort eating as the cracks were starting to 
show. She was stressed and could never relax or sleep.' 

Francesca,
 35, said Miss Lawson suffered from insomnia, and took anti-depressants 
and Xanax, a prescription tranquilliser used for panic attacks. 'She'd 
be this hyperactive Duracell bunny buzzing round the house.

'But
 then she wouldn't be able to sleep and would turn into a zombie. She'd 
talk to herself, mostly gibberish, and say to us, “Just ignore me, I'm 
not making sense today”.'  

The sisters claim that Nigella's mood got worse in the last 18 months of her marriage to Charles Saatchi, pictured outside court

The TV cook also installed a state-of-the-art ventilation system to hide the smell of her junk food binges, Francesca revealed.

She said it pumped perfumes into every room in the Chelsea townhouse.

'She
 had fragrances for different rooms,' said Francesca. 'In their former 
homes she would light expensive, scented candles. But at some point, she
 thought the candles weren't strong enough.'
