This year is set to be the 10th warmest on record, say meteorologists.

Climate researchers in the UK said that temperatures in 2011 were nearing the top of records dating back to 1850.

This despite a 'strong and persistent' La Nina weather system in the Pacific - an effect which should lead to lower temperatures across the world.

The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) released the figures based on three sets of independent data, including a joint one from  the University of East Anglia (UAE) - currently mired in controversy - and the Met Office, at a climate change conference in Durban this week.

However, only last week researchers at UAE were criticised for colluding with politicians to ‘massage’ evidence of man-made climate change after 5,000 emails were leaked online.

‘It’s part of a natural climate oscillation in the tropical pacific,’ says Adam Scaife, senior climate scientist at the Met Office.

‘It oscillates between the warm El Nino phase – El Nino is Spanish for “the boy”– and the cold La Nina phase.

‘La Nina is the cold “little sister” phase. It’s a purely natural event that occurs every few years as part of this natural oscillation.

‘During La Nina, the rainfall that normally falls over the Pacific, shifts west over Indonesia and the northern and eastern parts of Australia.

‘La Nina effects weather patterns throughout the globe, but the further away from La Nina you are, the more difficult it is to pinpoint the effects.’

The WMO released the figures as 200 nations meet in Durban, South 
Africa, for the latest UN talks on agreeing a deal to tackle climate 
change.

The organisation, whose data also includes figures from the U.S., put the global 
average temperature at 0.41C above the 1961 to 1990 average of 14C, 
making it the 10th warmest on record.

According to the WMO, the 13 warmest years on record have all occurred in the 15 years between 1997 and 2011.

The Met Office/UAE also suggested a long-term warming trend in the global climate.

Their data shows the average global 
temperature for January to October 2011 was 14.36C, 0.36C above the 1961
to 1990 long-term average of 14C.

The WMO's final figure is an average of the three sets of data.

According to their researchers, each decade since the 1950s has been warmer than the 
previous decade, and last year was one of the warmest on record.

Peter Stott, head of climate 
monitoring and attribution at the Met Office, said: ‘This year we have 
seen a very persistent and strong La Nina, which brings cooler water to 
the surface of the Pacific Ocean.

‘This has a global impact on weather 
and temperatures, and is one of the key reasons why this year does not 
figure as highly as 2010 in the rankings.

‘However, global temperature so far 
this year is likely higher than it was in the La Nina events in 2008 and
1999 to 2000 - indicating a continuing warming trend combined with 
natural variability.’

Professor Phil Jones, director of the 
Climatic Research Unit at UEA, said that natural variations from year to
year meant that every year would not be warmer than the last.

But he said: ‘Independent researchers 
analysing long-term trends of these indicators have seen an increase in 
air, sea and land temperatures, rising sea levels and decreasing Arctic 
sea ice, spring snow cover in the northern hemisphere and glacier 
extent.’

The global temperature figures come as
scientists warned the latest evidence was showing that global warming 
appeared to be a greater, rather than lesser, problem.

Brian Hoskins, director of the 
Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London and 
professor of meteorology at Reading University, said: ‘What we've seen 
in the science is not one huge change but a number of things - the 
melting of the ice sheets, the permafrosts and release of methane and 
the carbon cycle - have tended towards this problem being more serious 
rather than less.’

As negotiators meet in Durban to 
discuss efforts to tackle climate change, he said it was important to 
get a global deal on curbing greenhouse gases that would see emissions 
peak around 2020 and begin to fall by around three per cent a year.

He said: 'There's no doubt that what the 
climate system feels is the total greenhouse gases we emit to the 
atmosphere, so unless countries can agree it's very difficult to see how
we can cap the total which is what the climate feels.

‘That's why a global agreement is so important.’

The WMO report also said 2011 saw 
Arctic sea ice reach the second-lowest extent of cover on record during 
the summer melt, and its lowest ever volume in the summer months.

The report said Russia suffered 
another hot summer, while central America was on course to have its 
hottest year for 140 years and France and Spain had their hottest 
January to October on record.

But in Australia temperatures have 
been up to 1C lower than normal in places, while eastern China and 
Korea, the western U.S. and south-western Canada also had below average 
temperatures in 2011.

Severe drought in East Africa was 
followed in October by heavy rain and floods in some places, while 
south-east Asia also suffered major floods.

In the U.S., there were 14 separate 
weather and climate events which caused losses of $1billion (£650million) or more each, with the country hit by a range of problems
including drought in Texas, Hurricane Irene, October snowstorms in 
the north-eastern states and one of the most active tornado seasons on 
record.

Many parts of western Europe saw the 
driest spring on record and it was also very warm, with the UK 
experiencing a spring that was 1.8C warmer than normal.

'Climategate' at University of East Anglia

More
than 5,000 documents were leaked online last week purporting to be the 
correspondence of climate scientists at the University of East Anglia 
who were previously accused of ‘massaging’ evidence of man-made climate 
change.

Following on from the original 
'climategate' emails of 2009, the new package appears to show systematic 
suppression of evidence, and even publication of reports that scientists
knew to to be based on flawed approaches.

And
not only do the emails paint a picture of scientists manipulating data,
government employees at the Department for the Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs (Defra) are also implicated.

The University of East Anglia, where most of the emails originated. None of the newly released emails appears to be post 2009, but clarify the extent of government involvement in the scandal

One message 
appeared to show a member of Defra staff telling colleagues working 
on climate science to give the government a ‘strong message’.

The
emails paint a clear picture of scientists selectively using data, and 
colluding with politicians to misuse scientific information.

‘Humphrey’,
said to work at Defra, writes: ‘I cannot overstate the HUGE amount of 
political interest in the project as a message that the government can 
give on climate change to help them tell their story.

'They want their story to be a very strong one and don’t want to be made to look foolish.’

Professor
Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit at the centre of the
affair, said the group findings did stand up to scrutiny.

Yet one of the newly released emails, written by Prof. Jones  - who is working with the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - said: 'Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of 
the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden.

'I’ve
discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past 
and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.'

Clive Crook, a commentator for the 
Atlantic, who described the earlier inquiries into the Climategate 
emails as 'ineffectual' and 'mealy mouthed', reportedly said: 'The closed-mindedness of these supposed men of science, their 
willingness to go to any lengths to defend a preconceived message, is 
surprising even to me.

'The stink of intellectual corruption is 
overpowering.'

The
release of the information echoes the 'Climategate' leaks 
of hacked private emails two years ago ahead of crunch climate talks in 
Copenhagen that referred to ways to ‘hide the decline’ in global 
warming.

A series of 
independent reviews cleared the East Anglia researchers of impropriety, 
but they were told they had been too secretive.
