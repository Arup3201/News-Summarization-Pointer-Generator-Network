A female scientist has been experimenting with beauty competitions and her results prove she's got a formula for success.

Alice Ford, 21, spends her days in a white coat studying for her degree in molecular biology but in her spare time she gets dressed up to walk down the catwalk at beauty pageants.

So successful is Alice that she has beaten 40 other girls to win the coveted title of Miss Wales and a shot at the Miss World contest later this year.

Beauty AND brains! Alice Ford, a 21-year-old molecular biology student, has been crowned Miss Wales and is hoping to win the Miss World crown when she competes later this year

Speaking about her passion for her studies, Alice said: 'My first love is genetics and the theory behind it. I’m hoping to go into medical research as that’s what I’m really fascinated in.

'But I was encouraged to enter a beauty contest and I loved it because its so different to life in the laboratory.

'To win the Miss Wales title is a thrill - I am enjoying every minute of it.

'My friends are so proud of me - they keep asking me to wear my sash when I’m out with them.'

Alice first started taking part in beauty pageants while studying for her A-Levels in her home city of Cardiff.

Best of both worlds: Alice says genetics is her one true love but believes that with the right time management, she can balance her studies with modelling

She turned down a modelling contract to concentrate on her studies at Cardiff University, where she is in her second year.

Her ambition is to be at the forefront of medical research into new drugs to tackle some of the world’s most deadly diseases.

But for now she has the Miss World final, being held in London in September, in her sights.

She said: 'People think it’s a bit strange when they find out my passion is molecular biology.

Winner: Alice beat stiff competition from 40 other girls to win the coveted Miss Wales crown

Hopeful: A spokeswoman for the Miss Wales contest described Alice as 'not just a pretty face' and said that she stands a great chance in Miss World

'But I don’t see why you can’t be a scientist and a beauty queen at the same time.

'It’s all about time management and structuring your time to ensure you can fit everything in.'

She was crowned Miss Wales at a glittering ceremony at the Princess Royal Theatre in Neath Port Talbot.

A spokeswoman for the Miss Wales contest said: 'Alice is not just a pretty face - she stands a great chance in Miss World.'

Big plans: Alice, who spends most of her days studying in a lab coat, hopes to help cure deadly diseases one day

Strong minded: 'I don't see why you can't be a scientist and a beauty queen at the same time,' said ambitious Alice
