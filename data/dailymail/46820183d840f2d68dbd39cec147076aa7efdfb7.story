Mesut Ozil has been a maligned figure at times in his Arsenal career but the attacking midfielder's dominant display in the 5-0 victory over Aston Villa was one of his best yet on these shores.

The 26-year-old was almost flawless at The Emirates; his intricate passing combined perfectly with Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey in midfield while his movement in the final third was clever,  causing confusion in a Villa defence that was concerned enough with the speed of Theo Walcott.

It took only eight minutes for Ozil to show he was on form.

Ozil's heat map in the attacking third of the pitch was impressive, particularly down the left of the pitch

As his German counterpart Per Metersacker hooked the ball clear from the penalty area and into the direction of Ozil, who was just inside his own half, the midfielder took a small glance to his left as he turned towards the high ball.

The look sent Olivier Giroud running, and Ozil stuck his left leg out to artistically flick the ball into the path of the onrushing striker, who closed in on Brad Guzan and lifted the ball over him for Arsenal's lead.

It was a sublime touch to send the ball gliding through the Villa back line and an ominous sign for Paul Lambert that with one swish of Ozil's left boot, his side's defence was unlocked.

After half an hour, Ozil capped a fine passing move with Santi Cazorla by guiding the ball beyond Guzan, but his strike was ruled out for offside.

It was a tight decision but the World Cup winner, who hit the opening goal when Arsenal beat Villa 3-0 in September, was not to be nullified for the duration of the encounter.

He doubled Arsenal's lead on 56, Giroud this time the provider by playing a neat ball into the run of the attacking midfielder for him to tuck the ball beyond Guzan and into the far corner.

It was the goal his performance had merited, but neither he nor Arsenal were done.

Seven minutes later, Walcott finished brilliantly from the edge of the penalty area to signal his own return to form and fitness after injury, before a Cazorla penalty squirmed away from Guzan and Hector Bellerin curled in from range in the final minute.

But the performance of Ozil will be most encouraging for manager Arsene Wenger.

Today, Ozil played with the authority of a World Cup winner and the style of a man who cost £42.5million.

Arsenal are outside of the top four and have plenty of work to do to secure a Champions League place, so the return of Ozil is timely.

He has made no secret of the fact he has hit the gym in order to be able to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League and after recovering from a knee injury  against Chelsea sustained in October that ruled him out until last month, today's performance could signal an upturn in his fortunes  at Arsenal.
