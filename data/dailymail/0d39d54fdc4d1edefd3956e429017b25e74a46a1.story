Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is in good humor after being airlifted from a cruise ship in the Galapagos Islands by the Ecuadorian Navy to undergo emergency kidney stone treatment in the U.S.

'Galapagos: five stars. Kidney stones: zero stars,' Bezos joked in an email to Reuters.

Local websites in Ecuador were the first to break the news of Bezos' health scare. Galapagos DigitalÂ  reported today that the new owner of the Washington Post was flown by helicopter from a cruise ship off Santa Cruz Island to Baltra Island after suffering a kidney stone attack on New Year's Day.

From there he took his private jet back to the United States to receive treatment.

Juan Ibarra, the captain of the helicopter, told El Comercio that Bezos was vacationing on the islands.

Captain Daniel Ginez Villacis, the regional director of the islands Coast Guard, said Bezos' family and business friends thanked the navy for their quick rescue.

According to the Mayo Clinic, most kidney stones don't require surgery and can be passed by drinking water, pain relievers or other medicine.

Larger stones cause more serious symptoms like bleeding, kidney damage and urinary tract infections and need to be removed by doctors.

The 49-year-old is worth an estimated $25.2billion, making him the 19th richest man in the world according to Forbes.

He founded Amazon in 1994, writing the business plan on a cross-country road trip from New York to Seattle.

Bezos is married to his wife MacKenzie and they have four children together.
