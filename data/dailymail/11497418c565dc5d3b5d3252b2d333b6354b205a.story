They had earned a trophy and a promising title shot, but there was an appropriate lack of rejoicing by England on Saturday night. Wastefulness is no cause for euphoria.

The Calcutta Cup had been retained, but the limitations of the opposition meant that was never in real doubt, despite considerable Scottish tenacity and occasional artistry.

Stuart Lancaster, his assistants and his squad know that the standards they reached at Twickenham will not suffice against the leading rugby nations.

1st minute: George Ford sends Luther Burrell clear but he ignores Anthony Watson in space on the right and the door slams shut.

13th minute: Ben Youngs frees Mike Brown but the full-back — minus a boot — is chased down by Stuart Hogg close to the posts.

15th minute: The pack drive a scrum towards the Scottish line but Billy Vunipola is unable to pick up and touch down.

17th minute: Jack Nowell storms clear with two team-mates on either side but goes it alone, slips and cannot offload the ball.

31st minute: Burrell bursts through and sends Watson scorching to the line, but the ‘try’ is ruled out ny Romain Poite for a forward pass.

54th minute: Rampant England swarm into the visitors’ 22 but the attempted offload by Geoff Parling is pinched by Blair Cowan.

56th minute: Replacement hooker Tom Youngs makes a dazzling midfield charge but it comes to nothing as his pass flies between two supporting runners.

58th minute: Watson breaks from a ruck to the opposition 22 but runs away from Burrell and cannot release the centre to score.

62nd minute: Brown blasts over the Scottish 22 to score, but the ‘try’ is disallowed due to another forward pass in the build-up — this time by James Haskell.

While the Red Rose is now planted at the top of the RBS Six Nations table, even shambolic France may be no push-overs in the tournament finale at Twickenham next Saturday if there is not a sharp up-turn in English precision.

‘If you look at the All Blacks, when they create a line break they usually end up scoring,’ said Lancaster. 

‘We created 12 line breaks, which is a huge positive because I haven’t seen any team pull Scotland apart like that, but to only come away with three tries is frustrating. I think the players know that.’

They most certainly do. Ben Youngs was named man of the match for his efforts at scrum half, but he appeared underwhelmed by the manner of the victory.

‘We got what we wanted in terms of the result, but the scoreline should have been better,’ he admitted.

There is a recurring concern for England. Composure — or a lack of it.

They mustered plenty in Cardiff to turn the tide against Wales, but too often in tight games there are failures of decision-making or execution.

The tone was set on Saturday by Luther Burrell, who didn’t manage to pass to the unmarked Anthony Watson on the Scottish 22. Put him in a Northampton shirt and the centre would surely make the pass and create the try. Yet, on this high-profile occasion, the chance was squandered.

A similar error of judgment by Jonny May against Italy cost the Gloucester wing his place in the match-day squad, but Burrell is likely to escape the same fate due to the absence of injured Brad Barritt and reservations about Billy Twelvetrees.

The Saints player was not the sole offender, with Jack Nowell at fault for ignoring support more than once. It may seem churlish to criticise the Exeter wing, who was dynamic and dangerous, but England urgently need a clinical edge.

‘It’s that composure after the line break,’ said Lancaster. ‘It was good on some occasions because we scored three good tries, but there were also missing elements and we need to fix those for next week.’

Jonathan Joseph continued his purple patch by touching down for the fourth time in as many games. But he was left irritated by the hosts’ profligate streak, too.

‘We made costly errors in the red zone in their 22 which let them off the hook,’ said the Bath centre. ‘We are creating those opportunities, now it’s just a matter of finishing them.’

England must not over-state their satisfaction at mere creation alone. On the one hand, Wales’ victory over Ireland was a source of great English joy, as it leaves Lancaster’s team with it all in their favour in the three-way tussle for the championship title.

But with the bigger picture in mind, the red-shirted defensive heroism in Cardiff rammed home the need for England to become more ruthless. Soon. On the latest evidence, their closest World Cup Pool A rivals won’t be line-break fodder in the way Scotland so often were.

No other country can match the All Blacks’ ability to expose and seize the jugular, but Lancaster will be painfully aware that his team cannot rely on a torrent of attacking possession.

When England are equalled or trumped up front — as was the case against Ireland — they will require an executioner’s instinct.

At least it was evident in one man on Saturday. George Ford wielded the conductor’s baton with staggering assurance for a 21-year-old. He invariably took the right option while going through his wide-ranging repertoire in helping to conjure the tries by Joseph and Nowell. He added one himself when the fractured Scottish defence opened up in front of him.

Joseph, his club-mate at Bath, said: ‘I have played with George since Under 18s and he has always been that kind of player who thrives under pressure and more or less always delivers. He has been outstanding for us in the Six Nations.’

Five days from now, England can win the title using their home advantage and the benefit of playing last and by preying on simmering French doubts. But if ‘Le Crunch’ turns out to be a tense duel after all, they also need others to follow Ford’s lead by finding the mental conviction to make the right calls.

The wastefulness can’t go on, or next time there may not be a trophy to soften the inquest.
