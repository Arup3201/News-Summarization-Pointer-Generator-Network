An outbreak of hepatitis A linked to a frozen berry mix sold at Costco has grown to 87 people across eight states.

Illnesses have been reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Washington, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The Food and Drug Administration and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have linked the illnesses to Townsend Farms Organic Anti-Oxidant Blend, a mix of berries and pomegranate seeds produced by Townsend Farms in Oregon.

Outbreak: Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend of frozen berries sold through Costco stores

The company recalled the product from stores last week. So far the illnesses have only been linked to the berries sold at Costco.

Craig Wilson, director of food safety at Costco, said the store is providing vaccinations for people who ate the berries within the last two weeks and is reimbursing others who have gotten the vaccine elsewhere.

The store has contacted about 240,000 people who purchased the berries at one of their stores, Mr Wilson said.

The company knows who bought the berries because purchases are linked to a membership card that customers present when they check out.

The Food and Drug Administration is investigating the cause of the outbreak.

The CDC said the strain of hepatitis is rarely seen in North or South America but is found in the North Africa and Middle East regions.

Townsend Farms has said the frozen organic blend bag includes pomegranate seeds from Turkey. Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that can last from a few weeks to a several months.

People often contract it when an infected food handler prepares food without appropriate hand hygiene.

The CDC said that food already contaminated with the virus can also cause outbreaks, as is suspected in this case.

Illnesses occur within 15 to 50 days of exposure to the hepatitis A virus, CDC said. Symptoms include fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, abnormal liver tests, dark urine and pale stool.

Vaccination can prevent illness if given within two weeks of exposure, and those who have already been vaccinated are unlikely to become ill.

CDC said the illnesses date back to mid-March. The same genotype of hepatitis A was identified in an outbreak in Europe linked to frozen berries this year as well as a 2012 outbreak in British Columbia related to a frozen berry blend with pomegranate seeds from Egypt.

The agency said there is no evidence the outbreaks are related. Lawsuits have already been filed against Townsend Farms in California, Colorado, Hawaii and Washington state, with more expected in the other affected states, according to a spokesman for Seattle-based food safety lawyer Bill Marler.

The class action lawsuits ask for compensation for the treatment and also reimbursement for the vaccines.
