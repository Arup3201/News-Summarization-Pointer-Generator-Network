A benefits cheat who conned taxpayers out of thousands of pounds while selling £125 burgers in a gourmet gastropub begged not to be jailed – because he is too fat.

Bentley-driving Stephen Sussams, 59, fraudulently claimed nearly £15,000 in housing and council tax benefit but argued he should not be sent to prison because he is obese.

Matthew Groves, defending, told Croydon Magistrates’ Court that a custodial sentence 'would be a great burden for him to carry 
because of his ill health', which includes 'diabetes, heart disease, 
hypertension, obesity and depression'.

But Judge Peter Gower ignored the plea on Friday and ordered that Sussams, who also stole £17,000 from a dead man’s bank account, be jailed.

Sussams was the landlord of The Royal Dart pub in Dartmouth where customers dined on crocodile, impala and ostrich while a champagne-marinated burger meal with black truffle costs £125.

But the court heard how he began stealing £17,600 from the account of an elderly man he used to care for just one day after he died.

He withdrew funds from Keith Dickenson’s account in five instalments following his death in 2008, before taking over the tenancy of his house in Croydon for which he fraudulently claimed housing and council tax benefits until September 2011.

Carers’ supplements also continued to be paid into Mr Dickenson’s account, for which Sussams was a signatory, after he died because the benefit cheat did not inform the authorities of his death.

As Sussams continued to withdraw funds from the dead man’s account, Croydon Council grew suspicious and investigated.

Sussams, of Marston Way, Norbury, denied
four counts of benefit fraud and one count of theft, but was found 
guilty after a trial.

Sentencing Sussams to eight months’ imprisonment for the count of theft, Judge Gower said: 'Your claiming of these benefits was fraudulent from the outset and you failed to notify the council of the highly successful business you were running in Dartmouth.'

Referring to money he stole from the bank account of a dead man, he added: 'It is clear from the outset that you knew full well that was money the council had mistakenly paid into the account of Keith Dickenson after he died.

'I have no doubt that you knew that money was intended by the council to cover the cost of providing care services to him appropriate to the level of his disability and knew it was no longer needed for that purpose.

'Instead of returning these you applied them in accordance with your own wishes.'

Sentencing him to a further four months for the counts of benefit fraud, he added: 'Your claim for these benefits was fraudulent from the outset.'
