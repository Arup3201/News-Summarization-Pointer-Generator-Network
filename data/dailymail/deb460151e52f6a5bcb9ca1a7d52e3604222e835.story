A little boy smiles as he holds an assault rifle as if it were a harmless toy.

This shocking photograph was posted on Twitter by the child’s British mother, who is so proud of him that she has put the snap on her profile page.

No older than three or four, the youngster is seemingly being groomed to join the ranks of the Isis extremists in Iraq. For him, a game of soldiers involves messing around with an AK-47 rifle.

According to an investigation by The 
Sunday Times, the boy named Isa – the Arabic version of Jesus – is the 
son of a former London student and her Swedish husband.

He also has a younger brother, aged about 12 months, who his mother refers to as a ‘mini mujahid’, or holy warrior.

The
 family are said to be living in Syria and are disciples of the Isis 
cause. Isa’s mother calls herself Umm Isa (Mother of Isa) and her 
Twitter name is Muhajirah fi Sham, which means ‘immigrant in Syria’.

She
 is married to a Swedish Islamic fighter called Abu Bakr and is reported
 to be a convert who previously attended a mosque in South London.

Fight: On Twitter, the child's mother complains that not enough fellow Muslims have joined the Isis cause in Syria. Above, militant Islamist fighters take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa province

The
 British woman was featured on a Channel 4 News clip last year firing an
 AK-47 and a revolver in Syria. She claimed to have studied media, film,
 psychology and sociology in Britain.

At
 the time, her husband was attached to a foreign fighters’ brigade, part
 of which later merged with Isis. It is unclear when Umm Isa travelled 
to Syria and whether her older son was born there. She has said she has 
no plans to return to the UK.

On Twitter, Umm Isa has also shared a photograph of an Isis crucifixion and boasted about witnessing a public execution.

In
 one post, using barely comprehensible text speak, she complains that 
not enough fellow Muslims have joined the Isis cause in Syria.

It comes after Salma (left) and Zahra Halane (right), who last summer 
achieved 28 GCSEs between them, left their parents’ home in the middle 
of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border 
to Syria

She 
wrote: ‘Wer [where] r all da  sisters dat want 2 join us in Sham [Syria]
 nd marry nd support a mujahid? Wer r all da brothers dat r spose 2 b on
 da front line?’

Her 
neighbour, another British woman who uses the alias Umm Khattab 
al-Britaniyya, has also shared the photograph of Isa carrying a rifle, 
commenting: ‘Look at my little mujahid, this kid is the funniest man, 
love him.’

Umm Khattab 
started a Twitter account on June 27 —the day after 16-year-old twins 
Zahra and Salma Halane went missing from their home in Manchester to 
head for Syria.

She later tweeted: ‘Missing twins – chilling with one of
 them now.’

The woman also claimed that she had met ‘many British girls’ since arriving in Syria.

About
 500 British Muslims are thought to have gone to fight in Syria, despite
 religious leaders appealing to them not to travel to the war zone.
