Watford boss Oscar Garcia has been released from hospital and could be back at the club later this week.

The 41-year-old Spaniard left hospital on Sunday, a week after he was admitted suffering from chest pains.

Garcia, who only took over at Vicarage Road three weeks ago, has since missed the Hornets' 1-0 win at Blackpool and Saturday's 1-1 draw against Bournemouth, which should have been his first home match in charge.

Watford would not put a time frame on his return on Saturday, but now say they hope he will be back on the training ground before next weekend's trip to Blackburn.

A statement on the club's website read: 'The club is pleased to confirm that head coach Oscar Garcia left hospital yesterday (Sunday).

'At this stage, the Hornets expect Oscar to hopefully return to work later on this week.'
