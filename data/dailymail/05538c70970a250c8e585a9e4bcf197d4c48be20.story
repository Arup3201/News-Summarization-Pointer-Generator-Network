Fairfax Media is set to merge its radio business with arch rival Macquarie Radio Network, which owns 2GB with host Alan Jones, in a deal worth more than $18 million

Veteran 2GB radio hosts Ray Hadley and Alan Jones are expected to remain with the company despite the deal.

Fairfax chief executive Greg Hywood said the deal would generate cost savings and more attractive propositions for advertisers.

'The merger creates a genuine national talk radio network that was not previously available to advertisers,' he said. 

'The merger provides both cost and revenue synergies from enhanced network and sales opportunities that will create a more efficient and effective network for news, talk and sports radio along with music stations.'

The merged network will be led by Macquarie's current chief executive Russell Tate as executive chairman. Another Macquarie nominee, two Fairfax nominees and one independent director will also take up places on the board.

In a separate deal announced on Monday, Fairfax will offload its Perth radio station 96FM to APN News and Media for $78 million.

The companies will aim to finalise the deal by March 2015.

Macquarie will have to sell 2CH and the Macquarie Regional Radio Network as part of regulatory requirements of the merger.
