England 'never doubted' Alastair Cook would remain as captain for the 2015 World Cup, according to Jimmy Anderson.

Paceman Anderson hailed Cook's show of character to disregard widespread calls for his head as skipper and lead England to Test series victory over India.

England bosses last week confirmed Cook's place as one day captain for next year's short-format World Cup, with 50-over series to come against Sri Lanka, Australia and India.

Anderson admitted that off-field distractions hurt England in a battling Test summer against Sri Lanka and India, but said opening batsman Cook remains the right skipper.

Jimmy Anderson said that England never doubted that Alastair Cook would remain as captain

'For us it was never a question really, it was all speculation with the captaincy,' Anderson told Press Association.

'From the players' point of view we never thought anyone else was going to lead us to that World Cup, we never doubted.

'For him I think he's had more low points than most this summer, the amount of chat that was going on about his captaincy in the Test matches then the one-dayers.

'So to show the character he has to come through those, it speaks a lot about the guy.

'It was a huge test of character: it's a credit to himself the way he's handled it all.

'I'm sure he had a lot of doubts in his mind of whether he should have captained the Test team or the one day team.

Despite speculation he may be removed as captain, Cook will lead England in the upcoming World Cup 

'But all I can say is from a player's point of view there was never any doubt over who should be captain.'

England started their summer with a dismal 1-0 Test series defeat to Sri Lanka before grinding back to form to dispatch India 3-1.

England have lost five of their last six one day series, but Anderson still insists the 29-year-old Essex batsman is the ideal figurehead.

'The person who will benefit most is Cooky of course, because the players had no issue with who was going to be captain,' said Anderson, speaking at the Professional Cricket Association's awards night.

'So for him it's nice that chat won't be a distraction now.

Alastair Cook's England side lost both their home 50-over series this summer against Sri Lanka and India

'From that point of view when the distraction of people talking about it goes, it's a good thing for us.

'It's a really exciting winter, with the World Cup at the end.

'The two series we've got, in Sri Lanka and then against Australia and India, it should give us a good chance of preparing well for the World Cup.

'It's an exciting prospect for any player, so all the players are going to do their utmost to get in the World Cup squad.

'There were quite a few distractions throughout the summer, and the way we dealt with it, especially going one-nil down to India then coming back, it was a huge response for us.

'The one day series as it was, with questions being asked about the captaincy, as players we just got on with it.

'Things like that are down to the selection panel not the media.

'We're really excited about the winter and hopefully we can put in a good show.'
