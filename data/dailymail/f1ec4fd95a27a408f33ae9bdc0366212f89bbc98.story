A mid-flight death forced the grounding of an Air New Zealand flight in Los Angeles for several hours Friday.

The woman, yet to be identified, was described as middle-aged and on holiday with her husband, Stuff reports.

She collapsed during the NZA flight for as-yet undisclosed reasons.

A female paramedic who happened to be a 
passenger on the flight worked on her for roughly an hour and a half 
with crew members but were unable to revive her.

'By the time we landed, I think there was little more that could be done,' said one Kiwi eyewitness, who declined to be named.

The
 plane was then on the tarmac for roughly two hours with passengers as 
the crew waited for a coroner's van to arrive for the body.

The long wait was likely due to the Fourth of July holiday.

'Normal process was followed and the coroner was notified,' an Air New Zealand spokeswoman told reporters.

The spokeswoman declined further comment citing privacy concerns.
