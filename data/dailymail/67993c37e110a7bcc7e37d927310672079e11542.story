The first family has not bought a house in Asheville, North Carolina, the White House said Monday, clamping down rumors started by a financial media company's website which claimed it had an iron-clad confirmation of the future move.

Given Barack Obama's frequent trips there before and during his presidency, the rumor mill spent all day Monday spinning.

He visited Asheville last year, speaking at an auto parts plant owned by Linamar Corp. to advocate for a minimum wage hike the day after his State of the Union address.

Obama has visited the trendy city of just 85,000 people three other times since his first presidential campaign. It was his debate-preparation retreat before going toe-to-toe with Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008. He took his family there for an April 2010 vacation. And he made a pitch there for jobs in 2011.

But asked Monday if the Obamas had bought property there, White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest shot back: 'That is not true.'

Anyone need a wide runway? Obama spoke at the Asheville airport in 2011 about how useful it would be to put North Carolinians to work making the tarmac broader and the taxiway more manageable

The 12 Bones Smokehouse restaurant in Asheville is a barbeque landmark that Obama mentioned by name during his 2013 visit -- and which he visited with the first lady in 2010

The rumor made lots of sense: Obama smiled on the 10th fairway at the Grove Park Inn Resort in Asheville during a round on April 23, 2010

You could have fooled the president, judging from his past banter in Asheville.

'It is good to be back. I love coming to Asheville,' Obama said on February 13, 2013, during his most recent jaunt there.

'Michelle and I always talk about how if – after this whole presidency thing – we're looking for a little spot ...'

'Come on down!' came a shout from the crowd, finishing his thought.

The president reminded his partisan audience of something they already knew: Western North Carolina is known as a laid-back tourism hub.

He said he might 'play a little golf, do a little hiking, fishing, barbecue' if he ever moved in.

'There are two things that keep bringing me back here,' Obama said then. 'Number one is I really like the people. Number two is 12 Bones [barbecue], which I’ll be stopping at on my way back to the airport.'

Asheville is also famously liberal, serving as a politically progressive oasis in a historically red state and housing a sizable community of artists and galleries.

There is also the occasional drum circle.

'We have lots of what are known here as "Trustifarians," an Asheville real estate agent told MailOnline, requesting anonymity 'in order to not offend anyone.'

'These are pretty ordinary rich kids with trust funds who like to play at being hippies.'

'But they pay top dollar for lovely properties, so we certainly welcome them even if these are their second homes,' she chuckled.

The agent said she wasn't in the loop on an Obama move to the area, first reported by Wall Street Cheat Sheet, but thought it might have improved property values.

'Lots of 
the president's fans are going to want to move here if it's true,' she 
told MailOnline. 'But I bet the Secret Service will mean no one wants to
 live on his street.'

All I can tell you for sure, she laughed, is that they're not buying the Biltmore.'

During a February 13, 2013 speech in the western North Carolina town of Asheville, Obama had said that he and Michelle might move there 'if, after this whole presidency thing, we're looking for a little spot'

Man of the people: Obama will have lots of opportunities to fetch his own coffee beginning in 2017, as he did Monday on the spur of the moment -- but the Secret Service may have to work hard to blend in wherever he moves

Out of the question: The Biltmore Estate, America's largest privately owned home, is in Asheville -- but while the Obamas have toured it, no one thought they were in the market for a 250-room, 178,926 square foot mansion

That was a reference to the 250-room mansion completed in 1895 for the wealthy Vanderbilt family.

The nation's largest privately held home is now a tourist attraction – one that the Obamas checked out in 2010.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment about the potential real estate purchase.

But during an October 17, 2011 speech at Asheville's airport, Obama argued that one of his make-work jobs programs could help improve the modest transportation mini-hub.

'There is plenty of work to go around,' he said 'In this airport right here in Asheville, you’ve got a runway that needs to be widened and repaired.'

'You’ve got a taxiway that’s in the wrong spot – which means that planes sometimes get too close together. So we could be doing some work right here at the Asheville Airport that would help boost tourism, help to boost the economy here, put people to work right now.'

Obama, the rumor held, could have been going in and out of that airport on a regular basis in just a few short years.

The website AskAsheville.com quickly published a Buzzfeed-style list on Monday of the top 10 reasons Obama was supposedly moving there.

'"Mayor of Asheville" sounds cool,' one item read. 'Wouldn’t that be the perfect gig for an ex-President?'
