Officials in Montgomery County, Texas, said they stand by the child abuse charges they filed against Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson, arguing the injuries to his four-year-old son exceeded normal disciplinary measures. 

Peterson, 29, surrendered to authorities early Saturday after flying to Texas from Minnesota and was released after posting a $15,000 bond.

'Obviously parents have a right to discipline their children, except when that discipline exceeds what the community thinks is reasonable,' assistant district Attorney Phil Grant told the Houston Chronicle on Saturday. 'It wasn't that he just used a switch.'.

Indicted: Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson, smiling in this booking photo, reportedly admitted to police that he gave his son a 'whooping'

The grand jury, which indicted Peterson on Friday for reckless or negligent injury to a child, concluded that the incident was 'unreasonable discipline'.

Meanwhile the NFL, which is reeling from its second public outcry about player misconduct in as many weeks, said Peterson would be disciplined under the league's personal-conduct policy. 

The Vikings said he wouldn't be playing in Sunday's game against the New England Patriots and that it is reviewing the matter. 

The 2012 NFL MVP admitted to police that he gave his son a 'whooping' last May with a switch - a term he used to describe a leafless tree branch - on two occasions as a form of punishment while the boy was visiting him in Houston.

Peterson said the boy pushed another one of his children off a motorbike video game they were playing. The player then grabbed a tree branch, removed its leaves and struck the child repeatedly, leaving cuts and bruises over many parts of his body, including on his buttocks, legs and scrotum. 

He then reportedly texted the boy's mother about the incident, saying that one wound in particular would make her 'mad at me about his leg. I got kinda good wit the tail end of the switch,' according to CBS.

In further text messages, the football star said he 'felt bad after the fact when I notice the switch was wrapping around hitting i (sic) thigh' and that he “got him in nuts once I noticed. But I felt so bad, n I’m all tearing that butt up when needed! I start putting them in timeout. N save the whooping for needed memories!' 

He also texted the boy's mother: 'Never do I go overboard! But all my kids will know, hey daddy has the biggie heart but don’t play no games when it comes to acting right.' 

The child offered police a different version of events, telling them Peterson hit him on the face and that he feared further punishment for talking to the authorities about what happened.

He said that he had been hit by a belt and that 'there are a lot of belts in Daddy’s closet.' 

The boy also said that Peterson put leaves in his mouth when he was being hit with the switch while his pants were down and told his mother that his dad 'likes belts and switches' and 'has a whooping room.'

Peterson's lawyer, Rusty Hardin, said Peterson is cooperating fully with investigators.

'Adrian is a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son,' according to a statement from Hardin.

'He used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas. Adrian has never hidden from what happened. He has cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours.'

The statement adds that Peterson 'deeply regrets the unintentional injury'.

In fact, Peterson didn't think there was anything wrong with his actions when he was interviewed by police, telling them he only used 'whoopings' or spankings as a last result. 

When asked if some of the marks on the boy's body were from an extension cord, he said 'Oh, no, I’d never hit my child with an extension cord. I remember how it feels to get whooped with an extension cord. I’d never do that', CBS reported. 

After Peterson's four-year-old boy returned home to Minnesota, his mother took him to a doctor, who found a number of lacerations on this thighs, bruise-like marks on his lower back and buttocks and cuts on his hand.

A police report obtained by a radio affiliate of CBS said the boy told the doctor that Peterson had hit him with a branch from a tree. 

A doctor describes some of the marks as open wounds and called it 'child abuse'. Another agreed and called the cuts 'extensive'. 

Peterson told investigators when they questioned him that he regarded the incident as a normal spanking and not excessive. 

A grand jury held in the summer had declined to charge him. A new one was impaneled in Montgomery County, Texas, and decided to pursue the indictment. 

In a statement, the Vikings said it was deactivating Peterson for this Sunday's home game against the New England Patriots. 

Peterson had plenty of fans and detractors on Twitter. 

Some thought what he did was nothing out of the ordinary.  

Others were less than kind. 

Another fan noted on Twitter that Peterson's image is featured on the tickets for the game this weekend, even though he won't be playing in it. 

The incident comes just 11 months after another son of Peterson's, Tyrese Ruffin, died in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after allegedly being beaten by the boyfriend of the child's mother. 

Peterson only learned about the two-year-old's existence two months before his death. 

Joseph Patterson faces charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault, and the trial is scheduled to begin next month. 

In July, Patterson pleaded not guilty to a second charge of assaulting Tyrese's mother  and holding her against her will for more than an hour.

Peterson reportedly has had seven children, including Tyrese and the four-year-old. 

Erica Syion, a former dancer from Dallas and mother of one Peterson's kids,  said in October that her son knows of 'four other brothers and sisters' but the total number of children remains unclear.
