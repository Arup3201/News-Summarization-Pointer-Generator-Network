Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair smile as they finally return home to France yesterday, despite warnings that the disgraced former IMF chief’s problems are far from over.

They arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris amid a storm of protest, led by the French First Lady.

Referring to the May sexual assault charges against him in New York being dropped, Carla Bruni told TF1 news: ‘I don’t understand how this whole business came to an end.

Happy to be back: The former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and wife Anne Sinclair arrive back on French soil

Former International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his wife Anne Sinclair leave the Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport in Paris this morning after a U.S. rape case against him collapsed

Welcome home: Strauss-Kahn and his wife beamed as they travelled down the escalator upon their first return to their native France since he was arrested in New York in May

‘I am a bit confused, and I simply 
detested all the machismo reactions that followed. When women are 
belittled and attacked, I tend to take their side and feel solidarity 
with them.’

Strauss-Kahn’s accuser, Guinean hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo, will now pursue a civil case.

The 62-year-old also faces another investigation in France over attempted rape, based on accusations by novelist Tristane Banon.

When they landed in France, a police escort was waiting to rush the couple through customs and into a waiting Peugot limousine.

French
detectives also indicated that they also intended to speak to Mr 
Strauss-Kahn about  sex-related accusations being levelled at him in 
Paris.

The couple on Saturday night left their the $50,000-a-month Manhattan town home Strauss-Kahn had rented for his house arrest and boarded the flight at John F.Kennedy International airport.

The  62-year-old lost his job as IMF 
chief after Diallo, a chamber maid at the Manhattan Sofitel, 
said she was attacked.

Strauss-Kahn
admitted having a sexual encounter with her, but his lawyers 
controversially argued that it has been a consensual one.

Strauss-Kahn, spent almost a week
in jail after being removed by police from a plane about to take off 
for Paris, six weeks under house arrest and nearly two more months 
barred from leaving the country before Manhattan prosecutors dropped the
case last week, saying they no longer trusted the maid.

Strauss-Kahn talks to his wife in the courtyard of their home. The 62-year-old lost his job as IMF 
chief after Nafissatou Diallo, a chamber maid at the Manhattan Sofitel, 
said she was attacked.

The couple are dwarfed by the massive entrance into their home. Strauss-Kahn admitted having a sexual encounter with the woman, but his lawyers controversially argued that it has been a consensual one

Diallo is continuing to press her claims in a civil lawsuit. Strauss-Kahn denies the allegations.

Strauss-Kahn has been free to travel 
internationally since his passport was returned late last week

He'd 
told reporters he was eager to return to France, but he first took a 
trip to Washington, DC, on Monday to bid farewell to former IMF 
colleagues at the lending agency's headquarters.

Until his arrest, Strauss-Kahn was 
considered the Socialist Party's front-runner to take on conservative 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy next year. Socialists have rejoiced in 
the dismissal of the criminal case against Strauss-Kahn, but few 
observers in France expect a political return from him anytime soon.

'This
is a man who has suffered. It is a man who will obviously take some 
time to get his bearings,' his biographer, Michel Taubmann said.

The maid is continuing to press her claims in a civil lawsuit but it's unclear if Strauss-Kahn will return to New York as defendants aren't required to go court dates

Face the music: Strauss-Kahn was met by a police escort at the airport and left in a waiting Peugot limousine which was chased by a media pack on motorcycles

Strauss-Kahn also will have to 
contend with a sexual assault allegation that surfaced in France after 
his New York arrest. Authorities are investigating novelist Tristane 
Banon's complaint that Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her while she was 
interviewing him in 2002 — an incident her mother, a regional Socialist 
official, has said she discouraged her from reporting at the time but is
now encouraging her to pursue.

Strauss-Kahn's lawyers have called Banon's account 'imaginary'.

And Strauss-Kahn still faces Diallo's
lawsuit in New York, though it's unclear when he might have to be in 
New York for the civil case. Lawsuits can take years to play out, and 
defendants aren't required to come to court dates, as they generally are
in criminal cases. She's seeking unspecified damages.

Leaving: Strauss-Kahn left the U.S. 112 days after he first tried to leave but was arrested on an Air France jet at Kennedy airport

Diallo,
33, says Strauss-Kahn chased her down in his suite and attacked her 
after she arrived to clean it. Prosecutors said DNA evidence shows they 
had a sexual encounter; his lawyers say it was consensual.

After initially portraying Diallo as a
compelling witness, prosecutors developed doubts about her credibility.

She had told them a concocted tale of having been gang-raped in the 
past, among other falsehoods about her background, and they said she 
gave varying versions of her actions immediately after her encounter 
with Strauss-Kahn.

'We simply no longer have confidence 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty,' prosecutors 
wrote in a court filing last week.

Diallo
has said she's telling the truth about being attacked. One of her 
lawyers, Douglas Wigdor, has said prosecutors' decision to abandon the 
criminal case 'is an affront to Ms. Diallo and to all victims who come 
forward in the future.'

It has also emerged that Ms Diallo 
could also testify against Strauss-Kahn in Paris. Her lawyer has filed a
complaint accusing Mr Strauss-Kahn’s staff of interfering with a 
potential prosecution witness.

The so far unnamed witness is a past 
lover of Strauss-Kahn who says he abused her while he was the mayor of 
the Paris suburb of Sarcelles.

Strauss-Kahn was already married to 
Ms Sinclair, his third wife, when he met the witness at a party 
organised by the French Socialist Party in 1997

They became lovers within hours, even though she was just 23 and he was 47, and went on to meet regularly for almost a year.

But when their secret affair ended badly she is said to have tried to commit suicide because of Strauss-Kahn’s abuse.

Paris-based barrister Thibault de Montbrial said he had filed the complaint in Pontoise, another Paris suburb, saying Strauss-Kahn’s legal team had ‘put pressure’ on the witness, including offering her money to remain silent.

This would amount to perjury, and could result in a prison sentence for those involved in the alleged cover-up of evidence, with Ms Diallo appearing in Paris as a prosecution witness.

It would also allow Ms Diallo’s legal team to rehearse their case against Strauss-Kahn in France, so opening him up to further prosecution.
