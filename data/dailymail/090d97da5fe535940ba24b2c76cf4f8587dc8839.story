Dishonest: Alan Lawson, 58, was jailed after claiming nearly £90,000 in benefits because of a crippling back injury while working as a fitness instructor

A benefit cheat who claimed he was unemployed and could barely walk was caught working as a council fitness instructor and teaching people how to lift weights.

Alan Lawson, 58, raked in nearly £90,000 over more than eight years claiming he suffered severe back and leg pain.

But he was jailed for eight months after investigators discovered he was working at Newton Aycliffe sports centre in County Durham and was instructing new members how to use weights.

Lawson,
of Newgate Street, Bishop Auckland,admitted benefit fraud totalling 
£88,008.

Durham Crown Court heard how he had to have back surgery in 1995 following an 
accident and had started claiming incapacity benefit legitimately.

He said he was unable to walk without 
the aid of a stick and could barely make it 100 yards without having to 
stop.

But he admitted failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of an improvement in his condition.

Susan Hirst, prosecuting, said: 'He 
said he was unable to walk without a stick, and suffered severe back and
leg pain after walking just a short distance.

'On a good day he said he could walk 100 yards if he stopped every 20 yards or so.

'He said he needed help getting out of bed, washing and dressing, plus other aspects of personal care.'

Miss Hirst said from September 2010 he also claimed housing and council tax benefit, as he was supposedly unemployed.

But, inquiries began after it emerged he had been working as a fitness instructor at the sports centresince October 2003.

Miss Hirst added: 'He was earning 
£200 a week, but he didn't declare it, or that his physical condition 
improved, to either the DWP or to the county council.'

'He
began working part-time to see if he could do the work. The hours 
increased and he said the years simply went by and he didn't report it.'

Ian West, defending, said: 'He's admitted he was wrong in continuing these claims. Effectively, he 'slid' into this offending.

'The accident left him unable to work, severely disabled and walking with two sticks.

'It was a big lifestyle change for him and, some in his position might have given up, and accepted life on benefits.

'He
got physiotherapy and acupuncture and it worked. His physical fitness 
got back to a position where he hoped he could get back to the world of 
work.

'He started by getting qualifications and doing fitness training.

'He
was never as fit as before, but he was able to go back to work 
part-time and was trying to see if he could ease himself back into 
full-time work.'

Mr West said Lawson only had to be able to instruct gym users how to use the equipment, but wasn't lifting weights himself.

Jailing him, Recorder Alistair MacDonald QC, told Lawson: 'It's ironic you say you battled back to some form of fitness.

'You said you didn't have to be as fit as your potential clients. You became ingrained in this dishonesty.

'Many
people are forced out of work but do not claim benefits to which they 
are not entitled. Every penny obtained fraudulently by you is a penny 
legitimately paid by taxpayers.'

Following the sentencing, a spokesperson for Durham County Council said: 'Alan Lawson no longer works for Durham County Council.

'The council takes benefit fraud very seriously and we investigate and assist with any investigations where any member of staff is suspected of falsely claiming benefits.'

John Carter, from the DWP, said: 'No-one should think they can get away with benefit theft.

'Our investigators track down those guilty of stealing money they are not entitled to, bringing them before the courts and making them face the consequences of their action.

'In addition to any sentence imposed by the court, the department always seeks to recover the money falsely obtained, to ensure that cheats do not benefit from their criminal activities.'
