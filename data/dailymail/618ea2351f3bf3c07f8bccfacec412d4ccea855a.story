A man who blamed ‘minorities and African Americans’ for rising crime in his neighborhood was arrested February 13 on charges of bank robbery after running back to that very same neighborhood.

Back in June, the Buffalo, New York CBS affiliate was covering an arson in the city’s Old First Ward neighborhood. A fire the FBI believed was set intentionally and with racist motivation.

Pot meet kettle: William Shanahan is charged with robbing a bank near the neighborhood he once famously said was over-run with criminal minorities

The station interviewed William Shanahan, a 30-plus-year resident of the area,  to get his thoughts on the fire.

Slimy irony: Shanahan, here in his mugshot, has been arrested multiple times but blames 'minorities' and 'African Americans' for crime problems

‘I think that if people just stayed on their own side of town in their own neighborhood that things like that wouldn't happen,’ Shanahan told WIVB.

The occupant of the burned home was a minority and a refugee who’d fled persecution in his home country.

‘Every race and color has their own section of Buffalo,’ Shanahan continued, smiling into the news camera. ‘So if they just stay in their own neighborhood, things like this wouldn't happen.’

Outrage over Shanahan’s comments immediately spread throughout Buffalo and western New York and sparked a dialog about race-relations in the region.

Shanahan even claimed he received death threats after his comments aired.

But at least one statement Shanahan made has undoubtedly come true.

‘Property value goes down,’ Shanahan griped. ‘Crime goes up.’

And he was right. Crime, it seems, very well may have gone up.

Old hat: Lt. Det. David Dudiziak says he's had over 50 run-ins with Shanahan and believes he robbed the bank for drug money

No shame: Shanahan robbed this bank, right around the neighborhood he told a TV crew was endangered by minority criminal elements

Shanahan was picked up in the very neighborhood he once claimed was imperilled by an influx of minorities after allegedly robbing a bank in nearby West Seneca, New York on February 13.

Charges against the Shanahan include burglary, attempted robbery, and petit larceny.

Ironically, they aren’t nearly the first crimes he’s been charged with in his neck of the woods.

Lt. Detective David Dudiziak of the West Seneca Police said he and his department have had many run-ins with Shanahan.

‘We’ve had,’ the detective told WIVB, ‘in excess of fifty contacts with him over the years.’

Detective Dudiziak believes Shanahan robbed the bank for drug money.
