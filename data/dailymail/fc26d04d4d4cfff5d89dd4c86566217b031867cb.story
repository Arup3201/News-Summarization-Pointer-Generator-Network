Chic in a navy blue coat and a matching hat, Zara Tindall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived for the first day of the Cheltenham Festival this morning.

Making the most of the Spring sunshine, the 33-year-old was all smiles as she strolled through the vast crowds with friends before taking a seat in a private box.

Topping off her look was a stylish cloche hat by milliner Rosie Olivia, which matched the bespoke dark wool coat by London Fashion Week favourite, Irish designer Paul Costelloe.

Sharing a joke: Zara was spotted enjoying a joke with her husband Mike Tindall, 36

The mother-of-one is a regular sight at Cheltenham and attended the races on all four days of the festival last year.

This year has an added incentive for Zara, whose Grand National horse Monbeg Dude is due to run later this week.

Purchased by husband Mike Tindall for £12,000, the horse finished in a respectable seventh place at Aintree last year - all the better given that Zara initially thought the animal was a dud.

Speaking ahead of last year's Grand National, she revealed that her initial response to Mr Tindall's purchase was to call him an 'idiot' but was later won over.

She has also helped to train the horse and has been building a career as a racehorse trainer, with several of her animals entered in National Hunt races this season.

Today, though, it was all about enjoying the races with the mother-of-one spotted laughing and joking from her perch in the box.

First to run were the competitors entered for the Sky Bet Supreme Novices Hurdle, which saw jockey Ruby Walsh triumph aboard Duveen.

Other highlights on day one included the Racing Post Arkle Challenge Trophy Chase and the big race of the day, the Stan James Champion Hurdle Challenge Trophy which was won by hot favourite Faugheen.

Wondering who to have a flutter on? Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge reveals which horses are set to be first past the post at this week's Cheltenham Festival.

TODAY - CHAMPION HURDLE

HORSE: Faugheen

ODDS: 11/10

He's called Faugheen the machine for a reason and it's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on Tuesday, despite the impressive field.

Usual jockey, Ruby Walsh, is yet to decide his mount for the race, with stablemate and dual Champion Hurdle winner Hurricane Fly also lining up, but with fingers pointing towards Faugheen it's just another reason to back him.

WEDNESDAY - QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE

HORSE: Dodging Bullets

ODDS: 4/1

All eyes might be on Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy, but Dodging Bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year's Festival, and although a short price the Clarence House Chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting.

THURSDAY: LADBROKES WORLD HURDLE

HORSE: Saphir du Rheu

ODDS: 9/2

Paul Nicholls' stranglehold at the top of the World Hurdle betting has tightened again following Rock on Ruby's withdrawal. It's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite, but with Saphir Du Rheu back over hurdles it can only be a good thing.

He gallops and jumps well, and his Cleeve Hurdle win shows he can do it at Cheltenham

FRIDAY - GOLD CUP

HORSE: Carlingford Lough

ODDS: 10/1

It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey.

There's still doubts whether favourite Silviniaco Conti can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy.
