More than 500 supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohammed Morsi have been sentenced to death in a ruling by an Egyptian court. 

The group, members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, were handed the sentences by the court in Minya, south of the capital, Cairo, today.

They have been convicted of a number of charges, including killing a police officer and attempting to murder others.

The ruling is a sharp escalation of Egypt’s crackdown on supporters of Morsi, which has seen thousands arrested and hundreds killed so far.

Morsi, who was ousted by the army in July last year following repeated demonstrations calling on him to leave, is now being held at a high security prison near the Mediterranean city of Alexandria.

The 529 Islamists sentenced to death are part of a larger group of 545 Morsi supporters who are on trial for a number of charges.

These include killing a police officer, attempting to murder two others, attacking a police station and other acts of violence.

More than 150 suspects stood trial; the others were tried in absentia. Sixteen were acquitted.

The ruling followed only two sessions in which the defendants' lawyers complained that they had no chance to present their case.

The alleged attacks are believed to have taken place during violent demonstrations after security forces broke up two pro-Morsi protest camps, killing hundreds of people.

Authorities have blamed the Brotherhood for the violence - branding it a terrorist organization and confiscating its assets.

However, the group has denied any links to the attacks.

‘The court has decided to sentence to death 529 defendants and 16 were acquitted,’ lawyer Ahmed al-Sharif told Reuters today.

The convicted Islamists are believed to be able to appeal the ruling.
