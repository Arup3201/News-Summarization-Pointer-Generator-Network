George Osborne today rejected pleas from refusenik Tory Cabinet ministers for another round of cuts to welfare to raise £11.5billion for 2015-16.

The Chancellor insisted tax rises and benefits cuts have raised enough money already, and warned other departments will not be let 'off the hook' by complaining about which areas are not being targeted again.

It came as Mr Osborne announced he has reached agreement with seven government departments on making extra cuts of up to 10 per cent, he ruled out returning to the welfare budget for more.

Chancellor George Osborne, who today addressed workers at the Port Of Liverpool during a visit to mark the start of the dredging of the River Mersey Estuary, has reached agreement on £1billion in cuts with seven government departments

Senior Tory ministers including Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson have resisted some cuts to their budgets, arguing benefits could be reduced further to protect the military and flood defences.

But Mr Osborne said major savings were already being made to benefits, and he would not let other ministers ‘off the hook’.

The Chancellor is understood to be delighted that seven departments have already signed off savings of up to 10 per cent, including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles who were reported to be resisting cuts.

A Treasury source said: 'We are impress by Eric and Chris. Clearly these are ministers who have put their money where their mouth is and are very serious about making sure every penny of taxpayers' money is spent effectively.'

The Chancellor warned ministers resisting cuts of up to 10 per cent that he would not go back to the benefits budget to raise money

George Osborne has reached agreement with seven of 24 departments on making savings of up to 10 per cent for 2015-16.

But
 they are relatively small in comparison to the big spending ministries 
like business (£13.8billion), education (£53.8billion) and defence 
(£24.5billion)

(All figures are budget totals for 2014-15)

However, Mr Osborne has made clear to
 other ministers yet to settle cuts will that he will not be diverted by
 calls for more benefits cuts.

The benefits cap, announced last year
 limiting increases in working age benefits to one per cent, is already 
due to raise £3.4billion in 2015-16.

Mr Osborne said: 'We are cutting welfare and we’re cutting welfare for the future as well.

‘We’re going to make sure that no family that stays at home on benefits gets more than the average family going out to work and we’re also making sure that welfare bills don’t go up faster than wages, so there are big savings in welfare.

‘But I would also say that’s not an excuse to let Whitehall off the hook.

‘We’ve also got to make savings there so we can fix our economy, bring that deficit down and spend on the things people want us to spend on like the NHS, like the infrastructure that’s going to create jobs in the future.’

Several Tory ministers have called for deeper cuts to benefits to help balance the books.

The under-25s would be barred from receiving housing benefit and families would only receive state help for their first two children under plans outlined by David Cameron last year, but rejected by the Liberal Democrats.

Nick Clegg's party has argued any further benefits cuts have to start with targeting handouts like the winter fuel allowance and free TV licence for very wealthy pensioners.

Business Secretary Vince Cable made clear that Liberal Democrats will resist further welfare cuts targeted at the poor, telling Sky News: 'Simply taking more off people at the bottom end of the scale is not the right way to proceed.

'The Liberal Democrats have said if we are going to look at entitlements, it's got to be people at the top that we start with.'

Deal: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers are among seven ministers to agree cuts of up to 10 per cent to their budgets

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today denied claims he had offered more benefits cuts to spare the armed forces and police.

Counter-terror budgets could be protected from cuts in the wake of the brutal killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week.

Chancellor George Osborne vowed he would not do anything to endanger Britain's security at home or abroad.

The Ministry of Defence and the Home Office are among departments told to find up to 10 per cent savings.

Mr Osborne was asked whether he could protect the budget for counter-terrorism.

He told BBC1's Breakfast: ‘We've been able to protect it in the past and I'm not going to do anything which is going to endanger the security of this country at home or abroad or the fight against terrorism, but that doesn't mean that you can't take a vast institution like the Home Office and look for savings.’

David Cameron's official spokesman told reporters the Prime Minister agreed with Mr Osborne's comments, but declined to confirm whether this amounted to a guarantee that the anti-terror budget would escape the axe.

The Daily Telegraph today reported 
that Mr Duncan Smith has personally contacted the Defence and Home 
Secretaries with an offer to cut the welfare bill by another £3 billion 
each year to protect spending on the armed forces and police.

But a spokeswoman for Mr Duncan Smith
 said: 'Iain has not had any special discussions about protecting the 
defence or security budgets. These measures were on the table at the 
time of the Autumn Statement.'

Next month Mr Osborne will set out 
departmental budgets for 2015-16, the financial year which spans the 
general election due in May 2015.

Under
 the spending review Mr Osborne needs to find £11.5billion in savings 
for 2015-16. At the Budget he announced £1.5billion had already been 
found.

Today he revealed he has now found £1billion from the first seven departments to agree their share of the cuts.

They
 include the Ministry of Justice, Foreign Office, Department for 
Communities and Local Government, Department for Energy and Climate 
Change, the Northern Ireland Office, the Treasury and the Cabinet 
Office.

However, it does not include big spending ministries like the Home Office or Ministry of Defence.

In the wake of the brutal killing of 
Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week, the police, armed forces and 
security services have stepped up their opposition to further cuts.

Defence
 Secretary Philip Hammond argued in March that there was a ‘body of 
opinion within cabinet who believes that we have to look at the welfare 
budget again’.

However, Mr Osborne ruled it out while insisting national security will be protected.

‘The key thing is to make sure we maintain our ability to defend ourselves at home and abroad, and of course that's an absolute priority for us.

‘That doesn't mean you can't find savings in the way these big departments operate, including the Ministry of Defence.’

Risk: Environment ministers have warned the Treasury that extra cuts could leave flood defences vulnerable

Resistance: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has warned more cuts to his budget could threaten flood defences while Defence Secretary Philip Hammond called for more welfare cuts to protect the armed forces

A defence source said Mr Hammond had 
agreed 'further genuine efficiency savings can be achieved' in his 
ministry and work was continuing with the Treasury and Cabinet Office.

'This
 follows a decision by the Prime Minister, a few months ago, that the 
Cabinet Secretary should lead a review into what further efficiencies 
could be made at the MoD without affecting frontline capability,' the 
source added.

Downing Street today rejected the idea of the wholesale sell-off of the courts service.

One money-saving option being drawn 
up for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling would involve the privatisation 
of courts in England and Wales.

Court
 buildings and staff would be transferred into the private sector, with 
the potential to save £1billion-a-year, The Times reported.

But David Cameron's officials spokesman insisted the focus was finding savings was on cutting 'back office' costs.

'There aren't proposals for the wholesale privatisation of the courts service,' he added.

'We have been very clear that any future changes must maintain the provision of justice as a core responsibility of the state.'

'That piece of work is expected to finish soon. Once this review is complete, MoD will be in a position to make a Spending Review submission to the Treasury.'

The Ministry of Justice, which has a 
budget of £6.8billion for 2014-15, is the biggest to agree cuts of 10 
per cent for the following year.

But Mr Osborne insisted the 10 per cent savings announced today did not include courts privatisation.

He told the BBC's Today programme: ‘These plans do not involve the privatisation of the criminal justice system.

‘They
 do propose things like making sure we use much less paper. I discovered
 as part of this process the Crown Prosecution Service prints one 
million pieces of paper every day. In an age of the internet and emails,
 that surely isn't necessary.

‘But
 we are also making reforms to youth justice to make sure we can hold 
youngsters in detention without the very substantial costs at the 
moment.’

Paul Johnson, director of the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, warned more cuts lie ahead for Mr Osborne.

‘The bad news for him and, actually, for whoever wins the next election is he’s got a whole bunch of additional spending cuts pencilled in for the years after 2015-16 which is the only year that this Spending Review is looking at.

‘It’s looking at it now because departments are going to need some sense of how much they’re going to have to spend in 2015 and, of course, that financial year starts just before the next election.’

He warned that unprotected departments like the Home Office and Defra will have been hit by cuts of around 30 per cent over six years while areas like health and pensions have survived unscathed.

Labour's shadow financial secretary Chris Leslie said: 'This is a spending review David Cameron and George Osborne never wanted or expected to happen.

'They said their plan would balance the books by the next election, but their failure on growth and jobs means the deficit is now set to be over £90 billion in 2015. That's why the Chancellor is now asking for even more spending cuts, with most big departments yet to reach agreement.'
