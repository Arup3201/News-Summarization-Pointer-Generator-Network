A University professor who claimed he was fired after giving Oscar nominated actor James Franco a poor grade is suing the star for damages.

Jose Angel Santana alleges he was sacked for giving the '127 Hours' star a D after he failed to attend almost all of his classes at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.

The former professor, who has already taken legal action against the university, is reported to have criticised Mr Franco for making 'disparaging and inaccurate public statements,' about him.

Mr Franco was enrolled in a fine arts degree course and was scheduled to attend a film directing course.

Mr Santana, 58, 
claims he was sacked after giving Mr Franco a poor grade for only 
attending two out of his 14 classes.

He said other professors gave Mr Franco high grades and the university wanted high profile celebrities on their courses.

He accused the university of doing 'everything in its power to curry favour with James Franco.'

Mr Santana has since labelled the actor a 'bully' who uses his celebrity status to punish anyone who doesn’t do his bidding,' the New York Post reports.

Mr Santana is now seeking damages in Manhattan Supreme Court against Mr Franco, who played a rock climber who amputated his own arm in the blockbuster film 127 Hours.

Mr Santana, who was sacked in September 2011, said he 'didn’t deserve to be on the receiving end of those falsehoods,' the Post reports.

'I was outraged that someone with his attendance record at NYU had the audacity to make those statements.'

Mr Franco had told reporters that he 'didn’t feel like I needed to waste my time with a bad teacher', according the Post.

He reportedly claimed the university would not have sacked Mr Santana just for giving him a 'D' grade.

Mr Franco reportedly told several media outlets in April that Mr Santana 'wasn’t fired, he was asked not to come back after three years because they didn’t think he was a good teacher.'Mr Santana claims the actor defamed him despite having access to teaching records which showed he had received 'overwhelmingly positive' evaluations from students.

Mr Franco was later hired by the university as a lecturer on how to adapt poetry into short films.

Earlier this year a student at the 
university posted a photo of Mr Franco fast asleep during a lecture at 
Columbia University. He was also reported to have been spotted asleep in
 the school library.

Mr Santana said Mr Franco joined his class 'Directing the Actor II,' last year.

He was the only professor to give Mr Franco a poor grade but denied he had a problem with the actor.

Mr Franco has directed 13 short films and documentaries with his most recent, called 'The Broken Tower,' being described as 'quite tedious' by Variety magazine.

  James Franco has shown a keen interest in advancing his education, even as he continues to work as an actor and director.
