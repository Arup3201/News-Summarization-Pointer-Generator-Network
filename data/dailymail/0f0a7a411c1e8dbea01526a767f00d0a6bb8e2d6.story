Parents are increasingly using access to computers as a way of controlling youngsters’ behaviour, researchers have found.

The Childwise survey, which has been tracking family life in the UK since the 1990s, shows a huge increase in the number of tablet computers used by children.

It shows that young people now spend even more time online than they spend watching television.

In its 21st annual survey, Childwise also found the use of tablet computers is overtaking laptops among young children.

And it suggests iPads, Kindles and smartphones have become important bargaining chips in family negotiations.

The researchers said: ‘Parents like tablets because they are controllable - a tablet can be given or taken away to reflect good or bad behaviour, in a way that is not possible with a conventional television set or computer.

‘Apps can be purchased as rewards, and, with the growing use of tablets in primary schools, there are strong perceived educational advantages.’

However, research director Simon Leggett said tablet computers are particularly likely to be seen as the young person's personal possession, making the arguments about restrictions even more difficult.

Cathy Ranson, editor of the Netmums parenting website, said the survey showed banning screen time was ‘the modern version of grounding’.

She told BBC News that Netmums users had found many parents using limits on computers as a punishment or reward, replacing ‘traditional treats’.

But she warned that too much emphasis on access to screen time could prioritise computers ‘to the exclusion of real family life’.

The Childwise annual survey, based on a representative sample of more than 2,000 children across the UK, aged 5 to 16, shows that two of the most popular destinations are YouTube and the online game Minecraft.

They spend on average more time each night online than they spend in the entire week on sports activities outside school.

The study shows that among the youngest group, five to seven year olds, one in three have their own tablet computer, with two in five going online every day for an average of more than an hour.

Among older children, in the 13 to 16 year old group, internet use is even more widespread, averaging two and a half hours a day, with YouTube the most widely used website.

Smartphones are owned by nine of out of 10 of these teenagers, who use them for accessing the internet and using services like Snapchat with their friends.
