Found dead: Kayla Campbell, 16, told her parents that she would be back in a few hours when she left their Mint Hill home on Sunday afternoon

The body of a missing North Carolina teenager was found in a pond a quarter mile away from her home nearly four days after she disappeared.

Kayla Campbell, 16, told her parents that she would be back in a few hours when she left their Mint Hill home on Sunday afternoon, and when she never returned, her father feared that she had been abducted by someone she met online.

'This morning we must release news we had hoped would not become true in this case,' police said in a statement following the discovery of their body after draining the lake overnight.

The circumstances surrounding her death are still being investigated and the cause was not immediately clear.

Her father Robert Campbell previously told ABCNews.com: 'We were just dealing with the emotions of a teenager, having to do with some online relationships on a Tumblr page. These relationships were not healthy.'

He told the network: 'We called her at 5.20pm and she said she was close-by, but we didn't feel like she was telling the truth... We became concerned when the GPS on her phone showed her being in one area and she told us she was in another. She's not great with directions.'

She has battled with depression in the past, but her brother Josh told WBTV: 'Kayla was getting better. She was working with professionals who were getting her the helps she needs and she was getting better.'

Search: Dive teams searched the lake where Kayla's bicycle, helmet and cell phone were found

Search: Dive teams were called in twice to look for Kayla, and she was found on the second search

On her Tumblr page, Kayla had written of attempting to commit suicide on several occasions.

An initial search of the pond earlier in the investigation had proved fruitless, but on Wednesday night the Mint Hill police spent hours draining the pond, with neighbors occasionally stopping by to check the progress. Just after midnight, the police asked all neighbors and press to leave the scene since they found the teenager's lifeless body.

One neighbor told The Charlotte Observer that the deepest points of the pond, located just off Pumpkin Way Drive, vary between 10 and 12 feet.

Fears: Kayla's father said he has grown concerned over 'unhealthy' online relationships his daughter may have had through her Tumblr page

Problems: Kayla reportedly had been battling depression but her brother said she was getting better

The first sign that the pond may play a role in the case was when police discovered her bicycle, helmet, and cell phone nearby two days ago.

Her family said that would regularly go to the area to hang out and take pictures with her friends from Independence High School.

The FBI joined the investigation, though they never officially ruled it an abduction case, always deeming it a missing persons search.

Her brother Josh told WBTV: 'She's a great kid, couldn't ask for a better sister. All we want right now is for her to come home safe and unharmed.'

Vanished: Kayla's father said that he instructed his daughter to get home before dark on Sunday, and when he called her in the evening after she hadn't returned, he grew suspicious

Found: Kayla's bicycle, helmet and cell phone were found near a lake off Pumpkin Way Drive in Mint Hill on Monday

Mr Campbell said that he instructed his daughter to get home before dark on Sunday, and when he called her in the evening after she hadn't returned, he grew suspicious.

He told the network: 'We called her at 5:20pm and she said she was close-by, but we didn't feel like she was telling the truth... We became concerned when the GPS on her phone showed her being in one 
area and she told us she was in another. She's not great with 
directions.'
