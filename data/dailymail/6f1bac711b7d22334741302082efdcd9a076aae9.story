Dominique Strauss-Kahn's long-suffering wife appears to have run out of patience with her husband after another sex claim was made against him.

Anne Sinclair, 63, reportedly told friends she has decided to leave the former IMF chief following a catalogue of sex scandals in recent months.

The shamed French economist was sacked as boss of the fund after accusations he tried to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May.

He returned to France after the charges were dropped, and then escaped more accusations of trying to rape a young writer in Paris eight years ago.

Police are now probing his alleged connection to an underage prostitution racket at hotels in Lille, northern France.

During the investigation, it has been claimed that a corrupt French police officer regularly flew Â£500-a-night prostitutes to the U.S. for Strauss-Kahn.

It is also claimed he took a prostitute to his office at the International Monetary Fund headquarters in Washington and had sex with the Belgian hooker named Jade at a hotel in the U.S. capital.

He is then said to have invited the 29-year-old call girl to his managing director's office at the institution where he managed the stability of the world's finances.

Until now, Mrs Sinclair has stood by her man in the face of the damaging series of allegations.

But reports in France suggest Mrs Sinclair has now decided to leave him.

Quoting unnamed 'friends', Le Figaro said she was demanding he pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars she spent on his defence in New York.

The newspaper said Mrs Sinclair, 63, was tired of the endless 'pathetic' disclosures about the man once tipped as the next President.

Friends said Strauss-Kahn has plunged into a spiral of depression over the tide of allegations against him.

One told the Journal du Dimanche: 'Now he sits alone at home, biting his fingernails until they bleed.'

And another told French daily le Figaro: 'He is a shadow of his former self. In the last few days he has said that he needs to seek treatment. He admitted he was ill.'

Allegations: French journalist and writer Tristane Banon accused Strauss-Kahn of a sex attack

French daily Liberation last week published text messages allegedly sent in 2009 between Strauss-Kahn and businessman Fabrice Paszkowski, who is also linked to the vice network.

One message sent by Strauss-Kahn to Paszkowski is said to read: 'I'm taking a little thing to the clubs in Vienna on Thursday, May 14. Does that mean you'll be bringing a girl?' Another asked: 'Can you come to a great swingers' club in Madrid with me (and a bit of stuff)?'

And a third one apparently discussed plans for a sex party in the Belgian town of Ghent, know as Gand in French.

It read: 'OK. Understood. For Gand, you have to tell me what's going on. Is it a club or a private party?'

A senior French legal source later said Strauss-Kahn's texts could be viewed by police as encouraging the vice ring bosses to supply girls for sex.

The source warned: 'This repeated demand for prostitutes could constitute the encouragement of pimping.

'DSK may then not be interviewed by police as a witness but he risks in the worst case scenario being being held in custody.'

Detectives have so far said there is no suggestion Strauss-Kahn had sex with underage girls or committed any offence by sleeping with prostitutes - which is legal in France if the girls are over 18.

Mr Strauss-Kahn has branded the claims he had orgies as 'dangerous and malicious insinuations' and insisted he will be able to clear his name.'
