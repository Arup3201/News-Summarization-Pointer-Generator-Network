Baby George has been likened to Elvis with his quiff

When most families show off their newborns for the first time many draw similarities with their mother's nose or eyes. 

But when George Georgious was born there was only one comparison - Elvis. 

The ten week old child was born with a full head of black hair which has formed into a natural quiff and sideburns. 

The youngster's hair style has opposed any attempts to brush his style flat and has retained his quiff. 

His parents Maria and Chris Georgious hope to nurture their son's musical links and have bought an Elvis CDs for his nursery.

Mrs Georgious, 29, said: 'When he was born he had lots of hair - and I mean lots.

It was already a little quiff which was about three centimetres high.

'I took his little brush into hospital and as soon as I saw his hair I thought 'oh my god, he's got a little quiff. We've got the next Elvis'.

'It is growing so quickly and it is already two inches high.

'I've compared him to pictures of Elvis and it is the same mop of hair, with the quiff on the top and flat at the back and sides.

'What's even better is it does it all on its own. I don't have to do anything to it.'

The couple, from Palmers Green in London are both Greek and suspected their first born might have long locks when he arrived on August 11.

But former-hairdresser Mrs Georgious puts her son's hair down to lots of Mars bars and and digestive problems she had during pregnancy.

She suffered with ulcer colitis - a form of irritable bowel syndrome - when she fell pregnant, and doctors even suggested she terminate her pregnancy.

Baby George is now 10 weeks old and people often comment on how similar the youngster looks to Elvis

The couple hope Baby George will be inspired by his Elvis hairstyle and have bought an Elvis CD for the nursery 

But she persisted and kept up her energy with a Mars bar a day.

She added: 'I read that digestive problems like indigestion can result in children having more hair so it might be that.

George's parents suspected their Greek heritage would leave their son to be born with a full head of hair 

People regularly stop baby George's parents to remark on how his hair makes him look like the music icon

Maria Georgious continued with her pregnancy despite doctors advising her she should terminate it

Mrs Georgiou said she played a lot of music while she was pregnant, but Whitney Houston rather than Elvis 

'But I also had a Mars bar every day and each time George would give a little kick, so maybe it was that.

'I did listen to a lot of music when I was pregnant, mostly Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and Mariah Carey.

'No Elvis Presley, but we are certainly going to get him CDs now - I'd love if he was a musical baby.'
