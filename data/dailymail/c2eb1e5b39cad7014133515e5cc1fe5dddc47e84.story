Friends have paid tribute to John Robins, after he tragically died in a surfing accident off the coast of Western Australia on Wednesday.

Mr Robins, a builder and active surf lifesaving club member from Avoca in NSW's Central Coast, was at Surfer's Point in Prevelly near the Margaret River when either the nose or fin of his board is said to have damaged the main artery in one of his legs causing massive blood loss.

The 51-year-old has been described as a 'top bloke' who died 'doing something he loved', Perth Now reports.

Brett Beswick, a fellow Avoca Beach Surf Club member said Mr Robins death is a tragedy.  

'He volunteered a lot of time for Surf Life Saving. He was a really keen surfer, loved big waves, which is probably why he was at Margaret.

'We used to surf together a lot, pushed each other on to more gnarly waves,' Mr Beswick said. 

Last year the father-of-two celebrated his 50th in Hawaii, where he fulfilled his dream by surfing 15-foot waves at Pipeline. 

'If he was going to go out anyway he went out doing something he loved. I’m glad it wasn’t a shark attack.

'When I first heard about it I thought it was a shark but to hear he bled out while help was waiting to arrive is tragic.'

At the time of the incident, Mr Beswick said he just about to call  Mr Robins when he heard the news.

'When it’s one of your own it’s a kick in the guts. A lot of people are just walking around in shock, they couldn’t believe it.'

Now, the community of Avoca are mourning the loss of their beloved builder who was 'always one of the guys you could count on'. 

In 2012, Mr Robins assisted in the rescue of a woman who was swept off rocks at Avoca Beach.

Following Wednesday's tragic accident, Surfers Point was completely empty, a part from a surfer who placed a wreath in the ocean to honour Mr Robins.

Mr Robins was on holidays in WA with his father, wife, and children.

The passionate surfer was dragged ashore by fellow surfers The Daily Telegraph reported, and others on the beach performed CPR on the man for nearly half an hour.

One witness said Mr Robins elderly father was watching on from the carpark when the grisly scene unfolded.

'You just wouldn't believe it because the swell was 2m, the winds were only light, and Surfers Point is always powerful but it wasn't as powerful as it gets,' Surfer Darrly Naidu, 27, told The Daily Telegraph, speaking of the horrible circumstances in which the man died.

He also told of how two men brought the 51-year-old to shore after they saw him wipe-out, and found him with blood pooling around him in the water.

Another witness who spoke to the website said the man was losing a lot of blood from what could have been his femoral artery - which is the main supply of blood to the lower half of the body.

St Johns Ambulance paramedics arrived at the scene just after 11am, after reports the man had been injured. 

Mr Robins was rushed to Margaret River Hospital by emergency services according to theABC, but died a short time later.

West Australian Police media told Daily Mail Australia a report is being prepared for the coroner.
