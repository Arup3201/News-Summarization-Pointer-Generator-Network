A pregnant woman has safely given birth in hospital after a horror crash in New York last night that claimed the life of her 10-year-old daughter.

Sara Friedman, 33, and her little girl Blima were crossing the street in Borough Park, Brooklyn, about 9.15pm when they were both struck down by a grey Honda minivan traveling north on 8th Avenue and 60th Street.

Witnesses at the scene say the mother was screaming for her daughter after being pinned underneath the vehicle, but remained conscious throughout.

The male driver, identified as 22-year-old  Bilal Ghumman, had reportedly taken the car from his job as a valet parking attendant so that he could run an errand.

Emergency crews were able to free Friedman from underneath the car, according to The Yeshiva World.

The mother was rushed to Lutheran Medical Center and her daughter was transported to Maimonides Medical Center.

While the mother's condition was said to be serious but stable, her daughter Blima was pronounced dead from severe trauma.

Doctors took Friedman, who was nine months pregnant, straight into delivery.

She gave birth to a baby girl and both were in a satisfactory condition on Wednesday.

Ghumman was taken into custody on an outstanding marijuana warrant.

The New York Daily News reported that he passed a breathalyzer at the scene.

However, he was reportedly working as a valet  at the time of the crash and was arrested for unauthorized use of a vehicle.

He told police he had taken the car to buy cigarettes and a drink. 

On his Facebook page, Ghumman lists his job as a Rite Aid cashier.  

Investigation: Police have seized security footage from this store to determine whether to press charges

Closed: 60th Avenue was shut off on Tuesday night as police investigated the scene

Police will now determine whether Ghumman will charged over the crash.

They have seized surveillance footage from a nearby 99 cent store.

Footage taken at the scene showed a shoe and some other belongings strewn across the road.

Witness Angel Santos told CBS New York the scene was upsetting 

'When I rounded the corner I saw the lady on the ground, the kid by her and she was holding her stomach,' he said.

'A guy was pacing — the guy from the car pacing. 

'He wasn’t saying anything. He was just like, mad worried; he was just in total shock.'

Sadly this is not the first time the family have been hit by tragedy.

In 2009, another daughter of Sara and Yakov Friedman was critically injured in a house fire.

The three-year-old girl suffered third degree burns following the fire in the home at 47th Street in Borough Park.

The tot was able to survive the injuries and recovered.
