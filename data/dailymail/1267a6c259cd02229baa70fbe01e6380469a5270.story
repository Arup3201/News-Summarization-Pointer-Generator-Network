Anger: Deborah Parrott is unable to get her dog back because a council near her home in Norwich, Norfolk, had already rehomed him when she got in touch

When mother-of-five Deborah Parrott was told her lost dog had been sent to a council kennels she thought she would swiftly be reunited with her lost pet.

But the local authority said her beloved six-year-old German Shepherd and Rottweiler cross had been rehomed with a new family so she couldn't have him back.

Although only six weeks had passed since Rocko slipped out of Ms Parrot's garden, officials refused to even contact the new owner on her behalf to see if a deal could be done.

The pet, which had been with the family since it was a puppy, had not been microchipped.

Rocko vanished from the family's garden in Norwich, Norfolk, on March 14 and Ms Parrot's son Lee, 16, contacted Norwich City Council.

Over the following six weeks the family searched the streets around her home for any sign of her dog.

She had almost given up hope when the girlfriend of her oldest son Dillon, 21, put an advert on Gumtree along with a photograph of Rocko to ask if anyone had found her pet.

Ms Parrott was delighted to hear a few days later from a woman who recognised the picture and phoned to say that she had found the dog on March 18 on a street in Norwich.

She had taken the dog to the Broadland District Council officers who put him in kennels and re-homed him seven days later.

A council official told Ms Parrot that they could not reveal the name of the new owner or the private kennels where he was looked after on behalf of the council.

She said: 'All I wanted was to speak to the person who had been given Rocko so I could tell them that he was my much-loved pet and I was desperate to get him home.

'I am sure that the new owner would be more than happy to give Rocko back to me - but I have no way of knowing who they are unless they hear about me and make contact.

'When I explained all this to the bloke from the council, he just told me, "It's not your dog any more". I replied, "Yes it is my dog - I just want him back".

Owner's fury: Broadland District Council said ownership of the dog had already passed so there was nothing they could do

'I said, "Can I speak to the people who have got him", and he said, "We can't do that".

'I just couldn't understand his attitude. I guess it was just because of their confidentiality rules. But there is nothing to stop them getting hold of the person who has Rocko and asking them to call me.'

Ms Parrott said she had initially only reported Rocko was missing to Norwich City Council as it is her local authority.

Three weeks later, she contacted neighbouring councils in case her pet had been found in their areas.

When she first made contact with Broadland District Council, officials failed to tell her that Rocko had already been handed in and re-homed.

Ms Parrott said: 'The problem is a lack of communication. I feel I have been treated in a disgusting way.

'It would have been much easier if Rocko had been microchipped, but I did not really see the need of it before now because he had never gone off before.

'I have owned Rocko for six years since he was a puppy. He is such a clever dog and I miss him every day. The house just isn't the same without him.

'I'm not angry with the new owners, I just want them to know the whole situation so we can get something sorted so that Rocko can come home.'

John Fisher, the Broadland District Council portfolio holder for environmental excellence, said: 'If this dog had a tag and/or chip, it could have been identified straight away by either the person who found it or Pets at Home and returned to its owner.

'We are very sorry to hear that this resident could not be reunited with her dog, and would urge all owners to bear in mind the heartache and expense which can be saved by a simple chip or tag for your dog's collar.'

A council spokesman added: 'If anyone calls Broadland District Council reporting a lost dog, we always recommend they call all local councils in the area.'
