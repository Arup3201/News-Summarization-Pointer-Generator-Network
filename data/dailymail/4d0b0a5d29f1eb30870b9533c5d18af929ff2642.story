The father of Hannah Smith who killed herself after being bullied online has asked friends and relatives of the tragic teenager to wear onesies to her funeral.

David Smith has banned traditional black from this Friday's service in favour of the all-in-one fashion garment in a bid to make the event a celebration of his beloved daughter's life.

According to The Sun, the 45-year-old said: 'I have asked all her friends to wear onesies because Hannah virtually lived in hers.

'I know she would be up there smiling if all her friends turned up at the church wearing their onesies.

'She would want us to be happy. No one is allowed to wear black. I want it to be a celebration of Hannah's life.'

Mr Smith, a lorry driver, will be carrying Hannah into the St Mary's Church in the town of Lutterworth where she lived in a specially made lightweight casket.

Tragic: The 14-year-old was found hanged in her bedroom by her sister earlier this month. Hannah had been the victim of online bullying

News website thisisleicestershire quoted Mr Smith as saying: 'I have lost count of how many times I carried her to bed after she fell asleep downstairs, so I know I can do it.

'This will be me, her dad. carrying her as she goes to sleep forever.'

Hundreds of mourners are expected to attend Hannah's funeral.

Her sister Jo, 16, will light a single candle and tributes will be paid by her family and friends.

The Lutterworth High School pupil was found hanged in her bedroom by Jo earlier this month.

Prior to her death, the 14-year-old had been bullied by anonymous trolls on social networking website Ask.fm.

Hannah had used the site to talk about her eczema and the loss of her uncle to cancer.

On Monday, Mr Smith branded bosses of the Latvian-based website 'disgusting' after they claimed Hannah had sent herself the abusive messages.

An independent review, set up in to the social networking site's safety features, is due to report its findings on Friday afternoon, just hours after Hannah's service.
