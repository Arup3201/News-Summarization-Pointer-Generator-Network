The lawyer representing one of four former Vanderbilt University football players charged in a June 2013 campus rape, says his client was 'too drunk to rape' or be held responsible for his actions.

Vanderbilt tight end Brandon Vandenburg, safety Cory Batey, defensive Brandon Banks, and receiver Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie were suspended and indicted in September 2013 for allegedly raping a 21-year-old female student and videotaping the assault.

But now Vandenburg's defense attorney says her client was too drunk to know what he was doing and would not have been able to perform such a sex act, the Tennessean reports.

Nashville prosecutors says the theory is far-fetched and wants to put a stop to the alibi before it goes any further.

A new court filing asks a judge to block a Los Angeles-based psychologist from testifying about Vandenburg's drunkenness on the night police say he took part in the rape of his unconscious 21-year-old girlfriend in his dorm room.

The psychologist's report suggests that the idea Vandenburg was so drunk as to be unaware of his surroundings but prosecutors say such an idea is 'purely speculative' and not based on science. 

Although the judge in the case has not ruled on whether to allow the 'evidence' during the forthcoming trial, it is unlikely that drunkenness would be allowed to serve as an excuse for committing a crime.

'Intoxication is generally not a defense to prosecution of a crime, particularly when the defendant was 'voluntarily' intoxicated,' said David Veile, a Franklin criminal defense attorney and continuing legal education instructor to the Tennessean.

Veile said intoxication wouldn't help Vandenburg clear himself of recklessness, which is one of several factors in prosecuting aggravated rape.

Crime scene: Police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her but his defense lawyer said he was far too drunk to do it

Freed: Brandon Vandenburg was released from jail this in September 2013 k on $350,000 bond

'(Defendants) cannot later claim that they were 'so drunk' that they were unaware of a substantial risk,' he said.

The psychologist's report also provides a new account of what happened when Vandenburg and the woman arrived at Gillette Hall after authorities said they were drinking at The Tin Roof bar.

According to CCTV video, a 'very intoxicated' Vandenburg drove the woman's black Mercedes through an intersection without stopping and parked near a police vehicle.

Vandenburg bumped the woman's head on the car door before seeking help from three other men to take her inside. 

He also hit his own head on an elevator and vomited in a bathroom, 'intoxicated to the extent that he could not have possessed the required culpable mental state to form intent to be held criminally responsible for the actions of the others that were in his room,' wrote psychologist Stefanie Stolinsky.

The defense also wants to prevent the victim from testifying at trial.

During the attack, Vandenburg sent a picture to another player, Chris Boyd, which he deleted, prosecutors have said. 

Boyd received an 11-month, 29-day suspended sentence after pleading guilty to criminal attempt to commit accessory after the fact. Prosecutors say he attempted to cover up the rape.

Afterward, Boyd sent a text to Vandenburg saying he and the other players who had been there should delete the photos and videos they had taken. Boyd said he was looking out for their interests 

According to an account given at a different hearing, Deputy Attorney General Tom Thurman said Vandenburg took an unconscious fellow student to his dormitory in the early morning of June 23, 2013.

He was joined by three other dismissed players — Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian "Tip" McKenzie. The student was sexually assaulted "by different individuals," Thurman had said.

All four are charged with several counts of rape and have pleaded not guilty. They are free on bond. Banks and McKenzie face separate trials. 

The case has become cantankerous with the defense and prosecution trading allegations of misconduct against one another. 

The trial begins for Vandenburg and Batey on November 3rd. 

Two other defendants, Brandon Banks and Jaborian Mckenzie, have their own separate their trials to come.
