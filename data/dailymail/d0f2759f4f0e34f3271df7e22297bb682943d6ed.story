Some exasperated parents find their children don't need any excuse to get dirty.

But when it's Michigan's annual Mud Day, the rulebook is thrown out and trying to get as muddy as possible is only agenda. 

Thousands of children and teenagers donned their swimming costumers and old T-shirts to wallow in the brown sludge at Hines Park in Westland.

Muddy madness: Thousands of children and teenagers donned their swimming costumes and old T-shirts to wallow in glorious mud at Hines Park in Westland

To create the muddy pit firefighters poured 100,000 litres of water on top of 200 tonnes of dirt.

The result meant children spent hours diving, sliding and throwing sludge in the gigantic mud bath.

The fun included limbo contests and 
wheelbarrow races as well as the crowning of a mud king and queen – the 
winners were the messiest children.

Wheel barrow races were no doubt more difficult in the squelch than on dry land and when they became tired from the exertion of moving through the sludge, many just wallowed, glad to lie down in the cool brown water.

Organiser Beverly Watts said: ‘Kids always have to stay clean at home. This is one day where they can get dirty.’

Big order: Firefighters poured 20,000 gallons of water onto 200 tons of topsoil to make the mudpit

Having a ball: Some people were shocked about the temperatrue of the mud, but soon go began to enjoy the mud fest

Fun times: The delighted youngsters made delicious mud pies and there were also organised games to keep them occupied

And it wasn't just the children having fun - the lure of the brown sludge was too 
much for some parents and they also got stuck into getting muddy, 
although they had to join the youngsters at the end to be hosed down by a firetruck.

Candi Bostain was one of the adult participants who took part.

She said: ‘There’s nothing like the mud squishing between your toes. Now I know what pigs feel like.’

Mud Day 2012 also doubled up as a training exercise for Western Wayne Hazardous Materials 
Response Team, which includes firefighters from Farmington Hills and 22 
other metro Detroit departments.

Farmington Hills Fire Lt. Mike Kish. 
told Farmington Hills Patch that no other hazmat team in the country does
a live decontamination exercise.

'We set the whole thing up in about 12 minutes,' he said.

Children
moved through a line of firefighters who hosed the mud off them, 
although some younger children were held up to hosed down by their 
parents.

'In real life, there would be soap and water,' Mr Kish added.
