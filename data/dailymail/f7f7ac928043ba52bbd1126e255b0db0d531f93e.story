From bouffant hair and tight, white shorts to fast cars and controversial remarks, Jeremy Clarkson has grown from a young boy into an outspoken man in front of our eyes.

The 54-year-old star, who was dramatically dropped from the BBC yesterday after launching an assault on a  producer, started his Top Gear career as a smartly-dressed twenty-something with a background in journalism.

Over the years, he has transformed the motoring show into a worldwide phenomenon and viewers have grown to love his quick-witted comments and sarcastic jibes.

However, the television presenter hasn't endured a career without controversy, and has been at the centre of numerous rows on a range of subjects including allegations of racism. 

Now, as his BBC career finally comes to an end, we take a look in pictures at how the opinionated star's career - and personal life - has developed over the years.

Already at the wheel: On a family holiday, aged nine in 1969, and Jeremy takes the helm. It’s going to be a bumpy voyage - but never a dull one. Jeremy Clarkson has grown from this young boy into an outspoken man - in front of our eyes. The 54-year-old was dramatically dropped from the BBC yesterday after launching an assault on a producer

Rule Britannia: Aged 24, Jeremy’s innate flair for diplomacy comes shining through on a French holiday in 1984 (right). Pictured left: A teensy bit short on style: Many have tried to trace the origins of Jeremy’s fashion sense. It appears footballer Kevin Keegan was an early influence

Big hair, don’t care: Clarkson sporting a bouffant look for an early Top Gear appearance, in a photo believed to have been taken in the 1980s. He has transformed the motoring show into a worldwide phenomenon and viewers have grown to love his quick-witted comments

Revving up: Jeremy’s first Top Gear appearance in 1988. Was he trying to impress his new bosses with the smart blazer and tie? The 54-year-old star started his Top Gear career as a smartly-dressed twenty-something with a background in journalism

Honeymoon period: With the first Mrs Clarkson, Alexandra James, in 1989. It was over in months, but the relationship restarted years later during his second marriage. She broke up with Clarkson for one of his friends and wedding guests

Racy moment: By now married to Frances Cain, whom he married in April 2003, (pictured together right), Jeremy is caught snogging a BBC producer while test-driving a new Honda in 2000. It was said he had to apologise to both of his wives

Life is full of ups and downs. At Blackpool in 2001, Jeremy and his mother ride 'The Big One' rollercoaster for a new series called 'Speed'. The show saw Clarkson go around the world, looked into the art of travelling very fast and why people enjoy travelling at such great speed

Flying high: Last flight of Concorde in 2003. Finding his sworn enemy, Piers Morgan, in the seat behind, Jeremy tips champagne into his lap. Yesterday, after his sacking was announced, Piers Morgan tweeted 'If he'd stuck to just punching me, he'd have been fine. #Clarkson'

Egg on his face: Not everyone at Oxford Brookes University thought Jeremy should get an honorary degree  in 2005. Road protester Rebecca Lush gave him a custard pie. ‘Good shot!’ he told her. Clarkson was nominated by the School of Technology for his championing of high standards in engineering, but green campaigners attacked the move, saying he had a poor stance on the environment

Ice and a slice: He enjoys a G&T at the wheel, driving to the North Pole in 2007 — and is, inevitably, censured by bosses for ‘misuse of alcohol’. The incident was one of a string of controversies to hit the outspoken presenter during his long career 

The Banned Waggon: Jeremy flouts the smoking ban — on air — to test drive a Porsche pipe. Clarkson was then shown 'eating' the pipe's bowl, before running from the stage having burned his tongue. The Ash anti-smoking lobby demand an apology

Baywatch bulge: In Barbados in 2008, entries for the annual Michael Winner lookalike competition are limbering up at the Sandy Lane Hotel

Road rage: Lorry drivers protest after Jeremy cracks a joke which appeared to reference Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and 'Suffolk Strangler' Steve Wright. He said: 'What matters to lorry drivers? Murdering prostitutes? Fuel economy?' he says. 'This is a hard job and I'm not just saying this to win favour with lorry drivers... change gear, change gear.... check your mirrors... murder a prostitute...'

Not exactly Poldark: The costume department clearly enjoyed themselves with this Top Gear episode on the north Cornish coast

Worse for wear: He insists he’s not leaving the family home to move into a bachelor pad in London, after photos appeared of a lively night out with a former Miss World in 2011. The pictures showed him embracing Linda Petursdottir, with his trademark cigarette between his fingers, before the pair were whisked off in a taxi

On tour: Leaving a Sydney restaurant in 2013 with Phillipa Sage, the events organiser with whom he allegedly had a year-long affair in 2011. Ms Sage has been regularly at Clarkson's side during his recent suspension from the BBC

Burning bridges: The ‘Burma Special’ Top Gear episode in 2014. After allegations of a racial slur involving the word ‘slope’, Ofcom upholds viewers’ complaints — all two of them. Clarkson has been at the centre of numerous rows on a range of subjects during the show's career

Bad verse: When out-takes of an ill-judged ‘eeny-meeny’ gag leak out in which critics claim to hear the ‘n’ word, BBC bosses warn Jeremy he is on borrowed time. Clarkson had previously issued a robust denial of the allegation, telling his 3.2 million Twitter followers: 'I did not use the N-word. Never use it.' But in a video statement posted online later, he begged for forgiveness, saying that he had tried to obscure the word when reciting the rhyme but that his efforts to do so 'weren't quite good enough'

Battle of the River Plate Number Plate: The car which spawned a pitched battle in Argentina and sent Top Gear packing. Argentina will not be crying after yesterday’s news of Clarkson’s BBC exit. Many felt the number plate was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War and Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, met with BBC director of television Danny Cohen to demand a public apology
