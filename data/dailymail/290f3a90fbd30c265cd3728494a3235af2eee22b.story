An Australian radio station has donated £298,000 to the family of a nurse who hanged herself after putting through a prank phone call to Kate Middleton's hospital bedside.

Private medical information about the Duchess of Cambridge was revealed after Jacintha Saldanha, 46, answered a call from DJ Melanie Greig, who was posing as the Queen for a radio show.

Southern Cross Austereo station defended the DJs responsible and made the donation to a trust following an inquest in London yesterday.

A statement said: 'We do not assume, of course, that this donation or any amount of money could relieve the feelings of loss felt by Ms Saldanha's family, but it is our hope that it may help them in the future.

'The production of radio programmes, like television programmes, is a collaborative process.

'Radio announcers are an important part of the process, but they are not the final decision makers. There is no fair or reasonable basis on which blame can be apportioned to any individual, including the presenters of the programme.

'Southern Cross Austereo has always accepted full responsibility for the making of the call and its broadcast.'

The DJs called King Edward VII Hospital in December 2012, posing as the Queen and Prince Charles

Ms Greig called King Edward VII Hospital in December 2012 along with fellow radio host Michael Christian, who was posing as Prince Charles.

The coroner ruled that the hoax had been 'pressing upon' Mrs Saldanha's mind when she committed suicide three days later.

The Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for severe morning sickness at the hospital when the call was made.

Ms Greig, 32, broke down in court yesterday, saying she had 'waited so long to say sorry'.

Addressing the 46-year-old mother-of-two's family after the inquest, Ms Greig sobbed as she told them and the packed courtroom: 'I really just wanted to say I am truly sorry, I've wanted to say that for so long.

'This tragedy will always stay with me and serve as a constant reminder.

'To the second nurse involved, I am so deeply sorry for what you have had to endure. I pray you have found the strength to live on as best you can.

'I was always concerned about the wellbeing of both nurses and I wish I'd tried harder to stop that prank from being aired.'

She went on to urge hospitals and the media to learn from the incident and make sure it was not repeated.

She added: 'To fellow announcers and DJs, I urge you to speak up if you don't feel comfortable and consider the feeling of others when trying to make a joke.

'The joke should always be on us, the DJs.'
