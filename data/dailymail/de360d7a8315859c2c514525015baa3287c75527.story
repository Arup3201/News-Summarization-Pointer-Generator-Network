Sabre Norris may be the daughter of three-time Commonwealth Games gold medal-winning swimmer Justin Norris, but she's made a name for herself already.

The nine-year-old recently gained fame over the internet when a video of her accomplishing her first 540 trick on a half-pipe went viral.

It took the young skateboarder 75 attempts at the intense trick before she successfully launched off the ramp before spinning her board one-and-a-half turns and landing it back on the ramp.

Sabre Norris from Newcastle in New South Wales found fame on the internet when a video of her doing her first 540 skateboarding trick went viral

It took Sabre 75 attempts before she successfully launched off the ramp before spinning her board one-and-a-half turns and landing it back on the ramp

The video shows the young girl painstakingly attempting the trick over and over again, but falling to her knees each time.

Finally managing to keep from tripping off her board, Sabre was absolutely ecstatic at her achievement once her success dawned on her.

Upon publishing her video via  The Berrics, Sabre, who is from Newcastle in New South Wales, told the skateboarding website that she doesn't actually know how to ride a bicycle.

'My skating all started because I wasn't allowed to get a bike because we don't have a garage. So my mum bought us skateboards instead,' she said.

'I started from rolling down my dad's business car park. I've been skating for about 3 years. My favorite trick is a 540. I watched Lyn-Z Adams Hawkins do it on the internet, and I just had to do it.

The nine-year-old girl was ecstatic, screaming with joy when she finally achieved the incredibly difficult trick

'That was my 75th attempt of the day. Every time I tried one and didn't land it I put a rock on the table. It ended up being my 75th rock. I was frothing. I did some 720s too. Not proper. I called it 540 to revert to splat. I didn't cry though. My goal is to do 100 of them before this Saturday. I'm up to 75.

'I still can't ride a bike, but I can do a 540.'

The talented young girl also won first place in the girl's competition of the Australian Bowl-riding Championships in February of this year.

But that's only the beginning of a list of goals the ambitious nine-year-old plans to achieve.

Her surfboarding team was placed third team at the Australian Boardriders Battle in January, with Sabre holding her fingers crossed for a spot on the World Championship Tour one day.

Inspired by her Olympic bronze medal-winning father, swimmer Justin Norris, Sabre said she dreams of winning an Olympic gold medal in skateboarding which might be included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics

She also told the Newcastle Herald that she dreams of winning an Olympic gold medal in skateboarding which might be included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

As a bronze medal winner for the 200-metre butterfly at the Sydney Olympic Games, her father is clearly an inspiration for the goal.

Sabre is now trying to master her next trick, a 540 McTwist, which involves a front flip combined with a 540-degree rotation.
