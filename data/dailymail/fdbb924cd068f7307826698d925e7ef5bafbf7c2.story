It may have been read by teenagers for more than 70 years, but Archie Comics is proving it is still as current as ever.

Their only openly gay character Kevin Keller has his first kiss in a forthcoming issue. 

The Riverdale teen finds his life turned upside down after locking lips with his boyfriend, Devon, in Pop Tate's diner, drawing the ire of at least one disapproving Riverdale mom.

Moving forward: Openly-gay character Kevin Keller, right, kissing his boyfriend Devon. The issue will go on sale on August 7

The woman 'gets very offended and kind of pitches a bit of a fit,' said Dan Parent, who writes and draws the issue, 'Kevin Keller' No. 10 that is released August 7.

'Kevin is kind of used to that, but Veronica records the whole thing and of course uploads it to the Riverdale equivalent of YouTube and that starts a bit of a debate,' said Parent.

Life imitating art: Writer Dan Parent said he wrote the story after efforts to remove a comic magazine showing Keller getting married drew at complaints

For Archie Comics it's a bit of art imitating life.

Parent said he wrote the story after efforts to remove a comic magazine showing Keller getting married drew at complaints. 

One Million Moms, a project of The 
American Family Association, asked Toys R Us not to display 'Life With 
Archie' No. 16 near its checkout aisles.

Toys R Us did not, and the 
issue went on to sell out its print run.

Parent called the new story a 'playful poke' at the protest.

Keller debuted in 'Veronica' No. 202 in September 2010. It resulted in Archie Comics' first-ever second printing.

It was quickly followed by a four-issue miniseries and the current monthly title.

Publisher
and co-CEO Jon Goldwater said the fact that any kiss is being shown in 
the pages of an Archie Comics book is a step in and of itself.

'There
aren't that many on-panel kisses in the pages of Archie, but you often 
see the lipstick on Archie's face afterward,' he said.

Goldwater said Keller's character has let the company weave in contemporary issues to its imaginary world.

'We certainly pride ourselves on being contemporary, but that's not the reason why we're showing  `The
Kiss.'

Just like when Kevin first told Jughead he was gay, it was in 
the natural course of conversation,' said Goldwater. 'We are creating 
this in the same way. It's just part of the story.'
