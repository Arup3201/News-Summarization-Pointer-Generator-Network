A married mother wants to teach a lesson to the couple who sent an explicit porn video and racy pictures to her using her own stolen phone.

Victoria Brodsky, 39, who works in social services, told MailOnline today that she initially felt sorry for the couple who appear to have unwittingly sent the steamy material via the phone to her file-saving service Dropbox - but now feels they need to learn that stealing has consequences.

Mrs Brodsky was at a street fair last August 25 with two friends when her Samsung Galaxy S3 was pick-pocketed in Brighton Beach, New York.

A Brooklyn mother wants the couple who posted dozens of naked selfies on her stolen phone that 'stealing is wrong'

The couple posted dozens of images in various states of undress and a homemade sex tape which is took explicit to reveal

Mrs Brodsky told MailOnline from Brooklyn on Thursday: 'I was moving through the crowd and then when I went to call my husband, the phone and my wallet were gone.'

The mother, who has a daughter, four, and 18-month-old son, immediately contacted police to report the crime and canceled her credit cards.

However because Mrs Brodsky had not seen anyone actually stick their hand in her bag to take the belongings, police listed the phone as 'lost' and not stolen.

A few days later, Mrs Brodsky began to receive images of a couple she did not recognize in Dropbox - a free service that lets users save pictures automatically from a phone which is synced to their computer.

The 39-year-old said that she did not recognize the couple who came to have possession of her phone.

Mrs Brodsky said: 'I evaluated the pictures but I didn't recognize the couple. At first, it's not bad. It's him posting pictures of her smiling and some of him, posing for the camera.

'I felt sorry for them. They looked poor, they were living in a place with a mattress on the floor and I thought ''okay, I get why you stole it.'''

Victoria Brodsky had a homemade sex tape and graphic photos sent to her home computer by an unknown couple after her phone was stolen

A few days later, Mrs Brodsky was sickened to find that the couple had posted sexually charged, naked photos of themselves to her Dropbox account along with a homemade sex tape which is too graphic to be published.

It appears that the couple were unaware that the photos were being sent to Mrs Brodsky's home computer and her iPad.

She said: 'When they posted the pictures and video of them naked and having sex, I thought, ''you know, they are enjoying the whole process and don't feel bad about it at all.'''

Mrs Brodsky said that the Samsung does have an alert when an image is sent to Dropbox but that if you don't known how to use the phone fully, you might be unaware it was happening.

The photos and video appeared in the space of a couple of days before Mrs Brodsky got a new phone and transferred her number, causing the stolen phone to be blocked.

The mother-of-two had to pay $150 dollars for a new phone and an additional $40 for the protective case.

Mrs Brodsky contacted police to see if they could track down the alleged phone thieves.

However officers said they could not pursue the couple as they did not have proof they stole the phone - and had no way of tracking them.

Social worker Mrs Brodsky, pictured with her husband, said that she wanted to send the message that there was consequences to stealing

Mrs Brodsky said: 'At first I left it alone but then I thought I would love it if they learned a lesson not to steal and be publicly scrutinized for what they did.

She added: 'If you are poor, figure out what to do about it but this is not the answer.'
