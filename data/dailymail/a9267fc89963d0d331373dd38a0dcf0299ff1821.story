Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker jumped to the top of the Republican presidential primary field in early primary states, a set of surveys show.

Dark horse candidate no more, 47-year-old Walker, now in his second term as Wisconsin's head of state, is polling in the double digits in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - the first three states scheduled to hold contests next year.

Likewise, Walker and several other likely GOP competitors have closed the gap with race frontrunner, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Walker is represented consistently by the blue bar in the graph above. Likewise, race frontrunner Jeb Bush is represented by the green bar, while various other candidates - Mike Huckabee, Rand Pau and Lindsey Graham -  are tied to the red bar

Bush, 62, is the only Republican aside from South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham who has verbally committed to exploring a presidential bid. As such, his political action has been the beneficiary of a steady stream of large dollar donations.

But a series of missteps, including the accidental release last week of former constituents' private information such as Social Security numbers along with the planned release of a trove of the former executives communications, generated unfavorable headlines for the moderate Republican.

In Iowa, ex-Arkansas Gov. and Fox News personality Mike Huckabee, now leads with 17 percent of registered Republicans' support, according to an NBC News/Marist survey taken there this month.

Still hot on Huckabee's heels is Bush at 16 percent, Walker now commands 15 percent of Iowans' support. No other GOP politicians tested made it to the 10 percent watermark.

In the Northeast, Bush continues to maintain a three-point lead over his next closest competitor, Walker, winning 18 percent of the potential Republican electorate in New Hampshire to the Wisconsin politicians' 15 percent.

Just behind were Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, 14 percent, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, 13 percent, the NBC News poll, released Sunday, revealed.

South Carolina Republicans are sticking by their favorite son, Graham, a veteran lawmaker and war hawk.

The 59-year-old Senator claimed 17 percent of Republican voters' support in his state to Bush's 15 percent and Walker's 12 percent. 

Huckabee and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, endeared to conservatives after a National Prayer Breakfast speech he gave in 2013, both nosed in at 10 percent.

Jeb Bush is no longer the clear frontrunner in the GOP's 2016 presidential contest. Walker is hot on his heels in every early primary states, and in Iowa, he is now lead by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee

Democrats continue to flock to former First Lady Hillary Clinton in every early state. The former New York lawmaker has polled in the mid to high 60s in across the board in the NBC News/Marist polls. 

Vying for second place were Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden.

Biden was the favorite in Iowa, attracting 12 percent of the state's Democratic voters to Sanders' seven percent, and the former Sen. from Delaware trounced in Sanders in South Carolina. The he earned 20 percent of Democrats' support while Sanders came in at just three percent in the NBC survey.

But in New Hampshire, it is Sanders who currently has the upper hand in the context, polling at 13 percent. That's still 56 percent below Clinton in that state however. Her strongest showing among the three surveys, she has 69 percent of Democrats's support in The Granite State.
