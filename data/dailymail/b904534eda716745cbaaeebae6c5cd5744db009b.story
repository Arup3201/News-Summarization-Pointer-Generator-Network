Footage of an Australian man who features in a chilling video condoning the beheadings of ISIS fighters  will be investigated 'very closely' by the Australian Government.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australia's 'intelligence, police and security' will view the video, which shows combat medic and self-described 'true blue Aussie' Abu Ousama defending ISIS beheadings to protect the 'innocent Muslims of this country.'

Ms Bishop condemned the messages and has vowed to investigate in order to safeguard Australians from 'murderous cults.'

Speaking in a thick Australian accent Abu Ousama says he condones the beheadings by terror group ISIS 

Ousama is living among rebel fighters and working as a medic for Jund al-Aqsa, a group affiliated with ISIS 

Ms Bishop said it was 'unthinkable' that anyone would be defending beheadings for religious or territorial messages, the ABC reported. 

'These are murderous cults and they are using Islam to cover up for their violent behaviour. They are using religion as an excuse for what is simply murder, Ms Bishop said.

Speaking in a thick Australian accent Mr Ousama said he is missing home comforts like Coco Pops and says 'home is home, everybody is going to love their country'. 

He says there is no difference between a missile killing 15 people and one man getting his throat cut 

Australian jihadist Ousama spoke candidly to a British photojournalist about his experience in Syria 

Julie Bishop has vowed to investigate the video

Ousama is living among rebel fighters for Jund al-Aqsa and is one of the 100 Australians who have crossed over into Syria since the conflict began.

Since the airing of the footage Tony Abbott's office has referred the footage to Australian intelligence agencies, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. 

He took part in the interview broadcast on 7News by British photojournalist Tam Hussain who lived with the 1000 strong Islamic battalion group that is independent of ISIS but supports their ideology.

Ousama, who didn't say where he was from in Australia, told 7News: 'You have these beheadings and some people might call them barbaric, some people might have these names for them but what is the difference between a missile that hits into a house which kills 15 kids compared to a man dying getting cut by his throat.'

He says the brutality of ISIS is a necessary part of establishing an Islamic State.

'ISIS have taken this role of protecting the innocent Muslims of this country, of this land.

'So, they have to do what they need to do to make their state.

Tam Hussain spoke to Abu Ousama when he was living in a city north of Hama 

'If they're blackmailing America or anybody saying don't shoot a missile which is going to kill 50 or 60 people for one bloke how can we even say that's equivalent to it being a wrong?' 

When Ousama is not fighting he works as a medic in a local hospital and he wants the Australian public to know that he would not pose a risk if he returned home.

'There is no hatred between me and Australia. Actually home is home, everybody is going to love their country,' he said. 

British photojournalist Tam Hussain spent weeks living and interviewing the Islamic terror group 

Hussain was treated like a member of the group in northern Syria for his time spent with the group 

Ousama says that ISIS have taken on its role to protect 'innocent Muslims' 

ISIS fighters now have strongholds in Iraq and Syria 

Islamic State terrorists have raised the black flag of Jihad in Kobane, Kurdish forces have been trying to resist this for weeks 

 The young Aussie also reveals that there are no home comforts living in Syria and he has to pay 500 Syrian for a box of Coco Pops.   

'Just because you miss home you feel like some Coco Pops,' he told 7News. 

Despite his positive memories about Australia he does not rule out fighting against troops who might invade.

'If they are going to come in with their aeroplanes and shoot missiles and kill innocents etc etc then how can anybody, you're forced to. 

'I hope that Allah accepts the good we've done and blesses us with his reward if the highest paradise. This is the best. What more could you want, you know?

'I'm sad to see Australia taking that step to come into a place it doesn't need to be because it will cause a reaction, it will cause people to hate it,' he told 7News. 

Ousama says the brutal beheading of James Foley was 'necessary' for ISIS to develop the Islamic State 

Despite his views Ousama says he does not hate his home country but is not scared to die in Syria 

Living in Syria means this young Australian is missing home comforts like Coco Pops
