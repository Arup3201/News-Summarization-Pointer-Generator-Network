Joy turned to sadness yesterday after a giant panda gave birth to a stillborn cub at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, grooming the lifeless cub before finally letting it fall to the floor after 17 minutes.

Mei Xiang (may-SHONG), the zoo's 15-year-old female giant panda, gave birth to a healthy pink panda cub Friday night and zookeepers were eagerly awaiting the possible birth of a twin.

As the first pictures of the dead cub’s twin looking vigorous and full of life are revealed, it has emerged that Mei Xiang gave birth a second time last night - but the twin was born motionless and subsequent examinations showed it suffered abnormalities and died in utero.

'There is a chance, a 50 per cent chance,
that another panda will be born, a twin,' Dennis Kelly, the National 
Zoo's director on Friday, said Friday.

They had all but given up hope of a second cub when Mei Xiang gave birth to the motionless panda.

The stillborn cub had abnormalities and 'had never been alive,'  zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson said in a statement.

'It lay motionless and made no sound. Throughout, staff could see it visually and hear the first cub squealing, and Mei never set it down.'

Zookeepers were able to remove the lifeless cub and saw that the cub suffered abnormalities.

The zoo began performing a necropsy on the stillborn cub late Saturday that they hope will tell them why the cub stopped developing and died in utero, she said.

According to NBC's Today, Mei Xiang had been on a 24-hour pregnancy watch since her behavior became increasingly maternal and she began cradling her toys, licking her body and 'nesting.'

The protective mother only allowed zoo staff close enough to examine the first healthy cub this morning.

Brandie Smith, the zoo's curator of mammals compared the 
planned exam to a race car pit stop, a fast and highly choreographed 
checkup before reuniting mom and cub.

The cub's first neonatal exam showed vets it is 'robust, fully formed, 
and is a bright, healthy shade of pink,' tweeted the zoo.

The zoo's account notes that it weighs 137 grams, which is 
about 4.8 ounces and that its heart rate is steady.

Vets were able to hear 
breathing sounds from both lungs and its belly was full, indicating it is nursing.

'All signs are that we have a very healthy, active, vibrant 
cub,' the zoo's account tweeted.

The
check-up will enable vets to determine who exactly is the father of the
cub, since Mei Shang was artificially inseminated with sperm from both 
the Smithsonian Zoo's Tian Tian and Gao Gao, a male giant panda from the
San Diego Zoo.

The cub's paternity and sex won't be known until results come in in a couple of weeks.

The tiny cub was the third pregnancy for Mei Shang, who tragically lost another cub six days after giving birth last year. Its lungs hadn't fully developed and likely weren't sending enough oxygen to its liver.

She gave birth to a healthy cub, a male called Tai Shan, in 2005.

Visitors to the zoo Saturday said they were excited about another panda cub. Melissa Schmechel, of Alexandria, Virginia, said she spent about 30 minutes Friday watching the zoo's online panda cam after it was announced on Facebook and Twitter that Mei Xiang had gone into labor.

She said she and her family had made plans to visit the zoo last year after the birth of Mei Xiang's second cub and were sad when it died.

'Hopefully this will have a better outcome,' she said as her 11-year-old daughter, Laura, hugged a newly purchased stuffed panda.
