Civil servants are getting paid an extra £1,000 a year simply for being able to type, it emerged last night.

The award is one of a string of perks worth £7.5million available annually at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and related quangos.

Others include officials at the Local Government Ombudsman who are paid up to an additional £684 for working from home.

Civil servants can receive more than £1,000 for 'proficient typing' under a raft of extra Whitehall allowances

Perks such as a 'disturbance grant' of £2,325 for staff working away from home on special projects were revealed in a Parliamentary answer to Conservative MP Priti Patel.

Mrs Patel said: 'In this day and age, civil servants should not be getting bonuses in addition to their pay just for doing their job.

'Now is a good time ahead of the comprehensive spending review to say that we have got to be spending our money more wisely.'

Staff at the DCLG who become fire marshals are paid an extra £144, while those who learn first aid get an additional £200.

An extra £3,160 is paid to staff if they agree to be on-call and field calls after 'normal' working hours – an expected and unrewarded part of most private sector jobs.

One quango, the Homes and Communities Agency, hands a bonus of 10 per cent of annual salary to staff who undertake additional duties 'for a significant time in addition to their normal duties'.

IT staff also get an extra 10 per cent for being called out during 'unsocial hours'. At the Housing Ombudsman all staff get £427 extra a year as a personal development allowance.

Meanwhile, the Planning Inspectorate has spent more than £1million since 2011 on allowances and subsidies, including up to £4,000 per staff member to 'retain' officials. An array of bonuses are paid for inspectors – including £3,056  for officials who undertake 'specialist right of way work', normally  carried out by bureaucrats at a higher grade.

Technicians at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, opposite the Houses of Parliament, receive up to £6,500 a year if they have to liaise with clients.

Car allowances worth a total £61,398 were handed out to staff at the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation. Simply not bringing a car to work will reap employees an extra £600.

Some staff at the DCLG with IT qualifications get £3,000 while those hired as accountants are paid an additional £3,000.

Discretionary allowances of up to £4,000 are also awarded to 'experts' such as economists, scientists, statisticians, social researchers, geographers and engineers.

The soon to be scrapped Audit Commission shelled out £1.7million in perks and allowances in the last financial year.

A three-year allowance for 'excess fares' was also offered to staff asked to relocate. And more than £20,000 was paid out to officials for what most workers would regard as normal commuting costs.

Most of the perks are paid to long-serving staff still employed under older, generous contracts.

In Whitehall departments London-based staff are even allowed to work one hour less a day because it can take them longer to get home.

On top of generous holiday and sick pay terms, staff are also given an extra two-and-a-half 'privilege' days off every year.

A spokesman said the DCLG has halved staffing costs since the Coalition came to power.

He said: 'Only a very small number of people receive these allowances, most of which do not have origins in the Department for Communities and Local Government. The department had to honour existing terms and conditions for staff that transferred over from arms-length bodies that were closed down as part of the Government's restructuring. They are not available to anyone else.

'Some also address specific recruitment and retention issues around business critical posts that require professional skills.

'The department is in the process of reviewing its pay policies, including allowances and subsidies, as part of wider civil service reform and ensuring good value for public money.'

As part of a Whitehall clampdown on pay and perks Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude has asked managers to identify employment conditions 'that are beyond what a modern employer would provide'.
