A size 28 woman who was told she could die if she didn't lose weight has been crowned slimmer of the year - after shedding more than eight stone.

Georgina Wallace, from Feltham, London, was told by the doctor treating her mother for a fatal heart attack that the 39-year-old faced the same fate if she didn't eat more healthily.

Tipping the scales at 18 stone, Miss Wallace, a marketing manager, said food was her only comfort  after her father was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, and her mother died.

She revealed she had been overweight since primary school but her weight spiralled out of control after losing both her parents in her mid-20s.  

Now, Miss Wallace has lost more than eight stone and says slimming down hasn't only changed her life, it's saved her life.

And she has been rewarded for her hard work, as she was today named Slimming World's Consultant Slimmer of the Year 2015 for the work she does to help other people to lose weight. 

Miss Wallace said: 'I was 26 when my dad was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer, then a year later my mum had a heart attack and died just days later. 

'My world was completely thrown upside down and food was my only comfort.'

While her mother was in intensive care Georgina received some frank words from the doctor caring for her mother.

She said: 'He explained that the main reason my mum was lying in that hospital bed at just 59 years old was her weight.

'He warned me that I was heavier than her and, if I carried on the way I was going, would probably not even reach her age. Those words will stay with me forever.'

Georgina larked about with her cardboard cut out, throwing it the air as she was awarded her Slimmer Of The Year title

Following her mother's death, Miss Wallace nursed her father until he died 18 months later. Afterwards, with the doctor's warning still ringing in her ears, she tried slimming down and yo-yo dieted for more than seven years.

While she managed to lose 7st at one point, she found the diets she followed didn't help her to change her relationship with food and she struggled to manage her weight in the long term.

Name: Georgina Wallace

Age: 39

Height: 5ft 5in/1.65m

Starting weight: 18st 3½lbs

Current weight: 10st 1½lbs

Weight loss: 8st 2lbs

Starting dress size: 28

Current dress size: 10/12

Date joined Slimming World: June 2010

Date became a Slimming World Consultant: October 2013

She finally joined Slimming World in 2010 after hearing about the club's Food Optimising eating plan from an ex-work colleague.

'We'd gone out for dinner and my friend ordered a huge plate of pasta with cheese on the top and even had a glass of wine, yet she told me she could have all of this with Slimming World and still lose weight,' she said.

'I looked up my nearest group as soon as I got home and joined the very next week.

'I was terrified of walking into a room full of strangers. I thought I'd be the biggest person there and worried everyone would judge me because of my size. 

'I couldn't have been more wrong though; nobody was pointing or laughing or judging me and straightaway I felt like I was one of them. It was a magical feeling; I felt safe and I knew I belonged in that room.'

Miss Wallace, who has been married to husband Mohamed for three years, began following the Food Optimising plan and discovered a love of cooking including whipping up her favourite homemade chilli con carne with rice.

She also started slowly becoming more active by tracking her steps. Nowadays she walks around 20,000 steps a day including the 5km home from work and has taken up running, completing several 5km runs and one 10km run to raise money for charity.

Since that first night Georgina's lost 8st 2lbs, dropping from 18st 3lbs to 10st 1lbs, and after previously wearing a dress size 28 she's now a size 10/12.

Georgina said that she used food for comfort, saying that she would tuck in to her favourite dishes whenever she felt sad or angry

During this time she's also given up smoking. She says: 'For the first time in 30 years I am in control of my eating. 

'I used to treat myself with food when I was happy and comfort myself with food when I was sad or angry. Everything I've achieved has shown me that I am a strong person and I don't need to use food as an emotional crutch anymore.'

In October 2013, after losing nearly 7st, Georgina decided that she felt so passionately about the difference her own weight loss had made to her life that she wanted to help other people to slim down in the same way. 

She trained as a Slimming World Consultant and opened her own group in Hanworth, which she runs alongside her full-time job. 

Georgina started Slimming World first and then started to introduce exercise into her life, she now walks everywhere and has taken part in several runs 

Miss Wallace said: 'I've been a Consultant for nearly 18 months now. Knowing that every week my members are changing their lives and I'm helping them to do that makes me so proud.

'They motivate and help me to stay on track in my own journey too, so this award is for them as well as me.

'I'm fitter and healthier – my doctor says I have 'perfect' blood pressure – than I have ever been in my life, so I always say that losing weight hasn't only changed my life it's saved my life. 

'I would love to go back to the hospital and thank the doctor who looked after my mum because even though I didn't act on his words straightaway I never forgot them. 

'My only regret is that my parents died before I took control of my weight, I know they'd be extremely proud of me though.'

Miss Wallace's next challenge is to fulfil a lifetime ambition to scuba dive. She says: 'I have always loved the water but the fear of putting on a wet suit has always held me back. Now I've lost weight I feel like I can do anything so this is definitely top of my to-do list.' – ends –
