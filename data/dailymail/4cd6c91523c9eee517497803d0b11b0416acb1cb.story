They faced harsh reviews when they dropped the Yves and the calligraphy-style font during a major rebrand.

And now French giant Saint Laurent come under fire again - this time for extraordinarily high pricing.

First it was revealed last month that the luxury fashion house reportedly priced a jacket at £40,420.

And now it has been discovered that the embellished babydoll dress Cara Delevingne wears in its latest Fall 13 campaign is being sold for an eye-watering £48,830.

The mindboggling price was reported by Style.com in an article about the opening of a new Saint Laurent store in New York's Soho.

The jacket cost £43,000, and the cut is based on the Le Smoking suit style form the 1960s

The jacket was available to buy on 
the British Saint Laurent site up until three weeks ago before it disappeared.

After the price was reported on multiple fashion sites, reporters from the Fashion Spot say that they made contact with YSL's 
personal shopper service and were told the jacket was not in stock
anywhere in Europe.

They were not able to find a record of the garment 
ever having been sold in the US, and it was not known whether the jacket was removed, or had simply sold out.

The item description for the expensive leopard print jacket calls it an 'open jacket in grain de poudre wool' - the luxe wool Saint Lauren use to make their Le 
Smoking suits.

But the item contains only 10 per cent of this fabric. The rest is made up of 80 per 
cent polyester and 10 per cent satin.

Saint Laurent Paris currently sells Le Smoking tuxedo trousers made entirely from grain de poudre wool for less than £1,000.

The jacket, while composed of fancy sequin embroidery in Saint Laurent's signature babycat leopard print, is made almost entirely of synthetic fibres.

One web user, named fashionista-ta said in the Fashion Spot's forum thread: 'I can understand needing to cut costs on this piece, but what about non-virgin wool instead of polyester?? Even (perhaps especially) filthy rich people sweat.'

Recent reports say prices at luxury 
brands are determined by analysts whose interest lies in creating giant profit margins, sometimes even against a designer's 
wishes.

They decide on costs to consumers according to what they think customers are willing to spend on high fashion, not what it 
costs to produce it.

And with shoppers willing to pay the price, it looks as though these kinds of high price points might just be the new norm at the fashion house.

ShopStyle fashion expert Sian O'Flaherty told the MailOnline: 'Obviously, the average person could never afford a £43,000 dress (are we sure those 000's aren't a typo?!).

'That said, the artistry that has been put into high-end designer pieces is what makes them so unique, and is why I am so  inspired by the fashion that comes out of the high-end designer labels.'

The Fashion Spot enquired with the 
Saint Laurent press office for information on the production of the 
jacket and how the brand determined the price, but have not heard back.

We contacted Saint Laurent this morning with similar questions and are yet to hear back from them.

Dana Thomas, the journalist who wrote Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster, an exposé about how luxury became a global, multibillion dollar industry, answered some of the Fashion Spot's questions about how brands determine price:

'When it comes to brands in major groups, the sole motivating factor is profits. The designers can dream up beautiful designs, but the number crunchers will cut costs wherever they can to raise the profit margin.

'I also know that at times, designers like to use cheap fabrics not because they don't cost much but because of the effect they cause creatively. But even if the fabric costs $2 a metre, and the dress costs $50 to produce, the number crunchers will price it at $3,000 retail. Because they can.

'One designer told me a case where this happened and he even protested the high price. And the number crunchers didn't care. Their argument: consumers will pay it. And they did.​'
