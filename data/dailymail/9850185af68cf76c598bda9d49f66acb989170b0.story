Take a look around this giant graveyard of 60,000 trolleys which are waiting to be refurbished and sent back to supermarkets across Europe.

Instead of being scrapped, the metal contraptions are taken to the Reviva factory in Tibshelf, Derbyshire.

But that’s not the end of the line for these trolleys, which are re-built and shipped back out to stores such as Tesco, Asda and Morrisons.

Trained workmen bring the tired and broken trolleys of all shapes and sizes back to life so they can be used again by shoppers.

Reviva reconditions supermarket trollies of all shapes and sizes from across the UK and Europe

Reviva, a part of Storetec UK, has reconditioned and recycled more than 160,000 trolleys in the past four years.

From wobbly wheels to a damaged baskets, the staff at Reviva work hard to recycle the trolleys, which makes sound economic and environmental sense.

Storetec managing director Tony Barber said the number of trolleys being
sent for re-manufacturing has increased from 8,000 in 2008 to more than 
60,000 in 2011 – a 750 per cent increase.

During this time, the process which sees the trolleys completely 
recondition has saved more than 12,000 tonnes of CO2 for retailers by 
re-manufacturing more than 150,000 trolleys.

A triple-layer protective finish is put on the metal while every trolly 
is fitted with new plastics and castors to ensure it 'deliver years of 
reliable performance'.

Backed by a 30-month warranty, Reviva claim the trolleys are the affordable, eco-friendly alternative to buying new.

'Demand for more carbon efficient production combined with tougher 
economic times has pushed re-manufacture up the agenda,' Mr Barber said.

'Ultimately, this helps retailers save money on their equipment, which means less cost being passed onto the consumer.

'Moreover, it is helping retailers meet their CSR commitments by reducing their carbon footprint.'

And the future is looking bright for the company even though the economy is stalling.

Storetec say the number of trolleys being sent for re-manufacturing has increased from 8,000 in 2008 to more than 60,000 in 2011 - a 750 per cent increase

'The evidence suggests that, over the coming years, we will see retailer
demand for re-manufactured trolleys continue to grow, as economic and 
environmental concerns weigh heavier and financial constraints get ever 
tighter.'

The first shopping trolley was 
introduced on June 4, 1937, by Sylvan Goldman, owner of the Piggly 
Wiggly supermarket chain in Oklahoma City, America.

He wanted to help customers move more groceries.

Teaming up with one of his employees, Fred Young, a mechanic, they made first shopping cart using a metal frame that held two wire baskets.

Another mechanic, Arthur Kosted, developed a method to mass produce the carts by inventing an assembly line capable of forming and welding the wire.

The invention did not catch on immediately. Men found them effeminate while women found them suggestive of a baby carriage.

After hiring male and female models to push his new invention around his store, shopping carts became extremely popular and Goldman became a multimillionaire.

Now millions of trolleys are used around the world.

It is estimated that missing shopping trolleys cost UK supermarkets £8million a year.
