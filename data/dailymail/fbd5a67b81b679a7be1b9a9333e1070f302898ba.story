Leaders of clowns gathered for a convention in Mexico City said Wednesday they are saddened that a killer disguised himself as a clown to kill a drug lord last week, and insisted no true member of their profession would have committed the crime.

Convicted drug trafficker Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix was shot to death Friday in the Baja beach resort of Los Cabos by a gunman wearing a clown costume, including a wig and a rubber nose.

The dead man was the eldest brother of Mexico's once-feared Arellano Felix clan.

Clown leader Tomas Morales, a 21-year veteran of the trade who goes by the stage name ‘Payaso Llantom,’ said he was certain the killer was not a professional clown. He said clowns in Mexico, especially in outlying states, know each other and their costumes and makeup are individualized and recognizable.

‘The people who do that, they're not 
clowns. I can swear on my mother's grave it wasn't a clown,’ said 
Morales, whose costume includes frizzy blue hair and a tiny top hat. ‘We
 are not like that ... we are nonviolent.’

‘Bufon Marley,’ the stage name of 
49-year-old Alberto Villanueva, who dresses a bit like a medieval 
jester, said of the killer, ‘It's sad that it has fallen to that level.’

‘I don't think it has anything to do 
with us; we do the complete opposite,’ Villanueva said. ‘I don't think 
it will hurt our profession, because in our communities, people know 
us.’

Morales said there have been past cases of thieves stealing clown costumes to commit crimes.

‘We clowns suffer robberies,’ Morales
 said. ‘The criminals have stolen our vehicles, our costumes, our sound 
equipment, our makeup, and with these same tools we use to work, they 
use them to commit robberies.’

An estimated 500 clowns from around 
Mexico and the rest of Latin America gathered Wednesday at the 
International Clown Meeting and held a 15-minute laugh-a-thon ‘to 
demonstrate their opposition to the generalized violence that prevails 
in our country.’

As hard as it might sound to be a 
clown in a country so riven by crime and violence, the laughing came 
naturally, Villanueva said.

‘We laugh at the very things that hurt us,’ he said. ‘It is a very special, very Mexican humor.’

A spokesman for state prosecutors, describing Felix's murder, said: ‘A person dressed as a clown took his life,’ adding that the gunman fled the scene.

'He was hit by two bullets, one in 
the chest and one in the head,' Isai Arias, a Baja California state 
government official, said.

Local media reported that the killer 
had two accomplices when he attacked the former drug lord at a rented 
beach house, but this was not yet clear.

Arellano Felix spent nearly 15 years behind bars for drug-related offenses after his arrest in Mexico in 1993.

He was extradited to the U.S. in 2006 and after being granted parole and released he returned to Mexico in 2008.

'He was never really part of the 
leadership of the big organization, mostly because he was in jail [in 
Mexico]. He was arrested before they became what they really became,' 
John Kirby, a former federal prosecutor in San Diego, who co-wrote a 
2003 indictment against the cartel, said.

Another official working with state 
prosecutors said Arellano Felix, the oldest of the brothers who headed 
the gang, was not wanted by authorities at the time of his death.

The possibility that his killer had ties to organized crime was being investigated, the official said.

Arellano Felix had been arrested in 
1993 in connection with the murder of Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus
 Posadas Ocampo, and served a ten-year sentence for weapons possession.

Mexican officials were concerned that
 he would return to drug trafficking after serving his Mexican sentence 
and asked their U.S. counterparts to seek his extradition.

'The Mexicans were very concerned he was going to get out,' Mr Kirby said.

He found enough evidence to bring 
charges and Arellano Felix was extradited to the U.S. in 2006 to face 
California charges stemming from a 1980 case in which he allegedly sold 
cocaine to an undercover police officer.

Led by a large family of brothers and
 sisters, the Tijuana Cartel was one of the most powerful drug gangs in 
Mexico until it was gradually weakened by the capture or killing of 
several leading members.

Arellano Felix's younger brothers, 
Francisco Javier, Benjamin and Eduardo are serving prison sentences in 
the U.S. Another of his brothers, Ramon, was killed in a shootout with 
police in 2002.
