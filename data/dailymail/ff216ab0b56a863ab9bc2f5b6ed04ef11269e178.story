Thousands of chanting demonstrators took to Syria’s streets yesterday denouncing beleaguered President Bashar al-Assad’s latest bit to stop the protests tearing his country apart.

In a televised address, he promised his regime would consider political reforms by the end of the year but gave no sign that he would step down – the key demand of a nationwide protest that has seen 1,300 killed in a brutal crackdown by security forces.

Instead of reaching out to the protestors, he blamed the anti-government demonstrations on a small group of 'saboteurs' that was exploiting popular grievances.

'Vandalism, not reform': Syria's President Assad hit out at 'saboteurs' are trying to exploit legitimate demands for reform

'What is happening has nothing to do 
with reform. It has to do with vandalism,' Assad told supporters at 
Damascus University, where he stood before red, white and black Syrian 
flags. 'There can be no development without stability, and no reform 
through vandalism.'

Within hours, protestors were back on the streets braving security forces to give their defiant and clear answer.

In Irbin, a suburb of the Syrian 
capital Damascus, 300 demonstrators chanted : 'No to dialogue with 
murderers,' while in the Sunni Sleibeh and Raml al-Filistini districts 
of the coastal city of Latakia, where several Sunni neighbourhoods have 
been surrounded by troops and armour for weeks, protesters chanted 
'liar, liar'.

Assad’s speech came hours after Foreign Secretary William Hague warned that the leader must implement reforms or 'step aside.'

'The United Kingdom looks to him,' Mr
Hague said, 'to respond to legitimate grievances, to release prisoners 
of conscience, to open up access to the internet and freedom of the 
media.'

He called on Turkey, which has 
provided shelter to some 10,000 refugees fleeing the crackdown, to put 
pressure on the Assad regime that they are losing legitimacy.

Assad’s 70-minute, TV address was 
only his third public speech since the pro-democracy uprising began in 
March, inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. Much of his 
message was not new, including his claim that the unrest is being driven
by armed thugs and foreign conspirators.

Despite saying that he would consider
ending his Baath Party’s monopoly on power, the opposition immediately 
dismissed the speech, saying it lacked any clear move toward democracy.

Walid Al-Bunni, of the Syrian 
Opposition, said : 'It was a very disappointing speech. The regime has 
no realisation that this is a mass street movement demanding freedom and
dignity. Assad has not said anything to satisfy the families of the 
1,400 martyrs or the national aspiration of the Syrian people for the 
country to become a democracy.'

Mulhem Drubi, leader of the Muslim 
Brotherhood, dismissed it.  'A theoretical speech as always,' he said, 
'He repeated old promises that do not offer a solution and are not 
implemented on the ground. He kept on saying Syria was subject to a 
conspiracies that he likened to germs. He has been giving promises since
day one. The street will continue its march toward freedom.

'He promised to hold the killers 
accountable. But the killers are his relatives and clique. First among 
them is his brother Maher, then the rest of the security apparatus.'

One activist in Latakia said: 'People
were still hoping he would say something meaningful that would result 
in tanks and troops leaving the streets. They were disappointed and 
started going out as soon as Assad finished talking,'

Protests spread to other Syrian 
cities and in Hama, scene of a 1982 attack to crush an uprising led by 
the Muslim Brotherhood that killed thousands of civilians during the 
rule of Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad, protesters chanted 'damn your 
soul, Hafez'.

Demonstrations also took place in the
eastern city of Albu Kamal on the border with Iraq, the southern city 
of Deraa and other towns in the Hauran Plain, cradle of the uprising, 
now in its fourth month, and at the campus of Aleppo University, 
activists said.

Clearly intent on riding out the 
storm of protests, Assad, 45, who inherited power in 2000 after his 
father’s death, has made a series of overtures to try to ease the 
growing outrage, lifting the decades-old emergency laws that give the 
regime a free hand to arrest people without charge and granting Syrian 
nationality to thousands of Kurds, a long-ostracized minority.

He warned that the country’s economy 
will take a beating unless the unrest ends - a message aimed at his 
supporters in the business community and prosperous merchant classes.

'The most dangerous thing we face in the coming period is the weakness or the collapse of the Syrian economy,' he said.

'We want the people to back to reforms but we must isolate true reformers from saboteurs,' he said.
