Job done, boxed ticked. England finally registered the win they craved but huge questions remain over Stuart Lancaster’s team and their ability to challenge at next year’s World Cup.

This was always going to be a thankless task against cash-strapped opponents whose preparation was overshadowed by their ongoing dispute with a dysfunctional union which nearly led to the players boycotting the match.

But there was an opportunity to show progress had been made and lessons had been learned following a dismal start to the autumn series.

In the end they did enough, just.

Match ratings by CHRIS FOY at Twickenham 

Three tries, two of them in an improved second-half performance, were the least England would have expected following criticism of their attacking efforts in the QBE international defeats against New Zealand and South Africa.

The experiment of playing George Ford at fly-half, with the misfiring Owen Farrell shifted to inside centre, was no more than a partial success. Ford, on his first start for England, was quietly impressive, riding thunderous tackles — one of which led to a yellow card for Samoa centre John Leota — to finish the game comfortably in credit.

The 21-year-old amassed 13 points, landing five kicks from seven attempts, and played a hand in England’s first two tries. He will surely start against Australia in the pivotal No 10 position next Saturday.

Lancaster said: ‘There’s a lot of pressure to come on and run a game but I thought George did it well. He looked incisive in his line breaks, he’s got a great eye for the gap and his kicking game was good. He took some hits and showed a great deal of bravery. It was a really positive first start for him.

‘We have a selection decision to make but from my point of view he’s been waiting patiently for his chance and he’s put a real marker down.’

Whether Farrell starts alongside him is less certain. Fortunate to retain his place following two under-par displays, the 23-year-old made a couple of neat contributions yesterday, including a cleverly weighted pass from a wrap-around move which led to the first of Jonny May’s two tries. But the jury remains out. His kicking remains a concern and his lack of confidence is evident.

The pair will need time to forge an understanding at 10 and 12 — time England may not have with nine games left before the World Cup.

England will point to the fact two of their three tries were scored by left wing May, while his fellow wing Anthony Watson set up Mike Brown’s try following a brilliant cross-field kick by Ford. But too much of the team’s play was stuttering and lacking cohesion.

Coming into the game with five successive losses behind them, and five changes in personnel, it was understandable that nerves would play a part in the early stages. But the first 40 minutes will not live long in the memory — bar May’s well-worked try — as England again produced an error-strewn display that saw them go in 13-6 up at half-time.

Mercifully they picked up their game in the second half as Ford kicked deeper into Samoa territory but, with their vastly superior conditioning and preparation, England should have pulled clear with far more authority than they did.

Lancaster’s men blew three clear try-scoring chances, full back Mike Brown dropping two and lock Dave Attwood knocking on with the line at his mercy minutes from time after another sharp break from Ford. They would surely have been punished against better opposition.

Lancaster added: ‘I’m obviously pleased to get the win because it’s been a while coming. I’m delighted first and foremost with that and also really pleased with the performances of some young players who are making early starts in their careers. Particularly George and Anthony Watson.

‘It was a shame we didn’t take some of those opportunities at the end. They’re the ones we will need to take against Australia.’

Lancaster and his coaching team were taken aback by the ferocity of the criticism following the first two defeats of the autumn but, make no mistake, losing next week to a tired and under-strength Wallaby outfit would leave him facing a horrendous build-up to the Six Nations.

No one doubts the work ethic or desire of the coach or his team but only consistently high-quality, high-tempo displays will keep the wolves at bay and avoid a scenario like yesterday when a near capacity crowd resorted to the dreaded Mexican Wave less than 15 minutes in. It was a clear sign they were bored.

No amount of invented pageantry or heavy handed marketing can replace the crowd’s desire for blood and thunder on the pitch. As James Haskell said this week, no one will remember how good England’s culture is if they don’t win any matches.

They will need to improve to beat the Wallabies next week. Too many players failed to leave a mark on this game, with Haskell knocking on too often, Ben Morgan struggling to make an impact and Brad Barritt unable to provide any real thrust alongside Ford and Farrell in the outside centre position. Scrum-half Ben Youngs was quiet while hooker Rob Webber did not carry as Lancaster may have hoped.

Brown was also guilty of those two dropped passes when the try line was in view, although his pass to set up May’s second was sweetly executed and he otherwise enjoyed a tidy game.

But tidy is not enough for England. They need to demonstrate an ability to tear sides to pieces.

There is little threat of that at the moment.
