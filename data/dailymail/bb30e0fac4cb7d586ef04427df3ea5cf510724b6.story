The order of service has been released for Nelson Mandela's memorial tomorrow, which is expected to be the biggest ever such gathering of world leaders in history.

Speeches will be made by the heads of some of the world's biggest economies and the service shows how leaders are setting aside their political differences to commemorate one of history's great peacemakers.

The memorial will feature tributes by some of the anti-apartheid icon's family and a speech from United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

Cuban President Raul Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama will also give speeches of thanks for the work and legacy of Mr Mandela.
