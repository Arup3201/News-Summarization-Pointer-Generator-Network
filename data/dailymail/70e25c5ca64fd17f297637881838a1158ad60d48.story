John Inverdale has been axed from his role covering Wimbledon for BBC Radio 5 Live after he sparked a sexism storm last summer.

The BBC was bombarded with complaints when Inverdale suggested French player Marion Bartoli - who went on to become women's champion - was 'not much of a looker'.

Just days after Inverdale claimed the gaffe was due to hayfever, the corporation announced Clare Balding would be replacing him on the radio station for this year's tournament.

Inverdale suggested French champion Marion Bartoli's father may have told her she'd never be 'a looker'

Balding, 43, had previously been the station's Wimbledon host but the in-demand presenter was unable to front the coverage last year due to other commitments.

Inverdale, 56, will continue to work on the BBC's tournament coverage with highlights on TV.

A spokeswoman for the station said: 'We have a wide team of talent that work across TV and radio at Wimbledon and John is very much a part of this again this year, and will present the daily highlights programme on BBC2, Today At Wimbledon.

'Clare Balding reprises her presenting role on Radio 5 Live, which she has done before. Due to other commitments Clare was not part of the Wimbledon team last year.'

In an interview earlier this week, Inverdale told how a bout of hayfever and efforts to fill airtime had been behind his comment last year.

The incident caused such controversy that the then culture secretary Maria Miller wrote to BBC director-general Tony Hall about the remark.

Inverdale (left) claimed this week that his comments about Bartoli (right) were caused by hayfever, adding: 'We're on air from 12 noon till 7pm with not a single word written'

The TV host will still attend Wimbledon for the BBC, presenting a daily highlights programme on BBC2

Inverdale told Radio Times magazine this week: 'I was feeling so ill that day, I had terrible hay fever and all I could think of was that I wanted to go home to bed.

'I had Andy Murray in the final the next day, I knew I had to be on form.

'Your mind is going all over the place, we're on air from 12 noon till 7pm with not a single word written and you've got to fill the time.'

The BBC received around 700 complaints after Inverdale questioned whether Bartoli's father had told her, when she was younger, that she was never going to be a 'looker ... a Sharapova ... you're never going to be 5ft 11in, you're never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that'.

The presenter later attempted to clarify the 'ham-fisted' comment and said that he had written to Bartoli to apologise for using a 'clumsy phrase'.

He has since been signed up by ITV to work alongside Bartoli, 29, for coverage of the French Open, which starts this Sunday.
