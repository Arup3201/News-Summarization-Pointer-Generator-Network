David Cameron’s biggest reshuffle of his top team was beginning to unravel last night amid a storm of controversy.

Two of his key appointments quickly ran into trouble and there was anger over a plan to compensate ousted ministers with knighthoods or major international jobs.

With Labour claiming ‘the wheels were coming off’, the Government scrambled to deal with the apparently unforeseen consequences of the ministerial shake-up.

Furore: David Cameron's controversial reshuffle of his top team has already been hit by a storm of controversy

As the backlash intensified, it emerged that:

* Mr Cameron’s candidate to be Britain’s next EU commissioner, Lord Hill, is to be forced to sell his shares in a lobbying company following warnings his appointment could be vetoed;

* His replacement as leader of the Lords, Baroness Stowell, was downgraded below full Cabinet status – to the fury of fellow peers;

* Four senior figures who left the Government are to be given knighthoods or honours in what Labour said was an ‘abuse’ of patronage;

* The ousted leader of the House of Commons, Andrew Lansley, is being lined up to replace former Labour Cabinet minister Baroness Amos in a senior United Nations post.

Conflict of interest: David Cameron has nominated Lord Hill to be the UK's next European Commissioner

In Brussels, British officials said Lord Hill would divest himself of what is thought to be a significant shareholding in the lobbying giant Huntsworth, which is owned by Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire neighbour and constituency chairman Lord Chadlington.

The move, expected to be confirmed today, follows claims that the firm’s activities in Brussels might represent a conflict of interest for Lord Hill.

At home, there was uproar in the second chamber after it emerged its new leader, Baroness Stowell, will not be a full member of the Cabinet – unlike predecessors for the last 112 years.

Labour suggested the expected awards for departing ministers indicated Mr Cameron was using the honours system and patronage to reward those who went quietly in Tuesday’s ‘night of the long knives’, which saw 11 men leave the Government.

Mr Lansley, who has previously joked that he once told the Prime Minister he wanted to be made ‘Governor general of Bermuda’, is expected to be nominated to succeed Lady Amos as the UN’s under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs.

The appointment would make Mr Lansley, who was the Prime Minister’s boss at the Conservative Research Department, the most senior British figure at the world body.

The appointment is made by the UN secretary general, but usually after a signal from a world leader. Mr Cameron smoothed the path for Lady Amos’s appointment in 2010.

Sir John Holmes, the former British ambassador to Paris, was appointed to the post on the say-so of Tony Blair, who gave him the job as a consolation prize after he declined to appoint him as ambassador to Washington or as head of the Foreign Office.

Ex-ministers who will get knighthoods include Alan Duncan, who left his post as international development minister, and Hugh Robertson, a Foreign Office minister and former Olympics minister. They are in line to be made knights commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.

Oliver Heald, who was solicitor general, will also be knighted. Veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, 74, who also left the Government this week, is being chosen for one of the highest honours in the land, becoming a companion of honour.

This elite order is conferred by the sovereign for service of national importance, independently of Downing Street.

Soon to be a sir? Alan Duncan

Recipients include astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, naturalist David Attenborough and former prime minister John Major.

Labour did not question Mr Clarke’s expected honour, given his service to politics for more than 40 years.

But Michael Dugher, the party’s Cabinet Office spokesman, said of the other awards: ‘Dishing out hush-hush honours and gongs as golden goodbyes, just to keep his sacked ministers happy, also shows how weak David Cameron is. The wheels have all come off Cameron’s reshuffle.

‘He was so busy organising photo ops that he’s forgotten to do the real work.’

London Labour MP Stephen Pound said: ‘I’ve nothing against long-service medals, but using honours to sweeten the pill of dismissal is an abuse.’

Challenged in the Commons, Mr Cameron said: ‘I make no apology for saying that I think in public life we should recognise public service, people who have worked hard, people who have contributed to our nation, contributed to our government. That is a good thing to do.’

Downing Street refused to confirm any of the expected gongs.

But a source said: ‘These sorts of awards have long been conferred for public service. In terms of Hugh Robertson, he played an absolutely pivotal role in the Olympics which was one of the greatest events of modern times.’

In 2012, several ministers who lost their government positions were similarly recommended to the Queen for honours and Labour made like recommendations while in power.

She was dubbed the queen of the Downing Street ‘catwalk’ after being pictured sashaying to Number 10  in the Cabinet reshuffle.

Yesterday, however, Employment Minister Esther McVey chose a rather more practical look as she visited a bicycle factory with David Cameron.

Gone were the high heels and glamorous split skirt. Instead, she and the Prime Minister showed they were getting straight down to business with matching steel toecapped trainers provided by the Brompton Bicycle factory in west London.

Miss McVey laughed off any suggestion she was unhappy at being referred to as a catwalk queen in media coverage, telling reporters it was ‘fine if it inspires girls to go into politics’.
