She is the world’s first ‘living’ doll, with her long fair hair and trendy clothes ‘My Friend Cayla’ can chat about hobbies and help with homework.

She is designed to sync with a smartphone or tablet which allows her to recognise a child’s speech and conduct simple conversations.

Questions posed by a little girl are transposed into text using Google software to allow Cayla to search of the web to find an answer. The doll then recites what she has found out.

As a result, it will be possible for little girls ‘to have in-depth chats with their new best friend’, according to the manufacturer, Vivid.

Cayla’s ability to surf the web is limited by Google’s SafeSearch technology, which is meant to block unsuitable content and words.

At the same time, parents can log into the smartphone app used to control her to block any words or phrases they consider unsuitable.

Cayla was described as 'world's first internet-connected doll' during the Toy Fair 2014 at Kensington Olympia

The firm said the 18inch tall doll, which costs £59.99,  also encourages role play and dressing up.

A spokesman said if the doll thinks she has heard a swear word, or anything related to race or body parts, any internet searches are automatically shut down.

‘She will say something like ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about, let’s talk about something else’, or give no response at all,’ said a spokesman.

The whole scenario is a little reminiscent of the Stepford Wives, where a community of men created apparently perfect robot versions of their own wives with chilling results. However Vivid insists the experience with Cayla is entirely positive, even educational.

It said children can play games, read stories and talk to Cayla, who will also provide hints and tips to help them complete their homework.

The spokesman said: ‘They can talk about their likes and dislikes and hobbies. Cayla can even answer questions about maths, general knowledge and the weather.

‘She can also do lots without an internet connection such as telling stories from her database and playing games.’

The firm said the 18inch tall doll, which costs £59.99,  also encourages role play and dressing up.

Cayla is among a growing army of hi-tech dolls designed to play the role of virtual friends, which were launched at the annual Toy Fair at London’s Olympia exhibition centre.

The group also includes the Vtech ‘Little Love’, a baby that develops and grows up alongside the child. The voice activated baby doll, which costs £24.99, can speak over 100 words and 80 phrases.

Also on the shelves this Christmas will be the Nenuco Won’t Eat baby doll, who shakes her head every time someone tries to feed her. A magic spoon and persistence normally wins her round in a scenario which is designed to encourage children to eat properly.
