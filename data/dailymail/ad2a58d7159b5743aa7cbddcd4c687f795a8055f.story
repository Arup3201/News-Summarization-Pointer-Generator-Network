National Football League owners unanimously endorsed what they called a 'revised and strengthened' Personal Conduct Policy in the wake of several domestic violence incidents involving players.

'With considerable assistance from the many people and organizations we consulted, NFL ownership has endorsed an enhanced policy that is significantly more robust, thorough, and formal,' NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.

The NFL has come under fire over the last six months as it struggled with a personal conduct policy widely seen as too lenient. With big-money NFL sponsors watching closely, Goodell embarked on a mission to strengthen the policy.

High-profile players Adrian Peterson, Ray Rice and Greg Hardy have been convicted of domestic abuse over the past few months and the NFL has stumbled in some of its attempts to punish the players.

A special counsel for investigations and conduct will 'decide the discipline for violations' of the new policy, said Goodell, who will still hear appeals but may appoint an independent panel to assist him.

'The policy is comprehensive. It is strong. It is tough. And it is better for everyone associated with the NFL,' Goodell said.

The players union was not happy it was not part of the process in formulating a new policy.

'Our union has not been offered the professional courtesy of seeing the NFL's new personal conduct policy before it hit the presses,' the NFL Players Union said in a statement. 'Their unilateral decision and conduct today is the only thing that has been consistent over the past few months.'

Among the changes are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators, Goodell said.

The new policy was unveiled at a regularly scheduled owners meeting in Irving, Texas, outside Dallas.

Arizona Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill will serve as chairman of a nine-owner committee that will oversee the new policy, Goodell said. Two former players with ownership stakes also will serve on the committee, Warrick Dunn of the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers' John Stallworth.

After the criticism erupted over the summer, Goodell retained four women, including Lisa Friel, the former head of the Manhattan district attorney's sex-crimes unit, to shape the NFL's policies relating to domestic violence and sexual assault.

'We now have a layered evaluation process to take into account a diversity of expert views,' Goodell said.
