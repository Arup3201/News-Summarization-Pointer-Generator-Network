A South Florida man has reached a rare milestone. He's donated 100 gallons of blood.

Harold Mendenhall, 84, started giving blood on July 7, 1977, and has donated more than 400 times over the last 35 years.

Last month, the 183lbs man from Riviera Beach, logged his 100th gallon, The Palm Beach Post reported.

Mendenhall started donating blood when his wife, Frankie, was diagnosed with breast cancer.

When she died seven years later, Mendenhall says he was lost.

He stopped by the blood bank in West Palm Beach on his way home from work. Soon he was donating six gallons a year.

He gives platelets rather than whole blood, which means he can give two pints per donation instead of one and can give every two weeks instead of eight weeks.

Mendenhall says giving blood helped him cope with the loss of his wife and, later, two sons.

He told the Palm Beach Post: 'They always compliment me on my veins.'

Mendenhall gave his interview at the One Blood center in Lake Park, Florida, and joked to staff: 'Make sure you give me the sharp needle, not that square one.'

Over the 36 years that he's been donating, Mendenhall's 100 gallons of blood is enough to have filled the gas tanks of eight Honda Civic cars.

As well as losing his wife, the donor also lost two of his five children.

His sons died from complicated disabilities at the ages of 47 and 53.

'For some reason, I'm still here and I'm grateful. That's one of the reasons I keep donating.

'Giving blood can only be done by a human being, so that's been my payback for my career and my good health and all the blessings I've had', he said.

Before retiring, Mendenhall worked in research and development and helped develop spy planes' engines that were used during the Vietnam War and Cold War.

He worked for Pratt & Whitney in Palm Beach County.
