The idea that roll-ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong, the Chief Medical Officer has warned

The idea that roll-ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong, the Chief Medical Officer warned last night.

Professor Dame Sally Davies warned that both forms of smoking effectively ‘rot’ the body from the inside.

She said that contrary to popular belief that roll-ups are natural and less dangerous, the tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals.

Health officials are concerned that roll-ups are becoming increasingly popular amongst smokers who see them as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes.

Figures showed that 40 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women smokers use them, up from 18 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in 1990.

But 49 per cent mistakenly believe they are less harmful, according to a survey of 627 individuals.

The Government is today  launching a new stop-smoking campaign involving a shocking TV advert showing a father-of-two rolling a cigarette – which turns into rotting tissue.

Another depicts a smoker inhaling a cigarette and then contaminated black, blood spreading to his lungs, heart and brain.

Professor Dame Sally Davies said: ‘While many smokers know the damage cigarettes do to their hearts and lungs, they are much less likely to be aware of how harmful smoking is to the body - essentially ‘rotting’ it from the inside out, and roll-ups are no exception.

‘January is a time when many people make New Year’s resolutions to improve their health and try to stop smoking.

‘Millions of people have used Smokefree support (the NHS’s stop smoking programme) and we are hoping that this year, even more will take advantage of the free expertise and resources on offer.’

Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director for Health and Wellbeing for Public Health England, the Government agency overseeing the campaign said: ‘Much of the harm caused by smoking doesn’t become obvious until middle age but the invisible damage can start shockingly early - even by the late teens.

Contrary to popular belief roll-up tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals as normal cigarettes

‘The earlier a smoker quits the better, but quitting at any age can help reverse at least some of the damage. That’s why there is no time better than now to quit.

‘Stop smoking and stop the rot.’

Figures show that fewer in one in five Britons smoke, the lowest level in 80 years.

Health officials want to bring this down even further and they are concerned that rates are much higher in deprived areas.

But Forest, which represents smokers, described the campaign as ‘rotten’, ‘poisonous’ and an ‘abuse of public money’.

Simon Clark, the director said: ‘There can't be a sane adult in the United Kingdom who isn't well aware of the health risks of smoking.

‘What's really poisonous is the way public health campaigners are constantly trying to scare and harass people with exaggerated claims and dubious statistics.

‘Campaigns like this are an abuse of public money. Education has been replaced by shrill scaremongering that is often counter-productive because it's human nature to switch off when you're being nagged or shouted at on an almost daily basis.

‘This is real life not a Hammer Horror film.’
