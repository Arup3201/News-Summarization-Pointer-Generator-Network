The world's oldest underground railway carriage has been restored to its former glory - after being used as a garden shed.

Carriage 353 was built in 1892 and took Victorian workers to their offices in the capital when the London Underground had first class compartments.

It had gold leaf lettering, plush claret seating, and ornate gas lamps to illuminate the passengers' journeys.

But it was retired from the Circle Line in 1905 and later did 30 years service on a railway line in the West Country.

When the line closed in 1940 it was turned into a shop, then a clubhouse for US soldiers in the war and finally a crumbling garden shed.

But railway enthusiasts discovered the rotting carriage and realised it was the oldest known example.

A team of craftsmen at The Festiniog and Welsh Highland Railway in North Wales took 15 months to strip away the decades of decay and patiently rebuild the magnificent carriage.

Sorry state: Pictured is the carriage on its way into the workshop before the restoration, which has made it shine again

A National Lottery grant was awarded to restore the carriage to mark the 150th anniversary of the underground

Hard at work: The craftsmen managed to save 92 per cent of the carriage's teak frame

A National lottery grant of £422,000 was awarded to restore the carriage to mark the 150th anniversary of the underground.

Andrew Thomas, of the Welsh Highland Railway, said: 'It was in a sorry state when it arrived.

'It had been used as a garden shed and had a toilet attached at the end.

'We had a team of six people including some apprentices because that was part of the deal with the Lottery Heritage Fund - they want us to teach young people new skills.

'It took an awful of of hard work but we were determined to restore it to its original pristine condition.

It took 21 coats of varnish to make the carriage sparkle again - hardly a surprise given that the carriage was built in 1892

Back to its former glory: The carriage will tour around heritage railways in London and the South East for 10 years

The carriage was 'in a sorry state when it arrived' but has been spruced up after railway enthusiasts discovered it

Patiently restored: The carriage has more than £700 worth of 23.5 carat gold leaf on the carriage

'To see the finished article was very special. To see her roll out for the first time was something else.'

The craftsmen managed to save 92 per cent of the carriage's teak frame and after repairing it used 21 coats of varnish to make it sparkling again.

All the signwriting was done by hand while modern LED lamps were fitted to give the appearance of the original gas mantles.

The carriage says Metropolitan Line on it because when the Tube opened it was called the London's underground Metropolitan railway.

There is more than half a mile of lining on the outside and more than £700 worth of 23.5 carat gold leaf on the carriage.

The carriage will tour around heritage railways in London and the South East for 10 years before takings its place in the London Transport Museum.

On 9 January this year, London Underground celebrated 150 years since the first underground journey took place between Paddington and Farringdon on the Metropolitan Railway.

A range of events have been organised to commemorate the landmark date, with Prince Charles and his wife Camilla taking a ride on the Tube and a journey by a 19th Century steam train.

1863: London's underground Metropolitan or Met welcomes its first passengers. Within a month it would be welcoming 26,000 passengers a day.

1869:The East London Railway starts running steam trains through the Thames Tunnel. Built by Marc Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it was originally opened as a foot tunnel in 1843 for pedestrians to travel under the river between Rotherhithe and Wapping. It now forms part of the London Overground railway network.
