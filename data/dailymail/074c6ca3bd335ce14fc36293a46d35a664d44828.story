Four years after Rachelle Friedman became paralyzed as a result of an accident at her own bachelorette party, the North Carolina woman announced that she and her husband are expecting.

Friedman, 28, took to her Facebook page Wednesday to share with the world the good news.

'We are going to have a baby!!' she wrote. 'Due date? April 19th. We are elated.'

Friedman, who is quadriplegic, is using a surrogate mother - her friend from college Laurel Humes - to carry the baby to term for her.

The surrogacy plan has been in the works for months, and Friedman has been anxious for her friend to become pregnant. 

As recently as last week, Friedman shared a photo on her Facebook page showing her, husband Chris and their surrogate, Mrs Humes, at a fundraiser.

The image was accompanied by the status update: 'Crossing our fingers she's pregnant right now.'

Just days before making it official, Rachelle Friedman posed with her husband and her friend's first ultrasound printout.

'First family photo,' the elated mother-to-be wrote.   

Friedman postponed her wedding to fiance Chris Chapman for a year after the shocking accident in 2010 in which she broke her neck after being playfully pushed into a pool.

In June, Laurel Humes, 31, a friend of Friedman's from college, volunteered to carry Chris and Rachelle's child after following her old friend's story and hearing how she and Chapman were trying to raise $60,000 to pay for a surrogate.

Friend in need: Humes and Friedman knew one another in college and now Humes is going to carry Friedman's child for her

Friedman's most dearly-held wish was to have a family, and she was elated when doctors told her that despite her catastrophic injury, she would be able to carry a child to term.

'It was very scary,' she told People earlier this summer. 'I knew I was paralyzed and the first thing I asked the paramedics was whether I could have kids. I was ecstatic when they said yes.'

However, her joy turned to sorrow when she discovered that medications she must take for her blood pressure can be dangerous to a fetus.

After reading a post on Friedman's blog about needing a surrogate, Humes, a stay-at-home mother of one, knew she wanted to help.

'My husband was a sperm donor for some of our friends, a same-sex couple, and that inspired me to think about surrogacy," Humes of Asheville, North Carolina, told People.

'I'm really excited,' she said at the time. 'I know Chris and Rachelle will be great parents and I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when they get to hold their baby for the first time.'

Doctors have retrieved Friedman's eggs transferred the fertilized embryos into Humes sometime in July.

The 28-year-old and her husband Chris, from North Carolina, had launched a crowdfunding campaign in May in a bid to raise money for the procedure, which can cost up to $120,000.

Friedman says that although she wants a girl, her husband said he would like a 'fishing buddy.' Her August 13 Facebook post made no mention of the baby's sex.

But their prayers were unexpectedly answered just weeks after setting up their page.

Chapman said: 'We had a college friend of ours who 
stepped forward and wanted to help out.

'She said she'd already been 
looking into surrogacy and wanted to help us start a family.'

His overjoyed wife added: 'It's amazing, it wouldn't be possible without her. Surrogacy is astronomically expensive, it's crazy.'

Touching on the discrimination she faced after announcing she wanted children, she added: 'A lot of 
people . . .  don't think someone in a wheelchair can be a mother, that 
I'm not physically able to take care of a kid but people underestimate 
my abilities.

Even with their surrogate stepping in for free, the Chapmans say lawyer fees and other expenses will 'add up.'

Their fundraising page remains active, and so far they have collected $14,165 in donations.

Hopes and dreams: 'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted in May 

Friedman has published a book, The Promise: A Tragic Accident, a Paralyzed Bride, and the Power of Love, Loyalty, and Friendship, which delves into her life before and after she became paralyzed.

The accident occurred in 2010, 
just weeks before her wedding, when the bride-to-be was at her own 
bachelorette party with her four bridesmaids.

When
 the girls decided to take a dip in the hotel pool one night, one of 
them pushed her in and she fell too close to the shallow end.

'I broke my neck upon impact, became paralyzed from the chest down and would never walk again,' she told xoJane.com. It took two-and-a-half months of intensive physical therapy for Friedman to rebuild her upper body strength and regain movement in her arms and fingers.

Instead
 of resenting her friend, however, Friedman chose to keep her name 
secret from the press, in order to prevent them from hounding her and 
making her feel guiltier than she already did.

'She
 is and will always be one of the my closest friends,' she stated, 
explaining that her decision to keep her friend's identity a secret is 
something she never once questioned.

'It's not our sisterly bond that keeps
 me from saying her name in interviews,' she wrote. 'It's the fact that 
she's a human being.'

Friedman also revealed that the friend who pushed her into the pool has been instrumental in her journey towards motherhood.

'I feel very grateful to have her support and love,' she wrote.
