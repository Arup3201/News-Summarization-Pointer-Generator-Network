A New York City morning show correspondent who had to deliver a live report in a bikini was also forced to endure the inappropriate comments of an over-excited Fox anchor back in the studio.

One could be forgiven for thinking Good Morning New York co-host Greg Kelly, 45, had never seen a woman in a swimsuit, such was his enthusiasm for a bikini-clad Anna Gilligan, who went to New Jersey's Action Park to try out the new Tarzan rope swing.

The segment was a lighthearted report on the park's new attractions but became increasingly awkward as Kelly, the son of former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly, was unable to contain his enthusiasm for Gilligan's figure.

Demanding job: Kelly said she didn't know which was more scary - disrobing on live TV or the Tarzan ride - but little did she know there was worse to come

Making a splash: Gilligan went flying through the air, plunged into the water and made it back in front of the camera in record time

Inappropriate: That's when things became somewhat awkward, with Kelly repeatedly commenting about her body despite his co-host's admonishments

'I don’t know which is scarier, the ride of taking off my clothes,' Gilligan said before stripping off her robe and swinging out over the water before letting go.

'Wow, here she goes - in a two-piece!' Kelly observed as Gilligan took the plunge into the water.

She swam over the the edge of the water and emerged dripping wet to put her earpiece back in and report back on her experiences in record time, as Kelly observed, 'Look at her, it's like something out of a movie... Indeed.'

His co-host in the studio Rosanna Scotto urged him to 'stay appropriate,' but before Gilligan could get a word in, Kelly had leered, 'Nice swimsuit,' and asked her why she was so out of breath.

Gilligan admirably ploughed through it, ignoring Kelly's remarks before attempting to sign off so she could go and get dressed again, but Kelly wasn't having it.

Awkward: An enthusiastic Kelly was so eager to keep the reporter on-screen even as she tried to sign off that the cameraman took the camera off Gilligan to focus it on the pool

Unimpressed: Kelly's co-host Rosanna Scotta warned him repeatedly to 'be nice' and 'stay appropriate' before finally asking him, 'What is wrong with you?'

Later: The High Anxiety ride Anna Gilligan tried out later in the day can't have caused her any more grief than the swimsuit segment with Greg Kelly

'Hold on a second, not so fast Anna!' he shouted, before asking her a series of pointless questions.

'I just want to talk to her for a little while,' Kelly told Scotto after she admonished him to 'be nice' and 'stop milking this shot.'

The camera operator even took pity on Gilligan, turning the camera away from her to focus on the pool instead of the embarrassed reporter.

'Anna, go dry off, we’ll see you in a little bit,' Scotto, finally said before scolding her colleague. 'What is wrong with you?'

Host with the most: It's unclear whether Greg Kelly was the subject of such admiration when he appeared in his swimsuit in 2013

'Don't be so frowning at me,' Kelly told a disapproving Scotto.

The last time Kelly was in the news instead of reporting it was 2012, when he was accused of rape by a New York woman.

The District Attorney ultimately decided to drop the charges against him.
