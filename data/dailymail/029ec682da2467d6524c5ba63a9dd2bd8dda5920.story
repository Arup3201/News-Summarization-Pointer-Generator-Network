Wolves returned to winning ways by beating promotion rivals Middlesbrough thanks to Bakary Sako’s cheeky penalty and Nouha Dicko’s brilliant solo goal.

Boro hadn’t suffered defeat for seven Championship matches but were undone as Sako chipped in from 12 yards and Dicko dribbled through to slam into the roof of the net.

It was a first win in five games for Kenny Jackett’s team as they moved to fourth, although there was a sour note as Sako picked up a groin injury and Dicko limped off with a dead leg.

Kenny Jackett rates Sako’s chances of making Saturday’s trip to Leeds at evens, but Dicko should recover in time.

The pair are fast forming one of the Championship’s deadliest duos and now have 11 goals between them. Aitor Karanka was furious his side had failed to heed his warning about the pair. ‘I’m disappointed because the players lacked intensity and we knew their main dangers were Sako and Dicko,’ he said.

Dicko’s goal 17 minutes from the end was reward for a fine performance. Collecting the ball from Dave Edwards on the left he cut in between two Boro defenders and finished emphatically.

Dicko also won the penalty for the opening goal. Sako slipped the ball through to the 22-year-old on the edge of the box and in desperation to avert the danger George Friend got too close, giving Dicko reason to fall. Referee Carl Berry gave it. 

Sako stepped up and dinked a Panenka penalty that Andrea Pirlo would have been proud of. It was his seventh goal of the season. He is out of contract next summer and Wolves are anxious to tie down their star player.

Of equal concern is the fact both players could be off to the African Cup of Nations in January to represent Mali. ‘We want forwards who have good reputations,’ said Jackett.

Wolves had been stuttering a little and dramatically collapsed in their last match at Millwall to draw from 3-0 up. Those late goals brought the total conceded in their previous four games to 11, having begun the campaign letting in only three in eight. They were much tighter last night.

Boro did put Wolves under pressure after the opening goal, and Jackett was annoyed his team seemed to slack off. First Patrick Bamford set up Jelle Vossen, whose half-volley wasn’t the cleanest but looped over Ikeme and onto the crossbar. 

Then Vossen played in Bamford, who fired a strong shot that Ikeme punched to Vossen. His strike hit Ethan Ebanks-Landell and as appeals for handball went up from the visitors Bamford tested Ikeme again. Soon after, Ikeme held from Vossen’s header.

The Wolves’ goalkeeper almost allowed an equaliser after the interval, however, slipping as he caught Adomah’s cross and taking the ball perilously close to crossing the line. Boro appealed in vain.

Wolves reacted and twice went close. Lee Evans somehow contrived to miss when James Henry’s free-kick from the left found him inside the six-yard box. Dave Edwards then sent his downwards header into the post from the same position when picked out by Henry from the other flank.
