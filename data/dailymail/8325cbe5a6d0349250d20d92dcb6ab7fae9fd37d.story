They're from different walks of the showbiz world, but actress Gwyneth Paltrow, cyclist Victoria Pendleton and TV presenter Emma Forbes all share the same health secret when it comes to staying fighting fit.

The famous trio swear by Bee Prepared - a daily defence vitamin being dubbed the latest 'It Vit'.

Bee Prepared is an immune support vitamin packed with powerful antioxidants and one key nutrient: bee propolis.

It Vit: Gwyneth Paltrow and other celebrity heath junkies are raving about Bee Prepared - a vitamin packed with bee propolis which is designed to boost immunity

The tablets - which come in a pack of 30 and taken daily - are designed to fight colds, flu, hay fever, and are also ideal for sports training and fitness, so it's no wonder Olympic gold-winning cyclist Victoria Pendleton is a fan.

Bee propolis is a resinous mixture honey bees collect from tree buds, sap flows or other botanical sources, and has been used to treat colds and flu, immunity, mouth ulcers and wound healing.

The tablets also contain powerful nutrients such as astaxanthin, elderberry, olive leaf and beta glucans - a unique blend of ingredients from the 
hive, field and forest that aren't often 
found in a regular diet or multivitamin.

The stars take a capsule of Bee Prepared - which is available online and from health food shops - once daily to help maintain their healthy immune systems.

Writing on her daily Goop blog, health junkie Gwyneth wrote: 'I was recently given "bee venom therapy" for an old injury and it disappeared.

'I was recommended bee pollen, raw honey and propolis for various purposes. So far, these recommendations have worked for me.'

Emma Forbes also raved about it on her blog. She wrote: 'I am a firm believer in the power of honey.

'When my kids were little I used to make something called "mummy magic" which was manuka honey in hot water with lemon juice.

'It worked miracles on sore throats, you name it. To this day I believe honey is a really good cure for all sorts.'

Humans have been using bee propolis medicinally for centuries with Ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans using it for wound healing.

Healthy benefits: Emma Forbes wrote on her website how she swears by the bee-centered supplement

In the First and Second World Wars, propolis was used in first aid to reduce wound infection and to speed healing.

Modern day bee propolis has been used in skin care, dental care, immune support, and even cancer treatment.
