It was meant to be a magical visit, creating special memories for some children who are unlikely to live to see next Christmas.

But as dozens of children with cancer stood waiting in the cold, some risking their health to do so, it began to become clear a special Christmas visit was not going to happen.

Children and their parents waited more than an hour for a visit by the Coca Cola bus at Ronald McDonald House at The Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, only to be told the bus was not coming and given no reason why.

Many had been waiting at the roadside in wheelchairs and attached to drips, eager to catch a glimpse of the iconic truck. Others, suffering with cancer and other diseases, had risked their already fragile health by standing in the cold and families travelled from across the north west of England for the visit.

Cheryl Capper and her partner Mike Cosgrove waited with their 16-year-old daughter Emma Capper who was diagnosed with incurable bone cancer in 2010.

The family, from Cheadle, Stockport, found out that the cancer had spread to Emma's ribs and lungs last week, and said  they risked her health to wait in the cold to make happy memories fearing that this may be their last Christmas together.

Miss Capper, mother to Emma, said: 'It's potentially Emma's last Christmas and every little treat is huge. We were looking forward to getting our photo together with the truck. There were children there in wheelchairs with drips wrapped in blankets, it was heartbreaking.

'My daughter has got lung tumours, the cold air is a deterioration to her health - but we were making another memory.' 

Miss Capper said as they waited more than an hour with other families, excited to see the truck, they began to wonder if it would actually turn up. 

'I kept thinking it's late, it won't let these children down, it can't let these children down,' she added.

'I was just as excited as them.'

Staff at Ronald McDonald House were forced to tell children and their families the truck was not turning up 

The mother-of-four, from Ashton-under-Lyne, said: 'All the children were shivering. There were children there on drips and we kept having to get them extra blankets.

'My children cried all the way home.

'Some of the children there may never get the chance to see it again, that's the part that broke my heart.'

Ronald McDonald House provides free accommodation for the families of children who are being treated at Manchester Children's Hospital and St Mary's Neonatal unit.

Staff at Ronald McDonald House were forced to announce that the visit from the truck had been cancelled when it failed to show up on Sunday. 

Coca Cola said a 'miscommunication' meant the driver had not been told the correct time to turn up at the hospital and apologised for the mistake. 

A spokeswoman said: 'This was an oversight on our behalf and we're saddened to hear that many families were left disappointed. We want to try to make it up to everyone and bring happiness and Christmas cheer to the Ronald McDonald House, so we are in touch with the charity to arrange another special stop within the next week. 

'We will confirm the date and time as soon as possible. We apologise again for any inconvenience caused, but hope as many people as possible will be able to join us for a festive experience.'
