Welcome to a real-life Temple of Doom where you can re-enact Indiana Jones' wildest adventures by sliding down a Mayan temple into shark infested waters.

The water slide styled as a Mayan temple sends thrillseekers hurtling up to 35-miles-per-hour down a 60-foot-long chute.

The ride finishes underwater by going through a tunnel surrounded by 14-foot-long nurse sharks and Caribbean Reef sharks.

Aptly called The Leap of Faith, the terrifying ride is part of the Aquaventure, Paradise Island resort of the Bahamas.

Vice President of Marine Operations, Mark Gsellman explained why the slide is so popular with the visitors to his resort.

'The Leap of Faith was built to provide guests with the ultimate experience.

'No other slide compares to the exhilarating sensation and rush of adrenaline you're left with after going down the Leap of Faith.Â 

Shooting through the air, the ride can send visitors plummeting at 35 mph

As tourists reach the bottom of the slide, they enter a misty tunnel before going underwater, hence the name Leap of Faith

'The feeling of being dropped at a near perpendicular angle and flying past sharks is something you can't find anywhere else.

'The slide is called the Leap of Faith because the bottom of the slide is covered with a mist and cannot be seen, hence to drop down, it requires a true leap of faith.'

Aquaventure is a vast 141-acre water park containing 7 million gallons of water, a mile-long river ride, and a choice of 12 pools.

Alongside the life-size replica of a Mayan Temple, there is a 131-foot tall Power Tower, a 7-acre snorkeling lagoon, miles of white sand beaches and more.

The seaside paradise Aquaventure, which is one of the largest water parks in the world, also has a 131-foot tall Power Tower and a 7-acre snorkeling lagoon

'People love the Leap of Faith and certainly go through a range of emotions,' said Mark.

'Guests are first and foremost very excited, but typically grow anxious as they wait for their turn.

'Nerves tend to kick in once guests realize they are up next, and after a few minutes of fear and giddy nervousness.

'Then they finally launch themselves down the slide and experience some of the most fun you can imagine.

'It's truly an exhilarating experience.'
