Former newspaper owner Eddy Shah repeatedly raped a 14-year-old girl during sex sessions with a prostitute, a court heard yesterday.

Shah, founder of the now defunct Today newspaper, raped the teenager on six occasions in the early 1990s, it was alleged.

He paid prostitute Susan Davies for sex in ‘smart hotel rooms’, and she brought along the girl, the Old Bailey was told.

On one occasion, the youngster claims 
Shah told her while raping her that he had ‘planned this since I was a 
little girl’, it was said.

Yesterday Davies, 53, sat in the dock alongside Shah, 69, for the start of their four-week trial.

She is charged with child cruelty and 
with aiding and abetting the rape and indecent assault of the schoolgirl
by Shah. She is also accused of pimping out the youngster to a second 
man, businessman Anthony Pallant, who is accused of rape and indecent 
assault.

The girl did not tell police for 
nearly 20 years. Now 34, she was composed and clear as she gave evidence
from the witness stand yesterday.

Gillian Etherton QC, prosecuting, said
Shah, Davies and Pallant were arrested on sex charges in September 
2011. All three deny the accusations, accusing the girl of ‘a series of 
lies, malice or pure fantasy that never happened’.

But Miss Etherton said: ‘These allegations are about child abuse.

‘She was a young girl who should have had the protection of the considerably older adults around her.

‘Instead, she was used by these adults for their own selfish personal needs resulting in her sexual abuse.’

Miss Etherton said Davies, of Swanley,
Kent, was pivotal to the case and had worked for many years as a 
prostitute, slipping out in the evenings after working in the shop that 
she ran with her husband. ‘She is a woman of few moral scruples,’ added 
the QC.

She told the jury the alleged  victim 
‘was taken to a hotel where [Susan Davies] had clearly arranged to see 
and perform sexual favours for Eddy Shah’.

Jurors at the Old Bailey heard that the girl had to have sex with Shah in various upmarket hotels

She waited outside a room and, ‘a 
short while later Mr Shah came out, knelt down in front of her and asked
if she wanted to come through to the adjoining room.

‘She refused and said no.’

Davies is alleged to have turned on 
the youngster as soon as they left the suite, telling the girl: ‘You 
better ****ing do it next time.’

On the next occasion, the three met at
a hotel and the girl was ordered to strip, and Shah had unprotected sex
with her while the prostitute watched, the court heard. In the dock, 
Shah, wearing a tieless blue shirt and grey suit, slowly shook his head.

Eddy Shah, 69, from Kington Langley, near Chippenham in Wiltshire, denies the charges

Shah’s wife of 40 years, the actress 
Jennifer White Shah, who uses a wheelchair after her back was damaged 
during bouts of lifesaving cancer treatment, listened to the evidence 
from the side of the court.

The prosecutor said the girl eventually became ‘used’ to the abuse.

‘She said, to deal with it, she 
switched off and became robotic during these events,’ said Miss 
Etherton. ‘At this point in her teenage years, she now cared very little
about herself and had little self-respect or respect for adults.’

The girl said that the last time she had sex with Shah was when she was 15.

Miss Etherton said Davies had had an 
extra-marital affair with Pallant, of West Malling, Kent, and had become
‘obsessed’ with him, and had used the girl as a ‘bargaining object’ to 
maintain her affair.

Shah launched Today in 1986 and was 
known for bringing in new technology and colour pages. He sold his 
newspaper empire in 1988.

Shah, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, owned 
and ran the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club in Royal Wootton Bassett, 
before putting it on the market for £3.5million. It was sold in February
this year.

The trial continues.

Born Selim Shah in 1944 to an English mother and Iranian father, Shah was educated at Gordonstoun and a crammer in Brighton.

Finally achieving nine O-levels, he didn't go to university and instead began his career working as a theatre stage manager.

Shah moved on to the BBC and Granada where he worked as a floor manager on shows including Coronation Street, before working at the Manchester Evening News.

When he was made redundant by the paper in 1976, he decided he would never work for anyone else again, and sold his first house in Sale for £14,000 to start his own free newspapers.

Over the next decade, Shah's business took off, and he eventually built up a portfolio of 60 newspaper titles.

In 1983 he confronted the trade unions at his Warrington printworks and Manchester newspaper offices, and as owner of the Warrington Messenger he sacked six workers using the new Labour Laws.  His home was picketed for months, he was sent death threats including coffins delivered to his house, and earned the nickname the 'Shah of Warrington'.

In 1986, Shah launched Today, then seen as extremely technologically-advanced with its full colour offset printing at a time when newspapers were still using Linotype machines and letterpress.

Launched as a rival to the Daily Mail, the paper was inspired by American newspaper USA Today and had Alastair Campbell as political editor and his girlfriend (now wife) Fiona Millar as news editor.  Today was bought by Tiny Rowland's Lonrho a few months later.

Shah went on to launch the unsuccessful national tabloid The Post in 1988, but by 1989 he'd sold his entire newspaper group.

In 1989 he set up Messenger TV company, before moving to the US and writing four novels: The Lucy Ghosts (1991), Ring Of Red Roses (1992), Manchester Blue (1993), and Fallen Angels (1994).  In 2008 a further novel, thriller Second World, was published.

Shah now owns and runs golf courses, leisure centres and hotels in cluding the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club at Royal Wootton Bassett.  He has also dabbled in property development with a scheme of 44 holiday homes at his Wiltshire golf club.

He is married to actress Jennifer White Shah and they have three children.
