Tens of thousands of teenagers are avoiding being punished for crimes by simply saying sorry – even to girls they have raped.

Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that more than 30,000 young people who admitted crimes including sexual assault, violence, possession of hard drugs and carrying guns have escaped prosecution over the past year.

Instead, they have just apologised or tried to make amends. It means they do not have to go to court, risk jail or a fine, and do not receive a criminal record.

Hard time: Supporters of restorative justice say it frees up space in crowded prisons and stops first-time offenders from descending into a life of crime. But it is being used for violent and sexual offences

Supporters of the initiative, known as restorative justice or community resolution, claim it is a fairer way to deal with first-time offenders while still giving closure to those they have wronged.

But critics fear it allows young thugs to get away with serious crimes. Jack Dromey, Labour’s Shadow Policing Minister, said: ‘It is disturbing that restorative justice is being used for indictable offences including sexual assault. These figures are alarming.’

Since last April, the Home Office has required police forces to submit statistics on informal resolution, and this is the first time such detailed figures have been released.

Statistics from 40 British forces show that between April 2013 and January this year, 37,168 offences by under-18s were dealt with informally. Over the same period, 43,188 youths were prosecuted.

Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers says it is risky to deal informally with crimes such as domestic abuse or sexual assault because of the risk of further offences.

The figures, however, show that 222 sexual offences were dealt with by community resolution. In the past two years, Devon and Cornwall Police have dealt informally with three teenage rapes, while Staffordshire Police have done the same with four rapes in the past year.

In addition, 11,436 acts of violence were resolved in this way, including serious offences of wounding. There were 13 incidents of assaults on police, and dozens of public order, harassment, racist abuse and even threats to kill.

At least 152 young people were caught with weapons such as knives yet spared prosecution, and at least six when they had guns.

Common uses of restorative justice include shoplifting and criminal damage, with youths apologising to shopkeepers or painting over graffiti. But the alternative was also used in 2,436 cases of drug possession, some involving ecstasy and ketamine.

Some of the activities ordered have been criticised as too soft. In Hull, three boys who stole a cancer sufferer’s bike were told to take part in a charity run. In Lancashire, an 11-year-old who stole swan’s eggs had to ‘learn more about wildlife’.

Some victims have also questioned the measures. Deaf student Kirsty Mills agreed to restorative justice after a 13-year-old boy mocked her and pelted her home with eggs.

Police took the yob to her home near Salford to apologise, but Kirsty, 21, said: ‘He didn’t give a damn. He was smirking. I still have to get a lift to university rather than catch the bus so I can avoid him.’

A spokesman for charity the Restorative Justice Council said: ‘The scheme has been shown to reduce reoffending by 14 per cent, and four out of five victims would recommend it.’
