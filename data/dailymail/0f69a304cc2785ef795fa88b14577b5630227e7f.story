The High Street ‘Knicker Queen’ she was supposed to transform M&S’s lingerie from frumpy mummy-pants into sexy, sleek, and elegant bestsellers.

However Janie Schaffer didn't have time to perform the underwear magic she had previously worked for super brand Victoria's Secret as she resigned a mere 3 months into her post as director of lingerie and beauty for the firm in a move that has shocked the fashion world.

The 51-year-old designer is now suing Marks and Spencer for an undisclosed figure, said to be ‘well in excess’ in £1 million.

Ms Schaffer is seeking damages for Victoria's Secret shares she claims she lost out on because M&S were so keen for to start at the soonest possible opportunity.

She is also suing for the remainder of her years’ salary, having started the role in January 2013 and quit in April.

Shaffer was hired by M&S shortly before the company revealed its pre-tax profits had slumped by £31.5 million the previous year.

At the time the company boasted of her ‘stellar retail pedigree’ and saying she ‘completed’ the re-vamped clothing team.

And chief executive Marc Bolland’s excitement and confidence seemed well founded.

Janie headed up brand Knickerbox in the Eighties and Nineties, before moving to Victoria’s Secret where for five years she created sexually but classy underwear.

She and Stephen Schaffer founded Knickerbox together in 1986 and soon became the golden couple of the trade. A ferocious work ethic made Knickerbox an explosive  success

With a touch of Parisian chic, Janie seemed the master of combining sex appeal with style, and helped launch the Victoria’s secret brand into the stratosphere.

The rift with M&S came over an apparent misunderstanding of her role within the company, with Janie believing she would have total creative control over all aspects of the company’s lingerie.

A spokesperson for M&S told The Financial Times ‘This matter is in the hands of our lawyers and we have absolutely no further comment to make.’

 Born Janie Godber, she started her career at Marks & Spencer as a buyer, aged just 22.

There she fell for South African-born Stephen Schaffer, a handsome young merchandiser with an infectious entrepreneurial bent. 

They founded Knickerbox together in 
1986 and soon became the golden couple of the trade. A ferocious work 
ethic made Knickerbox an explosive success.

Before
 launching the business in October 1986 with a single shop on Regent 
Street in London, Stephen and Janie had spent six months honing their 
business plan, inspired by chains such as Sock  Shop and Tie Rack, which
 were at the time  incredibly successful.

Immediately, they grabbed attention, 
not least in June 1987 when they publicly presented Mrs Thatcher with a 
pair of electric blue knickers.

By the time they married in 1988, Knickerbox was making annual profits of £6 million.

The couple had triplet daughters  by
IVF and, by 29, Janie was the Nineties poster girl for 
businesswomen-mothers, with 120 stores across Britain and the Far East 
in her empire and raising her girls without the help of a live-in nanny.

So
devoted was she to the business  that in June 1993, just three months 
after giving birth by caesarean, she returned to work – though she left 
at 5.30pm three days a week, determined to be part of family life.

Schaffer is happy to stay out of the spotlight these days.

After
 living a seemingly charmed life making fashion headlines throughout the
 Eighties and Nineties, in 2005, at the age of 44, she embarked on a 
passionate relationship with Princess Diana’s biographer Andrew Morton 
while still married to her Knickerbox co-founder husband, Stephen. 

The
 relationship lasted only months and, soon afterwards, she emigrated to 
New York where she has lived discreetly ever since. And in 2006, the 
couple once known as the Bonnie and Clyde of the bra world divorced 
after 18 years of marriage.

Reluctant
 though he is to speak about that period, in an interview with The Mail 
on Sunday, Stephen made it clear that they have remained good friends 
throughout.
