Loic Perrin says that despite Arsene Wenger's denial he really was on the Arsenal boss's short list to help bolster the north London club's defensive ranks during the January transfer window. 

Wenger said publicly that he wasn't interested in  centre back and Saint-Etienne captain Perrin and went on to sign Brazilian Gabriel Paulista  from Villarreal for £11.2million.

But Perrin hit back saying his representation had engaged in advanced talks with Arsenal officials.

Saint-Etienne defender Loic Perrin says Arsenal were interested in signing him in the transfer window

Arsene Wenger denied the Gunners were making a play for the French defender and his club's captain

'There have been serious contacts through my agent. I think I was on a shortlist but not at the top, apparently!' he is quoted saying on goal.com. 

Perrin goes on to say that Arsenal is precisely the sort of club he would leave Les Verts for. 

'I have always said that, if I had to leave ASSE one day, it would be for a bigger club to play in the Champions League,' he said.

'A club like Arsenal. I do not think many players in Ligue 1 would refuse them.'

Wenger said he was keen to improve his side's defensive depth but that Perrin wasn't in his thinking
