A Conservative backbencher who tried to derail David Cameron’s EU policy has been left humiliated after more than 140 MPs from his own party demanded he abandon his challenge.

Adam Afriyie, a self-styled future Tory leadership contender accused of plotting against the Prime Minister, wanted to amend legislation allowing for an in-out referendum by 2017.

But he faces unprecedented pressure to withdraw his amendment after scores of Tory MPs elected in 2010 warned him it would ‘jeopardize’ the government’s bid to reshape Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

Embarrassing: More than 140 of the 147 Tory MPs first elected in 2010 have warned Adam Afriyie he must drop his challenge to the referendum bill

Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a ‘fresh settlement’ with the European Union, before staging an in-out vote before the end of 2017.

A backbench bill introduced by Tory MP James Wharton will seek to enshrine the plan into law, but faces opposition from Labour and the Lib Dems.

However, at the weekend Mr Afriyie said the public was ‘not convinced’ Mr Cameron would stick to his promise and demanded the referendum be held in 2014.

As Downing Street vowed to block his bid to amend the bill, Mr Afriye declared: ‘I didn't come into politics to be popular.’

Now he has come up against almost every Tory MP elected in 2010.

In a letter signed by more than 140 of the 147 who entered Parliament for the first time at the last election, Mr Afriyie is warned he must respect the overwhelming opposition to his plans.

‘Delivering a referendum on our membership of the EU is, as you have said, essential,’ the letter states, according to the Spectator.

‘We believe that the bill before the House provides in its current form the best opportunity to secure this outcome, in part because of its uncomplicated, unambiguous nature. This gives the Bill the best chance of progressing through the House.

‘So, whilst we recognise the sense of urgency reflected in your amendment, we feel that this will jeopardize the progress of legislation and the prospect of a referendum.

‘Knowing that you value and respect the views of colleagues we hope and request that you withdraw support for the amendment tabled in your name.’

Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was elected in 2010, said: 'Adam is a man of great charm and intelligence who has been a hugely successful businessman but in this instance his political antennae have malfunctioned.'

Andrew Percy, another Tory elected in 2010, said: 'Let's hope Adam Afriyie sees sense and drops his wrecking amendment to the EU Referendum Bill. Conservatives must unite to deliver EU referendum.'

Long-serving Conservative Sir Edward Leigh, a strong supporter of a referendum, said trying to change the Bill now would be like trying to throw a 'gallon of poison' over it.

When Mr Afriyie’s amendment emerged at the weekend prominent Eurosceptics privately expressed anger that they may be forced to choose between wrecking Mr Wharton’s bill, which they support, and voting against a referendum for which they have campaigned for years.

MPs also expressed incredulity that Mr Afriyie appeared not to have discussed the plan with any of the leading Eurosceptics.

Philip Davies, who launched the Better Off Out group in 2006, spoke for many: ‘Should there be a vote, I would be compelled to support it since it’s something I have campaigned for all my career.

‘However, I’ve never known Adam Afriyie care about the subject in his life. It’s totally self-indulgent behaviour. He’s going to put lots of my colleagues in a very difficult position.’

If Mr Afriyie had hoped to use his gambit to boost his chances of succeeding Mr Cameron, it appeared to have failed, with Tory MPs queuing up to condemn his grandstanding.
