Bolton Wanderers boss Neil Lennon described referee Mark Haywood as 'nothing short of appalling' after losing young hotshot Zach Clough and two other players to possible long-term injuries in the first half of Tuesday night's 1-1 draw against Reading.

Lennon recoiled in disgust as Kevin McNaughton was carried of on a stretcher after being kicked in the calf by Jordan Obita, David Wheater limped off with a hamstring injury and then Clough suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder after falling awkwardly on the ground following a challenge by Nathaniel Chalobah.

The diminuitive Clough, who turns 20 on Sunday, has been one of the bright spots for Bolton this season and had alread notched six goals in 2015.

No Reading players were cautioned in the first half and Lennon raged: 'Losing three players in the first half to injury was incredible. I have never seen that before.

'Zach looks like he has dislocated his shoulder, David has done his hamstring. We might have to go back into the loan market. We didn't deserve that and the referee was nothing short of appalling.

'Kevin got kicked right in front of the linesman and nothing was given. I asked the fourth official to explain it and he couldn't.

Lennon vents his frustrations to Referee Haywood following the final whistle 

'They should have changed the referee at half-time. Someone from the crownd would have been better. It was like a wrestling match and he made decisions that beggared belief.'

Clarke said he “seconded the opinion” of Lennon about the referee's overall performance but said his players weren't guilty of anything over-zealous.

'Zach Clough fell on the pitch and dislocated his shoulder. Come on, you have to be fair,' he said.

Eidur Gudjohnsen gave Bolton the lead after 60 minutes but Jamie Mackie levelled in injury-time to put Reading in good heart ahead of Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final against Bradford City.
