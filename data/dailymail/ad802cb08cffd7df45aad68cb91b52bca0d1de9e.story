Everyone remembers that scene from Only Fools and Horses where Del Boy and Rodney donned too tight Batman and Robin outfits... Well, they do in the UK at least. 

And while the rest of the world may have been baffled why two men were driving a battered old van in the middle of the Olympic Stadium, it did give the British crowd a laugh, with even the Royal attendees Prince Harry and Kate obviously amused.

In typically British humour, the classic Only Fools and Horses scene that sees Del Boy played by David Jason and Rodney played by Nicolas Lyndhurst becoming real-life crime fighters while dressed as the comic heroes for a fancy dress party was recreated with a bang in the stadium.

'You plonker!': Del Boy and Rodney's Reliant Robin - complete with the 'Trotters Independent Trading Co' written on the side - drives on to the stage with an overheating engine

Off with a bang: The battered old van then blew up as scenes from the movie The Italian Job were shown on big screens around the stadium

'You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!': The sketch was a mix of the classic British film The Italian Job and the most popular episode of the Only Fools and Horses TV show

The old bright yellow Reliant Robin was driven on to the stage before it suddenly exploded as the two characters dressed as Batman and Robin jumped out.

Michael Caine's classic 1969 film The Italian Job with the famous line: 'You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off' was shown on the big screens at the same time as 1980s pop stars Madness singing one of their most popular hits, Our House.

Echoing the song's original video, saxophonist Lee Thompson was lifted to play solo high above the track.

More than 21 million viewers watched in 1996 when the comic pair ended the 13th series of the eternally popular sitcom Only Fools and Horses based in a London tower block dressed up as the comic pair.

Even Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton couldn't help but laugh at the sketch inspired by the typically British sense of humour that made the series so popular.

Lovely jubbly: Batman and Robin then rushed off the stage to go and fight some local crime... or to get changed

Do the Mobot: The Only Fools and Horses sketch was performed along to Madness playing Our House as the lead singer Graham McPherson paid homage to Mo Farah by doing the Mobot

Having a laugh: Prince Harry and Kate Duchess of Cambridge laughing at the sketch

The funny sketch was reminiscent of the opening ceremony when the Queen filmed a sketch with James Bond actor Daniel Craig appearing to show her jumping out a helicopter and parachuting into the Olympic stadium.

One person joked on Twitter that a NBC Commentator on the Olympics told his American viewers: 'That is not actually Batman but a British folk hero known as Del Boy. Sort of like Robin Hood'.

The music then continued right through the show with a host of great British music acts and songs, including Oasis, Annie Lennox, Kaiser Chiefs, the Spice Girls and George Michael. 

But that wasn't the last comedy moment for the crowd after home-made flying machines made several attempts to get off the ground as a would-be rocket man played by Monty Python comedian Eric Idle collapsed under the stage - only to return to lead the crowds in a new version of Always Look On The Bright Side of Life.
