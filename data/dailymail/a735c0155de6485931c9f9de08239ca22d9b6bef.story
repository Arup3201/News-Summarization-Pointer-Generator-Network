If anyone questioned Jose Mourinho's deadline day capture of Juan Cuadrado then have a word with Phil Jagielka.

It was the deftest of touches midway through the first half, but it had Jagielka - a seasoned international defender - bewildered, looking round for the ball.

One second Jagielka was comfortable, goal side and touch tight with Cuadrado. But with an inconspicuous flick of his boot, the Colombian was arrowing into Everton's penalty area.

It was a breathtaking moment of skill. The sort of thing that forced Mourinho to pay an initial £23.3million rising to £27m.

And on this, his first start for the Blues, Cuadrado, for the most part, lived up to his billing.

His ovation ahead of kick-off would have made the South American feel at ease in his new home.

And had he been as vocal as those who now chant his name, Cuadrado may well have earned his new team an early penalty after his shot ricocheted onto Steven Naysmith's arm.

It looked a blatant spot kick on the replays, and perhaps with a louder appeal, referee Jonathan Moss would have pointed to the spot.

Mourinho will surely drum that into Cuadrado in the coming weeks - but on Wednesday night's evidence the Colombian doesn't need a lengthy induction into life at Chelsea.

He slotted seamlessly into Chelsea's attacking quartet - getting to grips with the fluidity of Mourinho's forward line instantly.

He started the game out on the right, but looked just as comfortable through the middle or on the left. Mourinho likes a versatile player, in Cuadrado he seems to have one.

He could easily have scored a goal and assisted another inside the opening 25 minutes such was his impact in the early stages.

His work rate caught the eye, too.

Refusing to allow Branislav Ivanovic to bear the brunt of the defensive duties down Chelsea's right, Cuadrado ensured he was on hand to lend support to his team-mate as they dealt with Naismith's threat.

Mourinho wouldn't accept anything less, though. Ask Juan Mata or Andre Schurrle.

There wasn't quite the same level of dynamism in Cuadrado's second half display. Perhaps the pace of the Premier League caught up with him.

He saw little of the ball in the second period before he was replace by Cesc Fabregas in the 69th minute.

But the facts spoke for themselves: a respectable 87.2 percent pass completion rate, two shots, three key passes and 62 touches of the football.

Perhaps this display didn't have the razzmatazz of his performances for Colombia during the World Cup.

But he showed more than enough to leave Chelsea supporters with a positive first impression.

Work-rate, versatility, pace and end product - Cuadrado is your archetypal Mourinho player.
