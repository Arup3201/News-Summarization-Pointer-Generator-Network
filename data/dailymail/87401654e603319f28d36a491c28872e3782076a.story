Joseph O'Brien has insisted he will still be riding on the Flat this season despite riding over hurdles for the first time at Limerick on Saturday.

The 21-year-old jockey rides Egyptian War, trained by his father Aidan and owned by JP McManus, in the Family Fun Day Rated Novices’ Hurdle,

At the same time, the mounts on seven runners also trained by his father at The Curragh are shared between Ryan Moore and Joseph’s apprentice jockey younger siblings Ana and Donnacha.

O’Brien, who is almost six feet tall, has admitted his time riding on the Flat is likely to be limited by weight issues.

This latest news will increase speculation that the switch of codes is near at hand.

In a statement, his father said: ‘Joseph is a little heavy at the moment but plans to be back riding on the Flat shortly. He has his first ride over hurdles on Egyptian Warrior at Limerick on Sunday after which he will travel to the Curragh to ride work after racing.’

Joseph, winner of two of the last three Derbies on Australia and Camelot, has a string of big race mounts potentially lined up for him with Gleneagles favourite for the 2,000 Guineas and JF Kennedy currently front runner of clutch of Derby possibles.

Should Joseph have to turn his back permanently on the Flat, Moore, the three-time British champion, would be favourite to take more rides for his father’s stable.

Teaforthree, the Rebecca Curtis-trained Grand National third in 2013 who got as far as The Chair last year when joint favourite last year, is out of next month’ s race.
