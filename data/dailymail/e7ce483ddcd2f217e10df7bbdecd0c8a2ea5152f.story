England's opening Group D opponents 
Italy saw their World Cup send-off party fall flat as they were held to 
an embarrassing draw by European lightweights Luxembourg at the Stadio 
Renato Curi in Perugia on Wednesday night.

Four
 years after the then world champions finished bottom of a group that 
included New Zealand, Paraguay and Slovakia, Italy take off for Rio late
 on Thursday on the back of a real upset.

England
 will take note that Cesare Prandelli had made six changes – including 
taking off key men Andrea Pirlo and Mario Balotelli – by the time 
uncharacteristically poor marking allowed Maxime Chanot to head in from a
 late corner.

Prandelli will also claim that his players are exhausted from a brutal training camp in Florence this week designed to duplicate the stifling heat of Manaus, where Italy and England will meet on June 14.

But it was still a jolt for the Italians who had been in party mood from the moment Balotelli set up an early goal for Claudio Marchisio.

‘I’m not disappointed because I knew my team had worked a lot on their physical conditioning,’ said Prandelli. ‘We have based our operation to be ready for Brazil not now. We knew we might pay the price at some point.

‘My team will be ready in Brazil. We still have to work on a few details like freekicks and corners. You could see tonight that we were not ready on those sort of things.

‘I was not very happy with my team playing too many long balls as well. We need to work on that. In Brazil we won’t have all the space like we did tonight against Luxembourg.

‘We should have scored a second goal to kill it off but we didn’t and we have to learn from that.’

Asked
 if he could take any heart from England’s draw against Ecuador in 
Miami, Prandelli replied: ‘The results before the World Cup don’t matter
 because those are friendly games and we saw that tonight. You don’t 
have to give too much significance to these results.’

The surprise 
draw also added to a difficult week for Prandelli who has been forced to
 defend his decision to pick striker Lorenzo Insigne, scorer of just 
three Serie A goals for Napoli last season, in his 23-man squad instead 
of Giuseppe Rossi and Mattia Destro.

The broken leg suffered by 
Riccardo Montolivo in Italy’s previous friendly against the Republic of 
Ireland also meant Prandelli had to experiment by partnering Andrea 
Pirlo and Marco Verratti together in central midfield for the first time, even though some argue that they are too similar in style.

Daniele
 De Rossi played the anchor role in a 4-1-4-1 formation but that isn’t 
necessarily how Italy will start against England. The media here speculated that Prandelli could use up to five different 
formations in Brazil – including a 4-1-2-1-2 or a three-man defence – 
and he was able to tinker with his line-up in the second half.

They 
should have been further ahead before Luxembourg’s late equaliser with 
Balotelli in particular guilty of several misses, including hitting the 
bar from 15 yards.

Prandelli defended the former Manchester City 
striker saying: ‘Balotelli played very well. Even though he didn’t score
 he created some opportunities.’

You suspect the Italy boss will not be so forgiving in nine days’ time however.
