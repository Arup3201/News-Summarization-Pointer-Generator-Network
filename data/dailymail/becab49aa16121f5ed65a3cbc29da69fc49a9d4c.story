Bayern Munich survived an early scare to open up an 11-point lead in the Bundesliga with a 3-1 victory over struggling Hannover at the HDI Arena.

The hosts took a surprise lead through Japan international Hiroshi Kiyotake after a lapse in concentration from Bayern Munich defender Dante at the back.

However, the champions equalised within the space of three minutes when former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso curled in a stunning free-kick.

Thomas Muller scored  from the penalty spot after substitute Robert Lewandowski was kicked in the face before adding a second with brilliant header from Franck Ribery's cross.

With Wolfsburg losing 1-0 to Augsburg, few people would bet against Bayern retaining their league title.
