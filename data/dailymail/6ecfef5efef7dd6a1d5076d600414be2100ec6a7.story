The Russian feminist band Pussy Riot have refused to repent for performing an anti-Vladamir Putin 'punk prayer' in Moscow's main cathedral as their appeal hearing was postponed until next week.

The three band members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, Maria
Alyokhina, 24, and Ekaterina Samutsevich, 30, - were convicted of 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred' and jailed for two years by a district court on Aug 17.

Their appeal hearing which began today, was postponed until October 
10 after Samutsevich fired her attorney meaning she was left without legal 
representation.

Jailed: The Russian punk band Pussy Riot refused to repent for performing a 'punk prayer' against President Vladimir Putin at Moscow's main cathedral as their appeal hearing was postponed until next week

The Russian orthodox Church said they should be pardoned on the condition they repented for 'desecrating a holy place'.

Fights broke out between Pussy Riot supporters and pro-Church activists as around 150 people gathered outside the Moscow courthouse for the start of the appeal hearing today.

The tough jail sentences they received saw the West sharply criticise Putin and the Kremlin because of doubts over the independence of the judiciary, and global celebrities, including British musician Paul McCartney and U.S. pop singer Madonna, called for leniency for the women.

Vladimir Legoida, a senior church spokesman, said their stunt 'must not remain unpunished whatever the justification,' but said that any repentance, if expressed, should be taken into account.

'The church sincerely wishes for the repentance of those who desecrated a holy place, certainly it would benefit their souls,' Legoida said in a speech.

'If any words of the convicts indicate repentance ... we would wish that they are not left unnoticed and those who violated the law get a chance to mend their ways.'

'If they (the church) mean repentance in the sense of a crime ... it definitely won't happen. Our clients won't admit guilt. A call for that is pointless,' lawyer Mark Feigin told independent television channel Dozhd on Sunday.

A recent official opinion poll showed 
that more than half of Russians are critical of what Pussy Riot did and 
consider their two-year jail sentence to be a just one, with less than a
third saying the opposite.

The trio's legal team and relatives hold out little hope that the sentences - which they believe are excessively harsh - will be quashed or reduced at the hearing scheduled for Monday, whether they repent or not.

'The sentence is predetermined; their repentance will not affect it in any way,' Stanislav Samutsevich, father of one of the jailed women, told Reuters.

'The fact the church is calling for that is nothing but a public relations move to sustain their reputation in the eyes of the public, as the church says it is separate from the state.'

Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has called Putin's 12-year rule a 'miracle of God' and backed his presidential election campaign earlier this year.

Kirill dismissed criticism of his backing for the Kremlin on Friday, telling students that close ties between the church and state helped protect and develop society.
