A Nigerian woman filed for divorce from her husband because his penis was too big, according to media reports.

Aisha Dannupawa, a housewife and mother-of-three, asked for her marriage to husband Ali Maizinari to be dissolved due to his large manhood.

Their divorce was granted after just one week of marriage in a Islamic Sharia court in Nigeria's Zamfara State.

Decision: The court in Zamfara State, Nigeria, granted the divorce. It was the first state in the country to introduce Sharia law

She told the court she had married Maizinari after her first marriage failed.

As part of the local tradition, before settling into her husband's home the bride was invited to move into his parents' house. 

But it was only when the couple first had sex she claimed that the trauma began.

'When he came, we had sex but the experience was a nightmare. Instead of enjoying the sex, it turned out to be something else, because his penis was too big,' she told the court, according to Nigeria's Tribune.

After their first unsuccessful attempt at making love, she took medication given to her by her mother.

'I told my mother the experience but she told me to endure and that with time, I will be able to cope. She then gave me some drugs,' she said to Nigerian media.

According to Dannupawa, the couple had sex again but it was 'too much to bear' and the couple concluded that no drug could help their sex life or their marriage.

Maizinari did not deny the accusation and told the court he was willing to dissolve the union if his dowry and money spent during the courtship was paid back.

The state of Zamfara is in the north-west of the country and is approximately 500 miles away from Lagos, Nigeria's capital. It was the first state to introduce Islamic law. 

The average length of an erect penis is 5.2 inches (13.12 cm), according to a report released yesterday.

Length: Experts plotted graphs showing the size distribution of the length of the average penis when flaccid, flaccid and stretched and erect. The graph above shows average penis length of men - in centimetres - in each percentile

Tthe average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches (9.16 cm) and 5.2 inches (13.24 cm) when flaccid but stretched.

And when it comes to girth, the average erect circumference was 4.6 inches (11.66 cm) and 3.7 inches (9.31 cm) when flaccid.

The British research also found there was a small correlation between the erect length of a penis and a man's height.

Girth: The researchers also plotted a nomogram showing the size distribution of the girth of the average penis. The graph shows the average penis girth of men in each percentile - again in centimetres
