Prince Harry in Afghanistan in 2012: The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC) - the prince's unit - is embarking on a final Afghanistan tour under strength

Prince Harry could be asked to return to frontline duty in Afghanistan due to a shortage of crew to fly Apache helicopters, according to Defence sources.

The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC) – the regiment Harry joined from the Household Cavalry to fly Apaches – is embarking on a final tour of Afghanistan as the AAC  faces a 40 per cent shortage of senior air crew.

Defence sources say Harry, 29, has volunteered to fly again should 3 Regiment AAC be in danger of going to war under-strength.

The Palace refused to comment but a source close to Harry denied this was the case.

The Prince, who started a desk job in London in January arranging ceremonial events,  remains qualified as an Apache pilot, having flown sorties against the Taliban in 2012-2013.

He would need only to attend a brief refresher course before being sent back to Camp Bastion for a 12-week stint.

Meanwhile, other shortages in the Armed Forces have triggered a rise in ‘Golden Hello’ one-off payments for personnel to stay in service.

On top of their salaries, military nurses are being offered £20,000 and weapons engineers aboard submarines £50,000 to sign-on for an extra five years.

This rise comes as a report by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body found that some privates in the Army fighting in Afghanistan are earning less than the National Minimum Wage (NMW).

Troops’ pay starts at £17,767 a year and long working hours means they may earn less than the £6.31 an hour NMW for those over 21 and £5.03 an hour for those over 18.

The report says: ‘It is possible for those on the lowest pay level to be earning below NMW levels if they work over 55 hours per week, for those aged 21 or over, or more than 68 hours per week if they are aged between 18 and 20.

'As the average number of hours worked is much higher for those personnel on overseas operations or at sea, the more time someone spends in these locations the greater the chance of breaching NMW thresholds.’

Crucial tool: An Apache helicopter on a rescue mission in Afghanistan. Harry remains qualified as an Apache pilot. He would need only a brief refresher course before being sent back to Camp Bastion for a 12-week stint

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We have worked hard to ensure that the sacrifices and dedication of our personnel is recognised, which is why they have continued to receive pay rises and also qualify for other benefits including subsidised accommodation, generous non-contributory pensions and substantial periods of paid leave.

'It is therefore entirely misleading to suggest that personnel earn less than the minimum wage.

On the Golden Hello payments, he added: ‘As is common practice among commercial organisations, we use financial retention incentives to ensure we retain essential skills and experience within the Armed Forces.’
