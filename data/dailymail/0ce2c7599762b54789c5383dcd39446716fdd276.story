Today is the busiest day for buying Christmas trees, with between six and eight million sold every year

Between six and eight million Christmas trees are sold in Britain every year — and today is the busiest day for buying them. But how many of us know which type of fir will best suit our needs or even that there are distinct types?

Here Steve Guy, the national Christmas tree expert at Dobbies Garden Centres, explains how to choose, cherish and care for your perfect tree ...

1. CHOOSE CAREFULLY

There are four main types sold in the UK and each has different merits. The Nordmann fir has a glossy green colour and big needles which are lovely and soft, making it suitable for those with young children.

It’s more expensive than the Norway spruce, which has that classic rich, fresh Christmas fragrance and a very structured pyramid shape.

These are inexpensive but their needles are sharper and tend to fall off, and its sap is very sticky — it won’t mess up your house, but you’ll get it on your hands while lugging it home, so watch your clothing.

The two less popular options are the Fraser fir and the Noble fir. The Fraser has a blue-green colour and is a narrower tree, so ideal if you have less space. It has dense foliage, so not ideal for bauble lovers, but lovely if you just want tinsel and lights. The Noble fir is thick stemmed, which can make it a struggle if you’re using a tree stand, but it has better spaced foliage.

2. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR

With a Christmas tree, price does tend to indicate quality. The more expensive ones are more likely to have been hand-trimmed before being cut down or dug up, so are in a good shape.

Judge by looking carefully before you buy — trees are like cats and dogs, you can tell if they’re healthy by the sheen of their coat.

Ideally, the tree should be a shiny, glossy green. I recommend taking the tree by the trunk and tapping it on the ground. Evergreens lose needles all year round, but if too many fall off you might want to reconsider.

3. BEWARE THE TAG

Although tree size goes up in feet, sellers are allowed 15 cm (6 in) either side — so a 6 ft tree (the most popular height) could be a little taller or shorter.

This means it’s vital to know both the exact height of the room you’re putting it in — especially if you want one which grazes the ceiling — and to measure the tree, too. Remember the tree stand will add up to 15 cm. All is not lost if you get the height wrong, though. Just trim the trunk and take off some lower branches.

4. WATCH THE WRAPPING

A ready-wrapped tree might seem helpful — but don’t buy these. It’s vital to look at the tree’s shape out of the netting, in case it’s wider than you want or an uneven shape.

Without seeing it unwrapped, you don’t know what you’re getting. Any respectable seller will unwrap and rewrap the tree for no extra charge.

Wear gardening gloves to handle it and be careful of the tip, which can be damaged easily. Make sure any tree is wrapped before you take it home.

5. TREAT IT LIKE CUT FLOWERS

Once home, cut 2 cm or 3 cm from the stump straight across using a handsaw. It’s easier than you think, and helps the tree take up moisture, like trimming cut flowers.

Then place it in a tree stand that holds water and generously water the tree every day. It can drink two litres daily, depending on room temperature. Unlike cut flowers, don’t add sugar.

If you want a live tree to plant afterwards, choose a pot-grown version as these have a better chance of living, since the roots are whole. All Christmas trees are grown from seeds not cuttings.

Vitally, whichever type you buy, do not unwrap the tree until it’s secure, otherwise you’ll be fighting branches and foliage. Then leave it to stand for 24 hours before decorating so the branches settle down.

6. KEEP IT COOL

Putting a tree close to a stove or radiator will dry it out. A Nordmann fir will lose its sheen and a Norway spruce will lose its needles. Obviously, keep well away from candles, as it can easily catch fire.

7. AFTER CHRISTMAS

Many councils will collect trees for you or you can take it to a recycling centre. Alternatively, chop it up and use as a rich scented mulch for the garden. They don’t make good firewood; their sap will take a year to dry out properly. If you have bought a pot-grown tree, plant it at the back of the garden, as they grow extremely high.
