A pimp charged City workers up to £510 an hour for cocaine-fuelled sex with Eastern European prostitutes, a court heard today.

Sorient Sigba allegedly sent chauffeurs to City strip clubs to ferry revellers to the mews house in central London where they would pay hundreds for sex and drugs.

Prosecutors say the brothel took in £1million a year before it was shut down by police who targeted it in an undercover sting.

When men arrived at the house, they were met by scantily clad prostitutes reclining on leather sofas before being taken into one of three bedrooms, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The wealthy customers were allegedly charged £300 an hour if they paid cash, or £390 by card, with wraps of cocaine provided for £60.

Sigba, 54, is alleged to be one of three men who ran the sex den in Holborn and split the profits between them.

'We say that Sorient Sigba was, to use the vernacular, the pimp,' prosecutor Christiaan Moll told the court.

'He was in charge of hiring, firing and paying the girls, and Freddy was the name that the defendant was known by at the establishment.'

Simon Earl has already pleaded guilty to managing the brothel, while Michael Wallen has admitted laundering £946,776 of profit between January and October 2011.

Brothel madam Vera Fosuhene, 46, pleaded guilty to managing a brothel and supplying cocaine. All three will be sentenced at the conclusion of Sigba's trial.

Mr Moll said an email to Sigba found at Earl and Wallen's Greenwich office read: 'Freddy, drivers' names mean nothing to me, that is what you are supposed to be doing.

'Simon deals with the flat and cards, I deal with the figures and you deal with the girls and the drivers.'

But the prosecutor told jurors: 'Just because Earl, Wallen and Fosuhene have pleaded guilty does not mean that this defendant Mr Sigba is guilty.

'What it does mean is that there was a conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, and a conspiracy to transfer criminal property, and there was a brothel where drugs were sold.

'The question for you to consider is whether this defendant was knowingly playing a part in this enterprise.'

The court heard the brothel was targeted as part of a police operation aimed at smashing London vice rings.

Undercover officers visited the property on three occasions after being approached by mini-cab drivers outside the City Burlesque club in Farringdon.

Mr Moll said that during the first visit in July 2011 the door to the brothel was opened by Fosuhene.

'Inside the lounge there were five scantily clad girls of eastern European origin aged approximately 20 to 25 years old,' said the barrister.

'Angelina asked the officer how long he wanted, and when he stated he wanted an hour she told him it would cost £300.'

During a second visit in October 2011 a Jaguar, later found to be registered to Sigba, was parked outside the property and Sigba opened the door to the brothel, Mr Moll said.

The officer apparently asked if he could buy two wraps of cocaine, and was charged £120 for the drugs.

Police raided the brothel later that day and discovered envelopes stuffed with cash, worksheets, a letter addressed to Earl, and a sex toy.

When officers arrested Sigba at his office they found a hire purchase agreement for a Jaguar seen outside the brothel, and worksheets identical to those found there.

Mr Moll said: 'That links him in, we say, with what was happening at the brothel.'

When they searched his home address they discovered paperwork relating to a two-bed property in Mayfair and a bag of sex toys.

Sigba, of Barnehurst in Kent, denies conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and conspiracy to transfer criminal property.

The trial continues.
