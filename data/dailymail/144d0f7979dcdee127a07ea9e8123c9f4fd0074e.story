Wayne Rooney has been voted England player of the year after topping a poll of Three Lions fans.

Although he failed to inspire England to success at the World Cup, 2014 was a momentous year for Rooney individually.

The 29-year-old scored eight goals in 13 appearances and was named England captain following Steven Gerrard's retirement from international football.

1. Wayne Rooney - 27 per cent 

2. Danny Welbeck - 11 per cent 

3. Raheem Sterling - Seven per cent 

The Manchester United skipper also earned his 100th cap and moved to within three goals of Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time scoring record.

Rooney took 27 per cent of the votes from an online poll of supporters club members, more than second-placed Danny Welbeck (11 per cent) and third-placed Raheem Sterling (seven per cent) combined. It is the third time he has won the award.

Rooney told the FA's website: 'I'm both very happy and proud to be named the England fans' player of the year.

'The fact that this award is chosen by the fans makes it even more special, so I would like to thank all those who voted. I would also like to thank all the England fans for their support throughout what was a mixed year.

Arsenal striker and former team-mate of Rooney Danny Welbeck came second in the poll

Raheem Sterling, who was arguably England's best player at the World Cup in Brazil, came third in the poll

'Receiving an honour such as this from the fans is always something that fills you with personal pride.

'But it is important to point out that without the support of my team-mates, coaching and backroom staff such an award would not be possible. I therefore accept this from the fans on behalf of every single member of the England team.'

Manchester City's Toni Duggan claimed the women's player of the year award.

Saido Berahino won Under-21 player of the year while Dominic Solanke and Leah Williamson took him the respective men's and women's youth player awards.
