Russian scientists are claiming palm readers may have been onto something when trying to predict the future.

A group of university professors recently unveiled a scanner they believe can detect the perfect job for anyone - simply by looking at their fingerprints.

While the science remains in contention, the group claim that in the future, fingerprints could help reveal key personality traits.

The new biometric test was used at a careers convention in Krasnodar, a city in southwestern Russia.

To use the scanner, people place their fingers upon the fingerprint reader and computer technology linked up to sensors reads back what sort of work would suit the individual.

The device bases its results on a database of how fingerprint shapes correlate to job selection.

This database was created using a variety of previous employment studies.

Local employers linked up with researchers from the city's Kuban University of Physical Education and Sport to road test the technology.

Twenty one-year-old Oscar Galkin, a mathematics graduate, said: 'I got the feedback that I would be suited to a job in IT - which is exactly what I want to do.

While the science remains in contention, the group claim that in the future, fingerprints could help reveal key personality traits. Zara Tokareva, who faints at the sight of blood, said: 'I want to be an interior designer but the machine said I should be a nurse so, no, I don't think it is as clever as is being made out'

Fingerprint identification, known as 
dactyloscopy, or hand print identification, is the process of comparing 
two instances of friction ridge skin impressions from human fingers.

People place their fingers upon the 
fingerprint reader and computer technology linked up to sensors reads 
back what sort of work would suit the individual.

It bases its results on a database of how fingerprint shapes correlates to job selection. Despite
 its widespread use in crime detection, it is still a science that has a
 lot of potential, say experts, from detecting drug abuse to personality
 analysis - exactly as palm readers have been claiming to do for 
centuries.

‘I don't know if it is luck or if it can really read a person's ambitions and talents, but it worked for me.'

And Zara Tokareva, aged 20, who faints at the sight of blood, adeded: 'I want to be an interior designer but the machine said I should be a nurse so, no, I don't think it is as clever as is being made out.'

'The basic concept is that although everybody's fingerprints are completely unique, there are obvious characteristics that were common on the fingers of certain professionals working in certain jobs,’ said researcher Ravil Yudin.

‘It's not really a new concept because palm readers have been saying for hundreds of years that you can predict a person's future by reading their palm.

‘We want to match that by looking at fingerprints and trying to predict what career path people would choose.

‘In a way it's also kind of like predicting the future, and we are now testing it out by trying to give people advice on what their fingerprints say is in store for them.'

While Russian scientists are focusing on finding a link between fingerprints and personality, the idea that the shape of hands indicates different traits has long been studied by researchers.

For instance, scientists have noticed an extraordinary link between the ratio of two digits on the hand — the ring and index fingers, known in scientists’ jargon as 2D and 4D — and a whole host of seemingly unrelated traits.

Evidence is growing that this ‘digit ratio’, especially when applied to the right hand, is a fundamental indicator of sexuality, aggression and ­diseases suffered by men.

A number of years ago evidence emerged of a link between the ‘2D:4D finger ratio’ and a man’s likelihood of developing prostate cancer.

Specifically, men whose index fingers are longer than their ring fingers were significantly less likely to develop the disease, according to scientists at the Institute Of Cancer Research.

A long index finger also correlates strongly with a lower risk of early heart disease and, in women, a higher risk of breast cancer and greater fertility.

People with relatively long index fingers are also more likely to suffer from schizophrenia, allergies, eczema and hay fever.

Young boys are more likely to be clingy and anxious than their low-ratio peers but also, ultimately, less attention-seeking and better behaved in school, research claims.
