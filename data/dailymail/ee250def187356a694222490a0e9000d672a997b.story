After years of dominating the burger industry, McDonald’s is now facing tough competition from upmarket rivals.

Young foodies are increasingly seeking out boutique burger bars with top quality ingredients and table service.

The explosion of trendy burger joints, including Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Byron Burger and Honest Burger, has put McDonald’s under pressure.

Now, the US giant has launched a gourmet cafe in Australia to see if it can upgrade its image.

Known as The Corner, its new Sydney cafes have ditched the counter service and plastic feel for table service, metal baskets and wooden trays.

It has also launched a separate phone app in America which allows customers to pick which bread, cheese, toppings and sauce they want before the burger is made to order.

But critics suggest McDonald’s could struggle to fend off the rise of posh burger restaurants, which are rapidly expanding worldwide.

In London, customers queue down the street to eat at fashionable eateries such as Dirty Burger, Meatliquor and Patty & Bun, where the meals are served in paper.

Far from serving processed meat and cheese, they all emphasise the high-end cooking and staunchly target Britain’s middle-classes.

Byron Burger says it makes ‘proper hamburgers’ with ‘good Scottish beef, ground fresh, cooked medium and served in a squishy bun with fries and a craft beer’.

In the US, a rival brand called Shake Shack describes itself as ‘fine casual’ and says it makes ‘premium burgers’.

McDonald’s, in contrast, was said to be regarded as ‘unhealthy, outdated, downmarket and not a nice place to be’ by Britain’s young food-lovers.

The Financial Times said: ‘McDonald’s has a grip on the mass market but is losing the top.’

McDonald’s is trying to adapt. It recently opened a McCafe known as The Corner, in Sydney’s suburbs, although it is not believed to sell burgers.

The experimental café serves chipotle pulled pork, chorizo and egg rolls, museli pots, Moroccan chicken salad and tofu.

They will also sell ‘barista-made quality coffee, according to Business Insider, in a bid to satisfy Australia’s high standards for coffee and its café culture.

The only giveaway that it is owned by McDonald’s are small logos on staff name badges and packaging.

McDonald’s said it would use the trial café as a test for a healthier menu before possible rolling it out nationwide.

Kyle Jarvis, manager of The Corner, said: ‘If they’re looking for a Quarter Pounder they’ll probably be sorely disappointed.

‘It’s a new concept for us, it’s a learning lab where we test the things that Maccas has never done before and push the boundaries of what we can do in a cafe environment.’

McDonald’s also revealed this week that it would cut several items from its massive menu next month in the US in a bid to speed up service.

McDonald’s US President Mike Andres said: ‘We don’t need to have a big menu board to offer variety.’
