'Madame': Carmen Fluker, 42, was arrested last month after a raid on her Ferguson, Missouri, bungalow where police say they discovered a stripper poll, a fully stocked bar and a VIP room

A one-time aspiring singer from Missouri has been accused of running a brothel and strip club out of her suburban home - with her own teenage son acting as a bartender.

Carmen Fluker, 42, was arrested last month after a raid on her Ferguson bungalow where police say they discovered a stripper poll, a fully stocked bar and a VIP room.

Officers who descended on Fluker's humble brick house in the 400 block of Warfield Avenue seized alcohol, condoms and cash.

Police say they also found a teenage girl working as a dancer.

The operation resulted in Fluker being indicted last week on a single felony count of promoting prostitution between May 2011 and April 2014.

The 42-year-old woman, who also goes by the monickers Carmen Lacy, Carmen Simmons, Luscious and her former stage name, Araye, told St Louis Post-Dispatch Tuesday that she had been 'set up.'

According to a search warrant, police got a tip in March saying that Mrs Fluker was hosting alcohol- and drug-fueled parties with strippers every night at her home where her son's room was allegedly being used for lap dances and sex. 

The informant told police that whenever Fluker was planning an event, she would send messages inviting prospective customers.

The unnamed tipster paid two visits to Flukers' alleged sex den and recorder the goings on inside on a hidden video camera.

The April arrest was was not Fluker's first run-in with the law.

In 2011, her previous residence in Bel-Ridge was raided by police. Detective Michael Slaughter wrote in a warrant at the time that the woman and her then-husband were running the Yes We Can Social Club hosting nude dancers and alcohol.

Den of sin: Police acting on a tip from an informant raided Fluker's brick home on Warfield Avenue, where they found naked women and her teenage son manning the bar

On her Twitter page, which has been dormant since last June, Fluker would promote her establishment, writing about drink specials, 'Bad Girlz live entertainers,' and even exchanging a few messages with rapper Nicki Minaj.

Before the 2011 raid on Fluker's home, two informants attended one of her soirees and reported seeing naked women and a 10-year-old boy, presumably the suspected madame’s son, cooking food and manning the bar.

In August of that year, police officers arrested 30 people in Fluker's home, but neither she nor her husband was charged. 

Speaking to Fox2Now after her 2011 arrest, Fluker claimed that she was having a bachelorette party when officers barged in with their guns drawn, but found no evidence of prostitution or drug use. 

The woman also contended that Yes We Can Social Club was an entertainment charity she had started in January 2011 to help needy families.

On Monday, the 42-year-old woman said in court that she was unemployed and living off food stamps and disability payments.

An Internet search has revealed that back in 2008, Fluker was trying to build a career as a singer, performing under the name Araye in honor of her late daughter.

In a biography posted on the site Showcase Your Music, Fluker-Araye wrote of herself that she has 'an energetically powerful voice' and ‘a relentless determinations [sic] to succeed as an International entertainer.'

According Araye's profile, she began performing live with her father's band at age 12, singing Aretha Franklin and Gladys Knight classics.

The self-described 'multi-talented songstress' went on to release a CD called 'My Life' before getting an associate degree in social work.

If convicted, Fluker could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
