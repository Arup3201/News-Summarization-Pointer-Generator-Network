Nevermind dressing Kate Middleton for her wedding to Prince William, the bridal gown all the designers wanted to create was that of Miss Piggy when she tied the knot to the love of her life, Kermit the Frog.

And the honour went to Dame Vivienne Westwood who created the character's priceless ivory court gown which she wore in the film Muppets Most Wanted.

Now the dress, which includes a corset decorated with paillettes made from recycled plastic bottles and is accessorised with an ivory tulle veil, is going on display in London.

Here comes the bride: Miss Piggy in the Vivienne Westwood designed dress

Work of art: The ivory couture wedding gown is now on display in London

The ivory couture wedding gown and sparkly silver shoes were unveiled today in the HMV store in Oxford Street, London, to coincide with the DVD of the film going on sale.

Miss Piggy is seen wearing the dress in the Disney movie when she walks down the aisle at the Tower of London.

Miss Piggy said: 'For my starring role in my fabulous new film, Muppets Most Wanted, moi wears a Long Ivory Court wedding gown.

Muppet memorabilia: The dress will be in London's Oxford Street HMV store window for one week only

Fit for a pig: The sparkly shoes worn by Miss Piggy are also on display

'All moi's outfits are fantastique, 
but my special favourite is this glorious gown designed exclusively for 
moi by my close personal friend and fellow fashion icon, Dame Vivienne 
Westwood.'

Fans can see the dress, inspired by the court of King Charles II, in HMV's shop window for one week only.

Passers-by expressed their jealousy that Miss Piggy owned a Vivienne Westwood dress.

Rachael King, 21, currently studying 
at London College of Fashion, said: 'Miss Piggy's couture Vivienne 
Westwood wedding gown is exquisite.

'It's incredible to get the 
opportunity to see the dress up-close and witness the talent of one of 
Britain's most highly regarded designers.

'A dress like this is priceless - a couture wedding gown designed by Vivienne Westwood is every girl's dream.'

Dame Westwood spoke of her inspiration for Miss Piggy dress in the March edition of U.S. Harper's Bazaar.

She said: 'The dress is one of my favourite styles. It's called the Court dress and is inspired by 17th Century English royalty and the court of King Charles II.

'It has been designed especially... in a white pearl sequin fabric made from recycled water bottles. It's the perfect choice for a royal sow.'

Muppets Most Wanted grossed over 46 million pounds at the Box Office when it was released in March this year.

It stars Tina Fey and Ricky Gervais and features characters from The Muppets on a mayhem-filled grand tour of Europe.

Simon Winter, Senior Live Events Manager at HMV, said: 'We're huge fans of the Muppets here at HMV.

'What better way to celebrate their latest release than actually having Miss Piggy's couture wedding gown from the film on display in store.'
