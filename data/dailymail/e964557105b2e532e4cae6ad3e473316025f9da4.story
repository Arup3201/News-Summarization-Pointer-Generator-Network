A family has made a miraculous escape after their car was crushed by an eight-tonne digger.

Julie Pease was driving her nephew, her friend and two children to the seaside when the huge vehicle pulled up beside their Audi A3, and its bucket suddenly smashed into the roof.

Nobody was injured in the crash in Goole, Yorkshire, but the powerful machine crumpled the car's body work and smashed the windows.

Damage: The windows were smashed and the roof crushed by the impact

Exit: The Volvo digger that hit the car was driven away after the accident

Ms Pease, 21, was driving her friend Natasha Katona, her nephew Jaxston, three, to Blackpool on Friday afternoon.

Ms Katona's two children Cameron, seven and Kiaron, four, were also in the car ahead of the weekend trip, when the digger pulled up nearby.

The bucket started descending and, despite Ms Pease repeatedly sounding her horn, continued to crush the roof, which narrowly missed hitting Kiaron on the head.

Everybody 
in the car was able to escape out of the undamaged side, but police 
later said that had the boys been fully grown one of them could have 
been badly hurt.

Crumpled: The roof of the car was crushed by the digger's bucket

Smash: The glass in the windows was also broken by the impact

Ms Pease said: 'It was an awful experience. I knew what was happening and I saw the bucket coming down - the driver was an absolute maniac.

'I started beeping my horn but the driver couldn't have heard me.

'The bucket started to crush the car and it came down very close to Kiaron.

'The police officer told me that had he been a teenager, it could have been a very different story.'

'In shock': Ms Pease, pictured with her car, said she is just happy nobody was hurt

Battered: However, the crash left her car in serious need of repair

Response: Humberside police closed the road for an hour after the crash to investigate

'Natasha and I got out of the car through my side, as she couldn't get out through her door, and we managed to pull out the kids.

'It was absolutely terrifying. We are still in shock. The children seem fine now but we have been told to keep an eye on them as the shock can hit at any time.

'I loved my car but I don't really care about that now. I'm just so grateful everyone is safe.'

The digger belonged to NW Trading but the company owners declined to comment.

The road was closed for about an hour while the vehicles were removed and Humberside Police officers investigated the scene.
