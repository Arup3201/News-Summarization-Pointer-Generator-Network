Ex-wrestler Mark Schultz has attacked Bennett Miller, director of the movie 'Foxcatcher,' for the way he is portrayed in the movie, which shows his and his murdered brother Dave's relationship with millionaire John du Pont.

A furious Schultz called Miller 'scum' and claimed to hate him in a series of tweets posted on Wednesday - angry that the film suggests he and convicted murderer du Pont may have had a love affair.

The angry former wrestler's  comments come as a U-turn from previous enthusiastic public statements of support for the movie which is expected to feature strongly among contenders for the upcoming Academy Awards.

Schultz took to Twitter to rant and rave about Miller on Wednesday. Most of the tweets were written in all capital letters. The tweets have since been deleted, though they were seen and reprinted by Entertainment Weekly.

Schultz wrote 'YOU CROSSED THE LINE MILLER. WE'RE DONE. YOU'RE CAREER IS OVER. YOU THINK I CAN'T DO IT. WATCH ME.'

'YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SIT BACK AND WATCH YOU DESTROY MY NAME AND REPUTATION I SWEAT BLOOD FOR. YOU AINT' SEEN NOTHING YET DUDE.'

'I BUILT THIS HOUSE AND I'LL TEAR IT DOWN. YOU THINK I CAN'T TAKE YOU DOWN COZ UR A DIRECTOR. WATCH ME BENNETT'

'I CAN TOLERATE A LOT OF THINGS BUT I DON'T TOLERATE DISRESPECT. WE'RE DONE BENNETT.

'Everything I've ever said positive about the movie I take back. I hate it. i hate it. i hate it. I hate it. i hate it. i hate it. I hate it.'

'I HATE BENNETT MILLER.'

'I HATE EVERYTHING THAT SCUM TOUCHES. EVERYTHING!!!'

Killer: John du Pont, seen in a 1992 file photo, was convicted of third-degree murder and died behind bars in 2010

'Foxcatcher' also depicts the real life 1996 murder of Schultz' brother and fellow wrestler Dave Schultz, who is played by Mark Ruffalo. Channing Tatum portrays Mark Schultz.

The Olympian brothers'  benefactor John du Pont - portrayed by Steve Carell in the film - was convicted of third-degree murder and died behind bars in 2010.

Mark Schultz earlier praised 'Foxcatcher' in a November interview with MailOnline.

'It's a beautiful movie,' he said at the time. 'The last time I saw it, I kind of let the past go. The movie is not based on my book – it's based on the darkest parts of my life story.'

Indeed, Entertainment Weekly also made the point that Schultz said his representation on the big screen was inaccurate with the December 21 tweet '#Foxcatcher couldn't have portrayed me more inaccurately if they tried.'

Shooting: The movie is based on the real life 1996 murder of Dave Schultz, seen in this file photo with John du Pont 

However, that same day he tweeted ''Wrestling is extremely hard. It's the hardest sport,' said 'Foxcatcher' director Bennett Miller. How can you not love Bennett Miller.' 

Schultz also posted a lengthy message on his Facebook page on Tuesday, in which he described his anger over a 'Foxcatcher' scene that suggested he and du Pont were engaged in a sexual relationship, EW noted.

'The personalities and relationships between the characters in the film are primarily fiction and somewhat insulting,' Schultz wrote on Facebook. 'Leaving the audience with a feeling that somehow there could have been a sexual relationship between duPont and I is a sickening and insulting lie.

'I told Bennett Miller to cut that scene out and he said it was to give the audience the feeling that duPont was encroaching on your privacy and personal space. I wasn't explicit so I didn't have a problem with it. Then after reading 3 or 4 reviews interpreting it sexually, and jeopardizing my legacy, they need to have a press conference to clear the air, or I will.'

On Thursday, Schultz posted a link on his Twitter account to a Facebook post for the page 'Mark Schultz: Olympic Wrestling Champion'.

'My story and my life are real,' the post said. 'I am a real human being. While I may have tweeted out of anger, I in no way regret standing up for myself, nor do I regret calling out the only other man who has had decision making power concerning my image and legacy these past years.

'I apologize for the harshness of my language, but I am firm in where I stand. I will gladly go to any lengths to protect and safeguard the integrity and truth of my story, my life, my character and my legacy. If that's not worth fighting over while I'm still alive, I don't know what is.'

Representatives for Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Publicists for the film at Sony Pictures Classics also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
