A domestic blockbuster between Kell Brook and Amir Khan at Wembley could be announced within the next month.

Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn is deep in negotiations between the two parties over a May fight, with Wembley having already expressed their desire to stage the fight on the back of Carl Froch’s huge rematch against George Groves in May.

Hearn, writing in his MailOnline column, said: ‘Talks are ongoing over a fight between Kell Brook and Amir Khan. It is going well because I think everyone realises it makes sense.

'Khan obviously wants a fight with Floyd Mayweather, as does everyone in the division, but he knows that while that fight might never happen, even if it did he would make more money fighting Kell.

‘Everything so far has been very straightforward and I am in talks with Wembley over a May date. They want us back there as soon as possible after the success of Froch-Groves – I have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again. I hope to have this tied up in the next month or so.’

Hearn failed with a previous £3m offer to Khan to fight Brook, but the Sheffield fighter has become a far more attractive opponent to Khan since winning the IBF welterweight world title against Shawn Porter last month.

Brook will return to the ring in a homecoming fight in Sheffield on December 6.
