Stretching out into the still blue lagoon waters, set against a backdrop of rugged mountains, these are the spectacular first images of how Rio de Janeiro's Olympic park will look in 2016.

Designs for the complex in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of the city have been revealed by the architects that won the contract to mastermind the project in London.

The waterfront park will be built on the former Brazilian grand prix track in a striking triangular layout spread over 300 acres.

Lighting up the world: Rio de Janeiro's Olympic Park will be located next to the water's edge in the Barra area of the the city. The park will be built on the
former Brazilian grand prix track in a striking triangular layout 
spread over 300 acres

Stunning site: The Olympic Park will host 15 Olympic sports and a 11 Paralympic competitions at 34 venues. Notable venues shown here are: 4. The Aquatics centre (top centre), 6. The hockey fields (centre of the plan) 7. TheÂ  Velodrome (blue centre field), 14. Gymnatics (top right), 8,9,10. Main tennis arenas (bottom centre)

It will play host to 15 Olympic sports including swimming and hockey and a further 11 Paralympic competitions in 34 venues on the site, 18 of which are already operating.

It will also house a media centre to accommodate 20,000 journalists and the Olympic and Paralympic villages are also located in the Barra zone.

Unlike the London Games, the main Olympic stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous Brazil football stadium, the Maracana, which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the Joco Havelange Stadium - home to the club side Botafogo.

Building work is well underway with the project said to be more straightforward than London because several venues are already on the site due to its former role in hosting the Pan American Games.

Visionary: Bill Hanway, 51, who headed up International Architects Studio Aecom's bid 
to win the design contract, looks over the plan. Building work underway with the 
project said to be more straightforward than London because several 
venues are already on the site due to its former role in hosting the Pan
American Games

Flowing design: Cutting through the centre of the park is the Olympic Way which reflects the design of pavements across Brazil which show the merging of the darker waters of the Rio (river) Negro and the lighter waters of the Rio Solomons in the Amazon

Big project: Mr Hanway looks over his designs. Unlike the London Games, the main Olympic
stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous Brazil 
football stadium, the Maracana, which will also be the site of the 
opening and closing ceremonies as well as the Joco Havelange Stadium -

International Architects Studio 
Aecom, based in Holborn, London, were also responsible for designing 
London's much-heralded Olympic park in Stratford.

Bill
Hanway, 51, who led Aecom's Rio bid to win the contract said: 'It is 
very exciting. It will show off the best of Brazilian architecture in a 
magnificent setting.

'This 
is the first Olympics in South America and Rio is the most beautiful 
city in the world and we have tried to reflect the beauty and spirit of 
the place in our masterplan.'

Explaining
how it will differ from the London park, Hanway added: 'London was very
complex because of the old industry and network of canals. Rio is more 
straightforward in that it is flat and already partially developed.

'But
our approach has been very similar, especially with regards to leaving a
legacy and in using Brazilian architects in the same way

All smiles: Hanway stands over the model. Venues such as the velodrome and aquatics
centre are already at the site, requiring only minor conversions to 
bring them up to standard to host the Games. And unlike London, the park
will also host the Olympic tennis

British
architects were used in London. That is something that was key in 
London and Eduardo (Eduardo Paes, the Mayor of Rio) was keen to do the 
same.

'We are already 
talking about some interesting ideas of converting some of the temporary
venues into public buildings, like schools after the games. That is 
really exciting.'

Hanway said one of the main challenges facing Rio was public transport. The city of six million people has just two metro lines.

'The
authorities are working on the transport and are extending the lines 
out to the park. The good thing for us, is a lot of the upgrades will be
done in time for the World Cup in 2014,' he said.

Venues
such as the velodrome and aquatics centre are already at the site, 
requiring only minor conversions to bring them up to standard to host 
the Games. And unlike London, the park will also host the Olympic 
tennis.

The images also show how the park will appear in 'legacy mode' after the Games when the temporary venues have been removed.

Barra
da Tijuca, known as Barra by locals, is situated in the south west of 
Rio. It is known for its pristine Atlantic beaches and lush greenery.

Outside
of Barra, the neighbourhood of Copacabana, famous for its long stretch 
of white beach, will host the rowing, sailing, canoeing and beach 
volleyball.

A separate zone
in the Deodoro area of the city will host other competitions including 
modern pentathlon, shooting, equestrian, cycling and fencing.

Legacy: It is hoped that after The Games some of the temporary venues can be converted into public
buildings, like schools. One of the main challenges facing Rio is public transport - the city of six million people has just two metro lines

Good track record: International Architects Studio Aecom, based in Holborn London which was chosen to design the Rio site, was also 
responsible for creating London's much-heralded Olympic park in 
Stratford
