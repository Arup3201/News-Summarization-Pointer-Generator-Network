An Iraq war veteran who was the alleged victim of a racially motivated beating in Mississippi continues to improve but is 'not coming home anytime soon,' his father said.

Former U.S. Marine Ralph Weems, 32, suffered a traumatic brain injury after being attacked by a large group of black men in a restaurant parking lot in West Point in August.

After the attack, Weems had surgery and was put in a medically induced coma. He began treatment at a VA rehabilitation facility in Texas where he learned to walk again and is now set to move to a facility in either Louisiana or Arkansas.

Weems and his friend were followed to the parking lot of this Huddle House by a group of more than 20 black men who proceeded to attack them

'He's physically made a lot of improvements,' Weems III told the Clarion-Ledger. 'Traumatic brain injury takes a long time to recover in a lot of ways.'

A Gofundme webpage setup to help pay for his medical expenses has so far received over $9,000, but is hoping to raise $25,000.

Weems and a friend visited a Waffle House in late August, but soon left after a man politely told the pair that the restaurant was not safe for white people.

David Knighten of West Point said the man told him that people were upset by the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson just weeks earlier.

The pair went into the restaurant anyway, but Weems started arguing with around seven black men and so they left, said Knighten.

A Waffle House employee told police who answered a 1am disturbance call that a patron was creating a disturbance and upsetting other patrons.

Courtez McMillian, Constance McFarland and Marquavious McMillian, from left to right, have been charged with aggravated assault in connection with the alleged attack

After Weems was asked to leave, employees also asked the other patrons to leave.

On the way to Weems' house, Knighten said, they went into a Huddle House restaurant with a nearly vacant parking lot but were followed by a group of more than 20 black men.

Knighten, who had served with the Air Force in Afghanistan, said he came out of the restroom to find Weems surrounded. 'I was trying to defuse the situation,' he said.

After some shoving, he said, the security guard told everyone to leave.

Knighten said some people blocked him from leaving with Weems.

When he got out, he said, Weems was down and people were kicking him.

After the attack, Weems had brain surgery and was put in a medically induced coma. He began treatment at a VA rehabilitation facility in Texas and is now set to move to a facility in either Louisiana or Arkansas

Knighten said others attacked him, adding 'I do remember racial slurs being yelled from the crowd.'

Police were called to the Huddle House about 2am and West Point Police Chief Tim Brinkley said the evidence suggested it was 'a verbal altercation turned physical and somebody got hurt.'

The FBI and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation have yet to determine if the case is a hate crime.

In November, Constance Levail McFarland, 21, became the third man to be charged with aggravated assault in connection with the alleged attack.

Marquavious McMillian, 20, and Courtez McMillian, 22, were arrested in August in connection with the incident.
