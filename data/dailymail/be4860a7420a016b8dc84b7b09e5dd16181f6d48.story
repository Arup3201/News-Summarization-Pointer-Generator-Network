A group of dancers move with perfect grace and precision, their beautiful diaphanous gowns catching the light with every pirouette and leap.

The English National Ballet's new production of Swan Lake, seen here in final dress rehearsal before opening tonight, is bringing the magic of the classic Tchaikovsky work back to London.

The tale of the beautiful Odette transformed into a swan by a sorcerer's curse will entrance London audiences at the London Coliseum until 18 January.

Prima ballerinas Alina Cojocaru and Tamara Rojo will alternate playing Odette, the beautiful woman enslaved by a sorcerer.

Romanian-born Alina is a principal dancer with the English National Ballet after leaving the Royal Ballet in 2013.

Tamara Rojo, 40, is the ballet company's artistic director, and recently dispelled the myth that the two dancers were bitter rivals. 

'I think that is one of those myths, like ballet being an elite art,” she told the Telegraph. 

'I think what people don’t understand is that your biggest rival is always yourself. It is your own perceived limitations that keep you wanting to do more and do better.'

In Swan Lake, Prince Siegfried turns 21 and out hunting meets Odette, a beautiful woman who's been turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer Rothbart.

Only his pure love can save her she tells him yet before he can do anything, the women are compelled to dance as swans by the lake far from the prince's reach.

The ballet inspired the film Black Swan starring Natalie Portman as the dancer driven insane by the demands of the role.

Swan Lake was premiered by Russia's Bolshoi ballet in Moscow in 1877.
