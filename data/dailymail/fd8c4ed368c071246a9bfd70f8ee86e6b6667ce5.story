The Foreign Office are used to dealing with Brits abroad who have lost their passports or suffered a serious injury while abroad.

But they also had a bizarre range of requests from citizens - including one holidaymaker in Rome who asked staff to translate a phrase he wanted for a tattoo.

How to silence a noisy cockerel and contact details for Sir Paul McCartney’s wife are some of the other more unusual questions officials have been asked.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office dealt with more than one million enquiries last year and helped 52,135 British nationals in difficulties abroad.

While they deal with thousands of serious cases, they have their time wasted with some strange questions from people overseas.

In a bid to deter people from wasting their time, the Foreign Office released a list of the more unusual requests they received.

In Beijing, consular staff were asked to help a woman who had bought a pair of football boots that were ‘Made in China’ but were poor quality.

A woman requested that staff in Tel Aviv, Israel order her husband to get fit and eat healthily so that they could have children.

And staff in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were asked if the British taxpayer would help pay to send their children to an international school.

One holidaymaker in Montreal, Canada, asked for official advice on the colour of the British passport to settle a £1,000 wager.

Staff around the world have been asked questions about the best place to watch football matches back home.

Mark Simmonds, Minister for Consular 
Affairs, said: 'Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff help many 
thousands of British nationals facing serious difficulties around the 
world every year.

'We also receive over a million 
enquiries each year, so it is important that people understand what we 
can and cannot do to support them when they are abroad.

'We are not in a position to help 
people make travel arrangements or social plans, but we do help those 
who face real problems abroad.

'These can include victims of crime, 
bereaved families who have lost a loved one abroad or Britons who have 
been arrested or detained. We aim to continue to focus on supporting 
those who really need our help in the coming year.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office set up a contact centre in Malaga
in February 2011 to handle the more unusual questions 
received by British Embassies and Consulates across Southern Europe.

Since
its launch staff have handled 131,211 calls, 39 per cent of which have been 
lifestyle enquiries.
