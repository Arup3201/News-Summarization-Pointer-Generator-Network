Little Ariana Sufi has amazed her parents after learning how to say 'I love you' - aged just seven weeks.

Proud father Ali Sufi, 25, was tucking his daughter into bed for an afternoon nap when he told her he loved her - and was stunned when she said it back.

The baffled sales assistant repeated the amazing conversation to his partner Fatima, 22, who thought he was joking - until she heard her daughter speak for herself.

Ariana now tries to say 'I love you' whenever she hears the phrase - and her parents are expecting her to grow up into a very chatty child.

Ali, from Kilburn, north-west London, said: 'She was in her cot bed and I said to her once "I love you" and she said it back.

'I thought I was going crazy, and that I must have been imagining it or I couldn’t hear it properly.

'I told my partner and she said "you’re lying, you’re lying" but I showed her again and now she keeps trying to say it all the time.

'She isn’t very good at saying the "I" but you can always clearly hear the "love you".

'We are really proud - babies just don’t speak this quick.'

Baby Ariana was born in December last year and first made her declaration of love in early February when she was just seven weeks and one day old.

Her words have since been caught on camera by Ali, who in the clip can be heard repeating 'I love you' in a sing-song tone.

Ariana, who is now 12 weeks old, appears to be trying to say something before she blurts out 'love you'.

Babies don’t usually start speaking full words until they are more than a year old.

'When she was just three or four weeks old she was saying "ahhs" and she has always been a very active baby,' said Ali.

'She is always punching, and giggling and smiling. I have always talked to her quite a lot, and love talking and playing with her.

'The first time she did it she was one month and 22 days.

'I’ve always thought she was quite smart. She recognises people already.

'I think we are going to have a very noisy home and a chatty baby as she learns more words.'

This story comes after Toni and Paul McCann from Ireland released a video of their adorable son Cillian saying his first word at just seven weeks old.

The tiny tot, who is now nine weeks old, was filmed by his 36-year-old mother who says that she knew he had been trying to communicate for a while.

Toni said: 'He was trying to speak for a while but that day I knew he was trying to say something.

'I'd read that babies communicate from a young age and to give them space to answer when you talk to them.

'That was I was doing that day and because he was so alert and making such good eye contact I decided to video him. You can tell my total shock when he came out with "hello".'

In the short clip, Cillian can be seen moving his mouth around trying to talk. After making several attempts he eventually comes out with his first word. 

Last year, a video of an infant saying 'I love you' went viral. 

Stephanie Passalacqua reveals in her description of the impressive video that the baby's father noticed her trying to mimic all his words.

The baby's gaze never leaves her father's face as he tries several times to get her to defy all reason by speaking the words.

Finally, after a few laboured attempts, the baby manages to just about blurt out the words.
