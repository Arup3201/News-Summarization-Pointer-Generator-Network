A long-haul truck driver and practicing Sikh was allegedly called a 'depraved terrorist' by police and threatened with jail by a judge for wearing a 'rag' on his head after being pulled over in Mississippi.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed two complaints of harassment over the case, in which Jagjeet Singh, 49, was arrested for refusing to turn over his kirpan, a three-inch ceremonial dagger that all Sikh men are required to carry as part of their faith.

The blade is typically sewn into the waistband and rarely, if ever, brandished in public.

Truck driver Jagjeet Singh, a devotee of the Sikh faith, was arrested in Mississippi for refusing to surrender his Kirpan (right), which local police claimed was an illegal weapon and allegedly called him a 'terrorist'. Sikh men are expected to carry a Kirpan - a small sword usually worn on the waistband - at all times, much as a Christian might wear a crucifix as a necklace.Â 

Singh was driving from California to Texas on January 16 to pick up a chicken delivery when he was stopped by two officers from the Department of Transportation (DOT) for driving with a flat tyre in Pike County, Miss.

According to the ACLU complaint - which is claiming a 'disgraceful' infringement of religious rights and has been lodged with Mississippi officials - the officers 'laughed' and 'mocked' Singh when he attempted to explain his kirpan was not illegal and actually a sacred religious article.

'One officer declared that all Sikhs are depraved and ''terrorists'',' the ACLU said in a letter to the DOT.

Indian Sikh devotees gather next to the illuminated Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar on September 1, 2013. A recent survey found that most Americans wrongly believed Sikhism is a sect of Islam.

Sikhism is a progressive religion founded in the Punjab region (eastern Pakistan and northern India) over 500 years ago by Nanak. There are approximately 30 million followers worldwide. Sikh's devote themselves to a remembrance of God at all times, honest living and equality of mankind. They denounce superstition. They follow the teachings of 10 Gurus enshrined in the Sikh Holy Book. It is largely considered one of the only religions to give equal rights to men and women, with both sexes allowed to take part in Sikh religious ceremonies. The founder Nanak (1469 - 1538) was born into a Hindu family, but said he received a call from God establishing him as a guru, making the assertion: 'There is no Muslim, and there is no Hindu.'

Singh was taken into custody for refusing to obey a command and was forced to return to Mississippi on March 26 for a court hearing.

At the hearing, Judge Aubrey Rimes of the Pike County Justice Court ejected Singh from the courtroom because of the turban he was wearing, stating that he would not be allowed to re-enter unless he removed "that rag" from his head.

However Singh's faith mandates the covering and he believes that to unwrap it in public would be both sacrilegious and shameful.

The ACLU have since made their complaints public to condemn Singh's terrible treatment.

The case follows the attack of Columbia professor Dr. Prabhjot Singh, who was set upon by a hate mob in Harlem last weekend.

Dr Prabhjot Singh, a Harlem practitioner, Columbia professor and practicing Sikh, was attacked by a gang in Harlem last Saturday night in what police believe was a hate crime.

Dr Singh was repeatedly punched in the head and torso by a gang that approached him on bikes about 8:15 p.m. as he walked along 110th Street near Lenox Avenue in upper Manhattan.

Speaking about the attack, Dr Singh who was called 'Osama' and 'terrorist', said the incident was a reminder of the need for a 'national conversation' about what it means to be American.

'Ultimately, to simply punish the individuals who've acted out on hate crimes is insufficient," he told HuffPost Live.

'More broadly, we need to have a real national conversation around who looks American, what does it mean to be American.'

Earlier this month a Stanford University survey found even though almost all turban-wearers in America are Sikh, about 70 per cent of Americans misidentify them as Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus or members of the Shinto faith.

The survey also found that half of Americans believe Sikhism is an arm of Islam.

When contacted by the ABC for comment, a DOT spokesman said the most recent Singh case was a 'personal matter'.

'We just got the letter. We're looking into the allegations,' the spokesman, Jared Ravencraft, said.

The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed they were investigating the Pike County nondiscrimination policy.
