Murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko told a friend days before his death that the Kremlin would never risk assassinating a British national on London's streets, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Mr Litvinenko confided in Yuri Felshtinsky that he was sure his British citizenship was an 'insurance'.

The former FSB agent, who became a critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin after he fled to Britain, was poisoned after drinking tea spiked with Polonium-210 in November 2006.

Mr Felshtinsky, who is expected to give evidence to the Litvinenko inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, met the spy on October 13.

Speaking from his home in Falmouth, Massachusetts, Mr Felshtinsky said: 'He told me, 'I have just received my British citizenship, now they will never touch me.' He was sure they would never try to kill a British citizen in London.'

The revelation comes as senior Ukip politician Gerard Batten claimed last night that his website had been hacked by Russian agents after posts accusing Putin of murder.

The Ukip MEP, who also posted the Government had 'taken little or no action' to explain a number of other deaths of Russians in the UK, said his team had told him the hack was from Russia.
