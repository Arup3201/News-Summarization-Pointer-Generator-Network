A patient being kept in isolation at a New York hospital over concerns that he may have contracted Ebola while traveling in West Africa has tested negative for the virus.

Health officials said that the man, who has not been identified, had been admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Monday, with a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The patient, who had recently returned from a country where the virus has been reported, was said to be improving, but a hospital spokesman has not said what illness he contracted.Â

All clear: A patient being treated in an isolation ward at Mount Sinai in New York City does not have Ebola, hospital officials have said

'The patient is in stable condition, is improving, and remains in the care of our physicians,' the spokesman said.

On Wednesday, the hospital confirmed that tests carried out on the patient showed that the illness was not Ebola.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said six people in the U.S., including the New York patient, have been tested for Ebola since the West African outbreak erupted this year, and all results were negative.

Officials at U.S. airports are watching travelers from Africa for flu-like symptoms that could be tied to the recent Ebola outbreak there.

The Ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever that has killed more than 900 people, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. It is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids.

Border patrol agents at airports in New York and Washington have been told to ask travelers about possible exposure to the virus, and to be on the lookout for anyone with a fever, diarrhea, red eyes or other symptoms.

Health officials have said that the threat to Americans at home remains relatively small.
