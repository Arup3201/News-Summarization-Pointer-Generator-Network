Jeremy Lin has signed a major endorsement deal with Volvo to become a spokesman for the car company, focusing on the U.S. and Chinese markets.

The New York Knicks player will act as a 'brand ambassador' for two years and appear in advertising, executives for the car manufacturer revealed at a press conference today.

Lin, 23, was also in attendance and spoke of his reasons for partnering with Volvo. Reading from a statement, he said: 'What Volvo stand for is very in line with what I believe as a person.'

It was one of the first major corporate deals for Harvard graduate Jeremy Lin - for which the financial details have not been disclosed.

Volvo is a Swedish car maker owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. It is hoped that by bringing Lin on board, who has become an idol for Chinese basketball fans, it will boost car sales across China.

Freeman Shen, chairman of Volvo in China, said: 'For our region, Jeremy Lin is the pride of the whole Chinese population, and we are excited to work with him.'

Jeremy Lin also has a lesser deal with Nike from when he was a rookie player but the sports brand was now planning a Lin-themed shoe.

The American-born son of Taiwanese parents, Lin has achieved cult status since his breakout 25-point game against the New Jersey Nets last month.

'Linsanity' swept the U.S. and rescued the New York Knicks from a disastrous season. The coined word has also
caused a trademark war with seven patent applications filed, including 
one by Pamela Deese, who is a lawyer representing Lin since he became a 
star player.

The catchphrase for the former Golden 
State Warriors player from Palo Alto, California, has been splashed 
across everything from mobile phone cases and sunglasses to action 
figures and footwear, but a trademark can take a year or more to 
register.

The NBA said Lin jerseys have been the hottest selling shirts at its online store since his performance against the Nets.

Lin famously used to sleep on the sofa
of his New York University student brother Joshua in Manhattanâ€™s Lower 
East Side. However he has 
since moved up in the world.

His two-bedroom rental, listed at 
$13,000 a month, is on the 38th floor of the residences at the W New 
York Downtown Hotel and looks out over the Statue of Liberty.
