A disgusted mother claims she found a dead lizard in a tin of baby formula she had bought from a Coles store in Sydney.

Artilina Castanares, 30, posted a picture of her find on the supermarket chain's Facebook page. She described how she had opened the lid and immediately noticed a foul odour.

She told Fairfax Media she then shuffled the powder around and found an 'absolutely disgusting and unacceptable' dead animal lying inside. 

The tin of powder contains would could be a foreign lizard from Singapore, the place where the product was originally packaged

The tin of s26 original progress formula was bought from a Rouse Hill Coles supermarket in western Sydney, but it was manufactured and packaged in Singapore.

Ms Castanares has pleaded with Coles to recall all the formula after being told by the product manufacturer, Careline, that it would take between six and eight weeks to investigate because the product would need to be sent back to Singapore.

Sydney mother Artilina Castanares posted details of her gruesome discovery on Facebook

She was told she would be sent a replacement tin, but insisted she didn't care much for that because she would never buy the product again.

Instead, Ms Castanares has turned to regular milk for feeding her baby.

'I called Careline and they advised would send me a replacement tin which I don't care for!' she wrote.

'They advised will need to investigate which will take about 6-8 weeks as need to send product overseas.'

She said a turnaround of this length was 'unacceptable.' She has also notified the NSW Food Authority who are investigating further.

Ms Castanares said she wants to highlight the risk that something like this could potentially be putting babies at risk of contracting diseases.

Ms Castanares told Fairfax Media that other mothers had contacted her in complete shock after making her discovery public on a Sydney mothers’ group Facebook page, and on the product’s Facebook page.

'Some parents are freaking out over it. I’m getting private messages, emails, from mothers with the same batch number,' she wrote.

A flood of comments were also shared publicly on Coles' Facebook page, with most users either sharing their horror and agreeing that an investigation was warranted.

Ms Castanares was directed by a spokesperson to contact Careline's parent organisation - Aspen Australia.
