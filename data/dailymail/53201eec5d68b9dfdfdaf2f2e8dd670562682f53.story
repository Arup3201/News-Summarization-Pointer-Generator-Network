Angel di Maria has taken time out to reply to fan mail sent from hundreds of his adoring fans.

Despite the fact he is missing Manchester United's clash with Stoke at Old Trafford on Tuesday night due to a hamstring injury, the Red Devils midfielder posed for a snap with hundreds of letters splayed across a table.

Di Maria's partner Jorgelina Cardoso posted the image on her Instagram account and said: 'Thank you very much for your support!'

The Argentina international was forced off with a hamstring injury during United's 3-0 win over Hull City

Di Maria's wife Jorgelina Cardoso replied to a United fan's direct message on Instagram to say Di Maria had sustained 'Hay un pequeno desgarro' ('a small tear') to his hamstring during the victory over Hull

Ander Herrera replaced the injured Di Maria in the 14th minute in the victory over Hull

The Argentina star was forced off after just 14 minutes of United's 3-0 victory over Hull on Saturday after injuring his hamstring.

United boss Louis van Gaal had revealed Di Maria would 'not be out for six months' straight after the win against the Tigers before the midfielder's wife confirmed on Instagram that he had suffered a 'small tear'.

The 26-year-old hit the ground running at Old Trafford after arriving from Real Madrid in a £60million deal during the summer, scoring three times, but has struggled a bit of late.

Still, United will hope to have him fit and firing again soon.
