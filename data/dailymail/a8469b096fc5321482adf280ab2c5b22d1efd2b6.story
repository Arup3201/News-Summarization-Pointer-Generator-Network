Fighter: Phoenix bus driver Todd Allen Shields was arrested Friday for beating up a passenger

A bus driver in Phoenix, Arizona was arrested Friday for beating up a 21-year-old man who tried to use a reduced-fare metro card for minors.

The driver, 45-year-old Todd Allen Shields, was stopped at the Montebello and 19th Avenue bus stop in Phoenix when the young man tried to get on his bus with the reduced fare card.

Shields didn't believe that the man was young enough to use it and demanded he show ID.

The man refused and that's when 
things got heated. A verbal argument ensued and eventually the bus 
driver threw the man off the bus.

Desirae Madrid was on the bus when the fight took place and recorded the incident on her phone.

'The bus driver stood up and picked 
him up to where the kid's feet was literally off the floor and threw him
 out and I just remember seeing the kid fly off the other side of the 
little block that's there and his feet were literally in the air,' 
Madrid told Fox 10.

Outside
 on the sidewalk the driver continued to punch and beat the man - even 
slamming his head onto a metal bench. Only one man tried to break up the
 fight.

While Madrid 
noticed other passengers recording the incident, she was the only one to
 call police and wait around to give a report of what happened.

She says she watched her video over and over, and it still shocks her to see what happened.

'It makes me angry and sick to my stomach,' Madrid told ABC 15. 'He is the driver and deals with the public every day. He is supposed to be a professional.'

The driver is an employee of Veolia Transportation, a Phoenix city contractor that runs the bus system. They released a statement Friday saying that the driver was put on investigative leave, pending a formal investigation into the incident.

'I hope that the bus driver loses his job and can't work with [the] public,' Madrid said.

Shields was arrested Friday afternoon and charged with assault in addition to disorderly conduct and criminal damage.

Police say the man he beat up is ok, and only suffered minor injuries.
