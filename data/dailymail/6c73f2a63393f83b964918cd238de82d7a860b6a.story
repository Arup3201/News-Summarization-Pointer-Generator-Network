As part of Navy procedure, incoming female recruits have been forced to cut their hair so that it is only reaches 'the lower edge of the uniform collar' when they enter the boot camp pilot program.

But now, after complaints from some sailors that the short haircuts do not properly prepare women for service - where longer hair is allowed - the Navy has temporarily halted the procedure as part of a trial.

Recruits entering the program for the first three months of this year - starting this week - will be able to keep their long hair, so long as it keeps with the overall grooming policy, such as keeping it in a strict bun.

The Navy had been the only remaining branch of the U.S. armed services to still require short hair. 

New trial: For the first three months of this year, incoming female recruits will be allowed to keep their hair long, while have previously been forced to cut it above the collar upon entry.

They have set up an interactive web page showing hairstyles what is acceptable as per the grooming regulations, from how to maintain everything from pixie cuts to corn rows.

For longer hair, 'no portion of the bulk of the hair (minus the bun) will exceed two inches, as measured from the scalp,' the website states. 

The Navy said the move is 'an effort to standardize training and education across the military services'.

Time reported that the change came about following complaints that the short hair requirements didn't prepare women for graduating from boot camp, after which their hair can be longer. 

The Navy said there was 'fleet feedback that junior Sailors and officers are not taught proper grooming standards with longer hair'. 

'Grooming standards education will be incorporated into the curriculum, but will not impact other training,' the Navy said in a statement.

Strict grooming policy: On its website, the Navy has instructions on how to keep every hairstyle, from long hair to short, curly to straight

Under a new pilot program, the armed services branch will no longer require females to cut their hair short

'This will allow women to style longer hair in the same manner that they would wear it daily in the Fleet while providing the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the standards before transferring to the Fleet.'

However, 'females requesting a haircut may still receive one', the service branch said.

It is tradition for recruits to have a haircut on arrival at the camp. 

Time also reported that the move may also be implement for incoming male soldiers who have longer hair. 

Men are currently required to have their heads shaved - no longer than an eighth-inch - upon arrival.

Are they next?: There are suggestions that the hair requirements for male recruits may also soon change
