A state prosecutor has been charged after biting a man's leg during a drunken fracas at an adult store, authorities said.

Sarah Naughton, an assistant state's attorney for four years, was facing charges of misdemeanor battery and criminal trespass after the attack on Saturday night.

Naughton and a male companion both appeared to be intoxicated, according to police, and were asked to leave shortly after they entered Taboo Tabou in Chicago.

Hysterical: The 31-year-old lawyer abused the officers who were arresting her in Chicago

However, 31-year-old Naughton became 
belligerent and bit a manager. According to authorities, her friend, 
Bradley Gould, shoved the worker and made 'menacing gestures'.

The store owner took the manager to a nearby hospital for treatment and he was later released.

Police arrived and placed the lawyer in handcuffs. She began wailing loudly that she couldn't feel her hands because they were 'too tight'.

She rocked 
backwards and forwards on the curb, crying hysterically and at one point, called the arresting female 
police officer: 'AÂ  f****** b**** w****.' Her behavior was captured on video by a passer-by.

After being taken away in a police van, Naughton was charged and released on bond.

Taboo Tabou owner Mark Thomas told ABC: 'My staff asked, ''Have you folks been drinking? Maybe you should come back when you're sober.'''

Mr Thomas then said that Miss Naughton became enraged and started to tell them what she did for a living, pulling out a badge and adding: 'You can't do this to me...I'm a state's attorney.'

Cook County spokesman Andy Conklin said Naughton had been placed on administrative leave during the investigation.

It's was not immediately known if Naughton and Gould had legal representation and the results of toxicology reports were unknown.
