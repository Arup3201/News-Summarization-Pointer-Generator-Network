With an annual passenger load that rivals the population of a large country, the world’s busiest airport isn’t found in New York, London, Tokyo or Beijing.

The location may surprise you even though it has had a stranglehold on the title for nearly two decades.

For the 16th consecutive year, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the US state of Georgia has been crowned the most heavily used airport in the world.

Busiest in the world: 94.4 million travellers passed through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport 

According to data released by Airports Council International (ACI), 94.4 million travellers passed through the suburban Atlanta airport in 2013, down 1.1 per cent from 2012.

It is consistently the busiest in the world because it is a major hub for domestic flights and routes to Europe and South America. 

Beijing Capital International Airport was the second busiest in the world with 83.7 million passengers, an increase of 2.2 per cent compared with the previous year.

In third place was London Heathrow Airport, which saw its passenger totals increase 3.3 per cent to 72.4 million.

London remained the world’s largest airport system with almost 140 million passengers handled at six airports, and Heathrow had the most international passengers (67.3 million). 

Rounding out the top five were Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) and Chicago O’Hare International Airport.

The top 10 was largely unchanged, although the rankings signal Dubai’s emergence as one of the fastest growing airports in the world.

Dubai International Airport climbed from tenth to seventh place with 66.4 million passengers, a year-to-year increase of 15 per cent.

Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport dropped from seventh to eighth, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport claimed the ninth spot and Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta airport came in tenth.

The study analysed passenger traffic at nearly 2,000 airports in 160 countries and found that passenger growth increased around the world.

Angela Gittens, director general of ACI World, said in a statement: ‘With many major economies remaining in a fragile state, 2013 can best be characterized as a year of unstable recovery for the global economy.’

‘Despite this challenging operating climate, worldwide traffic surpassed the six billion passenger mark in 2013. This represents an enormous feat for the airport industry as we commemorate the 100th anniversary of commercial aviation in 2014.’
