A Turkish court ordered that a man 
accused of killing a New York City woman in Istanbul be placed under 
observation for an evaluation of his mental health on the opening day of
his trial Tuesday.

In 
his first testimony in court, Ziya Tasali, 46, admitted killing Sarai 
Sierra but denied accusations that he had sexually assaulted her, the 
private Dogan news agency reported.

Sierra,
a 33-year-old mother of two boys, was found dead on Feb. 2, days after 
her family reported her missing when she failed to return home from a 
solo vacation in Istanbul. Her body was discovered hidden near the 
remnants of Istanbul's ancient city walls and authorities said she was 
killed by a blow to the head.

Admission: Tasali said in an interview shortly after his capture that he 'hit the woman's head with a stick' after sniffing paint thinner

Tasali
was arrested near the Syrian border in March. He had been on the run 
since Sierra's body was found and was believed to be in hiding in Syria.

During trial, Tasali described himself as a scrap-paper collector with no fixed address.

He admitted fatally hitting Sierra with a rock but disputed charges of sexual assault.

'I
was sitting beneath the walls. I had sniffed paint thinner (vapors) and
was high,' Dogan quoted him as telling the court in Istanbul.

'I
approached her and wanted to kiss her. But she hit me with her phone 
between my two eyebrows. I pushed her and she fell on the ground,' he 
said.

Tasali said 
Sierra fought him back and hit him in the face with a rock, which made 
him 'totally lose control.' He said he then struck Sierra with a rock.

Questioned about traces of his sperm found over the victim and some of her belongings, Tasali denied rape.

A
defense lawyer said he did not believe his client was 'capable of 
grasping the meaning and results' of his actions. Judges hearing the 
case ordered state forensic medical experts to place Tasali under 
observation and report back on his mental health, the news agency said.

The court then adjourned the trial until Nov. 21.

Prosecutors
are demanding a life sentence for Tasali on murder charges as well as 
19 years in prison for sexual assault and theft.

Sierra
had traveled to Turkey to explore her photography hobby. She came to 
Istanbul alone after her friend canceled for financial reasons.

Grief: Steven refused to talk about the claims leaked to the media by Turkish police about her liaisons with a man named Taylan K

Heading home: A casket carrying the remains of Sierra is prepared to be loaded onto a flight at the Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, Turkey, ahead of its flight to the U.S. last month
