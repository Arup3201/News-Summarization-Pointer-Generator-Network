It’s the equivalent of three Big Macs, will take at least two hours to burn off and at 1,500 calories, has almost the entire recommended daily calorie intake for women.

The Gut Buster burger has fried bacon, cheese and a beef patty stuffed between two original glazed Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

Medical experts have said it is a ‘heart attack’ waiting to happen… and even its inventor called it unhealthy.

The Gut Buster: Fried bacon, cheese and a beef patty between two original glazed Krispy Kreme doughnuts

The fatty creation is the brainchild of restaurateur Johnny Wong, owner of Johnny’s Burger Joint, Canning Vale, Perth, Australia. 

Mr Wong posted pictures of the burger on the diner’s Facebook page.

The grotesque snack has the dubious honour of being crowned the ‘most unhealthy burger in the city.’ 

His restaurant also serves the 12-spoon-chilli-topped Demon’s Revenge and the Burgerzilla - a breakfast, lunch and dinner monster burger that has five meat patties and six slices of cheese.

The 22-year-old described the burger to Australia's 9 News reporter Oliver Peterson as a ‘magnificent piece of art’.

Customers at the fast food joint have already sampled the Gut Buster, claiming that it 'tastes better than it looks.'

According to 9 News, Mr Wong was inspired by the burgers he saw when he was at a fast food fair in the US.

But Dr Michael Gannon from the Australian Medical Association was unimpressed.

‘This is a heart attack waiting to happen. Food vendors have a responsibility to sell responsible products,’ he said to 9 News.

And even Mr Wong agrees. 

'I’m not planning to put it on the menu for long as it’s not that healthy,' he said.
