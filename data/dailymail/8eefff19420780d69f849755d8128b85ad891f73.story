A girl who was driven to quit college when she was bullied for her looks feels she has now had the last laugh by becoming a beauty queen.

Jade Colcombe, 20, dropped out of college after she was subjected to a torrent of abuse by bullies who said she looked like a man.

From the age of 12, tormented Jade, from Tonypandy, Wales, would skip school and fake illness in a desperate attempt to avoid the verbal abuse which reduced her to tears on a daily basis.

Her school bullies even threatened to kill her because she wore 'tomboy' clothes instead of make-up or expensive branded clothing.

Jade has overcome years of torment and low-self esteem, conquering her own personal demons by entering beauty contests

The bullies called Jade a host of names, including 'a man', leaving her in tears nearly every day

Jade explained: 'There have been times where I just felt like breaking down a crying.

'I'd walk into the room and the 'popular' gang would sit and snigger just because I didn't have expensive clothes or wear make-up.

'I was called 'buck-tooth', because of my teeth, 'Dalmatian', because of my beauty spots and 'man' because the hair on my arm was dark and noticeable.

'The thought of having to go back to school as a total outcast really got me down.'

Jade, who started doing karate at the age of 11 for self-protection, says she quit sixth form halfway through her A levels because she felt like an 'outcast'.

Jade was encouraged by family to enter Miss Radiant Photogenic UK 2014 to build her confidence

Instead, she went on to study art and design at another college, but despite the change, still found the girls would snigger at her dress sense and call her ugly and stupid.

However, defiant Jade hit back at her bullies in the most unexpected way.

After enduring years of put downs from bullies who told her she would achieve nothing in life, she was encouraged by family and friends to enter Miss Radiant Photogenic UK 2014 to build her confidence and prove her bullies wrong.

To her amazement, she was crowned queen, which spurred her on to claim her second title, Miss Supermodel Great Britain 2014 at Dream Street's Miss United Kingdom pageant, earlier this month.

And despite dropping out of her A levels, she's now secured a top job as a quantity surveyor.

She said: 'To be honest, the bullies did me a favour.

'At my lowest point, I refused to talk to anyone because I feared that they would just laugh at me.

'But for the first time at Miss UK, I actually spoke in front of an audience without getting upset or really nervous about it.

'And now that I am entering national pageants all over the UK, I really feel like I've beat those bullies and proved them wrong.'

Since then, Jade has set her sights on her third title at the final of Miss British Empire Wales.

But despite conquering her own personal demons, Jade says she is yet to face the biggest challenge of her life - climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.

She's attempting to climb 19,341 feet above sea level, in a bid to raise funds for Noah's Ark - a children's hospital in Wales.

She says her sister, Lexi, age two, who suffers from a non-curable form of epilepsy, was saved by doctors at the hospital after violent seizures left her clinging to life.

She said: 'Doctors at Noah's Ark were amazing, they saved my sister's life.

'It's definitely going to be a big challenge, but I feel that I needed to give them something back.

'I beat my bullies, so with the support of my family, beating Kilimanjaro should be no problem.'
