After Tottenham won the north London derby at White Hart Lane last season, Andre Villas-Boas memorably declared Arsenal were 'in a negative spiral of results.'

The Gunners promptly won eight and drew two of their final 10 games and snatched fourth place from AVB’s faltering flops. 

Some things in football never seem to change and Tottenham Hotspur being the laughing stock of the Premier League is one of them.

It is more than 50 years since they won the title, more than 20 years since they won an FA Cup and they've only had one season in the Champions League. These facts should leave all Tottenham fans embarrassed by their football club.

They've been treated to some top quality players down the years, but none of them have turned Spurs into champions.

The club has now appointed a manager, possibly temporarily, who, when things aren’t going his way, throws his jacket to the ground and hurls a ball full force at an opposition player - twice.

I'm puzzled why the FA are ignoring Sherwood’s touchline actions on Sunday. How his players will get any discipline from him is a mystery. I suppose Sherwood thinks a few cheeky-chappy quips in the post-match press conference or a random blast at his players will be the answer.

On top of that, Spurs have had a player in recent seasons, Benoit Assou-Ekotto, who admitted he played for the money and football wasn't his passion. 'It’s a job,' he said, humiliatingly for Spurs, especially as they willingly shovelled thousands of pounds into his bank account for several seasons.

Spurs now have Sandro; a player who seems to show more care and precision with his hair than his passing. He gave the ball away for Arsenal’s goal on Sunday, got booked, substituted and actually contributed very little else to one of Spurs' biggest games of the season. Candidate for worst Premier League Brazilian ever? Possibly.

Players like Assou-Ekotto and Sandro are revered by some fans because they are so 'quirky'. May I suggest Spurs need dedicated and talented professionals rather than characters?

For a short time Harry Redknapp turned Spurs into a top-four club. They were also Champions League quarter-finalists. It now seems ridiculous that Spurs were so happy to let him go. Why didn’t the chairman do more to improve his relationship with Redknapp?

The chairman is the one who can change things at White Hart Lane. The focus now is firmly on the stony-faced silent assassin – Daniel Levy. Is he doing his job properly? Does he have sufficient knowledge of the game to make the right decisions for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club?

How's my hair looking? Tottenham don't need quirky players like Sandro (right) and Benoit Assou-Ekotto

Right man for the job? Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood throws the ball at Arsenal's Bacary Sagna

Anger: Sherwood has struggled to deal with the pressures of managing in the Premier League

People said Spurs played well and didn’t deserve to lose to Arsenal. I disagree. Arsenal took the lead and let Spurs have possession knowing they didn’t have the ability to break the Gunners down.

Spurs' passing was poor, their finishing horrendous and with more penetration needed, Sherwood bizarrely left Aaron Lennon and Kyle Walker on the bench. In fact, Spurs looked weaker after the changes the manager did actually make. It was almost as if Arsenal were carrying out some sort of football experiment on Spurs, or worse still, they were teasing them.

Spurs have been rubbish for too long. What have you got Daniel Levy? Do you know how to stop Spurs being so useless? Let’s see if you’re up to the job...

In the firing line: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy may replace Sherwood in the summer

Not happy: Tottenham fans protest at Levy's handling of the club before the defeat by Arsenal on Sunday

Manchester United players have underperformed this season and their manager has proved to be lacking in man-management skills as well as tactical knowledge. But did you ever see a United side with such awful discipline?

Marouane Fellaini caught Luis Suarez's calf early on, and was lucky to get away with it. Rafael was despicably late on Steven Gerrard and was rightly booked.

They gave away three penalties – perhaps Daniel Sturridge went down easily for the third, but it was a poorly-timed, ill-advised lunge from Vidic.

Arguably there should have been two more spot-kicks; Fellaini and Phil Jones on Suarez in the first half was debatable but Michael Carrick tripping Sturridge in the second half was a stonewall penalty.

And just before Jones' ridiculous challenge on Joe Allen for the penalty at the start of the second half, Fellaini bundled recklessly into Suarez in the penalty area. Rafael should have been sent off; Vidic was dismissed.

Why are well-paid professional footballers at a giant club like Manchester United making such poor decisions on the pitch?

Wembley is supposed to be a special place, isn’t it? So should the play-off, FA Trophy and Johnstone’s Paint finals all be played there?

I must declare an interest here; my team is Peterborough United, and we are going to Wembley for the JP Trophy final on March 30. I have bought tickets already, I will be there with my son and I will thoroughly enjoy the day (if we win). On top of that, I’ve seen Posh win twice at Wembley before – we’ve got a 100 per cent record there, in fact. I celebrated both victories wildly. 

But that doesn’t change my view that the small-time lower league and even non-League finals should not be played at Wembley Stadium. 

I love our striker Britt Assombalonga, but this will be his second game at Wembley, yet he’s only 21 and has started only two games above League One level.

Been there, done that: Crewe players celebrate with the Johnstone's Paint Trophy

He lost the final of the same 
competition last year when he was on loan at Southend. Crewe were 
winners that day which means Arsenal youngster Chuks Aneke, on loan with
 the Alex last season and this, has been a Wembley winner at club level 
more times than fellow Gooners Jack Wilshere, Laurent Koscielny, Santi 
Cazorla and Mikel Arteta combined.

Wembley occasions are wonderful, but 
it should be for true showpiece games – FA Cup and League Cup finals, 
the Championship play-off final, England games, and the Community 
Shield. 

For me, working your way through a sea of League One and League Two mediocrity should not be rewarded with a trip to Wembley.

But
 that’s the way it is – I can’t change that, so I will be there 
supporting my team. If I let my heart rule my head for a moment, then I 
think it’s magical that the club I love is allowed to play at Wembley – I
 can’t wait!

Wembley veteran: Britt Assombalonga will play his second game at the national stadium at the age of 21

In reality though, we all know Peterborough United vs Chesterfield doesn’t really belong at the national stadium.

A word of warning though: having watched Posh put in a totally inept display last week at home to Bristol City – they were so bad I refused to celebrate our goal – I can only hope my team doesn’t disgrace Wembley. 

Some great players never got the chance to play at the home of football, so it doesn’t seem right to me that there are an endless number of journeymen lower league footballers with far less talent and ability who have had the honour and privilege.

They are lucky guys, so I really hope none of them take their good fortune for granted. Come on Posh!

We're going to Wembley! Peterborough prepare for their Johnstone's Paint Trophy final

Congratulations to Arsene Wenger on reaching 1,000 games this weekend. But it’s an empty, meaningless milestone.

The first 500 games included all the trophies. So the 500 since have been relatively unsuccessful.

Incidentally his 500th game was also at Chelsea – the Gunners lost 1-0 to Jose Mourinho’s side. That was just a couple of months after Wenger last picked up a trophy, the FA Cup in 2005.

The truth is Wenger shouldn’t have been allowed to reach 1,000 games at Arsenal. No other big club would have tolerated such failure over such a long period of time.
