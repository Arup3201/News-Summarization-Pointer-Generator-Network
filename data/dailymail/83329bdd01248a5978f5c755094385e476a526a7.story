England laboured to a scrappy 1-0 win against Estonia in Tallinn on Sunday evening, Wayne Rooney's free-kick finally breaking the deadlock against the 10-man hosts.

Roy Hodgson's men enjoyed plenty of possession, but struggled to open up a dogged Estonia outfit. 

Here's how Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein rated England's performances.

Wayne Rooney curls a free kick over the wall and into the corner to finally give England the lead

Joe Hart 6 – Didn't have to be at his shot-stopping best. His presence adds security in tricky away games but distribution let him down on occasions. Geed up the team in the tunnel before kick-off and got the clean sheet.

Calum Chambers 5.5 – Steady in defence but England could have done with a more an attacking outlet at right back given their superiority. This will be an interesting position for Hodgson moving forward, Glen Johnson is better at getting forward but Chambers is younger and steadier. 

Calum Chambers was again selected by Roy Hodgson to start at right back for England, but offered little

Gary Cahill 6.5 – Didn't put a foot wrong either defensively or starting up attacks. Left his calling card on Sergei Zenjov with a strong tackle. He looks set to be the core of England's defence for many years to come.

Phil Jagielka 5.5 – Often had time on the ball without making the most of it. Solid whenever a high ball was hoisted into the England box. Now in his thirties, it is hard to see him improving and Phil Jones will replace him when fit.

Leighton Baines 6 –Still making the runs of old but lacks the dynamism of a couple of years ago. Set up one good chance for Rooney but missed a good free-kick opportunity. Always offered himself as an attacking outlet but against better opposition you fear for him. Booked.

Jack Wilshere 7 – Lacks mobility as a holding midfielder when out of possession, but last night he was able to get forward and set up Rooney's near-miss volley with the pass of the game. Always on the lookout for the ball, won his fair share of free-kicks too. Man of the match.

Jack Wilshere was England's best player on the night, and one pass for Rooney in particular was spectacular

The Arsenal midfielder lacks some of the necessary mobility to thrive in a defensive role, but was impressive

Jordan Henderson 6.5 – Caught early by the gloriously-named Martin Vunk, showed energy thereafter without the cutting edge.  Covers so much ground for England, hard to imagine the team without him. Booked and substituted.

Fabian Delph 6 - Lax pass nearly cost England early on but won the foul that got Estonia skipper Ragnar Klavan sent off. Shows great energy and mobility, perfect for the way Hodgson wants to set up, but not creative enough. Substituted.

Adam Lallana 6 – Found pockets of space between the Estonian lines, making him a more natural No 10 than Sterling. But couldn't pull off that one pass to make the difference. That playmaker's job in the England team is up for grabs.

Fabian Delph offered industry rather than creativity in the middle of the park before he was replaced

Adam Lallana carries the ball forward but England lacked a creative spark in the centre of midfield

Danny Welbeck 5.5 – Not his day. The Estonians were strong enough to counter his physical attributes and he didn't take up enough 'fox in the box' positions. Possibly his biggest contribution was getting shoved by Klavan for the first of his two yellow cards. Substituted.

Wayne Rooney 6.5 – His effort and teamwork were exemplary, and he eventually compensated for two bad misses by scoring his 43rd England goal with a free-kick - before he could be taken off. Should have added a second goal in injury-time but was foiled by the goalkeeper one-on-one.

Danny Welbeck stretches for the ball but it was a match where England's spearhead was not at his sharpest

Substitutes: 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (for Delph 61) 5.5 – Didn't have a big impact after becoming Roy Hodgson's first change

Raheem Sterling (for Henderson 64) 6.5 – Hodgson's decision to hold him back worked with the winger winning the free-kick on the edge of the box for Rooney to score

Rickie Lambert (for Welbeck 80)  

Manager: Roy Hodgson 6.5 – Can be justified in leaving Raheem Sterling on the bench. The Liverpool winger may not have been happy but Hodgson gave him 26 minutes to make a difference, which he did.

Referee: Marijo Strahonja (Croatia) 6.5 – Got his biggest decision right, sending off Estonia captain Ragnar Klavan for two clear yellow card offences on Welbeck and Delph.
