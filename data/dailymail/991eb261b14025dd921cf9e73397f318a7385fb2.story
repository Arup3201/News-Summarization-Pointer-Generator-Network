Celebrities and the super-rich have been forced to pay £210 million through a ‘back-door mansion tax’ in the last two years, new figures have revealed.

The cash has been raked in by the Government from two new levies on luxury homes worth more than £2 million. 

The charges apply when the properties are bought or owned by companies, rather than individuals.

Bob Geldof, Sir Mick Jagger and Britain’s richest men the Hinduja Brothers are among those thought to have been affected by the closure of a loophole which enabled wealthy buyers to avoid stamp duty or possible inheritance tax by holding their homes in so-called ‘corporate envelopes’.

An annual levy of up to £140,000 a year must now be paid on UK homes which are registered to a company, along with a special stamp duty rate of 15 per cent when a property is sold.

The Treasury has reaped much more income than expected from the new fees, in a sign that the wealthy may be happy to pay extra tax on a property in return for privacy or other benefits that come from property ownership through a company.

Figures show that the Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (ATED) brought in an extra £140 million to the Government’s coffers in 2013-14, seven times the Treasury’s own forecast.

The higher stamp duty rate brought in an additional £70 million in its first year (2012-13).

Although HMRC does not comment on individuals’ tax affairs, anti-poverty campaigner Geldof is known to have a home in South London, owned by a company called Quiet Ventures Ltd, and a house in Faversham, Kent, owned by Bandol Holdings Ltd. Both firms are reportedly registered in the British Virgin Islands.

Sources close to the Irish singer have previously described the arrangements as ‘perfectly legitimate’ tax planning.

Friends say the property is only owned by a nominee company for privacy and security reasons, and not to save tax.

It is believed that the Hinduja Brothers must also pay the levy because their property in  Mayfair, Central London, belongs to an offshore firm.

Most of the owners of the luxury London homes at One Hyde Park, Britain’s most expensive property development, are owned by offshore companies – as are the £35 million-plus homes in exclusive Cornwall Terrace, overlooking Regent’s Park.

Action: George Osborne announced the new taxes in 2012 after saying he wanted to come down 'like a ton of bricks' on stamp duty avoidance schemes

Chancellor George Osborne announced the new taxes in 2012 after saying he wanted to come down ‘like a ton of bricks’ on stamp duty avoidance schemes.

The charges are only imposed on homes which are occupied by the beneficiaries of companies. Homes owned by property firms and rented out to tenants are exempt.

The lowest ATED charge in 2013-14 was £15,000 for homes worth £2 million to £5 million, but the highest rate was £140,000 for homes worth more than £20  million.

The stamp duty rate of 15 per cent was imposed in March 2012 on company purchases of homes worth more than £2 million, compared to seven per cent for individuals buying homes in the same price bracket.

The threshold for the tax was reduced to £500,000 in March this year. 

Previously, such homes would have been virtually exempt from stamp duty if an individual buying the property simply bought the ownership of the company, paying a rate of just 0.5 per cent.

Foreigners also had the incentive of registering their homes in the name of offshore companies to avoid paying UK inheritance tax rates of 40 per cent when they died.

The windfall for the taxman is set to be boosted further by a third levy imposing a capital gains tax (CGT) rate of 28 per cent on any profits made on  the sale of ‘corporate envelope’ homes worth more than £2 million.

The Government has increased ATED tax rates in the current year to £15,400 for homes worth £2 million to £5 million and £143,750 for the top-bracket homes worth more than £20 million.

It also plans to create lower thresholds
 over the next two years, with a new ATED rate of £7,000 for 
company-owned homes worth £1-2 million from April next year and a £3,500
 rate for homes worth £500,000 to £1 million in April 2016.

Paul Emery, a real estate tax partner for accountants PWC, likened the three new tax levies to a ‘back-door’ version of the annual one per cent mansion tax, proposed by Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems for all properties worth more than £2 million. 

He added: ‘Constant tinkering with the tax rules is a source of concern for foreign investors who want to see stability.’

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘ATED has raised significantly more revenue than originally forecast. 

‘However, given this is the first year of returns, the increase could be attributed to a number  of factors and it is too early to draw definitive conclusions.’ 

He added: ‘We will  continue to monitor receipts closely.’
