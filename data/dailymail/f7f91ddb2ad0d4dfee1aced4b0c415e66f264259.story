An 11-year-old girl killed by a stray bullet is among the four dead and dozens of other people wounded by yet another brutal weekend of gun violence in Chicago.

Shamiya Adams was making s'mores inside a South Side home for a sleepover Friday night when a bullet went into the house and struck her in the head. Three other people were shot dead and a further 40 were injured, police said.

As usual, the bulk of the violence occurred on the South and West Sides – a refrain that is now playing out in the Windy City on an almost nightly basis.

Adams death shocked a city so used to witnessing dozens of shootings across entire weekends that a website named HeyJacka** is used to track, among other things, how many people are shot in the buttocks each year.

She was murdered despite being seemingly safe and sound inside a West Side home.

‘They were just running around through the house, dancing. That's all they do is dance all the time. And dancing, dancing, dancing,’ homeowner Rosemarie Jones told WLS.

She was rushed to a hospital and died Saturday morning.

‘The familiarity of laughter has been replaced by the familiarity of gunfire,’ Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a Saturday morning press briefing.

The innocent girl was making s'mores with her friends when the bullet struck her, according to the Chicago Tribune. Her young friends saw the bullet strike her head.

Hours after the girl was rushed to a hospital and as police still searched for her killer without any solid leads, marshmallows and chocolate bars were still scattered over the bed Adams and friends were on, according to the paper.

Spattered traces of the 11-year-old girl's blood were observed just under a stuffed Tweety Bird doll hanging on the wall. Adams was enjoying her summer vacation with her friends like any other girl her age.

'They were just doing their girlie things,' a resident of the house who was not home at the time of the shooting told the paper. 'They heard shots and a bullet came through the window.'

Adams’ mother was protective of her to 
the point the young girl was rarely allowed to go out, those who knew 
her say. It was the 11-year-old’s first sleepover.

‘She
 don't let Shamiya go much unless she go to family and then the first 
time you let her go something like this happens? This is really eating 
her up,’ Nanette Dailey told the station.

There were three other people shot dead, including a 30-year-old man found with gunshot wounds to his neck, back and shoulder, according to the Chicago Tribune.

His dead body was found at 3.00 a.m. Saturday night sitting in a car parked in a gritty alley, cops said.

A 24-year-old man was found dead after a gunman opened fire around 2.30 a.m. inside a South Side bar, police told WLS. he had at least one gunshot wound to his chest.

The bar is a known street gang hangout, according to the Chicago Tribune, and police believe the murder to be gang-related.

Another man with multiple gunshot wounds to his torso was taken from the bar to a hospital in critical condition.

A Saturday night block party on the West Side took a violent turn after five people were shot, one dead. 

The deceased was a 21-year-old male with multiple gunshot wounds to the head and body. He survived the ambulance ride to a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead soon after arriving, police told WMAQ.

The four other people injured included a 43-year-old woman and a 53-year-old male cab driver. The 21-year-old and the 43-year-old were getting into the cab when all hell broke loose.

She sustained a shot to the leg and a graze wound to the head, the cabbie was shot several times in the abdomen and both thighs - both are in stable condition at a local hospital.

‘I
 got nothing left to say to these moms,’ Emanuel continued. ‘I don't 
know where they find the strength to go on, put one foot in front of 
another. Because she had the... she wanted her daughter to play with her
 friends. We're a better city than that.’

But statistics paint a different picture.

Despite city officials infamously claiming “crime is down” earlier this year, murders are on pace to at least equal last year’s total.

There have so far this year been 223 shooting deaths this year, according to an independent website that tracks crime and mayhem in Chicago.

There were 454 shooting deaths in Chicago in 2013.

Among the other injured were four men who showed up Saturday night with unexplained gunshot wounds at a West Side hospital, authorities said.

Several people - including a 50-year-old woman, two men playing basketball and multiple men walking on sidewalks in unrelated incidents - showed up at local hospitals saying they 'heard gunshots and felt pain,' police said.

Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

A male and female were shot while pumping gas after a gunman approached them and opened fire, police said. They drove themselves to the hospital and are in stable condition.

Two 15-year-old boys were also shot Saturday evening in unrelated incidents. One suffered only a wound to his leg, the Tribune reported. The other told doctors he was on a sidewalk when someone walked up and shot him in the arm and foot.

A 26-year-old was shot Saturday night after arguing with a male in a car parked on the same street corner where he was standing, cops said. The male got out of the car, opened fire and fled.

A 23-year-old woman sustained a 'graze wound' in what police believe was an attempted drive by shooting around 5.30 a.m. on the South Side. She refused medical treatment at the scene, police told WMAQ.

No arrests have been made in any of the shootings.
