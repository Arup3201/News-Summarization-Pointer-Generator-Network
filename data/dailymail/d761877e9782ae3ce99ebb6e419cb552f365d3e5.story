Paris has banned action movies being filmed in and around the city over concerns that locals could mistake the actors for genuine terrorists following last month's Charlie Hebdo massacre.

Filming outdoor scenes with police, army or security services was quietly banned in the aftermath of the attacks in the French capital that left 17 dead, along with the three gunmen.

Police officials responsible for granting permission for outdoor filming in the city said the ban is intended to prevent passers-by confusing chase scenes for authentic police incidents - and may even prevent actors and crew becoming an easy target for terror attacks themselves.

Speaking of the decision to ban action movies, Sylvie Barnaud, the police official who grants outside filming permission in Paris, said: 'There's a problem with these action-type scenes, as the actors in uniform could be targets for terrorists.'

'Also, the actors could pose confusion for the general public during this highly sensitive period.'

She did not know how long the ban could last, but there was not indication it would be reversed anytime soon.

Tensions remain high in Paris, with armed police and soldiers still posted outside sensitive sites, including synagogues, media offices and major shopping areas.

Earlier this week French counter-terrorism identified 64 suburbs in dozens of cities that act as breeding grounds for Islamic extremism.

The French government has been ridiculed for producing a poster to help identify potential jihadists - with one suggestion that giving up baguettes is a telltale sign.

They claim pointers that someone is being radicalised by Islamist fanatics include alarm bells such as losing interest in sports, rejecting family members and changing eating habits.

The poster was launched as part of a new £320million campaign to counter terrorism in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks.

But the attempt to inform the public backfired, with many ridiculing the Stop Jihadism poster for the suggestions it made.

So-called 'ghettos' with high rates of youth unemployment, immigration and single-parent families, such as L'Ariane near Nice, have been linked to the radicalisation of young and vulnerable people. 

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls last month admitted that the country had collapsed into social and ethnic 'apartheid' - the first time a senior politician has conceded that economic marginalisation and religious tensions have led to serious divides. 

Paris has long been a favored filming location, especially for chase scenes that feature some of the world's most recognizable landmarks.

Luc Besson's 2014 box-office hit 'Lucy' with Scarlett Johansson features a police chase next to the Louvre - something impossible under the new rules.

The same may have been true of 2014's blockbuster 'Edge of Tomorrow,' which was partly filmed in the French capital, staring Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise.

Several productions have already been disrupted — included one called 'Flics Tout Simplement' ('Simply Cops,') which was supposed to have a scene with a police officer outside a school. 

Scenes with religious sites or schools, both protected under the emergency security plans, are also banned.

'Yes, we were meant to film this scene. But it wasn't allowed. Of course, we have to respect the new rules, and we changed the production plan,' said the film unit director Stephan Guillemet.

Paris is holding its annual Film Set Fair this week, hoping that it will continue to attract big productions.

It trumpets giving the green light to 1,159 film productions in the capital last year alone.

'It could have an impact on the big American productions ... It's not the right moment to do it,' said Agnes Naggeotte of the Cinema Mission of the City of Paris. 

'Even if Steven Spielberg wanted to film a big scene with police and a shoot-out in the streets in January I'm sure it would not have got made,' she added.

French authorities are investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video titled Blow Up France 2 may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist- a source has claimed.

The footage, released by French-speaking ISIS fighters on Tuesday, shows masked jihadists praising the attacks on Paris last month and calling on Muslims to carry out further terror attacks in France.

In a chilling statement to camera, the terrorist says: 'Don’t give up and particularly don’t lower your weapons, don’t surrender, kill.'

'Today it’s our darwa, kill them, you now have more than 4 million targets.' 

A source close to the French investigation into the kosher deli attacks told CNN that authorities in France believe that the woman who appears in the video wearing camouflage clothing and holding a weapon could be Hayat Boumeddiene.

Boumeddiene is the wife of Amedy Coulibaly, the Islamist gunman who killed four hostages at the kosher Hyper Cacher market in the eastern part of the French capital on January 9.

He was killed by police following an hours-long standoff.  

Authorities are searching for Boumeddiene, who is also believed to have been a co-conspirator in attack. She is currently thought to be in Syria.
