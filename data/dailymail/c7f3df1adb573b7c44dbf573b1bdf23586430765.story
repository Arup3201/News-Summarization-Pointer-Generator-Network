One of the stabbing victims was 16-year-old Deavean Bazile, who was taken to a hospital by airlifted by LifeFlight medical helicopter to Memorial Hermann-The Texas Medical Center in critical condition, which has since been upgraded to good condition, according to his father, MyFox Houston reported.

School district officials have canceled classes at the high school for the rest of the week.

One adult was seen being carried from the school in a stretcher to an ambulance. He appeared conscious and sitting up.

At least three male suspects were taken in for questioning by deputies outside the campus.

Parents have expressed frustration with the school district, claiming that officials have not been forthcoming with information, and it took the school too long to send out notification about the emergency.

Police officers said that parents of students directly involved in the fight already had been notified, and others need not worry for their children’s safety.
