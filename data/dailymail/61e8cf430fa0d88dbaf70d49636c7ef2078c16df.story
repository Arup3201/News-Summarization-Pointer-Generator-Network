'Tragic accident': Plumber Sam Hill, 22, was killed after falling two metres from his hotel balcony while suffering from tinnitus

A young man was killed after falling just two metres from a hotel balcony, having lost his balance because he was suffering from tinnitus, an inquest heard.

Plumber Sam Hill, 22, had been on a night out with a friend in Magaluf on September 11 last year when he fell from the emergency escape balcony at the Hostal Villa de Sol.

At an inquest in Bradford, West Yorks, Coroner Sam Cariss gave a verdict of accidental death caused by head injuries - and attributed the fall to a combination of Mr Hill’s tinnitus and the alcohol he’d consumed with his friend.

The coroner said: 'What we can assume happened is that Sam, due to his tinnitus, had overbalanced on the balcony and fell.'

Referring to his relatively short plunge, he added: 'His skull was thinner than most people’s.'

He added to Mr Hill’s family, who sat in court: 'He would have had to overbalance over the balcony. This is just a tragic accident.'

The court heard that Mr Hill’s sense of balance was skewed due to his condition, which he had seen a GP over just days before his holiday.

Sam was prescribed antibiotics, which the coroner acknowledged may have reacted badly with the alcohol he and his friend drank during their holiday.

The inquest heard that Mr Hill, of Riddlesden, West Yorks., had been on a night out with his friend Roland Sands when they lost each other.

He walked back to his hotel alone - but 
ten minutes later was found dead by Alexander Campbell, a British 
national on holiday who was listening to music in the next room and 
heard someone fall, the court heard.

Gareth Elms, a British policeman also on holiday, had seen Mr Hill with his head on the grass.

The inquest heard that Mr Elms moved Mr Hill to the first floor hallway and carried out CPR, before calling for an ambulance - but there was no sign of a pulse.

When paramedics arrived, they pronounced Sam dead - as his friend arrived back at the hotel.The young plumber had been due to fly home later that day.

Mr Cariss added that this had been 'a loss of life too early.'

'I can only try to imagine how difficult this has been for you,' he said to Sam’s parents Vanessa and Steve, brother Tom and girlfriend Jodie Corbett. 'I wish you well as you treasure memories of happier times.'

Mr Hill's father Steve said after the inquest: 'He was just a lovely man with a great life ahead of him, sadly cut short.

'He will be greatly missed.'
