West Ham United are preparing a move to sign Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher - but are likely to face competition from West Bromwich Albion.

The Scotland international, who has six months left on his contract at Old Trafford, is expected to move on in order to gain more regular football as he has only made 16 appearances this season, the last of which was against Yeovil Town in the FA Cup.

That has alerted Sam Allardyce, who is a keen admirer of the 30-year-old and wants to bring Fletcher to Upton Park to provide experience, as West Ham chase the dream of having European football when they move to the Olympic Stadium.

West Ham have space on their wage bill to add Fletcher, having just released Portuguese forward Ricardo Vaz Te; Allardyce is not expected to make too many additions to his squad during this window but the chance to sign Fletcher is something he would jump at.

There is plenty of interest in Fletcher, however. Valencia and Celtic have made enquiries about Fletcher, who had made 340 appearances during his United career, winning the Champions League, the Barclays Premier League on five occasions, as well as 66 Scotland caps.

West Brom are also understood to have ambitions of signing Fletcher, who has accepted that his opportunities to play for Louis van Gaal are going to decrease as he continues to overhaul United’s squad in the future.

A move to The Hawthorns might be attractive from a personal point of view as Fletcher would not necessarily have to leave home. He is expected to make his decision over the next fortnight.
