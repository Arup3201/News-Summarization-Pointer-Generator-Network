Fears that the general election will result in political paralysis is the biggest threat to business this year, a survey of City bosses has found.

The Financial Times survey of some of the biggest names in the City of London even uncovered fears an unclear outcome to the election could even endanger the recovery.

Many election pundits have long predicted that the election will result in another hung parliament, with neither the Tories nor Labour with enough MPs to command a majority in the House of Commons.

Instead, the party with the largest number of seats is likely to be forced to cobble together a coalition deal with at least one other party.

Some pundits have predicted that if the outcome is particularly tight, a ‘rainbow coalition’ could be required involving at least three parties.

The FT reported that Sir Win Bischoff, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, warned of a ‘year of great anxiety and worry.

Dame Alison Carnwath warned about ‘an inconclusive election, the ghastly possibility of a second general election and a possible EU referendum.’

The concerns emerged in an online debate about the risks facing firms in 2015.

Risk: City of London powerhouses have branded the election an 'Ed Miliband risk more than a Labour risk'

Several bosses pointed to concerns about Labour’s business and taxation policies, while others said hostility to immigration among Tories could affect them.

Guy Hands, the chief executive of private equity firm Terra Firma said: ‘I think the biggest risk for the City this year is the political uncertainty that would be created by an inconclusive general election.’

‘Labour will do too badly to form a government. We could very easily have a second election in October. If Labour do get into power I would be very concerned about punitive attacks on the City.

He warned: ‘We could see the sort of tax rises that would have other international financial centres rubbing their hands in glee.’

Manny Roman, chief executive of investment management firm Man Group said: I think it is very straightforward: The UK election is a real risk. The Labour party is seen as very anti-business and investors will fear a repeat of Hollande.

He added: ‘This is an Ed Miliband risk more than a Labour risk. Obviously any weak government is also a problem.’
