A catastrophic Vodafone technical fault shut down a raft of key phone services including police and NHS hotlines - and even RAC breakdown recovery, Barclays bank and First Great Western.

Problems were first reported at about 9am this morning when callers were unable to reach the police non-emergency 101 number and NHS 24's medical advice line.

But customers stranded at the roadside were also unable to get through to RAC and those with queries about trains were also stuck when trying to get through on the phone. 

A major technical fault by phone operator Vodafone left people unable to contact police and NHS hotlines

Engineers spent hours working to resolve the issue and initially anticipated that it could take several hours to fix but worked on it as a 'matter of priority' and most lines were up and running by 1pm. 

A spokesperson from Vodafone said: 'We can confirm that this morning an issue with one of our fixed line call routing systems temporarily affected the services we provide to a number of organisations. 

'However, our engineers have worked hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and services have now been restored. 

'We will continue to monitor the service closely and will be carrying out a full investigation into the issue. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.' 

Anglian Water, which was also affected, tweeted that the issue was at a Birmingham exchange and had been causing intermittent faults.

Staff at RAC Breakdown advised people to email them their details and brief location and also said they would drive around to see if anyone was stranded.

Humberside Police tweeted earlier this morning to inform members of the public that the number was down

Metropolitan Police also advised people to visit a local station or use the online form to report crime

They tweeted: 'Patrols are driving the busiest routes in their areas to look out for anyone broken down to see if we can help.' 

The recovery firm added: 'Vodafone suffered a catastrophic failure to its telephone equipment this am which is affecting many large businesses who use their services.' 

While Barclays bank also posted on Twitter that their customers were experience issues on the phone lines due to the Vodafone outage.

The problem affected at least 23 police forces and people were advised that the 999 system had not been affected - but should only be used in the case of an emergency.

Humberside Police tweeted: 'We can confirm that 101 is not working nationally. Fault lies with some kit in Birmingham which is being worked on.' 

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We are working with our service provider to rectify this issue as soon as possible.'

RAC Breakdown customers were also affected by the outage after lines went down and they were unable to contact the company if they were stranded by the roadside. It asked drivers to email in instead

Several affected forces offered alternative numbers or directed people to their websites or local police stations.

A spokesman for Dorset Police said: 'Until the problem is fixed members of the public should use 01202/ 01305 222222 for non-emergency calls.'

Hertfordshire Police offered the following numbers for reporting non-emergencies: 01707 354000 if in Hertfordshire, 01234 841212 for those in Bedfordshire and 01480 456111 for people in Cambridgeshire.

Suffolk police said in a statement: 'Whilst this issue is being resolved, members of the public who need to contact Suffolk Police with non-urgent matters should dial 01473 613500.

'999 should continue to be used in the event of an emergency.'

North Yorkshire Police tweeted: 'There is a national issue with our non-emergency 101 line and unfortunately it is off service until further notice. 999 is still fine.' 

The Metropolitan Police said non-emergency crime could be reported online at www.met.police.uk

While NHS officials said some callers were also experiencing problems and were unable to get through to new medical advice line via the 111 number.

Those seeking medical advice were advised to call an alternative number while engineers work to resolve issue

Members of the public were offered alternative numbers or advised if their condition was life-threatening they should call 999.

NHS England tweeted at about 12.45pm: 'NHS 111 is now working normally a previous technical issue has been resolved the public should use the service as normal.' 

The new freephone 111 number was launched in Scotland in April.

At the time, ministers said the change made the number easy to remember, while the introduction of the free-to-call service removed any barrier to the public accessing the health advice out of hours.
