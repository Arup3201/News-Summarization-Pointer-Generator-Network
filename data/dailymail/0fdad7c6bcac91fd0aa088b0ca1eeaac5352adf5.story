 A 75-year-old Virginia woman choked a raccoon to death after the rabid animal bit her on the leg.

Cas Overton, of Henrico County near Richmond, was walking through the Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens and looking at birds when she was confronted with the aggressive mammal.

She tried to shake it off unsuccessfully, and strangled the animal around the neck for five minutes after realizing how violent it was.

'You know self-preservation kicks in, and I guess a primitive part of my brain just went into operation and that was it,' she told the Richmond Times Dispatch.

'If I ran, it would be faster than I would and would just tear me to pieces,' Ms Overton, who was a Tai Chi instructor for 40 years, said.

The septuagenarian was taken to the hospital after the Saturday incident on one of the gardens' backroads, and has received multiple preventative vaccines for rabies since.

Tests later confirmed that the animal carried the disease, according to ABC8.

Ms Overton said it 'took a while' to figure out that she had killed her attacker, and that she is an animal lover who has been walking in the gardens for 30 years.

The Humane Society says that raccoons suffer most from rabies in the eastern US, making up more than a third of all animals rabies cases.

Both raccoons and skunks, another common rabies carrier, are nocturnal. Activity during the day is an abnormal behavior that could indicate the presence of the disease.

Pets such as dogs are particularly vulnerable to rabies, which is a nervous system disease only transmitted by saliva.

Animal owners are urged to vaccinate their pets to stop the spread of the disease in the event of a wild animal attack.
