Cedric Bartee was critically wounded after being shot by Sergeant Robert McCarthy on Monday night

A Florida sheriff has asked state police to open a criminal investigation after a 28-year-old unarmed black man in a stolen car was shot and critically wounded early on Monday by a white officer.

Witnesses report that the man, who has been named as Cedric Bartee, had his hands up when he was shot.

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings called for calm and said he was determined to be as transparent as possible in light of amid racially charged protests nationwide about police violence. 

'I ask everyone to not rush to judgment and allow the
investigation to be completed,' he said at a news conference in Orlando.

Demings, who himself is African American and was surrounded
by six religious leaders from the black community, said
investigators have found some eyewitness accounts that conflict
with that of the officer involved.

Witnesses at the apartment complex said that the men had
their hands up when the deputy opened fire, according to local
media reports.

Cities across the United States have seen major protests in
recent days after grand juries declined to indict anyone in the
deaths of two unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of white police
officers in New York and Ferguson, Missouri.

After locating a stolen car at an apartment complex just
after midnight on Monday, Sergeant Robert McCarthy fired three
shots, one of which hit Cedric Bartee.

Demings said Bartee failed to comply with McCarthy's
commands and 'made extensive furtive movements,' making the
deputy fear for his safety.

Bartee underwent surgery and was in stable but critical
condition late in the afternoon, the sheriff said. A second man
in the car was arrested unhurt.

The shooting also comes only a few days after a 32-year-old
Latino man was shot and killed in a car by an Orlando detective
investigating a burglary. Police said the detective opened fire
after he saw Alejandro Noel Cordero had a gun.

On Monday Demings said he was trying to be transparent in
holding the press conference 'because of the backdrop of
everything happening in the country at this time.'

He added: 'It's concerning to me' how the public might
react.

Bartee had a history of arrests on at least 45 charges since
1999, according to a list provided by the sheriff, but the
deputy was not aware of his background at the time of the
shooting, Demings said.

McCarthy has been reassigned to administrative duties for at
least a week, and the shooting is being investigated by the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement as part of a standard
procedure. 

The FDLE is also investigating Cordero's shooting.

Black and white religious and community leaders from Orange County, Florida, spoke at Monday's press conference to appeal for calm
