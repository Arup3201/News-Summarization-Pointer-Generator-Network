A mob of 50 furious Italians stormed a Roma camp outside Naples after a girl suffered an alleged attempted rape by two gypsies.

Dozens of Neapolitans laid siege to the camp, pelting residents with rocks before being restrained by the police. 

The following day dozens of the inhabitants of the Poggioreale site, on the eastern outskirts of Naples, decamped.

A Roma gypsy camp just outside Naples was attacked after a young Italian girl claimed that she had been attacked by two members of the community

The camp was just on the outskirts of the city of Naples, the third largest city in Italy - in 2010, eighteen mafia suspects were arrested for a suspected arson attack on the camp

Entire families fled the site in vans, apparently fearing further attacks.

A 16-year old Italian girl had returned home in a state of agitation, complaining of the alleged attack by two Roma, around 9pm on Tuesday night.

She was taken to hospital in a state of shock.

Relatives of the girl headed for the camp with the intention of ‘punishing’ the perpetrators, before exchanging blows with Roma, leaving them injured.

The Roma Gypsy camp just outside of Naples had already come under fire from critics because of claims that it was unhygienic

But hours later they returned, flanked by the vigilante mob, threatening fires and launching rocks at the campsite.

The site's 250 inhabitants were forced to put up road blocks to defend themselves, and the police eventually managed to restore order.

The camp, which has been in that location for four years has already been the focus of protests by locals because of poor hygiene conditions.

In 2010 police arrested 18 mafia suspects over an arson attack on the encampment. In January the mayor ordered the camp's removal.

Municipal leader Armando Coppola said the girl had suffered an attempted rape but had managed to escape. 

He added: 'Residents have already had to put up with thefts and obscene acts by the gypsies who are inclined to urinate in the street.

'But this episode triggered a violent reaction.

'I have requested the council to order the immediate eviction of the camp.

'Otherwise the justifiable exasperation of the citizens of Poggioreale will no longer be controllable.'
