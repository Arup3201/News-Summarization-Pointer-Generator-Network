A priceless 300-year-old tapestry depicting the ‘finest hour’ of Winston Churchill’s most illustrious ancestor has undergone a major restoration for the first time.

The work of art hangs at Blenheim Palace and tells the story of the 1st Duke of Marlborough’s victories over the French in the War of the Spanish Succession.

The Duke, John Churchill, was a brilliant military strategist and much like Winston Churchill two centuries later, led an Allied force to victory in Europe.

The outcome of the war is considered a turning point in history, signalling the end of France’s ambitions to rule Europe at the time.

To mark his achievement the duke commissioned 10 incredibly detailed tapestries to be made.

The giant wall hangings, 25ft wide and 15ft tall, are made of wool and silk and were woven in the Brussels workshop of the Flemish weaver, Judocus de Vos.

The most significant work is the Bouchain III tapestry depicting the French surrender to the duke.

It has now been subjected to a painstaking £60,000 restoration and has been cleaned and conserved for future generations.

Kate Ballenger, the house manager at Blenheim Palace, the ancestral home of the Churchills, said: ‘The tapestry was taken to a team of restoration experts based in Brussels – the same city where it was made.

‘After being unpacked, and following a thorough examination, it was submerged in a large bath and gently washed to remove the dirt.

‘There were a number of splits in the sky as well as silk loss in several sections. These were repaired and a new support was added to the back to strengthen the wool and silk.

‘The tapestry had also been previously hung on poppers but these were removed and replaced with Velcro to enable quick and safe removal in case of emergency.

‘These tapestries are an extraordinary record of an historic military victory which had a crucial effect both on Europe and the rest of the world, as well as stunning works of art.

‘This essential restoration work is returning them to their former glory and helping to protect them for future generations to enjoy.’

The series of tapestries are collectively known as The Victories of the Duke of Marlborough and took eight years to make, from between 1709 to 1717.

They were commissioned by the duke to celebrate his victory over rival Louis XIV in a series of battles, including the Battle of Blenheim in Bavaria in 1704.

At the time the victory was hailed as the greatest British military success since Agincourt, with Sir Winston Churchill later saying it changed the ‘political axis of the world’.

A grateful nation built Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire to recognise the duke’s achievements.

The tapestries are the most accurate and detailed contemporary records that exist of the campaign, not least because the duke provided accurate battle plans and portraits of the principal characters.

They were removed from Blenheim Palace’s second state room before being rolled up and transported to Belgium for renovation.

Eventually, all 10 panels will be removed, cleaned and repaired in the same way at a cost of more than £500,000.

John Churchill, the 1st duke of Marlborough, was born at Devon in November 1650 and his father was called Sir Winston Churchill who was a Cavalier during the Civil War.

John became an ensign in the regiment that became the Grenadier Guards.

He fought bravely in the Battle of Sole Bay in May 1672 but despite being recommended for a promotion by the Duke of York (the future King James II), it was initially denied on the orders of his brother King Charles II, it is thought because Churchill, a ladies’ man, was sleeping with the king’s mistress. Churchill became a captain a month later.

A gallant soldier, Churchill took part in many campaigns fighting at Maastricht and Strasbourg before being appointed an aide to the Duke of York.

Through marriage and various machinations, Churchill became a wealthy man. In 1679, he was elected MP for Newtown, Isle of Wight. The following year he became the Duke of York’s principal adviser. In 1682 in recognition of this Charles ennobled him as Lord Churchill of Eyemouth.

Churchill and his wife lived in St James’s Palace and then the Palace of Whitehall. He became MP for St Albans. When James II became king Churchill was appointed ambassador-extraordinary to France and then Baron Churchill of Sandridge.

In 1688, Churchill switched allegiance to William of Orange as James fled England in the Glorious Revolution. William told Churchill to re-form the Army in advance of the impending war with France. Two days before William and Mary’s coronation they created him Earl of Marlborough.

He later became commander-in-chief of the Army in England. However, in 1792 after it was discovered that he was in contact with James II, Churchill was sacked by the king. Things worsened and he was sent to the Tower of London, on suspicion of high treason. He was released after six weeks.

On William’s death, Queen Anne came to the throne and Churchill became one of the most important men in English military and diplomatic affairs in the period 1702-1710.

Churchill commanded the Allied forces in the War of the Spanish Succession. As a reward Queen Anne created him Marquess of Blandford and Duke of Marlborough and an income of £5,000 a year for her lifetime (later extended to his lifetime).

It was at the Battle of Blenheim that Marlborough showed his tactical genius defeating the Franco-Bavarian army – the first time in 40 years the French suffered a major defeat.

As a reward in 1705 Anne gave him the former royal manor of Woodstock, which produced revenues of £6,000 a year. A house was built at Woodstock was the duke’s family seat and a national memorial for the battle.

Parliament examined the costs and with a major war being fought tried to cut back on the project but despite the austerity measures Marlborough would have none of it and insisted that building went ahead. He also insisted that his titles be passed on to his daughters, his sons having predeceased him.

The Duke of Marlborough died in June 1722. A full state funeral took place on August 9, 1722. He left an estate worth about £1,000,000.

In 1933 to 1938 his descendant Winston Churchill wrote a four-volume biography of him.
