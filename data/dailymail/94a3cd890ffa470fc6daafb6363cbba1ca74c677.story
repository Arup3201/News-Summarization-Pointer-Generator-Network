Oklahoma residents fear that hooded sweatshirts may soon be illegal to wear in public.

There is currently a law banning wearing hoods while committing crimes that's been around since the 1920s but an amendment proposed by Senator Don Barrington may make wearing them illegal in public altogether.

Oklahomans who wear a hood in public may be forced to fork over a $500 fine.

KFOR reports that a law banning hoods was originally written to help fight Klux-Klux-Klan associated crimes.

Barrington states he believes wearing a hoods aids in all types of crimes and seeks to pass the amendment to protect the community.

'The intent of Senate Bill 13 is to make businesses and public places safer by ensuring that people cannot conceal their identities for the purpose of crime or harassment….

Similar language has been in Oklahoma statutes for decades and numerous other states have similar laws in place. Oklahoma businesses want state leaders to be responsive to their safety concerns, and this is one way we can provide protection.' – said Sen. Don Barrington of Lawton.

Despite Barrington's good intentions, some residents feel as though their rights are being stripped away from them one clothing item at a time.

They argue that hoodies are functional and fashionable items of clothing used to keep people warm and dry in nasty weather.

'If somebody is out running, especially in this kind of weather, where it`s cold, drizzly, you might be inclined to wear your hoodie at Lake Hefner,' attorney James Siderias said.

'I think this is a violation of an individual’s right to chose what they want to wear as long as it doesn’t violate the realm of public decency and moral values, and I think this could be very problematic,' Siderias added.

KFOR spoke with resident Tracy Wehagen who said someone may want to wear a hoodie for a deeply personal reason and that they should be able to sport the protective gear.

'They might have personal issues for keeping them on; they might have a bad hair day or maybe they have cancer or they’re losing their hair. You just don’t know why,' Tracy Wehagen said.

Even though the provision would allow hoods to be worn for religious purposes, parades, costume parties, and even in cold weather, people fear it may be difficult to prove what purpose they are wearing it for.
