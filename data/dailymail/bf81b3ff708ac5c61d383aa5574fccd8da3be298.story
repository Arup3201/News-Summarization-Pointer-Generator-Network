Europe’s banker foursomes pairing of Ian Poulter and Justin Rose had already trampled on American opposition before the start of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles on Friday morning.

The English duo have designed their first course together at China’s Mission Hills Shenzhen-Dongguan, just across the border from Hong Kong, which has 12 courses.

The new Rose-Poulter course, which opens next month, is set up for matchplay. It is a complete re-design of the previously named David Duval course, which has been consigned to the deep rough.

Mission Hills name the courses after their famous golfing designers, such as Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Nick Faldo, Ernie Els and Jose Maria Olazabal. But it was felt that former world No 1 Duval, a Ryder Cup player in 1999 and 2001, had fallen too far off the golfing map. His design wasn’t considered a good one, either.

Rose and Poulter will officially open their course on October 28 with a singles matchplay. The winner is to receive a luxury flat on the Missions Hills complex.

All week in the captains’ press conferences, Europe’s Paul McGinley has come across as the more assured leader. But after the pairings were announced on Thursday, it was noticeable the USA’s Tom Watson suddenly looked the more confident.

The chances of traffic meltdown around Gleneagles this morning, with 45,000 spectators arriving in the dark to be there for that iconic first tee shot at 7.35am, are more likely than an Ian Poulter fist pump, such has been the shambolic transport planning.

It reached the ludicrous situation on Thursday of the driver of a media bus adding to an already lengthy one-and-a-half hour journey from Glasgow by stopping in a Marks & Spencer car park for a 30-minute rest because he had exceeded his designated hours.

Byrom, who run Ryder Cup travel services, pass the buck and said they were only one of a number of agencies involved in the transport blueprint and they had sub-contracted the botched bus service.

The merchandising tent at Gleneagles is doing better business than the one at Celtic Manor in 2010, although it is nowhere near as big as the Medinah operation, which made more than £10m in three days of frenzied trading. This follows retail specialists Kitbag taking over the running from marketing agents IMG after a tender. Kitbag’s online business has also seen 5,000 commemorative Ryder Cup £5 notes sold for £20 each. 

Stars sidelined at gig

The music at the Ryder Cup gala concert in Glasgow was considered top drawer but those who went to the event principally to see the golfers introduced to the crowd would have felt very short-changed.

There was only 20 minutes allocated for the players in the Hydro Arena proceedings and they were rushed through the ceremony, with only brief words from the two captains.

Dull Scottish radio presenter Fred MacAuley, who had great trouble recognising who was who, announced one competitor and partner just as another couple was walking on to the stage.

This diluted the marvellous reception given to both sides, with not a moment allowed to soak up the special applause, especially loud for Tom Watson and local boy Stephen Gallacher.

Even the European team, who had complained about the length of their stay at the concert in Chicago, felt they should have been on stage longer to make it more of an occasion. 

Phil Mickelson’s barb about Rory Mcllroy and Graeme McDowell ‘litigating’ against each other has not affected the harmony within Team Europe. But there has been some discord behind the scenes with Scotland’s Paul Lawrie, who played in 2012, very upset he wasn’t picked as a vice-captain when the event is being staged on his home soil. Paul McGinley preferred Spain’s Miguel Angel Jimenez and Jose Maria Olazabal. However, Lawrie did tweet during the opening ceremony: ‘Fantastic speech from captain Paul, well done.’
