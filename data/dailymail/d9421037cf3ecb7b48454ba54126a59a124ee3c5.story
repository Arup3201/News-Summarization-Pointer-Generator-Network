The parents of a British hotelier murdered by a hitman on the Caribbean island of St Lucia have put up a £60,000 reward in a last ditch attempt to try and find his killers.

The badly burnt body of 38-year-old Oliver Gobat was found on the idyllic island in April. He had been shot twice in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of his Range Rover before the vehicle - with his body inside it - was torched.

But the local police investigation into the suspected contract killing has now stalled and British police are refusing to assist because the Commonwealth country of St Lucia retains the death penalty for murder.

Mr Gobat's parents Theo and Helen Gobat have responded by launching a private investigation headed by a former member of of the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency, The Times reported.

Mrs Gobat said: 'Getting justice for Ollie is like pushing water uphill. Unless we get an outside police force in, we face a big challenge.

'I'd like to see the evil people who brought this upon Ollie brought to justice, for our sake, for Ollie's sake and for St Lucia's sake.'

The couple now live under constant security protection, and are offering a £60,000 reward for leads or information on their son's death, the paper reported.

The manner of Mr Gobat’s death, on a remote track a mile from the upmarket Cap Maison hotel he ran in the north of the island, has led police to believe he was the victim of a contract killing.

Police sources previously stated Mr Gobat’s death was ‘no ordinary murder’ and it had ‘all the hallmarks of a professional killing’.

As the family's investigation has been subjected to intimidation and death threats, it's now considered Mr Gobat's business dealings had caused problems within the Caribbean's criminal underworld, leading to his death.

A theory previously considered by police is that money he was using to finance a new hotel development came from a drugs gang who were using the legitimate business to launder their cash. 

When that deal failed to materialise, they demanded their money back. Mr Gobat was unable to pay so they had him killed.

Cap Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, was created by the Gobats with their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver.

Guests, who have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa.

Theo Gobat, 75, was born in Chester and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt.

He and another director successfully took over the company’s hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison.

His son Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and fitness club in Adelaide, Australia.
