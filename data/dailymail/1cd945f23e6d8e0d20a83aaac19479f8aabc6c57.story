Former Prime Minister John Howard has slammed actress Cate Blanchett over the 'outrageous' speech she made at Gough Whitlam's state memorial service.

The Oscar-winning actress was one of several speakers at the late former prime minister's memorial, where she praised Whitlam for introducing free university education and health care.

'I am the beneficiary of free, tertiary education,' Blanchett said.

'When I went to university I could explore different courses and engage with the student union in extracurricular activity.

'It was through that that I discovered acting.'

But Mr Howard has hit out at Blanchett and refuted her claim that Whitlam was responsible for making education free, the Herald Sun reported.

'That speech of Cate Blanchett's was outrageous. Cate Blanchett is a talented actor, I admire her talent, but to suggest that Whitlam introduced free university education is wrong,' he said.

Mr Howard said he received a university scholarship for three years, 11 years before Whitlam came to power

Mr Howard said he went to university in the 1950s and 1960s and received a scholarship for three of the years he studied, 11 years before Whitlam became prime minister in 1972.

Mr Howard said he won the scholarship when his marks improved, and he took the place of someone whose marks had slipped.

'The last three years of my university education were completely free and that was 11 years before Whitlam came to power,' he said.

'This idea that it just arrived (with Whitlam) is complete nonsense and it ought to be called out more frequently.'

Blanchett said the opportunities given to her through free university education led her to become an actress

Mr Howard said Commonwealth scholarships paid for 70 per cent of students' tuition fees before Whitlam came to power.

In her speech last month, Blanchett said that while she wasn't even in school by the time his prime ministership ended, she is the beneficiary of his legacy.

'I am the product of an Australia that wanted, and was encouraged, to explore its voice culturally,' she said.

'I am the beneficiary of good, free healthcare, and that meant the little I earned after tax and rent could go towards seeing shows, bands, and living inside my generation's expression.'
