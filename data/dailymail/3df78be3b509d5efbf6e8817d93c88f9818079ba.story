The French air traffic strike, that ground Europe to a halt, causing hundreds of flight cancellations and stranding tens of thousands of holidaymakers, has finally been called off.

Hundreds of flights to France, Spain and Portugal were grounded as peak holiday season kicked off, due to the closure of French airspace, causing huge delays across Europe and leaving airports overflowing.

But after two days of the six-day strike, air traffic controllers said they would end the industrial action early because the French government had recognised the 'importance of investment in the sector'.

Delays: Passengers at Stansted Airport faced delays as striking French air traffic controllers caused chaos across Europe, causing delays and cancellations for flights to France, Spain and Portugal

The news comes after many holidaymakers were forced to sleep on the floors of 
airports in Mediterranean resorts as they awaited news of rescheduled 
flights.

British passengers reported 'nightmare' scenes at popular holiday destinations in Spain and Portugal as flights were cancelled with no warning, due to French airspace being closed.

Frustrated travellers took to Twitter to vent their anger, with passengers claiming they were not given enough help by airlines when their flights were cancelled.

Aileen O'Toole complained that her daughter was charged £144 when she tried to rebook a flight to Malaga that had been cancelled due to the strike - despite Ryanair claiming passengers could rebook 'free of charge'.

The budget airline has now confirmed that a refund has been issued.

In agreement: Abby Benson voiced opinions very similar to those expressed by Ryanair

Other passengers also complained about their treatment at the hands of airlines.

Abby Benson said her daughter had been sat in a plane on the tarmac from 9pm, with a 4.30am take-off expected, but that there was no water being offered to passengers.

Ryanair and easyJet, who had first predicted 'dozens' of cancellations on day one of the strike, were forced to ground 260 and 150 flights respectively yesterday.

And
 to add further misery to the European travel chaos, Belgian air traffic
 controllers also joined the French walkout before the industrial action was called off.

Long wait: Thousands of travellers are now waiting to hear when they will be able to make their journeys after the six-day strike was cut short

Passengers, who have already 
experienced days of delays, are now waiting to hear whether they will be
 able to return home or head off on holiday now that the strike has 
ended.

Student Ellis Palmer has already spent more than 24 hours attempting to get to Barcelona for a university course.

The
 19-year-old initially had a flight from Liverpool cancelled, before 
being sent to Manchester for an alternative flight where he sat on the 
runway for 90 minutes before being told to disembark.

Ellis told MailOnline Travel: ‘Ryanair have rebooked my flight for a third time now.'

EasyJet, which cancelled 300 
flights over two days, said it had booked 2,800 hotel rooms to deal with
 passengers unable to fly home. And British Airways cancelled 30 flights in total. 

Kenny

 Jacobs, marketing chief at Ryanair, had accused to French air traffic 
controllers of holding holidaymakers to ransom and said EU governments 
needed to get 
tough on the striking workers.

‘It’s
 a disgrace,’ he said. ‘The French need to sort this out. Ronald Reagan 
had the right idea when he broke the air traffic controllers’ strike in 
the USA by sending in the military to run it.

‘Strike
 action by air traffic controllers should be made illegal. And if they 
do go on strike, neighbouring EU countries should be able to operate the
 airspace over France to keep planes flying.’

Queues at UK airports were less severe 
than on Tuesday because airlines had ‘pre-cancelled’ most of the 
affected outbound flights overnight and alerted passengers in advance by
 text or email.

While holidaymakers had been expecting flight cancellations to France, huge delays also affected routes to Spain and Portugal.

Top dance acts Chase and Status and Magnetic Man's Artwork were among the celebrities affected by the strike.

Both were due to perform at Ibiza's Amnesia nightclub but were unable to travel.

Angry
 Artwork told fans on Twitter: 'So, missed going to Amnesia Ibiza 
tonight due to the folks at French air traffic control .... F*** you!'

The strike was over job cuts as part of an EU plan for a ‘single European sky’.
