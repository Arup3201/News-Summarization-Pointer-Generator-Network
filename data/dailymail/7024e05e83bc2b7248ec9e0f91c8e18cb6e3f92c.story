The mystery over which congressman called New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand 'chubby' was seemingly solved this morning.

The New York Times outed late Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye, a Democrat, as the man who made the offensive comment in the inaugural edition of it's political newsletter.

A spokesman for Gillibrand, who is also a Democrat, didn't confirm that Inouye was the unnamed colleague who the 47-year-old female Senator referred to in her recently released memoir but he didn't deny it was Inouye, either.

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat, asks questions at a Senate Armed Services hearing last week in Washington, D.C. Gillibrand has attracted attention over her claim that a male colleague called her 'chubby' after the birth of her second son 

Today the New York Times announced that late Hawaii Sen. Daniel Inouye, also a Democrat, was the culprit

Inouye, a World War II veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, died in 2012. At the time of his death, President Barack Obama called him a 'true American hero' and said he was 'revered by all of us lucky enough to know him.'

But as the Times points out, Inouye may not have been Boy Scout.

In 1992 Inouye's former hairdresser claimed the senator made her have sex with him. The same year a Hawaii state senator accused Inouye of sexually harassing nine other women who wished to remain anonymous.

The Times said today that sources familiar with the Gillibrand incident claim Inouye was the cheeky male colleague who told the female Senator after she had her second son, 'Don’t lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby!'

Gillibrand served with Inouye in the Senate from 2009 until his death two years ago.

Gillibrand first made the claim that a male colleague called her 'chubby' in her memoir, released last month

While Gillibrand's office wouldn't tell the Times if Inouye was indeed the culprit, Gillibrand described the man who made the remark  as 'one of my favorite older members of the Senate' in her recently released memoir, Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World.

Conservative pundits inferred from the statement that Gillibrand was likely referring to a fellow a Democrat, which is why she didn't want to name names. The Times' reporting suggests they may have been right.

It still remains a secret which congressman called Gillibrand 'porky' and which lawmaker told her 'you're even pretty when you're fat.'

The only clues Gillibrand has offered to their perpetrators' identities is that they were older men.

'It was all statements that were being made by men who were well into their 60s, 70s or 80s,' she told People magazine last month. 'They had no clue that those are inappropriate things to say to a pregnant woman or a woman who just had a baby or to women in general.'
