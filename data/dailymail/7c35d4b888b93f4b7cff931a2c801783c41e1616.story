A sinkhole that opened up early Thursday morning in Dunedin, Florida could have been prevented.

Michael Dupre, whose home was one of two condemned yesterday, had known for two years that a sinkhole was was growing underneath his home but had been battling with his insurance company to get lasting repairs.

Today, his home and one other will be demolished and covered with 600 dump truck loads of dirt to stabilize the hole.

Growing: The sinkhole that opened up between two homes in Dunedin, Florida early Thursday morning has grown to 90-feet-wide and nearly 60-feet deep. Aerial footage shows the view from above the sinkhole this morning

Too late: Michael Dupre is the owner of 1112 Robmar Road, one of two homes set to be demolished into the pit today (right in first picture). He says he's been battling his insurance company for two years to get preventative repairs to avoid a sinkhole

About two years ago, Mr Dupre started noticing cracks on the outside of his home at 1112 Robmar Road.

His insurance company, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, sent engineers to look at the cracks and they assessed that they were evidence of 'sinkhole activity'.

Their recommendation was to pump grout into the ground - a service that would cost $90,000 - $110,000.

But Mr Dupre didn't think that would be enough, so he decided to file a suit with the company to get more comprehensive repairs.

Mr Dupre continued to fight with the company up until last February, when a sinkhole opened up in nearby Seffner, Florida. The sinkhole opened up under one of the home's bedrooms, and swallowed up homeowner Jeff Bush while he was sleeping. Mr Bush's body was never recovered.

Gulp: A picture taken Thursday afternoon shows the roof of a garage being swallowed by the sinkhole

Biggest: The city engineer estimates that the hole is probably three times bigger than any other sinkhole to emerge in Dunedin

Dangerous: Yesterday, crews worked to remove a 14-foot boat trapped in the sinkhole for fear it would leak gasoline into the local water supply. Above, the bow of the boat can be seen on the edge of the hole

Fearing that a similar case could happen to his home, Mr Dupre finally caved into the insurance company's plans.

Three days ago, Champion Foundation Repair started pumping grout into the earth around Mr Dupre's home but it was too late.

Two days after they started work, a sinkhole opened up and swallowed both Mr Dupre's home and neighbor Elvira Oakes' home.

'I'm upset,' Mr Dupre told the Tampa Bay Times. This could have been taken care of a long time ago.'

'It's gone,' he added. 'This is our house. This is what we bought five years ago and hoped to grow old in.'

Mr Dupre's daughter Ivy was the first to notice the sinkhole opening Thursday morning around 5:15am.

Condemned: The view from the front of the Dupre's home at 1112 Robmar Road. It is set to be demolished into the pit today and covered with 600 dump truck loads of dirt to fill in the sinkhole

'It sounded like banging against the windows. I thought someone was trying to break-in,' Ivy told Fox 13.

After the sinkhole opened up, the Dupre's called 911. Fire and rescue officials told them to grab whatever they could and get out of the home.

'We grabbed only the important stuff. Insurance information - stuff like that,' Mr Dupre said. 'You don't really think about this kind of stuff happening.'

The Dupre's home and one neighboring home were condemned yesterday.

They will be demolished sometime today and then covered with 600 dump truck loads of dirt to stabilize the pit.

In addition to the two condemned homes, five other homes were evacuated. Two others were deemed uninhabitable but not condemned. There are no reported injuries.

Sinkhole alley: Sinkholes are common in this area of Florida, nicknamed 'sinkhole alley' for the type of porous rocks that cause the earth to shift

Into the earth: In addition to the two homes condemned by the sinkhole, five others were evacuated. Their owners will most likely be able to return to their homes today after the hole is filled in

The hole started out as 12-feet-wide when fire and rescue crews arrived on the scene around 6am Thursday morning.

The sinkhole stabilized overnight Thursday and was measured to be 90-feet-wide and 56-feet-deep this morning. That's more than three school buses deep.

The only thing salvaged from the hole was a 14-foot boat, which authorities feared would leak gasoline into the water supply if swallowed.

City Engineer Tom Burke estimates that it is the largest sinkhole that's ever opened up in Dunedin.

'It's a remarkably big sinkhole. It's the largest by probably three times,' he said.

End of the nightmare: The sinkhole was stabilized overnight Thursday

Breakfast: The sinkhole gobbled up a boat, pool and one home's master bedroom. No one was injured from the sinkhole

Residents in the surrounding homes are set to return to their homes today after the hole in filled in.

Sinkholes are common in Florida because the peninsula is made up of porous carbonate rocks such as limestone that store and help move water underground.

Over time, the rocks can dissolve from an acid created from oxygen in water, creating a void under the limestone roof. When dirt, clay or sand gets too heavy for the limestone roof, it can collapse, creating a sinkhole.

State officials say three counties in the Tampa region are known as 'sinkhole alley.'

Two-thirds of the sinkhole damage claims reported to the state Office of Insurance Regulation between 2006 and 2010 came from Hernando, Hillsborough and Pasco counties. Dunedin is in neighboring Pinellas County.
