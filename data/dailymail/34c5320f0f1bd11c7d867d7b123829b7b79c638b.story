With their metal roofs, six-foot high numbers and uncompromising industrial design, they look like shipping containers full of goods ready to be exported to China.

In fact, these awkward-looking boxes are new beach huts for the coastal town of Shoebury in Essex, where councillors hope to sell leases on them at £20,000 apiece.

Residents have branded the new huts 'monstrosities' and say they look nothing like the pretty, traditional huts just a few yards down the town's East Beach.

Waiting to be loaded onto a boat? In fact, these are beach huts for the 21st century in Shoebury, Essex

'Like shipping containers': Residents in the Essex coastal town signed a petition against the new huts

They also say the 'flimsy' design of the eight new huts will not withstand the brutal east coast winter.

Southend Council funded the £120,000 cost of building the huts - there are eight more in the pipeline - and now plans to sell seven-year leases on each one for £20,000.

The roofs are covered with small sedum plants, the walls are made of clear plastic filled with hardcore, and the fronts painted in bright colours.

But locals in the town are not impressed by the design of the huts, which are said to be made of vandal-proof materials that will not catch fire.

Anne Chalk, a councillor in Shoebury, said: 'They really do look terrible - they are monstrosities.

'I would pay £20,000 to have them pulled down - they are more like shipping containers than beach huts.'

Holiday spot: Southend Council, which approved the huts and spent £120,000 on them, hopes to let them

She added: 'They are very dark inside and I think they will be vandalised too. I don’t think they are strong enough structures to last.'

Trevor Gehlcken, who lives nearby 
said: 'What is there to stop the sea winds blowing these flimsy articles
into kingdom come? Absolutely nothing.

'They sit there with no foundations like garden sheds, just waiting to be destroyed in the first gale of the winter.

'Has anyone actually been to East 
Beach in the winter to see how rough things can get? If any of these huts are still in place this time next 
year, I will donate £50 to charity.'

And the not so traditional: The new beach huts have been criticised by locals for their design and appearance

Another eight of the huts, which were designed by a London architecture practice, are set to be built further along East Beach, despite more than 200 local residents signing a petition against them.

Andrew Moring of Southend Council defended the new addition to the Shoebury shoreline, saying they would 'blend in with our existing range'.

And the council's Alan Richards said: 'The unique and generous size of the huts has received a great deal of praise and overwhelmingly positive feedback.'
