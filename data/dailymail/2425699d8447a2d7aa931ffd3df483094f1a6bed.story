This is the heart-stopping moment a quick-thinking police officer saves a boy from choking on candy.

A body camera worn by officer Quinn Averett shows him helping little Damian Cardiel at a convenience store in Green Valley, Texas, last Monday.

'Hey buddy, you alright?' he is heard saying as he frantically taps the youngster on the back.

After officer Averett performs a Heimlich maneuver, the blockage is  dislodged from Damian's throat.

He is heard crying and calling out for his mother as he catches breath. 

It  took around a minute for the rescue to take place.

Damian had apparently swallowed a jawbreaker the size of a quarter, which he'd received in a birthday party bag.

CCTV  also filmed the chain of events unfold. 

Quick-thinking: Officer Quinn Averett saved Damian Cardiel from choking on candy at a convenience store in Green Valley, Texas, last Monday. The pair have since been reunited

Damian's parents can be seen running into the store with him. His father, Trino Valencia, tries tipping him upside-down to remove the candy, with no joy.

The cashier then calls the emergency services to report the choking incident before officer Averett, steps in to save the day.

He was on his way home from work when the 911 call came in.

Paramedics were later called to the scene but deemed Damian well enough to go home. 

Days later he and his family paid officer Averett a visit at work to thank him for his heroic actions.
