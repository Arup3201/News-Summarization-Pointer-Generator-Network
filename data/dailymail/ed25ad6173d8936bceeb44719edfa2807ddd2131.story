Under fire: Cllr Paul Whittle is facing calls to step down after missing almost half the meetings at Fareham Borough Council working Saudi Arabia

A leading Liberal Democrat councillor is facing calls to step down after taking a £180,000-a-year job in Saudi Arabia - 4,000 miles from his ward in Hampshire. 

Cllr Paul Whittle has kept his £13,000 allowance from Fareham Borough Council, Hampshire, despite working full-time as director of contracts for the Colleges of Excellence in the city of Riyadh.

He has missed six of his 14 committee meetings since assuming the role in February.

Now, voters and colleagues are further enraged after he failed to show at the Local Government Association conference - which costs the council £500 per person.

The council's Tory leader Sean Woodward said he should step down, adding: 'Perhaps he should spend more time in his ward Fareham East, than in the Middle East.' 

The TaxPayers' Alliance also has concerns that taxpayers' money was wasted on the conference - describing it as a 'costly no-show'.

Andy Silvester, of The TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'This costly no-show will only add to suspicions that Cllr Whittle can't balance the responsibilities of a local representative with a job on the other side of the world.

'He should pay back the ticket out of his own pocket - paying it out of his allowances is just shuffling taxpayers' money around, rather than refunding them.'

Cllr Whittle, who has also failed to attend any meetings of the smaller committees he sits on since he began juggling both roles, has taken to sending representatives to his engagements in Hampshire.

The business expert, who also works part-time as a magistrate in Britain, claims his full-time job in Saudi Arabia is flexible and that he could be contacted via email and phone.

The company he now works for, a collection of 37 colleges across Saudi Arabia, bills itself as a leading trainer in technical and vocational business skills.

It holds courses in leadership, how to trade internationally, and how to make it in business across the world - from Germany to Japan.

Brokering deals for the leading training school 4,000 miles from home, Cllr Whittle's colleagues complain that he is in no position to hold the opposition to account.

The council's deputy Tory leader Trevor Cartwright said there was a difference between working full-time locally and commuting to Saudi Arabia.

Cllr Cartwright said he worked for ten years in Portsmouth while a councillor, so he appreciates the difficulties of juggling responsibilities.

He said: 'You can either be in your ward or working abroad, you cannot do both.'

Ukip's Chris Wood added: 'Someone working in Saudi Arabia will find it difficult to hold the Conservative administration to account.'

Riyadh is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia.

It is home to 5,254,560 people.

The city is divided into 15 municipal districts headed up by the mayor and the governor.

It has the largest all-female university in the world.

In 1950, King Saud ordered for Riyadh to be remodelled in the style of American cities, with grid-like layouts.

It is a cultural and shopping metropolis, with a 'Kingdom Center' to shop in.

It is host to four major football clubs and often hosts major FIFA tournaments.

With a number of highways, people travel by chauffeur-driven car or taxi.

Fareham is a market town at the north-west tip of Portsmouth harbour.

It is home to 97,504 people.

The city is known for manufacturing bricks and growing strawberries.

Current employment includes retail, which a few dozen shops, and small-scale manufacturing.

It has a non-league football club, Fareham Town FC.

It is served by road and rail networks, with the M27 nearby.

Places of interest include Portchester Castle, Britain's second-oldest man-made waterway, and the last-surviving VIctorian steam-powered brickworks.

Cllr Whittle is offering to pay back the ticket cost from his  councillor allowances and denies he should step down.

He said: 'I always attend council meetings to fulfil my duties to my residents and the council.

'I am one of the few who work, I get a little bit irritated when you say 'how can you be a councillor and work?'

'If somebody can prove that I would not be able to represent residents then they would have a point.

'Nobody could suggest that I do not work hard and do my job.

'I like to deal with people face-to-face and I will be at as many meetings as I can manage.'

Ward colleague and fellow Liberal Democrat Katrina Trott was quick to defend him.

She said: 'He's standing up for his residents.

'The Tories are stirring up trouble and would like to have him gone and he is an effective opposition leader.

Outrage: Fareham Borough councillors claim he cannot hold the opposition to account from Saudi Arabia

'We have every confidence in him as leader.'

The Local Government Association's annual conference is the biggest event in the local government calendar.

Cllr Whittle missed the event, held in Bournemouth, Dorset, on July 7 and 8, at a cost of more than 500 pounds a ticket.

Traditionally, Fareham's council leader, opposition leader and chief executive attend the event every year.

Cllr Whittle claims he told officers a week before that he could not attend, something the council denies.

A council spokesman said: 'At no point were we informed that Cllr Whittle would not be attending the event.'

Constituents in Fareham East have expressed their views on their globe-trotting representative, doubting his capabilities to juggle both roles.

Neil Slatcher, 35, said: 'I don't think he will commute, I think he will be over there more than he will be over here.'

Vernon Ross, 86, added: 'I don't think he can do his job properly, how can he?

'I don't think you should be the leader of the Lib Dems and be out in Saudi Arabia.'
