Chinese police destroyed £21 million of counterfeit designer goods today in a lavish publicity stunt aimed at showing the world they are cracking down on the illegal trade.

Fake wine, cigarettes, handbags and cosmetics were all thrown on a fire in Guiyang, southwest China's Guizhou Province.

But authorities have a long way to go - a recent UN report revealed a staggering 75 per cent of all fake goods seized worldwide from 2008 to 2010 were primarily from China.

Most of the counterfeit trade sourced from East Asia ends up in the United States and Europe.

A high percentage of items are purchased on the internet.

Shippers sometimes route deliveries through 
ports in the Middle East or Africa to avoid detection by customs.

Most counterfeits fall into four categories: CDs and DVDs; accessories, watches and footwear; tobacco products; and textiles.

Gucci handbags retail between £500 -£3,390 in stores. But fake versions can be picked up for around £15-£30.

Rayban sunglasses usually sell for £100, but they fake reproductions can be bought for as little as £4.

London boroughs and county councils prosecuted 372 people for the sale of counterfeit electrical goods in 2009.

That figure dropped to 245 last year.

In the past four years there has been a
 six-fold increase in the number of counterfeit electrical goods seized 
in the UK in the last four years, according to a report.

The value of seized counterfeit 
electrical items has risen from £2,614,783 in 2009 to £15,725,462 in 
2012, according to figures obtained by The Co-operative Electrical from 
local councils and Border Force, the arm of the Home Office responsible 
for border control operations.

The World Customs Organisation also said
 the booming industry accounts for some two per cent of world trade 
despite it being considered a 'soft' form of crime.

The UN report stated that counterfeit goods accounted for one third of the organised crime in East Asia and the 
Pacific is worth approximately $90bn (£58bn).

Most counterfeits fall into four categories: CDs and DVDs; accessories, watches and footwear; tobacco products; and textiles.

Counterfeit commerce over the Internet 
has soared in the past couple of years, turning what had been an 
irritant to businesses into a serious competitive threat.

Last year an entire city in China literally shut up shop when nearly all
 of its stores closed after it was falsely reported that officials were 
planning a clampdown on the sale of counterfeit products.

Officials in Shenyang city were forced to beg store owners to reopen after 95 per cent of shops remain closed.

The online rumour sparked fears that 
the local council needed to get more revenue and had ordered taxmen to 
come down hard on shop owners.

Western countries have often complained China is woefully behind in its effort to stamp out the trade, although it has started to crack down.

Domination: Nearly 75 percent of counterfeit products seized worldwide from 2008 to 2010 were made in east Asia, and China was the primary producer

In July 2011, the Chinese government concluded a nine-month enforcement drive, leading to the arrests of more than 9,000 suspects in connection with the seizure of £34 million worth of counterfeit products

In November police arrested 73 people suspected of manufacturing and selling almost 1 million fake luxury bags in China.

The Ministry of Public Security said 
police seized more than 20,000 fake Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Coach bags
 and closed 37 sites where the forgery ring made or sold the bags.

Police said the ring sold more than 960,000 bags and exported many to the United States and Middle East.

The ministry said that police in 
southern Guangdong province uncovered the forgery ring in January 2012 
and that Chinese agents worked with U.S. customs and immigration 
officials in the case.

It said authorities seized assets 
worth 5 billion yuan (£52million), including unsold counterfeit goods, 
production equipment and bank accounts.

Another series of raids took place in July 2012 across 190 cities - the products seized were valued at £117 million.

More than 2,000 people were arrested and 1,100 facilities were destroyed.
