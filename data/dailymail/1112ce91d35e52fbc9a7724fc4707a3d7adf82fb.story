A video has surfaced of the Muslim activist who described ISIS executioner Jihaji John as 'a beautiful man' calling for Jihad at an anti-US rally in London.

Asim Qureshi urged protestors to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya.

Speaking through a microphone at the the pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir movement rally, human rights group CAGE's research director preached: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies.

Asim Qureshi urged protestors to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya in a speech made outside the US Embassy in London

He urged supporters to help 'Jihad brothers and sisters'

'When we see Hezbollah defeating the armies of Israel, we know where the solution is and where the victory lies.

'We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the Jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West.

'Allahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar!'

Qureshi - who in an outrageous 58 minute interview broadcast live on Thursday afternoon also described Mohammed Emwazi, the man revealed as the black robed ISIS executioner, as 'the most humble young person that I ever knew' - stands alone on a stage in the 54 second clip, shot at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in 2006.Qureshi  worked for CAGE at the time of his passionate speech, then known as CAGE Prisoners.

The organisation claim to 'strive for a world free from oppression and injustice', 'working to empower communities impacted by the War on Terror.'

Qureshi told Juliane Assange that he is in favour of both stoning and the death penalty

However, the video footage, posted on YouTube, now raises questions  about Qureshi, who alongside former control order detainee Cerie Bullivant tried to pin the blame for Mohammed Emwazi's radicalisation on the British Government.

He also revealed that he'd been in regular contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria.

And in a second video, in which Qureshi is quizzed by Juliane Assange on his view of Sharia law, in particularly stoning, he responded saying: 'I agree with Islamic concepts of how we practice our punishments.'

Asked if he believes in the use of the death penalty, he added: 'From an Islamic perspective, yes. As long as all the due process elements are met.' 

In the wake of Emwazi's unmasking as the world's most wanted man, CAGE yesterday released a statement entitled 'Jihadi John: 'Radicalised' By Britain'.

The release stated that Emwazi 'desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him,' a view later echoed on CAGE's press conference, which was broadcast live on both BBC and Sky News.

Qureshi then used the statement to criticise the British security services, arguing that counter-terror measures turned young Muslims into extremists. 

Haras Rafiq, managing director of the anti-radicalisation think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, told Newsweek that CAGE's accusation that Britain was to blame for Emwazi's radicalisation was 'rubbish'.

He said: 'It is not anybody else's fault. It's not the British or Kuwaitis fault.

'It is his fault and the people who radicalised him. He is a cold-hearted killer.'

'If you look at [CAGE's] raison d'être, they are there to defend these kind of people. There has been evidence that these guys are sympathetic to this type of ideology.'

In posts made on Twitter, Quilliam co-founder and chairman Maajid Nawaz, also blasted CAGE, hinting that Qureshi was a supporter of controversial speaker, Haitham Haddad.

A representative from CAGE was not immediately available for comment when requested.
