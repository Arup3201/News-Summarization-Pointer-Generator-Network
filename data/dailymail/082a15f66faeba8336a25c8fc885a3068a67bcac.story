The Gowanus Canal, long recognized for its extensive pollution, has been captured in a series of abstract photographs, offering a new perspective.

Though photographer Steven Hirsch was raised in Brooklyn, it wasn't until 2010 he saw the canal with his own eyes, he told ABC in 2011.

'It was shocking and sad to see a waterway that should be teeming with life has become so polluted and such a blight to the community,' Hirsch told the channel. 'I can only imagine its horrendous condition in its heyday as an industrial center. I sat by the edge of the canal and made these photographs of the waterâ€™s surface on a bright spring day. The smell was so noxious I could only stay 20 minutes.'

The photographs were taken off of the water's surface, Hirsch writes on his website. They show fragmented, colored swirls in the canal, making mesmerizing abstract shapes and figures.

The Gowanus Canal was completed in the 1800s and used as a major waterway. Over time, the canal suffered from 'years of discharges, storm water runoff, sewer outflows and industrial pollutants,' the EPA says, and known pollutants include PCBs and coal tar wastes. In 2010 the agency added the canal to its list of Superfund sites.

The canal was also long-rumored to be a dumping ground for the mafia, the Village Voice notes, and was even nicknamed 'Perfume Creek' and 'Lavender Lake' for its strong odor.

Hirsch, who teaches at Pratt Institute, has a number of other art projects available for viewing on his website, including a photo series on Cherry Patch Ranch, an 'abandoned and haunted' Nevada brothel, as well as a portrait series with people who claim to have been abducted by aliens.
