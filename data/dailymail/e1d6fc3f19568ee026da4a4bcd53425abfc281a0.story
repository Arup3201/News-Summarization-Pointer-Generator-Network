The thought of flying a high-speed plane in close formation 500ft above the sea would fill most people with dread.

But it wasn't enough for a trio of British pilots - who've thrown wing-mounted explosives into the bargain.

Dubbed the Flying Comets, Oxfordshire trio Twister Aerobatics are believed to be Europe's first 'pyrotechnic air display team', dazzling crowds all over the world with the stream of sparks which burst out of their wings.

Sparks will fly! The thought of flying a high-speed plane in close formation 500ft above the sea would fill most people with dread, but it wasn't enough for a trio of British pilots - who've thrown wing-mounted explosives into the bargain. Oxfordshire trio Twister Aerobatics have dazzled crowds across the world, with strict safety rules

Adrenalin: The team perform their routines of loop-the-loops and nose-dives at the Barcelona Air Festival. In built up areas they fly at 1,000ft for safety reasons

Breathtaking: The trio of British pilots who make up the Twister aerobatics team perform their pyrotechnic aerial display over Sanicol, Belgium, last year

Flashes of light: Team leader Peter Wells said it can take some time for a pilot's eyes to adjust when flying in close formation, rotating as they go to the awe of the crowd

Skilled: The Twister aerobatics team perform at the Royal Bahrain International Air Show - and this picture shows just how close the planes fly to each other

Awe: A display by the team last year over Salagalia, Italy. The team has performed in Dubai, Bahrain, Poland and Italy among other foreign countries

Pilots Peter Wells, Jon Gowdy and Guy Westgate came together after searching for 'something new' having flown for years in other teams or individually.

After obtaining a display rating Mr Wells flew as a solo glider before meeting Guy Westgate at an air show.

Years
 later they were joined by Jon Gowdy, a British Airways pilot, and began
 putting together their jaw-dropping routines of loop-the-loops and 
nose-dives while sparks pour from their aircraft’s wing tips.

Team leader Mr Wells, 48, said: 'It’s just so different and it is amazing to watch - when I first saw it I was stunned. I suppose we look a bit like flying comets.'

Back on the ground: The planes pictured at their Oxfordshire base. The men fly in Silent Twisters developed and built by Mr Wells after he spotted a prototype in Germany

Experienced: Lead pilot Peter Wells has flown all over the desert in
 the Middle East and over Mont Blanc in the Alps in his tiny plane. Inside the cockpit, right, is pictured

The team has performed in Dubai, 
Bahrain, Poland and Italy among other foreign countries, at corporate 
functions and even weddings.

'One
 bride once phoned us after the show in tears saying it was the most 
incredible thing,' said Mr Wells. 'She was so grateful she invited us to
 her reception.'

Sometimes they rotate in formation, which requires extra practice.

Upside down: The ride would be enough to make anyone feel queasy, but luckily the pilots have years of experience. They say they look like flying comets

Say cheese! One of the trio pulls a face over Andorra, Italy - though whether it's due to G-forces for for his own amusement will be known only to him

At its lowest, the team can fly 500ft above the sea to be in accordance with licensing laws - but crowds will be thankful to know that figure is usually much higher

'It takes an awful lot of work,' he said. 'Even though we’ll all know one display, each pilot might do something slightly differently so it takes a lot of effort because we need to know exactly what we’re doing when we’re up there.

'Though it’s heavily regulated, there isn’t really much room for error. Once those pyros are on, they’re on.'

In accordance with licensing laws the aircraft have to be at least 500ft above ground to perform with the wing-tip pyrotechnics.

However, the team doubles this figure when flying above land to be extra-cautious, and they don't fly above crowds due to safety regulations.

During a display, the second pilot must rely almost entirely on the leader to know where he is going, said Mr Wells, who keeps the planes on his farm near Thame, Oxfordshire.

'I’m always the leader when I fly so when Guy or Jon is flying behind me they’ve got to follow exactly what I’m doing,' he said. 'If their engine broke or for whatever reason they have to break from the routine it would take their eyes a good 10 seconds to adjust and regain full function.

'Though it’s heavily regulated, there isn’t really much room for error,' said Mr Wells, who has flown stunts for several years. 'Once those pyros are on, they’re on'

Dizzy heights: The Twister aerobatics team perform a loop-the-loop during their unique pyrotechnic aerial display over London

Home safe and sound: Mr Wells admits there's no room for error once the pilots are in the sky and the pyros are on - but the display is heavily regulated

'They’re in the wake of the brightest lights you can imagine.'

Pyrotechnic air displays are certainly not unheard of - they were being done in the U.S. in the 1940s - but they're certainly a special sight for the thousands of people entertained by them.

Mr Wells added: 'We are lucky, we’ve been able to see some absolutely incredible things because of the team.

'We’ve flown ourselves over the desert in the Middle East and over Mont Blanc in the Alps, it’s an amazing way to see the world.'
