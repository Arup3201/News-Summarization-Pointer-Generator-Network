The Queen, Margaret Thatcher and J.K. Rowling have been celebrated in a list of the top 40 women who changed the world.

The list, which also includes Marilyn Monroe and 17-year-old girls' education activist Malala Yousafzai, was topped by pioneering Polish chemist Marie Curie, who was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize – and won it twice. 

British nurse Florence Nightingale came second and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was third. 

Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and Mother Teresa completed the top five.

Royals fared well, with the Queen, Princess Diana, Queen Victoria, the Queen Mother and Elizabeth I all in the top 20.

The most admired quality of women in the list, which was compiled after a poll of 2,000 British adults by Sky Arts, was that they were not afraid to challenge the beliefs of their time. 

But two thirds of those polled said young women today lack inspirational figures and eight in ten felt youngsters idolise modern celebrities too much.

The poll was conducted to coincide with the launch of the second series of Sky Arts' Psychobitches, a sketch show with an all-star cast which will see women including The Mitford sisters and Florence Nightingale examined on the psychologist's couch.

Margaret Thatcher came in third in the list, which was compiled after 2,000 adults were polled

The series will again see a number of iconic women from history played by a core cast, as well as guest stars including Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Meera Syal and Jack Whitehall.   

A spokeswoman for Sky Arts said, 'There's no doubt that the women on this list changed the world and continue to inspire people today.

'These characters - and all the women in the series - offer us a light-hearted look at what these incredible women might have confessed on the psychiatrist's couch, given the chance.

'In Psychobitches we get to see another side of some of them the Margaret Thatcher, Joan of Arc and Queen Elizabeth I you see on the show present themselves very differently to how they are depicted in history books.'
