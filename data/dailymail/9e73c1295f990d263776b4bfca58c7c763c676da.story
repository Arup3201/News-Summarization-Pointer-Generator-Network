Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said the mix of resource, population and Government policy pressures was a significant factor in the 'rapid deterioration' in safety

Fights and assaults are a daily occurrence in the nation's prisons with unprecedented levels of violence, a damning report has warned.

The chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick also found suicides behind bars are at a 10-year high.

And he suggested that the rise in problems in jails could be linked to government reforms and spending cuts, a claim disputed by the government.

In his annual report, Mr Hardwick said prisoners are increasingly clambering on to the netting between wing landings in an attempt to be moved to a safer prison.

So-called incidents of height - described as 'a one person riot' - nearly doubled in 2013-14 to 1,007 from 591 in the previous year.

Inmates climb on to the netting or railings in the hope they will be taken to segregation units and then 'shipped out' of the prison to a safer jail, where conditions appear better or where they will be closer to home, the report added.

Mr Hardwick said the mix of resource, population and Government policy pressures was a significant factor in the 'rapid deterioration' in safety and increase in violence at prisons in the period.

Elsewhere, the report said the number of assaults involving adult male prisoners increased by 14 per cent on the year before and was the highest for any year for which there is data. There was also a 38 per cent rise in the number of serious assaults.

Mr Hardwick said: 'In all establishments there were fights and assaults almost every day.'

But the inspector said 'of most concern' was the 69 per cent increase in the number of self-inflicted deaths from 52 in 2012013 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years.

Mr Hardwick said the deterioration in safety and rise in violence was set against a backdrop of £84 million cuts to public sector prison running costs and £88 million saved as a result of the closure of older prisons.

In addition, planned staffing reductions involved in these changes resulted in a significant loss of more experienced staff as old jails closed.

Meanwhile, the total prison population rose from 84,083 at the end of April 2013, which was 96 per cent of the usable operational capacity, to 85,252 at the end of March 2014, 99 per cent of the usable operational capacity.

And ministers are pushing through a significant policy agenda, the inspector said, including Government plans to transform rehabilitation.

Prisons Minister Andrew Selous said: 'The last year has seen the Prison Service manage major organisational change to create significant savings for the taxpayer - it has been challenging for staff and I thank them for their hard work and dedication.

'During this time we have always had enough staff to deliver decent and safe prison regimes, and this will continue to be our top priority.

'We remain committed to reducing violence and understanding the reasons for the recent rise in self-inflicted deaths.

'But this is a complex issue and the Chief Inspector has failed to provide any evidence to support his assertion that this is linked to the reforms made under this Government.'

There was a 69 per cent increase in the number of suicides in prisons from 52 in 2012-13 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'There is no evidence to link staffing levels, or crowding levels, to the number of self-inflicted deaths across the estate. We always closely monitor any possible trends.'

Responding to the Chief Inspector's report, a Downing Street spokeswoman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'Our priority is keeping the British public safe and making sure our prisons are run in a safe and decent way.

'We will always ensure there are enough staff to deliver safe and effective prison regimes, and we will always keep looking at what more we could be doing.

'If you look at the facts and what prison staff have done in recent years, assaults are lower, numbers of positive drugs tests are lower, numbers of escapes from custody are lower, so we are making progress.' 

Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'Safe and decent prisons are a mark of a civilised society.

'From the Chief Inspector's shattering, incisive overview it's clear that our deteriorating prisons are less safe and less decent than even a year ago.'
