Paul Daniels has admitted he is unable to remember all his past lovers  – and said he hoped they were all over the age of consent.

The veteran entertainer and magician said he once kissed a ‘slightly tiddly’ schoolgirl before realising she was underage.

And he said it was impossible to tell the age of his ‘groupies’ in the 1970s because they wore ‘super-short mini skirts’ and ‘teetering high heels’.

Paul Daniels: 'Life in the 1070s was a blur and therein lies a major problem with what is going on now'

Daniels, 74, was responding to the Jimmy Savile sex abuse claims on his online blog when he made the admissions.

Writing about ‘what it was like back then’, he said comedians, impressionists and magicians were all routinely offered sex by girls, adding: ‘I have been wondering if all of [Savile’s] accusers are for real.’

He said: ‘Did I have such a life? Yes. I would be lying if I said I didn’t. Were they all over 16? OMG, I hope so. Can I remember them? No.

‘Life back then was a blur, and therein lies a major problem with what is going on now. It was 35-40 years ago. How the hell can you say you did or you didn’t? Anyone can come along and claim to have been “abused” by anyone they care to name.’

Daniels is married to his former 
stage assistant Debbie McGee, 54. They met at rehearsals for his magic 
stage show in 1979, and married nine years later. He has three grown-up 
sons from his first marriage.

In
one passage, he confessed he had a ‘passionate’ encounter with a 
schoolgirl hitch-hiker after his first season as a professional magician
in 1969.

He said: ‘My confession? I turned pro when I was 30 and my first summer season was in Newquay.

‘I had a great time and when the season was over headed north after the last show. A long long drive and in the middle of the night and in the middle of the country a mini-skirted girl was thumbing a lift.

‘I gave her a lift and drove on into the night a few miles whilst the more than slightly tiddly girl moaned on about her boyfriend ignoring her in the pub that night and that she would get own back on him.

‘Oh goodie for me I thought and when we got to her town I kissed her goodnight and it got a bit more passionate.’

Daniels
said when he realised how young the girl was after they had kissed, he 
immediately threw her out of the car and drove away. He said: ‘Thank God
it didn’t get TOO passionate because something she said sent a shiver 
down my spine... Another question and she said she was still at school.

‘I
had her out of the car as fast as I could and I drove off with the 
lights off so she couldn’t see my number plate.’ He added: ‘I felt sick.
I was terrified but maybe that scare was a good thing ’cos from then on
I would always talk about their jobs or whatever before anything went 
too far. So there I am.’

Discussing
the sex abuse revelations against Savile, Daniels stressed the late DJ 
and BBC TV presenter was a ‘bad guy’, adding: ‘There were always 
rumours, even rumours of far worse things than I have seen reported.’

Paul Daniels, pictured with his wife Debbie McGee in Peter Pan at Aylesbury Civic Centre, said he always made sure how old people were after his encounter with the schoolgirl

Police are currently investigating 450 abuse allegations against Savile, who died last year aged 84.

But
Daniels said he doubted whether all of his accusers were telling the 
truth. He said: ‘What I do find odd about the stories that are now 
emerging however, is when a “victim” went on TV and stated that she had 
gone back to his dressing room quite a few times.

'Nobody seemed to take much notice of the headmistress of the girls’ school who said that what people were not taking into account was the fact, her words, that these were “bad girls, who would do anything for a fag”.

‘A bad guy? Undoubtedly, but I have been wondering if all of the accusers are for real. For over 400 of them to keep quiet for 40 years seems strange.’

An NSPCC spokesman said: ‘Accusations of sexual offences must always be taken seriously no matter how long ago they were.

‘Victims often find it very difficult to speak out and may therefore  not report offences for years or even decades.
