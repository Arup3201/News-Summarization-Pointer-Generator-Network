A leading consultant is to appear in court accused of using hidden equipment to spy on patients at a private hospital.

Hearing specialist Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh is alleged to have secretly recorded intimate images of female patients, colleagues and visitors.

The 61-year-old world-renowned expert was arrested at St Anthony’s Hospital in North Cheam, Surrey, after one potential victim raised the alarm.

Potential victim raised alarm: Dr Lam Hoe Yeoh was arrested at St Anthony's Hospital in North Cheam, Surrey

Detectives were shocked to discover evidence that Yeoh may have used sophisticated equipment to amass a potentially huge collection of material.

They are now trying to identify more than 70 women and have appealed for anyone who suspects they may have been covertly filmed to come forward.

Yeoh, a father of three, is also accused of making indecent images of children and possessing extreme pornography.

Last night the hospital said the doctor has been suspended from his duties as the Scotland Yard investigation continued.

The arrest has shocked staff and patients at the historic hospital, which was recently bought by a private healthcare group.

It was previously owned by Roman Catholic nuns, the Daughters of the Cross of Liege, who founded it in 1904.

The investigation into Yeoh began in 
April. Police were so concerned they arrested him at his workplace and 
seized computer equipment.

Yeoh was originally charged with one count of voyeurism but 29 further counts were brought against him as the inquiry widened.

It is understood that some images are alleged to have been recorded in a toilet at the hospital, with others taken at unidentified locations.

Yeoh, who is also known by the first name Robin, lives with his wife Ivy, 57, at a £750,000 home in Banstead, Surrey.

His two daughters attended Cambridge University. He is a renowned expert in tinnitus, vertigo and dizziness, and has spent more than 20 years treating both children and adults.

Yeoh has been an outspoken critic of earphones and MP3 players, claiming they are damaging the hearing of an entire generation of young people.

Regular clinic: The consultant surgeon has been based at the NHS St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey

The consultant surgeon has been based at the NHS St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, where he ran a regular clinic.

In addition to St Anthony’s, he has worked at two other private hospitals, the Cromwell in Chelsea and the Portland in Central London.

He is an honorary senior lecturer at St George’s medical school in Tooting, South London, has given expert evidence in cases at the High Court and is  director of two companies.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that Yeoh was arrested in April and that since then a number of further alleged victims had been identified.

He said the doctor has been charged with 30 counts of voyeurism, which cover at least 70 unknown victims.

Yeoh has further been charged with two counts of making indecent images of a child as well as two counts of possession of extreme pornography.

Yeoh will appear at Croydon Crown Court on August 19.
