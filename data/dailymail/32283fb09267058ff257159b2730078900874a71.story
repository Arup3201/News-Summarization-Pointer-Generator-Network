A super-mall and tourism complex proposed for the Grand Canyon would include fast food chains, hotels, gift shops and a gondola to take those who don’t want to hike or ride a mule to its bottom.

One of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, the Grand Canyon has a problem with bringing in cash from the millions of tourist who visit it every year.

But the entrepreneurs behind the proposed Grand Canyon Escalade will give visitors greater access and ability to marvel at nature's handiwork over the past two billion or so years. 

Unspoiled: The Grand Canyon could soon have a mega-mall with fast food chains and hotels

Easy-access: A 1.4-mile gondola could transport 4,000 tourists to the bottom of the canyon each day

What where: Elements of the designs currently up for approval by the Navajo nation

Plans: Hotels, restaurants, retail outlets and a cultural visitor centre are among elements of the proposal

The project, currently being reviewed by Navajo tribal government, would be built on 420 acres next to what is known as the Confluence, where the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers meet.

Developer R. Lamar Whitmer also plans a cultural centre, amphitheatre and an elevated 1,900ft-long walkway along the river's edge.

At present the routes down to the bottom include mule rides, hiking, rafts from other areas or helicopters for the well-heeled, but investors argue the development would bring a greater appreciation and access to the majesty of the place.

Their figures claim the majority of the canyon’s five million tourists each year spending less than an hour admiring its edge before moving on – they say a 1.4-mile tramway could transport about 4,000 visitors to the bottom every day where the layer of Vishnu Schist is among the most ancient exposed rock on earth.  

Cultural: The developers explain the virtues of the deluxe restaurant, cultural centre and art studios

The proposal also says the project would bring 3,200 jobs in for the Navajo, whose greatest cultural issue is unemployment.

Not surprisingly, there is fierce opposition to the plans with some opposed to any building on sacred land, the commercialising one of the world’s most iconic natural landmarks and the potential damage additional tourism could do to the park’s ecosystem. 

In 2007, the less ambitious Skywalk at Grand Canyon West, run by the Hualapai nation, faced a battle before they opened a controversial glass bridge that jutted out over the rim but it largely been viewed as a success and provided a financial shot in the arm for the area's caretakers.

Overlooking: The Skywalk on the West Rim of the Grand Canyon was a controversial addition to the canyon

Do look down: The glass-bottomed ledge offers a unique attraction to visitors
