With Lent just a few weeks away, chocolate may be among the treats Pope Francis plans to give up for the religious fasting.

So he may want to start tucking into this chocolate gift now - a life-sized version of himself moulded out of 1.5tons of Cocoa from Atitlan, in Guatemala, central America.

The Pope was presented with the unique chocolate statue of himself in the Vatican by a group of 20 amateurs chocolatiers yesterday.

Just in time for Lent: Pope Francis is presented with a life-sized chocolate statue of himself at the Vatican

Students on a course at the Accademia of Maestri Cioccolatieri, near Venice, Italy, spent four weeks creating the chocolate statue in the Pope's image.

The students picked the Pope as the person they wanted to make out of chocolate because of his popularity since he was elected the Bishop of Rome in March last year.

But the Pope's simple tastes in food is well documented, so it is unlikely he will try a piece of his chocolate statue.

Hailing from Flores, a middle-class neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Pope Francis grew up in a city famous for its meaty cuisine.

But he is said to favour frugal, healthy meals made up up fruit, salads and skinless chicken.

While he admits to occasionally indulging in an espresso or a glass of wine, but he rarely eats any rich foods.

So perhaps the statue will end up raising money for charity - much like the Pope's former Harley Davidson which sold for £200,000 at auction yesterday.

The head of the Catholic Church decided to auction off the Dyna Super Glide bike and donate the funds to Caritas Roma, a charity which supports those in need around the world.

The 1,585cc Harley Davidson went under the hammer yesterday at Bonhams' Grand Palais auction with an estimate of just £10,000.

But the prospect of owning a bike belonging to the Pope became too much for many, sending bidding through the roof.

Potential buyers in the room, on the phone and online battled it out for the bike, with offers soon crossing the 100,000 euro (£83,000) mark.

Bids continued to come with an online customer winning the auction, paying a staggering 210,000 euros (£175,000). Premiums took the final price to £200,976.

Pope Francis helped raised more than £200,000 for charity yesterday by selling his signed Harley Davidson. 

The head of the Catholic Church doesn't get much time to cruise around the streets of Rome on the Dyna Super Glide bike. 

So he decided to auction it off and donate the funds to Caritas Roma, a charity which supports those in need around the world.

Next up came the Pope's biker jacket, which sold for a staggering £47,851 - bringing his charity sales to almost £250,000.

The staggering sale had similarities to when a US casino owner paid £127,000 for Pope Benedict XVI's Volkswagen Golf in 2005.

All for a good cause: A Harley Davidson Super Glide Custom 1,585cc donated to Pope Francis last year has sold for a staggering £200,000 at auction
