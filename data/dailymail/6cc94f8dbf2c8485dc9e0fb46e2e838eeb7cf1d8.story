Taser shootings will soon be captured on camera in a bid to quell growing concern about the potentially deadly weapons.

Police chiefs believe the footage will provide vital evidence after controversial incidents such as the death of ‘human fireball’ Andrew Pimlott in Plymouth.

They are preparing to trial the high-tech digital cameras which can be worn on glasses, body armour or the Taser itself.

But In Australia, an independent 
watchdog discovered police simply ignored damning material captured 
during a string of shootings.

Government scientists have already visited several overseas forces where they found they provide compelling footage.

But critics questioned whether police 
will try and cover-up video evidence that illustrates abuse of the 
50,000-volt weapons.

In
Australia, the cameras caught officers as they repeatedly Tasered a 
disabled man who refused to get out of bed and a suicidal man in a 
police cell who fell heavily on to concrete.

After apparently being Tasered the topless man collapses on the floor. Simon Chesterman, the most senior officer responsible for Tasers and firearms in the UK, said he is 'keen' to investigate the use of cameras

Simon Chesterman, the most senior officer responsible for Tasers and firearms nationwide, said he is ‘keen’ to investigate the use of cameras.

The West Mercia deputy chief constable said advances in technology could make them a useful tool to protect officers and the public.

He said: ‘The technology has moved on and there are now products that officers can wear that appear to work much better.

‘It is as much about public accountability as protecting the officers themselves and supporting them.

‘I am interested in offering frontline officers better protection. By that I do not just mean physically but in terms of the law as well.

‘We have a duty to explore this. We did it before and it came to nothing because of the poor quality.

‘But we have moved on as far as technology is concerned and it is certainly worth exploring again.’

Andrew Pimlott burned to death outside his home in Plymouth when officers used a Taser on him after he doused himself in petrol

The death of Andrew Pimlott, 32, has thrown the use of Tasers, by police officers with just three days of training, back to the top of the agenda.

He died from horrific burns last week, several days after one was fired at him after he doused himself in fuel in his back garden.

The Met is one of the first forces likely to trial the cameras as 1,200 extra officers are being trained to wield stun guns.

The move reflects a national trend in which many forces are increasing the number of Taser officers amid fears for their safety.

The Police Federation wants every officer to be armed with a Taser by increasing the number to around 32,000 - enough for every officer on duty.

Police prefer body-worn cameras because gun-mounted versions would mean the weapon is pointed constantly at the subject.

But some frontline representatives are worried the cameras will present a ‘one sided’ version of events that does not catch the build-up to any violent encounters.

The Australian Taser footage, filmed in New South Wales, provides disturbing evidence of how the weapons can be misused.

The police ombudsman found that Tasers were not used appropriately during one in seven confrontations, including when suspects were already handcuffed.

In one, a disabled man is Tasered three times after he refused to get out of bed to be arrested and cowers behind a pillow crying: ‘Stop it please.’

In another, a suspected thief is zapped as he knelt on the floor with his hands behind his head as he calmly told police: ‘I’ve done nothing wrong.’

And dramatic footage shows a drink driving suspect being brought down and then shocked repeatedly as he attempted to run up a flight of stairs.

London politician Caroline Pidgeon, who oversees the work of the Met, welcomed the forthcoming camera trials.

She said: ‘As Tasers can be used inappropriately with horrifying consequences it is vital that basic checks are in place to ensure their use is constantly monitored.

‘A good start would be the routine provision of cameras connected to every Taser so ensuring that recorded video footage is always available for every incident when they are used.’

Nick Pickles, director of the Big Brother
Watch campaign group, said he would be concerned about the release of 
more cameras on the streets.

He said: ‘This is a one-sided tool. How would police officers react if members of the public routinely filmed them?’

One of the most popular cameras, which clips on to glasses, helmets or hats, is already used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies across the US.

The device, which is made by the same company as the Taser, constantly captures the last 30 seconds which can be saved by pressing a button.

An overdue report on Taser use to be published within weeks is expected to reveal a huge rise in their use.

According to research by the Daily Mail, Tasers were fired at suspects at least 1,081 times in 2011, compared with just 744 in 2010.
