Cyprus has agreed a one-off levy on deposits over 100,000 euros in a dramatic U-turn today as it raced to satisfy lenders and seal an 11th-hour bailout deal to avert financial collapse.

According to reports, Cyprus has agreed with EU/IMF lenders a 20 per cent levy on deposits over 100,000 euros (Â£85,335) at leading lender Bank of Cyprus.

A four per cent levy on deposits of the same amount will be made at other lenders, a senior Cypriot official said.

The official, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity, said a Cypriot plan to tap nationalised pension funds, 
opposed by Germany, would not be part of a plan to raise billions of 
euros in return for a bailout from the European Union.

Eurozone finance ministers will meet on Sunday evening for crucial talks to discuss the bailout for Cyprus.

Finance Minister Michalis Sarris said
'significant progress' had been made as Cypriot politicians desperately race to agree on a plan to raise funds, with a potential 
bankruptcy just 48 hours away.

'#eurogroup tomorrow 6pm will be in 
Brussels. #cyprus,' read a tweet from Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch 
Finance minister who is also president of the Eurogroup - the 17 
euro-zone national finance ministers.

Cyprus has been told it must raise 
5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) in order to secure 10 billion euros in 
rescue loans from other European countries that use the single currency,
and from the International Monetary Fund.

The country's lawmakers soundly 
rejected an unpopular initial plan that would have seized up to 10 
per cent of people's bank accounts, and is now seeking a way to raise the
desperately needed money.

Time is running out fast. The 
European Central Bank has said it will stop providing emergency funding 
to Cyprus' banks after Monday if no new plan is in place.

Without ECB's support, Cypriot banks 
would collapse on Tuesday, pushing the country toward bankruptcy and a 
potential exit from the 17-nation eurozone.

Out in force: Cypriot authorities are putting the final touches to a plan they hope will convince international lenders to provide the money the country urgently needs

Banks have been shut all week while the plan is put into place, and are not due to reopen until next Tuesday.

Representatives of the IMF, ECB and 
European Commission - collectively known as the troika - met with Sarris
and other officials in the Finance Ministry throughout the morning, 
negotiating several new laws, including a crucial bill that would impose
some form of a tax on bank deposits.

The details were still being worked 
out, but officials have said that the tax could apply to deposits in the
country's top two lenders, which were most exposed to bad Greek debt, 
or even all banks.

Troika consent is essential as they 
will determine whether the plan that the Cypriots come up with would 
meet the requirements for the bailout before it is presented to the 
eurozone finance ministers for final approval.

A eurogroup meeting of the finance 
ministers is expected to be held in Brussels over the weekend, and 
Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades was also to fly there, potentially 
as early as Saturday.

'Significant progress has been made 
toward an agreement at least with the troika which will report to the 
Eurogroup,' Sarris told reporters after the initial morning meeting at 
his ministry.

'Two or three issues need further 
work, issues on banks, there are different calculations,' Sarris said. 
'There is the contribution of experts from the private sector.'

The experts would hold consultations 
amongst themselves and officials would resume negotiations with the 
troika again later Saturday afternoon.

'We have a number of experts that are
working from the private sector, at the Central Bank, at the Ministry 
of Finance trying to iron out these details so that when we do reach an 
agreement there will be no room for different understanding or 
misrepresentation.'

Nicosia made a significant step 
towards cementing a new plan Friday night, when its lawmakers approved 
nine bills, including three crucial ones that will restructure ailing 
banks, restrict financial transactions in emergencies and set up a 
'solidarity fund' that will act as the vehicle for raising funds from 
investments and contributions.

The bank restructuring will include 
the country's troubled second largest lender, Laiki, which suffered 
heavy losses after being exposed to toxic Greek debt.

The restructuring of Laiki and the 
sale of the toxic-asset laden Greek branches of Cypriot banks is 
expected to cut the amount the country needs to raise to about 3 billion
euros instead of 5.8 billion euros, officials have said.

Other banks may also be included in 
the restructuring, such as the country's largest lender, Bank of Cyprus,
which was also exposed to Greek debt.

'We have to be clear to protect the financial system and for banks to open Tuesday with a clear picture,' Sarris said.
