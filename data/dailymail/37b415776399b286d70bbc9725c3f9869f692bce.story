Ukip leader: Nigel Farage's personal approval rating has slipped below that of the Prime Minister

Nigel Farage's approval rating and his party's popularity have both slipped, a poll found today.

The survey also gave Labour a seven-point lead over the Tories with 36 per cent, an increase of two points on a fortnight ago, while the Tories sat unchanged on 29 per cent.

Meanwhile the UK Independence Party (Ukip) were down three on 16 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 6 per cent, according to the Opinium poll for The Observer.

Ukip leader Mr Farage's personal approval rating has slipped below that of Prime Minister David Cameron following a series of damaging headlines for the Eurosceptic party.

His net approval rating - the percentage of voters who approve of his performance minus those who disapprove - fell to -17 per cent, eight points lower than a fortnight ago and the lowest recorded for him by Opinium.

Mr Cameron's rating fell by two points to -11 per cent, while Ed Miliband's improved by three points to -28 per cent, with Nick Clegg down one point on -48 per cent.

Since the last Opinium poll Mr Farage has faced criticism for comments about breastfeeding in which he suggested that mothers should be willing to ‘sit in the corner’ in restaurants while feeding babies to avoid offending people.

Compared: The Opinium poll for The Observer puts Labour on 36%, an increase of two points on a fortnight ago, with the Tories unchanged on 29%, Ukip down three on 16% and the Liberal Democrats on 6%

The party has also been hit by the resignation of would-be South Basildon and East Thurrock MP Kerry Smith over a leaked recording of him making derogatory comments.

Opinium Research carried out an online survey of 1,957 adults in Britain aged 18 or over between 16 and December 19. Results were weighted to nationally-representative criteria.

Labour’s general election strategy chief Douglas Alexander claimed the Tories had been ‘exposing themselves as a party intent on slashing back public services to levels not seen since the 1930s’.

Sex education policy confusion

Dec 3: Nigel Farage: 'I've never advocated that policy. If somebody in Ukip in the past did, well, so be it, but I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.' The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.'

Ostentatious breastfeeding

Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

Weeding out the lunatics

Dec 14: Ukip candidates chief David Soutter: 'Half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand, it is weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.' 

Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments
