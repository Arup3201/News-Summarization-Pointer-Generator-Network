Gaston may be known for his muscular physique, but the brawny actor who plays the villain at Disney World has lost an arm wrestling challenge to an 11-year-old girl.

The Beauty and the Beast character, who recently made headlines for beating an adult male park visitor in a push-up contest, can be seen testing his strength against this latest contender at Walt Disney World’s Fantasyland in Orlando, Florida, in a YouTube video uploaded by Peyton Kays.

Peyton explained: 'My little sister decided to challenge Gaston to an arm wrestling contest, but none of us knew she had this tactic up her sleeve!'

As the brave girl approaches Gaston and challenges him to the match, he warns her that he's the arm-wrestling champion of his town.

He adds: 'I’ve been champion since the day I was born. The doctor tried to check me for a pulse, ten seconds later they were checking him for a pulse. I don't think you want to do this.'

However, his opponent uses a clever maneuver, pulling her hand from his grip and licking it before slapping down the hands of a surprised Gaston.

Angry loser: 'Disgraced...publicly humiliated again. Girl, that doesn't even count, you're cheating,' Gaston said

'Disgraced...publicly humiliated again. Girl, that doesn't even count; you're cheating. If I had done that to you, you'd still be passed out from swooning,' he angrily tells her.

The video has garnered more than 1.6 million views since it was posted on YouTube January 6.

Gaston has become quite an Internet sensation over the past month.

Straight talk: A sassy little girl named Isabella took Gaston to task in another viral video, telling him: 'You think you're pretty strong? I think I'm stronger than you'

Park-goer Blake Platt recently challenged the buff hunter to a push-up contest, telling him: 'You think you're pretty strong? I think I'm stronger than you.'

In the YouTube clip, which Mr Platt posted on January 2, Gaston quickly outpaces his over-confident rival, even launching into a series of rapid one-arm push-ups.

And in December, a sassy little girl named Isabella took Gaston to task in another viral video, telling him that the Beast, his character's nemesis from the 1991 Disney film, was her favorite character.

When Gaston arrogantly claimed that he would marry Belle, the movie's heroine, Isabella shot him down, shouting: 'No, no, no! The Beast is marrying Belle.'
