Killed in the line of duty: Brentwood Police officer Stephen Arkell, pictured in 2013, was shot dead by Michael Nolan, authorities said

The cop shot just before an explosion tore through a New Hampshire house Monday on live television has died, authorities said.

Steve Arkell, 48, was shot dead in front of the Brentwood home that had been burning for about 15 minutes before it exploded and suspect Michael Nolan, 47, died in the fire, police said.

Arkell was a 15-year veteran of the Brentwood Police Department and a father of two teenage daughters, according to WBZ.

'Officer Arkell bravely answered the call of duty and made the ultimate sacrifice, a heroic demonstration of his commitment to the safety of his fellow citizens,' Governor Maggie Hassan said in a statement.

'Officer Arkell courageously put his 
life on the line to protect others, and in doing so, was tragically 
taken far too soon,' she added.

It is not clear if Michael Nolan is survived by family other than his father and siblings.

Inferno: The home then burned uncontrollably until firefighters were able to arrive

The choppers that caught the explosion were there after police and
 SWAT officers responded to the house after being called by neighbors 
who heard gunshots, WCVB reported.

Police arrived just before 5.00 p.m., according to the station. A person was seen on WBZ footage being wheeled away from the scene on a stretcher, it is not clear who that person was.

Arkell was shot dead in front of the home, and another officer entered the house but 'was driven out by gunfire, New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph Foster said at a Monday evening press conference.

The fire is believed to have started on the duplex’s second floor, according to reports.

It burned for about 15 minutes before an explosion blew through the roof and sent a large chunk of the home, in a 55 and older community for seniors, flying towards a wooded area.

The fire soon turned into a raging inferno and appeared to burn out of control until the home was nothing but a pile of burning wood.

Several firefighters valiantly fought the inferno but were unable to save the house.

The ordeal is reported by the Union Leader to have begun when the home’s owner, 86-year-old Walter Nolan, began arguing with Michael Nolan.

Michael Nolan is believed to have attacked his father, who was then taken away by police, a neighbor told the paper.

Michael Nolan is believed to be the person who exchanged gunfire with police outside before the fire started, Foster said.

Embers that ignited a fire in the woods in back of the home have been put out, and there does not appear to be any risk to the home next door.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has joined the New Hampshire State Police in investigating the crime scene, the investigation remains ongoing.
