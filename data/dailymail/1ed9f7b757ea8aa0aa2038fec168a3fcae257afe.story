The number of cyclists injured by motorists suddenly opening a car door in their path has soared by a quarter in just two years, shocking new figures show.

Almost 600 cyclists were knocked off their bikes trying to swerve around a car door in 2011, up from around 400 in 2009.

Safety campaigners called for better education for drivers to look in their mirrors before stepping out into the road.

The number of cyclists injured by open car doors has soared by 25 per cent in two years

Transport minister Stephen Hammond told MailOnline motorists had to ‘take care’ when opening their door to make sure cyclists are not trying to overtake them.

In 2011, a total of 595 cyclists were injured on Britain’s roads after either hitting or trying to swerve around an open door. Of the total, one cyclist died while 92 suffered ‘serious injuries’.

Just two years earlier, 55 suffered serious injuries while 413 received injures described as ‘slight’. No-one was killed.

Details of the numbers of cyclists injured, by severity, in reported personal injury road accidents in Great Britain, as a result of hitting an open door of a vehicle, or as a result of a vehicle door being opened or closed negligently were released in Parliament.

Labour MP Barry Sheerman, chairman of Parliamentary Advisory Council on Transport Safety (PACTS) who obtained the figures, said drivers had to get used to an explosion in the popularity of cycling.

He said: ‘Cycling is very popular. It has come back again. All over the world, and certainly western Europe, it is fashionable again to cycle.

Labour MP Barry Sheerman said drivers should have more training to spot cyclists in their mirrors

‘It is true there are more cyclists but there are people who are not trained enough to look in their mirrors.

‘It is an education challenge, we have got to raise awareness. It is much more likely that there is a quiet cyclist coming past you.’

PACTS is to launch a transport safety commission which will take evidence on how to reduce cut injuries and deaths on Britain’s roads.

Mr Sheerman added: ‘There are worries about these figures. The number of serious injuries is up to more than 90 - a serious injury means you never walk without pain again.’

The number of people cycling to work is up 17 per cent, a report said last week.

The popularity of commuting by bike has increased by 760,000 in England and Wales in the past ten years, a detailed analysis by Halfords of the latest census statistics revealed.

It reflects the huge interest in cycling promoted by the likes of Tour de France winner and Olympic hero Bradley Wiggins and fellow racers such as golden girls Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott.

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘Cycling is good for your health and helps to reduce congestion so it’s great that more people are travelling on two wheels.  It is vital that drivers take care to look out for cyclists, whether they are in a parking space or on the move, as well as leaving them plenty of room on the road.

‘The Government is investing an extra £107 million in cycling infrastructure, including £35 million to tackle dangerous junctions.

‘We also launched our THINK! Let’s Look Out For Each Other campaign and are making it easier for councils to install trixi mirrors so drivers are better able to see cyclists.’

Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Chris Boardman (left) last week launched 'Crossrail for the Bike' - which will see a huge cycle highway run through London London

Mr Johnson wants to make it safer for cyclists by separating them from cars on the road. The 'Crossrail' would run past the Victoria Embankment and travel from east to west through the capital

Amid fears about the dangers cyclists face, Boris Johnson last week unveiled a £1billion plan to build a huge cycle path through London to move hose on two wheels away from heavy traffic.

The segregated route will run for more than 15 miles from the western suburbs through the heart of London to Canary Wharf and Barking.

It will use new Dutch-style segregated cycle tracks along, among other places, the Victoria Embankment and the Westway flyover.

The London Mayor said: ‘'Our new routes will give people the confidence to get in the saddle.’
