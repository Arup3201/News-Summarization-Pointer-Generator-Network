A fashion photographer who was asked by designer Alexander McQueen to take a special series of backstage photographs 11 years ago is showcasing the images in a dramatic tableau for the first time.

Nick Knight says the renowned designer invited him to take the snaps at his iconic McQueen Black Event in 2004.

The London show featured an atmospheric showcase of black pieces, some from the archive and others designed specifically for the night.

Now using material he shot backstage at the event, Mr Knight has now created the unique image called Black, collating the previously unseen photographs of 35 outfits modelled by Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Gemma Ward and Lily Cole among others.

Mr Knight says he was asked by McQueen to photograph each model backstage with a view to creating a composite image for the future, and now, more than a decade later, the designer’s vision has now been realised.

Mr Knight said: ‘As a close collaborator and friend of McQueen, I had the honour of filming many of his photo shoots from the mid-Nineties onwards.’

'McQueen was so excited as he neared the completion of the collection for the American Express Black event, he insisted we found a way to shoot it behind the scenes at Earls Court where the show was being held.

'He knew the Black Event was an important moment that should be preserved and shown to the world, so this project has been a great way for me to reflect upon and celebrate our working relationship.

‘We both knew we had the ingredients to make an incredible image.’

The image, commissioned by American Express, has been released to coincide with the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty exhibition currently showing at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Lisa Gregg, vice president, American Express, said: ‘Alexander McQueen was renowned for pushing creative boundaries and this was always demonstrated through his legendary work. American Express supported McQueen in his early years as a trailblazing creative, and was privileged to accompany him on the meteoric rise from cutting edge designer to global name.

‘Our partnership with the V&A and the Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty retrospective has given us an exciting opportunity to work with Nick again and to commission this beautiful image, which is a wonderful tribute to our past collaborations with McQueen.’

McQueen was one of the UK's most controversial fashion stars, a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs.

The retrospective of his work at the V&A features items taken from his ground-breaking 1992 MA collection shown alongside his last.

Savage Beauty, which runs until August 2, includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by McQueen's friends, among them stylist Katy England. 

The tableaux, called Black, have been released to complement the Alexander McQueen:Savage Beauty retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London

McQueen, who was found dead on the 11 February 2010, was one of the UK's most influential designers at the time of his death and was the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors.

The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters.

After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career.

McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter.

Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow.

From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans.

The same year, he was appointed creative director at Givenchy, replacing fellow Briton John Galliano, and relocated to Paris. But despite his success, McQueen never forgot his London roots, often speaking of his love for the British capital.

Indeed, he once spoke of how inspiring he found the V&A itself, saying: 'The collections at the V&A never fail to intrigue and inspire me. The nation is privileged to have access to such a resource... it's the sort of place I'd like to be shut in overnight.'

The museum repaid the compliment, first by including the designer's work in Cutting Edge: 50 Years of British Fashion in 1997, and then again in its Fashion in Motion series.

But it is the new Savage Beauty retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of McQueen's work hosted by the museum, with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show.

Among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection, as well as some of his A/W10 designs - the last the designer would ever create.

His final collection was never completed, with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in Paris a month after he died. But while McQueen might be gone, his brand lives on and, in the capable hands of his former assistant Sarah Burton, continues to go from strength to strength.

'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired,' she explains. 'He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless. Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.'

'I am thrilled to announce that the V&A will bring this wonderful exhibition to London to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times,' adds V&A director Martin Roth.

'Lee Alexander McQueen was brought up in London, studied here and based his globally successful McQueen fashion brand here – by staging the exhibition at the V&A it feels like we are bringing his work home.'

Dramatic:  McQueen was famous for producing pieces that erred on the side of gothic such as these three dresses
