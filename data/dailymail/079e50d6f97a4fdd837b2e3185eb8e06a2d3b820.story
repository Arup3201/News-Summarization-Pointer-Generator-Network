Just a few years ago, finding an England football fan openly supporting the German team would have been almost unheard of.

So it is perhaps surprising that, for tomorrow's World Cup final, English fans are flocking to support the old rival Germany against a newer rival in Argentina.

Sir Geoff Hurst , England's hat-trick hero of 1966, has already pledged his support, as has UK Prime Minister David Cameron. 

In a final between two old enemies of English football, English fans seem to be backing old rivals Germany over newer adversaries Argentina

The two countries have plenty of history when it comes to their relationship with England, both on and off the field.

It was Germany who knocked England out of the last World Cup, beating Capello's side 4-1, inflicting England's heaviest World Cup defeat thanks in part to a disallowed goal from Frank Lampard.

It was Germany that England beat 4-2 in 1966 to win the World Cup, thanks to two controversial goals from Hurst - one which bounced off the inside of the cross bar and on to the goal line, and another at the end of extra time as fans were streaming on to the pitch.

Of course, in terms of real-world rivalries, the two World Wars are what made Germany into the enemy in the first place.

Meanwhile, on the Argentine side, the Falklands war and the still-bitter argument over the islands has done nothing to endear English minds to the prospect of an Argentine win.

On the pitch, Diego Maradona's 'hand of God' moment, when he scored against England from an unpenalised handball in 1986, still sticks in the memory, as does the memory of Diego Simeone hitting the turf after being tapped on the leg by David Beckham in 1998.

Given the animosity that most England supporters feel towards the two nations, it is almost a shame that they cannot both lose.

But when it comes to picking a winner, it seems that the English are choosing to back the Europeans over the South Americans.

For German fans, a win tomorrow would put an end to their status as perennial nearly-men, making the semi finals or finals of the last four World Cups without a win

If Argentina were to emerge victorious it would mark the third World Cup win in the country's history

Hurst told the Sun on Sunday: 'I know England supporters will be shocked to see me backing the Germans but they are the tournament's best team.

'They are a great football nation - very much like us in that they are determined, strong and proud.'

While the Argentinians are capable of playing with flair and style, particularly their star man Lionel Messi, the Germans play a solid  style of football, more akin to the English way. 

There may also be a sense of underdog spirit to backing the team, since the Germans have been pegged as perennial nearly-men, reaching the final or semi-final of the last four tournaments without a win.

David Cameron is also lending his support to our European neighbours, though it has been suggested that this in only to curry favour with Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Mr Cameron was rooting for Holland to beat Messi and Co. in last night's crunch semi final and had been texting the country's prime minister Mark Rutte 'furiously'.

But after the Dutch crashed out in a penalty shoot out, Mr Cameron has turned his support to the Germans.
