More than 5,000 servicemen and women have perished fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade. Each one of them has left behind grief-stricken parents, siblings, spouses and children - as well as bedrooms frozen in time.

In his new book Bedrooms of the Fallen, award-winning photographer Ashley Gilbertson reminds us that those young men and women were not just statistics reported on CNN - they were full-fledged individuals with hobbies, interests and passions reflected in the haunting black and white images of their old rooms. 

The parents of the fallen have left the 
bedrooms just as they were, creating the unsettling illusion that at any
 moment, their son or daughter could come through the door and resume 
their lives.

Long Island pride: Marine Cpl. Christopher Scherer's room in East Northport, New York, is filled with stickers and pennants celebrating his college, Hofstra University, and local sports teams

Far-flung locales: New York City-based photojournalist Ashley Gilbertson has travelled to more than a dozen cities in the U.S., Canada and Europe, including Bitetto, Italy, where he captured Corporal Luigi Pascazio's old bedroom

Rare glimpse: Each room in Gilbertson's collection is a window on the life of the soldier who once occupied it, among them Army Spc. Ryan Yurchison's childhood room in Middletown, Ohio, with an American flag shaped into a triangle sitting on his bed

Each room in Gilbertson's collection is a window on the life of the soldier who once occupied it, with high school diplomas adorning the walls, football helmets, old pictures, knickknacks and childhood toys.

So far, the New York City-based photojournalist has travelled to more than a dozen cities and towns in the U.S., Canada and Europe, capturing the rooms of 40 men and women between the ages of 18 and 27 who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan.   

The bedroom of Corporal Luigi Pascazio in his native Bitetto, Italy, which he likely once shared with a sibling, has a pair of beds with pillowcases bearing a photo of the 24-year-old who was killed by a roadside bomb in May 2010 near Herart, Afghanistan. 

Army Pfc. Karina Lau died when her 
helicopter was shot down by insurgents in November 2003, in Falluja, 
Iraq. She may have been a warrior on the battlefield, but the 
20-year-old was also just a girl: her old room in Livingston, 
California, contains plush animals on the bed covered with a flowery 
spread, and whimsical figurines lining the bookshelves.

Never forgotten: Marine Cpl. Christopher G. Scherer (left), 21, was killed by a sniper on July 21, 2007, in Karmah, Iraq. He was from East Northport, New York; Corporal Luigi Pascazio (right), 24, from Bitetto, Italy, was killed by a roadside bomb in May 2010 near Herart, Afghanistan

Tragic final act: Army Pfc. Richard P. Langenbrunner (left), 19, committed suicide on April 17, 2007 in Rustimayah, Iraq. He was from Fort Wayne, Indiana; Army Spc. Ryan Yurchison (right), 27, from Middletown, Ohio, returned from a tour of duty in Iraq suffering from PTSD and died from a drug overdose in his dealer's house in 2010

Marine Cpl. Christopher Scherer, 21, was a true Long Islander. Inside his room in East Northport, New York, the walls are plastered with stickers and pennants celebrating his college - Hofstra University - and local sports teams.

In Army Spc. Ryan Yurchison's childhood room in Middletown, Ohio, an American flag shaped into a triangle sits on his bed next to a stuffed Kuala bear, surrounded by music posters, a photo of the soldier with his comrades and an assortment of bubbleheads.

The 27-year-old returned from a tour of duty in Iraq suffering from PTSD, which resulted in his death from a drug overdose in his dealer's house in 2010.

The parents of Marine Cpl. Jennifer Parcell have been lovingly watering the plants filling their daughter's bedroom in their home in Bel Air, Maryland. On her bedstand sits a small Buddha figurine next to a vase with fresh flowers; on the adjacent wall hangs a poster celebrating the U.S. Marines.

Girly girl: Army Pfc. Karina Lau may have been a warrior, but the 20-year-old was also a just girl: her old room in Livingston, California, is filled with plush animals seated on the bed covered with a flowery spread

Hallowed ground: Gilbertson said in the beginning it was difficult to convince grieving parents to open their homes to a stranger and allow him into their late child's room. Here is pictured the bedroom of Marine Cpl. Jennifer Parcell, 20, in Bel Air, Maryland

Team player: Army Cpl. Matthew Emerson's room in Grandview, Washington, is lovingly decorated with photos of his high school football team

Jennifer was only 20 when an explosion set off by a suicide bomber claimed her life in 2007 in Anbar, Afghanistan.

Looking at Army Cpl. Matthew Emerson's inner sanctum in Grandview, Washington, there is no doubt that this greatest passion was football.

The 20-year-old, who died when his vehicle rolled over on September 18, 2007, in Mosul, Iraq, decorated the walls with photos of his high school football team, and even his bedspread is striped like a gridiron.

It was not by accident that Ashley Gilbertson chose to do a project focusing on fallen soldiers.

In 2002, he traveled to Iraq to cover the looming war for the New York Times. But taking photographs for the newspaper left him unsatisfied because he felt that the public back home was disengaged from what was happening in the Middle Eastern country thousands of miles away.

After he returned home, Gilbertson came across a series of photos published in the Times featuring pictures of servicemen and women who died fighting in Afghanistan.

Women at war: Army Pfc. Karina S. Lau (left), 20, died when her helicopter was shot down by insurgents on Nov. 2, 2003, in Falluja, Iraq; Marine Cpl. Jennifer M. Parcell (right), 20, was killed by a suicide bomber on February 7, 2007 in Anbar province, Iraq

America's finest: Air Force Airman First Class Carl L. Anderson Jr. (left), 21, was killed by an IED on August 29, 2004, in Mosul, Iraq; Army Cpl. Matthew J. Emerson (right), 20, was killed when his vehicle rolled over on September 18, 2007 in Mosul, Iraq

Too young: Army Lt. Brian N. Bradshaw, 24, was killed in an IED attack on June 25, 2009 in Kheyl, Afghanistan

The series gave his wife an idea for him to reach out to the families of fallen soldiers and capture their bedrooms.

Speaking to Slate Magazine, Gilbertson said in the beginning it was tough to convince grieving parents to open their homes to a stranger and allow him into the private space of their son or daughter.

‘The job of parents when their child was alive to protect the child any way they could. When parents lose their child all they have is a memory and they turn to protecting that memory,’ he said. ‘Having someone come into the home and sharing that memory with the rest of the world is a huge leap of faith.’

Some of the rooms featured in the book were left exactly as they were, while others were tidied up by the parents.

Private shrine: Gilbertson said he made sure not to touch anything in the rooms so as not to disturb the peace of the fallen; here pictured is the bedroom of Air Force Airman First Class Carl Anderson Jr, 21, in Georgetown, South Carolina

A different kid of tribute: Ashley Gilbertson was inspired to create the book of photos because he wanted to show the real flesh-and-blood people behind the casualty count, among them Army Lt. Brian Bradshaw, 24, from Steilacoom, Washington (room pictured)

Passions and interests: Army Pfc. Richard Langenbrunner, 19, from Fort Wayne, Indiana, was obviously a sci-fi and fantasy fan, as the posters on the walls would attest

Self-editing: Gilbertson has learned from soldiers that they often tidy up their rooms before deployments to remove items they would not want their parents to find if they do not come back

Gilbertson said he has learned from his soldier friends that they often do some cleaning themselves before deployment, removing items they would not want their parents to find should they be killed.

The photojournalist explained that the decision to photograph the rooms in black and white was inspired by his desire to make them seem as neutral as possible, thus allowing each soldier's personality to shine through.

Fearing to disturb the peace of these hallowed spaces, Gilbertson said he made a point of not touching anything inside - not even the light switches.

'I felt I was in some historic memorial,' he told the magazine.
