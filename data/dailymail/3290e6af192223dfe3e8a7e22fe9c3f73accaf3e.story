A Liberian boy who danced his way through the horrifying ordeal of coming down with killer disease Ebola and cheered up his fellow patients has made a full recovery and been discharged from the camp.

Mamadee Sayon, 11, was battling the disease at a Doctors Without Borders case management centre in Foya.

This heart-warming video shows how he brought a smile to the faces of all his fellow sufferers by dancing away the pain and always remaining in high spirits.

Just dance: Dancing Ebola patient Mamadee Sayon, 11, has recovered from the disease and been discharged

He's got moves: Mamadee cheered up all the other patients with his high spirits and constant boogying

Nothing could break down his positive energy - Mamadee's sister was also admitted to the camp, and tragically passed away after a few days, but he remained determined to keep cheering everyone up.

Even two weeks after his admission, Mamadee was still dancing, and now he has become one of the lucky few to recover from the devastating disease and be discharged.

Around two-thirds of the patients at the Foya camp die from the virus.

President Obama this week described the Ebola outbreak in West Africa as ‘a threat to global security’. 

His warning was echoed by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who said the epidemic could become a ‘global catastrophe with disastrous consequences’ without more humanitarian support.

The US President announced plans this week to send 3,000 American troops to the region to help build new healthcare facilities. 

'Today thousands of people in West Africa are infected. That number could rapidly grow to tens of thousands. And if the outbreak is not stopped now we could be looking at hundreds of thousands infected,' he said.

'This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security. It’s a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic.' 

Around 2,500 people have now died from the virus in West Africa.
