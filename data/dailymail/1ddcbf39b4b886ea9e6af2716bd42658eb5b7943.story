The chameleon’s ability to change colour and blend into the background is famous.

Now engineers have created artificial ‘skin’ that could one day be used to make soldiers’ uniforms and give them the same ability as the colourful reptile.

The incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand, by  bending it.

Researchers say the new material offers intriguing possibilities for an entirely new class of display technologies, colour-shifting camouflage, and sensors that could detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings, bridges and aircraft.

‘This is the first time anybody has made a flexible chameleon-like skin that can change colour simply by flexing it,’ said Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain, a member of the University of California Berkeley team that developed the material.

They made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair.

The markings enabled them to select the range of colours the material would reflect, depending on how it was flexed and bent.

Chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival.

The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores.

Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays, but they also protect it from overheating.

It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells.

The colours we see in paints and fabrics, for example, occur when white broad spectrum light strikes their surfaces.

The unique chemical composition of each surface then absorbs various bands, or wavelengths of light.

Bands that aren’t absorbed are reflected back, with shorter wavelengths giving objects a blue hue and longer wavelengths appearing redder, with a rainbow of possible combinations in between.

While autumn leaves change colour because of a shift in their chemical make-up, the researchers say they can transform the shade of their material by controlling the surface features on the tiniest of scales so they interact and reflect particular wavelengths of light.

Professor Chang-Hasnain said that such ‘structural colour’ is much less common in nature, but is used by some butterflies and beetles to create a an iridescent display.

To make the material, the Berkeley team etched rows of ridges onto a thin layer of silicon, which was set into a layer of silicone for flexibility.

Rather than spreading the light into a complete rainbow, the ridges reflect a specific wavelength of light.

Other applications for the new material include new types of advertising boards, active camouflage coatings for cars and sensors that could chnage colour to indicate structural fatigue in bridges, for example. A stock image of Crescent City Connection Bridge in New Orleans is shown

By ‘tuning’ the spaces between the ridges, Professor Chang-Hasnain said it is possible to select the specific colour to be reflected.

They realised it would be possible to subtly shift the spaces between the ridges, and therefore the colour, by flexing or bending the material.

As the silicone is bent or flexed, the gaps between the ridges respond .

Professor Chang-Hasnain said: ‘If you have a surface with very precise structures, spaced so they can interact with a specific wavelength of light, you can change its properties and how it interacts with light by changing its dimensions.’

The study, published in the journal Optica, says the material is easy to manufacture with the desired surface properties and is able to reflect very pure colours, reflecting up to 83 per cent of the incoming light.

So far the experts have created a piece of material that’s one square centimetre, so more time and research is needed before clothes can be created, for example.

Professor Chang-Hasnain said: ‘The next step is to make this larger-scale and there are facilities already that could do so.

‘At that point, we hope to be able to find applications in entertainment, security, and monitoring.’

She said the chameleon material to make a new type of billboard as well as create an active camouflage on the exterior of vehicles that would change colour to better match the surrounding environment.

It could also be used to make sensors that would change colour to indicate that structural fatigue was stressing critical components on bridges, buildings, or the wings of airplanes.

‘This is the first time anyone has achieved such a broad range of colour on a one-layer, thin and flexible surface. I think it’s extremely cool,’ she said.
