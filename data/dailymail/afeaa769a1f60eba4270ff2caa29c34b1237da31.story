These are some of the young  party-goers at the illegal rave where 16-year-old Daniel Spargo-Mabbs took a fatal dose of ecstasy.

Many of the teenagers are seen with the legal high ‘hippy crack’ and some appear to be casually passing substances to one another.

Daniel, whose last words to his parents were ‘I promise I won’t die’, suffered a heart attack at the gathering on an industrial estate in Hayes, West London, on Friday. He died two days later in hospital.

Last night his father Tim, 50, who believes it was the first time his son had taken ecstasy, gave a stark warning to teenagers about the dangers of drugs.

‘We want to say to any child tempted to take any illegal drugs, talk to us first. We’ll tell you about the machines, the hospital, the ventilator, the whole shebang.

‘We don’t want this to happen to anybody else.’

More than 3,000 revellers were at the event, which was put on by a secretive group called ‘Vibes Family’. 

It uses a series of web-based email addresses and pay-as-you-go mobile phones with recorded messages to direct partygoers to its illegal raves by giving a postcode and address for the venue just hours beforehand.

Party times: Pictures of the rave were posted online by the organisers

This cloak-and-dagger operation makes it harder for the police  and local councils to find the  rave locations.

Despite Daniel’s death, the group – whose logo features a cartoon mushroom character – yesterday posted photographs of smiling and dancing revellers from the Hayes event on its Facebook page.

In a series of pictures, youngsters can be seen smoking, drinking and inhaling ‘hippy crack’,  better known as nitrous oxide or laughing gas.

The legal high is increasingly popular and a recent survey suggested that as many as 350,000  16 to 24-year-olds have tried it.

Victim: Daniel Spargo-Mabbs took a fatal dose of ecstasy

Inhaled from balloons, the drug is said to make people feel ‘euphoric and relaxed’ – but drug experts warn it can cause death through suffocation. Prince Harry was spotted inhaling the drug at a party three years ago.

Other photographs showed at least one young woman smoking what appeared to be a ‘spliff’, or cannabis cigarette. The image was later removed.

In another photograph three young men appear to be pouring a substance from a plastic bag into a bottle of Coca-Cola. An ecstasy tablet is thought to have been responsible for Daniel’s death.

A freelance first aider hired to attend the event, Richard Chaplain, said: ‘A partygoer came over and said a young man had collapsed. We went over immediately to see him and I knew straight away that he looked in serious trouble. I insisted we call an ambulance straight away.’ 

The 16-year-old from Croydon, South London, had told his parents he was going to a party in Clapham, South London, but instead made his way to the rave.

After he failed to return home, his parents Fiona and Tim’s worst fears were realised when police called at their house at 5.30am on Saturday to inform them that Daniel had been rushed to hospital.

His reaction to the drug had sent his temperature soaring to 42C – and then caused him to have a heart attack.

The bright pupil, who attended Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England School in Croydon,  was predicted to gain excellent  A-level results.

His long-term girlfriend Jenna Coombs, who attended the same school, was being comforted by friends yesterday.

Arrested: Ryan Kirk has been remanded in custody after appearing in court on drug charges

Two alleged drug dealers suspected of supplying ecstasy to Daniel Spargo-Mabbs appeared in court yesterday over the allegations.

Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, from Beckenham, were both charged with being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

The pair were remanded in custody after appearing at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court yesterday.

They will appear at Isleworth Crown Court on February 5.

The two men were arrested after Daniel's death, along with a 19-year-old who has been bailed until March.

Supplying class A drugs such as ecstasy is punishable by life in prison and an unlimited fine, while possession of the substances can be punished by a seven-year jail sentence.
