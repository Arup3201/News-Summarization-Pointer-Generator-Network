Viewers of the Eurovision Song Contest might have noticed over the years that the winning song is rarely the best.

And while critics of the contest have suggested the outcome is driven by prejudice and is stitched-up at the UK’s expense, scientists have discovered other 'hidden' voting patterns.

They found that votes are based on a combination of loyalties tied up with culture, geography, history and migration.

Nil point for discrimination! Abba might have won the Eurovision Song Contest (pictured) in 1974 with a cracking song, but a study has found that hidden voting patterns play a part in deciding the winner. People's votes are driven by loyalties based on culture, geography, history and migration - but not discrimination

The study said people’s votes are based on loyalties based on culture, geography, history and migration and not discrimination.

‘Our analysis found no convincing evidence of negative bias or discrimination against anyone - no country really has any enemies,’ the London-based statisticians said.

Migration patterns might be an explanation for why some countries often vote for certain others.

In line with previous findings, the data suggests that voting congregates within four broad groups of nations that tend to give each other points.

The model also revealed the presence of repeated voting behaviour over the years.

Statisticians at University College London (UCL) and Imperial College London analysed voting patterns over the past two decades to identify the patterns and found no evidence to support Sir Terry Wogan’s criticism that the contest is marred by blatant bias and discrimination.

Instead they think migration can tip the balance in favour of musical acts from certain countries, which will compete to win this year’s Eurovision on May 10.

‘Migration seems to be an interesting explanation for some of the patterns that we see in the data,’ said Dr Gianluca Baio of UCL.

‘For example, Turkey seems to be scored highly by German voters, possibly due to the large number of Turkish people who have migrated to Germany, and potentially tele-vote from there.

‘But our analysis found no convincing evidence of negative bias or discrimination against anyone - no country really has any enemies.’

Imperial’s Marta Blangiardo analysed how countries have given points to each other since Eurovision introduced tele-voting in 1998.

In the study, published in the Journal of Applied Statistics, the duo used computer analysis to reveal clusters of countries with similar voting behaviours and identified the probability of each country belonging to a particular voting bloc in any particular year.

In line with previous findings, the data suggests that voting congregates within four broad groups of nations that tend to give each other points: one combining the former Yugoslavia, Switzerland and Austria, one covering central and southern Europe; plus a larger bloc which includes the former Soviet bloc as well as the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia, which divides more-or-less randomly into two groups each year.

‘In our analysis we used what we call a “Bayesian hierarchical formulation” to model the scores,’ said Dr Blangiardo.

‘We took into account factors like the language of the song and the gender of the singer both of which have known effects on the votes. This left behind an underlying trend for us to measure.

‘This trend is based on cultural and geographical similarities, as well as migrations of people.’

The model also revealed the presence of repeated voting behaviour over the years, but the researchers said that data can only suggest whether there is bias.

‘To prove something stronger like “discrimination” or “favouritism”, we would need more complex data, for example polling on people’s motivations for voting the way they do,’ Dr Baio said.

Looking at the results country by country, Greece seems to be systematically favoured by its close neighbours Cyprus and Albania, amidst a general delivery of positive votes, which is thought to be driven by widespread migrations of Greek citizens across Europe.

The UK has friends, in the form of Ireland, Malta and Italy. However the effect was not substantial in the vast majority of these cases and thus does not have a dramatic impact on the likelihood of a given performer winning.

Negative bias was virtually invisible in the study and the statisticians said that no country systematically gives any other low points - meaning there is no evidence of prejudice or discrimination against anyone.

In the case of Albania, which was consistently relatively unpopular in the voting, the effect was very small and the authors did not consider this to statistically demonstrate a negative bias.   

Despite claims to the contrary, the UK’s entries do not seem to be systematically shunned by the rest of Europe.

‘It is likely that other factors beyond those we have studied explain most of the voting behaviour in the Eurovision Song Contest, as the patterns we observe are relatively weak,’ Dr Baio said.

Hitting a bum note? The UK has friends in the form of Ireland, Malta and Italy. But such alliances were not found to have a dramatic impact on the likelihood of a given performer winning - and were not enough to save the UK's 2003 entry, Jemini (pictured) being awarded nil points
