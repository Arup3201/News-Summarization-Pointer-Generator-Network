He was abandoned at a train station, left with just a suitcase containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy. 

Kai the Shar-Pei crossbreed became the most popular dog in the Scottish SPCA's history after he was found tied to railings outside Ayr station with the case. 

But now, after dozens of offers from across the world to give the animal a new home, Kai has a new owner. 

Ian Russell, 52, was chosen by the Scottish SPCA from a list of hundreds of people who wanted to give him a home.

Kai, the dog found abandoned and tied to railings at a train station with a suitcase containing his belongings, has a new owner in Ian Russell - one of hundreds of people from around the world who offered him a home 

Kai was discovered just after Christmas with the suitcase - containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy

'When I heard about Kai I knew the little guy needed a break but I never thought in a million years I'd get him,' said Mr Russell, a self-employed hydraulic engineer from Newton Mearns in East Renfrewshire.

'I called the Scottish SPCA just to check he was OK and see if there was anything I could do to help. Fast-forward a few weeks and here I am taking him home. I honestly think it was meant to be.' 

Mr Russell's pet Dalmatian died just before Christmas and he said getting Kai was like winning the lottery. 

He added: 'I work all over Scotland, mainly outdoors, driving wherever I'm needed in my van. Kai will come with me and when it's appropriate I'll let him out to run around and play safely while I work. Then we'll jump back into the van together and head to the next place. We'll be able to hang out all the time.' 

Kai was discovered by railway staff on January 2 after an internet sale fell through. He was left there by Fin Rayner who claims she was tricked into buying him on Gumtree. 

The animal was found looking forlorn, tied to a railing and accompanied by a case containing a pillow, toy, food and bowl.

The Shar-Pei crossbreed was taken in by the SSPCA who managed to fundraise to operate on his eyes 

The images of the abandoned dog went round the world and the animal welfare charity said people from as far afield as New York, Canada, Hong Kong, Spain and the Philippines offered to give him a new home. The charity received almost 200 offers to rehome the dog. 

Scottish SPCA animal care assistant Alan Grant said: 'Kai's story was really sad and many people likened him to Paddington Bear, given he was found alone at a railway station with his suitcase.

'One of the reasons we chose Ian was right from the start he said he was interested in rehoming Kai but he would take our advice if we thought one of the many other dogs in our care would suit him better.

Kai was found with a painful eye condition but is now in good health after an operation funded by wellwishers

Mr Russell was chosen to give the animal a home and said getting Kai was just like 'winning the lottery' 

Mr Russell phoned the SSPCA after he learned of Kai's plight and offered to give him a home or help out 

Ian Russell, from Aberdeen, said he never thought he would get Kai because of all the offers to rehome him

'It was really important for us to select an owner who wanted Kai for all the right reasons and had really thought through their decision to take on a rescue dog.

'We know Kai will have a fantastic new life with Ian and we couldn't be happier for him.

'This is a great opportunity for us to remind people that we have hundreds of other animals in our care just like Kai who all need new homes.'

Station staff looked after Kai when he was discovered on January 2, until the Scottish SPCA rescued him 

After he was taken in by the Scottish SPCA Kai needed needed surgery for entropions, inward-curling eyelids. 

The charity set up a JustGiving page to raise money for the dog's £1,000 operation and managed to raise double the target in a day.  

There was also an enthusiastic response on social media, with author Irvine Welsh tweeting: 'If I was in Ayr that boy would be coming home with Welshy. Yes he would! Yes he would!’
