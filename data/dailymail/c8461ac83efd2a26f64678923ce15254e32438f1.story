An odd job man disguised himself as a ghost before battering an 84-year-old man to death and robbing him of £3,000.

Michael Fearon, 57 - a trusted friend of his victim - donned a white dust sheet with eye holes cut in it to lie in wait for widower Vincent Kershaw at his home in Greater Manchester, before pouncing on the terrified pensioner when he returned from a shopping trip.

Fearon burst out of a cupboard dressed in his sinister disguise and beat Mr Kershaw around the head with a rubber mallet, then stole wads of cash from the pensioner's pockets and left him to die.

Retired wagon driver Mr Kershaw, who lived alone and was described as a 'fiercely independent chap', is thought to have lain alone for up to two days before dying of his injuries.

The pensioner was known to carry large amounts of cash on his person.

Police alerted by a tip off over a week later broke into his £80,000 semi in Milnrow, near Rochdale, Greater Manchester and found the elderly man’s body in the kitchen, surrounded by his unpacked shopping bags.

Officers who later arrested Fearon discovered he had regularly done odd jobs for Mr Kershaw, who had trusted him enough to give him a spare set of keys to his house.

The killer - a compulsive gambler who had mounting debts - later attended his victim’s funeral with mourners unaware of his secret.

Fearon, of Timbercliffe, Littleborough, Lancashire, is facing life in jail after admitting murder on the first day of his trial at Manchester Crown Court yesterday.

Investigation: Police acting on a tip-off discovered Mr Kershaw's body in the kitchen of his home more than a week after the attack on October 4

Judge Michael Henshell told Fearon: 'You knew that Mr Kershaw was an easy target and you used your knowledge of Mr Kershaw's habits to plan your robbery.

'Although you are almost thirty years younger and strongly built, you decided that you needed to incapacitate him. The damage you caused must have been obvious to you at the time.

'When you left he was alive and you knew that from the sound of his breathing but you didn't do anything. The fact that you attended his funeral was particular hurtful incident for his funeral and for him,' the judge said.

'People of Mr Kershaw's age should be protected and respected. He trusted you and you abused that trust in the most horrible and treacherous way,' he added.

Earlier the court was told how Mr Kershaw was renowned for being a man of smart dress and strict routine. He had lived alone since his late wife Bridget, 83, was admitted to a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

He was also well-known for carrying large wads of cash with him, and had ignored pleas to put his money in the bank.

Fearon met Mr Kershaw at the care home where Bridget was staying and became a frequent visitor to his house after agreeing to do odd jobs, the court heard.

Prosecutor Simon Medland QC said: 'When the defendant had money, he would be tempted to gamble it away.

'He had a business on the side, dealing in construction and building but he was short of money and needed to pay suppliers and work men who had been doing work for him. He was short of money and he knew that Victor Kershaw carried lots with him.

'He thought he would steal to get him out of that financial tight spot. It was obviously important to cover his tracks and disguise himself.'

Murder: Mr Kershaw, 84, had trusted Fearon with a spare set of keys to his home

The incident took place on October 4 last year, after Mr Kershaw dressed up in his jacket and trilby and boarded a bus to go to his favourite cafe before picking up his pension.

As he left Fearon was watching from his Volvo car and used the spare keys to let himself into the elderly man’s house. He put on his disguise and hid in a kitchen cupboard.

Mr Kershaw, a keen collector of binoculars and watches, also browsed the goods at a local charity shop during his outing, a court heard.

Mr Medland said staff would often see him with crumpled bank notes in his wallet and told him to put in the bank or 'someone will hit you and take it for you'.

At around 12.45pm, Mr Kershaw went a Tesco Express and shopped for groceries before a taxi picked him up and dropped him off at his home.

When he walked into the kitchen, Fearon burst out of the cupboard and hit him over the head up to six times with the mallet. Mr Kershaw’s body was discovered by police on October 14.

Tests revealed he died from severe head injuries. He suffered what was described by doctors as an 'epic fracture' to his skull as well as a fractured cheekbone and broken nose.

Mr Medland said: 'The defendant knew Mr Kershaw was dying when he left him. From the physical injuries and from the changes in his brain, it’s plain that he didn’t die quickly and must have been lying there medically alive but unable to move for possibly two days.'

Fearon was arrested on October 22 after his car had been spotted on CCTV near Mr Kershaw’s home on four separate occasions on the day of the killing.

He said later: 'It has been explained to me that intending to knock someone out has an intention to cause serious harm. But I didn’t intend to kill Mr Kershaw.'

In mitigation Mr Michael Shorrock QC said: 'If he had intended to kill he wouldn’t have taken a rubber hammer.

'He had a pathological gambling habit which was a clear factor in the build-up of this offence - he had complete inability to engage in any treatment or receive help.

'He’s never been unemployed; he was a perfectly decent man going about his business in an ordinary way. He had a great fear when he got into debt. Thinking his whole world would come crashing down. He’s genuinely sorry and remorseful.'

In a victim impact statement Mr Kershaw's stepson Anthony described the 'intolerable' suffering felt by the family.

'I'm still struggling and I'm very tearful at times,' he said in the statement.

'It was very upsetting and shocking as I saw the extent of Vincent's injuries. I almost didn't recognise him down to the blunt force.

'I wish it was a nightmare that I could wake up from. I strongly believe he [Fearon] had opportunities to change the outcome, not just before the death but after. It sickens me that he only admitted his involvement when the evidence was stacked against him.'
