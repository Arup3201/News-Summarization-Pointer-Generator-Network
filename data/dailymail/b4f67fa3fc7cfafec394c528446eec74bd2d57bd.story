German Chancellor Angela Merkel said today that allegations a German man worked as a double agent for US intelligence were serious and if true contradicted the true nature of cooperation between partners.

'If the reports are correct it would be a serious case,' Merkel said during a news conference in Beijing with Chinese Premier Li Kegiang. 'It would be for me a clear contradiction as to what I consider to be trusting cooperation between agencies and partners.'

The case risks further straining ties between the long-time allies, which have been severely tested by revelations last year of large-scale snooping on Germany by the National Security Agency, a US intelligence service.

The White House and State Department have declined to comment on the arrest of the 31-year-old employee of Germany's BND foreign intelligence agency.

The man arrested reportedly admits passing documents to a US contact.

The incident comes as a German parliamentary committee looks into allegations by former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden that Washington carried out major surveillance in the European country, including monitoring Merkel's phone.

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said during a trip to Mongolia that the spying case would have consequences if the circumstances are confirmed.

'We haven't finished clearing this up yet,' he told reporters. 'But if suspicions are confirmed that American secret services were involved, it will become a political issue and we can't just get back to business as usual.'

Surveillance is a sensitive issue in a country where memories of the Nazi's Gestapo secret police and communist East Germany's Stasi ensure the right to privacy is treasured.
