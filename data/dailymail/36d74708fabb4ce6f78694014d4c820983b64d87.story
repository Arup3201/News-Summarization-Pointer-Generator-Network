It's normally an end of year rite of passage that departing pupils get their own back on their teachers for years of homework and detentions.

But a group of teachers at a school in Devon decided to turn the tables this year and play a practical joke on Year 11 students on their final day of school instead.

Pupils at the Honiton Community College in Devon thought that they were giving tips on camera to next term's crop of new students joining the school.

But the unsuspecting teenagers were completely unaware that their teachers were lurking in the background dancing, larking around with props and waving through windows.

The first student's sensible advice warning new pupils 'not to mess around' is soon drowned out by Ricky Martin's Livin' La Vida Loca and some terrible dancing from the group of teachers.

Rob Robson, head of Year 11, said that staff thought it was about time that they had the last laugh at the end of term.

He said: 'The pupils thought they were answering questions about the best and worst things at Honiton.

'We wanted to reverse the usual student pranks. They’re a fantastic bunch with a great sense of humour.

'We didn’t think it would look that good at the end of it.

'Some of the comments have not been complimentary about our dancing, but then what do you expect teachers to dance like.

'We were making it up on the spot.'

One of the students who took part admitted that he was completely fooled by the prank until it was played back to the students.

Daryl Young said: 'A few of us had stayed up the night before, trying to decide what advice to give.

'We didn’t know what was going on behind us at first. Then the camera man started laughing, but I didn’t have a clue.

'We saw it for the first time in assembly. Everyone was really shocked. Our head of year and staff were laughing.

'I give them a lot of respect. I didn’t think the teachers had that sort of sense of humour, I didn’t know they had it in them.'

The video montage has so far attracted more than 26,000 viewings on YouTube.
