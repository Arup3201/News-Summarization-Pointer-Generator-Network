A killer who shot dead a policeman and soldier before donning a burkha in a bid to evade police was beheaded in Saudi Arabia yesterday.

Salih bin Yateem bin Salih al-Qarni was executed in the southwestern city of Abha, the official Saudi Press Agency said. 

Qarni was intially arrested on other charges and was transported in an official vehicle by the soldier and a member of the Muttawa religious police.

'He shot them with a gun that he was carrying,' the SPA said, without explaining how he obtained the weapon.

After stealing the keys from the security officer driving the vehicle, Qarni chewed some narcotic qat 'and disguised himself in women's clothing' in an attempt to flee, but was recaptured, it said.

The report did not say when the escape bid occurred.

Qarni is the latest of 69 Saudis and foreigners executed in the kingdom this year, despite international concern and condemnation for human rights groups.

Rape, murder, apostasy, drug trafficking and armed robbery are all punishable by death under the kingdom's strict version of Islamic sharia law. 

Last year, Human Rights Watch's Nisha Varia told The Observer: 'The Saudi justice system is characterised by arbitrary arrests, unfair trials and harsh punishments.'

Last week, a man who was convicted of smuggling heroin in his intestines became the seventh Pakistani beheaded for drug trafficking in Saudi Arabia in a month.

Under the Saudi Sharia legal system it can actually be harder to avert execution for crimes without a specific victim, like drug smuggling, than for murder.

Of the 59 people executed by mid-October, 22 had been convicted for smuggling drugs, according to figures compiled by Human Rights Watch from Saudi media reports. 

In Saudi Islamic law, charges of violent crimes like murder are usually brought under the system of 'qisas', which is retaliation on the principle of an eye for an eye.

While a murderer would normally be sentenced to death, the victim's family is permitted to accept 'diyya', or blood money, instead of execution. The lives of women are worth half those of men, and non-Muslims a fraction of the value of Muslims.

Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah announced plans for legal reform in 2007 but judges, have so far succeeded in putting off meaningful change

Convicts from less wealthy backgrounds, or without tribal connections, who might intercede with the family or tribe of the victim, are more likely to die because it is harder for them to arrange a blood money payment. 

One Saudi man, Mohammed Bakr al-Alaawi, was put to death for sorcery this year, the third such case since 2011. 

Although such cases are even rarer, judges can also demand execution for adulterers or Muslims who abandon their faith. 

Saudi Arabia has no civil penal code that sets out sentencing rules, and no system of judicial precedent that would make the outcome of cases predictable based on past practice.

King Abdullah announced plans for legal reform in 2007, but judges, drawn from the traditionally conservative clergy, have so far succeeded in putting off meaningful change. 

His attempts to introduce more modern training for judges and a system of precedent to make sentencing more predictable have so far been blocked by strenuous opposition from conservatives.

Even Saudis who want reform generally do not oppose the use of the death penalty by public beheading. 

Defenders of the Saudi death penalty say beheadings, usually with a single sword stroke, are at least as humane as lethal injections in the United States. 

They deplore any comparison between the kingdom's execution of convicted criminals and Islamic State's extra-judicial killing of innocent hostages.

But rights activists say they are more concerned by the justice system behind the death penalty in the kingdom than by its particular method of execution. 

And critics of the Al Saud ruling family say the latest wave of executions may have a political message, with Riyadh determined to demonstrate its toughness at a moment of regional turmoil.

Saudi Arabia beheaded 26 people in August, more than in the first seven months of the year combined.

At the time, Madawi al-Rasheed, visiting professor at the Middle East Centre of the London School of Economics, said: 'It's possible the executions were used as intimidation and flexing of muscles. It's a very volatile time and executions do serve a purpose when they're done en masse.

'There's uncertainty around Saudi Arabia from the north and from the south and inside they are taking aggressive action alongside the U.S. against Islamic State, and all that is creating some kind of upheaval, which the death penalty tries to keep a lid on.'
