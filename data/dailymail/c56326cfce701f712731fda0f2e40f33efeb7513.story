The wife of a GP who disappeared following years of depression has appealed to other men suffering from the condition to seek help.

Eight days after Gary Speed's death Shona Lidgey has told how her husband David walked out of their home in Downham Market, Norfolk, five months ago and has not been seen since.

The 45-year-old said her husband, a respected GP, left a note saying he had 'gone for a walk'.

He had battled depression for several years but Mrs Lidgey, also a doctor, said he felt unable to seek help.

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'He was wonderful at treating 
his patients who were suffering from depression, but he couldn’t treat 
himself, although he tried.'

She added: 'There should be more awareness about men suffering from depression.'

Wales manager Speed was found hanged in his garage at his Cheshire home on November 27 by his wife Louise.

There is no indication Speed was suffering from depression prior to his death. Just hours before the father-of-two had appeared on television laughing and joking.

Mrs Lidgey said her husband of 18 years had driven their three children to school on June 29 but did not come home. He left his car, wallet and mobile phone. She called the police the following morning.

The family say there have been several reported sightings of Mr Lidgey in Leicester, which is the city where he studied medicine, but his whereabouts remains a mystery. He also has links to Weymouth and Portsmouth.

Mrs Lidgey said her husband had never settled in Norfolk, where they had lived since 2008. An investigation into his computer showed he had not been in touch with anyone prior to his disappearance. 

Stephen Fry has battled bipolar disorder over the years

According to the Mental Health Foundation depression is more common in women than men. One in four women will require treatment for depression at some point in their lives compared to one in 10 men.

It is thought this is due to both social and biological factors and that fact men may have been under diagnosed because they present their GP with different symptoms.

Meanwhile, British men are three times as likely as British women to commit suicide. Suicide also remains the most common cause of death in men under 35.

Mental health charity MIND said that men manifest depression in different ways - for instance anger and violence - and are far less likely to admit there is a problem in the first place.

Mrs Lidgey said men need to feel like they can talk about their problems and it helped when people in the public eye, like Stephen Fry, raised awareness of the issues.

Fry has spoken out about his battle with manic depression and his bipolar disorder over the years.

Meanwhile, following Speed's death the PFA is planning to send out a 36-page guidebook on handling depression to all its 4,000 members.

The guidebook, which includes case studies by Andy Cole, Neil Lennon, Stan Collymore, Paul Gascoigne and PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle, is also being made available to 50,000 ex-professionals.

The PFA has also provided details of hotlines for players who believe they need help, as part of a long-term commitment to curing mental illness.
