Barack Obama has insisted he deserves another term in the White House and today revealed he's learned a lot about how to be president since he took office four years ago.

The U.S. President told NBC that he does ‘deserve a second term - but we’re not done’ and added that one of the toughest parts of the job is seeing his wife dragged into the political realm.

He will 'keep on plodding away’ and said many Americans are only frustrated with his performance because he hasn’t been able to ‘force Congress to implement every aspect of what I said in 2008’.

Exhausted: President Barack Obama, appearing in a television interview for NBC on Sunday, insisted that he does 'deserve a second term' and will continue to 'keep plodding' to get Congress to act on his ideas

President Obama was asked by NBC’s 
Today show host Matt Lauer about how he felt when Michelle Obama told 
CBS last month that she has been inaccurately portrayed as an ‘angry 
black woman’.

He said his wife is a great First 
Lady, Americans have a good impression of her and she is ready for 
another four years in the White House - despite initial reservations 
about coming to Washington.

President Obama also bemoaned his 
trouble getting Congress to act on his ideas. ‘Our founders designed a 
system that makes it more difficult to bring about change than I would 
like,’ he said.

‘What I'm going to just keep on doing 
is plodding away, very persistent. And you know what? One of the things 
about being president is you get better as time goes on,’ President 
Obama told NBC.

He admitted he still struggles as a 
father with his family being brought into politics, saying it ‘isn’t 
always very pleasant’ and ‘weighs on me’. ‘I could not be prouder of 
her,’ he said of Mrs Obama.

Mr Lauer brought up President 
Obama’s 2009 pre-Super Bowl interview, when he had said: ‘If I don’t 
have this done in three years, it’s going to be a one-term proposition.’

He responded that was in part because 
the economic recovery looked bleak in 2009, saying: ‘When you and I sat 
down (in 2009), we were losing 750,000 jobs a month. Now we’re creating 
250,000.’

President Obama added that the economy
 has added 3.7million jobs in the last 23 months, and the most 
manufacturing jobs since the early 1990s.

Much of what he said echoed his State 
of the Union address, in which he spoke of getting America back to its 
‘old-fashioned’ values of economic and social fairness.

In a turn of good news for President 
Obama, the unemployment rate fell to 8.3 per cent in January, its lowest
 since February 2009. That has been debate fodder for the GOP 
presidential candidates.

Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney 
accused the president of not including the underemployed and those who 
have stopped looking for work in his victory speech following the Nevada
 caucuses.

‘The real unemployment rate is over 15
 per cent, Mr President,’ Mr Romney said. ‘America has also had enough 
of your kind help.’

President Obama said the economic 
recovery process is lengthy and delicate. ‘The key right now is to make 
sure we don’t start turning in a new direction that could throw that 
progress off,’ he said.

Political forecasters agree the newest
 unemployment figure gives a much-needed boost to President Obama’s 
chances of winning a second term, but he knows he is in for a fight this
 autumn.

'There's going to be just a lot of money floating around... and I guarantee you a bunch of that's going to be negative. But it's not going to be enough just to say the other guy's a bum'

‘There's going to be just a lot of 
money floating around...and I guarantee you a bunch of that's going to 
be negative,’ he told NBC. ‘But it's not going to be enough just to say 
the other guy's a bum.’

According to one editorial in the 
National Journal, GOP presidential hopefuls may soon have to pick on 
rising gas prices rather than unemployment, as numbers continue to 
remain cautiously positive.

In the interview, which aired in two 
parts last night and this morning, the President and Mr Lauer also 
discussed the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, and the 
United States’ role.

He did not answer directly if he would
 support Israel should they decide to strike out at Iran, but said that 
he has good intelligence abroad and wants to resolve the nuclear issue 
diplomatically.
