The Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers paid tribute to Canada before their game last night as the entire arena stood to sing the country's national anthem, O Canada.

The special performance of the Canadian national anthem was to show solidarity with the people of Ottawa following the tragic events that unfolded in Canada's capital city earlier in the day.

Since the game in Pittsburgh did not involve a Canadian team, there was no requirement for the Penguins to do this, but it was still a touching and heartfelt gesture on their part.

Penguins performer Jeff Jimerson sang the anthem while the lyrics were displayed to allow the crowd to sing along.

'Ladies and gentlemen, tonight our thoughts and prayers are with our friends in Ottawa and across Canada. Please join us in the singing of 'O Canada,' the announcement said. 

‘O Canada’ is typically only sung if a Canadian team is playing, but fans inside the Consol Energy Center joined together as two maple leaves were projected onto the ice. 

Nathan Cirillo, while guarding Ottawa's War Memorial, was killed by a shooter who, along with at least one believed counterpart, went on to fire shots in the Canadian Parliamentary building.

The incidents left the Canadian capital on lockdown, canceled a scheduled Sens-Leafs game and deeply affected the country overall.

The Penguins and Flyers' rosters are filled with Canadians, including Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby and goalie Marc-Andre Fleury.

During the game, the Penguins tweeted from their official Twitter account, saying, 'Some things are bigger than hockey. Tonight Pens fans sang along with with Canadian anthem.'
