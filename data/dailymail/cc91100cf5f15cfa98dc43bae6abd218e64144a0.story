Five rail bosses are set to receive £11million over three years in an extraordinary deal that critics condemned as rewarding failure.

The top executives at Network Rail could share bonuses of £5million on top of their six-figure salaries, despite years of dismal performance and inflation-busting fare rises.

The deal was nodded through yesterday. The taxpayer-funded firm is currently facing a £75million fine for missing its punctuality targets for long distance services.

Network Rail, a not-for-profit company, has also been dogged by constant complaints over crowded trains and fare rises.

Its five bosses were already earning salaries of between £348,000 and £577,000 a year, with annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income. 

But yesterday a new ‘long-term incentive’ payment was agreed. This additional bonus will be paid at the end of three years and is worth a maximum of a full year’s salary, depending on performance.

The new element was rubber-stamped at  the company’s annual general meeting in Cardiff. 

Over three years chief executive David Higgins could earn £3.1million, made up of his basic salary of £577,000, a long-term bonus worth the same again and potential annual bonuses worth £790,490 over three years.

The other four directors will earn between £1.8million and £2.1million over the three-year period if they hit performance targets.

Before the vote Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association(TSSA), had written to members – the company’s equivalent to shareholders – urging them to reject the bonus plan. 

Afterwards, Mr Cortes said the union was ‘bitterly disappointed’ by the plan.

‘Once again public members of Network Rail have put the interests of bosses ahead of passengers,’ he said.

‘These bosses will be on board a very lucrative gravy train while the poor passengers pay through the nose with annual above-inflation fare rises.’

It was voted on by Network Rail’s 44 ‘members’. Their job is to hold the board to account.

Bonuses: The Director of Operations Robin Gisby (left) and strategy director Paul Plummer (right) earn £371,000 and £348,000. Their annual bonuses are worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income

Condemned: Critics say bosses like Simon Kirby (pictured) should not be given the bonuses when they have missed targets and customers are paying more for tickets

But as a company limited by guarantee, its members do not have any financial interest in the company, which is supposed to put its profits back into maintaining the railways.

Chief executive of Passenger Focus, Anthony Smith, said: ‘Passengers will wonder why bonuses are being paid if the service is getting worse. 

‘We support incentives for improved services, but bonuses should be tied to passenger satisfaction, not be rewards for failure.’ 

Labour’s transport spokesman, Maria Eagle, also condemned the move.

She said: ‘Commuters facing inflation-busting fare rises will be outraged at the scale of the bonus packages being enjoyed by a few at the top of the rail industry.

‘With passengers facing overcrowded services and too many delayed and cancelled trains, it is wrong for Network Rail to be paying out such large sums to its senior managers.

‘It will particularly anger passengers that these bonuses are being paid for a year when Network Rail has failed to meet its own performance target on train punctuality.’ 

She added that ministers should ‘make it clear that bonuses on this scale are simply not appropriate in a company that receives nearly £4billion of taxpayers’ money every year’.

Network Rail has defended the long-term bonus, saying it is intended ‘to recognise outstanding and exceptional performance over the three years to 2015’. 

It said any future awards would be measured against train performance, savings made for the taxpayer and the successful delivery of congestion easing projects, each of which has ‘tough’ targets. Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones, who does not receive any bonuses, said: ‘Network Rail executives are rewarded only when exceptional performance exceeds tough targets, which have been approved by our members through an open and transparent process. 

‘If targets are not met, or safety comprised, no bonuses are made.’ 

He insisted the firm had made exceptional progress over the past 12 months, with passenger numbers rising to 1.5billion.

The annual bonuses scheme already pays bosses up to 60 per cent of their salary provided they meet targets on punctuality as well as train company and passenger satisfaction.

Controversial: Network Rail members have approved a fresh lucrative bonus package for its top directors - despite fierce criticism from unions about the firm's performance

But those targets were missed last year, so executives received just 17 per cent rather than the maximum 60 per cent of salary.

A spokesman for the Office of Rail Regulation said: ‘Network Rail has a licence requiring it to have a remuneration and bonus scheme to ensure that it encourages high standards of performance. 

‘The company is responsible for delivering key UK infrastructure and large investment projects which are of huge value to rail users, taxpayers and the economy. It is vitally important that it is able to secure the right talent and leadership.’

The £40billion high-speed rail line should be ditched because hologram technology will supercede it, Ed Miliband’s new business guru said yesterday.

Lord Mitchell said the HS2 line linking London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds would be made redundant within 20 years.

Holograms uses lasers to create lifelike images in the air. Lord Mitchell suggested businessmen would be able to beam images of themselves to meetings, removing the need for travel.
