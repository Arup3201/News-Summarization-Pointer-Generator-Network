Tragedy: Nastasha Noland, 25, fell out of the door while fighting with another woman and was run over by the bus

A drunken female reveller who fell out of a party bus during a catfight was caught under the wheels of the bus and killed.

The two young women clashed on their way back from a country music concert to Santa Cruz, California, when the doors accidentally opened and the tragic accident took place.

Natasha Noland, 25, died after plunging from the bus at around 11.50pm on Friday on Highway 17, while a 20-year-old woman from Felton was injured.

Several of the 12 to 15 passengers on the Party Bus of Santa Cruz fled the scene, according to Mercury News, and two others were arrested for drunkenness.

The group was returning from a Brad Paisley concert at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View and were all 'highly intoxicated' and uncooperative, according to police.

'We're hoping once they sober up they'll cooperate a bit more,' said California Highway Patrol officer DJ Sarabia.

The shocking news comes at a time when lawmakers are debating whether to more closely regulate drinking on party buses.

Party buses are typically vans that look
like airport shuttles and can seat from 15 to 30 people. They 
often have couches and bars instead of row seating and some include 
stripper poles and dance floors.

'As they're fighting, somehow the door to this bus opens up and they both fall out,' said Mr Sarabia. 'The victim is run over by the bus, and the other woman is injured.'

Ms Noland is the daughter of Todd and Sue, owners of a well-known Santa Cruz surf shop.

Employees at Pacific Wave, where she worked as the women's goods buyer, later said they were devastated by the news.

Ms Noland was a 'super fun person' who was 
friendly and generous, said assistant manager Jessica Eshom, 25. She 
loved country music and was known for being fashionable, Ms Eshom said.

'She had a good heart, a good soul,' said Ms Eshom. 'She was an all-around amazing person. It's unbelievable what happened.'

Her 20-year-old rival was taken to hospital and treated for moderate injuries, police said.

Officers shut down Highway 17 between Lark Avenue and state Highway 9 to conduct an investigation and reopened it to traffic at 3.30am.

The driver of the bus, an unnamed woman has not been charged and that the incident remains under investigation. A person who answered a phone call to Party Bus on Saturday declined to comment.

Another friend of Ms Noland, Natalia Lockwood, 22, said: 'She was always happy and doing fun things and hanging out with friends.'

The bill seeking to clamp down on party buses would require party bus drivers to check the IDs of passengers. If any passengers are under the legal drinking age, alcoholic beverages would be prohibited unless a designated chaperone aged 25 or older is on board. The bill is expected to go before the state Senate in August.

Had it been law already, 'it could have prevented what happened last night,' said assemblyman Jerry Hill, noting that the woman who was fighting Ms Noland was only 20.

He sponsored the bill after 19-year-old Burlingame resident Brett Studebaker was killed in another party bus-related accident in 2010.

Mr Studebaker died in a car crash on Highway 101 in San Mateo after he got behind the wheel following three hours drinking on a party bus. At the time of his accident, his blood alcohol level was 0.26, more than three times the legal limit. A passenger in his car suffered brain damage and broken bones.

Doug Studebaker, the teenager's father, said he was saddened by the news of Ms Noland's death and that it points to the need for regulation of the party bus industry.

'A lot of parents and people don't know the extent of the drinking that occurs and is actually encouraged on these party buses,' said Mr Studebaker. 'There are certain vendors that are very unethical and allow underage drinking - in fact make a business of it.'

Mr Hill added that part of the inspiration for his bill was a call he received from a San Carlos mother after her 15-year-old daughter emerged so drunk from a ride to San Francisco aboard a party bus that she had to be taken to the hospital.

Minors drinking on party buses 'happens a lot more than we know of,' Mr Hill said.

Witness Roberta 
Dallimonti said on Sunday: 'I ran to the middle of the road. It was
pitch black and no other cars were around. It was just so crazy. It was awful.'

The Dallimontis said they witnessed Noland's distraught boyfriend getting forced to sit in a police car. They said he was angry and punched out a police car window.

No one has been charged, and the accident remains under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.
