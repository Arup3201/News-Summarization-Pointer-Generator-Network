Freezing cold and exhausted after running 42km in sub zero temperatures an Australian man summoned up the energy to propose to his girlfriend at the North Pole - and she said yes.

A video captures the emotional moment when plucky James Alderson goes down on one knee to pop the question to his girlfriend Demelza Farr moments after the pair had crossed the finish line of the North Pole 2012 marathon.

Breathing heavily after completing the gruelling snow-covered course in just over six hours Mr Alderson takes his partner's hand and asks 'will you marry me?'

Physically drained from the rigors of the race a visibly shocked Ms Farr covers her mouth in surprise as she breaks down in tears saying 'Oh my God, I can't believe it.'

Mr Alderson nervously tells her that he has 'got the ring and everything' before repeating the important question one more time.

After taking a few seconds to compose herself Ms Farr finally says yes and the couple embrace to celebrate their union at the top of the World.

An elated Mr Alderson turns to the camera and pumps his fist in celebration and referring to himself, says: 'He nailed it, he nailed it.'

It was a double celebration for Ms Farr who moments before had become the first woman home in the intense marathon, battling through -26C temperatures to clock a time of six hours and six minutes.

After she had had time to let the news sink in Ms Farr wrote on her Facebook page: 'Had a life-changing experience at the North Pole.

'Not only was the scenery incredible, but I slogged myself over the line as the first female finisher...and then got engaged.'

Mr Alderson finished the race eighth among the men.
