Three men who made deadly ‘Arctic Ice’  fake vodka with liquid used in antifreeze and cleaning fluids were sentenced today - but two of them avoided jail.

Their illegal alcohol manufacturing and bottling plant, was appropriately located on Brewery Street in the city centre of Birmingham, West Midlands.

It was uncovered by HM Revenue and Customs officers following a raid on an industrial unit in July 2011.

Forensic analysis of the fake vodka showed it contained dangerous levels of methanol - which if drunk can cause abdominal pain, dizziness, blindness, kidney problems, comas or even death.

Alex Dean Rollason, 21, was spared jail and given 200 hours of unpaid work

Investigators seized more than 2,500 litres of counterfeit vodka labelled ‘Arctic Ice’ and 13 1,000-litre plastic industrial bulk containers - three of which contained industrial alcohol of 96 per cent.

Michael Woodlock, 53, was today jailed for one year. Gavin Berrow, 43, was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

Alex Dean Rollason, 21, was jailed for four months, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. The three men were sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court.

Adrian Farley, HMRC’s  assistant director of criminal 
investigations, said 8,400 empty 70cl glass bottles 
were also seized.

He added: ‘This was a substantial bottling, production
and distribution plant.

‘It
was capable of making and distributing large quantities of counterfeit 
vodka throughout the country, with the potential of costing the UK 
taxpayer nearly £500,000 in lost revenue.’

‘The crime gang took no precautions to
make the environment safe creating a high risk of an explosion and loss
of life in their city centre unit.

‘They were fully aware that the counterfeit vodka, which contained dangerous levels of methanol, was unfit to drink.

'They
duped the public into buying what they believed were legitimate goods 
when in fact the counterfeit vodka could have killed them.’

All three men are from the West 
Midlands and pleaded guilty to charges of Fraudulent Evasion of Excise 
Duty Contrary to the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.

Joint investigations with local 
authorities across the West Midlands led to the discovery that Arctic 
Ice was already in circulation at a number of independent stores.

Seizures
were made in Birmingham, Hereford, Shropshire, Staffordshire and 
Worcester by Trading Standards units - some of which are pursuing 
separate prosecutions.

The 
raid took place six days after five Lithuanian men were killed in an 
explosion at an illicit vodka distillery in Boston, Lincolnshire, 
believed to have been caused by the lighting of a cigarette.
