 A Florida woman is accused of using a stun gun on her three-year-old nephew. But the woman and her family are denying the charges and claiming  the incident was a misunderstanding.

Ramona Braswell, 30, of St Petersburg, Florida was arrested and charged with felony child abuse Saturday after police responded to a 911 call from her sister, Karen Braswell, saying Ramona had used a Taser on her son, according to CBS Tampa Bay. 

The boy's mother told police that she heard her son crying from another room and found her sister laughing and activating the stun gun near him. 

Stun Gun: Ramona Braswell, 30, of St. Pete, was arrested and charged with felony child abuse Saturday for allegedly using a stun gun on her three-year-old nephew 

Laughing: Braswell was reportedly laughing and activating the stun gun near the three-year-old in the living room of her home when the boy's mother entered the room after hearing her son begin to cry

Authorities say the boy told his mother that Braswell used the device on his arm. Officers say the three-year-old had marks on his arm consistent with those caused by a stun gun.

Braswell told authorities that the stun gun belonged to a friend and denied using it on the boy but did admit to placing the stun gun's handle on the boy's arm; she said she was 'just playing' with the device, WFLA reports. 

Braswell has been released from jail on $5,000 bail.  

Initially, the boy told police that Braswell used the stun gun on him and his mother claimed the same. But now, both have changed their stories. 

Stories: The three-year-old and his mother initially claimed that Braswell used the stun gun on him, but have since changed their stories and claim the situation was a 'misunderstanding'

Facebook: Braswell has repeatedly claimed that she did not use the stun gun on her nephew and has even taken to Facebook to claim her innocence 

The boy's mother said that her son was just scared and confused and insists that Braswell did not harm him, according to WTSP.

In her initial 911 call, Braswell's sister spoke through tears as she told the dispatcher what she believed happened to her son, she repeatedly told the dispatcher that she didn't want anyone to get in trouble. 

'I don't want nothing to happen to [Braswell], I'm not going to have nowhere to stay,' the boy's mother said. 'I called you guys because [Braswell] said we 'don't have any proof.' 

Marks: Authorities say that the boy had marks on his arm consistent with those that would be made by a stun gun (above is the stun gun Braswell was accused of using to harm the boy)

Braswell told WTSP that she loves her nephew and said 'everybody knows that I would never hurt a child.' She admitted that playing with the stun gun around the three-year-old was a 'mistake' but said she would never touch a child with it.  

Braswell even took to Facebook and, in a post, wrote that she is 'not crying' because she did nothing wrong.
