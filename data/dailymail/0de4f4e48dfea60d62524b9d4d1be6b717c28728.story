Arsenal's stuttering domestic form didn't appear to faze the squad as they travelled via Eurostar to Belgium ahead of their Champions League group match against Anderlecht on Wednesday.

The Gunners were all smiles as they boarded the train on Tuesday as they look to record their second Champions League victory of the season.

The squad were in a relaxed mood as England quartet Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers can all be seen sharing a table in first class while enjoying their electronic devices.

Club captain Arteta travelled with the squad as he steps up his recovery from a calf injury

Spain trio Mikel Arteta, Santi Cazorla, and Nacho Monreal all sat together - with the latter two hoping to keep their places in Arsene Wenger's starting XI after being selected for their Premier League 2-2 draw against Hull on Saturday.

Arsenal go into their Champions League clash with Anderlecht facing a goalkeeping crisis with untested Emiliano Martinez set to be thrown in at the deep end.

The Gunners are without first choice keeper Wojciech Szczesny due to suspension following his red card against Galatasaray and second choice David Ospina is out with a thigh injury.

Third-choice Martinez, who sat next to summer signing Alexis Sanchez on the Eurostar, trained with the rest of his team-mates ahead of the trip to Belgium alongside three other untried keepers.

The 22-year-old has only played twice for the club - with his last appearance for the north London outfit coming two years ago

Argentine Martinez, 22, is a product of Arsenal's youth system. He has played just twice for the club in the past with his last appearance coming in the kamikaze 7-5 Capital One Cup win over Reading two years ago.

Martinez spent a period on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last year.

He played 15 times for the Owls but the Champions League tie in Anderlecht will be the biggest match he has been involved in since his arrival in England.

So far in the Champions League Arsenal have beaten Galatasaray but lost to Borussia Dortmund and have three points from a possible six.

VIDEO Arsenal not reaching potential - Wenger

There was some good news for Wenger as Aaron Ramsey trained with the squad as he prepares to make his first start in a month.

The Welsh international came off the bench during the draw with Hull at the weekend and is in line to start on Wednesday night.

There was further good news for Arsenal as Theo Walcott trained with the first team as he steps up his return from nine months out after rupturing knee ligaments against Tottenham Hotspur in January.

He played 45 minutes for the reserves on Friday night, but is not expected to feature against Anderlecht.
