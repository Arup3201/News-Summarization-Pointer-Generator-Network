The Indian woman who was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi earlier this month has suffered 'significant' brain injury and is fighting for her life, doctors have said. 

The 23-year-old woman was flown to Singapore for treatment at Mount Elizabeth hospital on Thursday, 10 days after she was brutally attacked by six men on Dec. 16.

Hospital chief executive Dr. Kelvin Loh said Friday she also has infection of the lungs and abdomen. He said she 'is currently struggling against the odds.'

He says a multi-disciplinary team of specialists is working tirelessly to save her life.

The rape has triggered widespread outrage and calls for ensuring the safety of women who are subject to sexual harassment ranging from groping to rape every day across India.

It came as the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh responded to days of violent protest at the attack by promising better action to protect the nation's women.

He said: 'The issue of safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government.'

Brutal attack: The 23-year-old student was assaulted on a moving bus and has now died from her injuries

The young victim was transferred to a hospital in Singapore but unfortunately doctors reported she died 'peacefully'

A hospital statement said she was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Mount Elizabeth hospital and she was in an 'extremely critical condition'. 

India's Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said in a statement that the government, which is funding and overseeing the victim's treatment, had decided to send her abroad on the recommendation of her doctors.

'Despite the best efforts of our doctors, the victim continues to be critical and her fluctuating health remains a big cause of concern to all of us,' he said.

Meanwhile, authorities in India are attempting to stem any further violence from demonstrations that erupted in reaction to the rape.

Police have barricaded streets, blocked metro stations and increased their presence in the city centre of New Delhi.

One police officer has been killed during the protests. A 47-year-old married father of three died after three days' treatment in hospital, according to news service Al Jazeera

Concern: Members of the top organ transplant medical team accompanied the gang rape victim to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore

State of the art: transplant facilities at the Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre in Singapore, where the gang-rape victim underwent treatment, are said to be among the best in the world

He was found on the ground during the protests. Eight people have been arrested and charged in connection with his death.

His relatives, speaking on Al Jazeera, blame 'the people' for his death.

'It
 is the fault of the people. He was only doing his duty and following 
police orders. But the public attacked him and killed him so the people 
are responsible,' one relative said.

Police
 said an autopsy showed the officer had a heart attack that could have 
been caused by injuries suffered during violence at the protest.

An
 Associated Press journalist at the scene said the officer was running 
toward the protesters with a group of police when he collapsed on the 
ground and began frothing at the mouth and shaking. The journalist said 
two protesters rushed to the officer to try to help him.

Peaceful: Protestors want the government to take action to improve safety for women in India

As news of the horrific assault reached the public in India, outraged and disgusted civilians took to the streets in protest.

Across
 the country there have been demonstrations, including candle-lit vigils
 and street protests with placards, chants and road blocks.

During the days of protests, reports reveal more than 100 people and about 70 officers have been hurt.

Police
 have used batons, teargas and water cannon to try and disperse the 
demonstrators after the authorities attempted to limit the public 
gatherings.

The Government 
has faced criticism for the use of force against protesters, the failure
 to implement laws to protect women in India's 'rape capital' and for 
how slow it has been to respond to the strength of feeling.

New Delhi: Activists of the All-India Democratic Women's Association and YWCA students take part in a protest march from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India gate against the gangrape of a girl, in New Delhi

Clashes: Police have been criticised for using heavy handed tactics against demonstrators who are demanding better protection of women following the brutal bus gang rape

But it looks like there is no end in sight for the demonstrations, however, as another march took place today in the city.

Those taking part were demanding a government crackdown on the daily harassment Indian women face, ranging from groping to severe violence.

Protesters demanding safer public transportation for women and the resignation of Delhi's police commissioner tried to march to the major India Gate traffic circle in central Delhi before being stopped by police in riot gear manning barricades.

Protesters carried signs reading, 'Immediately end rape culture in India' and 'Zero tolerance of violence against women'.

Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack.

Some protesters have called for the death penalty or castration for rapists, who under current laws face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged today to take action to protect the nation's women.

Singh's government set up two committees in response to the protests. One, looking into speeding up sexual assault trials, has already received 6,100 email suggestions. The second will examine what lapses might have contributed to the rape - which took place on a moving bus that passed through police checkpoints - and suggest measures to improve women's safety.

'Let me state categorically that the issue of safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government,' Singh said at a development meeting. He urged officials in India's states to pay special attention to the problem.

'There can be no meaningful development without the active participation of half the population, and this participation simply cannot take place if their security and safety is not assured,' he said.

Singh previously came under fire for 
remaining largely silent after the rape. He issued a statement for the 
first time on Sunday - a week after the crime.

The
 horrific sexual assault, which took place on a bus on December 16, in 
New Delhi, lasted 40 minutes, according to the Gulfnews.com, which 
states the men involved allegedly tricked the woman to board the bus.

During
 the brutal assault, the victim was attacked with an iron rod, leaving 
her with serious injuries and in a critical condition.

Police said the rape victim was traveling on the evening of Dec 16 with a male friend on the bus.

B.D.
 Athani, the medical superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi,
 where the woman had been treated, said she suffered severe intestinal 
and abdominal injuries, underwent three surgeries and had parts of her 
intestines removed, according to the Press Trust of India. 

'With
 fortitude and courage, the girl survived the after-effects of the 
injuries so far well. But the condition continues to be critical,' he 
was quoted as saying.

Six suspects have been arrested in connection with the attack and have been remanded in custody.
