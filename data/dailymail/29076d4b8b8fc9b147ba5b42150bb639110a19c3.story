A coroner attacked the cosmetics industry yesterday for ‘grossly underestimating’ problems caused by a hair dye chemical.

Geoff Fell called for action after an inquest heard how Julie McCabe, 39, collapsed and died from an extreme allergic reaction to the L’Oreal colour she used every month.

It was only the third known death in the world and the second in the UK caused by the chemical para-phenylenediamine (PPD). But Mr Fell told the hearing that inadequate reporting meant the industry was hopelessly unaware of the scale of non-fatal allergic reactions.

After the hearing, Mrs McCabe’s widower Russell said the tragedy may have been prevented if labels had clearer warnings of severe reactions. Her family is now hoping to sue L’Oreal.

The coroner also warned parents not to let children have popular black henna tattoos on holiday due to their dangerously high concentrations of PPD.

The skin decorations by ‘artisan tattooists on the beach’ were ‘extremely dangerous’, he said. ‘These people need to be avoided like the plague - in fact, they are the plague,’ warned Mr Fell. 

Estate agent Mrs McCabe, 38, went into a coma in October 2011 after she suffered a massive allergic reaction to a chemical in her L'Oreal dye. She had a heart attack and died a year later.

The inquest into her death heard that she had a black henna tattoo in Dubai in 2007 and her regular reactions to hair dye had increased after this.

Expert evidence said the tattoos contained massive amounts of PPD - the chemical in the hair dye which is thought to have caused her reaction - and that the tattoos increased susceptibility.

Returning an accidental death verdict, Mr Fell said he would be writing to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills to ask it to look into increasing public awareness of this danger.

He said: 'People think it's a good idea to let their children have a black henna tattoo.

'That child could go through life 10, 15, 30 years and the first time that child dyes its hair there could be an anaphylactic reaction.'

Colouring products contain a variety of chemicals but PPD is the prime cause of allergic reaction to hair dye.

It is needed for most shades of permanent colour, especially dark shades.

There is a strict limit on the concentration of PPD at a maximum of 2 per cent in any substance applied to the hair. The dye used by Julie McCabe had a 1 per cent strength.

There must also be clear warnings and usage instructions on all packaging.

PPD is often used illegally in black henna tattoos offered at tourist spots. The inquest heard Mrs McCabe had a reaction from such a tattoo on holiday in Dubai in 2007.

Mr Fell also called on the cosmetics industry to do more to find out how many customers have adverse reactions to their hair dyes, saying it had 'grossly under-estimated' the scale of the issue.

PPDs are know to cause allergic reactions in a small number of cases but the industry had not found a replacement, the inquest in Skipton, North Yorkshire, heard.

The coroner said there was a massive gap between industry figures, which suggest four customers in a million suffered such a reaction, and academic research which suggests it was as many as 14 per cent.

Mr Fell said L'Oreal did not encourage customers to report such problems to it and urged the company to reconsider this position, and the industry as a whole to proactively commission more research.

The coroner decided that Mrs McCabe, of Cowling, near Keighley, was aware of her allergy to the hair dye as she had gone to her GP at least 16 times to get treatment for much less severe reactions.

But he said he was aware of only one other death in the UK due to an anaphylactic reaction to hair dye.

North Yorkshire Coroner Geoff Fell warned that the cosmetics industry has 'no idea' of the extent to which customers are allergic to hair dye after the tragic death of Jule McCabe.

Mr Fell said the number of people allergic to hair colourant had been 'grossly underestimated' and there was a 'massive disconnect' between allergy figures quoted by cosmetics firms and those found in academic research.

One  study revealed 140,000 people suffered a reaction to hair dye for every million with half of those reporting problems continuing to use the dye. The industry said it was four in a million.  

'Nobody has any idea how many customers are adversely affected by hair dye,' he warned.

'The industry is aware of the risk of anaphylaxis but the industry, it seems to me, has no idea of the incidents of non-fatal anaphylaxis due to hair dye.'

The coroner now urged the industry to do more to encourage customers to report adverse reactions and to research the problem.

'L'Oreal do not actively seek feedback,' he added. 'I think L'Oreal need to revisit that approach.' 

Mr Fell said he would also be writing to the Department of Business Innovation and Skills to ask for more public awareness about black henna tattoos- which contain massive amounts of paraphenylenediamine- thought to increase susceptibility to reactions to hair dye. 

The three-day inquest heard how Mrs McCabe was a regular user of the L'Oreal Recital Preference product and between 2005 and 2011 she visited the doctors up to 20 times to report rashes, itches and other problems.

One of her GPs told the hearing there was no record she had been told stop using the product but it was 'inconceivable' this advice would not have been given.

Doctors do not have to report allergic reactions to hair dye as it is not a substance they prescribe, the inquest heard. Last year £327million of hair colour products were sold in the UK with ten million people colouring their hair every four to eight weeks. 

Mrs McCabe's husband Russell said in a statement to the inquest that he heard his wife scream and then say to him: 'I'm struggling to breathe, I think I'm going to die,' before lapsing into her coma in October 2011.

After the inquest, Mr McCabe said: 'Julie was a wonderful wife and fantastic mother to our two children. We miss her every single day and her loss has torn our family apart.

'To lose any loved one is devastating enough but to lose someone in these circumstances at such a young age has been too much to bear. We will never recover from this loss.

'But we hope that some good can come of this tragedy and that people are now more aware of the potential dangers of these sorts of products. Had there been clearer warnings about the severe reactions on the labels it may have prevented this from ever happening.'

Carol Hopwood, of the law firm Slater and Gordon, representing the family, said: 'Mrs McCabe could never have expected that a routine part of her beauty regime would have such devastating consequences.

'This tragedy highlights how common products contain potentially lethal chemicals and illustrates how important it is that clear warnings are placed on packaging to alert customers of the risk of serious injury or even death from the use of these products.

'It is also vital that doctors are fully aware of the warning signs, what advice they should give patients and when patient should be referred to hospital.

'I would urge anyone who is using products like this and have had any adverse reactions to stop using them immediately and to speak to their doctor.'

A L'Oreal spokeswoman said: 'Our thoughts are with Julie McCabe's family. We welcome the coroner's recommendations and will work with the CTPA (Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association) and rest of industry to look at ways to improve gathering of information.

'We fully support his decision to send a report to BIS (Department of Business, Innovation and Skills) highlighting his, and the industry's, concerns about black henna tattoos. We will support increased industry efforts to build awareness of the allergy risk black henna tattoos can cause.

'Sadly, this tragic accident highlights how important it is to follow safety instructions.

'We strongly recommend consumers read and follow safety and usage instructions clearly printed on our packs and notices. 

'As stated on our pack, it is extremely important to do an allergy alert test at least 48 hours before use, each time the hair is coloured. If you have ever experienced any reaction after colouring your hair or any reaction after temporary tattooing with black henna, you should not proceed.'
