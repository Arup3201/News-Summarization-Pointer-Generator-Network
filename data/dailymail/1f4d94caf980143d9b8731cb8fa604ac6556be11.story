Maurice Leese, 65, from Staffordshire, attempted to fight off the armed robber who stabbed him in the face

A brave businessman was stabbed eight times in the face by a
robber as he fought to protect his shop in a terrifying daylight raid.

Brave Maurice Leese, 65, was working alone at his cash-for-gold shop when the robber burst in armed with a large kitchen knife and slammed him to the floor.

The pair grappled together for a number of minutes, during which the intruder repeatedly stabbed the defenceless pensioner who tried to push him off.

Mr Leese, who used his hands and arms to shield his face, gave up when he feared he would loose an eye.

The hooded robber stole £300
from the till before fleeing.

But despite the horrifying ordeal, Mr
Leese, has refused to let fear stop him from working and today 
returned to his business in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire - just two days after the 
frenzied
attack.

The former borough councillor was rushed to University
Hospital of North Staffordshire where he was treated for puncture wounds to his
face and cuts to his arms and hands.

Mr Leese, of Talke, Staffordshire, said: ‘I was on my own in
the shop. I saw him running past the window, but didn’t realise the
significance of it.

‘He ran into the shop and slammed into me. I was sitting on
a swivel chair with wheels on it and fell over sideways.

‘We had a fight which must have lasted about two minutes,
but it felt like a life-time. He had a great big kitchen knife.

'He was stabbing me in the face trying to get me to tell him
where the money was.

‘It became obvious that if I didn’t I was going to lose my
eye.

Despite the ordeal, Mr Leese has returned to work at his cash for gold shop, The Gold Post, today

‘He probably stabbed me six to eight times in the face,
another three times in my right hand and I’ve got a cut on my left hand.

‘It is dangerous dealing in gold, but you can’t go through
life worrying.’

His shop, The Gold Post, was cordoned off on
Saturday as forensic officers combed the area for clues.

Police are trawling through CCTV footage from nearby shops,
in the hope it may have captured the robber who fled from the scene.

Trader Nico Nicolau 32, who owns the Hartshill Chippy
opposite the gold shop, said: ‘Maurice is a very nice gentleman and no-one
deserves to be attacked.

‘There would be concerns with that type of business and with
the economy as it is.

‘Maurice is always sitting on his own in the shop. He works
for a living and he gets this type of treatment, it is just wrong.

‘You never expect it to happen in the middle of the day like
that.”

Inspector Steven Wilde, of Staffordshire Police, said: ‘At
about 4pm a robbery occurred at the Gold Post while the proprietor was at the
premises.

‘A man armed with a knife entered and made threats demanding
money.

‘A struggle ensued between the two during which the
proprietor sustained facial injuries and has since been treated at hospital.

‘The man made off with a quantity of cash. We are now
appealing for witnesses.’

The attacker, armed with a kitchen, ran away with £300 from the till
