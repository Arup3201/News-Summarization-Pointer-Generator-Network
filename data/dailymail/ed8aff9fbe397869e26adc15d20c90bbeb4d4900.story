Props from what is believed to be from the new set of the Star Wars film have been spotted in the Abu Dhabi desert.

The pictures show a giant gray disc, which looks similar to the escape pod used by C3PO and R2D2 in the original 1977 film, being rolled around a desert encampment.

Filming for the seventh episode, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, in the beloved franchise had been scheduled to begin in spring.

Rumors: The sight of a large gray disc in the Abu Dhabi desert has excited Star Wars fans

On location: A flurry of activity in the desert has led many to believe filming has started on the seventh Star Wars

The dune location had led to speculation that the film set near Qasr Al Sarab resort is Tatooine, the setting for the 1977 Star Wars: A New Hope film, and home to Luke Skywalker.

Sources told the National that crew members have been hired for the secretive part of filming taking place in Abu Dhabi.

Little is known about what will be the seventh installment in the franchise, other than it will take place 35 years after Return of the Jedi and will include the offspring of the original cast.

It is strongly anticipated that Abrams, who is working with a $200 million budget, will bring back Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill to resume their original roles.

A replica of Han Solo's Millennium Falcon is also believed to have already been built at Pinewood Studios in London.

Bringing back the stars of the original trilogy could be a way to win favor with diehard fans. And, while it will be the first of the films not written or directed by George Lucas, JJ Abrams has been given exclusive access to his notes for a planned sequel.

Paul Ens, who worked for Lucasfilm for several years, told the Guardian that the director and scriptwriters had been allowed to see Lucas's notes for episodes VII, VIII and IX.

'George had notes hidden in a safe 
somewhere for 20 years about his plans for the nine films, none of which
 anyone was privy to,' Mr Ens said.

'The thing that excites me most is that 
JJ Abrams and his team had access to those full notes and had the 
opportunity to do some question and answer sessions with George about 
them, while also not being beholden to them.

'As a Star Wars fan, the 
thought that the world may never have seen those pages would have been 
very sad,' he added.

If the props and desert camp spotted in Abu Dhabi are part of the movie, it would be the first time scenes set on the fictional planet Tatooine have been filmed outside of Tunisia.

The film is due to be released on December 18, 2015.
