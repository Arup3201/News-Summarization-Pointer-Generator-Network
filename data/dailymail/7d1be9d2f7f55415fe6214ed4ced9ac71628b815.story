Settlement: Manwin, owned by Fabian Thylmann (above), alleged that ICM Registry had engaged in price-gouging over its sales of .xxx domain names

The owner of one of the largest 
portfolios of adult-oriented websites has agreed to settle an antitrust 
lawsuit it brought against the company that has exclusive authority over
 sales of .xxx domain names.

Manwin
 Licensing International SARL, which owns sites such as YouPorn.com and 
xTube.com, jointly announced with ICM Registry that they 
had agreed to settle the lawsuit that Manwin filed in Los Angeles 
federal court in November 2011.

Based
 in Luxembourg, Manwin also had sued the Internet Corporation for 
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which approved ICM's application to 
become the exclusive registry of .xxx sites.

Jeffrey LeVee of Jones Day, an attorney for ICANN, said that it had 
reached a confidential settlement with Manwin to end the case.

Manwin, run by 'King of Porn' Fabian Thylmann, sued over what it said were overly high prices for .xxx names.

The
 agreement between ICM and Manwin, according to the companies, will 
result in discounted wholesale prices of $7.85 a year for .xxx names 
during May.

ICM, which is owned by British former fax-machine mogul Stuart Lawley, promised to offer similar promotions in the future.

The deal also calls for Manwin to allow content from, or advertising for, other .xxx websites on some of its sites.

'Both
 parties feel that these arrangements will set precedent for trade and 
consumer benefit and protection for the online space,' the companies 
said in their statement.

The introduction of .xxx was supposed to help Internet users easily identify the content they are seeking.

In
 its lawsuit, Manwin alleged that ICM had engaged in price-gouging after
 it was awarded a contract by ICANN in March 2011 to be the sole 
registry for top-level domain names in .xxx. Other top-level domain 
names are .com and .org.

Manwin
 claimed that it was forced to buy expensive .xxx domain names that it 
already had purchased in .com. It said such 'defensive registrations' 
were needed to prevent confusion that would result if others were 
allowed to buy them.

ICM and
 ICANN, Manwin alleged, 'conspired to eliminate competition in the 
markets for certain .xxx registry services, with the intent to injure 
competition and consumers.'

In court documents filed throughout the litigation, ICM and ICANN denied the allegations that they violated antitrust laws.

Thylmann, 35, faces charges of avoiding paying tax on the Â£60million his online sex empire is said to earn each year.

Manwin claimed that it was forced to buy expensive .xxx domain names that it already had purchased in .com

He was extradited to his home country from Belgium, where he now lives.

Thylmann's
 online porn video network includes seven of the world's most popular 
adult sites - including YouPorn, Brazzers, PornHub and MyDirtyHobby - 
run under the auspices of industry-leading umbrella company Manwin.

Over
 the past decade, the reclusive computer programmer - nicknamed the The 
Ruler in the Realm of Lust by Germany's Focus magazine - has 
revolutionised the business of pornography consumption.

His
 websites operate by the same principle as YouTube, allowing visitors - 
around 16 billion per month - to watch videos for free and generating 
income through advertising.

Sex
 'pay sites' appear alongside and offer longer, full-length porn videos.
 Only a fraction are reported to use these, but this is sufficient to 
bring in revenues in excess of Â£60m each year.

The
 rise of YouPorn and similar free sex sites has crippled the traditional
 porn industry, which offers sex film cinemas, pornographic DVDs, 
magazines and sex shops.

According
 to European press reports, Thylmann has denied that he avoided taxes, 
claiming that he was legally minimising his tax liabilities.
