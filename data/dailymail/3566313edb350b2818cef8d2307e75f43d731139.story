Tragic: Vicky Shachtay, 23, pictured here with her six-year-old daughter, was killed by the parcel explosion

A disabled mother has been killed by a blast triggered when she opened a package delivered by hand to her home, police said last night.

Vicky Shachtay, 23, died in the explosion at her apartment in Innisfail, 75miles north of Calgary, Alberta, on Friday morning.

A 30-year-old carer who was in the property at the time escaped uninjured.

Ms Schachtay's six-year-old daughter was at school when the incident took place at 9am.

The mother had been in a wheelchair for several years after being involved in a car crash.

Police are warning people in the town, which has a population of 8,000, to be on their guard and wary of unexpected packages in the post, particularly if they have been hand-delivered.

Yesterday her house had been cordoned off while police carried out a forensic investigation at the scene.

The blast had knocked one window out of the property.

Ms Schachtay was not 'known' to police and neighbours have no idea why the mother, who lived in a two-storey apartment block, was targeted.

Police spokesman Sgt Patrick Webb said: 'It is a tragedy and we're trying to determine exactly what happened. We're going all out on this one.

'At this time, we are treating it as a murder, as we do normally with all sudden unexplained deaths.'

Ms Shachtay's neighbours described hearing a loud 'bang' that shook the apartment building.

Garrette Stewart, who lives in the apartment above the victim, said the explosion shook the whole house and the windows on the first floor were blown out.

'I was sitting on the couch and it shook the whole house. It was pretty scary,' he told Winnipeg CTV.

No funeral arrangements have been announced yet. Ms Schachtay's six-year-old daughter is being looked after by family.

It is the first time someone has been killed by a package bomb in Canada since December 2006.
