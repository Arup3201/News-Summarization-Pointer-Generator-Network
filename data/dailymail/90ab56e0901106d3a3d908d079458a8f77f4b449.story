Lily Willis, nine, has taken her first steps since beating cancer and having metal bones fitted in her leg which grow

All brave Lily Willis will be hoping for in 2013 is the chance to walk on her own two feet.

The nine-year-old from Great Lumley, County Durham, has taken her first steps since having metal bones fitted in her right leg which grow.

Doctors had to take drastic action after they discovered a tumour called osteosarcoma in her leg after she came home from school limping.

Her entire knee, tibia and part of her femur had to be removed and rebuilt with stainless steel adjustable bones.

The operation took 14-hours to complete and Lily had to undergo a gruelling course of chemotherapy afterwards.

As she grows, a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow 
doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh as required.

She has now been told she has beaten the cancer and has also managed to walk again for the first time.

Her family are 
looking forward to the New Year after the news was delivered by medics 
at the Great North Children's Hospital at Newcastle's Royal Victoria 
Infirmary.

Lily's mum Tori, 
30, said: 'We have got a bottle of Champagne ready. It is brilliant that
Lily doesn't have to have any more treatment and no more chemotherapy.

'We have her back. It has been a huge weight off our minds when we think some kids might not be as lucky as Lily.

'She has been so amazing. It has all gone over her head and she has just got on with it.'

Now the family, which includes dad Bryan, 40, and Lily's sisters Ruby, two, and Jessie, five, can look to the future together.

'We are so proud of her, and looking back we don't know how we have got through it,' said Tori.

Tori said Lily's health is going from strength-to-strength now her course of chemotherapy has finished.

And while she may have to have more surgery when she reaches her teenage years, the Lumley Junior School pupil is looking forward to getting her independence back.

Tori said: 'Lily is doing a full week at school now as well and she keeps saying how much energy she has.'

Lily will also be going to Disneyland Paris for her 10th birthday in November after all her pals at school and other friends of the family got involved in a fundraising campaign.

'She can't wait - she wants to go now,' said Tori. "We have decided to go then so that Lily is as strong as she possibly can be.

'She wanted to go straightaway but her consultant said she can't go yet.

'2012 could not have got any worse and we all know that 2013 is going to be a good year for us.'
