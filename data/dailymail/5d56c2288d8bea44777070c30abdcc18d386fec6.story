American Ryan Moore successfully defended his CIMB Classic title in Malaysia on Sunday, as compatriot Gary Woodland again had to settle for second place.

Moore, who beat Woodland in a play-off at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club 12 months ago, carded a closing 67 to finish 17 under par, three shots ahead of Woodland, Kevin Na and Spain's Sergio Garcia.

'It's been a great week,' said Moore, who recorded eight birdies and three bogeys after beginning the final round tied for the lead with Na. 'I'm a little bit lost for words right now.

'To come back and defend like this, that's something I have never done so it makes it that much more special. To do it the way I did, hitting some great shots coming down the stretch and making some birdies when I needed to, is great.

'Last year was a lot more stressful. I had to get up and down from 65 yards just to get into a play-off. I got to enjoy this more, although I was still making it a little bit too interesting.'

Woodland also carded a closing 67 with six birdies and just one bogey on the par-five 18th, while Na birdied four of his first nine holes but then bogeyed the 13th and ran up a double-bogey six on the 17th to end his chances.

Garcia was also left to rue a costly double-bogey, in his case on the par-five 10th after a front nine of 33, although he bounced back with birdies on the 11th and 14th to post a final round of 69.

'Congrats to R.Moore, hit some great shots coming in!' the Spaniard Tweeted. 'I felt like I had a good chance but the lost ball on 10 didn't help.We'll keep at it!'

Ryder Cup team-mate Lee Westwood, who won the Malaysian Open on the same course in April, finished in a tie for 13th after a closing 68.
