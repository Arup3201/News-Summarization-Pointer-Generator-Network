TV chef Jamie Oliver has admitted that he has just finished reading his first book.....at the age of 38.

Jamie, who is the world’s wealthiest chef with a fortune of £150million, admitted that he has just finished reading Catching Fire, the 391-page sci-fi sequel to Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.

The pukka chef, who has written almost 20 cook books, said he had ‘never got through a book’ before reading Catching Fire because of his dyslexia.

Speaking at the weekend, when asked what
the last book was he read, the father-of-four said: 'I’m dyslexic and 
until recently I’d never got through a book.

'But I read Catching Fire. I loved disappearing into a story.

Catching Fire takes up the story where Hunger Games left off. Teenagers Katniss and Peta have just risked their lives to win the annual televised fight to the death in the fictional nation Panem.

The victory means they have won themselves and their families a life of safety within the harsh regime run by the Capitol. But a rebellion is brewing and the teenagers have been made the faces of the uprising.

'The one book I nearly finished was Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain,' said Jamie Oliver

Jamie had previously admitted that he ‘got bored easily’ when reading, and said: 'I’ve never read a book in my life, which I know sounds incredibly ignorant but I’m dyslexic and I get bored easily.

'The one book I nearly finished was Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain.

'But then the author came to Britain and didn’t stop slagging me off for five years.

'So on principle I threw it on the fire.

'He’s since apologised and we’ve made up.

'I should probably read the rest now.'

Jamie also admitted that he ‘secretly collected driftwood’ to make chopping boards, which he said cost a ‘small fortune’ in shops.

He said: 'I secretly collect driftwood.

'It might sound a bit mad, but a solid bit of driftwood makes for a perfect chopping board, the kind you’d pay a small fortune for in a department store.'

Describing his own schooling, at Newport Free Grammar School, in 
Essex, the multi-millionaire said: 'It was with great regret that I 
didn't do better at school.

'People just thought I was thick. It was a struggle.

'I never really had anyone to help that understood dyslexia and who could bring out my strengths.'
