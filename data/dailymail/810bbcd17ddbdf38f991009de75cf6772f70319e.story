Most women wear perfume to mask their body odor, but one artist is making waves for doing exactly the opposite.

New York-basedhas launched a fragrance called Eau de M, which is crafted using the 'aromatic elements from her body' - namely her sweat, tears and hair.

The unusual scent debuted in the May issue of Harper's Bazaar, with a description calling it 'unique and intensely addictive' as well as 'wet, sweet and sensual like a hot, humid summer day.'

Au naturel: New York-based artist Martynka Wawrzyniak has debuted a fragrance called Eau de M, which is crafted using the 'aromatic elements from her body' - namely her sweat, tears and hair

The former model's sweat was produced by sleeping in the same T-shirt for five nights, or by doing Bikram yoga and then putting her shirt in a sterile mason jar.

To elicit and then bottle her tears, she watched films and cartoons that reminded her of her childhood in communist Poland.

According to her website, Martynka spent a year working with a research team of Hunter College chemistry students, who helped create an 'olfactory-based self-portrait' based on the scents she produced.

We asked a selection of MailOnline employees what they thought of the fragrance. (The women knew what it was, and the men did not.)

Here's what the women had to say...

It's that smell of a girl's T-shirt when her deodorant almost but doesn't quite completely mask the sweat smell.

It smells tangy, like sweat on a summer's day.

And the men said...

To extract her scents, the students - 
overseen by Professor Donna McGregor - used a complex process of 
treating 100per cent cotton clothes that she had worn, then washing the 
clothes with ethanol and leaving it to evaporate.

'Any water in the sweat samples allows for 
bacteria to grow,' Dr McGregor explained to the Wall Street Journal. 'That's what gives rise to the 
body odor that everybody associates with sweat or the scent of the human body.'

The
 process left behind just the aromatic essential oils, which were then 
delivered to scent director Dawn Goldworm and perfumer Yann Vasnier so 
they could reconstruct her natural aroma.

The elements they ultimately chose were tropical coconut infused with cacao absolute, fresh grass and passionfruit - abnormally fresh human scents that are likely linked to the fact that she is a vegan.

'The analysis of the exact odor... there were a lot of materials that are not available in the perfumist's palette. So you have to recreate it with lots of pieces from [different elements],' Mr Vasnier told VICE.

'We tried a musky smell, a milky smell, a sweaty fruity smell. It's hard to recreate the exact molecules of her body.'

Harper's
 Bazaar readers likely didn't even look twice at the page in the 
magazine, which looked like any other fragrance ad, with a nude portrait of the artist and a 
photo of a perfume bottle.

And that's exactly what Martynka intended, as she explains in her artist's statement about the work.

Have a whiff: A scent strip of the unusual 'perfume' was featured in the May issue of Harper's Bazaar (pictured)

'By running a fake advertisement with a 
scent strip in the full print run of Harper's Bazaar (circulation 
950,000) magazine, I will be expanding the self-portrait beyond the 
traditional art context by performing olfactory guerrilla tactic,' she wrote.

'The advertisement will become a vehicle for spreading my 
essence across the country, letting the mass market consume artwork 
unwittingly.'

She added 
that the fragrance and its production has a special significance. 'The 
piece represents the true essence of a woman - free of visual 
prejudice,' she explained.

In an interview with Gravure, Marynka explains the logic behind using smell as an artistic medium.

'[it's] the perfect medium to experience something viscerally because there is nothing else but feeling,' she said.

'You're literally just inhaling through your nose, and it's going directly to your brain and creating feelings and memories - it's purely primal.'
