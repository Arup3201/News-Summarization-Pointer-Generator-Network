A schoolboy who raped a six-year-old girl twice has walked free from court despite telling a probation officer 'I don't care' when asked how his young victim felt following her ordeal.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted forcing the girl to carry out a sex act on two occasions, Ipswich Youth Court heard.

But during a meeting with a court official, who was compiling a pre-sentence report, the youth showed no remorse for his victim.

No remorse: The 12-year-old boy walked free from Ipswich Youth Court, pictured, despite telling a probation officer 'I don't care how she feels' when asked about his victim

Prosecutor Simon Newell said the boy was asked what he felt about the impact of his crimes on his victim and replied: 'I don’t care how she feels.'

District Judge Celia Dawson told him that she was not sending him to a secure youth offending unit because she did not want him to be in the company of ‘older and more sophisticated criminals’.

The boy, who lives on the Suffolk and Norfolk border, was given a 12 month referral order and a 12 month restraining order banning him from contacting the victim or her family.

He was also ordered to pay £300 in compensation to the girl, having admitted two counts of rape at an earlier hearing.

The court heard that the boy’s parents took him to a police station when they heard about the sex attack allegations where he admitted what he had done straight away.

'I hope you are aware if you don’t change your attitude you may have very serious problems in the future.'

District Judge Celia Dawson

Sentencing the boy, District Judge Dawson told him: 'I have read the report and of course it gives me some cause for concern because of your attitude to what you did.

'I hope in a way that is you trying to be brave and tough things out, and that when you start work with the Youth Offending Team you will begin to think about what you did, about how serious it was, and about how badly this has affected (the girl).

'I hope you are aware if you don’t change your attitude you may have very serious problems in the future.

'What you did was very, very wrong. Indeed you forced her to do something she did not want to do and didn’t understand.'

A statement from the victim’s mother said the girl has been left frightened and very upset by what happened.

The judge told the boy: 'That’s an awful thing. She’s only a little girl.'

Unfortunately I don't think this boy will change his attitude and he will have serious problems in the future!

He should have been given a suspended sentence, which would not have been subject to early release, and a 20 year criminal record.

British Justice ... what a farce. 12 month order to stay away from the family ! He should be banned for life!
