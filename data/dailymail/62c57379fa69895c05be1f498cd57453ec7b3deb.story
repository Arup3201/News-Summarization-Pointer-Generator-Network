Country music superstar Brad Paisley and his actress wife Kimberly Williams-Paisley admit they were taken in by a con artist pretending to be the mother of a little girl dying of cancer.

The celebrity couple spent 10 days convinced they were emailing, texting and in Paisley's case singing to a girl named Claire who had deadly brain cancer.

Along with the Paisleys, a Wednesday Nightline segment uncovers a slew of other celebrity victims of the hoax including reality star Kate Gosselin, hosts of ABC's Wipeout John Henson and Jill Wagner, and some Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.

Duped: Country music star Brad Paisley and his Father of the Bride actress wife Kimberly Williams-Paisley say they were taken in by a con artist claiming to be the mother of a girl dying of cancer

According to Williams-Paisley, who made her name as the the bride in Father of the Bride, the hoax began slowly and very convincingly.

'She said that her daughter had begged her to get in touch with me,' she tells Nightline.

Shocked: Williams-Paisley, who now appears in Nashville but may be best known as the bride in the film Father of the Bride, was among a long list celebrities who were apparently taken in by this con artist who said her daughter suffered from neuroblastoma, an often fatal form of childhood brain cancer

It was in an email the actress received from a woman calling herself Carrie and claiming her daughter had end stage neuroblastoma, an often fatal pediatric cancer.

'Well, to be honest,' the email reads, 'with all the chaos and excitement that ensued with Claire coming home from the hospital with hospice. I forgot.'

Williams-Paisley, who now appears in 
the series Nashville, says the hoax was convincing because it didn't 
initially ask for anything or seem all that interested in her as a 
celebrity.

'It sounded 
very sort of real,' Kimberly said. 'But she wasn't dying to get a hold 
of me. You know, that was kind of the beginning of the manipulation.'

For ten days, the couple exchanged dozens of emails, texts, and phones calls according to ABC News.

The
con artist even sent a journal entry in what appears to be children's 
handwriting. From the entry, which is filled with apparently fake 
spelling errors:

'My kim
I am not scard to die now you filled up my heart with so much love I am
sad to leve you because no body can make me smile like you do.'

A smiling sun is drawn in crayon at the bottom: 'love your claire.'

Brad Paisley even got on the phone and sang a Amazing Grace to what he thought was a dying child.

'You're
singing to someone's dying kid,' he says. 'And in the middle of it, 
there's no way that's not real. How can that not be real?'

Celebrity victims: Among those who were tricked by the woman, who called herself Carrie Kahler in letters to the Paisley's, were hosts of obstacle course game show Wipeout John Henson and Jill Wagner

Wide net: The band Little Big Town was also conned by the woman, who Nightline says they tracked down to a campground in Wyoming

The couple only became suspicious once the so-called little girl died and, in an angry email, the mother refused to give them an address where they could send flowers.

'Every red flag went up': Paisley says he even sang Amazing Grace on the phone to what he thought was the little girl over the 10 days it took them to realize they were facing an attempted scammer

'I don't need you to pray for me. Doesn't seem like god hears much of anything these days,' she wrote.

They were shocked.

'I had a physical reaction,' Kimberly said. 'Every red flag went up that I couldn't ask a simple question.'

In an episode to air Wednesday, Nightline speaks to the couple, whose ordeal ended there. But the worst part, they say, is that the woman used photographs plucked from a website of an actual little girl dying of neuroblastoma.

'That's the sickest part about this to me,' Brad said. 'That is the part that when I start to talk about that, that's when I get really mad. That there were real kids, that there were real photos involved.'

Nightline also describes a laundry list of other celebrities who fell into the hoax: reality star Kate Gosselin, Wipeout gameshow hosts John Henson and Jill Wagner, some Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, and singer Natalie Grant, and the band Little Big Town.

They also tell their story of tracking down to the woman behind the hoax to a campground in Wyoming.

'We all were devastated by it and it's so disturbing that someone was claiming the identity of a little child with cancer and tried to pass it off as her child,' Natalie Grant tells Nightline.
