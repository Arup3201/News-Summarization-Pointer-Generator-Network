Georgios Samaras has completed his move to West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer to boost Alan Irvine’s attacking options.

The Greece international striker is identified as a player who could operate as a centre forward or in wide areas. His two-footed ability is also seen as a plus.

Samaras, 29, was without a club after Celtic failed to offer him new terms at the end of his Parkhead contract. He attracted interest from Sampdoria, Sevilla and Hamburg and also held discussions with Malaga.

Transfer: Greek international Georgios Samaras has signed for West Brom on a two-year deal 

But he arrived in Birmingham for a medical on Thursday and has now put pen to paper.

Irvine said of his new signing: 'We’ve signed a player with vast experience and I’m delighted to welcome Sami to the club,' said the head coach.

'He has played a lot of football at the highest levels – Champions League, European Championships and World Cups - and the feedback we’ve got on him, from people like Neil Lennon, states he thrives on the big occasion.

'He will certainly play in plenty of those in the Barclays Premier League.

Contract: Samaras joined Alan Irvine's side on a free transfer after failing to agree a new contract with Celtic

'Georgios has played in big games for a Celtic team that have often had a lot of the ball and have had to work hard to break the opposition down.

'But he has also shown another side to his game in other matches when they haven’t seen as much of the ball.'

Samaras will not feature against Southampton on Saturday as he needs to improve his fitness following a summer without pre-season.

He was on duty for Greece at the World Cup in Brazil and scored a last-minute winning penalty against Ivory Coast to dramatically secure his nation’s place in the knock-out phase.

Experience: Samaras has 78 international caps and also has Champions League experience

Standing at 6ft 4in he brings a physical presence and Champions League experience with Celtic, where he scored 74 goals in 248 games in all competitions. 

Samaras got eight goals in 54 games during his previous spell in the Premier League with City between 2005 and 2008. He has 78 Greece caps and nine goals.

West Brom are also on the lookout for one or two more wingers, with West Ham’s Matt Jarvis and Atletico Madrid’s Christian Rodriguez linked. Both deals would not be without their difficulties however and the search is ongoing.
