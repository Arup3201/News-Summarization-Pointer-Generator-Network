When Ivan Gazidis began the final negotiations to sign Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from Southampton, Arsenal’s chief executive arrived with a battery of lawyers and accountants by his side.

They all went into a private meeting room with Saints officials, breaking off for hushed conversations in corridors whenever the selling club raised the stakes.

By then Oxlade-Chamberlain had, unknowingly, been the subject of a complicated economic formula established by the Harvard business boffins employed on a sizeable retainer by the club.

Problems: A resigned Arsene Wegner looks on from the bench as Arsenal lose to Aston Villa

The bid Arsenal have submitted for 
Newcastle and France midfielder Yohan Cabaye appears, on the surface, to
be a knee-jerk reaction to the injury crisis and the pressure put on 
them by fans to ‘SPEND SPEND SPEND’ during their defeat against Aston 
Villa.

Instead, he has been 
on the radar of Arsenal’s European scout Gilles Grimandi for some time. 
But the businessmen across the pond slow down the recruitment process.

Gazidis’
belief in their academic acumen is total, although he has always been 
reluctant to explain how players as bad as Nicklas Bendtner, told he 
could skip training to go back to Denmark three weeks ago, is earning 
£55,000 a week.

Arsene 
Wenger, who earns £7.6million a year at the Emirates, authorised 
Bendtner’s contract when the striker was still boasting about becoming 
the best player in the world. Arsenal are proud of their due diligence, 
justifying frugal spending in the Kroenke years by the business brains 
brought in to put every potential recruit through a complicated 
financial model.

Crocked: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain could be out for six months after his knee injury

Wenger 
believes in the scientific principles established at the Emirates, 
although his team of scouts around the world still work to the formula 
he brought with him in 1996.

His
scouting team, headed by Steve Rowley, are asked to identify players 
with three distinctive characteristics: pace, power and football intelligence.

If only they had added a fourth — the mentality of champions — they really would be in business.

The
dynamic training-ground environment, which was once the envy of the 
world when Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and  Robert Pires were pushing
each other to reach new targets each day, has slowly been eroded.

There
is tension in the air between Rowley and Bob Arber, Arsenal’s head of 
youth. At games, they don’t even speak to each other.

Glory days: Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp were iconic figures during Arsenal's success

They
should be in constant communication, preserving the future of the club 
by monitoring the progress of young players at Arsenal’s academy and 
bringing in the next generation. Instead, the young Gunners are on the 
end of some hidings, losing 7-0 to Conference club Luton and beaten by a
scratch team of Colchester kids 5-1 before the start of the season.

This is no way to run a football club and most people know that there is room for improvement in every area at Arsenal.

Wenger has too much power — given the freedom of the football club because of his achievements at Highbury.

There
he won three Barclays  Premier League titles, four FA Cups and took 
Arsenal to within a whisker of beating Barcelona at the Stade de France 
in 2006.

He knows the inner workings of every area of the club, which is rare in the modern game.

Spend, spend, spend: An Arsenal fan makes his feelings known to Wenger

Wenger’s
detailed knowledge of every player’s contract even created an issue 
when Oxlade-Chamberlain was making substitute appearances for Arsenal 
last season.

Written into 
the England winger’s deal is a clause stating that Arsenal must pay 
Saints £10,000 every time Oxlade-Chamberlain appears for more than 20 
minutes.

Incredibly a trend 
emerged, with Wenger bringing him off the bench after 72 minutes (v 
Stoke), 73  minutes (Liverpool), 72 minutes (Coventry), 65 minutes 
(Norwich), 76 minutes (Fulham), 86 minutes (Tottenham), 67 minutes  
(Swansea), 73 minutes (West Ham), 71 minutes (Swansea), and 75  minutes 
(Reading).

Arsenal’s 
accounts department were stunned to receive an email from Southampton 
demanding payment for the appearances, with the south coast club 
justifying their argument based on stoppage time.

Eventually
Arsenal agreed to pay for the appearances and the story worked its way 
around the offices at the Emirates with bafflement among staff.

They know Wenger calls the shots, but he is slow to move for targets.

Slow: Arsenal were too late when it came to trying to sign Wilfried Zaha from Crystal Palace

Last
season Rowley was a regular at Crystal Palace matches, following 
Wilfried Zaha around the country as Arsenal stepped up their interest.

Rowley
would pop up at Leicester or Burnley, watching Zaha closely as Palace 
headed for the play-offs and promotion back to the  Barclays Premier 
League.

When it came to the 
crunch, Wenger’s assistant manager Steve Bould picked up the phone to an
old friend at Palace to ask for his assessment of the £15m forward.

By then it was too late. Zaha had been given permission to meet Sir Alex Ferguson and the deal was wrapped up within a day.

The
England winger is another one to get away, but everyone at Arsenal 
knows that Wenger — a thoroughly charming and decent guy — has failed to
keep pace with the modern game.

Managers need technical assistance and expertise, something the top clubs in the Premier League have finally accepted.

Partnership: Jose Mourinho works with director of football Michael Emenalo to recruit players at Chelsea

At
Chelsea, Jose Mourinho has returned to Stamford Bridge on the 
understanding that he must work closely with director of football 
Michael Emenalo on transfer targets.

Manuel
Pellegrini is working under the technical team — Ferran Soriano and 
Txiki Begiristain — as Manchester City plan for five trophies in five 
years.

Tottenham have 
recruited Franco Baldini from Roma to work with Andre Villas-Boas as 
Daniel Levy returns to the two-tiered European management structure he 
has always favoured.

Wenger 
has never been interested, preferring to rely on his own judgment and 
using Dick Law’s contacts book when they make a move on a player.

Law,
who is based in Dallas, met Wenger when he was working in south America
and they became close during David Dein’s time as vice-president.

He
is popular with agents around the world, but they become frustrated 
when he pulls the plug on deals because Wenger must always have the 
final word.

As Arsenal fans are aware, nothing adds up at the Emirates any more.
