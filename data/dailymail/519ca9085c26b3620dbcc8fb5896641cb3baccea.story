History tells us that Vikings are not ones to cross, a lesson hard learned by this fox who dared tresspass on the land of a Norwegian Forest Cat.

Leon the cat did not take lightly to the wild fox approaching his owner's bins and looked more like a mountain lion as he launched himself after the intruding predator.

Leon had no problem showing the fox who was boss, and swiftly chased the fox off his owner's property in Troms, northern Norway.

Supercat: There is no mistaking the fear in the fox's eyes as he realises he has messed with the wrong cat

Leon the lion: The cat dashed after the fox with the fearlessness of a much larger feline and chased it down

Outfoxed: The fox bitterly regretted his decision to ever come near Leon's owner's bins

Owner Evy Hind, 48, caught the moment  Leon turned guard cat outside her house, using lightning speed to run down the fox.

It is clear the fox was in no mood to mess with this killer cat as he quickly sprinted off.

Evy was enjoying her morning coffee on the porch when the drama unfolded.

She
 said four-year-old Leon has always been known for being a bit of a 
grumpy cat, not afraid to throw his weight around to get his way.

The terrified Mr Fox: The fox appears to be barking for mercy as Leon nips at his tail as to get him off the grass outside his owner's house in Troms, Norway

Closing in: It takes a pretty brave creature to stand up to Leon - and this fox was not among them

Off he goes: The fox runs as fast as his legs can carry him with Leon at his heels

Protector of the realm: Norwegian Forest Cat Leon looks on as the fox runs off into the distance

The
 housewife said: ‘Leon chased and followed the fox that came into our 
yard, he doesn't like foxes and they went at it like cats and dogs.

‘With his big hair Leon obviously looks pretty scary because the fox which was bigger than him was obviously scared of a fight.

‘The
 fox came into his territory so Leon went into battle mode, I ended up 
having a super morning with a cup of coffee and my camera.’

Leon
 is a Norwegian Forest Cat, a breed known for its lion-like features and
 long hair. Is the breed's name alludes, it is especially adapted to 
live in the cold Norse climate with its long hair and sturdy body.

It
 is thought its ancestors served as mouse catchers on Viking ships and 
that the modern Norwegian Forest Cat's ancestors are the 
'mountain-dwelling fairy cat' referred to in Norse legends.
