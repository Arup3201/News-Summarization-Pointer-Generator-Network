A four-year-old cancer survivor's dream Make-A-Wish Foundation trip to Disney World has been cancelled by her own father - because he thinks only dying children deserve the charity's money.

McKenna May, from Haskins, Ohio, was granted $3,500 (£2,235) to fund a once-in-a-lifetime holiday to the Florida theme park, after spending half her short life undergoing agonising treatment for leukemia.

But the brave little girl has been left devastated after her father William May refused to sign a consent form allowing her to go,

McKenna May, here with her mother Whitney, spent two years of her short life fighting leukemia and she's now finally free and clear

Dream trip denied: May's father banned her from accepting a free trip to Disney World, because she's not dying of cancer

Since she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2010, McKenna has undergone 15 spinal taps, multiple chemotherapy treatments, and a series of steroid injects. She has been hospitalised numerous times.

She underwent her final treatment last month after showing signs of beating the disease, but won't won't be officially cancer-free for another five years,

To cheer her up during the painful treatments, McKenna's mother Whitney Hughes and grandmother Lori Helppie applied to the Make-A-Wish foundation.

Moved by her plight, the charity granted McKenna her wish and agreed to pay for the family to travel to Disney World in Florida.

Fund-raising: McKenna's mother and grandmother are now trying to raise the money so she can meet her hero, Mickey Mouse

But before the trip could be booked, both parents had to sign a consent form. And William May refused.

Speaking to the Bowling Green Sentinel-Tribune
 newspaper, he argued the gift was an improper use of donations, and 
that handouts should be reserved for 'kids who only have six months to 
live'.

Mrs Hughes is convinced her 
ex-husband is trying to punish her after he was granted just visitation 
rights to his daughter earlier this year.

And
 Mr May admitted he is angry with his ex-wife and her mother, who he 
claims are preventing him from seeing his daughter. He told the 
Sentinel-Tribune: 'I wasn't allowed to be involved. It ticked me off.'

Ms
 Hughes and Ms Hellpie have refused to give up hope they can still take 
McKenna to Disney World and are attempting the raise the money 
themselves, passing around collection jars in their local community.

Ms Helppie said: 'The important thing is to get her there.She loves Mickey Mouse. She loves Cinderella.'

Ms Hughes added: 'She's really excited. It's all she's talked about for the last three months.'

Charity chiefs are, meanwhile, bewildered by the row - having ruled McKenna was clearly deserving of the trip.

Susan McConnell, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish for Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, told the Sentinel-Tribune: 'The doctors are the ones who determine if she is qualified. She's been through a lot. What I really feel bad about is she is stuck in the middle.'
