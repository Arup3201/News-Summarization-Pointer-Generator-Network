The Virgin Galactic space tourism program was plagued with fuel issues for years ahead of the fatal mid-air explosion today that came after the company's space-craft trialed a new propulsion system.

One pilot died yesterday when a SpaceShipTwo craft exploded at 45,000ft not long after igniting its engines, which were using a new rocket fuel for the first time.

The disaster over California's Mojave Desert also left another pilot, who managed to parachute out of the space plane, in hospital with serious injuries.

Explosion: The Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo exploded at 45,000ft today over the Mojvae Desert, California

Moments before: The spacecraft had just fired its engines after detaching from the WhiteKnightTwo launching craft

Space plane: There had been complications developing the proper fuel system for SpaceShipTwo - and experts say engine troubles are probably behind the explosion

Investigators have yet to decide what caused the accident, but experts have said engine problems are the most likely cause

In the wake of the disaster reports emerged telling how a test engine blew up in 2007, killing three people.

It has also emerged that one of Virgin's star pilots, who left the company for a competitor, had characterized the solid rocket fuel used until recent as being unstable during tests.

The SpaceShipTwo vessel, which is carried to 45,000ft by a separate airplane before turning its own engines on, is propelled by a mixture of two fuels, a liquid and a solid.

Before each flight it is loaded up with a tank of pressurized nitrous oxide and a separate, solid fuel, which are mixed when the engine ignites.

Until the latest flight, SpaceShipTwo had used hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) - a type of rubber - as the solid component.

2007 disaster: A test of liquid nitrous oxie fuel in the Mojave Desert in 2007 killed three people working on the Virgin Galactic engines. Picture is the aftermath

But for the most recent launch they swapped to a polyamide grain fuel - a type of plastic - which had been tested on the ground but not on board SpaceShipTwo before.

The first disaster in the fuel history of Virgin Galactic came in 2007, when an early version of the nitrous oxide liquid fuel tank exploded, killing three workers.

The blast, at an outdoor test facility belonging to partner company Scaled Composites, killed employees Todd Ivens, Eric Blackwell and Charles May, who were watching the test from behind a chain link fence.

Concerns: Pilot Brian Binnie, who used to be part of Virgin Galactic, spoke of 'instabilities' in solid fuels

It was a 'cold flow' experiment, which means the fuel was not ignited. The incident prompted a thorough redesign of the tank, and also led to a $28,000 fine for Scaled Composites. The cause has never been determined.

However, years later it was the solid part of the fuel mix which was a cause for concern from those close to the project.

Brian Binnie, who piloted SpaceShipOne - an earlier model of the plane - had mentioned 'instabilities' in the solid fuel - at that time HTPB.

In an interview with popularmechanics.com, he said of the solid fuel source: 'It was full of instabilities initially. We had startup instabilities and we had end-of-burn instabilities

In their efforts to fix the problem, the engineers 'did everything but break down and pray to God to show us the light of day.'

Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides announced the switch to the plastic fuel earlier this year, saying it performed better than HTPB and could send the rocket even higher.

Though the investigation into the crash's causes is expected to take weeks, experts have said engine trouble is the most probable cause.

Speaking to the New Scientist,  Richard Osborne, chair of the British Interplanetary Society Technical Committee, said: 'I just cannot see that anything else [but engine failure] would result in the amount of damage.'

'I have been saying now since about 2008, 2009, that motor's a mistake.

'They should go with a liquid. I've not wavered in that. It's very very sad to see this happen.'

The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board (NSTB) have both announced investigations into the crash, with which Virgin Galactic has said it will co-operate fully.
