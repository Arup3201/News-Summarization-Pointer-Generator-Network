A teenage girl who is believed to have travelled to Syria to join the fight against Islamic State was identified yesterday.

She is Silhan Ozcelik, who went missing a month ago and is thought to be the first UK female to volunteer against the fanatics.

Police have pinned an appeal poster to a noticeboard at the Kurdish Community Association in Haringey, north London, where she was an active member.

A Kurdish teenager from London who is feared to have joined the fight against Isis in Syria has been named as 17-year-old Silhan Ozcelik, pictured above

Describing Silhan as a missing person, the poster says the teenager was last seen on the morning of October 27 at St Pancras international rail station.

Officers think she caught a train to Belgium and then travelled to Syria probably via the Turkish border.

It is possible that Silhan, who is a high achiever at school and hoped to become a human rights lawyer, wanted to join the YPJ, an all-female militia protecting Kurds from the IS militants. However, according to her family, she went to Syria simply to carry out humanitarian work.

Her brother Engin told the Mail that their parents – Sultan and Ergun, both 51 – were unhappy about the posters. ‘We are not very happy about that because it has given an image of her that is wrong and upsetting,’ said the 26-year-old.

‘We are 100 per cent sure she has gone away to carry out humanitarian and charity work and not to become a fighter against IS.’ His sister has taken part in protests in London against atrocities by IS forces.

The Kurdish association’s 50-year-old chairman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘She was upset about what has been happening to Kurdish people abroad. The police have called into the association twice in recent weeks looking for more information and they appear very worried about her.’   

Merciless: Isis fighters in Raqqa, Syria

British police have arrested a man alleged to have helped the girl to travel to Belgium from where she planned to join Kurdish guerrilla fighters, according to Arman Banirad, of the Kurdish Community Association in Haringey.

He also said that British Kurds are travelling to join the fight against Isis in Syria. 

Mr Banirad told MailOnline: ‘She was an activist and very politically in tune with the movement.

‘As many people are, she had a terrible feeling of impotence about not being able to do much here. She was very reserved and never discussed anything with people here.

‘Afterwards when we realised she had gone, I spoke to a lot of individuals and no-one had any idea this was going through her head.

‘I can’t confirm that she has gone to fight or not because after she went everything went quiet.’

He said many in the Kurdish community felt the same: ‘They are fighting for humanity and it is better to join the Kurdish YPJ than to join ISIS. Personally I believe that as long as it’s not Isis, it is obviously better.’

Mr Banirad said he knew of others seeking to join the fight: ‘This is a desperate situation. I have had cousins calling me up and crying down the phone, saying they can’t do nothing and the only thing they know is violence.

‘I always say the power of the pen is more powerful than the Kalshnikov but the whole region is under threat.’

It follows the news that two former British Army soldiers have travelled to Syria to fight against Isis.

James Hughes, 26, and Jamie Read, 24, are helping Kurdish peshmerga defend Kobane from the brutal terror group, whose ranks reportedly include 2,000 British Muslim recruits.

Photographs posted on Facebook show the pair on the Syrian frontline dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles, posing in bullet-scarred buildings.

On the website of the security firm they founded, Mr Hughes and Mr Read said they were motivated by 'conscience', not money, to travel to the warzone 'to assist innocent people in the face of terror from IS'.

Insisting they were volunteer fighters, not guns for hire, the ex-servicemen said they would 'not do nothing while innocent men, women and children are tortured and murdered by Islamic State while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill'.

They add: 'This is not a religious war nor is it a racial war, this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity.'

But Mr Read's mother said yesterday she was not happy that her son had travelled to Syrian Kurdistan – known as Rojava – to fight the Islamist extremists.

Speaking from her family home in Carlisle, Wendy Armiger, 43, said: 'He's been in touch to say he's okay, but I don't like the fact that he's gone there. It's his life, but he's my son.' Mr Hughes, from Malvern, Worcestershire, said he had served in the infantry for five years, including three tours of Afghanistan, before leaving earlier this year.

Mr Read, who lives in Newmains, North Lanarkshire, said in an online CV that he had been in the Army for three years, specialising in reconnaissance, before leaving in 2010 to work for private security companies.

In August, the friends set up the Pathfinder Group Terrorism & Conflict Research Center, a security company with the intention of providing 'specialist intelligence and surveillance services', and building up detailed information about terror groups. The firm's motto is: 'We will go where the rest fear to go'.

On Facebook, Mr Read describes how he had been involved in a fierce clash with IS jihadists.

He wrote that the 's*** hit the fan', prompting Jordan Matson, 28, a US veteran wounded fighting with the Kurds who is understood to have recruited the Britons, to reply: 'It's always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head.'

Graham Penrose, a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families, said: 'They are not being paid. They are not participating for any commercial gain.'  

Iraqi forces say they retook two towns north of Baghdad from Islamic State fighters today, driving them from strongholds they had held for months and clearing a main road from the capital to Iran.

There was no independent confirmation that the army, Shi'ite militia and Kurdish peshmerga forces had completely retaken Jalawla and Saadiya, about 70 miles north-east of Baghdad. Many residents fled the violence long ago.

At least 23 peshmerga and militia fighters were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting, medical and army sources said.

'We have liberated Jalawla and Saadiya,' said Mala Bakhtiar, a senior official in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party, speaking by phone from a nearby town. He estimated 50 Islamic State fighters were killed out of a force of 400.

Iraq's Shi'ite-led government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back the Islamic State since it swept through mainly Sunni Muslim provinces of northern Iraq in June, meeting virtually no resistance.

Last week the army broke a months-long siege of the country's largest refinery north of Baghdad, but Islamic State fighters continue to take territory in the western province of Anbar, which shares borders with Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

The militants have been fighting in the last two days to take full control of the Anbar provincial capital Ramadi. On Sunday, Iraqi and foreign jets struck Islamic State fighters near central Ramadi, provincial council member Mahmoud Ahmed Khalaf told Reuters. Clashes continued in the city, he said.

Jalawla and Saadiya are located in Diyala province which is mainly under the control of the Baghdad government forces and Kurdish peshmerga.

Recapturing the towns would help secure the Kurdish-controlled towns of Kalar and Khanaqin to the north as well as nearby dams and oil fields, peshmerga Secretary-General Jabbar Yawar said. It would also allow the road to be reopened between Baghdad and Khanaqin, close to the Iranian border.

While the hardline Sunni Islamic State forces have not advanced into Baghdad, they hold a ring of towns around the mainly Shi'ite capital and have claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in Shi'ite districts of the city.

A car bomb in the Shi'ite town of Yousufiya, 20 miles southeast of Baghdad, killed five people on Sunday, police and medics said. Two other bombs in towns near the capital killed four other people.
