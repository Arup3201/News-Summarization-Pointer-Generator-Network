A British couple who attempted suicide hours before they were due to be extradited to the U.S. say they felt like they had no options left.

Paul Dunham, who is accused of over-claiming £600,000 in expenses from a U.S. firm, spoke out as a judge warned he was at real risk of harming himself again.

He and his wife Sandra - who is accused of aiding and abetting him - were remanded in custody for their own safety last night, after a court heard claims they overdosed on medication as a 'cry for help'.

'No options left': Paul and Sandra Dunham were found on Thursday hours before the planned extradition

District Judge Howard Riddle told them at Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'There is simply no other conclusion that I can reach on the face of it than at the very least it was to delay or prevent the (extradition) process from taking place.

'In 14 days or thereabouts a decision will be taken that extradition is imminent and at that stage, despite the protestations that they won't, there is a real risk they will take steps to harm themselves.'

Speaking out yesterday, Mr Dunham said the pact was real and in no way a publicity stunt or an attempt to delay the extradition.

He explained that he and his wife had genuinely attempted to take their own lives because they could not face the prospect of dying in a U.S. jail. The court heard they had taken enough medication to do themselves serious harm.

'We fully expected that our lives would have ended that night', he told the Daily Telegraph.

Battle: The couple lost an appeal in February at the High Court, which ruled the breach of their human right to privacy was not serious enough to outweigh the need to extradite them on fraud charges, which they deny

The couple arrived under police escort yesterday at Westminster Magistrates' Court, where they were remanded

Search: Police were called to the couple's home in Northampton after they failed to answer the door

'It's a crude thing to say, but until you try to kill yourself, you don't know what it takes to do it. We basically didn't do it soon enough.

'If the police hadn't come into the house, if they had taken a couple of hours longer, then it would have happened according to our wishes.'

He added: 'We felt there was no hope - the choice was made'.

The alarm was raised on Thursday morning when the Dunhams failed to answer the door of their Northampton home for a planned appointment with a local journalist.

'It's a crude thing to say, but until
 you try to kill yourself, you don't know what it takes to do it'

The couple, who have five 
grandchildren, said they attempted the suicide pact after being told 
Theresa May had cancelled a planned meeting with their MP Andrea 
Leadsom.

Apart from the Prime Minister, Mrs May is the only person who can halt the extradition after the pair lost a High Court 
battle against extradition to Maryland on fraud charges.

Mr Dunham is accused of over-claiming
 $1million (£600,000) in expenses when he was chief executive of the U.S. firm PACE - but insists these were ‘wholly legitimate’ business expenses.

The case has caused anger over the 
use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for trial 
for what their supporters say amounts to a civil dispute.

Mrs Dunham is accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him.

The failed High Court case 
heard Mr Dunham had suffered several mini-strokes and mental health
 problems, and Mrs Dunham was suffering from depression.

Emergency: Police were called to the Dunhams' Northampton home by a worried journalist who had arrived to take a statement from the couple - only for them to fail to answer the door

But Mr Justice Simon said the breach of the couple's human rights was not significant enough to outweigh the need to extradite them.

Speaking from his hospital bed at Northampton General yesterday, where he was recovering after being taken off a drip, Mr Dunham said: ‘When we felt there was no hope, the prospect of what lay ahead of us in the US, we felt that wasn’t worth living for.’

'If you look statistically, white collar crime has a 98 per cent chance of going to a plea bargain.

'If you look at this in the cold light of day we have gone through this rationally so many times in our minds.

'Somewhere down the line someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain.

'We could easily be in the U.S. for six or eight years.

'We would return to the UK in our mid-sixties, with no money, no jobs and no home.

Treatment: The Dunhams both spent the night at Northampton General Hospital and are expected to be taken to Westminster Magistrates court when they are discharged

'Frankly that was a prospect we didn’t feel like enduring eight years of hell for.

'We rationally weighted up all the options and saw no other choice.

'We faced a three year wait for a 
trial in the U.S. and we were already told we were going to be held in a 
high security super max prison with a pretty harsh regime and it 
wouldn’t have the medical facilities for my health.

'We were facing the prospect of enduring eight years of hell, and are still facing the same dilemma.

'It’s a bit like when someone has a 
terminal illness, they will sometimes end their lives with the happy 
memories they once had rather than face the terminal illness.

'What we did wasn’t a publicity stunt,
 we fully expected not to be here today and we have to be grateful for 
the police and hospital staff for how they have looked after us over the
 last 24 hours.

'Now we are having to go to separate counselling meetings where we are really saying "what’s next?"

'Nothing’s really changed, the extradition warrant still exists and that hasn’t changed at all.'
