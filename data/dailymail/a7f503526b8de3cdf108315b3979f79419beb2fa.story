A woman who feared she would never have children has defied genetic odds of one in 100 million by becoming pregnant with identical triplets.

Annabelle Williams was heartbroken when she lost her baby daughter four months into the pregnancy last June, due to a rare birth defect which prevented her child's skull from developing properly.

But the 23-year-old and her husband James are now expecting three identical boys - the rarest kind of triplets.

Triple surprise: Annabelle Williams (with husband James) feared she might never have children. But to the couple's joy, they have been told they are expecting identical triplet boys

Big news: Scans revealed that Mrs Williams was expecting three identical boys, who all share one placenta. This phenomenon only happens once in every 60,000 pregnancies involving twins and is even rarer for triplets.

Recalling her first pregnancy, Mrs Williams, from Whitchurch, Cardiff, said: 'I had my first scan and everything was absolutely fine, but we went back a few weeks later and the doctors told me there was a problem.'

After doctors explained their baby had a neural tube defect affecting the back of her head, they made the difficult decision to have a termination.

'It was horrible,' said Mrs Williams. 'I had never even heard of the condition before, so it was a huge shock. The doctors told me it can be caused by a lack of folic acid and has a 1 per cent chance of occurring.'

After the termination, she and her Mr Williams, 24, a tattooist, had a series of medical tests.

'At that stage, I was scared we might never be able to have children, but the tests came back fine and the doctors told me to give my body some time to recover,' she said.

Joy: Two months after losing her daughter, Mrs Williams discovered she was pregnant again - with twins

Third time lucky: But later scans revealed a third baby

But just two months later, Mrs 
Williams discovered she was pregnant again and a scan at nine weeks 
revealed that she was expecting twins.

And
 there was more good news when the couple returned for a scan a month 
later, and discovered they were actually expecting identical triplets.

Mrs Williams said: 'it took a few days for the news to sink in and although I would not change it for the world, it was a bit of a shock.'

Waiting: Mrs Williams - currently 23 weeks - will have a planned C-section several weeks earlier than her summer due date to avoid complications

The scan revealed that she was expecting three identical boys, who all share one placenta. This phenomenon only happens once in every 60,000 pregnancies involving twins and is even rarer for triplets.

The odds of producing identical triplets without fertility drugs range from one in a million to one in 100 million according to various experts, with the rarity making it difficult to calculate the exact frequency of such births.

Mrs Williams says she sufffered morning sickness for the first few months and also started craving Marmite.

'It was horrendous,' she said. 'I woke up at 6am and started feeling sick and it didn't stop until 1pm. I was sick all the time and I could not keep anything down, but as soon as I reached four months I was fine.'

She will have a planned C-section at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff several weeks earlier than her summer due date to avoid complications.

Mrs Williams, who is now 23 weeks pregnant, said: 'I am feeling quite nervous about it all. They will be tiny when they're born and they will have to stay in hospital for six to 10 weeks.'

She is already taking supplements and will be put on steroids at 26 weeks to help the babies' lungs develop.

The couple, who live in a two-bedroom flat, plan to move to a bigger house and have already started shopping for their new arrivals.

'I read an article about a mum who had triplets and she gets through up to 40 nappies a day, so we're stockpiling,' she added.

'I've had to order a pram from abroad because they don't make them big enough. You can only seem to buy them for twins and I can't push two separate prams. We need a bigger house, but I don't want to move too far away from my family.'
