City banking giants will rake in nearly £17million in fees from the flotation of Royal Mail, despite accusations yesterday of having failed the taxpayer.

Six top bankers were grilled by MPs on the Business Select Committee over whether they set too low a share price for the sell-off in October.

One senior Tory MP told them they had got it 'sizeably wrong.'

Sell-off: Ministers have come under fire for the sharp rise in the share price of Royal Mail since the privatisation last month

Grilling: (From left to right) John Mayne, Managing Director, UK Client Coverage at JP Morgan; Ben Storey, Head of UK Investment Banking and Broking at Citibank; James Robertson, managing director at UBS; Richard Cormack, managing director, Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets at Goldman Sachs; Gert Zonneveld, managing director, Co-Head of Research at Panmure Gordon and James Agnew, chairman of UK Corporate Broking, Deutsche Bank

Brian Binley said: 'I just wonder 
whether the taxpayer has the right to think that, for all the money you 
are paid, you weren't very clever at your job.'

However, around £12.7million has 
already been paid in fees to the seven banks involved in the 
privatisation. But MPs and unions said an extra 'discretionary' sum of 
£4.2million, which is due to be paid within the next few months, should 
be blocked.

Banks, such as UBS and Goldman Sachs,
decided to price Royal Mail shares at £3.30 each, but they instantly 
rocketed in value and have remained high ever since.

Last night, the shares closed at 
£5.50. The Government raised £1.7billion from the sale, but would have 
raised £2.9billion if the shares had been sold at last night's closing 
price.

Mr Binley said to the bankers: 'I'm 
hearing an awful lot of sales speak. I'm hearing an awful lot of stuff 
from you to tell us how wonderful you are... and what great expertise 
you have.

'You have all come together like you 
are a professional body to defend each other. Can I as a taxpayer assume
that all of this is the cult of the high priest?

'Meant to be exclusive, meant to keep 
other people out, meant to say that you are much better at your job than
you are, and you failed the taxpayer.'

The six banks at yesterday's hearing 
were UBS and Goldman Sachs, who advised the Government, and four banks, 
JP Morgan, Citibank, Deutsche and Panmure Gordon, who did not.

Last night, the Department for 
Business said no decision has been made about the extra payment. It will
be made by Vince Cable, the Business Secretary but not for several 
months.

The sale was hugely popular with both 
small shareholders and City investors. For example, City firms applied 
for more than 20 times the number of shares which were available.

UBS and Goldman Sachs bosses were challenged by MPs over their advice to sell Royal Mail shares at £3.30

Mr Binley told the bankers: 'I was in the business of selling beer years and years ago. Anybody can sell cheap beer.'

But Richard Cormack, managing director
of Goldman Sachs, one of the key banks involved in the sale, said: 'I 
think, in the  context, this was a well-executed transaction.'

It emerged yesterday that UBS had 
considered increasing the price at which the shares would be offered 
from £3.30 to £3.50 just days before the flotation.

But it decided the move was too risky, and advised Mr Cable against such a move, advice which he accepted.

On the first day of trading on Friday 11 October, the shares jumped instantly from £3.30 to £4.50.

William Bain, a Labour MP on the 
committee, asked the bankers whether they thought an extra £4.2million 
would be appropriate given the poor deal for the taxpayers.

He asked: 'Do you think that is a decision that taxpayers will be likely to accept with open arms?'

James Robertson, managing director of 
UBS, said: 'I think that is for the Secretary of State [Vince Cable] to 
decide. It is in his gift.'

After yesterday's  hearing, Billy 
Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers' Union, which 
represents postal workers, said: 'At the very least the institutions 
which advised the Government should not receive any further payments, 
which are discretionary.'

At the hearing, the bankers tried to 
lay the most blame for the low price of the shares on the CWU's threat 
of industrial action at the time of the sale.
