Product recall: The fault is understood to affect only a small proportion of the blue and pink dummies

Asda was forced to apologise to customers yesterday after recalling some of its dummies over a choking risk which emerged when one device came apart in a baby's mouth.

The supermarket giant, based in Leeds, West Yorkshire, identified a fault with the product and asked parents to return all two-packs of the Little Angels Cherry Soother to stores for a full refund.

The fault is understood to affect only a small proportion of the blue and pink dummies – which have the barcode 0505244962706 - purchased since October. The baby was unhurt, Asda said.

An Asda spokesman told MailOnline: 'We have sold 24,000 in total of that product and there were 3,000 in store left - but as soon as we got that one complaint they were withdrawn.'

Another spokesman said: 'We've only had one complaint, but one complaint is just one too many for us. It's really important that we reassure you that we're taking this very seriously.'

'The small fault that we've found is that the top of the soother has come away from the outer casing. No babies and no children have been hurt in any shape or form.'

Customers have been asked to either dispose of the products or return them to an Asda store as a ‘precaution’, and the chain has advised people to get in contact if they need any further information.

A spokesman said: ‘When it comes to baby products, we don't take any chances, which is why even though there has only been one complaint, we chose to recall the product.

‘If customers have purchased an Asda Little Angels Cherry Soother two-pack, please dispose of it or take it back to your local Asda for a full refund. No receipt is necessary. We'd like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.’

No other Asda Little Angels soothers or dummies are said to have been affected.

Asda, which is part of the US retail giant Walmart, has more than 500 stores across the UK and sells more than 40,000 different products.
