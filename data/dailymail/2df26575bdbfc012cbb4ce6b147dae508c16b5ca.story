It was more than two years ago that Roberto Curti died after a chase and violent struggle with police that saw him tasered multiple times, doused with capsicum spray and knelt on.

Following an inquest into his death and a lengthy local court hearing into the matter, Senior Constable Damian John Ralph was the only officer out of three cops to be found guilty of his assault on Tuesday.

Shortly after handing down this decision, Magistrate Claire Farnan placed him on a two-year good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded.

Curti, who was living with his sister in Sydney while he studied English, had initially been pursued by officers after stealing two packet of cookies from a convenience store

Ralph's lawyer Roy Hood told the court the serving officer, who has been on restricted duties since December 2013, had been a 'troubled soul' since Mr Curti's death.

In finding Ralph guilty of assault on Tuesday, Ms Farnan said the senior constable had used at least two cans of capsicum spray on Mr Curti.

It was deployed within 15cm of the 21-year-old's face, while he was lying stomach down and being knelt on by other officers. It is also believed that Curti was tasered by police three times

Curti had initially been pursued by officers in the early hours of March 18, 2012, after stealing two packet of cookies from a convenience store on King St. 

Police chased him onto Pitt Street, before attempting to subdue him with the taser guns and capsicum spray.

Ms Farnan said 'while I accept in the heat of the moment he (Ralph) may have thought it was appropriate ... it's obvious it was not,'.

But she found Ralph was a man of good character, who was unlikely to reoffend and suffered from post-traumatic stress as a result of the incident.

Ralph and his colleague Chin Aun Lim, were charged with Mr Curti's assault

Ralph, along with his colleague Chin Aun Lim, were charged with Mr Curti's assault, while fellow officers Scott James Edmondson and Daniel David Barling were charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The court heard Mr Curti, who was living with his sister in Sydney while he studied English, became increasingly afraid after taking the drug LSD before his death.

When he stole the biscuits, it was incorrectly reported as an armed robbery involving two men. Mr Curti was later spotted by police, shirtless and without shoes.

He was tackled twice by police on Pitt Street before being brought to the ground on the third attempt.

He died at the scene.
