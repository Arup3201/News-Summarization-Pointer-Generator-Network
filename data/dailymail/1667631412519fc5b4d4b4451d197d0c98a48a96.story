It is often said that faith can move mountains, but when it comes to buildings, it appears that manpower will do.

A group of 80 men, reportedly from a local Amish community in Pennsylvania, were filmed moving a house into place without any help from machines.

After building the structure in a separate spot, dozens of men grabbed hold from the inside to move the house into place on the foundation.

The five-minute clip was filmed in Spartansburg, Pennsylvania, an area with just over 300 people and surrounded by several Amish communities.

It is unclear how this was filmed, with several people taking credit for the YouTube clip, as Amish rarely allow cameras and pictures being taken.

All for one: Dozens of Amish men lift the house from inside, turning in the structure into a gigantic caterpillar

Here we go: 80 men got together to help move the family home into place on the foundation

Heave ho! The five minute video sees the Amish slowly move the house by hand so as not to involve modern technology

The feet of the many helpers can be seen as they lift the house higher to get it onto the foundation in the village in Pennsylvania

Pivot! One step at a time, the group of men turn the house on the spot

Nearly there: A handful of men walk on the outside of the structure to guide the others who lift as one man from the inside of the house

Just a bit to the left: The final struggle is a slow one, as the group have to fine tune turning on the spot

Still a bit to go: The men put the house down for a few moments to discuss how to get it the right way round

Just need to move in: A few minutes after they began their journey, them men have successfully moved the house in place
