Wake Up host James Mathison apologised on TV on Thursday after the show set up a segment with pensioner Vilma Ward and Prime Minister Tony Abbott without disclosing her strong ties to the Labor Party.

The 85-year-old gave Mr Abbott a massive serve about his government's budget on morning show Wake Up on Wednesday.

But after Ms Ward's segment went viral it emerged she is a former ALP member and friend of Kevin Rudd and was selected by the show's producers.

'A set of circumstances came about that meant that the perception might be that Vilma was set up to ambush Tony Abbott but that was never our intent and if that's the perception then we do apologise for that,' Mr Mathison said.

'Honesty and integrity are really important to [co-host] Natarsha [Belling] and I and we would never be involved in something that would be so deliberate and callous.'

A Network Ten spokeswoman said producers were not aware of her links to the ALP before the show on Wednesday.

'Network Ten has reviewed the Wake Up segment in question,' she said.

'Wake Up should have known and disclosed Vilma Ward's links to the Labor Party.'

Vilma Ward, 85, volunteered for Kevin Rudd's campaign the first time he ran for the seat of Griffith

Ms Ward appeared on the show again on Thursday and she said she was proud of working for Kevin Rudd but denied being a 'ALP stooge'.

'I really don’t know what my political feelings have got to do with me as an 85-year-old pensioner asking our prime minister questions,' she said.

'Is he such a delicate little flower that he can't answer these questions?

'For heaven's sake, if the prime minister can't take a little bit of criticism from an 85-year-old pensioner, God help us.'

Ms Ward, from Norman Park in Kevin Rudd's former seat of Griffith, told MailOnline she had ties to the Labor party but said she was not an 'ALP plant'.

'Yes my husband [Leonard Edward] was the secretary of the Transport Workers Union,' she said.

'Yes I worked with Kevin Rudd on his very first campaign committee when he was standing for the seat of Griffith.

Ms Ward attacked Tony Abbott and his changes to the pension on Network Ten's Wake Up on Wednesday morning

'Yes I was a member of the Labor party then but I have a mind of my own and if I think black is black then black is black.'

Wake Up executive producer Steve Wood told MailOnline on Wednesday that Ms Ward was selected by a Brisbane-based producer who remembered her from a segment she did for Channel Nine a decade ago.

'She was picked because she's good talent, not because of her political bias but because she's good talent,' he said.

'Because we knew she's a pensioner and we also knew she'd be good talent.'

Mr Wood said Wake Up did not know she was a Labor voter when she was selected.

But Network Ten publicist Heidi Packer said Ms Ward was selected to appear in the budget segment along with a family and a couple, and that the three groups were chosen because they were either Labor, Liberal or swing voters, to represent different sections of the voting public.

The pensioner, from Norman Park in Brisbane, challenged the PM to visit pensioners and called him a 'comedian'

Each group asked the Prime Minister a question live on air.

'We didn’t mention on air who they voted for,' she said.

'But we did interview them off air… we wanted it to be fair.

'The only reason why that [Vilma] clip went out was because it was the most heated.'

Mr Wood said he had heard Mr Abbott’s office felt 'ambushed' by the segment but he disagreed.

'We look at it as being not an Opposition question but as a pensioner question.

'If the PM can't handle questions from a pensioner then he's got problems.

'Really if you look at it, he got in to power saying there would be no taxes, we get a person on today who said really at the end of the day "You lied".

'He's worried about what we do to him, what about what he's done to us.'

'At the end of the day all we’re after is good television and we got it.'

Ms Ward said Mr Abbott's comments about government expenses made her 'cranky'.

'I'm one of these people, if I think people are talking garbage I will tell them,' she said.

'I don't know why we tend to put politicians on pedestals.

'They're accountable, they're workers, we put them there to do a job for us and as far as I'm concerned they'll damn well do it.'

Mr Abbott was left momentarily speechless on live television on Wednesday morning after Ms Ward slammed him for the government's planned changes to the pension.

'Mr Prime Minster I have never heard of such rubbish in all my life,' Ms Ward told the PM on Network Ten's Wake Up.

Mr Abbott, pictured in Canberra on Wednesday, was left stunned for a moment on TV when Ms Ward slammed his budget

'Why don't you leave pensioners alone. If you pull the belt any tighter we'll choke to death.'

Mr Abbott was left stunned for a moment, before telling Ms Ward: 'Well Vilma you've just given me a piece of your mind, and fair enough.

'That's your right in a democracy to be able to tell the prime minister exactly what you think of him.'

In a statement to the MailOnline a spokeswoman for Mr Abbott said: 'The Prime Minister believes each Australian has the right in a democracy to be able to express exactly what they think of their politicians.

'The Prime Minister said during the interview that he suspected Ms Ward didn't vote for the Coalition during the election and said if she didn’t want to vote for the Coalition next time, that would be her right.

Treasurer Joe Hockey delivered his first budget in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday night

'The Prime Minister welcomes democratic debate and is always happy to engage in conversation.'

The coalition has stuck to its pledge not to change the age pension in this term of government, but big changes are planned from 2017.

Treasurer Joe Hockey insists the government is not cutting pension payments - they're just not going to increase as quickly as they do now.

From late-2017 the indexed increases to the age pension will be linked to the consumer price index instead of the highest rate available, generally male average earnings.

With inflation running at about 2.5 per cent pensioners will find their payments increasing by less than they've been used to in recent times.
