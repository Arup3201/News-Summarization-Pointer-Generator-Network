 

Harry Redknapp has been gainfully involved in football management for more than 30 years. 

His successes have been few but his employment has been regular. This is because he understands how the game works. In particular, he understands the art of self-preservation.

His performance after QPR’s latest defeat was taken straight from the play-book he helped to write. 

QPR are a desperately poor side and two years of Harry’s stewardship has not improved them.

They were unfortunate to lose to Liverpool but the reality is that they are bottom of the Premier League with just four points from 24.

It was time for a desperate manager to seek a diversion and Redknapp found it in an innocent query about his non-selection of Adel Taarabt. The resulting rant deserves to be enshrined in Gothic script.

‘I can’t protect people who don’t want to run and train and are about three stone overweight,’ declared Redknapp. 

‘Taarabt’s not injured. He’s not fit to play football, unfortunately. What am I supposed to keep saying? Keep getting your £60,000, £70,000 and don’t train? What’s the game coming to?’

There was more in that populist vein but we sensed, not for the first time, that reality might shortly raise its voice. And Taarabt’s response was devastating. Far from being ‘three stone overweight,’ he was athletically trim. He stepped on the scales and posed for pictures to make his point.

He also added a fascinating insight into Redknapp’s managerial methods: ‘He spends most of the time in his office but, when he gets off the phone, he comes down to watch for five or 10 minutes — he never takes a session. The training sessions aren’t the same standard as Milan, or what I would expect under another manager.’

Now if you were seeking a standard bearer for the ideal professional, then the unpredictable Adel Taarabt may not be your man. But he does not deserve to have his reputation spitefully smeared by a panicking manager.

By now, Redknapp was pinned to the ropes, yet managed to prattle: ‘The only reason he has lost weight is because he has had tonsillitis — even I could suck my stomach in for a picture and look OK’.

Tonsillitis! Even by Harry’s standards, it was preposterous. Either he had discovered the ultimate slimming aid, or he had been caught out in a fantasy. Judging by the derisive laughter, the public had made up its mind. QPR chairman Tony Fernandes apologised to fans for the ‘embarrassment’ caused by the ludicrous spat and spoke of his ‘disappointment’ with both manager and player.

And we sensed that Fernandes may have found the episode strangely revealing. As the entrepreneurial driving force behind the successful AirAsia budget airline, he clearly has some awareness of the importance of tranquil relationships between employer and employees. Certainly, he will not have been familiar with the 19th-century approach to industrial relations which English football has unthinkingly embraced.

Ever since Redknapp came into the game, more than half a century ago, he has learned to regard the manager as the ultimate autocrat. His word is law, his authority is absolute. Privately, a player may think him wrong, foolish or simply incompetent, but such thoughts are never voiced. For he is the manager, the ‘boss’, the ‘gaffer’, ordained by custom and practice. And if that gaffer should decide to hurl a few public insults at a player who may have displeased him, well, that is his God-given right.

Those employees are rather better rewarded these days; ‘£60,000, £70,000’, as Redknapp resentfully revealed. But the essential relationship is unchanged; they are still expected to doff their metaphorical cloth caps to the mill-owner, who can make or break them with a single, vengeful phrase. And they are expected to accept this Dickensian code without a whisper of protest.

In truth, it is a feudal system which demeans the players and deludes the managers. But football at large has known no other way and managers like Redknapp are patently content with that situation.

Redknapp's style subscribes to an outdated Dickensian management model that demeans players

Mercifully, the worm is starting to turn. The players’ sense of self respect is beginning to match their professional status. The Taarabt case is a poor example, since he has no future with QPR and therefore has little to lose. But other, more reflective, footballers increasingly deplore a system which demands such archaic deference.

It is said that, in the closing years of his time at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson was steadily moving away from the old methods. Tea cups no longer flew, boots were no longer kicked and the hair-dryer was returned to its case.

Players, in particular foreign players, were not prepared to be routinely insulted in that fashion. And Ferguson was a brilliantly talented, overwhelmingly successful football manager.

If stars such as Ferguson could see the way the game was changing, then functionaries like Redknapp have no excuse for their insulting ignorance. ‘What’s the game coming to?’, he blustered. Perhaps it is time that somebody told him...

How did Rodgers think he’d tame a £16m turkey?

It is a truth universally acknowledged that football managers know more about the game than football fans. 

It is just possible that some managers may know even more about the game than football writers. 

So how on earth can an enormously accomplished manager like Brendan Rodgers make the kind of error that comes complete with neon lights and a government health warning?

Brendan Rodgers is an astute and accomplished manager, but then he signed £16m turkey Mario Balotelli...

The list of Mario Balotelli’s misdemeanours would fill a charge sheet. Managers of the stature of Jose Mourinho and Roberto Mancini repeatedly tried and ultimately failed to harness his fitful talent, Mourinho declaring him ‘unmanageable’.

And yet, just a week before the close of the last transfer window, Rodgers convinced himself that he could handle the player. So he handed Milan £16million, and bought himself a turkey.

Now in the real world, £16m is regarded as rather a lot of money. But in the Neverland of the Premier League, it may be seen as no more than a punt, a throw of the dice.

Balotelli, during another bad day out for Liverpool against Hull on Saturday, has been dubbed 'unmanageable'

If Balotelli comes off, it’s a coup. If not, well, we can always move him on.

And yet, when the signing was made, there was something in Rodgers’ remarks which hinted at uncertainty.

‘I do not have any concerns,’ he said. ‘He comes in with a reputation but we hope we can curb that behaviour… He knows his flaws … It is a calculated risk but I hope we can improve him as a player and mature him as a young man. We think he can do very well for us.’

When Liverpool went three goals down to Real Madrid the other evening, the coldly disdainful reaction of Balotelli’s colleagues told us precisely how well the experiment was going.

He wore his indolence like a uniform, and that pantomime piece of shirt-swapping at half-time told us just how much he cared.

So abject was his performance that, in his club’s biggest match of the season so far, he could not be risked for the second half.

Obviously, Balotelli is not the only reason for the current problems at Anfield. But he was the avoidable error, the misguided hunch, the £16m mistake which should never have been made.

We are not wise after the event, because everyone from fans to scribblers to the dogs in the street sensed it when he was signed. Yet Brendan Rodgers went ahead with the deal. And now he must cope with the consequences.

Disturbing news from deepest Devon, where Gilbert the Gull, the Torquay United mascot, is accused of calling his own club supporters ‘a bunch of c****’ and challenging them to a fight. 

The distressing incident took place at Plainmoor last weekend. Gilbert, aka Steve Jegat, denies the charges, which the club describe as ‘an exchange of views’.

I’ve often wondered what impels people to dress as a teddy bear, an octopus, or even a seagull, in order to watch football on Saturday afternoons. 

Do they take the bus? Do they pay full fare? And those fans whom Gilbert allegedly insulted: how did they feel when they got home? ‘Nice day at the football, dear?’ ‘Not really. Some foul-mouthed seagull tried to pick a fight. And we got beat. By Grimsby. What’s for tea?’
