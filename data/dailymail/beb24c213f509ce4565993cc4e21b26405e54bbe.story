Yaya Sanogo may not have scored a competitive goal for Arsenal, but he insists he is ready to overcome another hurdle life has thrown his way.

The French striker, 21, was signed from Auxerre last summer on a free transfer and says he was 'living and playing in the streets' three years ago.

Sanogo played local football around the Paris suburbs before  finessing his technique in Ligue 2 as a scholar at Auxerre - but has been criticised by fans after some unconvincing displays in north London.

Yaya Sanogo has urged Arsenal fans to be patient with him and says he won't stop scoring once he nets once

And he says while the pressure does get to him after failing to net in 16 games, his work ethic will see him get on the scoresheet sooner rather than later - and he won't stop scoring afterwards.

'I feel the pressure but people should not forget that, three years ago, I was living in the streets,' he told Arsenal Player. 'Today I'm playing for Arsenal.

'When I joined Auxerre's training centre I knew I wanted to become a footballer and I told myself I had to be the best player there. I had to sign that contract and, after being injured for two years, Arsenal found me.

'Goals will come as long as I keep working hard. I am always positive and usually when I start scoring I don't stop. I haven't set any targets yet, all I care about is that I play and improve my game.

'Of course people will pressurise me - sometimes I get good critics and sometimes they are unfair, but I am catching up slowly and I am confident my time will come.'

Meanwhile, Danny Welbeck has hit the ground running at Arsenal and has already netted four times

Sanogo has yet to feature for Arsenal since the arrival of Danny Welbeck from Manchester United, with the £16million striker hitting the ground running at Arsenal.

Time will tell whether Sanogo can do the same.
