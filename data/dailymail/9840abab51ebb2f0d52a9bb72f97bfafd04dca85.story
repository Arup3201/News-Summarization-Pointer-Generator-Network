Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and a woman who accused him of raping her at a Lake Tahoe hotel-casino in 2008 have reached a settlement, ending her civil suit against him.

Andrea McNulty, a former VIP hostess at Harrah’s Lake Tahoe casino hotel, accused the Super Bowl star of luring her into his penthouse suite and forcing her to have sex with him.

Neither Ms McNulty’s lawyers nor Roethlisberger’s would say if she received compensation as part of the settlement.

Over and done: Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger settled out of court with a woman who accused him of raping her in 2008

Compensation: VIP Harrah's hostess Andrea McNulty settled her claim but it is unclear whether she received money as part of the settlement

Ms McNulty, now 33, said the quarterback lured her into his room under false presence that he needed his television fixed.

Roethlisberger was in town at the time to play in a celebrity golf tournament, and denied the allegations.

The original lawsuit filed in 2009 sought a minimum of $440,000 in damages from the quarterback, at least $50,000 in damages from the Harrah's officials and an unspecified amount in punitive damages.

Ms McNulty said she never filed a criminal complaint because she feared Harrah's would side with Roethlisberger and she would be fired.

The Reno Gazette-Journal first reported the settlement on its website. 

It also dismisses claims against Harrah's employees whom the woman had accused of covering up the alleged sexual assault in Roethlisberger's penthouse suite in July 2008.

Ms McNulty’s lawyer Cal Dunlap first told Washoe District Court Judge Brent Adams in papers filed last November that his client wanted to have a stay lifted so the case could be dismissed because a settlement was pending.

‘All parties have reached a resolution of all claims and counterclaims,’ he wrote.

Mr Adams formally dismissed the case December  27 but neither side had publicized it until now.

David Cornwell, Roethlisberger's lawyer, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on Friday.

His agent, Ryan Tollner, said neither he nor Roethlisberger would have any comment.

The Nevada Supreme Court had ruled against the two-time Super Bowl champion quarterback's request in August to have the case moved from Reno to Carson City because it was closer to where the alleged incident had occurred at Harrah's in Stateline.

He faced similar claims in 2010 after a 20-year-old Georgia college student accused him of sexually assaulting her after a night of drinking at a bar.

Though Georgia authorities investigated the allegations, no charges were formally filed.
