A doctor who was the the first to climb the highest mountains on every continent has survived a  brain hemorrhage because of his hobby. 

Dr Alistair Sutcliffe is only alive because his body had become used to being starved of oxygen at heights of up to 30,000ft.

Being at such high altitudes had forced open an artery that normally closes down at birth. Had it not been open, he would have died.

After successfully summiting the seven highest mountains of the world, he was suddenly struck by the subarachnoid brain haemorrhage, and his family was told he would not survive.

But despite going into a coma as his body began to shut down, Dr Sutcliffe saved his own life in an extraordinary twist of fate.

The 49-year-old said: 'I suddenly felt an odd fast-creeping spasm over my lower neck.

'The neck pain moved swiftly to head pain and I began to fear I was having a brain haemorrhage.

'My vision was affected, most things appeared hazy, and I thought I was going to die.'

Dr Sutcliffe’s interest in mountain climbing began aged 11, when he met Chris Bonington - the first British person to successfully summit Mount Everest.

Within seven years, he made it to the top of Mont Blanc, Aconcagua, Vinson, Denali, Everest, Kilimanjaro, Elbrus and the Carstensz Pyramid, before facing his hardest climb to date - fighting for survival.

'From the minute I met Chris Bonington I was hooked,' he said. 'It made me want to know what it felt like to stand on top of the world and how people can get so high without being in a plane.

'I thought to myself, one day I want to answer those questions.

'I climbed Mont Blanc in France in 2002 and went on to climb the highest mountains in the world over the next five years.'

During his explorations around the world, Dr Sutcliffe, from Whitby, North Yorkshire, endured sub-zero temperatures, watched climbers fall to their death coming and was even held at gunpoint.

He said: 'It was now or never for Everest, but we picked the worst year for fatalities. Seventeen people died, and three of those were on a trek an hour ahead of us.

'It was actually the morning that we left an hour late or we would have been caught up with them.

'On another climb, we were taken hostage for 13 hours on a bus floor as raiders tried to extract as much money from us as possible.

'They would have shot us if we had tried to move, but we did what they said until they let us go.'

But his toughest challenge was yet to come, and it was thanks to his gruelling crusades to date that saved him from death.

'I had a brain haemorrhage which should have killed me, but a blood vessel opened which ultimately saved my life,' said Dr. Sutcliffe.

'Had it not been open, it would have just burst. Most people would have died within 20 minutes, but my brain had become used to coping with as little as 40 per cent oxygen.

“My brain had been stressed and the blood vessel reopened. Rather than the brain being cut off, it was directed to the areas that needed the blood and most of the functions regained.

'Altitude does odd things to the body. Oxygen deprivation occurs noticeably above six thousand feet, producing an aching in the muscle tissues and a streaming cold similar to a mild influenza.

“Exercising and breathing feels constrained, as if you have a plastic bag over your head, but in the long run these are the things that saved my life.

'If I had not been climbing, my brain would not have developed an extra vessel so I would have died.'

With a medical background, Dr Sutcliffe realised he was having a brain hamorrhage and called his surgeon wife Clare, 41.

After arriving at hospital, he called his parents to say goodbye before drifting into a coma.

Dr Sutcliffe said: 'I could hear the consultant and I could hear what was going on around me - they were telling my family I was going to die and discussing organ donation with Clare.

'They found out it was a tumour which usually ends in death, and when I awoke from the coma I lost my sight, which they said was likely never to return.

'Luckily after about six hours it did, but as I was recovering I was so worried about losing my memory and forgetting about my amazing experiences so I decided to write them down.'

Dr Sutcliffe has since written a book about his mountain climbing and the medical miracle that saved his life - titled The Hardest Climb.

He said: 'I have no idea how I got my medal, but I am incredibly honoured. Someone must have nominated me.

'It’s the medal that’s awarded to people that have done the stuff themselves. It’s a really nice one to have.

'I’ve been through some really amazing life changing events and it’s been great being part of these climbs.

'There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think I’m incredibly fortunate. I live with that in the knowledge that I’m still here.

'The reason I’m still alive is because I know when to stop.'

As a result, his body had become used to being starved of oxygen

High altitudes had also forced open an artery that usually closes at birth
