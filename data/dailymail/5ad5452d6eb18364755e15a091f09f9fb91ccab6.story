If you look on Google Maps satellite views of Vancouver you'll be surprised to see that it has more leaning towers than Pisa.

The 3D isometric views of the city on Canada's east coast appear to show many of its high-rise buildings looking rather is if they are about to topple over.

The glitch was pointed out by Henry Reich (@minutephysics) on Twitter this morning. He asked: 'Was Google Maps Vancouver designed by Dali?'

Askew: Salvador Dali was a prominent Spanish surrealist painter in many of whose artworks the normal laws of physics did not seem to apply

The prominent Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dali was well known for fantastic artworks, in which the normal laws of physics don't seem to apply.

The same could be said for Google's rendering of downtown Vancouver, where many of the buildings appear to defying gravity by leaning at odd angles relative to each other.

The phenomenon appears to be a glitch in Google Maps' 45-degree view feature.

Comparison by MailOnline with other areas of high-rise development which are pictured with the view, including Detroit, Michigan, and Newcastle upon Tyne, shows the same glitch, but the effect is less obvious.

Google released the 45-degree view imagery in its map product last September, with the initial roll-out featuring 51 cities with the feature.

It was a response to the Flyover feature in Apple's iOS 6 Maps app, which was slammed by users for its bizarre rendering of many areas.

Detroit, Michigan: The same effect can be seen in the Midwest U.S. city to a lesser extent

Among the landmarks touted by Google at the release of the 45 degree view was the world-famous Leaning Tower of Pisa, a free-standing bell tower which has been actually tilting since before it was even finished.

The tilt is due to its construction on an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to support the tower's weight.

Google Maps satellite images are not updated in real time and in most cases they are several months or years old.

Although Google uses the word satellite, most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800â€“1500ft.
