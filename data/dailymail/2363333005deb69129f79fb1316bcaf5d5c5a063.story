An estate agents has been forced to change its name from ISIS Residential Homes to distance itself from the terrorist group in Syria. 

The company, created 10 years ago, was named after the Egyptian goddess of family, by its founders. 

However after the emergence of the barbaric extremist group in the Middle East, bosses have decided to rename the business.

It comes after a Belgian chocolate company of the same name was forced to rebrand and campaigners suggested a dog in Downton Abbey be renamed to avoid confusion.

Steven Harvey, Managing director of the estate agents in Staines, Surrey, said: 'We, like most, have watched the actions of Islamic State in the Middle East unfold with shock and revulsion.

'As a company which regrettably shares a historic term of reference with this group, the public connection, however tenuous, has caused us much anguish.

Managing Director Steven Harvey said the company was revolted by the extremist group

'Fortunately, as a long established local brand our business has not suffered any noticeable impact.' 

The business will now be known as Oasis Residential Homes, and is moving to a larger premises next year. 

In April last year when the terrorist organisation first became known, the estate agents decided against changing its name. 

But as time went on and further atrocities were committed by the group, bosses felt compelled to take action.  

'It is because of our success and support locally that we felt confident enough to weather the media storm, especially as ISIS as a definition has been superseded by IS and ISIL in April 2013," said Mr Harvey.

'As the actions of ISIS become ever more desperate, ignoring the association in the hope that the media moves on is no longer an option, regardless of our personal sentiments.

'While we had no intention of changing our name, a natural stage in our business life cycle affords us the opportunity to adjust our name as part of our planned expansion.

Twitter users suggested Isis the dog in Downton Abbey should be killed off to avoid association with terrorists. He appeared sickly in a recent episode of the ITV show (pictured)

'While the journey in reaching this decision has been a distracting one, now we are here we know it is the right decision and it enables us to concentrate on what we do best - selling and letting homes.' 

It comes after a Belgian chocolate company was forced to change its name following confusion with the branch of terrorists. 

Italo Suisse renamed itself Isis after a new line of pralines and tablets. The company was forced to change its name to Libeert following public upset. 

The Grantham family's pet Labrador in Downton Abbey also came under fire, with Twitter users suggesting the animal be killed off to avoid any association with extremists. 

An Australian couple were also urged to consider finding a renaming their eight-year-old daughter earlier this year in light of the group's activity.
