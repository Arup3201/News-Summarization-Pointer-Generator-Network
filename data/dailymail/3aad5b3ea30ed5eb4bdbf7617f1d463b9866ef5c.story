An angry passenger who couldn’t find his bag after getting off a plane wound up attacking an airline employee who asked to see his checked-luggage ticket.

Port Authority police say the passenger beat the United Airlines employee in front of shocked travellers inside a terminal at LaGuardia Airport in New York.

The employee was repeatedly punched in the face and kicked multiple times once he fell to the floor.
