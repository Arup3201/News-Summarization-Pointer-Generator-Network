A former Deutsche Bank executive has been found dead at a house in London, it emerged today.

The body of William ‘Bill’ Broeksmit, 58, was discovered at his home in South Kensington on Sunday shortly after midday by police, who had been called to reports of a man found hanging at a house.

Mr Broeksmit - who retired last February - was a former senior manager with close ties to co-chief executive Anshu Jain. Metropolitan Police officers said his death was non-suspicious.

Mr Jain and co-chief executive Juergen
 Fitschen said in an internal memo: ‘He was considered by many of his 
peers to be among the finest minds in the fields of risk and capital 
management.'

They added: ‘We are deeply 
saddened by Bill's death. He was a dear friend and colleague to many of 
us who benefitted from his intellect and wisdom.

‘Our
 thoughts and condolences are with his wife and family at this time. We 
will remember him for his contributions to Deutsche Bank, thoughtful 
advice and personal friendship.’

Mr
 Broeksmit worked in investment banking - specifically risk and 
securities - and lived on exclusive Evelyn Gardens in South Kensington, 
which has an average property value of £1.9million.

He is also registered to a high-value property a stone's throw from New York's Central Park.

Mr
 Broeksmit's name appears on U.S. government records for the Broeksmit 
Family Foundation, which is based in the palatial 1185 Park Avenue building.

The three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment to which he is linked was worth $4,500,000 when it was last sold in June 2000.

A banker has died after jumping 500ft from the top of JP Morgan's headquarters in London.

The man, who is believed to be aged 39, fell from the 33-floor skyscraper and was found this morning on the ninth-floor roof of the building in Canary Wharf, east London.

JP Morgan refused to say what role the man had, although a source said he was a banker.

He worked at Deutsche Bank from 1996 to 2001, then from 2008 until he retired. Mr Broeksmit was also employed by Merrill Lynch for a period.

Mr Broeksmit was one of around 100 bankers who left Merrill Lynch for Deutsche when its investment banking arm was founded in the 1990s.

He was involved in the process of rescuing the bank in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when many investment banks found their debts were 'toxic', and unlikely ever to be repaid.

Mr Broeksmit, a renowned risk expert, assisted the bank's efforts to shift the worst of the debt, and reduce its total amount of lending.

Chiefs at Deutsche Bank had planned to promote Mr Broeksmit to its management board in 2012, but stopped when the German financial regulator expressed doubts about his experience as a leader.

Scotland
 Yard confirmed only that a 58-year-old man was found hanged. A spokesman 
said: ‘Police were called at 12.35pm on Sunday to a man found hanging at
 Evelyn Gardens, SW7.

‘Kensington
 and Chelsea police, ambulance and air ambulance all attended. A 
58-year-old man was declared dead at the scene. The death is being 
treated as non-suspicious.’
