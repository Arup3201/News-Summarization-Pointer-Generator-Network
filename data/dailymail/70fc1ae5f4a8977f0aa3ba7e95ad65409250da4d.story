It was the setting for many a wild party, even attracting the likes of President John F Kennedy, screen siren Marilyn Monroe and avant garde artist Andy Warhol.

Now the Manhattan penthouse once belonging to crooner Frank SInatra can be yours - for a cool $7.7million.

The sprawling 3,000 sq ft apartment - on New York's East 72nd street, is to go on sale - and it's in need of a little bit of tender loving care, it has been reported.

Ol' Blue Eyes: Sinatra's old penthouse needs modernisation, but it's still set for someone with that Rat Pack mentality

Jason Haber, a broker for the  told 
the New York Post: 'The apartment has been modernised, but it is still 
set up for someone with that Rat Pack mentality.

'It is really for someone who wants to entertain, to have people over, to have dinner parties.'

The
apartment was once called the 'glittering grotto in the sky' by Andy 
Warhol and it was the setting for many a swinging soiree.

After
divorcing second wife Ava Gardner in 1957, Sinatra snapped up the 
duplex, which occupied the 22nd and 23rd floors, and the space was 
transformed into a four-bedroom, six-bathroom apartment worthy of the 
Rat Pack.

Construction was completed in 1961.

Arguably
the jewel in the penthouse's crown was a glassed-in, rooftop party room
where guests would mingle under 18-foot ceilings and enjoy sweeping 
views of the East River.

His star-studded guestlist often included fellow Rat Packers Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop. It is even claimed that Davis use to enjoy throwing champagne glasses from the terrace.

One party included appearances from President John F Kennedy, Hollywood siren Marilyn Monroe and avant garde artist Andy Warhol.

He also used the large party space to work on his vocals when he wasn't entertaining, Haber added.

The singer sold the apartment in 1972 to his personal physician, celebrity doctor Denton Cox, whose other clients included Judy Garland and Warhol.

When Cox died his estate was sold to insurance magnate Penny Hart in 2008 for $4.5million. Because Cox had done very little to maintain the penthouse, Hart made many renovations and turned a section of Sinatra's legendary party space into the master bedroom.
