Over 100 passengers including students and teachers, were feared drowned last night after a ferry carrying as many as 350 sank off the coast of Papua New Guinea.

Australian Maritime Safety Authority have confirmed that 230 survivors have been rescued so far after the MV Rabaul Queen went down while travelling from Kimbe on the island of New Britain to the coastal town of Lae on the main island.

A Star Ships spokesman told AFP that 'bad weather' was believed to have sunk the ship.

The ferry sent out a distress 
signal but went down shortly after.

A plane from Australia, three helicopters and six ships were scouring the search area after the ship's distress signal was detected by the Australian maritime agency.

Papua New Guinea's rescue coordinator Captain Nurur Rahman said four merchant ships had been immediately diverted to the scene to help with the rescue.

He told the BBC he had reports of people floating in life jackets where the boat sank.

A Star Ships spokesman told AFP that 'bad weather' was believed to have sunk the ship.

Tragic: The incident happened when the ferry was travelling between two different parts of Papua New Guinea

Australian prime minister Julia Gillard said there were 350 people aboard and that Australia was providing assistance to its near neighbour.

Tragic: Australian prime minister said there was a 'likely very high loss of life' after the ferry sank

'This is obviously a major tragedy,' she told reporters in Melbourne.

'Given the likely very high loss of 
life here, I think when this news comes to the attention of Australians 
around the country they will be thinking about the people of PNG as they
respond to this tragedy.'

Reports after the incident did not 
confirm how the ship had managed to sink, although overcrowding on boats
in Papua New Guinea has previously seen them capsize in similar 
situations.

The Australian Maritime Safety 
Authority said the Rabaul Queen had gone down about 10 miles off the 
coast of Finschhafen, some 50 miles from its final destination of Lae.

The ferry's operator, Rabaul Shipping, said it had lost contact with the vessel in the early hours of the morning.

Police in Kimbe said most of the passengers were students and trainee teachers.

Foreign embassies are trying to establish if any of their nationals were on board - Kimbe is a popular dive site that attracts tourists from around the world.

It was the second major disaster to hit the country, which lies to the north of Australia, in less than two weeks following a landslide in the central highlands which wiped out an entire village, killing around 60 people.

It said 350 people were believed to be on board, but Papua New Guinea's National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA) rescue co-ordinator Captain Nurur Rahman said the true figure was likely lower.

'I cannot confirm or deny the 350 missing number. It is hearsay,'

Rahman said. 'I have not seen the manifest as yet, but it is likely around 300.

Rahman said he was being fed information from an NMSA agent on board one of the ships.

'The dynamics of this thing are changing all the time, minute by minute,' he said.

Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said he has spoken to his Papua New Guinea counterpart to offer assistance.'Our hearts go out to those affected by the sinking,' Mr. Rudd said in a statement.'Â
