Jermain Defoe was left to eat humble pie after frontman Gilberto proved just why he should be Toronto's free-kick taker against New York Red Bulls on Friday night.

The former Tottenham striker argued with the Brazilian after the MLS side were awarded a set-piece just outside the area.

However, Defoe, who had even whacked the ball out of Gilberto's grasp during the heated exchange, had to watch on as his fellow attacker unleashed a thunderous shot into the roof of the net which left the goalkeeper with no chance.

Gilberto, clearly glad to have proved his point, ran straight to the touchline to celebrate.

Defoe couldn't hide his amusement and laughed to himself as he raced over to congratulate his team-mate.

Having squabbled just a minute earlier, the pair were all smiles as they carried out a choreographed handshake before embracing on the pitch.

The Canadian side, managed by former Blackburn defender Ryan Nelsen, let victory slip in the dying embers of the game as the league's top scorer Bradley Wright-Phillips struck a late equaliser in the third minute of added time to seal a 2-2 draw.

Tim Cahill, who came on after 78 minutes following having returned from Brazil after representing Australia at the World Cup, set up the dramatic finish by flicking a header towards the six-yard box as Wright-Phillips' slotted the ball past goalkeeper Joe Bendik.Â 

New York had opened the scoring when Peguy Luyindula headed home Ambroise Oyongo Bitolo's cross on 36 minutes before Defoe levelled the scores with a clever finish early in the second half.
