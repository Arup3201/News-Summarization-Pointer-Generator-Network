A sprawling waterfront Greenwich, Connecticut estate sold for an astonishing $120 million on Friday, the largest sum ever paid for a home in America.

That means its 12 bedrooms come in at $10 million each, but the anonymous buyer also gets two of his or her own islands in the Long Island Sound to sweeten the deal.

The 13,000-square-foot mansion called Copper Beech Farm also features a 75-foot pool, grass tennis court and stone carriage house.

$10M per bedroom: A 12-bedroom Greenwich mansion sold Friday for the record-breaking sum of $120 million--apparently enough dough to buy palm trees even in chilly Connecticut

Posh: The 50-acre waterfront estate features a 75-foot pool, two islands in Long Island Sound, a stone carriage house and a grass tennis court

Seaside: The home once belonged to Andrew Carnegie's niece and originally listed last May for an even more jaw-dropping $190 million

While it's original listing price was 
an even more astonishing $190 million, real estate agent David Ogilvy 
tells the Greenwich Time he believes the sum is the most ever paid for a
 residential property in the United States.

'I'll
 tell you a secret,' he said after the historic closing Friday. 'This is
 also the most expensive property sold in America. The 
next-most-expensive sold for $117 million in California.'

That 9-acre Silicon Valley estate featuring an 8,900-square-foot mansion sold in January 2013.

Copper Beech Farm was built in 1896 and was once owned by Andrew Carnegie's niece Harriet Lauder Greenway.

Like many homes in tony Greenwich, Copper Beech was purchased through a limited liability corporation to protect the privacy of its new owner.

Ogilvy would say only that the buyer is not local.

According to a July 2013 New York Times
 report, the $120 million selling price is actually less than the 
mountains of mortgages previous owner John Rudey had on the property.

Mr Rudey owns timber companies, and when some of his lands ran into problems producing timber, Copper Beech suffered.

Mr Rudey bought the property with his
 wife Laurie in 1982 for 7.55million and took out mortgages every so often to
 finance the estate.

But in 2006 the amounts drastically shot up.

Mrs
 Rudey took out a $59 million mortgage on the estate in 2006 with Bank 
of America, and the loan was personally guaranteed by both Rudeys.

Before that mortgage, there was already a $41 million mortgage with M&T Bank.

It was around this time that Mr Rudey's timber companies started to hit hot water.

Estate: Much of the home's value is in the fifty acres of land and more than a mile of waterfront property

Staff quarters: The main kitchen is located in the basement - an inconvenience for modern families who might want to cook for themselves

Luxury lifestyle: Other amenities include a heated pool, tennis court, solarium and a formal garden

At
 the start of the 2000s one of Mr Rudey's companies purchased $60 million
 in forest land in Kittias County, Washington, but the area ended up not
 producing much timber because of the presence of the endangered Spotted
 Owl and an infestation of spruce budworm.

The area has become a popular second-home destination, but plans to develop the area into neighborhoods never happened.

In 2006 Mr Rudey was hit with another obstacle - one of his companies in Oregon went bankrupt.

At
 the end of 2010 the Rudey family's $59 million mortgage on a part of 
Copper Beech was cross-collateralized with a $79 million mortgage on the 
Washington forestland, both with Bank of America.

If
 the Rudeys fell behind on payments it meant the bank could sell either 
property and if they came up short, the Rudey's would be liable.

In
 addition to that mortgage, they had $65 million in mortgages on another 
part of Copper Beech through M&T Bank, bringing the total debt on 
the estate to $203 million.

Foreclosure
 proceedings on Bank of America's portion of Copper Beech started in 
2011, but the Rudey's filed a suit against the bank claiming 'predatory 
lending practices,' and the following summer the suits were dropped.

Fixer upper: The house was put on the market for a record-breaking $190million, but the interiors could do with an update

Lots of room: The house includes 15,000 feet of living space and 12 bedrooms

Proper garden: The land is maintained by a horticulturalist with the New York Botanical Garden

Privacy: The house is set back from the road and accessed by a 1,800 foot-long driveway
