Scottish patients on the waiting list for vital transplants could be sent to the back of the queue if the country votes for independence.

Department of Health officials today warned that the current system for treatment would have to be completely re-written in the event of a win for the Yes campaign.

This mean patients currently on the waiting list could face an even longer delay for life-saving heart, lung and liver transplants.

In a blow to Alex Salmond, the UK Government today warned Scottish patients on the waiting list for vital transplants could be sent to the back of the queue if Scotland votes Yes

Scottish patients are currently matched with any suitable organ available from anywhere in the UK, but the borders could have to be re-drawn if Scotland goes independent, reports The Times.

A UK Government spokesman said: 'Scottish residents receive treatments in England including for a range of specialised services such as heart, lung and liver transplant procedures.

'It cannot be assumed that all existing arrangements between the Scottish NHS and the NHS in other parts of the UK would necessarily continue in their current form - for example, those whereby NHS Blood and Transplant allocates organs for transplant on a UK-wide basis.'

Scottish residents currently have access to more than 40 specialist treatments in England for rare conditions.

There are currently more than 500 Scottish patients awaiting a transplant. 

The future of the NHS has been one of the central issues to the debate over independence, with each side offering different visions for its future.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said this weekend that a Yes vote meant taking a 'risk' on the future of NHS services in Scotland

The Better Together campaign insists that funding from UK tax-payers is vital for the current level of service to be maintained, while the SNP dismiss this as scare-mongering and argue NHS services in Scotland as part of the UK would be vulnerable to cuts to services.

Labour leader Ed Miliband this weekend stressed the impact independence could have on the NHS during a Better Together rally in Edinburgh.

Mr Miliband claimed £1 billion could be slashed from its budget - the cost of employing 36,000 nurses - under independence.

He said Alex Salmond's 'lack of a currency plan' could lead to £21 billion of spending cuts in an independent Scotland, according to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.

The Labour leader said: 'Be in no doubt what this means: Over £1 billion a year would be the NHS's share of those cuts, the equivalent of 36,000 nurses. That is the real threat to NHS.

'When better, faster, safer change is coming, that's not a risk anyone who loves the NHS should take.'

Mr Miliband added: 'As we enter the last days of this campaign, the choice for the people of Scotland is clearer than ever before - change with No or huge risks with Yes.'
