Her Sports Illustrated cover may tell fans to 'Remember her name' - but Mo'ne Davis might be hoping they'll forget her performance in the Little League World Series semifinal game last night.

Just hours after it emerged that the Little League phenom had scored a coveted Sports Illustrated cover, the 13-year-old was pulled from the game during her team's 8-1 loss.

The Philadelphia teen gave up three runs and six hits against Las Vegas and one walk in 2 and 1/3 innings.

'Mo'ne didn't have her A game today,' Philly manager Alex Rice said after the loss. 'At this point, we're playing to get to Saturday.'

Disappointed: Mo'ne Davis  stands on the mound during the third inning of the game against Las Vegas on Wednesday night. Las Vegas won 8-1, with Mo'ne giving up three runs in 2 and 1/3 innings

Not too happy: Davis steps up to bat on Wednesday. She left the game after 55 pitches, meaning she cannot play in tonight's battle against Las Vegas but will play if they reach the championships on Saturday

The loss comes after she captivated the sports world when she pitched a no-hitter last Friday - a first for a girl at the Little League World Series. She is the 18th girl to appear in the tournament.

She has also become the first Little League player of either gender to score a Sports Illustrated cover - and Wednesday's performance puts her in good company.

Other sports stars, including New England Patriot Tom Brady, have also put in a bad performance following their appearances on the front of the magazine, ABC News pointed out.

But even though it wasn't her strongest performance, she still drew record audiences: the game earned the highest ever preliminary rating for the event on ESPN, the network said.

The game received a 3.4 overnight rating, up 143 per cent from the corresponding game last year. It also drew a 16.3 rating in Las Vegas and a 14.9 in Philadelphia.

Ratings represent the percentage of homes with televisions tuned to a program, and overnights measure the country's largest markets.

Mo'ne, whose pitch has been clocked at 70mph, only threw 55 pitches on Wednesday night so she will be eligible to pitch on Saturday if her team advances to the U.S. championship game. 

Honor: The disappointing performance came after it was announced that she will become the first Little Leaguer - of either gender - to ever grace the cover of Sports Illustrated. It is due out August 25

Philly will take Chicago on again on Thursday, but she won't be pitching due to pitch-count rules.

Despite the disappointing result on Wednesday, Davis still put in a solid performance, the Associated Press reported.

She dazzled her opponents more than once on the mound with off-speed deliveries and tantalizing pitches just off the plate. 

'She's very crafty,' said opponent Austin Kryszczuk, who scored against her. 'She's a great pitcher. That triple in the first was huge and then she settled down. Great job by us to get this victory.'

The game came after she had eight strikeouts, didn't walk a batter and needed only 70 pitches to complete the game in the team's 4-0 victory over Nashville.

She then led Philadelphia to a 8-0 victory over Delaware in the Mid-Atlantic Regional championship game.

Mo'ne appears on the SI cover, with the headline 'Remember her name,' on the August 25 issue - not that fans, who have lined the grassy hills beyond the playing field at the Little World Series to see Davis play, really need to be told.

Impressed: Although Philadelphia took a bad loss, Las Vegas' Austin Kryszczuk (pictured on Wednesday) called her a 'great pitcher' and said his team did well to win. Kryszczuk hit a triple in the game

The concession stands have sold out of the powder-blue T-shirts of her Mid-Atlantic team. 

And yet, in spite of her 70 mph fastball, baseball isn't Davis' best game; her basketball coach said she is even better on the hardwood.

'Coaching boys and girls in this age group for two decades, Mo'ne is just a special talent,' said Debra Brady, Davis's basketball coach at Springside Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia.

'She's a phenomenal pitcher, but I think her best sport is basketball. In a year or so, she will be doing the same unbelievable things in basketball. The first couple of games I coached her, she was head and shoulders above any kid I've ever coached at that age level.'

Davis has not shied from using her riveting success in a positive way.

She sacrificed time with teammates to do a national television interview late Sunday night, and of course there's the Sports Illustrated cover.
