A driver who was trying to hide her identity from cops said that she was 22 and only looked older because she had a medical condition that made her age faster, according to a police report.

Jennifer Crosby, 43, was driving through Indian River County, Florida on a suspended license when she was pulled over by a police officer for broken tail lights.

When she was asked to hand over her license and other documents, she told the officer she had forgotten her purse, according to the police report shared by The Smoking Gun.

She then claimed her name was Christina Topp and that she had been born on March 16, 1992.

But the officer, Deputy Colby Smith, wrote in the report: 'Immediately I was suspicious because the driver appeared significantly older than that.'

She even gave a social security number that matched with the identity - but when the officer checked a database that showed a photo of Topp, it was clear the two women were not the same person.

In fact, the woman she had claimed to be was her daughter.

'She admitted that her name was Jennifer R. Crosby and she gave me her daughter’s name because her driver's license was suspended,' the report noted.

She was arrested for driving on a suspended license and providing a false name and booked into the county jail, where she remains on bond of $4,000.

The arrest comes just months after she was arrested for possession of crack cocaine, which she had hidden inside her vagina in a piece of foil.

When cops conducting a search asked her if she had any drugs on her person, she admitted that she had cocaine inside of her. 

But when she pulled them out, she screamed in pain and said: 'The foil is hurting the inside of my vagina', according to a police report.
