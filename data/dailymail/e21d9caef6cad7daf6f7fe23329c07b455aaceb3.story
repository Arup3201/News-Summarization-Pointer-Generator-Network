A fifteen-year-old girl was reduced to tears after receiving foul abuse from parents while refereeing an under-10's football match.

After a strong challenge went unpunished towards the end of a fixture between Platt Lane City, who have links to Manchester City and are based at the club's youth complex in Moss Side,  and Liverpool's Litherland Tigers, Emma Hickson was surrounded by raging parents who started swearing at and verbally abusing the teenager.

Football-mad Hickson, who plays as well as officiates, revealed that her confidence has been shattered by the incident and that she has been left fearful of continuing to referee.

Foul play: Emma Hickson describes the abuse she received from parents while refereeing as 'frightening'

Shock: Emma's father has revealed his anger at the treatment his daughter was subjected to

'I don't think I said there was swearing as such, but he did definitely call me a disgrace,' Hickson told Sportsmail. There were a few parents saying things like 'silly little b****', 't***' and things like that.

'At the end of the day, it is a kids football match. They just want to play football, I just want to ref and it shouldn't be taken that seriously. Hopefully, this will raise awareness of how much referee needs respect because people under-estimate how hard it is to be a referee until they actually take it up.'

'I've had the best support possible from Lancashire FA. We are currently working on it and have sent reports off. The people at the LFA are all behind me. They can concentrate a lot on protecting referees as well.'

'I think there was a Manchester/Liverpool rivalry at the play. I had walked off by that stage, when the parents were having a snap at each other. There was an element of that rivalry there.

Platt
Lane will now be the subject of an investigation by Manchester FA and, if it finds against the club, 
the punishment is expected to be severe as Hickson's young age makes 
this incident a breach of the safeguarding children code.

It’s sad but inevitable to hear her Dad speak of the advice he had given Emma, telling her to ‘expect a little bit of criticism, after all she is a referee’.The point is that the criticism and abuse of match officials is now so commonplace that it has become the accepted norm and all too often it goes unreported as local park refs take their lead from senior colleagues and ignore the abuse. ‘It comes with the territory’ seems the oft trodden path. I manage an Under 14 team and two seasons ago had to step in when an opposition parent harangued a young lady referee so much he made her cry – his team were allowed to play on and were merely warned as to their future conduct.In this case both teams were expelled from the tournament but all too often, no action is taken due to referees - understandably when alone and unprotected - decide that discretion is the better part of valour.Premier League referees have no such excuses; they just choose to ignore the excesses of the modern footballer and that sets the template for the game. 

The game took place at Whiteholme Playing Fields in Blackpool, during a tournament involving over 250 sides. Both clubs were sides were immediately expelled from the competition.

Litherland Tigers Chairman John Ellinson told the Manchester Evening News: 'We will be writing to the girl who was refereeing and her mother to apologise for what happened. Apparently it was something and nothing that turned into a Liverpool/Manchester thing with the two sets of parents. We will be carrying out our own internal review.'

However, Barry Macklin, the coach of Platt Lane City, has denied that the incident revolved around a Manchester/Liverpool rivalry.

He told the M.E.N.: 'There was no animosity between our parents and theirs and this was not a Manchester/Liverpool thing as they claimed.

'I noticed before the match that the parents of the kids on the other team were stood on the touchline when they should have been behind a white taped line as ours were.

'I asked the referee for clarification and she said it was OK. As I walked off I got a few comments and one of their parents called me "petty".'

He added: 'There were a few comments from the other side and it got a bit heated but there was no aggression from either set of parents and we certainly did not swear at the referee.

'She said the game was over and there was going to be penalties. I told her that she should have stopped it (the game, after a foul earlier in the match) but I wasn’t having a go at her.

'You could see she was upset and she ended up walking away.'

Emma's father added: 'When she decided to go down this route, you expect a little bit of criticism - she's a referee - so obviously we had talks about that. But on this scale, I'd never imagined it, and certainly not in an Under 9 competition.

'Not only should you pay respect to the referee but you have little children in football, coming up through the age groups. It is no example to set. The FA spend a fortune on respect for referees and it has got to start at grassroots.'

Manchester County FA pledged to investigate the incident, in a statement.

Target: Hickson believes the Liverpool-Manchester rivalry played its part in the incident

It read: 'Manchester County FA has been made aware of the alleged incident from this weekend’s game and is currently investigating the matter.

'It would therefore be inappropriate for us to make any further comment regarding that specific case at this time.

'The vast majority of football matches in Manchester occur without incident. When discipline does occur, however, it is dealt with as per FA Rules and Regulations.

'Abuse of referees is always wholly unacceptable and where necessary Manchester County FA will continue to address poor behaviour with the use of sanctions, educational workshops and the Respect campaign.'

MailOnline have contacted Manchester City but are yet to receive a comment at the time of publishing.
