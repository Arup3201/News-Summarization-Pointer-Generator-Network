Newcastle United are almost certain to wait until the summer before appointing a new head coach with Derby County boss Steve McClaren their preferred choice.

The Magpies have dismissed reports that they are in talks with former Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster.

Sportsmail spoke to representatives of the former West Germany international on Thursday after it was reported he was set to meet United officials.

Newcastle have dismissed reports linking them to former Real Madrid and Malaga manager Bernd Schuster 

But the club have rubbished those claims and it appears any attempt at contact was initiated by Schuster's camp.

Instead, Newcastle look set to wait until the end of the season before installing Alan Pardew's successor - and McClaren is at the top of their list.

He has a good relationship with Newcastle chief scout Graham Carr, who along with managing director Lee Charnley, is responsible for bringing in the new boss.

The former England coach has insisted he will not walk out on Derby's promotion push but has not ruled out a move to St James' Park come June.

John Carver, meanwhile, is set to stay in caretaker charge for the remainder of the campaign.
