The father of the jihadi from Alabama believed killed in Somalia by Al Qaeda fighters who turned against him today said that the family are still desperately hoping he is still alive.

Speaking from his Daphne, Alabama home, 
Shafik Hammami said that claims by al-Shabab's leaders that they had his
 son Omar executed in an ambush were 'ominous' - but he and wife Debra 
are still holding on to hope.

Reports on Thursday said that 29-year-old Omar, who had been on the FBI's Most Wanted terrorist list and was known for rap videos he posted to YouTube, was killed following several months on the run after falling out with the leader of al-Shabab.

But Shafik said that, as of this morning,
 he had not been notified by the Department of State that Omar had died.
 And when contacted by MailOnline, he said that he did not have any 
official confirmation yet.

'Dead': Militants in Somalia have claimed that 
American jihadist Omar Hammami has been killed. In April, he tweeted 
this pictured, right, following what he called an assassination attempt 
as he was in a tea shop

'It looks very ominous this time as opposed to the last one, but we are still hopeful that it is untrue,' Shafik, 61, told MailOnline.

Omar had been active on Twitter but his last post was on September 5 in which he said: 'I'm still a terrorist.'

A more prophetic Tweet came in April in which he said: 'May not find another chance to tweet but just remember what we said and what we stood for. God kept me alive to deliver the mssg 2 the umah'.

Reports of Hammami's death crop up every few months in Somalia, only for him to resurface alive and well a short while later.

But a U.S. terrorism expert who closely follows the inner workings of Somalia's al-Qaida-linked terror group says he thinks that the current reports of the death are accurate.

'I think it's very likely true based on the sources I am seeing,' said J.M. Berger, who runs the website Intelwire.com.

Militants did not immediately present proof of the death of Hammami, who grew up in Daphne, Alabama and was also known as Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki or 'the American'.

A
 member of al-Shabab who gave his name as Sheik Abu Mohammed told The 
Associated Press that Hammami was killed in an ambush in Somalia's 
southern Bay region. Mohammed said some of his associates carried out 
the killing.

'There was a gun battle between 
Amriki and his men and other fighters, the reports are that Amriki is 
among those killed,' Moalim Ali, a resident in Bardhere, in southern 
Somalia, told AFP.

Two other extremists were also killed in the battle, including one other foreigner.

The
 U.S. put Hammami on its Most Wanted terrorist list in March and offered
 a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture.

Hammami, one of the two most notorious Americans in overseas jihadi groups, grew up in Daphne, Alabama, a community of 20,000 outside Mobile.

Family: Hammami was born to a Christian mother, Debra, and a Syrian-born Muslim father, Shafik. His sister Dena is pictured as a baby a few years before he was born

Growing up: Hammami, pictured getting his first birthday cake in 1985, was brought up as a southern Baptist

All-American: Hammami was brought up Christian but became conflicted about his religion in his teen years

He
 
is the son of a Christian mother and a Syrian-born Muslim father. He 
attended university before quitting and moving to Toronto, where he 
married and had a daughter.

But
 wanting to pursue his dream of becoming a jihadi, he moved to Somalia 
and joined al-Shabab in about 2006. His wife did not agree with his 
beliefs and they divorced.

He once called himself 'a walking contradiction from massively different
 backgrounds who is seriously passionate about what he believes in, but 
feels he has to go about doing it while laughing at almost everything 
along the way'.

He fought alongside the group for years 
while gaining fame for posting YouTube videos of jihadi rap songs in the
 hope of attracting young American Muslims.

He posted the English-spoken
 songs even though music is forbidden in Al-Qaeda's strict 
interpretation of Islam.

Talented: Hammami, sitting far right, was extremely bright at school and entered the gifted program

Stand out: Hammami's friends said he seemed like a natural leader from a young age

Popular: Hammami was voted president of his Sophomore class and dated one of the most popular girls in school

Other videos showed him promoting the Shebab's battle to overthrow the internationally-backed government.

But Hammami had a falling out with 
al-Shabab and engaged in a long public fight with the group over the 
last year amid signs of increasing tension between Somali and foreign 
fighters in the group.

He was a thorn in the group's side 
after accusing its leaders of living extravagant lifestyles with the 
taxes fighters collect from Somali residents.

He
 also complained that Somali militant leaders sidelined foreign 
militants inside al-Shabab and were concerned only about fighting in 
Somalia, not globally.

Al 
Shabab criticized Hammami publicly in an Internet statement last 
December, saying his video releases were the result of personal 
grievances that stem from a 'narcissistic pursuit of fame'.

In April this year, Hammami shared a photograph showing him with a blood-covered neck and shirt
 and claimed there had been an assassination attempt against him while 
he sat in a tea shop.

Wanted: He ascended the ranks of Somalia's al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab high enough to attract a $5 million U.S. government bounty. This FBI listing shows their description of Hammami

'Just been shot in neck by shabab assassin. not critical yet,' Hammami tweeted in April.

He had first expressed fear for his life in a
 web video in March 2012 that publicized his rift with al-Shabab.

He later wrote on Twitter that the leader of al-Shabab was sending in forces from multiple directions.

'We are few but we might get back up. abu zubayr has gone mad. he's starting a civil war,' Hammami posted.

U.S. officials said that al-Shabaab, which has been in existence since 2006, counts several hundred foreign fighters among its ranks, including scores of Somali-Americans from Minnesota.

In July, UN Monitoring Group reports 
estimated al-Shebab has around 5,000 members and remain the 'principal 
threat to peace and security to Somalia'.

Younger years: Hammami seemed like the all-American teen in his native Daphne, Alabama

Omar Hammami was once a gifted student in 
Daphne, Alabama and the president of his Sophomore class who was dated 
the most sought-after girl in school. But within years, he was a key 
figure in one of the world's most ruthless Islamist insurgencies.

He
 was brought up as a southern Baptist who went to Bible camp and his 
mother was a typical Southern Belle who taught at an elementary school.

His father came to America from Syria and became an engineer, though he was said to keep a strict household.

Hammami's
 upbringing was immersed in American culture yet still remained 
culturally Muslim: Shoes were left at the door, Koranic inscriptions 
decorated the walls, pork was forbidden.

As
 a teenager, his passions fluctuated between Shakespeare and Kurt 
Cobain, soccer and Nintendo, friends have recalled. He had dreams of 
being a surgeon. Friends in his class said he was a natural leader and saw him become more overt about Islam after his Syrian-born father returned to the religion.

But
 after returning from a trip to Damascus the summer before his sophomore
 year, he said he was torn between Christianity and Islam. In
 an online memoir he released last year, he explained that a religious awakening
 in his teenage years led him to don a 'turban in the Bible Belt 
post-9/11'.

He attended the University of South Alabama, where he became president of the Muslim Students' Association.

In 2002, his father asked him to leave home because of arguments over religion and he quit his university studies and moved to Toronto
 to read 'blacklisted' Islamic books.

He
 was welcomed into Torontoâ€™s Somali community after marrying a young 
woman from it, but he decided to pursue his dream of becoming a jihadist
 and moved to Egypt, where he met a fellow fundamentalist from America 
who paved the road to Somalia for him.

His wife and the mother of his daughter 
refused to follow him and asked for a divorce and he eventually married a
 Somali woman, with whom he had another daughter.

As he trained, he caught the attention of his superiors with his computer knowledge, attention to detail and eloquent language skills. He quickly rose to power, eventually commanding troops, managing money and plotting strategy.
