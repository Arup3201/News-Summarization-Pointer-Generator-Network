Roberto Mancini believes Manchester City's status as Premier Champions and one of the growing forces in European football was set in motion during his reign at the Etihad Stadium.

The Italian was in charge at the Sky Blues between 2009 and 2013 - and led City to their first Premier League title in 44 years during the 2011-12 season.

City also won the FA Cup in 2011 under Mancini's tutelage before Manuel Pellegrini led the club to a Premier League and Capital One Cup double last season.

The Italian says current boss Manuel Pellegrini uses largely the same players he did and therefore he set in foundations their success, for example (from left to right) Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Sergio Aguero

And the former Inter Milan, Lazio and Fiorentina boss is adamant the foundations for City's continued success were set in place during his four years at the Etihad.

The 49-year-old, quoted in FourFourTwo, said: 'I think that we started to build this team five years ago. In two years we won the Premier League, the FA Cup, we won everything in England.

'And this current team are playing nine of my players all of the time. I am very happy with that because I know these players.

But Mancini is adamant that the foundations were laid in place during his four-year tenure at the Etihad

'I think it's not easy to build a strong team with only four or five years.

'They are a team like Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona - big teams that have been like that for 50 years. You need the time to improve. But we have a big chance also to be one of the best teams in Europe.' 

Mancini, who has been out of work since leaving Galatasaray in June, has also revealed he would be interested in managing a Bundesliga side but worries the language barrier could prove to be a stumbling block.
