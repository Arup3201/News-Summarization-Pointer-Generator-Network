Victim: Rebecca Sedwick jumped to her death on September 10. She would have been 13 this weekend

The parents of a girl whose cyber bullying allegedly drove a 12-year-old schoolmate to suicide said today their daughter's Facebook account must have been hacked because she would never do such a thing.

The Florida girls were identified by local authorities yesterday as Katelyn Roman, 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, who were arrested in connection with the death of Rebecca Sedwick, who threw herself from a tower last month.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said yesterday he arrested and named the girls after Shaw allegedly posted this heartless message on Facebook: 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***].'

Her parents told ABC she was a loving, caring young girl who is not a bully.

'My
 daughter's Facebook was hacked, she would never write anything like 
that. She's not that type of girl that would just say something like 
that.

'I would check her Facebook every time she would get on it,' the teen's mother said.

Her father added: 'My daughter don't deserve to be in the place she's in right now and I just hope that the truth comes to the surface so we can get out of this nightmare.

'If we saw something that was not right, we would've addressed it and it would've ended right then.

'I'll be honest with you, the only time 
we saw something, like her language maybe not appropriate, we would 
address her and say you can't be like this.

'And there'd be a lot of 
times where my wife would be looking through the phone and making sure 
everything's good.'

They also hit at Sheriff Judd for the vile portrait he has painted of their daughter.

Denial: Guadalupe Shaw's parents - who did not want to be pictured - said their daughter was loving and caring and would never write those terrible things

Accused: Katelyn Roman, 12, left, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, right, were arrested and charged with aggravated stalking in connection with the death of Rebecca Sedwick

Rebecca Sedwick's mother said about hearing the news: 'I felt like a big weight had been lifted. It was a mixture of tears, relief and sadness'

But he stood by his actions today and even said he would bring charges against the parents if he could.

'This girl is back on Facebook after Rebecca dying? Can you believe parents would let their child do that?

 - Sheriff Grady Judd

'We
 will not tolerate that. If I can find something to charge her parents 
with - who are in total denial about this - I will. The apple does not 
fall far from the tree.

'Rebecca
 took the bullying to heart and we are not putting up with it. When I 
stood there at the base of that tower and saw that baby - that child - 
deceased on the ground it broke my heart and I know it would break the 
hearts of people all over the country if they were in my position.

'We want to send a message out to kids that anyone who cyber stalks or cyber bullies will be punished.'

Roman's father accepted that he should have done something more in the situation.

He told ABC: 'I feel horrible for the
 whole situation. It's my fault that maybe I don't know about that kind 
of stuff but I wish I did.'

Rebecca's mother said of the arrests: 'I felt like a big weight had been lifted. It was a mixture of tears, relief and sadness.'

Her daughter would have been 13 this weekend.

Angry: Sheriff Grady Judd said today that if he can find something to charge the parents with - like delinquency of a child - he will

The sheriff said he rushed the arrest after Guadalupe Shaw allegedly wrote on Facebook: 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***]'

Rebecca was 'terrorized' by 
as many as 15 girls who ganged up on her and picked on her for months 
through online message boards and texts. She jumped to her death from a tower at an abandoned concrete plant on September 10.

Judd said they decided to arrest Shaw after she posted the 'reprehensible' message on Saturday.

'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said.

Roman was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the
 14-year-old turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped 
being friends with her in fear of being bullied, the sheriff said.

'Several students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on 
different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat
 her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said today.

He
 warned parents in a news conference yesterday: 'Watch what your 
children do online. Pay attention to what your kids are doing. Quit 
being their best friend and be their best parent.'

Roman and Shaw were 
arrested on Monday night and detained at the county's juvenile center 
before being released to their parents, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

They were charged with felony aggravated stalking.

Missed: Rebecca Sedwick took her own life after being relentlessly bullied

Several media outlets released the names and mugshots of the young girls after law enforcement officials identified them at a press conference on Tuesday.

It is believed the bullying started when Shaw started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend.

Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself.

The 12-year-old was jumped in school and repeatedly hounded in online messages or texts telling her to kill herself and that she was ugly.

Her computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' .

One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track.

She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.'

Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls.

'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said.

'She
 appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. 
And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally 
disturbing.'

Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online.

The bullying started 
over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she 
was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Roman.

Last December, 
Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because
 of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff. 

'When
 she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home 
every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, 
how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death.

'And
 I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most
 beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.'''

Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her 
elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant

Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca

Later, after Rebecca 
complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl
 wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd 
said.

This fall, Rebecca 
started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, 
Judd said. But the bullying continued online.

'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger.

'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.'

Once
 police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not
 stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm.

'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself," Ms Norman said.

She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying.

Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal.

In
 it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves 
because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize
 words do matter?'

Ms Norman
 wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other 
young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up,
 like Becca did.'
