Until the execution of his stunning strike to set Newcastle on their way to a first victory of 2015, Remy Cabella had done precious little since his arrival in the Premier League to justify a £12million price tag.

In fact, you wondered if a decimal point had been omitted from the fee which brought the France midfielder to Tyneside from Montpellier in the summer.

There was one farcical moment before his goal which comically captured Cabella’s struggle, attempting a double step-over only to trip on the ball and watch as it rolled to team-mate Sammy Ameobi – it was his first completed pass of the afternoon.

But talent clearly resides within the slight-of-frame playmaker and that much was evident from his opening goal, an uncompromising drill from outside the penalty area to mark his first for the club.

Ameobi added an equally sumptuous second after half-time and substitute Yoan Gouffran capped a fine maiden win for interim head coach John Carver, who still harbours ambition of landing the role on a permanent basis.

Results like this will certainly help, as will transforming the fortunes of Cabella.

‘I said to him before the game, “I know you have got ability, start doing something for me, give me a goal”,’ revealed Carver, who was this week confirmed as boss until the end of the season.

‘I’m so pleased for him. His all-round performance was excellent and it’s a great finish for the goal.

‘He will get stronger and fitter. It’s hard coming from another league into the Premier League and there will be bad days, that’s what happens with flair players.

‘But the best is definitely still to come from him and we saw what he is capable of today.’

For Hull boss Steve Bruce – a sodden and saddened figure amid a second-half snow flurry – the outlook is bleak. His team remain in the relegation zone, have lost four on the spin and are without a goal in six hours.

He hopes to bring in Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N’Doye and Spurs winger Aaron Lennon before Monday’s deadline, and admits his team are slipping into a perilous position.

‘This is when you earn your money as a manager,’ he said.

‘It’s my job to lift the players who are a bit shell shocked. I need to wake the players up because we’re in serious trouble.’

Bruce’s cause is hardly aided by the generosity of his sorry side. They started brightly and had shaded the opening half before Andrew Robertson, the Scotland left back, gifted possession to Cabella.

Accepting the errant pass 25 yards from goal, Cabella duly dropped a shoulder to fashion space for the shot and located the bottom corner with unerring accuracy.

Such is Hull’s desperation right now that Ahmed Elmohamady then tried his damnedest to replicate Diego Maradona’s infamous handball goal, albeit minus the Argentine’s subtlety and cunning.

The Egyptian’s hand was a good foot above his head when he punched home Ramirez’s deadball delivery. Somehow, referee Phil Dowd missed what was a blatant offence and it took the intervention of the fourth official to chalk the goal off.

Bruce said: ‘We’re struggling at the moment but we don’t want to see goals scored like that – thankfully, the officials got it right. But I don’t think it was cheating, more just a reaction because he couldn’t reach the ball with his head.’

Bruce was wrong on that, Elmohamady had cheated – his celebration and subsequent protest proved as much.

But there was no doubting the legitimacy of Newcastle’s second five minutes after half-time. Again Hull were complicit in the concession – Ramirez passing straight to Ameobi – but the winger deserves all of the credit, striding forward and smashing beyond a helpless Allan McGregor from fully 30 yards.

Hull weren’t the only ones guilty of some suicidal defending and Fabricio Coloccini’s blushes were spared when his horribly sliced clearance was headed from the line by Vurnon Anita.

Embarrassment was a recurring theme and just moments later Hull forward Nikica Jelavic, unmarked in front of an open goal, failed to adjust his feet in time to turn home Ramirez’s cross.

If Jelavic had converted then perhaps Hull might have salvaged an unlikely point. But any hope of rescuing something from the game went when Gouffran saw his 12-yard shot deflected up and over McGregor on 78 minutes.

Carver and Cabella were the last two off the pitch at the end, celebrating in front of the 2,500 travelling fans.

And the Newcastle boss reflected: ‘It was a great feeling and I’m so pleased with performance.

‘We really grew in confidence and starting keeping the ball after the first goal and were excellent, it was a performance I’ve seen coming.

‘I want this job. Everyone now knows I’m the head coach.’

Victories like this will do his chances no harm at all.
