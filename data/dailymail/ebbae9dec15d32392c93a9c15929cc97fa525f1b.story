An unrenovated one bedroom apartment in Kirribilli has gone under the hammer for $1,255,000.

The unit doesn't even come with a parking space or balcony. It does however have one redeeming feature: an astounding view of both the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge.

According to Raine & Horne Neutral Bay director Stewart Robertson, it was this view  that attracted eight registered bidders and pushed the sale price $25,000 above the reserve on Saturday.

The sale comes after an Economist study revealed that Australia is now the most overpriced housing market in the world.

In July investors borrowed a record $5.3 billion to sink into the property market, the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show. 

Investor loans now account for a 58.6 per cent of all housing finance in NSW. 

It comes after an Economist study revealed that Australia is now the most overpriced housing market in the world, and a separate study from Sydney Morning Herald showing Australia is the second most expensive housing market, when measured against incomes and rents.

The inflation in prices is believed to be a result of demand for Australian properties now exceeding the supply. 

Eight registered bidders participated in the auction on Saturday, which saw the property sell for $25,000 above reserve
