Madame Tussauds in New York will today unveil the newest members of their royal waxwork collection: Prince Harry and Her Majesty the Queen. 

The pair will join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as part of a 'royal set' which set to go on tour at the Madame Tussauds attractions across the world. The figures will be in New York through the end of the year. 

Prince Harry’s wax figure is dressed in a Dege & Skinner suit from Savile Row -- created by the actual tailor he uses for his uniforms, and he is adorned with medals: a set of three Court-Mounted full-size medals, three pairs of gilt and enamel Garter Stars, and one pair of Flying Wings.

A spokesman for Madame Tussauds New York told Mail Online Travel: 'This will be a very special experience and, for many, the only opportunity to get up close and personal with the royal family.  

'We hope the new royal set will be a hit with US visitors especially on the heels of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's exciting baby news. 

'William and Kate have always been a favorite in the attraction and we're excited to expand our royal family, and have the new figures of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Harry alongside them. 

Madame Tussauds studio artists were invited to the Palace to obtain exact measurements, photos and detailed notes of the dress - which is embellished with approximately 10,000 Swarovski crystals and took over 60 hours to complete.

Madame Tussauds enjoys a close relationship with the British Royal Family dating back to William IV, King of England when the attraction first opened in London in 1835. Their Highnesses have been closely involved with the royal figures. 

Last month, a new Prince Harry waxwork was unveiled to celebrate the prince's thirtieth birthday.

The figure, dressed in army fatigues cost £150,000 and took four months to create and replaced his 2006 model. 

Her Majesty the Queen has been modelled over 20 times and has given the studio team six personal sittings over the years.
