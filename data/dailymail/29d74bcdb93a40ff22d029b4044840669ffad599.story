American paleontologists have discovered a new species of prehistoric shark, complete with devilish horns and sinfully sharp teeth.

The shark, named Devil Tooth or Diablodontus Michaeledmundi, was extracted from a piece of limestone in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Scientists at Northern Arizona University believe it was an incredibly tough species that survived the Permian Triassic extinction - the world's largest extinction event.

In this event, commonly known as 'The Great Dying' a staggering 96 per cent of life on Earth was wiped out.

As the name might suggest, the Devil Tooth shark had incredibly sharp teeth as well as hook-shaped spikes on its head, which are thought to have evolved for defense of even sexual selection.

The spikes could have evolved to catch the eye of devil tooth sharks of the opposite sex, just as some animals use them to find a mate today.

The fearsome creature was plucked from the Kaibab Formation in Arizona and details of the fossil were published in the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, Discovery News reported.

The scientists believe the fish lived 260 million years ago and was a hybodont, or hump-toothed shark.

This group of sharks is now extinct but were close ancestors of modern sharks, according to Northern Arizona University post-graduate John-Paul Hodnett, who was lead author of the study.

'Hybodont sharks evolved during the late Paleozoic  - approximately 300 
million years ago - and miraculously survived the Permian Triassic 
extinction event into the 
Mesozoic,' he said.

The Devil Tooth shark terrorised the seas for around 50 million years and lived into the 'age of reptiles' 252 million years ago.

As well as the hook-like horns on its head, the fish sported spines on the front and back of its fins as well as the asymmetric tail associated with most modern sharks.

Mr Hodnett describe the shark's teeth as advanced and said they were: 'well developed pointed cusps with slight 
cutting edges, a feature which was not seen until later hybodonts during
the beginning of the Mesozoic.'

Judging by the size of its teeth, the Devil tooth shark was around three-and-a-half feet long - slightly smaller than a leopard shark (pictured). Mr Hodnett believes the predator's hunting style might have been similar too as it is thought Devil Tooth searched for small fish and soft-bodied marine creature to eat

Judging by the size of its teeth, the well-equipped predator was around three-and-a-half feet long, which is slightly smaller than a leopard shark.

Mr Hodnett believes that the creature's hunting style might have been similar to its modern spotty cousin as it is thought Devil Tooth sharks searched for small fish and soft-bodied marine creature to eat as well as possibly extra sea life living in coastal waters  midway to the surface.

The plains where the fossil was found were once a shallow sea that bordered a great desert some 270 million years ago.

Hodnett said: 'At this time the ancestors of modern sharks were just starting to diversify, but remained small.'

However on dry land, reptiles, dinosaurs, birds and mammals were diversifying at a greater pace.
