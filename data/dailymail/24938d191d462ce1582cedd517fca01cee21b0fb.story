The 30-year-old woman who went missing in a rainforest for 17 days told police that she could hear rescue teams calling out for her and helicopters circling the area.

Cairns police have said they believe Shannon Leah Fraser, who insists she could not get to the rescue teams despite being able to hear them, ABC reports. 

Ms Fraser - a cancer patient and mother of three- was last seen at the Golden Hole swimming spot, south of Cairns, Queensland on September 21.

Shannon Leah Fraser was reported missing on September 21 but was found by a farmer on Wednesday morning

She was found on Wednesday morning when a farmer noticed her stumbling out of the bush badly burnt, scratched up and noticeably thinner. 

Her mother says her daughter has miraculously survived a 17-day ordeal lost in rugged bushland where she lived on creek water, small fish and insects. 

'She's badly burnt, she's lost a lot of weight,' Ms Sharrock told The Courier Mail.

'She's got a lot of infected cuts from fighting the scrub. She told us she just sat in a creek for three days to soothe her cuts and burns.

'It's incredible, it's amazing, we all thought she was dead. Thank God, she's alive.'

She said her daughter was now recovering in hospital. 

The 30-year-old was last seen at the Golden Hole swimming spot, south of Cairns

Police have not confirmed any of the circumstances around Ms Fraser's reappearance, other than to say she was found safe and well on Wednesday morning.

Ms Fraser had gone to the swimming hole with two men including her partner.

Her partner later told police he'd left her sitting alone under a gazebo near the river but when he returned five or 10 minutes later, she was gone.

Her disappearance sparked an intensive search, police suspicions she might have met with foul play, and a public appeal for information by her mother.
