Resplendent in a red and blue sari with her hair twisted into an elaborate plait, Bakul looks like any other teenage girl at first glance.

But while she might have similar tastes to other teens, her life in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, is very different.

For Bakul, although just 17 years old, has already been married for two years after being forced to wed a rickshaw driver named Romy when he threatened to end his own life if she didn't.

'They said he’d commit suicide if I didn’t run away with him,' she explains, as she sits with her eight-month-old daughter, Jui, who fidgets in her arms.

Since the wedding, life has been hard with Bakul forced to swap going to school for days spent doing chores and taking care of her child.

Worse, Romy, 21, has proved to be a less than stellar husband, frequently leaving his wife and child to survive on the pittance he gives them from his wages of 400 taka (£38) a month.

'He
 spends more than he earns, and usually doesn’t give me money,' explains Bakul, who has lost weight since her wedding thanks to Romy's reluctance to provide adequate funds for food.

'Most of 
our money goes on food,' she adds. 'I really regret getting married so young. I had so much freedom
 before and didn’t have to care about my family and responsibilities.'

And she's not the only member of her family to marry young. Her mother Nashima was married off at just 13 years old and gave birth to Bakul as a 16-year-old.

'I was so young and I didn’t know my 
husband, so I was afraid of him,' says Nashima. 'I didn’t know what it meant to have a 
husband.'

Shocking though they are, Bakul and Nashima's stories are far from unusual.

20 per cent of Bangladeshi girls marry before the age of 15, while 66 per cent wed before the age of 18 - even though both scenarios are illegal.

Worldwide, one in nine girls are married off before the age of 15, with those that do running a significantly higher risk of dying in childbirth than women in their 20s.

'I have some friends who are going to 
college now and I feel bad that I can’t go with them,' adds Bakul.

'I used
 to really enjoy my school life. My teacher used to call me a singing 
bird because I would always sing and dance.'

Instead of school, Bakul's day is now dominated by chores and caring for her daughter, as well as trying to keep her husband happy.

'I
 get up at 5am for morning prayers,' she explains. 'I start cooking and go to fetch 
water from the tube well nearby.

'I look after the baby and make food and
 then think about what food to make for lunch. By 7pm I try to finish 
all of my cooking and household chores and then watch TV and watch soap 
operas.'

For Bakul, like many married girls,
 watching soap operas is the most exciting part of her day.

'One
 show I watch is Tapur Tupur,' she reveals. 'It’s the story of two sisters. I aspire to
 be like Tupur, she’s the good one, the responsible wife and 
daughter-in-law who helps everyone when they are in a bad situation.'

Sadly, for Bakul and others like her, the chances of escaping her own 'bad situation' are vanishingly small.

Global problem: India is the country with the highest number of child brides, this little girl among them

With more than 14 million child marriages each year, underage weddings are becoming an increasingly common problem worldwide but are seen more frequently in very religious countries such as Bangladesh.

'The causes of child marriage in Bangladesh are complex, and vary from context to context,' explains Kanwal Ahluwalia, a gender adviser at children's charity Plan UK.

'However, the practice is driven by boys being valued over girls and poverty, because poorer families try and marry their daughters off early due to economic pressures within the household and also because a dowry is cheaper if the girl is younger.

'Other factors include using child marriage as a way to control girls’ sexuality and prevent them marrying outside the arranged marriage system and weak enforcement of laws.'

Currently, 20 per cent of Bangladeshi girls are married by the age of 15 while another 66 per cent have wed by the age of 18, even though both are illegal.

'National laws are not implemented,' adds Ahluwalia, 'possibly because of negative views and the influence of religious and traditional leaders.'
