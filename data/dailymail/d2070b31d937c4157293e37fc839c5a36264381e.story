A 158-year-old giant redwood in the grounds of a historic estate has been hailed as the 'oldest living Christmas tree in Britain' by English Heritage.

The 100ft tree has not been used as a festive decoration in decades, but at one time it was uprooted every Christmas and brought indoors to light up the halls of a Grade I-listed mansion.

It was planted in the grounds of Wrest Park near Silsoe, Bedfordshire, by Thomas de Grey in 1856 – meaning it would have been one of the first introduced in this country.

After growing too large to be brought inside, it stood forgotten in the extensive grounds for decades until English Heritage gardeners rediscovered its surprising past.

The  English Heritage team at Wrest Park have now restored  some festive cheer to the tree with the help of a cherry picker and a 3ft star.

Visitors to the park in December will also be asked help decorate the lower branches with traditional ribbons.

The gardeners found a reference to the now 30m tree in the June 1900 edition of the Gardner's Chronicle periodical.

'It is said to have been planted by the late Mr Snow in 1856, and must therefore have been one of the first introduced into this country,' the article stated.

'Mr Ford, the late gardener at Wrest Park ... has carried the plant many times from the conservatory to the mansion, and vice versa.' 

John Watkins, English Heritage's Head of Gardens and Landscape, said: 'The Christmas tree at Wrest Park is a rare, documented example of a tree that was decorated and replanted annually during the Victorian period.

'It was planted shortly after the trend for Christmas trees began and we believe it is one of the earliest examples.

'If anyone knows of an earlier one, we'd like to hear about it. The team at Wrest Park are delighted to restore the tree's festive cheer this December by decorating it for the first time in more than a century.'

The tree is a giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum), indigenous to parts of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. 

In 1853, a British plant collector named William Lobb brought a few redwood seeds to England and the gardeners at Wrest Park must have been among the lucky few to acquire one of these seeds.

Christmas trees were introduced during the reign of Queen Victoria by Prince Albert, who had enjoyed this tradition throughout his childhood in Germany.

From the mid-19th century, families would bring trees in from their garden during the festive period and adorn them with candles, sweets and homemade decorations. 

'Christmas trees were the height of festive fashion by the 1850s after being adopted by the royal family as part of their celebrations,' said Mr Watkins. 

English Heritage is now inviting people to come forward if they know of any earlier living Christmas tree in Britain to determine whether the Wrest Park giant is truly the oldest.
