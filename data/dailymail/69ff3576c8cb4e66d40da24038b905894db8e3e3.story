A father has been accused of scalding his two-year-old son with a frying pan after the toddler asked to have his nappy changed.

Marco Santos is alleged to have grabbed a frying pan from a stove where he was cooking fish and placed it on the boy's thigh and genital area.

When the boy screamed in agony he attempted to soothe the burns by rubbing burn cream on the wound, authorities said.

Father: Marco Santos, 39, of Chicago, allegedly grabbed a frying pan from a stove where he was cooking fish and placed it on the boy's thigh and genital area

But instead of using a soothing lotion Santos, 39, used a tube of toothpaste he found at his home in Chicago, Illinois.

The injuries to the boy were only revealed three days after the incident when his parents realised he had trouble walking and took him to hospital.

An investigation was launched after emergency staff at Layola University Medical Centre suspected the burns to be a result of child abuse.

Prosecutors said Santos was cooking when his son came into the kitchen and said his nappy needed changing.

Santos pulled the nappy off, but it fell apart in his hands which prosecutors said made him even angrier.

In retaliation Santos grabbed the frying pan and held in to his son's body.

'Apparently, he gets angry and takes the frying pan and places it on the child’s thigh and genital area,' Tandra Simonton, prosecuting, said.

She said the boy will need skin grafts to repair the damage caused by the burns.

Santos was booked into the Cook County Jail on a charge of aggravated battery of a child. He remains in jail in lieu of $500,000 bond.

The boy's mother Joanna Pawlina has been charged with endangering the life and health of a child, a misdemeanor.

The little boy's wounds will require skin grafts to repair, prosecutors said during a bond hearing for Santos.
