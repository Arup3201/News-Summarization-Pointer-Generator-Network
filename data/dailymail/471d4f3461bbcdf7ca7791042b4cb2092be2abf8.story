A cricket agent boasted seven players in Pakistan's national side were fixing matches for him in a hugely lucrative betting scam, a court heard today.

Mazhar Majeed, 36, spoke of the advantages of 'grooming' younger cricketers to work with him as they would be 'around for years', Southwark Crown Court was told.

Prosecutors alleged that he also discussed deliberately losing a Test match against England last summer for a million dollars and plotted to fix games at last year's Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies.

At court: Mr Butt, centre, arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London yesterday, today the court heard a transcript of the conversation between the captain and his agent

The alleged conversation, which was recorded by reporter Mr Mahmood, was read to the jury:

Majeed allegedly said: ‘You know the maiden we were doing in the first over?’

Butt allegedly replied: ‘Yeah.’

Majeed: ‘You know the third over you face? Do one more maiden.’

Butt: ‘No, leave it, OK.’

Majeed: ‘You don’t want to do the third over?’

Butt: ‘Nai, yaar.’ (‘No, mate.’)

Majeed allegedly told undercover reporter, Mazher Mahmood, of the News of the World, who was posing as a rich businessman he had seven Pakistan cricketers working for him.

Majeed
named ‘his’ players as Butt, fast bowlers Mohammed Asif, Mohammed Amir 
and Wahab Riaz, wicket keeper Kamran Akmal, and batsmen Omar Akmal and 
Imran Farhat, although prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee said the agent explained that there 
was a ‘little question mark’ about Farhat.

Southwark Crown Court also heard Butt, 26, was allegedly taped 
confirming that he would deliberately bat a ‘maiden over’ on the final 
day of last summer’s Oval Test match, which was a chance for his side to
win their first game of the series.

Majeed discussed the arrangement
with the cricketer by phone while agreeing a deal with an undercover 
journalist posing as a rich Indian businessman who had paid £10,000 to 
fix part of the match, jurors heard

Majeed assured Mr Mahmood, also known as the fake sheikh for his undercover reporting work, Butt would score no runs in his first full over at the Oval the next day, on August 21 last year.

Accused: Salman Butt, left, and Mohammad Asif deny conspiracy to cheat 
and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments in relation to a allegation 
they agreed to fix a Test at Lords Cricket Ground

No Ball: Pakistan's Mohammed Asif bowled this no ball during day one of the npower Fourth Test at Lord's Cricket Ground

When the journalist pointed out that a 
maiden over could happen ordinarily, the agent rang the cricketer on 
speaker phone to prove he was involved in the fixing scam, the court 
heard.

Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC said: ‘If not party to this corrupt agreement, you might expect Butt to say something to the effect of ‘What are you talking about?’’

When Mr Mahmood pointed out that the cricketer sounded asleep during the phone call, Majeed is said to have said: ‘Believe me, he’s done this many times.’

The journalist asked whether Butt 
could be trusted, to which the agent allegedly replied: ‘Salman is one 
million per cent trustworthy.’

But
on August 21 Butt did not play the maiden over as planned at the Oval 
after he ended up batting earlier than expected, the court heard.

Mr Jafferjee said: ‘As events were to transpire at the Oval, matters were somewhat out of Butt’s control. To bat a maiden over requires very considerable control, which he is talented enough to manage, but not when he faces a hard, solid new ball at the beginning of the innings.’

The jury was also read earlier texts sent between Majeed and Butt in May last year in which they allegedly discussed fixing games at the Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies.

In one message the agent allegedly wrote: ‘This will only work if you score in the first two overs and no wickets.’

The undercover reporter complained to Majeed after Butt failed to bat the promised maiden over at the Oval Test, the court heard.

Mr Jafferjee said: ‘The journalist asked ‘What went wrong?’.

Majeed explained that Butt had come in much too early with the ball new and hard, and he was forced to take the run.’

As
Mr Mahmood pressed for results, the agent became indignant that his 
credentials were being questioned and claimed that his Indian 
‘customers’ would pay £400,000 without the kind of proof provided to the
reporter, the prosecutor said.

Majeed told the journalist that the cricketers he worked with had agreed to fix parts of their next game for him during two ‘brackets’ - a set period on which to bet - in return for £150,000, the court heard.

The agent allegedly said: ‘They’re not willing to give you anything, until you give a large, substantial amount. Ten grand is peanuts.’

On August 25, the day before the final Test match of the series between England and Pakistan at Lord’s, the journalist met Majeed in a room at the Copthorne Tara hotel off Kensington High Street in central London.

The jury was shown a covertly-filmed video of Mr Mahmood handing £140,000 in £50 notes to the agent, who counted out the money on a table in front of him.

The agent said in the film: ‘I’m telling you, if you play this right, you’re going to make a lot of money.’Majeed
promised the reporter that Pakistan fast bowlers Amir, 19, and Asif, 
28, would deliver three no-balls at specific points in the Lord’s Test, 
the court heard.

‘To show we are serious I’m going to give you three no-balls. No-balls are the easiest and the clearest,’ he allegedly said.

In the video the agent told the journalist that the no-balls would be delivered by Amir as the first ball of the third over, by Asif as the last ball of the 10th over and by Amir as the last ball of his first over to a right-handed England batsman.

Majeed allegedly said the no-balls would be ‘well over the mark’ to ensure that they were noted by the match officials.

Mr Jafferjee commented: ‘No umpire could possibly miss it. Asif, with his tact and greater experience would bowl a no-ball which could not fail to be called, but only inches over the popping-crease.

‘The relatively hapless Amir would end up bowling no-balls that, as a seasoned cricket statistician will tell you, were the biggest no-balls he’s ever seen.’

Sky Sports footage of the Lord’s match was played in court, and the prosecutor noted that Amir’s first invalid delivery was ‘an enormous no-ball’.

Yesterday Mr Jafferjee told the court the cricketers were deeply involved in ‘rampant corruption’ at the heart of the sport.

In
his opening speech to the jury he said the men betrayed millions of 
fans to cash in on a betting industry worth up to £33billion a year on 
the Asian sub-continent alone.

Mr
Jafferjee told Southwark Crown Court that the sums gambled overseas 
were ‘breathtaking’ and the men were motivated purely by greed.

He
said: ‘This case reveals a depressing tale of rampant corruption at the
heart of international cricket, with the key players being members of 
the Pakistan cricket team.

‘There
are vast amounts of money to be made in any betting activity if the 
results are known in advance, and all of that was at the expense of the 
integrity of the game.’

Allegations of match-fixing shook the sport to the core when the now defunct Sunday newspaper published the revelations in August last year.

Butt, 26, is accused of orchestrating the conspiracy with good friend and agent Majeed, 36, who then owned Croydon Athletic Football Club.

Star bowlers Asif, 29, and Amir, 19, were told to bowl three no-balls at pre-arranged stages of the final Test at Lords -the court heard.

The men face up to seven years in prison if they are convicted of corruption and cheating.

The trial continues.
