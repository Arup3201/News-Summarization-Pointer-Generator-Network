Call for investigation: David Davis said it was 'highly unusual' for a senior official to be involved in the detail of an industrial deal

A leading Tory yesterday heaped pressure on Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood over his role in the controversial European merger of defence giant BAE.

David Davis said the Defence Select Committee – which is probing the proposed link up between BAE and civil aviation firm EADS – should question Britain’s top mandarin, saying it was ‘highly unusual’ for such a senior official to be involved in the detail of an industrial deal.

Sir Jeremy’s role has raised eyebrows since he worked for four years at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank advising BAE Systems on the £28billion merger with the Franco-German firm.

The Mail revealed earlier this week that he has held four private meetings with BAE over the last 15 months, plus two with Morgan Stanley and another with EADS – which will control 60 per cent of the new firm.

Mr Davis said it ‘would be a good idea’ for Sir Jeremy to give evidence to the select committee.

He added: ‘I do think it’s highly unusual for someone as senior as the Cabinet Secretary to be involved in a deal like this.

‘You can imagine senior staff in the Department of Business and the Ministry of Defence taking an interest but quite why the Cabinet Secretary is involved, I’m not at all sure. It’s not something that’s within his purview.

‘I’m sure he’s been utterly proper and obeyed all the rules but the worry is that the judge of whether a civil servant has behaved appropriately is the Cabinet Secretary himself. It would have made more sense if he had delegated to other officials.’

MPs on the Defence Select Committee 
say they are seeking to call senior officials from Downing Street and 
the Ministry of Defence to give evidence about the deal.

Collaboration: BAE,which may be merged with aviation firm EADS, helped to build the Eurofighter

Sources
close to Sir Jeremy said he would be prepared to appear before the 
committee but said the onus would be on the MPs to submit a formal 
invitation.

Yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg backed the deal, saying it would further the cause of European defence integration.

His intervention is also controversial since it pre-empts a decision by Business Secretary Vince Cable about whether to refer the merger to the Competition Commission.

And his call for European defence 
cooperation will be a red rag to many Tories, who fear the deal will see
Britain’s biggest defence firm fall partly under the control of the 
French and German governments, which own shares in EADS.

'Backing the bid': Prime Minister David Cameron

In
an interview with Bloomberg Television, Mr Clegg said: ‘The two 
companies are making a case, a strong case, in favour of this merger.

‘I
personally have always been in favour, over time, of greater 
consolidation in the European defence industry.’ Mr Clegg’s words will 
fuel concerns among Tory MPs that the Government has pre-judged the 
affair.

Senior officials have already revealed that David Cameron is backing the bid as long as he receives reassurances that it will not damage relations with the Americans, who are concerned military secrets will be compromised.

And Mr Cable made clear he had no objection in principle when he told a Lib Dem fringe meeting on Monday he didn’t ‘worry about foreign ownership’ of British companies – although he refused to comment on the specifics of the deal.

Former shadow home secretary Mr Davis said: ‘They shouldn’t be briefing anything until the bid has been through the proper process. This calls for cool, measured judgment first and activity later, not the other way around.’

He added: ‘It’s very hard to see the French allowing their primary defence company to fall into foreign ownership.

‘This is very old-fashioned industrial politics, the idea that you bring big companies together to make even bigger companies. It has been a proven fallacy since the days of British Leyland.'

A spokesman for the Cabinet Secretary insisted it was ‘standard practice’ for him to show an interest in a deal involving a major government contractor like BAE.

He added: ‘He is not the lead official on this, his role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement and coordination across departments.’
