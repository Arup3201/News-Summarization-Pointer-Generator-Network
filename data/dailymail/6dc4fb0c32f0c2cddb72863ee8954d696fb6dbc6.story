A woman and her fiancé put alcohol in her disabled 13-year-old son's IV tube, killing him, police have said.

Melissa Robitille and Walter Richters III were charged on Tuesday with second-degree murder for the death of Isaac Robitille, who passed away on August 22 in their Hardwick, Vermont home.

Melissa Robitille called police at 9am that day to report that she had found the boy, who was born with a brain abnormality and needed around-the-clock care, unresponsive in his bed.

His brain abnormality was listed as the cause of death by the Vermont Medical Examiner, while alcohol was listed as a 'contributing' factor. His death was ruled a homicide.

An autopsy found his blood alcohol content was 0.146 percent, about twice the legal limit for driving.

Investigators believe that Robitille and Richters used an IV tube to administer alcohol to the boy, leading to his death. 

State police waited to charge the couple until after the autopsy and toxicology reports were complete.

The couple, both 38, were arrested and charged on October 7. They are being held at the Northeast Correctional Complex in St. Johnsbury, according to the Corrections Department. 

Vermont State Police said the couple were in custody but had not been processed in the court system as of Tuesday evening. 

Robitille detailed her son's medical condition on her blog. 

Death: Robitille, who has four older children, shared the news of her son's death on Facebook and Twitter on August 22. Authorities said she found his body in bed at 9am and called 911

Accused: Robitille told authorities she hadn't wanted an autopsy on her son, her fiance said. The medical examiner found that the boy had a blood alcohol level twice the legal driving limit in the state

Couple: Richters, left, wrote on Facebook that he and Robitille were angry about the police's response

'He has holoprosencephaly - an anomaly in which the fetal horseshoe-shaped brain doesn't fully divide into two hemispheres,' she explained. 'The doctors said he wouldn't live to be six months old. 

'He's got a bunch of other differences, but he's a delightfully happy little boy, loves math, hugs, kisses, and his dog (her name is Tickle – he named her!), and hates physical therapy.

'He speaks mostly tactile [American Sign Language]... I adore him.'

Isaac was given his dog, Tickle, by the Make-A-Wish Foundation in 2005 and his mother said at the time that she was looking forward to seeing how the animal helped him, WCAX reported.

'Isaac's going to meet so many therapy goals just chasing Tickle around and reaching out,' she said. 'He needs to learn how to reach out and feel the world - because he's afraid of things that could hurt him, because he can't see them. Later on, Tickle will learn to be an assistance dog.'

Richters also posted fond messages and pictures about the boy on Facebook and defended himself while lambasting the police response.

On a blog, his mother called Isaac a 'delightfully happy little boy, loves math, hugs, kisses, and his dog'

On Monday, a day before his arrest, he wrote: 'The police now want to ask us more questions tomorrow. The boy was well taken care of and loved. His time was his time. This is injustice and a bag of rock salt in this families wounds [sic].' 

Five days after the boy's death, he also claimed on Facebook that an autopsy had been performed on the child's body, even though Robitille told authorities she hadn't wanted 'her baby desecrated if it could be helped'.

'We have nothing to fear but everything to be angry about,' he wrote. 'We aren't criminals.'

The couple became engaged in June, according to Richters' Facebook. Robitille was previously married to a man nearly 30 years her senior and has four older children.

Robitille works for gaming company Intralot and has previously published two 'paranormal romance novels', according to online profiles.
