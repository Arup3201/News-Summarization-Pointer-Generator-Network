Arsenal star Mesut Ozil has been dragged into a public row with a fellow German footballer and accused of cheating on his pop star girlfriend Mandy Capristo.

Former Bayern Munich and Hertha Berlin player Christian Lell accused Ozil of 'muscling in' on his relationship with former girlfriend Melanie Rickinger.

In an interview with Bild, Lell somewhat ungraciously described his ex as a 'snake' and explained that she had exchanged intimate messages with Ozil on the messaging service WhatsApp.

Lell, with Melanie Rickinger during a restaurant opening in Munich in September, has accused Ozil

'Mesut exploited his fame, and muscled in on our relationship,' said Lell. 'That isn't OK'.

Ozil himself has refused to comment on the situation. 

'We are not commenting on this. We will keep an eye on the situation, and take legal action if necessary,' said his agent Roland Eitel. 

Lell's ex-girlfriend Rickinger has said her former boyfriend is 'crazy'. She has not denied the accusations of an affair with Ozil, but did insist that Lell had accessed her messages without her permission.

'I deleted everything on my phone. He must have gone on himself and backed everything up,' she said. 'He's completely crazy.'

Capristo has also refused to comment. The singer lives with the Germany international in London, and is a judge on the X Factor-style reality show 'Germany's Search for a Superstar'.

Capristo is about to release a new album, and has previously insisted that she does not accept the idea of being merely a WAG.

She said: 'You'd never say to the partner of a tennis player that they're only this or that, that's a lack of respect. So when people say I'm just a WAG, I don't care. I have too much respect for myself and my own work to even bother thinking about these people.'
