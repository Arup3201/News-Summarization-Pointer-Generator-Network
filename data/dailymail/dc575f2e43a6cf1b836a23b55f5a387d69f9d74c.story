All five were shot in the head.

According

Although the two surviving victims haven't been named, police said that they are in their late teens or early 20s.

One of them was able to give police a full account of what happened.

Speaking after the deaths of Munoz, Hernandez and Yosselm, Sheriff Adrian Garcia said: 'It's a waste of human life.

'Young people who will not get to fulfill the promise that they were born with.'

Survivors: Two other people, who were also shot were taken to hospital by air ambulance and survived
