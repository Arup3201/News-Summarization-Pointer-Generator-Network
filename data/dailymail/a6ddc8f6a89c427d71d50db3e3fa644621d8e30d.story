Passengers had to be disembarked from two Ryanair aircraft which collided on the runway at London Stansted Airport yesterday - ripping the wing tip off one jet.

Customers faced delays of up to three hours after a Warsaw-bound plane and an aircraft from Frankfurt Hahn that had just landed collided in the parking area of Stansted at about 6.45am.

Ryanair said the wing tip of one plane and the tail cone of another ‘made contact’, while Essex Police revealed routine breath tests on both pilots returned zero readings and no one was hurt.

Both of the planes were Boeing 737-800 models, which can carry up to 189 passengers.

London-based PR worker Ren Ivaldi, a passenger on 
the Warsaw-bound flight, said on Twitter: ‘Huge loud crashing noise and 
totally felt the crush sitting at the back.

‘Thank God it only hit the wing as if 
it was the body of the plane it'd been apocalypse… The other plane’s 
wing is half crushed. No electricity on plane. No toilets, no 
ventilation.’

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: 
‘[Yesterday] morning at London Stansted the wing tip and tail cone of two 
Ryanair aircraft made contact while one aircraft was taxiing to stand 
and the other was commencing pushback from stand.

‘Customers were disembarked and 
boarded two replacement aircraft which departed Stansted with a delay of
 approximately three hours.

‘Our Stansted based engineering team 
are currently investigating and will repair both aircraft and return 
them to service as soon as possible.

‘Ryanair sincerely apologises to affected customers for any inconvenience.’

Stansted Airport spokesman Chris 
Wiggan said: ‘We can confirm two aircraft were involved in a minor 
collision while on the ground at Stansted this morning.

Ren Ivaldi, passenger

‘Both planes suffered some damage but 
there were no reported injuries to passengers or crew. The airport is 
operating as normal while an Air Accident Investigation Branch 
investigation takes place.

‘Passengers from the outbound flight were offloaded onto an alternative aircraft to continue their journey.’

An Essex Police spokesman said: ‘Two 
Ryanair aircraft struck each other on the ground at Stansted Airport 
shortly before 7am on Saturday.

‘Officers from Essex Police carried 
out routine breath tests on both pilots who returned zero readings. No 
one was injured on the ground or in either aircraft.’
