A former Australian prison employee is locked up in a New York jail accused of conspiring to sell large quantities of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine through the black-market internet bazaar, Silk Road.

Peter Nash, 41, was extradited from Australia to the US last week and faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in the American jail system if convicted.

He is being held in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center ahead of an expected appearance in a Manhattan federal court this week.

Peter Nash, 41, was extradited from Australia to the US last week accused of conspiring to sell large quantities of drugs through the black-market internet drug supermarket Silk Road

'Silk Road was used by several thousand drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to well over a 100,000 buyers,' the indictment against Nash and two co-accused.

New York's top federal prosecutor, Preet Bharara, announced a year ago the unsealing of the indictment against Brisbane-based Nash and the two other alleged site administrators, Virginia's Andrew Jones, 25, and Ireland's Gary Davis, 26.

Silk Road's alleged San Francisco-based owner and operator, Ross Ulbricht, known by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested on October 1 last year.

Nash, a former behavioural scientist at Queensland's Wacol Prison, was allegedly known on the site by aliases 'Batman73' and 'Samesamebutdifferent'.

He was the primary moderator on the Silk Road site, sent Ulbricht a 'weekly report' of his work and was paid between $US50,000 and $US75,000 a year, according to prosecutors.

As well as selling drugs and other illicit items, the Silk Road site provided the platform for the sale of computer hacking software, including 'password stealers, keyloggers and remote access tools'.

Nash is charged with narcotics conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, if convicted.

He is also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking and one count of money laundering conspiracy.

They carry maximum sentences of five and 20 years' prison respectively.

Silk Road allegedly operated via the 'deep web', an area of the internet off limits to standard search engines, and involved a Tor hidden service designed to allow users to browse and buy items anonymously.

US authorities shut the site down in 2013 when Ulbricht was arrested and another, known as Silk Road 2.0, came online soon after, but was also closed by authorities.
