After winning his third Super Bowl MVP, Tom Brady paid tribute to Malcolm Butler after the cornerback’s last-gasp interception sealed victory for the New England Patriots.

The Seattle Seahawks opted to pass not run while camped on the edge of the Patriots’ end zone. And Russell Wilson’s pass was snatched by Butler to give the game to Bill Belichick’s men.

Unbelievable play from Malcolm,’ Brady said. ‘We didn’t call a timeout and the clock was winding down and we realised, you know, this is basically it if we stopped them.
