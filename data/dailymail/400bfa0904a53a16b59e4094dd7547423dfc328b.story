Robbie Henshaw went toe-to-toe with the mighty South Africa on Saturday as Ireland produced a stunning display to record a surprise 29-15 win against the Sprinkboks at the Aviva Stadium.

Henshaw formed one half of a duo with Jared Payne in the middle that put in a brave defensive performance against the second best team in the world.

But video footage has now emerged of the young centre being given the fright of his life by Connacht team-mate and prankster JP Cooney.

Cooney hides behind a door and waits for the unsuspecting Henshaw to enter his house in Galway, before jumping out and scaring the life out him.

The 24-year-old Cooney recorded the incident, capturing the fear on the face of the petrified Henshaw, who lets out an expletive-laden cry.

Henshaw is set to win his fifth international cap when Ireland take on Georgia in Dublin this weekend.
