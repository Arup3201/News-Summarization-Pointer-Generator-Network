It's widely regarded as one of the coolest fashion retailers on the high street so who better to showcase Topshop's Christmas collection than Brit It girl, Cara Delevingne? 

The supermodel, who is currently the face of the shopping mecca's AW14 range, has been unveiled as the face of the sparkly Christmas campaign.

As well as modelling the seasonal offerings in a set of dazzling campaign shots, the 22-year-old puts her theatrical talents to good use in an accompanying campaign video.

She's back with a bang: Cara Delevingne, who was unveiled as the face of Topshop's AW14 campaign this summer, has today been revealed as the store's Christmas campaign star

Don't for a minute think you'll catch her smouldering in sequins because the young star, known and loved in the industry for her wacky personality, can be seen punching the air with boxing gloves on and singing her heart out.

The budding thespian looks edgy in the grungy style shots as she models pussy bow blouses, flattering black jumpsuits and feather embellished party dresses.

Doing what she does best: Cara may have been taking some time away from modelling to pursue her acting career but she proves her worth as a supermodel in these new shots

Long-time family member: Cara's first appearance for Topshop was in 2010 when she featured in a campaign video alongside Kate Moss and the 21-year-old has strutted her stuff down the Topshop catwalk many times since

The unveiling of her new campaign comes in the same week as the latest store opening in New York.

The new flagship on 5th Avenue is the second largest store in the world after the iconic 100,000sq ft. Oxford Circus store in London.

Cara and sister Poppy were joined on the black carpet by Sir Phillip Green, the founder of Topshop, along with a slew of other stars.

Fellow British model, Jourdan Dunn, looked fierce in a revealing lace top teamed with a fringe skirt while Sir Philip’s Green’s daughter, Chloe Green, looked chic in a glittering black ensemble.

Steal her style: With her 1.75 million Twitter following, it's no wonder Topshop boss Sir Philip Green is glad to have her on board and showcase the new range

Happy to have her: Sir Philip said of the model: 'It's fitting to have a fabulous, young British star such as Cara at the epicentre of our campaign'

Topshop’s latest business partner, Beyonce, was also at the party, which also saw the likes of Lionel Richie, Ciara, designer Tommy Hilfiger and the Hilton sisters in attendance. 

Previous Topshop campaigns have featured Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Lily Donaldson, Rosie Tapner and Eliza Cummings in the early stages of their careers. Best friends Jourdan Dunn and Karlie Kloss also met on a Topshop campaign shoot.

Cara’s first appearance for Topshop was in 2010 when she featured in a campaign video alongside Kate Moss and the 21-year-old has strutted her stuff down the Topshop catwalk many times since.

Topshop and Cara also made history together at London Fashion Week when the model live-streamed from the runway by carrying a Google-cam concealed in her handbag. 

With her 1.75 million Twitter following, it's no wonder Topshop boss Sir Philip Green is glad to have her on board. 

'At such an ambitious and exciting time for our many thousands of staff and loyal customers, it is fitting to have a fabulous, young British star such as Cara at the epicentre of our campaign,' he said earlier this year.

The party season is almost upon us so you know what that means! An excuse to shop for glittery, glamorous dresses. Woohoo.

And if these campaign images are anything to go by then Topshop's Christmas collection has got it all sorted. With embellished jumpsuits, feather trim heels, sparkly dresses and even glitzy tights, there's a dance floor-ready look for everyone.

And this metallic halter neck dress is a favourite. It looks gorgeous on Cara Delevingne but will suit any shape thanks to its fit-and-flare cut. It'll nip you in at the waist and the pleats will disguise any lumps and bumps you're not so keen on. And who can resist a gold shimmer that's sure to catch the light as you shake your stuff?

Click the link (right) to buy it now before it sells out, which is pretty much a guarantee, then style with simple black courts or a pair of high heel sandals. Sling over your biker jacket to add a tougher edge and your party look 2014 is complete.

'Cara is a true Topshop girl,' says Kate. 'Her style is confident and playful and she can be sophisticated and chic as easily as she can be cool and casual.

'Putting her spin on everything she makes the Topshop collection her own. Her uninhibited natural energy is intoxicating, she is free-spirited and fun.'
