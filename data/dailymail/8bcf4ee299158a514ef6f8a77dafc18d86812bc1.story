The majority of teenage girls don't often think about their fertility when they are still in high school. 

But Jaida Wand didn't have a choice.

When the 17-year-old from Coogee in Sydney finishes her HSC this year, she has decided to freeze her eggs  to have the best chance of having children later in life. 

Jaida, who was diagnosed with stage three Hodgkin's lymphoma in November 2013, underwent six months of gruelling chemotherapy. 

But she still doesn't know for sure how the treatment affected her fertility.

'When I got diagnosed, everything happened so fast. (Within a week) we went to see a fertility specialist. I was in my pyjamas in the waiting room,' Jaida told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I was worried about having to do homework two days before and then I was having to worry about having kids.

'I asked the doctor if my cancer would effect (my ovaries)... she didn't know and that was pretty shocking. I was really sick - stage three out of four - so it was too late to freeze my eggs. I had to jump into treatment the next day.

'I was just about to start treatment that was going to make me look like a different person... and I had to think about whether I was going to be infertile - it was crazy and shocking.'

Jaida says she's eligible to have her eggs frozen now, but she will wait until after her HSC to go through the processes. 

'So when I'm 35 I'll have eggs of a 17-year-old... it's pretty weird,' she said.  

She is among thousands of young cancer patients who are participating in a world first online registry that will collect data from their medical history and inform them on their ability to have a child after diagnosis.

The Australiasian Oncofertility Registry is headed by Jaida's oncologist, Dr Antoinette Anazodo, who works out of both the Prince of Wales Hospital and Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick.

Jaida, who was in Year 10 when she was diagnosed, said several of her friends shaved their heads in support

'Once a patient finishes treatment they may not be able to accurately recall the drugs or treatment received as a result of their diagnosis,' Dr Anazodo said.

'As some cancer drugs can cause reproductive challenges, the registry will be able to assist cancer patients and survivors by providing information at a later date when they choose to start their family.'

Dr Anazodo said outcomes generated from the registry will also assist cancer clinicians in providing accurate risk projections for a patient's future infertility after cancer treatment.

While Jaida isn't interested in having children now, she said it was comforting to know she could potentially still have them.

'When I got sick it was pretty overwhelming and devastating. I had to give up my social life for a while and I kept thinking it was okay because things would get better. But then I thought maybe my fertility wouldn't,' she said.

'I didn't want my cancer to define me.'

The bubbly teenager made it to her Year 10 formal by rescheduling her chemo treatments. She wore an 'amazing' wig (pictured) that she joked was better than her normal hair

Jaida said she had to give up her social life and had to miss school while she was undergoing treatment

Jaida would spend three days in hospital every time she had a round of intense chemotherapy

Jaida had to miss out on classes at school and most social events during her treatment, but she did make it to her Year 10 formal.

'We scheduled my chemo around my formal. The most annoying part (of treatment) was losing my hair. I lost everything - my eyebrows, eyelashes. I wore this amazing wig to the formal and it was better than my normal hair,' she said. 

Since finishing treatment, Jaida and her family have been making up for lost time.

'As soon as I finished treatment, my parents took me and four friends to Fiji to celebrate. They've been spoiling me like crazy.

'I've also been to Japan, Dubai and Turkey.'

Jaida will finish her HSC at the end of the year and plans to study science at university. She says she's making the most of life after six months of intense treatment

She plans to study science at university when she finishes high school, but admits she'd love to work in oncology and learn more about cancer.

'I look at myself a year ago and I was bald in hospital and sick. Now I've got a tan and I'm going to the beach.

'Things could have been a lot worse. I'm really lucky that mine was curable. It doesn't mean I didn't have a bad experience - I lost my innocence, it changed my life, I had to grow up a lot faster.'
