William Rousan, 57, was executed for  killing a farming couple in 1993

A death row inmate in Missouri who was convicted of killing a farming couple in 1993 has been executed despite pleas for clemency over the secrecy used to obtain the lethal injection drug.

William Rousan, 57, was declared dead at 12:10 a.m at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, which is just a few miles from the farm where the killings took place.

Prosecutors say Rousan, his teenage son Brent Rousan and William's brother Robert Rousan murdered Charlie and Grace Lewis on Sept. 21, 1993 as part of a plot to steal two of the couple's cows.

Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down Rousan's request to delay his execution.

Efforts
 to spare Rousan's life hinged an argument that has held little sway 
over the courts - concerns about the secrecy used to obtain the 
execution drug, and the possibility that a substandard drug could cause 
pain and suffering in the execution process.

Several
 states, including Missouri, now use compounded execution drugs 
purchased from unnamed pharmacies.

Courts so far have allowed most 
executions to move forward.

However,
 on Monday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court stayed the executions of two 
death row inmates, Clayton Lockett, 38, and Charles Warner, 46, who challenged the secrecy surrounding the process of 
procuring execution drugs.

Gov. Jay Nixon declined Rousan's clemency request Tuesday evening, clearing the way for the execution to proceed.

In a statement explaining his decision, Nixon said he thought Rousan's sentence was appropriate for his alleged role as the mastermind behind the 'cold-blooded plot' that led to the couple's slayings.

On Tuesday, he met with relatives, spoke with attorneys and had his last meal: a bacon cheeseburger, onion rings, soft drink, and pecan pie.

Missouri has executed one death row inmate each month since November.

Another Missouri inmate, Russell Bucklew, is scheduled for execution on May 21.

Only Texas, with seven executions, has executed more inmates than Missouri's four so far in 2014.

Rousan was sentenced to death for the killing of 62-year-old Grace Lewis, of rural St. Francois County, in 1993.

He was sentenced to life in prison in the death of her 67-year-old husband, Charles.

The killings were part of a plot to steal cattle from the Lewis farm near Bonne Terre.

Rousan also lived in the same area of St. Francois County, about 70 miles southwest of St. Louis.

On Sept. 21, 1993, Rousan, his 16-year-old son and his brother concocted a plan to kill the couple and steal their cattle. Authorities said at trial that William Rousan was the ringleader.

The men drove by the farm, and William Rousan pointed out the cattle to steal.

They parked about two miles away and hiked through the woods to the farm.

They watched as the couple returned home. Charles Lewis began cutting the lawn with a riding mower while his wife spoke to the couple's daughter on the phone.

Brent Rousan ambushed Charles Lewis, shooting him six times.

Grace Lewis told her daughter on the phone she heard gunfire and stepped outside to check on the commotion. Brent Rousan shot her several times.

She managed to go back into the home, but William Rousan followed her, placed a garment bag over her head and carried her outside.

He turned to his son and said, 'Finish her off.' Brent Rousan fired a single shot into the side of her head.

Brent Rousan is serving life in prison without parole.

Robert Rousan served seven years after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.
