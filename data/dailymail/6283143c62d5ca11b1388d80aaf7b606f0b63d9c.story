A steep rise in the number of whiplash claims in the UK adds around £90 to the average insurance policy and has led to Britain being dubbed the 'whiplash capital of the world'.

There are some 1,500 whiplash claims in the UK every day and insurers have warned the Government that the cost of car insurance will only fall if an independent medical panel is set up to assess injuries and make it easier for firms to challenge claims.

The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has told the House of Commons Transport Committee that the motor insurance industry paid out £10.7 billion in claims in 2011, of which whiplash claims cost around £2.2 billion.

Compensation culture: An increasing number of insurance claims has seen Britain dubbed the 'whiplash capital of the world' and insurance premiums are on the rise

The ABI said that while there were a number of factors that affected the price of a premium, and individual insurers priced their policies differently, the cost of claims was highly indicative of the overall level of premium that an average motorist can expect to pay.

It added that the average paid premium in 2011 was £440. With whiplash claims representing 20 per cent of overall claims expenditure, or £90 of the average premium.

The ABI said in its written evidence: 'There are a number of contributing factors that have led to the rise in whiplash claims.

'The first factor is the dysfunctional compensation system which has led to a growing compensation culture in the UK.

'Aggressive marketing by claims management companies and referral fees paid by claimant solicitors (banned from April 1 this year), have led to an increasing number of personal injury claims in general, and whiplash claims specifically.'

Answering in its written evidence the question: 'Is it correct in describing Great Britain as the "whiplash capital of the world?"', the ABI replied: 'Yes'.

It went on: 'Although the lack of an objective test for minor whiplash injuries is an international problem, it is the UK’s civil litigation system and wider compensation culture which has led to the steep rise in whiplash claims in recent years.'

High claims: The UK still has substantially higher than average percentage of whiplash claims as a proportion of personal injury claims, than its EU counterparts

The ABI added that little had changed since 2004 when Europe-wide research showed that the UK had twice the average percentage of whiplash claims as a proportion of personal injury claims compared with the European average.

It added that latest figures show that 'the UK still has substantially higher than average percentage of whiplash claims as a proportion of personal injury claims, than our EU counterparts'.

The Government has proposed creating a panel of medical experts to oversee accident claims.

It also wants to make it easier for firms to challenge claims by raising the threshold of claims in the small claims court from £1,000 to £5,000.
