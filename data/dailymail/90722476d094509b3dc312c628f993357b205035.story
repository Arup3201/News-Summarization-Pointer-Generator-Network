New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will ask England players Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling to join the club’s pre-season tour in America after their early exit from the World Cup.

United embark on a five-game trip to America on July 17 as part of their preparations for the 2014-15 campaign.

Van Gaal had initially expected to be without the club’s England stars for the majority of the trip as all World Cup players are given a four-week break following their elimination from the tournament.

No rest: Wayne Rooney and Welbeck will be expected to feature on United's tour of America

But Rooney and the other three players can now expect to be in the United States for the second tour game against Roma in Denver on July 26.

England will fly back from Brazil following their dead-rubber fixture against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday while United’s non-World Cup players will report for pre-season training on July 23 – the date of the Van Gaal’s first game in charge, against LA Galaxy in Pasadena.

Spanish pair Juan Mata and David de Gea are also set to figure on the tour following Spain’s unexpected failure to progress from Group B.

Certainly this will in Van Gaal’s favour as he tries to get to know his new squad ahead of the Barclays Premier League season.
