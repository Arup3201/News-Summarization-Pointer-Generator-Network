It's a long way to the Guinness Pro12 play-offs but Gregor Townsend will know his Glasgow Warriors are already producing title-winning performances after Niko Matawalu came off the bench to stun Cardiff with two killer tries.

Any thoughts that their opening-day success against defending champions Leinster was a flash in the pan were quickly dispelled with this impressive victory over one of the summer’s busiest teams.

Cardiff Blues had bucked the trend among Welsh regions by recruiting, and recruiting big, especially in the capture of British Lions anchor Adam Jones, All Black lock Jarrad Hoeata and Italy No8 Monoa Vosowai. 

Niko Matawalu dives past the tackle of Cardiff's Rhys Patchell to score his first try of the day

Cardiff Blues: A Thomas; A Cuthbert, C Allen (R Smith 62), G Evans, D Fish; R Patchell (G Davies 70), L Jones (L Williams 54); S Hobbs (T Filise 70), M Rees (capt, K Dacey 65), A Jones (S Andrews 70), J Hoeata (M Cook 55), F Paulo, J Turnbull (J Navidi 65), S Warburton, M Vosawai.

Pens – R Patchell (4)

Glasgow: P Murchie; T Seymour, M Bennett (D Weir 54), A Dunbar, S Lamont; P Horne (D Van de Merwe 65), H Pyrgos (N Matawalu 54); A Allan (G Reid 55), P MacArthur (F Brown 40), R de Klerk (J Yanuyanutawa 40), T Swinson, J Gray (L Nakarawa 68), R Harley, C Fusaro (J Eddie 75), J Strauss (capt).

Tries – S Lamont, Matawalu (2). Cons – H Pyrgos, D Weir (2). Pens – H Pyrgos (2), D Wier (2).

Referee: John Lacey (Ireland)

All three were on show here at the Arms Park but even their considerable presence could not disrupt the Warriors’ bright start to the season.

A yellow card for Gordon Reid failed to halt the visitors’ momentum as the finishing prowess of Matawalu and Sean Lamont proved decisive.

Matawalu scored twice as a second-half replacement after Lamont had put Glasgow on course for an opportunist win that sends them up to second place.

Henry Pyrgos and Duncan Weir added a brace of penalties apiece to cancel out Rhys Patchell’s four converted efforts for the Blues. And Townsend will have been equally satisfied by the fact his men kept the likes of Alex Cuthbert at bay.

‘We knew this would be a tough game so we’re delighted at this win,’ said the head coach. ‘We showed a lot of character at a time when Cardiff were getting the momentum in the second-half when we were down to 14 men but we really stepped it up.

‘You could see that again when four of our players chased back after a Blues interception, even though the referee brought it back for an earlier penalty.

‘Our bench made a big impact to help us get the two tries and that really got us in a comfortable position.

‘Jerry Yanuyanutawa really stuck to his task after coming off the bench having only recently converted to the tight-head side of the scrum.

‘We were more accurate than them, there wasn’t a scrum during the whole time we had a man in the sin-bin.

‘We’d love to be back in the play-offs, but we’re only two games in with 20 to go and we know how hard it is to get a home semi-final.

‘The difference was that we took our opportunities from their mistakes whereas they didn’t.’

The Warriors had been sent an early warning by Blues fly-half Patchell. The 22-year-old, fresh from notching up 21 points against Zebre, fly-hacked his own chip towards Dan Fish deep in Glasgow territory but Tommy Seymour was on hand with a last-ditch tackle. However, Glasgow’s forwards were hasty at a maul and Patchell kicked the opening points.

Pyrgos equalised with his opening effort and traded penalties again with Patchell after Wales hooker Matthew Rees was twice penalised.

The artificial surface at the Arms Park, coupled with ideal conditions for running rugby, made for an end-to-end spectacle. 

Rhys Patchell can't stop Sean Lamont running in for his try after the ball was stripped from Cory Allen

But last season’s beaten finalists showed the opportunism that saw them overcome Leinster last weekend to claim the first try.

Lamont combined strength and speed to mark his return to the starting team with a try.

The Scotland wing robbed Cory Allen of possession. That was no mean feat in itself given the powerful young centre has already been capped by Warren Gatland.

Yet Lamont is no lightweight either and showed a clean pair of heels as he thundered down the left-hand touchline, out-pacing the covering defence, to hand the Warriors a 13-6 lead at half-time.

Townsend brought front-rowers Fraser Brown and Yanuyanutawa on for the second half in an attempt to stifle the driving prowess of 100-cap Jones. Yet even that failed to bolt the doors as the Cardiff scrum shunted Glasgow’s forwards off the ball to win a penalty, five metres inside their own territory, that Patchell kicked.

The tide appeared to be turning inextricably in the hosts’ favour when replacement hooker Reid was binned, just moments after taking the field, as Glasgow’s scrum threatened to implode under pressure.

But Townsend’s men mustered their spirits and managed to round the wagons and survive the 10-minute spell without further punishment.

It was the display of potential champions and proved a turning point here in Cardiff.

Townsend’s forward replacements had precious little impact but the introduction of Matawalu and Weir on 54 minutes was to prove decisive.

Matawalu, with his first touch, pounced upon a loose pass intended for Fish and raced into the corner. It was against the run of play but highlighted the gulf between the team’s finishing abilities.

Weir converted and added a further penalty to stretch Glasgow’s lead to 11 points with just 17 minutes remaining.

That lead impacted on Cardiff whose discipline deserted them amid the pressure of chasing the game. They conceded more penalties than any other team in the opening round of the season and that told once more five minutes later. It was only good news for Weir.

But it was his half-back partner Matawalu who delivered the knock-out blow on 70 minutes.

DTH Van de Merwe broke clear of the Cardiff defence on the left wing and found the 19-cap international in space and he saw off the scrambling Blues defence to wrap the game up. Weir again converted.

The hosts continued to bully the Warriors at the set-piece for the final 10 minutes, but Townsend’s men managed to outfox the Blues to maintain their 100 percent start to the campaign.
