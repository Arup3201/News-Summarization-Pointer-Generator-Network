Sir Alex Ferguson has expressed his happiness at seeing old rival Arsene Wenger win the FA Cup last season - but doubts that the Arsenal manager will surpass his 26-and-a-half-year reign.

Wenger is currently the longest-serving manager in the Premier League, having been in charge of the Gunners for 18 years.

And Ferguson admitted he was happy for the Frenchman when Arsenal ended a nine-year trophy drought in May with a 3-2 victory against Hull City in the FA Cup final at Wembley.

In a new updated version of My Autobiography, Ferguson wrote: 'The model I represented has passed into history. You won’t see anyone manage one club for 26 years. I must say, though, that Arsene Wenger’s reign at Arsenal deserves a special mention.

'Everyone was happy for him winning the FA Cup. I was hoping Steve Bruce would win it for Hull because he was one of my players; but you also had to have a special feeling for Arsene, given the pressure he was under for not winning a trophy for nine years.'

Wenger would have to remain in charge at the Emirates until April 2023 to surpass Ferguson's United reign - something the former Old Trafford boss thinks is unlikely.

Ferguson wrote: 'Who is to say that Arsene will not beat my record? I have my doubts, but he’s having a good crack at it.'

Ferguson and Wenger had a long-lasting rivalry of more than 16 years, with one of the most famous moments being the 'Pizzagate' incident in 2004.

The incident happened when United ended Arsenal's 49-match unbeaten Premier League run.

Ferguson had a slice of pizza thrown at him after arguments in the tunnel between players and staff from the two teams.

He later admitted he did not know who had thrown it.

The animosity led to a Metropolitan Police commander urging the two bosses to end their feud the following year.

The rift was eventually healed in 2009 when Wenger invited the United staff into his office at a Champions League semi-final at the Emirates.
