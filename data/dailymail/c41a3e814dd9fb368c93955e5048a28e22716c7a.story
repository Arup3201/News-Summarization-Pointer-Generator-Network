Melanie Brown, who killed herself after having relationship with two of her bosses - one male and one female, an inquest was told

A charity worker who hanged herself after her lesbian ex-lover began a romance with her best friend left notes in which she said she wished she could ‘sleep for ever’.

Melanie Brown, 27, felt she ‘would be better off dead’ after a series of failed relationships and what she saw as betrayal by her former lover – who was also her boss – and the friend, an inquest heard yesterday.

And a doctor said she would carry a rope around with her, which showed she had suicidal tendencies.

Miss Brown, who had a history of depression, had a six-month relationship with Kim Hamilton, 53, the £120,000-a-year chief executive of the Blue Cross animal charity.

The inquest heard that Miss Brown ended the romance thinking it was for her boss’s benefit, only to see Miss Hamilton – who has since left Blue Cross – switch her allegiance to one of her best friends.

Bisexual Miss Brown, an admin assistant, then started dating Mike Crossley, 52, the head of fund-raising for the charity, based in Burford, Oxfordshire. But he was then dismissed from his £80,000-a-year job.

There were reports that Miss Hamilton, a former City trader, had sacked him with a gagging clause and a £60,000 pay-off.

Eight months later, in August last year, Miss Brown hanged herself in the bathroom of her shared flat in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

In notes found on her computer said she would be better off dead so she could no longer ‘hurt anyone’.

The inquest heard that her laptop had been accessed nine days after her death and the internet history deleted, but a computer analyst was unable to say if files and emails had also been removed.

The inquest heard how bisexual Miss Brown had a six-month relationship with Kim Hamilton, left, before ending it for her boss's benefit. She then had relations with Mike Crossley, right

Gloucester coroner David Dooley, who 
recorded a verdict of suicide, said: ‘A lengthy note was found on her 
laptop where she spoke about her mental health and her frustration 
things were not going anywhere.

‘She
 said she was still in the same job and spoke about colleagues. She says
 she “still wakes up wishing I was dead”. She speaks of a relationship 
of six months or more with another lady but she felt she was hurting the
 other lady and terminated the relationship.

‘The
 other lady then set up with Melanie’s best friend which caused her more
 consternation even though it had been Melanie who had terminated the 
relationship earlier.

‘She 
then refers to another relationship where it appears to be with a man. 
She finishes with, “I wish I could sleep for ever because that is the 
only time I can forget. Forget about my life, forget about crying and 
forget about how fat I am and forget about killing myself”.’

The charity's CEO Miss Hamilton then allegedly fired Mr Crossley after learning about his relationship with Miss Brown. The admin assistant, 27, had a history of depression and was seeing a psychiatrist, the inquest was told

In one, undated, note she wrote: ‘I 
hurt everyone I get close to ... I’m wondering if it may be better if 
I’m somewhere where I can’t hurt anyone any more.’

Another,
 dated July 8, 2013, and believed to be the last note before her death 
on August 5, said: ‘Today I thought about hanging myself, just a few 
passing thoughts, nothing like I used to but it seems to me that I get 
that feeling again when I take too much emotion, like the thought of 
hurting someone would be too much so it is better if I stopped it.’

The
 inquest heard that in 2012 Miss Brown had struggled with the breakdown 
of an earlier same-sex relationship lasting seven-and-a-half years.

She
 was diagnosed with a mixed personality disorder and attended regular 
check-ups and appointments. Doctors noted that she experienced 
‘increased intensity of suicidal thoughts’ and was self-harming.

Summarising
 her medical care, psychiatrist Dr Svetlin Vrabtchev said: ‘She would 
carry a rope around with her showing suicidal tendencies. An important 
aspect was relationships with others. She found how to manage 
relationships particularly difficult, especially how to manage 
boundaries.

Blue Cross is a charity which provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership

‘She was 
struggling with her identity due to early experiences which left her 
believing all people were dangerous and must be loved and pleased in 
order for her to be liked.’

Recording
 a verdict of suicide, the coroner said: ‘Melanie Brown was a very 
troubled lady at the time of her death.’ He said her relationships with 
her colleagues were ‘not matters to judge upon in a coroner’s court, but
 her feelings and state of mind afterwards is important’.

Her
 history of depression and suicidal tendencies would have contributed to
 her feelings of vulnerability brought on by her ‘loneliness and 
isolation’, he said.

Forensic computer analyst Stephen Lewer said the internet history had been deleted but he was unable to say if files and emails had also been removed.
