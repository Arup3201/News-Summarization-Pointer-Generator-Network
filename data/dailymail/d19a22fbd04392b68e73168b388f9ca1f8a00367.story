Whether it's a wrinkly decolletage or wobbly tummy, fretting about errant body parts can kill the mood when it comes to spending time in the sack.

Now a spa has launched a package that claims to banish bodily woes and boost confidence in bed, courtesy of treatments that deal with everything from loose vaginal muscles to a less-than-lovely cleavage.

But it doesn't come cheap - a boudoir-ready body will cost £850, although you can have each treatment individually.

New look: London's EF Medispa can give your nether regions and your cleavage a new lease of life

First on the menu is the spa's Neckline Define Peel, £350 per treatment, which involves using Pyruvic acid and Acetyl glucosamine to smooth and hydrate the neck and bust, ironing out wrinkles in the process.

Once your decollete has been given a new lease of life, London's EF Medispa will give your legs some love courtesy of permanent laser hair removal, which costs £270 per session and will leave your pins fuzz-free forever.

Lastly, the spa will give your lady area a makeover with the AQ Vaginal Rejuvenating System, which tightens and lubricates your nether region.

The serum, which costs £220 for a month's supply, was originally developed as a cream for wounds by the University of California Irvine's Professor Ahmed Al-Aqhtani and contains ethically sourced 'progenitor foreskin stem cells', which are thought to help boost cell renewal.

New package: The EF Medispa is offering a combination of treatments designed to boost bedroom confidence

Anti-ageing: The cleavage peel will give you a smooth bust area like Kelly Brook and Sharon Stone

Laser: The final part of the package includes having the hair on your legs permanently removed with a laser

Inventor: Founder Esther Fieldgrass is behind the rejuvenating combination of treatments

Other ingredients include jojoba and rosemary oils, both of which have hydrating properties, and smoothing lactic acid.

‘In America, it doesn’t stay on the shelves because it is so popular and we have found it to be a very similar case at EF Medispa,' revealed founder Esther Fieldgrass.

'This treatment gives absolutely amazing results to both older women and younger women, because not only does it work to naturally rejuvenate the vagina and restore and improve the vagina’s natural lubrication, it also encourages blood flow to the area, which intensifies pleasure.' 

Although not part of the £850 package, the spa also offers other body-boosting treatments, among them an 'Instant Butt Lift' injection which involves taking fat from the stomach and inserting it into the buttocks.

The new body-boosting package is the latest in a series of treatments designed to perfect the nether regions.

Most, among them vaginal steaming, which is said to leave the nether regions squeaky clean, and the vaginoplasty, which reshapes the area, first appeared in the USA before making their way to Europe.

The original vajacial, the brainchild of San Francisco waxing bar owner, Katherine Goldman, was launched in 2010 and is designed to tackle ingrown hairs via a papaya enzyme mask, a deep cleanse and extractions done with tweezers.
