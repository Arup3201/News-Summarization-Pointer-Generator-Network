Michael Dowd, 28, is the first to admit in court a public disorder offence during the Black Friday discounts which led to a scramble for cheap goods

A greedy Black Friday shopper who punched a Tesco worker during a 'retail riot' has been told he faces jail. 

Michael Dowd, 28, also threatened to 'smash the face in' of another store assistant when he was ticked off for jumping the queue as he and hundreds of other customers descended on the store in Irlam, near Salford, Greater Manchester.

He is the first to admit in court a public disorder offence during last month's discounts which sparked a frenetic scramble for cheap goodies.  

The mad rush during the Black Friday sales led to scenes of mayhem and violence across the country, with a shocking seven incidents at Tescos in the Greater Manchester area alone.

It is thought several of the midnight shoppers had been drinking in nearby pubs until closing time. 

Manchester magistrates' court heard today Mr Dowd, from Pendleton in Salford, was told off by Tesco worker Julie Veldhoven for jumping in the queue.

It was alleged he told Miss Veldhoven, a sales assistant, 'don't get stroppy with me or I'll smash your f***ing face in'.

The court heard how she told Mr Dowd to return to the queue and was joined by a male colleague, Darren Herrington, who was then punched in the face by Mr Dowd.

Subhanur Chowdhury, prosecuting told the court: 'He didn't see the punch coming and his head was shot back. He suffered a breakage of the skin on his right hand when he tried to protect his face.'

Today Mr Dowd pleaded guilty to one count of assault and of using threatening and abusive words or behaviour.

Abigail Henry, defending Mr Dowd, said he was convicted of theft from a retail store last month and sentenced to a conditional discharge, which he was now in breach of.

She said: 'He is well aware of the seriousness of the matter. He is aware that it could cross the custodial threshold. Mr Dowd does have some alcohol issues.'

Mr Dowd was released on bail with a condition not to enter any Tesco store. He will be sentenced on January 21 next year.

District Judge Mark Hadfield told him: 'You have pleaded guilty to both offences. Given your previous conviction in court we will have to consider all sentencing options.'

Earlier this week John Ankers, 40, from Hyde, pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour and was fined £110 with £85 costs after causing trouble during the sales. 

He was arrested outside a Tesco store in Hattersley after swinging a punch at police as he tried to buy cheap alcohol.

Police had just advised staff overwhelmed by 300 customers to close the shop just five minutes after its opening to restore order.

But when told by an officer he could not buy anything Ankers retorted: 'Who closed it I bet it was you f***ing lot'.

He then added: 'Do you want a f***ing go, let's have a f***ing fight, that field outside.'

Ankers then swung a fist towards the officer, narrowly missing his head and shouted 'come on then' before being arrested.

A third man is awaiting trial for assault over the disturbances.
