Laura Farrell, 41, (pictured) died in the car crash after Sherri Torkington ran a red light

An angry woman driver killed a wife in a car crash while driving 'aggressively and recklessly' following a screaming row with her boyfriend, a court heard today.

Sheri Torkington, 32, was so angry she jumped a red light at speed and hit Laura Farrell's car as the victim was taking her husband to work in the early hours of the morning, a jury was told.

Mrs Farrell, 41, a HSBC bank worker, suffered fatal injuries in the accident in Bolton, Greater Manchester, and died at the scene.

Her husband Norman, 52, was left with a broken neck, nine broken ribs, a broken collar-bone, three fractures to his pelvis and a punctured lung.

In the minutes before the crash, a witness told the court she saw Torkington 'shouting, screaming and yelling' at her boyfriend Philip Holt at 3am.

The defendant then allegedly got into her Ford Fiesta and drove 'recklessly and aggressively' before crashing less than half an hour later.

'We say the row she had had contributed to the reckless way in which she drove afterwards,' said Darren Preston, prosecuting at Bolton Crown Court.

'This defendant drove a Ford Fiesta through a traffic light which was on red and had been on red for some seconds, at a major and complicated junction, without slowing down or apparently looking at all.

'We say that was driving well below that which would be expected of a reasonable and careful driver and was therefore dangerous.

'Her driving caused a collision between her car and another car, driven by Laura Farrell, which had proceeded through a green light from another side of that junction.

'That collision was of sufficient force that, unfortunately, Laura Farrell lost her life. It was, we say, the dangerous driving of this defendant which caused her death.'

Joan Haslam told the court she woke up on the day of the tragedy, June 29, 2011, to see Mr Holt arguing with a woman for around 10 minutes.

She said they were shouting at each other although she did not know what they were saying.

Mr Preston said: 'She heard shouting and screaming coming from outside. She looked out her window and there she saw a male and a female.

'We say that the female was Holt's girlfriend, the defendant. Mrs Haslam saw her get into the car after Holt walked off and she drove off at speed.'

A second witness, Shaun McGuinness was also at home in bed and heard the argument. He also recognised Mr Holt and also saw the woman speeding off in her car, not slowing down as she drove through the residential street and on to the main road.

The prosecution lawyer added: 'It is clear from this evidence we see that the defendant was angry and aggressive because of the argument she had had she was driving aggressively and recklessly as a result.'

Mrs Farrell was in her black Ford Focus taking her husband to work at a cheese distribution factory where he worked night shifts. Tragedy struck at 3.25am at the junction on Turton Street, Bolton with the A666 St Peters Way .

Mr Farrell who had been in a relationship with Laura for 23 years, but were only married for seven added: 'Laura took the car out of gear, coasting up to the lights which were on red - we must have been travelling at 10mph.

Torkington drove like she was on a 'suicide mission' before ploughing into Mrs Farrell's car at Turton Street, Bolton (pictured)

'The lights started to change as we were about 10 to15 metres away from the lights. I looked to the right and by the time I looked left all I could see was grey and a crunching noise and that's all I remember.'

Mr Farrell woke up in Bolton Royal Hospital to be told his wife had died in the crash. He was in hospital for over a month and now has abscesses on his brain, liver and lung.

He told defence lawyer David Toal that although he was running late for work, his wife was not speeding

'It's not a possibility that the lights were red. She was the perfect driver', added Mr Farrell.

Another witness, Robert Johnston, who saw the collision as he was cycling home from his shift at a bakery in Horwich, said he saw the black car, driven by Mrs Farrell, proceed through the green light.'

He said he then saw Torkington's car arriving suddenly, driving at around 35-45 mph, coming straight through the red light in the middle lane and smashing into the victim's car.

Torkington's car pushed Mrs Farrell's vehicle into the crash barrier and then spun into the middle of the dual carriage way. The cyclist flagged down a taxi and an ambulance was called.

When police arrived, Torkington was still in her vehicle, slumped over the steering wheel but came to screaming her name and that her legs were hurt.

Torkington, of Bolton, who only started driving in September 2010, later denied being angry at the time of the crash.

She told police she had watched Mr Holt play pool at a pub, before heading to another. They returned home around 10.30pm and had a 'minor disagreement' after which she drove him to his daughter's house.

She said that as she approached the traffic lights, they were on amber.

Torkington denies causing death by dangerous driving. The trial continues.
