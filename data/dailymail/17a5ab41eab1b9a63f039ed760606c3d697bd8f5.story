The open letter to a former club has become a recent phenomenon when a player signs for a new side, and West Ham's latest arrival Doneil Henry is no exception.

Henry was under contract at Cypriot side Apollon Limassol before joining the Hammers for an undisclosed fee this month, but the Canada international had spent most of his career at Toronto FC before completing his Upton Park switch.

Now the 21-year-old has sent out an open letter to the club where he started his career thanking them for handing him his professional break.

Henry said: 'Toronto was my first professional club as well as the city in which I grew up in. As I embark on my new challenge at West Ham United, TFC will always have a special place in my heart.

Toronto FC will always be my home! Thanks for all the great memories.'

Henry, who has 14 caps for his country, joins on a long-term contract from Cypriot First Division club Apollon Limassol for an undisclosed fee. 

The 6'2 defender has been closely monitored by the Irons for a while after having already spent two periods training with the club in recent months.

Henry was brought to Upton Park boss Sam Allardyce's attention by Toronto FC head coach Ryan Nelsen.

To my city. 

'Toronto was my first professional club as well as the city in which I grew up in. As I embark on my new challenge at West Ham United, TFC will always have a special place in my heart.

'I would like to thank all the passionate fans for their support and patience, encouraging me as I developed into the player I am today.

'A special thank you to the MLSE organisation, Larry Tanenbaum for his support and kindness, Tim Bezbatchenko and the entire TFC family for giving me all the tools necessary to continue on my journey. West Ham united is a new chapter in my life. 

'Toronto FC will always be my home!

'Thanks for all the great memories,

'Doneil Henry.'

Former defender Nelsen, who played under Allardyce at Blackburn Rovers, recommended the talented Henry after having seen him become the first player to graduate from the MLS side's academy.

'Ryan (Nelsen) was my captain at Blackburn for a couple of years and he rang us and told us about Doneil,' Allardyce told West Ham's official website.

'He said this lad definitely has Premier League potential and he has everything he needs.

'With a little coaching from us and work in terms of how to defend in the Premier League, Ryan says he has all the attributes to be a good player.

'We have invested in him for the near future, so we do hope he can make some sort of appearance this season if he settles in and does as well as Ryan thinks he will. If not, we hope he is certainly one for the future.'
