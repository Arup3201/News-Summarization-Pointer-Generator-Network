Instagram might be known for its tantalising food photos and coffee cup art, but now there is a delicious twist as now you can get your favourite photos printed on real marshmallows.

An innovative new service allows Instagram users to transform their photographic creations into sweets by picking their nine favourite images, which are then used to create a boxful of personalised marshmallows.

The sweets, which measure 4cm by 
4cm, are made by a company called Boomf and are sent by post in a
 box that is cleverly designed to fit though letterboxes.

The company claims to transform photographs into 'multi-sensory delicacies'.

In order to make the mallows, a user can connect their Instagram account to the Boomf website, select nine images and pay £12 for the personalised product, which will be sent though the post to a UK address.

Each marshmallow measures 4cm by 4cm and has an Instagram image printed on top

The company says it can make any scene or object  - no matter how unappetising - edible.

‘Sunsets, kittens, Macchu Picchu, your Auntie Barbara. Devour your mates one by one after dinner, turn your selfies into a romantic gift for your significant other, or roast your ex over a bonfire.’

However, it suggests that the Instagram photos that work best are relatively simple images with good contrast and light backgrounds.

The service is currently only offered via post in the UK and taps into people's Instagram accounts

It recommends choosing an Instagram image with a couple of faces rather than a group shot as the printing quality on a marshmallow is not as good as a photograph and it could come out blurry.

The marshmallows are currently only available in vanilla but the company says it is working on more flavours and that they last for six months after they are delivered.

While the sweets are currently only available in the UK, the firm plans on being able to send them to addresses across the globe next year.

While Instagram users may find it difficult to pick just nine images from the collection of photographs they have taken with the app, a recent video, which is composed of 852 separate photographs, demonstrates that when it comes to our supposedly arty photo compositions, we are not as original as we would like to think.

The film, by Netherlands-based art director Thomas Jullien, includes images of popular Instagram subjects, such as iconic landmarks such as the Empire State Building, the wings of an airplane and sunsets as well as everyday objects like the shoes on our feet.

Together, they demonstrate that people often share images that they find interesting in themselves, despite their familiarity, but are not as ground-breaking as they might imagine.
