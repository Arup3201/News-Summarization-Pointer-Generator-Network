Chelsea are hurrying Atletico Madrid into ratifying Diego Costa's £32million move, fearing the Spanish champions are holding out for a more lucrative offer.

As reported by Sportsmail on Thursday, everything is in place for the Spain international to complete his move to Stamford Brigde.

But Chelsea feel the La Liga club are dragging their heels over completing the deal's formalities in hope of a more substantial offer from a rival club.

Chelsea have already met the player's 
£32million buyout clause meaning there is nothing from preventing the 
move from being rubber-stamped before the World Cup.

And
 Chelsea officials have contacted their Spanish counterparts in an 
attempt to push the deal through as soon as possible. A Chelsea source 
said: 'Chelsea have made an offer to Atletico Madrid in compliance with 
the buyout terms in Diego Costa’s contract, and Chelsea have been 
advised that the player has provided notice to Atletico Madrid invoking 
the buyout clause and directing the club to accept Chelsea’s offer.

'Chelsea
 looks forward to entering into formal transfer documentation with 
Atletico Madrid as soon as possible so that the player can concentrate 
on the World Cup.'
