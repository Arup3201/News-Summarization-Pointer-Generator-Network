Labour has been ahead in the opinion polls since 2011. But it has never taken the commanding lead necessary to be sure of winning the next Election.

Instead, its lead has been narrowing in recent months, and this week saw the publication of the first polls since 2012 showing a Tory lead. 

This comes as no great surprise. It is more of a wonder that Labour had the lead in the first place.Voters have consistently thought David Cameron makes a better prime minister than Ed Miliband would do.

Labour is still being blamed by the electorate for the 2008 financial crisis, which is why Ed Miliband will never move into Number 10 Downing Street

They blame the Labour Party for the 2008 financial crisis, and now that the economy is recovering people have increasing confidence in Conservative  economic management, which they have nearly always preferred to the alternative offered by the two Eds. The diminishing Labour lead is  also unsurprising, because usually governments rally and oppositions fall back in the final months before  a general election.

If past election cycles are a good guide, recent polls suggest the Tories are likely to get the largest share of the vote in 2015, with a two-thirds chance of winning the most seats.

While the chances of another hung parliament or a Tory majority are each about 2 in 5, Labour’s chances of a majority are looking increasingly thin at less than 1 in 5.

The numer of people intending to vote Labour has fallen dramatically since the beginning of the year

But maybe the past is not such a good guide to the future. This time things might be different.

Now that we have the first post-war Coalition government, will both governing parties recover from their mid-term doldrums? While the Liberal Democrats have been flat-lining at about ten per cent, the Tories, as expected, are doing better now than at this time last year. The unprecedented rise of UKIP is also important. For Cameron to recover his mid-term losses he needs to turn around former Tories who have defected to UKIP. Surveys suggest this will be harder in 2015 than it was in 2010.

Cameron’s challenge is on the right. Ed Miliband’s is in the centre. Hanging on to the former Lib Dem voters who switched to Labour after the Coalition formed will be particularly hard in the many constituencies where the Lib Dems, not Labour, are the main competitors for the Tories.

Ultimately though, Miliband’s biggest challenge is to convince more people they want him to be prime minister. After years of the public consistently preferring Cameron, it will be hard to change their minds now.
