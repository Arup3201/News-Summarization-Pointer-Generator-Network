Heather Watson is back playing her best tennis and trying to use the memory of Elena Baltacha as an inspiration to maximise her potential.

After storming through her final qualifying round of the French Open with a 48-minute 6-1 6-1 victory over Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit yesterday morning Watson reflected on the loss of Baltacha, who was buried last Monday after losing her battle against liver cancer.

'It’s so sad. You don’t really believe it that you’ll never see her again. Her funeral was on my birthday and lots of the girls sent me messages. Laura (Robson) was there, Judy (Murray) was there,' said Watson, who was already in Paris.

Sad day: Baltacha was buried on Monday at St Johns Church in Ipswich, attended by friends and family

'I’m just using it as motivation that life is short, you don’t know when it’s going to be your last so just make the most of every day.

'Elena was so feisty on the court. I can picture her now saying, "Come on". I just can’t believe she’s not here any more.'

Aside from that perspective, Watson is grateful that she is in a position to perform properly again, having endured a difficult 2013 which badly stalled her career after being diagnosed with glandular fever in March.

Eyes on the prize: Watson beat Estonia¿s Anett Kontaveit to qualify for the first round of the French Open

The contrast with where she was twelve months ago is striking, as she has now won eight matches in a row after taking the Prague Open title a week ago.

Her reward for making the main draw is a match against Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic, the world number 66, while her fellow qualifier James Ward was given a very tough assignment, against seventeenth seed Tommy Robredo of Spain.

'Twelve months ago I really wasn’t enjoying my tennis,' said Watson. 'I wasn’t feeling great. This was my first tournament back and I wasn’t ready.

'I had practised for three weeks after not playing for two and a half months and also I couldn’t do too much fitness because I wasn’t ready for that physically, it went into a downward spiral of not winning matches and losing confidence and I learned a lot from that.

'For example I got injured again this year with my ribs and I really wanted to play Estoril, it’s one of my favourite tournaments of the year because my best friend lives there. 

'I thought to myself "You know what I’m not ready" and I thought I’d give myself that extra week to come back the next week, because coming back too soon is not the right decision. If I lose one week it will be better than losing months.

'I wasn’t winning much at all and now I’m playing the best tennis of my career and I’m loving it. I’m not getting tired. I’ve played so many matches in a row and I’m  taking nothing for granted.

'I’m just really enjoying, I’m enjoying matches, practice, stretching after and the physio and all of it.'

Revitalised: Watson (left) has praised coach Diego Veronelli (right) for her more attacking outlook on the court

Watson has changed her playing philosophy in consultation with her new coach of this year, Argentinian Diego Veronelli, taking on a far more attacking outlook.

'Before, even when I reached my highest ranking I was a kind of counter puncher on important points I’d wait for my opponent to miss or hope for them to miss, now as soon as I see a short ball I want to win the point.'
