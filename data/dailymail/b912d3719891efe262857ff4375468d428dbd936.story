Even though he is the odd one out, this baby albino monkey has no qualms about taking on a buddy twice his size for a playful wrestling match.

The squabble was caught on camera by a holidaymaker in Kruger National Park in South Africa.

Despite looking a little different to his fellow primates, the albino vervet monkey ended up on top after the tiff.

Take that: A rare albino vervet monkey was spotted wrestling with one of its older friends in Kruger National Park, South Africa

The unique animal was spotted by a 
group of tourists after jumping out from some nearby undergrowth into 
the group of monkeys in Kruger National Park in South Africa.

Photographer,
 Christy Strever, managed to get a picture of the pasty primate after it
 jumped straight into to her line of vision whilst photographing the 
troop of monkeys.

Rarely 
seen in the wild, albino animals are often put at a disadvantage due to 
their lack of camouflage and can become an obvious target for predators.

Ms Strever said ‘I was busy photographing the vervet monkeys when this little 
white bombshell dives out of the bushes and tackles another baby vervet 
around the same age.'

Ouch! The older vervet monkey nearly lifts the little albino off the ground as it makes a move during their wrestling match

Go on then, buddy: The tiny albino takes a step back to prepare its retaliation swing

Ka-paow! The monkey shows its much larger opponent that you shouldn't mess with the little ones as it punches it straight in the eye

‘It was
 very cute to watch them all playing, I couldn't take my eyes off them, 
luckily it jumped straight into shot so I noticed it straight away.

‘The group didn't behave differently towards the little monkey and it was obvious they treated it equally as one of their own.

‘The
 only difference was that it seemed a little more shy than the others at
 times and stayed near the protection of the grass and trees.

Got ya! It may be smaller and look a little different, but there is no questioning who is top monkey here

Pri-mates: The battle has been won, and the two monkeys go back to playfully scuffling

‘The
 monkey really stood out amongst the group, it was pure white against 
the grey monkeys, it reminded me a miniature abominable snowman.

‘I
 was on holiday with aunt and uncle at the time and it was our last day 
in the Kruger National Park.

'It was a very unique sighting and seeing 
the rare monkey was brilliant end to a great trip.’
