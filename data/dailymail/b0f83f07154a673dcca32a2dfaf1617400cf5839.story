'Fading away': Anne Todd, 71, was a healthy size 12 and weighed nine stone when she suddenly stopped eating for no apparent reason

A grandmother-of-three is slowly starving to death after suddenly refusing to eat food and losing half her body weight in just three months.

Anne Todd, 71, was a healthy size 12 and weighed nine stone in November but her weight has since plunged to four stone and nine pounds in the space of a few months.

Her distraught daughter Jackie Nelson, 46, revealed how her mother was active and healthy when she suddenly stopped going and started to refuse to eat.

Mrs Todd has undergone checks by her GP, doctors, social services and a community mental health team but none have been able to explain the cause and say they cannot force her to eat.Â 

Her daughter has now released images of her ailing 
mother in the hopes of discovering what may be the cause of her mother's sudden change.

Mrs Nelson, from Nelson, Lancashire, said: 'We are in 2014. In this day and age people should not be starving to death.

'She wouldn't look out of place in Belsen. I am at my wit's end.

'It's
 like seeing a ghost. I just feel like she's going to die a slow and 
painful death unless she gets the help that she needs.'

Mrs Todd told how her mother had been active and outgoing but suddenly stopped going out and refused to eat.

She said: 'It happened so suddenly it was almost like someone had flicked a switch and she stopped eating.

'I don't think she eats a thing when she's at home and it's so upsetting to see her waste away. I'm watching her starve to death and I can't do anything to help her.

'Prior to that she had been quite active but she stopped eating and she stopped going out. Since then she's getting worse.'

Mrs Todd has been taken to hospital five times since she stopped eating but doctors say she has no physical illness.

'Starving to death': Anne Todd, 71, pictured in hospital, has lost half her bodyweight in three months. Doctors and social workers have been unable to find a cause for why she suddenly stopped eating

She refused to celebrate Christmas at 
her daughter's house as usual and by February 9 her condition had 
deteriorated so much that her daughter was forced to call ambulance.

Mrs Todd was taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital where she stayed for 10 days and underwent a series of tests - with no clear results.

Mrs Nelson, a mother-of-two, has been off work due to stress over the situation and regularly takes cooked meals to mother which are left untouched.

She added: 'I don't know what's caused this but there's been no real changes in her life to spark anything.

Looking for answers: Jackie Nelson, 46, is trying to find out why her mother suddenly stopped eating

'Her partner died nine years ago and she's lived on her own since then and got along just fine.

'I think maybe it's some sort of mental illness. The doctors have looked at whether she's got depression or the onset of dementia but then, when they assessed her, they said she's fine.

'It can't be a physical thing because she eats fine when she's in hospital but she'll probably be released in a few days and once she's home the cycle starts again.

'Because the doctors don't know what's wrong, they can't treat her.

'One doctor actually said to me that if she doesn't want to eat then that's up to her.

'I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall and nobody is listening.

'The longer it takes for her to get the help she so desperately needs, the thinner she's getting. She's just skin and bone.'

Following Mrs Todd's last hospital visit, a care package was implemented but Mrs Nelson said that has not not helped.

She added: 'She has carers going in to see her but she is still refusing to eat and they can't force her.

'It's not their fault but everyone seems to be passing the buck. The care system is so difficult to navigate.

'You don't have to be medically trained to see that there is something seriously wrong with my mum.

'When she was admitted to hospital the nurses were aghast at how emaciated she was.

Mystery: Doctors carried out a series of tests on Mrs Todd, pictured before her weightloss when she was a healthy size 12, but could find nothing wrong her

'We keep being pushed from pillar to post and now it's got to crisis point. Somebody needs to get to the bottom of it before it's too late.'

Rosehill Surgery in Burnley where Mrs Todd is registered as a patient said they could not comment because of patient confidentiality.

Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust said: 'When a person is discharged from hospital, the Trust works closely with the individual and family to ensure that a suitable package of care is in place.

'The Trust adopts a person-centred care approach which supports individuals and helps them to make informed decisions and manage their own health care.'
