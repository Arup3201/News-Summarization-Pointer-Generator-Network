The £4billion Premier League TV rights tender goes into a second round on Tuesday morning with revised bids due by midday. The seven packages are expected to be awarded later in the day.

Although the Discovery Channel and beIN Sport have shown interest, the most likely scenario is that Sky will retain four prime packages.

BT, meanwhile, will get an increased number of games, up to 56 out of the 168 live matches being sold per season for three years. 

Competition from Discovery Communications and beIN Sports could the push price per match to £8m

Overall, the likely cost will be around £8m per game.

However, Sky retaining the 4pm Sunday slot package, which has the most first picks attached to it, will allow them to dominate the choice of games as they have done since the start of the Barclays Premier League.

The bids were tabled for the seven packages - starting in 2016-17 - by a noon deadline on Friday, but there was no immediate verdict from the Premier League, as there was a week earlier for the highlights rights won by BBC.

Who will be bidding in the auction for domestic live rights to the Premier League?

Sky and BT, who currently share coverage, will both be involved again. They paid £3.018billion between them for the 2013-16 rights. That is expected to rise for 2016-19, and potentially soar to £4bn if other serious bidders enter the auction, such as US-based giant Discovery Communications and Qatar-owned beIN Sports.

Will Sky lose matches this time?

It’s feasible. Under the current deals, Sky have 116 live games per season, and BT have the other 38 games, for a total of 154 live games per season, which were sold in seven packages.

The auction for 2016-19 also has seven packages for sale but more games overall. Five packages have 28 games per season and two packages have 14 games. About a dozen of the extra games will be shown on Friday nights.

Sky has dominated the showing of live games since the inception of the Premier League in 1992

Any one broadcaster will be allowed a maximum of 126 games per season — or four ‘big’ packages plus one ‘small’ package. That’s what Sky currently has and will want to keep. They will almost certainly be willing to pay more than the £2.28bn over three years they paid last time.

But will another major player splash the cash and reduce what Sky have? BT have deep pockets. They spent £897m on Champions League and Europa League live rights for three seasons starting 2015-16. They won’t want less than the 38 PL games they have now and can be expected to bid strongly.

The real unknown is whether Discovery and beIN Sports will come in with blockbuster bids. That could blow the market open and send prices soaring, again.

Who are Discovery Communications and what personalities might we see on our TVs if a new bidder wins the rights to Premier League matches?

Discovery are a US-based global media company that started in the 1980s with one documentary channel. They are now extremely wealthy and own a majority stake in Eurosport. Their chief executive was reportedly in London last month to meet Premier League officials for talks about a bid for UK rights.

If Discovery win the rights to some matches the assumption is they would show them on British Eurosport, which has never televised live Premier League games. They would try to hire or poach established names, possibly from Sky or BT if those two lose games. beIN Sports already have former Sky frontmen Richard Keys and Andy Gray working for them in Qatar.

Why is there such fierce competition for Premier League games?

A generation ago virtually nobody in Britain paid to watch TV over and above their licence fee. Now around 60 per cent of households (or 16m homes) pay for a subscription whether Sky, Virgin or BT.

Increasingly, the battle between these communications giants is for the ‘triple play’ market (phone, internet and TV from one source) and the ‘quad play’ market (which adds mobile phones).

They want you to get all your services from them. Live Premier League matches are being used in an attempt to influence your choice. With millions of people paying £600-plus a year for these services, it’s a massive industry.

If another broadcaster enters the arena, TV fans may find they have to pay for another subscription 

Will Premier League football cost me more from 2016-17? Will I need more subscriptions?

It’s feasible that Sky and BT will share the rights again in broadly the same way they do now, and fans won’t notice any difference to pricing. But if a third or even fourth broadcaster gets involved more subscriptions will be needed, almost certainly at extra cost. Although if Sky lose a lot of games they may have to reduce prices to keep customers.

Will the clubs get richer?

Oh yes. The total broadcasting pot for the 2013-16 period was more than £5.5bn, mostly from domestic live rights (£3.018bn) and foreign rights (£2.23bn) with highlights, near-live rights and mobile rights on top.

The 2016-19 total pot is expected to be close to £7bn with £4bn from domestic rights. The vast bulk of the cash will end up being split among the Premier League clubs.

Will ticket prices go down?

You’re having a laugh, aren’t you? Almost certainly not and not by much in any case.

Many Premier League games are sold out or nearly sold out, even though ticket prices are the most expensive in the world. While the demand is there, clubs will charge what they can.

The only rider to that is that the Premier League hierarchy would like to see clubs offer more cheap deals, particularly to away fans and younger people. It remains possible that an increase in TV money will allow more subsidies for schemes like this... but don’t bank on it.
