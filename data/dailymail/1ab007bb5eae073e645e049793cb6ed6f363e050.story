 A 19-year-old up-and-coming kicker from Oregon's Williamette University has become the first active college football player to come out as gay.

Conner Mertens, a redshirt freshman kicker at Division III Willamette announced Tuesday that he's bisexual at a news conference on Tuesday.

Mertens announced his sexual orientation to his teammates during a meeting on Monday. 'It got to a point where I just got tired
 of it, trying to hide who I was and trying to pretend I was something I
 was not,' he said.

Brave decision: Willamette University football player Conner Mertens holds a press conference announcing he came out as bisexual to his team

He approached his coach Glen Fowles after requesting a meeting. Fowles was fearful the talented player would announce he was transferring to another college.

Instead, he asked Fowles if he believes Merten is a good kicker. Fowles said yes.

'He then asked if his role on the team would be affected by things he did off the field, or if he’d be judged by his performance. All that mattered to Fowles was whether he could kick that ball through those two goal posts. That was reassuring, Mertens said, because he had something very personal to share with his coach,' reports Outsports.com.

'I’m bisexual,' Mertens told Fowles. 'I like dudes. I have a boyfriend. And next week, I’m going to tell the world.'

Ending stigma: Mertens announced Tuesday that he is bisexual, saying he was tired of pretending he was something he wasn't and that he also wants to help dispel the stereotypes and stigmas associated with bisexual athletes

Speaking on campus later Tuesday afternoon, Mertens said he hopes his announcement helps dispel the stereotypes and stigmas associated with bisexual athletes - and in turn let other LGBT athletes know they are not alone.

'You can be real and you can be yourself,' Mertens said. 'That only starts when you can love yourself and let others love you. That's kind of where I was going with this.'

Bearcats coach Glen Fowles said the players were overwhelmingly supportive of his decision.

'It's been great to see the way our guys have rallied around,' Fowles said. 'For our guys, Conner is just a kicker.'

Team captain and junior inside linebacker Jack Nelson said: 'It wasn't a big deal and we were glad he felt comfortable to tell us.'

Response: 'Death threats and people telling me to kill myself? Dang...guess I'm doing something right,' tweeted Mertens Wednesday

While several LGBT athletes have come out, including former NBA player Jason Collins, WNBA star Brittney Griner and Major League Soccer player Robbie Rogers, it's believed that Mertens is the first active college football player at any level to publicly announce his bisexuality.

Willamette issued a statement supporting Mertens' decision, saying the university 'respects his contribution to a more humane and just world.'

Fowles joked about how Mertens first approached him: 'He says, "Coach, I'm really going to utilize this open door policy."'

Mertens, who told his family just after Christmas, said he was humbled by the response.

'They thought I got a speeding ticket,' Mertens said reports Outsports.com. 'They were originally pretty shocked but have since showed me so much love and support.'

Truth: The popular player dated girls throughout high school, keeping his attracting to other men hidden until now

'It sounds corny, but I legitimately feel there's a weight off my shoulders. It's tiring to pretend your something else for 24-seven, for 18 or 19 years of your life,' he said.

'So finally to be able to joke about it, to be honest about it, not have to put on this mask, I'm finally able to take a deep breath.'

The Bearcats play in the Northwest Conference. The team went 7-2 overall last season and finished third in the league at 4-2.

Mertens did not play his freshman season because he hurt his left knee while playing soccer. He will compete with two other kickers on the Bearcats' roster.

The response to Mertens' revelation has been overwhelmingly positive, but predicably, detractors and internet trolls have contributed their opinions.

Grace: Mertens has responded to detractors with kindness and forgiveness, despite the vitriol directed at him

'Westboro Baptist Church will picket @willamette_u next time we’re in the area. You’re going to hell, Merts! #RepentOrPerish,' tweeted the notoriously bigoted Westboro Baptist Church.

Mertens responded with grace, tweeting, 'I'm sorry to hear you feel that way. Wish you all the best. God is love my friends.'

Mertens, who comes from the conservative town of Kennewick, Washington, aims to help others struggling with the same issue.

On Monday evening, he tweeted a letter he wrote to his hometown. An excerpt reads:

'Throughout my life, I have been told who I can and cannot be. A few months ago I realized that I am only limited as a person by the limitations I have placed on myself. That being said, it is important to me to tell you all that I, Conner Mertens, am bisexual. If that makes you uncomfortable, I refuse to apologize for being who I am.'
