It's the exclusive new club for men with one  strict membership requirement.

They have to prove their manhood is at least seven inches long.

The Brisbane-based club dubbed 'The 7th' went live with its website on Thursday and claims to already have 12 members.

They boast that only men that belong in the 'top 7th percentile world-wide' are able to join the so-called club and those who meet the seven inch criteria are given a silver ring to confirm their membership.

A Brisbane-based club dubbed 'The 7th' that went live with its website on Thursday asks members to prove their manhood is at least seven inches to receive a silver membership ring

'Until now... it hasn't been verifiable on sight if a gentleman has the capacity to fulfil a natural desire and preference that cannot be compensated for,' they said.

While it isn't clear if The 7th is some sort of stunt, its website does lay out how people can join.

'Members are posted an initiation pack containing a set of uniquely coded documents,' the website reads.

'The pack allows members to securely upload qualification photos whilst maintaining discretion so that The 7th may assess and award them status.

'Only those who qualify will be granted a ring.'

The 7th have been posting photos of events on its Instagram (pictured) and held a launch party for the new exclusive club on Wednesday night in Brisbane

They claim 'empowering endowed men' with an exclusive membership ring allows it to serve as the 'modern symbol of a gentleman'

They claim 'empowering endowed men' with an exclusive membership ring allows it to serve as the 'modern symbol of a gentleman'. 

The 7th says its members embrace seven different values - respect, integrity, loyalty, honour, duty, innovation and vision.

They say they want to re-empower these values in today’s digital era where people don't have intimacy and are disconnected from each other.

People who see and promote the values, but do not physically qualify can still be associated with The 7th via an ambassador program

'To do this, we chose to focus on something that is at the very core of our nature and so centric to human relationships,' they said.

'One which we subconsciously already accept, but is a social taboo: the endowment of a man.'  

People who see and promote the values, but do not physically qualify can still be associated with The 7th via an ambassador program. 

'Any member of the public, regardless of endowment or gender may become an ambassador and for introducing three qualifying members can be a part of The 7th,' they said.
