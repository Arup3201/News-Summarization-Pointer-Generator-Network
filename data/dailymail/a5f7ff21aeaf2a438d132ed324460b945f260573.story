However, florists say artificial flowers have greatly improved in recent years, with new, realistic designs. They use them in weddings and high-end events, with displays made to look and feel exactly like freshly-cut stems.

So, is it really possible to fake a good bouquet?

I challenged leading florist Andrew Devonport, co-owner and creative director of London’s Wildabout Flowers, to make up three identical pairs of Mother’s Day arrangements — one real, one fake — to see if I could tell the real blooms from their silk stand-ins ...
