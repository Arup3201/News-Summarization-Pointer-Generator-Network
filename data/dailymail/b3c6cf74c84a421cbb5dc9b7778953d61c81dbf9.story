Confession: Ukip councillor Malcolm Small, pictured arriving at court, admitted one count of arson after burning his wife's clothes

A Ukip councillor is expected to resign after being handed a 12-week suspended prison sentence for burning his wife's clothes during a petty row.

Malcolm Small, 48, grabbed a handful of 'treasured items' belonging to Kim Van Opdorp and set them alight in the back garden of their marital home.

The couple - who had been in a relationship for ten years - had argued about who they wanted to join them as guests at a Mayor's Ball that coming weekend.

The gown and tuxedo they were due to wear at the event were among the £2,000 worth of clothing burned, Basingstoke Magistrates' Court heard.

Miss Van Opdorp moved out of the home to stay with friends following the row and found her clothing had been destroyed when she returned to collect it.

Prosecutor Kate Prince said there had been a history of domestic violence between the couple, who are now divorcing.

She said: 'On this occasion, while Mr Small was out of the property, she returned to the home address to collect some of her items.

'When she checked in the wardrobe, she found all her items had been removed, apart from her wedding dress and her winter coat.

'Treasured items, including a nightie belonging to her grandmother and a ball dress she was due to wear that Friday night, had been burned in the garden at the back of the property.

'Mr Small admitted he had done it because he was angry and he did not look to see what it was he was taking.

'Ms Van Opdorp is not able to say exactly how much the items are worth but it is thought to be thousands, probably £2,000.'

Ruth Cassidy, defending, said Small is suffering from depression and has struggled to cope with the fact their relationship has come to an end.

She said: 'Mr Small does not agree with the value. Miss Van Opdorp had packed her bag and taken her main clothes to her friend's.

'He says it was only a few odds and ends left and she bought relatively cheap clothes.'

She added: 'He says he did it in a complete moment of rage. He just saw red.

'Immediately on seeing the flames he felt remorseful. It was irrational.

'He was careful to burn the items on a palette outside, and tidied up after.'

Resignation: Small, 48, is expected to resign from Rushmoor Borough Council after being sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 24 months

Small, from Farnborough in Hampshire, was elected to Rushmoor Borough Council as a member of the West Heath ward in 2012 for a three-year term.

But the court heard the council's chief executive had warned him he would have to quit if he was given a custodial sentence.

Small admitted one charge of arson at his home on February 4 this year.

He sat grim-faced in the dock as magistrates jailed him for 12 weeks, suspended for 24 months, and gave him a 24 month supervision order.

The politician, who also runs a hot dog business, must attend 32 sessions of a building better relationships programme.

He was given a 24-month restraining order, banning him from contacting Ms Van Opdorp, other than through a solicitor.

And he was ordered to pay £85 costs and £80 into a fund for victims of crime.

Small today refused to comment as he left court.
