Aged 15, tipping the scales at just 7st 10lb at 5ft 1" tall, Emma Stewart had the sort of slim figure that many young women would envy.

But it wasn't enough for her and under pressure to slim for a holiday, the sensitive teenager's body worries spiralled out of control.

A battle with anorexia blighted her life for the next eight years and at one point the damaged girl weighed a terrifying 4st 7lb.

But 10 years on, Emma, who hails from Elgin in Scotland, is healthy and happy again, and puts the turnaround down to her 'miracle' daughter, two-year-old Kacy.

Trigger: Emma on the Greek holiday that kickstarted her descent into eight years of anorexic hell

'I feel so lucky to be alive and to have such a beautiful little girl,' the mother-of-one told the Daily Mirror. 'I've lost friends to this illness [anorexia] and while I know I'll never be free of those anorexic feelings, I only have to look at Kacy and I feel strong. She helped me more than any doctor could.'

At her lowest point Emma's weight plummeted to just 4st 7lb while she eked out an existence on a single apple and 150 laxatives a day.

Even when warned by a doctor that she was ruining her health and could die, she still couldn't see sense and had to be referred to an eating disorders unit.

She admits that she didn't listen to the doctors because all she cared about was being skinny.

She had always wanted to to be a mother but the thought of getting pregnant and putting on weight was terrifying.

It wasn't until she realised that her friends and family truly thought she wouldn't survive that she started to pull back from the brink.

Spurred on by friends and her worried parents, she slowly put on weight, eventually tipping the scales at a healthy 8st.

After moving into her own flat, she met a roofer named David, now 26, who gave her the confidence to end the occasional bouts of bingeing and purging that still plagued her.

'I was still having bad days,' she says. 'But David made me more accepting of my body. We were so happy and moved in together. The only thing missing was a baby.'

But Emma feared that having a child might never be a possibility for her, thanks to the damage caused by years of living with an eating disorder.

'I'd been taking 150 laxatives a day at one point,' she adds. 'It was obvious that my body couldn't cope with a baby.'

Happily, fate had a wonderful surprise in store and just months later, Emma discovered that she was pregnant.

But her old fears still plagued her, and she admits that she was terrified of putting on weight.

She still made herself sick on some days but with David supporting her every step of the way Emma managed to take control of her demons and by the time daughter Kacy was born, Emma weighed a normal 11st 7lbs.

Suddenly Kacy was her priority, rather then her body, as she focused on being a good mother.

And two years on, she adds: 'Whenever I get tempted not to eat, I look at Kacy and the longing to purge or starve myself goes. Kacy truly has saved my life.'
