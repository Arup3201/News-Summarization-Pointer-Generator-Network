A television advert for a payday loan company featuring three dancing women dressed in Austrian clothing has been banned for trivialising the practice of borrowing money to buy a car.

Two adverts for Loans 2 Go were investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority following a complaint that were 'socially irresponsible' for using light-hearted methods to convince borrowers to take out a payday loan rather than seek less drastic measures to raise money.

The regulator found Loans to Go to be in breach of social responsibility laws, saying the 'celebratory atmosphere' the advert created was in contrast to the serious business of taking out a loan.

Banned: Loans 2 Go were condemned for 'trivialising' money lending through humorous advertising. One of their adverts featured women dancing in traditional Austrian clothing dancing around an ice cream van

The Advertising Standards Authority said Loans 2 Go breached its code of conduct by taking an overly casual attitude to taking out a loan, adding that although the advert explicitly stated the terms and conditions of borrowing money, it did so against a 'jolly, light-hearted and humorous' backdrop which failed to properly highlight the potential consequences.

The first advert shows a man standing in his 
driveway with a for sale sign on his car as another man 
dressed in lederhosen plays the accordion in front of him.

A
 voiceover then says: 'Out of cash? Selling your car to make ends meet?', at which point the costumed man begins singing: 'For cash today, use Loans 2 Go, you 
still get to keep your car' to the tune of 'For He's a Jolly Good Fellow'.

The voiceover adds 'Take out a logbook loan on the car you own' as three women, also dressed in traditional Austrian clothing, start dancing around the car.

Serious business: The Advertising Standards Authority said the 'jolly, light-hearted and humorous' were in contrast to the true nature of borrowing money and condemend the 'celebratory atmosphere'

Upbeat: One person complained that the adverts were 'socially irresponsible' for trivialising loans. The Advertising Standards Authority said they must not be broadcast again in their current form

A number of short-term loan companies have come in for criticism in recent years, and there been discussions in the House of Commons over the best way to keep them in check.

In 2008 money education charity Credit Action complained to the Office of Fair Trading saying lenders breached regulations while targeting potential customers on Facebook. The main complaint was that the APR was not displayed prominently, as is required by UK regulations.

In 2010 pressure group Compass organised a campaign to ‘end legal loan sharking’’ which saw over 200 MPs sign an Early Day Motion by April the following year.

Payday lender Wonga has faced widespread criticism over interest rates, debt collection methods and its £24 million sponsorship of Newcastle United, which critics say could tempt impressionable young fans into debt.

Earlier this year the Advertising Standards Authority criticised Cash Lady for implying payday loans could fund a celebrity lifestyle.

The ASA has since been banned the company from using Kerry Katona in advertising, saying she was too heavily associated with debt.

The accordion player then hands the 
borrower a wad of £20 notes as on-screen text appears, stating: 'Loans 
secured on your vehicle. Subject to value of vehicle, proof of income, 
status and availability.'

It
 added that the deal was dependent on the seller providing a logbook, 
MOT, insurance details - and that the payback was based on an APR of 
356.3 per cent.

In the second advert an ice cream van seller is shown in his van as a voiceover says: 'Out of cash? Your business needs a helping hand?'

The lederhosen-clad man and women then reappear, dancing around the ice cream van as the ice cream vendor is handed a wad of cash.

One person complained that the two adverts were socially irresponsible by trivialising the nature of taking out a secured loan on your vehicle.

The Advertising Standards Authority subsequently banned the adverts, saying they must not be broadcast again in their current form.

Describng the reasons for the ban, it stated: 'We noted the jingle used in both ads was catchy and upbeat, that it was likely to be recognised by many viewers as the tune of 'For he's a jolly good fellow', and that during both ads, men and women were seen dressed up in lederhosen dancing, singing and smiling while both drivers were handed a wad of bank notes.'

Light-hearted: Throughout the adverts men are handed wads of money as jovial music is played and a voiceover says money can be borrowed against the value of a car

The Authority added: 'We considered 
that the overall atmosphere of both ads was jolly, light-hearted and 
humorous, in contrast to the serious nature of the business of taking 
out a loan.'

'We noted that 
the ads explained the men needed a loan to help with a financial 
shortfall, portrayed taking out credit as a one-off and stated 
explicitly that loans were subject to proof of income, but due to the 
celebratory atmosphere of the ads and the lack of emphasis on the 
potential consequences of taking out a loan, we felt the ads trivialised
 and presented a casual attitude to taking out a loan,' they said.

The Advertising Standards Authority said it told Loans 2 Go Ltd to ensure all future advertising complied with the relevant consumer credit legislation and was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and society.'

Bosses at Loans 2 Go Ltd admitted the APR should have been given greater prominence, but insisted it was a cheaper rate than other providers.

They agreed that the adverts were 'light-hearted and humorous' but said that was to help consumers familiarise themselves with the Loans 2 Go brand.

The added that the ads 'reflected real-life situations that Loans 2 Go said their customers faced, and the ads were pitched in that context' and that they did not 'trivialize the nature of taking out a loan'.
