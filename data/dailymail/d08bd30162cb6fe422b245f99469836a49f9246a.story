In what was one of the closest Presidential races in American history, it was a public relations gamble that may well have tipped the balance - had it ever been shown.

But this video for Gerald Ford's 1976 election campaign against Jimmy Carter was shelved because it was deemed to shocking to air to a country still fragile from JFK's assassination, Vietnam and the Watergate scandal.

In the five-minute clip, Ford, who survived two assassination attempts himself, is seen giving a speech when a cherry bomb goes off.

Believing it was a gun shot, he flinches - but then calmly continues with barely a quiver in his voice.

Fear factor: Ford, who survived two assassination attempts during his tenure, flinches during the speech after a cherry bomb goes - but calmly continues when he realises it is not a gun shot

The video then cuts to him parading through Dallas in an open-top car in very similar fashion to JFK when he was shot dead in the same city 13 years before.

At that point, a narrator says: 'Neither the cherry bombs of a misguided prankster nor all the memories of recent years can keep people and their President apart.

'When a limousine can parade openly through the streets of Dallas, there's a change that's come over America.'

Ford's media team hoped it would 
emphasise that the incumbent had indeed healed an embattled country in 
the two years since taking office.

But when it was shown to a focus group, it became apparent that it had gone too far.

Recalling the viewing, pollster Bob Teeter later recalled that 'it was shocking to them'.

'It was just too emotional.... it was just frightening.' he added.

Some in Ford's inner circle feared the subject matter was still too raw for the American people and that it would particularly harm the campaign in Texas.

As it turned out, Ford lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter, who secured 50.1 per cent of the vote to his 48 per cent.

Presidential historian Michael Beschloss noted on PBS Newshour, that with such tight margins, the video had the potential to swing the result the other way.

He said: 'I found it emotionally 
powerful. I think it would have been even more affecting, had it aired 
as planned, in that national atmosphere 13 years after President 
Kennedy's murder and in the immediate wake of America's traumas over 
Vietnam, urban riots, campus demonstrations and Watergate.

'Especially since it advertises a President not known for his emotional appeal, the commercial does an impressive job of presenting, on an emotional level, the best case for Ford's election - that he had healed a ravaged country.'

He adds that it 'might conceivably (along with so many other factors) have changed the result of that year's Presidential race'.

As vice-president, Ford found himself thrust into the Presidential office in 1974 after the resignation of Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal.

He had been charged with restoring trust in the government, which many feel he succeeded in doing.

At the Ford's funeral in 2007, former president George W Bush said: 'In President Ford, the world saw the best of America and America found a man whose character and leadership would bring calm and healing to one of the most divisive moments in our nation's history.'

But six months after taking office, Ford pardoned Nixon for his part in the cover-up of the burglary at Democratic Party HQ in the Watergate building - a move some believe ultimately cost him the 1976 election.

Ford died on Boxing Day in 2006 at the age of 93.
