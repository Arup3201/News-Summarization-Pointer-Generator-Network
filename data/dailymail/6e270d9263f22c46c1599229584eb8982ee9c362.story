Revelation: Bernard Gray, chief of defence material, enjoyed a chauffeur-driven car and trips abroad

A leading figure in the Ministry of Defence has claimed more than £100,000 expenses in his first year of work, it has been revealed.

Bernard Gray, who was appointed to help manage the budget, enjoyed 106 stays in London and Bristol hotels, for £23,000, despite his home being less than a 60-mile drive from both.

He was also given an official car and chauffeur, costing the department £65,531.

Official documents, seen by the Sunday People, reveal he also spent £17,929 on planes and trains, and £280 in taxis in 2011-2012.

In the months since, he has spent £14,457 travelling abroad.

Mr Gray, who earns £220,00 a year as Chief of Defence Material, was taken on in 2010 to help target waste in the department.

But the former journalist, who was a defence advisor for Tony Blair's administration, spent a third of his nights between January and October 2011 in hotels.

Although the official limit on London hotel stays for civil servants is £135 a night, Mr Gray has been a guest at the £360-a-night, five-star Sofitel London St James hotel in Pall Mall.

The details follow news earlier this month that MoD officials collectively spent £110million on hotels between 2009 and 2013, a further £69million on cars, and £3,000 on Sky Sports.

Andrew Manley, chief executive of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, claimed £5,500 for nearly 50 nights at the luxury New Hall Hotel and Spa in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands.

Mr Manley, also paid around £200,000 a year,  spent 47 nights at the
 £155-a-night, four star spa, despite it being less than two miles from 
DIO headquarters which the MoD said he visited from his London office.

The Sky Sports contract was bought for one small unit in Northwood, 
Hertfordshire, so that it could monitor 'global 24-hour news feeds'.

The revelations have sparked outrage as the Ministry of Defence prepares to cut billions of pounds in their budget, and make thousands of servicemen redundant.

It is the biggest cut to the armed forces since the end
 of the Second World War, with troop numbers being reduced, pay being 
cut, and tanks, jets and warships being scrapped.

And around 20,000 civil servants lost their jobs in 2011.

Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'It beggars belief that someone charged with cutting waste and saving money is racking up such eye-wateringly large expenses bills for travel and accommodation.

'Ordinary taxpayers cannot claim the cost of their journey from home into the office, so why should it be any different for highly-paid civil servants?

'While security considerations may sometimes dictate Mr Gray's travel arrangements, he and his colleagues have a duty to taxpayers to keep these bills to a minimum.'

An MoD spokesman said: 'Travel is an essential part of MoD business, 
either to Defence sites across the UK and overseas, or to hold meetings 
with Government and military officials.

'As has been pointed out 
many times, to fulfil his responsibilities as CDM Bernard Gray is 
required to travel within the UK and overseas, including regular 
journeys between Bristol and London, which inevitably incurs a cost.

'But the MOD has made significant savings of around £53million in the last year alone to ensure resources are directed to the front line.'
