For 42 years, she has reigned supreme in the world of lookalikes.

But now, after a globe-trotting career that has seen her appear in Hollywood films and mix with showbusiness royalty, Jeannette Charles is finally hanging up her crown.

Before she waves her last regal wave and retires, however, the 86-year-old wants to share some treasured memories of her life impersonating Her Majesty.

Flicking through her photo albums during an audience with her at her home is a bizarre experience. There she is with Mohammed Ali, playfully landing a punch on ‘the greatest’s’ chin. Turn the page, and there’s George Hamilton next to her.

Who’s next? David Bailey. And look, that’s Mike Myers of Austin Powers fame. No one, it seems, could resist the opportunity to pose for a snap with ‘the Queen’.

Wayne Rooney, Gary Lineker and Noel Edmonds also got in on the act.

For Mrs Charles was the doyenne of the double-take brigade, the greatest pretender of them all.

She was the first woman to turn her striking resemblance to the monarch into a career, and in her heyday the most famous lookalike in the world.

It all began when she had a portrait of herself painted to give to her late husband Kenneth as a birthday present in 1971.

She spotted an advert placed in her local newspaper by an artist, who by coincidence also wrote a column in the paper and remarked in it at the similarity between mother-of-three Mrs Charles and the Queen.

‘The next thing I knew, the phone was ringing from media across the world all wanting to interview me,’ said Mrs Charles, of Danbury, near Chelmsford, Essex.

‘I thought it’d be a nine-day wonder, but then I was interviewed by Russell Harty on his TV chat show and it snowballed.’

She was invited to open shops, appeared on children’s programmes and began appearing in comedy sketches, including the Two Ronnies.

Her movie credits include The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash (1978) with Eric Idle, The Naked Gun (1988) with Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley, and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) with Mike Myers, Beyonce and Michael Caine.

‘I never knew that some of the people I worked with on films were so well known,’ she said. ‘When I met Mike Myers I thought he was an electrician on the set. Of course, I knew who Michael Caine was and was excited when he watched me perform one day.’

Once she was invited to Las Vegas by Liberace to the opening of his restaurant. ‘He hugged me and said he enjoyed royalty,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t believe it.’

Despite the comedic value of her appearances, Mrs Charles has a deep respect for the Royal Family.

She said: ‘The Queen is absolutely amazing and I have nothing but respect and admiration for her and the Royal Family. They are the heart of this country.’

Asked if she has ever met the Queen, she said: ‘I never talk about that,’ but added: ‘The Queen is funny too, she has got a sense of humour.’

Mrs Charles turned down roles which she felt were disrespectful – including, she claims, one in the Ali G movie with Sacha Baron Cohen.

‘He wanted the Queen’s knickers to fall down as she got in a limo, but I drew the line at that,’ she said.

Two years younger than the real Queen, she is withdrawing from the limelight after a battle with arthritis.

Reflecting on her career, Mrs Charles said: ‘I really will miss it. People always ask me what the highlight has been, but honestly every time I did something, that was the highlight at the time.’
