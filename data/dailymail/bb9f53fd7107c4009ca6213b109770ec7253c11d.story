Zombie cat: In January, a car hit 1½-year-old Bart the cat in Tampa

Farewell: Bart's owner, Ellis Hutson, has said he was so distraught, he couldn't stand the thought of burying Bart, so he asked neighbor to dig a shallow grave

It's alive! Five days later, on January 21, a matted and injured Bart emerged, meowing for food 

In January, a car hit 1 ½-year-old Bart the cat in Tampa, the Tampa Bay Times reported at the time.

Huston told the newspaper he was so distraught, he couldn't stand the thought of burying Bart, so he asked neighbor to dig a shallow grave.

Five days later, on January 21, a matted and injured Bart emerged, meowing for food, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

'At first it blew me away,' Dusty Albritton, the neighbor who buried Bart, told the newspaper. 'All I knew was this cat was dead and "Pet Sematary" is real.'

Bart suffered a broken jaw, a ruptured eye and a torn-up face, as well as dehydration and hunger, the newspaper reported. 

Hutson didn't know what to do, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

'It was unbelievable,' he told the newspaper. 'I've never seen anything like that before.'

Hutson contacted the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, which through the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund would help cover the costs of Bart's care, according to the newspaper. On January 27, the cat reportedly received surgery to remove an eye, wire his jaw shut and insert a feeding tube. 

At the time, the agency's executive director Sherry Silk told the Tampa Bay Times that Bart would recover in about six weeks and would be going home with Hutson.

'He's purring, even with all these injuries,' Silk told the newspaper. 'I can't even imagine how awful he must have felt. He's just a really wonderful, patient, loving cat.'

Treatment: Late last month, Bart underwent surgery to remove an eye, wire his jaw shut and insert a feeding tube, which cost more than $1,000

Discovery: Bart suffered a broken jaw, a ruptured eye and a torn-up face. He was reportedly dehydrated and hungry, but alive

However, on January 30 the Humane Society of Tampa Bay said in a statement on its website 'New Information About Bart: Recently we have learned new information about Bart’s home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial. Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat. We hope the Hutson family will do the right thing and surrender Bart to our care so that we can find an appropriate environment for him to live out his life.'

At the time, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay said both its Save-a-Pet Medical Fund and donations would cover all of Bart's treatment.

Last week, Silk told WFTS 'I don't believe [Hutson] has the ability to take care of this cat.'

According to the ABC affiliate, Silk described Hutson's daughter as continually attempting to play with Bart, saying 'She's a typical 2-year-old. We want a home with no young children that could put him in jeopardy.'

Silk also told the television station she viewed a YouTube video which shows Bart. 

'He might not have been dead,' an off-camera woman says in the clip, 7online noted, going on to say she later that she discovered the cat 'moving and stuff.'

Attention-grabbing? Hutson's suit also reportedly accused the Humane Society of Tampa Bay of 'keeping Bart for publicity to raise money for the organization' 

'If somebody tells you the cat is still breathing and it's alive, the cat shouldn't have been buried,' Silk told WFTS. 'I don't know if it was purposeful, but we are not going to return the cat to him.'

Silk also said at the time that the humane society would be willing to go to court.

The Humane Society of Tampa Bay told WFTS last week of a phone call it received from an individual who claimed to be planning to 'storm' the hospital and snatch Bart.

Hutson, meanwhile, told the television station last week 'If we have to go to court, we have to go to court. I haven't done anything wrong, and I don't think it's right to take my cat.'

In a statement sent to Daily Mail Online, the humane society said 'On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat.

'Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing, has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Society’s animal hospital.'
