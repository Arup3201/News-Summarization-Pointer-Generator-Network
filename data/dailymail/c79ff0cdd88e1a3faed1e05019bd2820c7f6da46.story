Fifty years since the Fab Four made their one and only visit to Australia, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were back in Sydney on Saturday.

The Beatles' iconic Abbey Road album cover was recreated in front of Sydney's Opera House by waxwork models, over 10,553 miles from where the band originally posed in London, to celebrate their arrival Down Under.

Dressed in swinging sixties garb, the models were placed on a zebra crossing in Sydney harbour - instead of outside Abbey Road Studios.

Abbey Road, released in 1969, was the eleventh studio album by the Beatles and remains their best-selling record.

The waxworks of the world's favourite band have just arrived in Sydney from Tokoyo and will be part of an interactive exhibit at Madame Tussauds in Darling Harbour, in the city centre.

Madame Tussauds first held sittings with The Beatles in 1964 - the same year that they toured Australia.

Of course what was lacking when the waxworks touched down in Sydney on Saturday was the hysterical Beatlemania that occurred when the real Liverpudlian lads arrived in Sydney on 11 June 1964.

The Beatles began their Australian tour in Adelaide on 12 June 1964, when 300,000 people lined the streets from the airport to the city to welcome them.

Ringo Starr was hospitalised in the UK when it kicked off so Jimmie Nicol was temporarily hired to stand in as a drummer until Ringo rejoined the group in Melbourne.

By the time they were back in Sydney on 18 June, it was Paul McCartney's 22nd birthday, and after the concert a party was held back at the Chevron Hotel.

Last week, one ardent fan, now 64, revealed they still have a piece of cake from the musician's 22nd birthday bash.

The Beatles were not only on their way to becoming the biggest rock band in 1964, they were also the first ever to be featured at Madame Tussauds.

For the new touring figures, Madame Tussauds have used a combination of the sitting measurements and additional image research including a number of image references from the 1969 Abbey Road photo shoot.Â

The style of the figures is based on their styling around the time, not long before the band's dissolution in 1970.

'Not only can guests interact with the famous four, but they can also recreate a moment of Beatles history in their very own Abbey Road album cover,' Quinn Clarke, general manager of Madame Tussauds Sydney, said.

The waxworks will be in Sydney until September, when they will be flown to San Francisco for the last leg of their tour.
