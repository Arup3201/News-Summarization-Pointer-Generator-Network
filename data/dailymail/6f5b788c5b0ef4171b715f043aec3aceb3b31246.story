A little girl's headless body was exhumed from a Missouri cemetery thirty years after she was found murdered in an abandoned apartment building in St. Louis.

'Jane Doe', believed to be between eight and 11-years-old, was exhumed last week with the hope that she might finally be identified and her killer brought to justice, KTVI reported.

Crews exhumed her body from Washington Park Cemetery in Berkeley, Mo., on June 17 after researchers and police spent months looking for her unmarked grave.

Evidence: 'Little Jane Doe', aged eight to 11, was found decapitated, bound and naked except for this bloody yellow sweater in February 1983

Found: The girl's remains were exhumed after an exhaustive search for her grave by investigators, volunteers and researchers, seen here

This at least the second time 
authorities have attempted to exhume the girl, but her remains weren't 
in their listed location due to the cemetery's neglect, KTVI reported.

A 23-year-old research associate at 
Washington University's Department of Computer Science & Engineering
reignited the effort to identify Jane Doe. 

Abby Stylianou told FoxNews.com that 
the girl's grave was unmarked. In order to find her body, Stylianou's 
team used newspaper photos from the girl's funeral and aerial images 
from the U.S. Geological Survey to pinpoint the burial spot.

'We were given access to eight photos
taken on the day she was buried,' she told FoxNews.com. 'There were 
trees and headstones that we know haven't moved.'

After digging for five hours, volunteers, experts from Washington University and the University of Notre Dame, the St. Louis City Medical Examiner's Office and police found a small, 55-inch wood casket containing what they believed are the girl's remains, according to KSDK.

Tests: Jane Doe's body was exhumed in an effort to finally identify her with modern technology and break the cold case

Lost: Jane Doe's headstone, paid for by University of Washington Students, left, was placed on the wrong burial site, making her exhumation difficult

Her body was taken to the medical examiner's office for DNA tests after it was found, but it could take weeks before tests might shed light on grisly cold case.

On Feb. 28, 1983, the girl's body was originally found by two men looking for scrap metal in a boarded-up apartment building in north St. Louis. The men found the headless child in a dark furnace room lying on her stomach, hands bound behind her back with red and white nylon rope and naked except for a bloody yellow sweater without its tag.

Police believe she was sexually assaulted before being strangled to death and decapitated with a long-bladed knife.

'We never had a child killed like that,' Joe Burgoon, a 43-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department who was among the first detectives at the scene after the two men called police, told FoxNews.com. 'I thought about her every time I drove by that cemetery.'

The girl, known as 'Little Jane Doe' and 'Hope', was never identified. Forensic anthologists could only determine that she was African American and tall for her age. Police never arrested any suspects and investigators couldn't match her description to missing children at the time, according to FoxNews.com.

Murdered: Two men found the unidentified girl's body in this abandoned house in north St. Louis. Police believe she was sexually assaulted, strangled and then decapitated

Because no one in the state reported her missing, investigators believe she wasn't from Missouri. Scientists will examine minerals in her bones to try to determine what part of the country she came from, but police think her killer was a local resident.

'He had to be familiar with the area,' Burgoon told FoxNews.com. 'It's possible she was killed by a relative or someone she knew because her head was taken off.'

'But who knows what these killers think,' Burgoon added. 'Anything is possible. It could have been a stranger.'

Burgoon, who was among those at the cemetery last week when the girl's body was exhumed, said the sweater she was found in seemed to be new. Police don't think she was killed at the apartment because there 'wasn't much blood at the scene'.

Investigation: A car takes the casket holding the body of a decapitated girl police believe was murdered in 1983 to the St. Louis City Medical Examiner's Office for tests to determine her identity

'Whoever carried her brushed against the wall and there were little streaks of blood,' Burgoon said.

Police couldn't tie her body to any reports of child abuse, either: X-rays showed no trauma, broken bones or scars.

Upon finding the casket, the University of Washington researcher, Stylianou, said she was both sad and hopeful.

'I felt an overwhelming sense of sadness about what got her to that point,' she told FoxNews.com. 'But now there's hope we can figure out who she was.'

A volunteer with the exhumation effort said he was relieved.

'We found her. I just praise God we found her,' Freddie Jefferson told KTVI. 'I hope they can find the DNA to figure out who she belonged to and catch who did it.'
