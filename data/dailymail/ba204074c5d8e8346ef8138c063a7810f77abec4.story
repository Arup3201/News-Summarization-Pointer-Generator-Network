Ministers are trying to use emergency powers to ban the publication of a damning report into the £50billion High Speed Rail project.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin called on David Cameron to veto releasing a report that labelled HS2 ‘red/amber’ and in danger of failing.

They claim it would cause ‘political and presentational difficulties’ and could seriously damage the project.

HS2 critics say the gagging attempt is ‘absolutely disgraceful’ and are using Freedom of Information laws to demand that the Project Assessment Review, from November 2011, be published. The Information Commissioner has rejected ministers’ objections and ordered them to release the report.

But in a leaked letter to Mr Cameron, circulated to ministers, Mr Maude and Mr McLoughlin urge that an emergency veto be put in place.

Such a veto is hardly ever used, but was deployed to stop publication of Cabinet discussions of the Iraq War.

Ministers are also considering whether to appeal against the Information Commissioner’s decision.HS2 has faced widespread opposition and claims of soaring costs.

The letter to Mr Cameron says: ‘Continuing with the appeal would create political and presentational difficulties at a crucial point in the HS2 project’s development . . . [therefore we should] exercise the veto now . . . Counsel has advised that we are very likely to lose the appeal.

‘We consider that the importance the Government attaches to the successful implementation of the HS2 project . . . justifies the use of the veto in this case as exceptional.

‘Disclosure of such recent information would also have a chilling effect on assessments of other Government projects and, indeed, on advice prepared for Government ministers on many other subjects.

‘Counsel has advised that it  will be better to veto now rather than after an adverse tribunal decision.’

A Whitehall source accused ministers of treating the report ‘like top secret intelligence’.

Senior Government sources believe Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood wants publication blocked because it would ‘create a precedent’ meaning all Project Assessment Reviews would have to be released.

Sir Jeremy is also blocking the release of correspondence between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and former US President George W Bush, which the Iraq Inquiry wants to publish.

Despite calls for the appeal to be dropped, the Mail understands it is likely to go ahead.

Whitehall sources predicted that if the Government loses the appeal – as its lawyers expect – then ministers will apply the veto. ‘I’m sure that’s what will happen,’ one insider said.

Joe Rukin, of the Stop HS2 campaign, said it was ‘absolutely disgraceful’ that MPs and the public will not be given the information before a Commons vote to approve HS2 next spring.

‘Trying to keep this secret is an absolute scandal,’ he said.

‘It seems that David Cameron’s so-called transparency agenda  is just a fraudulent aspiration.’ The Department for Transport refused to comment, but a source in the department said the latest review found that HS2 was only an ‘amber’ risk, rather than ‘red/amber’.

A Cabinet Office source argued that it was in the public interest to ensure that advice to ministers is not inhibited or watered down because of concerns it may be made public.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on leaked documents.

‘This Government is proud to lead the world on transparency.

‘We have published over 10,000 datasets on health, education, justice and transport to drive up the standards of public services and improve accountability.’
