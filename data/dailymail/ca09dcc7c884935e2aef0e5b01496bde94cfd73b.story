A policeman falsely accused an innocent banker of assaulting him in a 'shameful' bid to frame him after the alleged victim said he paid officers' wages, a court heard.

PC Jason Cooke, 42, claimed Anthony Jordine had pushed him into a shop window, causing it to break in Brick Lane, east London, jurors heard.

But it was Cooke who had dived at Mr Jordine, 29, the prosecution said.

Moments later, Mr Jordine, 29, a bank team leader, was forced to the ground and repeatedly kicked in the face after being apprehended in nearby Chiltern Street, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Describing the incident late on February 26 last year, Mr Connolly said: 'Mr Jordine was an innocent member of the public minding his own business, out with his brother and his friend.

'The defendant, rather shamefully, decided to fit him up.

'He pretended that Mr Jordine assaulted him in the street, pushing him against a shop window and causing the window to break.

'The Crown's case is that isn't true.

'Mr Jordine says he never assaulted the officer. Actually, when he was detained by the officer, it was he that was assaulted.'

Mr Jordine, who was in a 'jolly' mood,
was walking in the street when he was first spoken to by another 
officer, PC Alan Porter.

'He
hadn't done anything wrong, he was sort of jay walking I suppose, but 
it's not a road where many cars are moving,' said Mr Connolly.

Mr Jordine told PC Porter: 'There's no need to be cheeky officer, I pay your wages.'

PC Porter then radioed Cooke and another officer, PC Bob Golding, who were in a nearby bagel shop, asking for assistance.

'It appears he turns his back on the group he has been dealing with. He steps back into his own vehicle.'

Cooke and PC Golding chased Mr Jordine down Brick Lane into Bethnal Green Road and later Chiltern Street, said Mr Connolly.

'He is then taken hold of. He will say he was assaulted.'

Mr Jordine was taken to the police station and arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer and criminal damage, jurors heard.

The two allegations were further investigated

In his statement, Cooke claimed Mr Jordine told him 'f*** you' and ran off, adding: 'I lunged for him and caught hold of his wrist.

'The subject twisted out of my grip and pushed me off balance, causing me to fall and slam into a door window.'

Mr Connolly added: 'He described these events in a way that the prosecution say isn't how it happened, in order to falsely cause Mr Jordine to be arrested as a suspected criminal.

'Mr Jordine was interviewed and once the CCTV was seen, the view was taken, sensibly you may think, that there wasn't an allegation properly made against him.

'He was put on police bail which was cancelled.

'As a result of seeing that Mr Jordine didn't, on the face of it, assault the officer, the investigation was diverted to the police officer himself.'

Cooke claimed the incident happened in a 'split second' with what he feared was an 'unknown threat'.

He described the push as a 'misunderstanding of words', saying that wasn't what he really meant'.

Whatever contact there was had been brief, Cooke claimed, insisting his account was truthful, honest and reliable.

'Is there just air between these two men, and if there was, could Mr Cooke honestly have had the view that he had been assaulted by Mr Jordine, that he caused him to go into that window?' Mr Connolly added.

'Or is it that he decided to make up a false story flowing the events, because that is the prosecution case.

'This is not a mistake or misunderstanding, he made a conscious choice to fabricate an account of what happened.'

Wearing a pinstriped suit, a white shirt and a purple tie, Cooke spoke only to confirm his identity.

Cooke, from Colchester, Essex, denies doing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of justice.

The trial continues.
