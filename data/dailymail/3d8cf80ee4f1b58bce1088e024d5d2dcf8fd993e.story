Kelsey Grammer forgave the man who raped and murdered his sister but said that he should not be released, during an emotional testimony at the killer's parole hearing on Tuesday. 

The 59-year-old Frasier star testified against 57-year-old Freddie Glenn who kidnapped and murdered his 18-year-old sister, Karen Elisa Grammer, in 1975 when she was leaving her job at a Red Lobster in Colorado Springs.

'I accept that you live with remorse, but I live with tragedy every day,' the Cheers star said via satellite link at a Colorado parole hearing.

'I accept your apology. I forgive you. However, I cannot give your release my endorsement.'

Kelsey Grammer, pictured in May, said on Tuesday that he forgave murderer and rapist Freddie Glenn (right) for killing his 18-year-old sister Karen in 1975 but that he should not be granted parole

The actor said that to bless the idea of Glenn’s parole 'would be a betrayal of my sister’s life'.

A prison spokeswoman said on Wednesday that Glenn's parole request has been denied. He will next be eligible for parole in 2017.

Glenn and accomplice Michael Corbett snatched Miss Grammer on July 1, 1975, while she was  outside the Red Lobster restaurant, waiting for her boyfriend to finish work.

The thieves had tried and failed to rob the restaurant and reportedly thought that the 18-year-old, who was sitting in her car, could identify them.

A life cut short: Karen was a teenager when she was kidnapped, raped and murdered after leaving her job at a Red Lobster in Colorado in 1975

She was repeatedly raped over four hours at an apartment, according to KKTV.

She was then told she would be let go and released from a car at a mobile home park.

Glenn, who according to the trial had taken LSD, then slit the teenager's throat and left her on the ground.

She managed to make it to a nearby home for help but no one was home and she died on the back porch.

Her body was identified a week later by Kelsey Grammer.

Glenn was convicted of killing Miss Grammer and given the death penalty. The Supreme Court later overturned that decision and allowed him to seek parole after 30 years.

He also was convicted of killing another two men.

Glenn murdered motel cook Daniel Van Lone, 28, in a robbery from which he took 50 cents on June 19, 1975.

On June 27 that year, he killed 19-year-old Army soldier Winfred Proffitt over drugs.

The Denver Post reported Glenn was tearful at times as he apologized during Tuesday's parole hearing.

The murderer was 18 years old when he murdered Miss Grammer.  He told the court he believed that he deserved a second chance.

He added that he has a fiancée and a $200,000 trust fund that could help stabilize his life after being released from prison.

Glenn is locked up at Colorado’s Buena Vista Correctional Facility.

'I want to believe you have actually 
changed your life … things you say, I accept a lot of it,' Kelsey Grammar said on Tuesday. 

He then asked: 'If someone did to your sister what you did to mine, what would you think should be done to him?'

Glenn answered: 'I would be hurt, and I would be angry. I would like to think one day I would forgive.'

The last time Mr Grammer blocked Glenn's parole was in 2009. At that hearing, Chuck Heim, who investigated the murder described Miss Grammer's murder as 'vicious'.

According to KKTV, he said: 'She crawled up on a back porch, where there was a light, but the homeowners were out.

You could see bloody hand prints and finger prints where she tried to reach the doorbell for help and she died there.'

Mr Grammer, who was delayed from attending the 2009 parole hearing due to bad weather, sent an emotional letter to the jury about the effect that his sister's brutal death had on him.

He wrote: 'She was my best friend and the best person I knew. She had so much to live for. I loved my sister, Karen. I miss her. I miss her in my bones.

'I was her big brother. I was supposed to protect her - I could not. I have never gotten over it...It very nearly destroyed me.'
