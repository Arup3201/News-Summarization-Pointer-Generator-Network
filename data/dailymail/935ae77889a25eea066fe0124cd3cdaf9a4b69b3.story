A French backpacker was rushed to hospital after she was pinned inside a van crushed by a fallen tree overnight. 

More than a dozen police, paramedics and rescue workers rushed to the Lane Cove River Tourist Park in Macquarie Park, in north-western Sydney, around 2:30am.

The 27-year-old woman was pinned in the van by her legs and emergency services workers worked frantically to free her from the damaged vehicle.

This is the scene that confronted paramedics, police and fire and rescue workers in a Sydney caravan park this morning

Five French tourists were asleep in their Wicked Campers backpacker van when the eucalyptus tree dramatically collapsed on top

After an hour-long rescue operation, the woman was freed from the car via the roof.  She was laid down flat on her stomach and then put on to a waiting stretcher.

As her worried friends watched on, she was then loaded into the back of a waiting ambulance and whisked to Royal North Shore Hospital.  

Police said her injuries were not life threatening and she is in a stable condition. 

The four other tourists, who were also asleep in the multicoloured van at the time, managed to escape unharmed. 

The Wicked Campers vehicle they slept in sustained some damage. 

In 2014, the company was the target of a furious backlash earlier this year because of their vans' provocative slogans, which were criticised as sexist and misogynistic.

The complicated operation required more than a dozen emergency services workers 

The injured woman was rolled from her back onto a stretcher
