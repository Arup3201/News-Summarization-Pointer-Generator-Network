Michael Gove's advisor has slammed England's schools, teachers and universities, arguing that children's 'genetics' decide how well a child does.

Influential adviser Dominic Cummings claims in a withering thesis that educationists instead need to focus on how genetics affect children, and adapt education to suit a child's IQ.

In a scathing attack, the adviser 
criticises most of the education available to children in England today -
 from pre-learning facilities, to GCSEs, to university study to how 
education is researched.

Michael Gove's aide Dominic Cummings has produced a withering report on the state of England's education

The political aide says the Department for Education should be cut down, with hundreds instead of thousands acting as accountants and inspectors, the Guardian reported.

He also demands that private and state education should be indistinguishable, and the department should work to reduce the differences.

Mr Cummings maintains that individual 
child performance is mainly based on genetics and a child's IQ rather 
than the quality of teaching.

He argues that not only IQ but self-control and a conscientious character will shape a child's future.

He says a scientific way needs to be developed to produce a more ambitious education and training system.

The Cummings manifesto claims that 'the education of the majority even in rich countries is between awful and mediocre', and that the quality of maths education is especially poor.

He also says that 'real talent' is rare among the nation's teacher.

'In England, few are well trained in 
the basics of extended writing or mathematical and scientific modelling 
and problemsolving,' he wrote.

In
 the 250-page document, he claims that education standards have 
stagnated for the last 30 years and the actual research on education 
needs to be vastly improved.

It is not just teachers who are 
heavily criticised - Mr Cummings says university undergraduates should 
spend more time studying, and that the current demands are not taxing 
enough.

He also says that it
 is reasonable to believe that GCSE exams have become easier, which is 
why students have been earning top grades.

The Sure Start programme, aimed at providing early learning for pre-school children, is slammed by Cummings, who says there is little evidence for its practical impact.

The education adviser also claims that studies show children with little self-control are more likely to be poor, have serious health problems and be criminals.

Under Labour Sure Start Children's Centres were established to provide early learning and full daycare for children under five.

Sure Start Children's Centres are open to all parents and children and many of the services are free.

But the advisor argues that there is little evidence to prove that they make a strong difference to a child's educational development.

The adviser is leaving his role to reportedly become involved in free schools.

He told The Independent he was uncertain of what exactly his next position would be, but was interested in pursuing other educational developments 'outside politics', the newspaper reported.
