She competes all over the United States and is often paired with male opponents. According to an article about Leve on Phillyfit.com, when the teen was 14 she was already fighting women’s and teen boy’s advanced division in weight classes two divisions higher than her own (heavy and super heavy weight).  By the age of 18, Leve hopes to participate in Octagon Cage Fighting, a televised UFC event on the Fox channel on Friday nights.Why does Amanda want to participate in her high school’s wrestling team when she already takes part in other competitions? Because she believes wrestling will help her gain a college scholarship.Amanda is a self-professed tomboy and has no qualms about learning new techniques and learning how to wrestle.

Amanda’s father told Fox that the school hasn’t given a definite no but by the time the archbishops meet in April to discuss the matter, wrestling season will already be over.
