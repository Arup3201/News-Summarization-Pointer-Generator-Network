Australian tennis superstar Lleyton Hewitt is taking another shot at selling his fully furnish penthouse in the heart of Melbourne, which includes six bedrooms and six bathrooms for $10 million dollars.

The 33-year-old quietly listed the apartment two years ago with a different agent and an asking price of $15 million dollars, but he's now slashed that figure to $10 million during a slump period for the prestige market, according to The Age.

The former world number one and US Open champion in 2001 is believed to only stay at the pad on St Kilda Road when he is in town to play the Australian Open tournament, so he's decided to sell the property.
