A Saudi prince has been accused of killing 2,000 birds that are on the verge of extinction while on a safari holiday in Pakistan earlier this year.

Prince Fahd bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud - who is commonly known as Fahd bin Sultan - is said to have killed 1,977 near-extinct houbara bustards while on a 21-day trip to Chagai in Pakistan's Balochistan province in January.

An earlier version of this article wrongly included a photograph of HRH Prince Sultan bin Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who had no connection with the hunting trip.

At risk: Hunting in Pakistani sees the global houbara population shrink by between 20 and 30 per cent annually. Houbaras are highly valued by Arab royals, who consider their meat to be an aphrodisiac

An additional 123 bustards - which 
are covered by laws to protect endangered species - were slaughtered by 
members of the prince's travelling party, bringing the total killed to 
2,100.

Fahd bin Sultan, 63 
-the governor of Saudi Arabia's Tabuk Province and the second eldest son
 of late Crown Prince Sultan - is accused of hunting illegally in 
protected areas, according to a report by Karachi-based Dawn News.

The website claims to have seen a 
document titled â€˜Visit of Prince Fahd bin Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud 
regarding hunting of houbara bustard' which they say was prepared by 
Jaffar Baloch - a divisional officer in the local forest and wildlife 
department.

The report 
allegedly says the prince and his party hunted for 21 days - from Jan 
11, 2014 to Jan 31 - and had been granted special permits by the 
Pakistani federal government which allow important visitors to bypass 
laws preventing the hunting of houbaras.

These
 permits still require the recipient to kill no more than 100 birds over
 a 10-day period however, and only allow them to do so in certain areas.

It is not known if Fahd
 bin Sultan or any or his party will face punishments for violating the 
rules over how many birds they killed and for hunting with falcons 
outside the specified areas.

Houbaras are highly valued by Arab royals, who consider the meat to be an aphrodisiac.

For decades sheikhs have travelled to 
remote areas of Pakistan in time for the bird to make its winter 
migration from Central Asia. India banned the hunting of houbaras in early 1979.

The ongoing hunting in Pakistan has seen global houbara numbers fall to around 110,000 - with that figure decreasing by between 20 and 30 per cent every year.

After a particularly aggressive hunting season last year, Pakistan introduced an interim ban on killing the birds.

The move proved popular with local environmental campaigners who have grown tired of Arab sheikhs flouting hunting laws, but the Pakistani government appears to have subsequently eased the restrictions, issuing at least 33 houbara hunting permits already this year.

One reason they are likely to have done so is because Arab royals bring a huge economic boost to the poor regions in which they hunt.

They are said to travel in a convoy of private jets while on safari, with some transport planes given over purely to falcons and hunting equipment.

The sheikhs also make large donations while travelling in Pakistan's poor rural areas - paying for new schools and mosques to be built, as well as funding the repair of rundown roads and airports.
