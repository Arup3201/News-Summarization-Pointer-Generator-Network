Dinosaurs walked the earth about nine million years earlier than once realised, with recent discoveries of their cat and dog-sized ancestors providing the key to understanding their evolution.

Research has revealed small creatures which roamed the earth 245million years ago are likely to have been the immediate ancestors of dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus rex and velociraptor.

One of these is a labrador-sized carnivore, first discovered in Africa, which had a metre long tail and lived alongside other reptile-type species 243million years ago.

The footprints of another were discovered in a Polish quarry. This creature, from around the same time period, was the size of a house cat and is also thought to be part of the dinosaur lineage.

Paleontologist Richard Butler, from the University of Birmingham, wrote in a research paper that the recent discoveries of what were called 'dinosauromorphs' have 'placed the Polish Triassic record as a key to understanding the ascent of dinosaurs'.

He added the Polish quarry footprints, which he worked on, 'may provide a new frontier in understanding the evolution of early dinosaurs'.

The dated footprints shifted the origin of the dinosaur back to between 249 - 251million years ago, which was up to nine million years earlier than indicated by dinosaur body fossils and footprint records.

It was also only a few million years after the Permian/Triassic mass extinction of 252million years ago.

The fossilized upper arm and six vertebrae of Nyasasaurus, were found in what is modern day Tanzania, Africa, in the 1930s.

Nyasasaurus, which means 'Lake Nyasa lizard', was named after the lake in the region known as Nyasaland when it was a British colony until 1964.

They date from just a few million years after the 'Permo-Triassic mass extinction', the greatest of all time, and provide important insight into the origin and early evolution of dinosaurs.

All life on Earth today is descended from the four per cent of species that survived the mysterious event 252 million years ago that may have been caused by an asteroid impact or volcanic eruptions.

The extinction was caused by a volcanic eruption, which in turn triggered global warming and a climate which wiped out 96 per cent of all living species.

It was during the planet's recovery from this event that dinosaurs flourished before their extinction about 65million years ago.

Mr Butler wrote in a recent blog: 'Although most attention has been focused on the dinosaur extinction, arguably a more interesting question is how and why the dinosaurs became so successful in the first place.'
