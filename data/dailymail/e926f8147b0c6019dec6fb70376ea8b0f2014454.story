London has been revealed as one of the world’s most expensive destinations to celebrate New Year’s Eve.

Research conducted by foreign exchange firm Travelex showed that 24 per cent of Britons prefer to celebrate abroad in cities such as Prague and Budapest where the cost of alcohol and food is cheaper.

Traditionally one of the most lavish nights of the year, the survey showed that Londoners and visitors spend £336.14 per person in the capital on December 31 based on the average cost of a pint of beer, a bottle of champagne, an evening meal and admission to fireworks displays.

However, the same night out in New York was said to be £118.60, while in Budapest it was even cheaper, costing £66.81 – with the price of a meal for two as little as £22.

The cheapest destination out of those survey was found to be Prague, where dinner and drinks were shown to cost an average of just £42.90.

Of each of the six destinations surveyed, chosen because they are within a six-hour flight of London, the UK capital was the only city that is charging to see fireworks.

London Mayor Boris Johnson recently confirmed the famous Thames fireworks will have an entry fee of £10 for the first time ever.

Only half the number of attendees from previous years will be let in – meaning many families won’t be able to enjoy the traditional celebration, which was previously free.

Britons would need to budget for around £245 to ring in the New Year in Paris.

Although it’s not cheap, spending New Year’s Eve in the French capital is still shown to be almost £100 cheaper than in the UK capital.

The Canadian city of Toronto was also found to be good value for Britons looking to celebrate abroad.

David Swann from Travelex said: ‘The pound is providing good value for Brits who want to enjoy a New Year overseas.

‘Despite Brits being put-out by the price of celebrating in the UK, it’s great to see from our research that the price of key items such as beer and champagne are cheaper overseas.’

The survey also reveals that men are much more likely than women to splash the cash on New Year’s Eve, with the average UK man spending £200 on the event – 18 per cent more than the women’s average of £169.
