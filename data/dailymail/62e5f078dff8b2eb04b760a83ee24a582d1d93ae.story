Andy, the homeless man who was loved by his community, will forever be remembered as the 'gentle giant'.

While his identity remains a mystery, residents were evidently touched by his presence as nearly 200 locals paid their respects at his memorial service on Saturday.

The man of few words slept in front of Raine and Horne's real estate agency in Pyrmont but spent his days on a bench in Jacksons Landing - the northern tip of the inner-city surburb - overlooking Sydney Harbour.

Principal of Raine and Horne Pyrmont, John Ellis, helped fund the service which was held near Andy's bench.

'It was the obvious thing to do - he's human too,' Mr Ellis told Daily Mail Australia.

'He didn't bother the staff at all because he was polite and very respectful. He didn't ask for anything and didn't say much.

'He was a homeless person but he didn't act like one. He never drank, never smoked and just liked to keep to himself and draw in his notepad. He was a gentle giant.

'He didn't make much eye contact and he was quite shy.'

Andy, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, died a month ago from a suspected heart attack. 

Locals will place a plaque at his bench in his honour while a basket hangs from a nearby tree where residents have left behind their tributes. They include children's drawings of Andy enjoying the views of the harbour from his bench.

Mr Ellis says Andy had been sleeping outside the Raine and Horne office for about seven years while other locals speculated that he'd lived in the area for more than a decade.

Reverend Robin Davies, of Mustard Seed Uniting Church in Ultimo, says there was a huge sense of loss in the community when Andy died.

'There was a great outpouring of grief for Andy because he was part of our community,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'So the memorial service was an opportunity for the locals to express their thoughts.

'I guess some people even felt guilty because he was so young.' 

Reverend Davies says it is believed that Andy is from Queensland.

'But some people reckon he's lived in the area for 15 years,' she said.

'He seemed to feel at home and quite secure here. He was just quite happy with what he had and people respected and admired him for that. The community accepted him just as he was.'

Andy's body remains at a morgue, waiting to be claimed by a relative.

However if nobody comes forward, Reverend Davies says the community is willing to cremate him and scatter his ashes into the water in front of his favourite bench. 

A date for the funeral has not yet been set for Andy.
