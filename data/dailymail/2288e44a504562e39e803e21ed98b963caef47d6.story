It is an elegant drawing room whose windows allow the early morning light to flood in, bathing its occupants and furniture in a flattering glow.

Little wonder then, that The Morning Room at Clarence House is a favourite place of Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, to entertain distinguished visitors.

On Wednesday, it was Camilla’s turn to host Her Royal Highness Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands, who has been Chair of the European Union High Level Group of Experts on Literacy, which published a report into ways of promoting literacy across Europe.

Lap of luxury: 1. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands  are sitting on much admired Thomas Chippendale giltwood sofa, part of a suite of seat furniture by the famous designer comprising two sofas and two bergeres. Dating from about 1773, it may have been commissioned by George III’s brother, the Duke of Gloucester. 2. The porcelain in the cabinets behind them is largely comprised of a group of red-anchor Chelsea botanical porcelain , dating back to 1752-6, acquired by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother over a long period beginning in 1947. 3. Charles’s adored grandmother, the previous chatelaine of Clarence House, looms heavily in the room (although that is of little surprise, as the prince was closer to her than even his own mother). The painting to the right of the mantelpiece is a study for the Portrait of Queen Elizabeth as Royal Bencher of the Middle Temple by Sir James Gunn, 1945. 4. The small portrait on the mantelpiece is of the then Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, by Mabel Hankey, dating back to 1908. 5. There is another personal memento in the picture in the form of a photograph in a frame of The Prince of Wales and Prince Harry in South Africa 1997. Charles took his youngest son to the country in his half-term holiday of October that year following the tragic death of his mother just weeks earlier. 6. Other priceless antiques, either owned personally by the Royal Family or loaned by the Royal Collection, include the carved, painted and giltwood pedestals, with lights on either side of the sofa, which are mid-18th century in origin. 7. To the left of the mantelpiece is Sir Noel Coward’s painting entitled ‘Sortie de l’Eglise, Jamaique, 1961.’ 8. The bust is King George VI, the Queen’s father. 9. There is also a pair of cockerels which belonged to Queen Mary, inherited by Queen Elizabeth in 1953.

The two first met in Amsterdam for the
 Inauguration of King Willem-Alexander in April this year and discovered
 their shared a passion for promoting literacy.

The
 picture of the two women together provides a fascinating insight into 
the interior at Clarence House, which is currently the official 
residence of Prince Charles and his wife.

It
 was also the London home of the present Queen, then Princess Elizabeth,
 and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, following their marriage in 
1947. Charles lives there as a toddler between the ages of one and 
three.

The Queen Mother 
moved in following her daughter’s Coronation in 1953, until her death in
 2002. Her grandson moved back in on August 4 2003, the anniversary of 
her birth.

The house itself,
 often described as looking like a wedding cake, was built between 1825 
and 1827 to the designs of John Nash for Prince William Henry, Duke of 
Clarence. He lived there as King William 1V from 1830 until 1837.

The
 Morning Room was originally the Breakfast Room in Nash’s original 
design for the Duke of Clarence. Much later Queen Elizabeth changed the 
decorative scheme and introduced the chimneypiece.

The
 building itself was, and still is, very much regarded as a ‘home’ by 
all those who have been lucky to live within its elegant walls.
