A former clergyman who gave away a pet water buffalo yesterday lost a final legal attempt to have the animal returned.

John Kirby claimed he was delusional when he transferred Oink the buffalo and the one-acre field where he was kept to a friend who lived in the same village.

He took his case to the county court last year, claiming mental health problems meant he lacked the capacity to make sensible decisions at the time of the handover in 2006.

'Disgusting decision': Former clergyman John Kirby has lost a Court of Appeal battle to have Oink the water buffalo (pictured) returned after a judge dismissed claims he was delusional when he transferred the beast to a friend

But a judge ruled against Mr Kirby, 51, after hearing evidence from a psychiatrist who believed Mr Kirby knew what he was doing when he made the ‘gift’ to Katherine Moore.

Yesterday, the Court of Appeal backed the decision, bringing an end to the saga over the 18-year-old beast.

Lord Justice Jackson said there would be ‘no kindness’ in allowing Mr Kirby's appeal to go any further as it had no hope of success and would only result in a bigger costs bill.

Outside court, Mr Kirby, from Darley Dale, Derbyshire, branded the decision ‘absolutely despicable, disgraceful and disgusting’.

Oink became the subject of worldwide attention in 2008 when CCTV cameras were installed to protect him from cruel thugs who had thrown bricks at him, laced his food with mustard, put detergent in his water and set fire to his hay.

Lord Justice Jackson told the Appeal Court that Mr Kirby had been suffering from anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders when he signed over the animal in May 2006.

He gave the 1.25-tonne animal to Miss Moore, who also had ‘much affection’ for the beast and was able to look after him, keeping him on the land where Mr Kirby could visit.

In his appeal application in London, Mr Kirby, representing himself, argued that Nottingham County Court judge, Recorder Mark Anderson QC, was wrong in his decision last year.

He said the judge was wrong to reject his contention that he did not have capacity to make the gift and wrong to find that he had not been subject to ‘undue influence’.

But Lord Justice Jackson said the 
Nottingham County Court judge had ‘assessed the conflicting expert 
reports, looked at the contemporaneous records of the claimant's medical
conditions and reached a conclusion which seems to me to be plainly 
open to him.’

The Appeal 
Court judge said: ‘The relationship between the claimant and the 
defendant was not a relationship of a kind which gives rise to a claim 
for undue influence.

‘The 
claimant did not repose such degree of trust and confidence in the 
defendant as to give rise to a presumption of undue influence.'

Bleak message: The judge at the Court of Appeal (above) said Mr Kirby had no hope of his appeal going any further. he now faces paying most of Miss Moore's legal costs

He added: ‘I appreciate that my decision will be a great disappointment to the claimant and I am sorry to be the messenger who brings that disappointment to the claimant.

‘On the other hand, facts must be faced. This is not an appeal which would have any prospect of success if it went forward. The appeal would fail and the claimant would be landed with a further bill of costs.’

Mr Kirby faces paying 90 per cent of Mrs Moore's legal costs of the county court trial, but said he has not yet been told how much that will be.

Miss Moore, 62, a divorcee, yesterday said the ruling was ‘brilliant news’.

Speaking from her home in Darley Abbey, she said: ‘I had been effectively looking after Oink for seven years before I took him on in 2006.

‘I used to go past that field and feed him so often he’d end up waiting for me at the gate.

‘John agreed to give me Oink and sold me the field for £2,000 which was the market value. Then he turned around and claimed I’d ripped him off. He is a complete menace.’
