Liverpool have set off on their US tour with latest signing Lazar Markovic and Sunderland bound Fabio Borini among the squad.

Skipper Steven Gerrard – back from his extended holiday following the World Cup - was also on the flight which left Liverpool’s John Lennon Airport on Sunday, as were summer additions Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Emre Can.

The Reds 
will face AS Roma at Boston’s Fenway Park on Wednesday before taking on 
Olympiacos in Chicago (July 27), Manchester City in New York (July 30) 
and AC Milan in Charlotte (August 2).

Borini
 had been expected to complete his £14million move to Sunderland this 
week. The 23-year-old spent last season on loan at the Stadium of Light 
and manager Gus Poyet is keen to re-sign the Italian.

Markovic,
 meanwhile, sealed his £20m move to Anfield from Benfica last week and 
Liverpool fans will be hoping to get their first glimpse of the Serbian 
in America.
