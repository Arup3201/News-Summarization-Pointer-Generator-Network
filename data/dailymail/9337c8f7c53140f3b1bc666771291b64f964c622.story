James Taylor is used to wisecracks about his height. But when Kevin Pietersen’s scattergun autobiography took aim and pulled the trigger, the 5ft5in Taylor looked likely to become just another piece of collateral damage in English cricket’s civil war.

Now, as he prepares for England’s seven-match one-day series in Sri Lanka — a tour that will help the selectors finalise their plans for the World Cup — Taylor is in the mood to fire a few shots of his own.

Pietersen’s disregard for Taylor’s ability stems from his Test debut against South Africa at Headingley in 2012. In the first innings, while Pietersen was crashing a sensational 149, Taylor made 34.

Kevin Pietersen was critical of the way James Taylor batted against South Africa at Headingley in 2012

It was a quiet but crucial innings. The pair added 147. Pietersen, though, had made up his mind.

In KP: The Autobiography, he writes: ‘His dad was a jockey and James is built for the same gig. We were facing the fiercest bowling attack in the world. I didn’t think he was up to it.’

Pietersen took his concerns to coach Andy Flower, and — after Taylor was out — told next batsman, Matt Prior: ‘Listen, batting is easy. Taylor was just making it look hard. The South Africans were laughing at him. Just relax.’

There is some dispute about whether Pietersen belittled Taylor in the dressing room. But one thing is clear: a ringing endorsement it was not.

In his autobiography, Pietersen (right) said that Taylor was 'built for the same gig' as his dad - a jockey

Taylor has only played two Tests for England, both against South Africa during the summer of 2012

Taylor was dropped after making 10 and four in the next game at Lord’s and has not played Test cricket since. He said: ‘Plenty of people have slagged me off behind my back and he is just another one of them. It is plenty of years ago.

‘I haven’t spoken to him since and it doesn’t really bother me.’

Asked about their relationship now, Taylor said with a smile: ‘Me and Kevin are friends — we had a nice exchange on Twitter.’

What he may find genuinely amusing, however, was Pietersen’s attempts to justify his contempt. ‘The poor guy has never been seen again,’ writes Pietersen. ‘So I was wrong about Taylor, was I?’

Taylor’s performances for Nottinghamshire in last season’s 50-over Royal London One-Day Cup suggest Pietersen might have crowed too early.

Taylor's only two one-day international appearances to date have both been against Ireland

In seven innings Taylor crashed three hundreds, averaged 88 and had a strike-rate of 96. Only Kent’s talented wicketkeeper-batsman Sam Billings hit more than his 15 sixes. And every time one of Nottinghamshire’s games was televised, Taylor seemed to rise to the occasion. ‘As you have seen more over the last six months I can hit the ball as far as anybody and as cleanly as most,’ said Taylor, who was speaking to promote Royal London’s sponsorship of the PCA’s Benevolent Fund.

‘In my eyes my height has never proved a problem. Sachin (Tendulkar) is not that tall (he is also 5ft5in). I can pack a good punch and I can perform in pressure situations.’

He might also have added that, at the age of just 24, he has already made 12 List A centuries, from 97 innings. Pietersen has 15 from 233, and averages 40 to Taylor’s 53. Now he will have the chance to take his game to the next level.

Aside from those two Tests against the world’s best pace attack, Taylor has played only two one-day internationals, both against Ireland. The experience has added to his drive.

‘I have been frustrated to say the least that I haven’t had a more consistent shot,’ he said. 

India's little master Sachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as the best batsman ever despite his height

‘I didn’t get told an official reason. The only thing I got told was to go away and score more runs, which I consistently did in all three formats.Everybody can say they are mentally strong but I think that is one of my strengths.

‘I have been knocked down plenty of times and I will be knocked down plenty more. It is how you bounce back.

‘A big thing that spurs me on is proving people wrong. With my size I am going to have plenty of doubters. I have proved them wrong over the years and I will prove plenty more people wrong over the next few months and years.’

If the process begins in Sri Lanka, the selectors may just be able to pencil in a middle-order name for the World Cup.
