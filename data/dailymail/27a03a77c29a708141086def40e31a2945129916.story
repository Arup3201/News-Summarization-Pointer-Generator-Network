Steven Holliday was accused of ruining the career of a junior female employee because she could not satisfy his 'sexual demands'

A married energy boss was yesterday publicly accused of ruining the career of a junior female employee because she could not satisfy his ‘sexual demands’.

Steven Holliday, chief executive of the National Grid, is said to have abused his powerful position to pursue the young woman and control her fledgling career.

The extraordinary claim was made by an audience member at the annual shareholders’ meeting of Marks and Spencer, of which Mr Holliday is a non-executive director.

During a question-and-answer session with 2,000 shareholders, a woman stood up and accused the 55-year-old of breaching ‘his own ethics policy’ regarding her daughter.

She added: ‘He talks about supporting the young, yet he pursued her, used his power to control her job and destroyed her career when she could no longer meet his sexual demands.’

National Grid have confirmed they were made aware of the allegations in 2010 but dropped the matter after carrying out an investigation.

He is chairman of the remuneration committee at Marks and Spencer and was sitting on the panel to be questioned by the shareholders when the outburst began.

The woman began her question by addressing another panel member, saying: ‘How can you support Steven Holliday’s position chairing the committee which determines executive pay when he has breached his own ethics policy with my daughter?’

Gasps echoed around the auditorium as security staff fumbled to switch off her microphone, but she continued to talk until she was ushered out of the building with her husband.

Marks and Spencer staff tried to stop onlookers from talking to the visibly shaken woman as she was escorted from the conference at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

She told The Mail: ‘I can’t talk any more about it. I have to go now.’ Her daughter was a high-flier working for National Grid before her alleged ordeal, she added.

And she insisted her daughter, believed to be in her early thirties, had not been in a relationship with Mr Holliday.

The claims are highly embarrassing for Mr Holliday, who is married and is believed to have at least two daughters.

He has been group CEO of National Grid since 2006 and last year earned £2.2million. He was appointed to the Marks and Spencer board in July 2004.

After the meeting, Mr Holliday left through a back door but National Grid later issued a statement dismissing the woman’s claim.

It said: ‘We have known about the allegation since 2010. It has been investigated and found to be without foundation.

‘[The complainant’s] departure from the company was by mutual agreement. Due to legal constraint, we cannot comment further.’
