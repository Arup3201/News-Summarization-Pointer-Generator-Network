Teachers demanded a 20-hour a week limit on classes yesterday to maintain a healthy ‘work/life balance’.

Union members called for a rigid 35-hour week, with little more than half given over to teaching children.

Five hours would be used for planning, preparation and assessment ‘at a time and place of the teacher’s choosing’ – meaning at home in most cases.

The remaining ten hours would be set aside for other ‘non-contact’ duties including marking and going to meetings.

The proposal came at the end of a 
heated eight-day period during which annual conferences held by three 
teaching unions were used to repeatedly attack the policies of Education
 Secretary Michael Gove.

The working hours motion of the 
National Union of Teachers – which was passed by an overwhelming 
majority and will be linked to planned strikes over pay, pensions and 
conditions – would mean teachers taking classes for just four hours a 
day on average. Many schools would have to hire extra staff, putting 
greater pressure on budgets.

Cutting teaching workloads is one of 
the demands in the current dispute with Mr Gove that has led to a series
 of regional strikes from this summer, followed by a national strike 
before Christmas.

The teachers complain that they spend too much time outside lessons marking and preparing for parents evenings, leaving them without time to have meetings or plan lessons

Critics were swift to accuse the union
 of being ‘out of touch’ with reality. Craig Whittaker, a Tory MP on the
 Commons education select committee, said: ‘You can’t change these 
things in the current economic climate.

‘It just shows how incredibly out of touch the unions are with what’s going on in the real world.’

Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for 
Real Education, said teachers should have their hours ‘expanded, not 
diminished’. He added: ‘In the independent sector it is normal to have 
60 hours of contact time a week. They are living in fantasy land if they
 want 20 hours per week.’

He said the hours of work should be 
made less stressful by giving them greater powers to suspend or exclude 
disruptive pupils. The NUT saved its bombshell for the last motion of 
its five-day conference in Liverpool. Cambridgeshire primary school 
teacher Richard Rose said: ‘We’re fed up with arriving at 7.45am ... and
 most people are there until 6.30pm.

‘During that time there is no time to 
go to eat, no time to talk, no time to think, no time even to go to the 
toilet in many cases.

Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, lead criticism of Education Secretary Michael Gove  who has faced calls to resign from most teaching unions

‘Then, after the day’s work, what do 
you do when you get home? Do you relax? I’m sure you all know – another 
two, three, four hours of work. The number of emails you get after 
midnight, people sending each other plans, targets, data, things like 
that is incredible.’

Teachers were sacrificing time with 
their own children, he said, adding: ‘If you complain to management 
about that they say “Maybe teaching’s not for you then”.’

Adarsh Sood from Lewisham in 
South-East London said: ‘We will fight in all the ways we can to win a 
model contract which clearly defines the weekly limits on working hours 
for teachers.’

Earlier in the day, delegates chanted: ‘Gove must go’ as they passed a motion of no confidence in the Education Secretary.

Teachers are contracted to work 195 days every year, with five set aside for training.

They typically spend 22.5 hours taking classes each week, meaning the proposal would significantly reduce contact time.

But they complain contracts include a clause to carry out ‘reasonable additional hours’, meaning they end up working longer.

Coventry delegate Christopher Denson 
said official figures showed secondary school teachers work 50.2 hours 
per week on average and primary school colleagues give 49.9 hours of 
their time.

He added: ‘It is essential that what is already NUT policy for a 35-hour week becomes a reality.’

The NUT and NASUWT are holding a 
series of regional strikes followed by a national strike later this year
 over pay, pensions and conditions. Some teachers are already operating 
on a work-to-rule basis.

The working hours motion – during 
which teachers also called for smaller class sizes – is the latest point
 of friction between teachers and Mr Gove.

They have also clashed with him over 
issues such as changes to the curriculum and the end of modular 
qualifications. The Department for Education said it was for schools to 
organise the hours and workloads of staff.

A spokesman added: ‘By scrapping 
unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy we are making it easier than ever 
before for teachers to focus their efforts on teaching and learning.’
