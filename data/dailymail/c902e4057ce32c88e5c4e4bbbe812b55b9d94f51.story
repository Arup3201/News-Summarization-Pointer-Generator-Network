The Jeremy Kyle Show has been criticised for allowing a woman to abuse her teenage sister by calling her a 'crackhead' and a 'silly anorexic slapper'.

Leah, 17, was accused of taking crack cocaine and spending time in 'crack dens' in the episode of the ITV programme, which was broadcast on September 23 last year.

She also failed a lie detector test over whether she had stolen from her mother - causing her heavily pregnant older sister, Kelly, to tell her she was 'finished' with her family.

Under fire: The Jeremy Kyle Show has been criticised for allowing a woman, called Kelly (right), to abuse her 17-year-old sister, Leah (left), by calling her a 'crackhead',  a 'horrible little girl' and a 'silly anorexic slapper'

'Distressed': Leah (pictured, second left, with her boyfriend, Matt) was accused of taking crack cocaine and spending time in 'crack dens' in the episode of the ITV programme, which was aired on September 23 last year

Now, media regulator Ofcom has claimed the show breached broadcasting guidelines by not doing enough to prevent the teenager from becoming 'distressed'.

In the episode, Leah could be seen sobbing and breathing heavily as she was repeatedly accused of drug abuse and stealing items, including a camera, jewellery and objects of personal value, from her family.

Ofcom said she appeared 'visibly distressed, shouting, crying and breathing heavily' and was 'unable to defend herself' during the programme.

In one scene, Leah could be seen shaking her head and wiping tears away from her eyes backstage as Kelly accused her of being a drug addict, a thief and a 'horrible little girl'.

In another, the two siblings had a 'heated exchange' on stage, which saw the older of the pair shouting accusations at the younger while security guards restrained them from getting too close.

Kelly could then be heard shouting: 'If you are going to do something, do it. Don’t just stand there flinching like a silly anorexic slapper'.

Meanwhile, presenter Kyle told 
viewers that Leah had a 'reputation' with the opposite sex and had 
'slept with 33 men' - to which, the teenager replied: 'Really?' 

Argument: Ofcom said Leah appeared 'visibly distressed, shouting, crying and breathing heavily' and was 'unable to defend herself' during the programme. Above, Leah protests against her older sister's allegations

Kept apart: The siblings' 'heated exchange' quickly escalated - with security guards forced to restrain them

Later in the show, Leah, who appeared on stage with her boyfriend, Matt, could be seen holding her hands against her head and breathing quickly in an apparent 'state of anxiety' as she received her lie detector results.

Ofcom launched an investigation after receiving a complaint from a viewer who was concerned about the reliability of the test results given the distress they had appeared to cause the teenager.

Following the inquiry, the regulator ruled ITV had failed to apply 'generally accepted standards' in the episode, which was aired at 9.25am.

Upset: In this scene, Leah (pictured with her boyfriend, Matt) can be seen shaking her head and wiping tears away from her eyes backstage as Kelly accused her of being a drug addict, a thief and a 'horrible little girl'

It added that Kyle had not appeared to tackle the teenager's distress in 'any meaningful way' - and at times, had 'reinforced' it.

In a report, it said: 'The 17-year-old participant appeared very distressed at times.

'She
 cried and shouted in response to the allegations of theft and drug 
abuse, was visibly upset at references to her family's response to her 
alleged behaviour, and at times appeared unable to defend herself and 
respond to her older sister's threats and allegations.

Presenter: Kyle told viewers that Leah had a 'reputation' with the opposite sex and had 'slept with 33 men'

Talk show: Following an investigation, Ofcom ruled that Kyle had not appeared to tackle the teenager's distress in 'any meaningful way' - and at times, had seemed to 'reinforce' it. Above, the presenter speaks to Kelly

'However, at no time did the presenter appear to respond to her distress.'

Ofcom said the show had failed to explicitly reference the 
support which had been available to the teenager from its production 
team.

It concluded: 'As a 
result, viewers were not provided with sufficient information - and so 
context - regarding the steps that the licensee had taken and had in 
place to ensure due care was taken over her emotional welfare and 
dignity, and to limit her distress.

Separated: Ofcom launched the investigation after receiving a complaint from a viewer who was concerned about the reliability of the lie detector results given the distress they had appeared to cause the teenager

'The offence caused
 to viewers by the humiliation and distress of the 17-year-old was not 
justified by the context.'

The regulator accepted ITV's submission that it did not intend to mislead viewers about the 
teenager's safety, welfare and dignity - nor did it mean to 
deliberately try to distress her.

It
 also accepted that there had been an adequate amount of support and care provided.

But it reminded broadcasters they needed to take care when including young 
people in shows that involve conflict or confrontation to let the
 audience know what steps have been taken to ensure the youngsters' welfare has 
been protected.

Following the investigation, ITV accepted that 'it might have been helpful' to indicate more clearly in the programme that support for Leah was 'ongoing'.

But it added that it would have been 'evident' to the audience that care was provided to her throughout the show and that guests were 'monitored' by staff.
