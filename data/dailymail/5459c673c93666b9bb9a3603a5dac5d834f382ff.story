The House of Lords voted last night on an extension of the Human Rights Act, which could cover middle-class elderly people

Elderly people paying for their own care could be protected under the same human rights laws as those who receive State care, after a landmark vote in the House of Lords last night.

Under the current system, people whose care is funded by the State may sue care homes on human rights grounds if they are treated badly.

Last night’s ‘unprecedented’ decision to support an extension of the Human Rights Act could cover middle-class elderly people who live in private care homes or pay to be looked after.

The Lords voted by 247 to 218 to support a move that would ensure even people who paid for their own care would be covered by the Act.

The amendment to the Care Bill was backed by a majority of 29 despite health minister Earl Howe arguing it was ‘neither necessary or appropriate’.

He said the Human Rights Act dealt with public functions – the ‘interface between the  individual and the State’.

And he said if the amendment was agreed ‘it would represent an unprecedented change to the scope of the Human Rights Act’.

‘For the first time, it would  capture purely private arrangements such as a privately arranged social care contract between a private care home and a private individual – an arrangement in which there is no State involvement at all,’ he said.

Independent crossbencher Lord Low of Dalston, who proposed the report stage amendment, said that following a 2007 court case – YL against Birmingham City Council – there had been uncertainty over whether care home services provided by the private sector under contract with a local authority were covered by the Act.

The Lords voted 247 to 218 to support a move that would ensure even people who paid for their own care would be covered by the act

He said his amendment would settle the matter and ‘include those who are eligible for care but who, due to means testing, have to arrange and/or pay for the own care – so called self-funders’  currently not covered under human rights laws.

The amendment would ‘provide equal protection to all users of regulated social care, regardless of where that care is provided and who is paying for it’.

The amendment to the Care Bill was backed by a majority of 29

He added: ‘Surely it is right to take this opportunity of putting the matter beyond doubt.’Lord Mackay, supporting the amendment, told peers that the Department of Health said people who provided this type of care ‘should consider themselves bound by the Human Rights Act’.

But he said the position should be made clear. Labour former health minister Lord Warner pointed to the case of a woman who had been paying for herself in a care home.

‘She had the temerity to air her views on assisted dying which didn’t please some of the staff,’ he said. ‘She didn’t seek anybody’s help to commit suicide, she just expressed her views.

‘The home’s management gave her four weeks’ notice to leave the home as a result.‘When her son raised the issue of her rights under the Human Rights Act with legal counsel, the opinion he was given was that she lacked protection under the act because she was not in receipt of a service from a body providing a function of a public nature because her placement was neither in a publicly provided or publicly funded home.’

He called for Parliament to provide self-funders with the ‘legal certainty that other elderly people have when they are having domiciliary care or residential care’.
