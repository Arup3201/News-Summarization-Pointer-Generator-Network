Horsemeat: Leeds-based supermarket giant Asda removed the £1.54 products from stores across Britain two weeks ago on March 8

Asda has withdrawn tens of thousands of its own brand corned beef - after it was found to contain up to 50 per cent horsemeat, it emerged today.

The supermarket giant removed the £1.54 products from stores across Britain two weeks ago on March 8 - and tests this week showed quantities of horse DNA above trace levels.

Leicestershire County Council found the ingredients of one batch of the 340g tins were half horse, but Leeds-based Asda has insisted it only found levels of up to five per cent.

Asda, which has carried out more than 700 tests on products during the horsemeat scandal, has now had eight products that have been positive for at least traces of horse, reported The Sun.

A spokesman for Asda said the chain has ‘taken a belt and braces approach’ to testing for horse DNA and quickly removed any products from its shelves ‘whenever we’ve had any concerns’.

The Walmart-owned chain with 500-plus stores, whose Smart Price Corned Beef is manufactured by French supplier Toupnot, has also scraped its Chosen By You Corned Beef line, reported the Sun.

The spokesman added: ‘These corned beef products are safe to eat within sell by dates, but if you have them in your cupboards you can return them to us for a full refund.’

Europe's horsemeat scandal erupted in 
January, when testing in Ireland revealed that some beef products also 
contained equine DNA, and the problems then spread across the continent.

The scandal ensnared numerous well-known brands, prompting product withdrawals, consumer concerns and government investigations into the region's complex food-processing chains.

City of London Police fraud experts will lead the probe into the horsemeat scandal, co-ordinating the response to what ministers have claimed is an international criminal conspiracy.

In the Commons earlier this month, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson described the adulteration of food products with horsemeat as a ‘criminal conspiracy which covers 23 countries’.

Spokesmen from Asda and Leicestershire County Council were not immediately able to clarify the discrepancy between levels of horsemeat each of them found in the chain's corned beef product.
