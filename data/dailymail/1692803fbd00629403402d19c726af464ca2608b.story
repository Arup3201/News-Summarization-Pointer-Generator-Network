Burnley hope to conclude the permanent transfer of Michael Keane from Manchester United on Thursday.

The clubs held talks on Wednesday night over a £3million deal.

The 21-year-old has already been on loan at Turf Moor for the first half of this season and Sean Dyche is keen to make the move permanent.

Keane has made 11 appearances for the Clarets this season, including 10 in the Premier League.

He has settled well into the back four at Burnley and will look to continue his career development under Dyche's management.

Blackburn Rovers, Derby County and Leicester City are the three clubs who Keane has previously spent time on loan.
