The major American intimate apparel manufacturer, Jockey, recently announced it is getting rid of A/B/C/D cups altogether.

Instead, Jockey's new Volumetric Fit System measures the volume of a woman's breast - with sizes running from 1 through 10 - as well as their under-bust measurement to create a 'near-custom' fit.

But for $60 per bra, and $19.95 for the try-at-home kit available online, skeptical customers have had reservations about the new system. So FEMAIL took Jockey's volumetric sizing kit for a test drive, to see just how well it shaped up.

Good fit: Jockey's new Volumetric Fit System comes with 10 plastic cups, a measuring tape and instructions on how to find your perfect bra size

Using Jockey's flexible plastic 
measuring 'cups' in varying shapes, we tried each one on for size to 
see what worked best - with the least amount of gapping spillage.

Next came measuring under the bust, using the color-coded, and double-sided (for mirror reflection ease) measuring band.

There are seven different band sizes to choose from - 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 or 42. However I measured 31, and am still not quite sure where that leaves me.

Patented: The Double Lined Contour Bra (left) and the Classic Contour Bra (right), $60 each, are two options in Jockey's new JOCKEY Bra range and have a patented 3-D contour design that does away with underwires

Soft support: The Classic Soft Cup Bra (left) and the Double Lined Soft Cup Bra (right) have 'unique 3-D Inner Sling Support for a revolutionary soft cup' that has no underwire, but gives firm support

To give customers piece of mind, however, Jockey offers a Love at First Fit guarantee promise - or your money back.

And while the Volumetric Fit System costs $19.95 from Jockey.com, this amount is actually redeemable as a $19.95 discount off the price of your first bra.

'It’s always a risk when you change something that’s been in the market 
for a very long time, but not only are we changing the fit, we’re 
changing the whole product,' explained. Jockey's senior vice president, Sally 
Tomkins.

DIY measuring: Jockey's new bra fitting system enables women to measure themselves at home to find their perfect fit using 10 different-sized plastic cups

'It took us eight years to develop 
the new Jockey bra and its revolutionary Volumetric Fit System,' said 
Sally Tomkins, Jockey's senior vice president of design, research and 
development.

'Through
our research, and countless hours of testing and talking with women, we
are confident we are answering women's desire for the perfect-fitting 
bra.'

Current standard cup sizes are based 
on two measurements - the breast at its fullest 
point, minus the rib cage measurement. A one-inch difference equates to 
an A cup; a two-inch difference, a B cup, and so on.

Price point: The Volumetric Fit System costs $19.95 from Jockey.com, which redeemable as a $19.95 discount off the price of your first bra

Jockey 
International says this 80-year-old equation doesn’t account for volume and 
different breast shapes.

The bra itself (FEMAIL was sent the Classic Contour to try in a size 2-32) is padded and extremely soft, giving full coverage; but we do have some reservations.

Although Joceky has replaced traditional bra underwires with '3-D contour support,' the hard material feels much like the underwire of my usual bra, anyway.

And after using the cup fitting system - determining my bra size as 3 - the size 2 sample bra felt gappy, rather than too small. Which lead to some measurement confusion.

Bra shopping is notoriously 
traumatic, with research showing 75per cent of women have trouble 
finding a bra that fits properly, and a staggering 85per cent of women are wearing the wrong sized bra.

While FEMAIL appreciated the ease of a 'buy online and try-at-home' service, we felt we still needed guidance as to whether our measuring techniques were correct.

According to research on Jockey's website, 53per cent of women have never been professionally fitted for a bra - and DIY fitting, despite Jockey's sophisticated fitting system, is still no 'professional' fit.

Finding a 'true' bra size is never as 'simple' as a simple two-step process. While innovative, the Volumetric Fit System is still best tried within the supportive confines of a Jockey store.
