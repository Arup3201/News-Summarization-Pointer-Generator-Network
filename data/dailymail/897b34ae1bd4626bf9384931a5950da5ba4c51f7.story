The family of a climber who drowned in a sea cave today branded the inquest into her death a 'total sham' and asked if rescuers could have done more to save her.

The parents of Charlotte Furness-Smith claimed the full truth about the bid to save her from the flooded cave she had been swept into had not been revealed at an inquest into her death.

They claimed the two hours it took coastguards to carry out the unsuccessful rescue attempt was not properly examined at the hearing. The coroner ruled she died of misadventure.

Mr and Mrs Furness-Smith also raised 
concerns that key witnesses were not called to give evidence, including 
one who thought the rescue effort took too long.

But
 coroner Mr Sheriff Payne commended the actions of the coastguards and 
recommended an officer who risked his to enter the cave for the Queens 
Commendation for Bravery.

Miss
 Furness-Smith, a former Royal Navy 'poster girl', had been coasteering 
with her brother Alex on November 2 last year when they were swept into a
 cave by 15ft waves.

Mr Furness-Smith,
 31, tried to summon help on his mobile phone but couldn't get a signal 
and so left his 30-year-old sister to swim out for help.

Coastguards and lifeboat crews were unable to reach Miss Furness-Smith due to the severe conditions and spoke to her through a blowhole in the top of the cave.

Coastguard
 Ian Bugler finally risked his own life by being lowered down the 
extremely narrow hole after hearing Miss Furness-Smith scream 'get me
 out of here'.

By the time he entered the cave at cliffs near Swanage, Charlotte had drowned, the inquest heard

He described the moment he found her body after being lowered down the 15ft hole just wide enough for him

By the time he entered the cave, two hours into the rescue, Miss Furness-Smith, who was known as Buffy, had drowned. Her body has never been recovered.

Speaking
 after the inquest, Patricia Furness-Smith called into question the 
legitimacy of the hearing and said the family were already pursuing a 
second inquest.

Mrs 
Furness-Smith, an author, psychologist and magistrate, said: 'The family
 has no confidence that this inquest properly examined the circumstances
 of Buffy's death and the rescue operation that took place.

'We
 feel this has been a total sham. We need to discuss it with our legal 
representatives and make a decision (as to whether to appeal for another
 inquest).

'We have lost our wonderful daughter and we would like to have some peace and quiet to actually grieve for her.

'But
 equally we owe it to her to actually get to the truth of how her last 
hours panned out. It is imperative that no other family ever suffers 
what we have gone through.

'If it takes a fight in order to make sure people do learn lessons then we must follow that through.'

Miss Furness-Smith,
 a maths teacher, had travelled to the Dorset coast with her brother to 
go kite-surfing but it was too windy so they decided to go coasteering 
at Tilly Whim Caves near Swanage.

They put on wetsuits, buoyancy aids and helmets before clambering down the cliff onto a ledge and jumped into the sea at 1.30pm.

As they swam past the cave entrance they were hit by a 15ft sea swell whipped up by 60mph winds and swept into it.

The
 inquest heard from a coasteering expert who said he would never have 
considered entering the sea on that day due to the severe weather 
conditions.

Recording a 
verdict of misadventure at the inquest in Bournemouth, Mr Payne said: 
'What I can't ignore is that Charlotte and Alex put themselves in a 
risky situation in poor weather that was predicted to worsen.

Rescue attempt: Her brother, Alex, left her trapped in the cave while he called for the Coastguard. They rushed to the scene, but could not save her in time

'Alex confirmed they had not checked tides or anything like that. It was predictable that the weather was going to worsen.

'The
 information was available but Alex and Buffy decided to enter the sea 
on that November day anyway to do the activity of coasteering.

'They
 were strong swimmers but they were rapidly overcome. They were swept 
into the cave and that is how the whole sad affair started.

'If Alex had not been able to escape, no-one would have known they were there. They may have both perished.

'This particular misadventure went very sadly, and indeed fatally, wrong.'

Mr Payne praised the coastguard rescue team and said he would be recommending Ian Bugler for a bravery award.

Aftermath: In the hours after the horrifying incident, rescuers had to retrieve her body from the tiny inlet. Today, Alex, 31, told an inquest she screamed for help while she was trapped in the small cave

Tide: A lifeboat crew tried to reach the 5ft entrance to the cave but was beaten back by the waves. One rescuer was lowered down into the cave, but Charlotte was already dead

Adrian Rogers, helicopter paramedic winchman, was also in attendance to hear the accounts of what happened

He
 added: 'He acted with considerable bravery. He was advised he did not 
have to go down into the blowhole but the decision was taken that it was
 the only option available.'

In
 a statement Scott Titt, president of the British Mountaineering Council
 and who was at the cliffs on the day, raised concerns about the 
apparent lack of urgency of the rescue.

But Mark Rodaway, manager of Portland coastguard, said his team did all they could to reach Miss Furness-Smith.

He
 said: 'This was a complex rescue with winds gusting up to 60mph, 
horrendous sea conditions combined with high tide and limited access to 
the cave.

'This was proven 
when one of our coastguard rescue officers risked his own life when 
attempting to abseil down a narrow blowhole.

'I
 am confident the coastguard helicopter crew, rescue teams and the RNLI 
lifeboat crews on scene that day made every effort while there was still
 a chance of a successful rescue outcome.'

Miss Furness-Smith, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, was born in Trinidad and Tobago and her family returned to the UK when she was eight.

She
 joined the Royal Navy Reserves at Exeter University and was part of the
 Navy's recruitment team. She graduated in engineering before going on 
to qualify as a maths teacher and worked at a school in Bristol.
