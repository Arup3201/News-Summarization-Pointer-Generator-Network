A PENSIONER was conned out of his life’s savings by “despicable thieves” who targeted him at a cash machine.

The 84-year-old victim was withdrawing money outside Barclays Bank, in  Coventry, when he was approached by two women and a man.

They duped him into thinking his card had been swallowed up by the machine and one of the women escorted him into the bank to report it.

Wanted: CCTV images of the suspects police are hunting

The two others stayed outside, stole the card from the machine and used it to withdraw cash.

They then went on a shopping spree using the card at a local betting shop.

The thefts were not discovered until staff at the victim’s bank alerted him to the withdrawals.

Police today released CCTV images of three suspects they want to question in connection with the incident on June 20.

One of the suspects escorted the pensioner into this branch in Ball Hill, Coventry, to report card had been swallowed by machine

PC Fiona Cremin said: 'Although the incident happened in June, we are determined to catch the despicable thieves who preyed on an elderly man.

'We believe that the man, who lost his wife to cancer a few years ago, was targeted by this group.

The Barclays cash machine where the OAP was targeted.

'A man on a bike was seen to make a phone call, shortly before the group of three left their car and walked straight over to the victim.

'The women then tried to distract the man at the ATM before duping him into thinking his card had been retained.

'Understandably the victim is upset at losing his life savings but has said that if had been twenty years younger he would have chased the thieves himself.

'He is well known in the area and has been described as a lovely man.

'We are led to believe that the thieves may travel around the area and may have links with Essex.'

Police believe the thieves were using a purple Ford Fiesta at the time.

The group may have had an accomplice on a bicycle who was seen to make a call when the 84-year-old man started using the cash machine.

Anyone who can help identify the people in the images should contact Pc Fiona Cremin by calling 101.
