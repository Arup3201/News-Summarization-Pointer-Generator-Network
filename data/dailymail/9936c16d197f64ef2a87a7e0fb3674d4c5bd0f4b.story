Directory: George McCoy's controversial book lists the contact details, specialisms, working hours and charging policies of almost 600 sex workers in the capital

A book entitled 'A Guide to the Working Ladies of London' was at the centre of a police prostitution probe today after selling 500 copies on Amazon.

Police officers have been asked to investigate the new directory which ranks prostitutes on a five-star scale.

The book lists the contact details, specialisms, working hours and charging policies of almost 600 sex workers in the capital.

The £10 directory has sold more than 
500 copies, according to author George McCoy, 63, a retired vinyl record
 seller and veteran reviewer of sexual services.

However, Kit Malthouse, deputy Mayor 
of London with responsibility for policing, said he would ask the Met to
 investigate the legality of the book.

He said: 'It strikes me that reviewing human beings in the same way as a restaurants is repellent.

'The thing people forget is that 
the world of organised prostitution is also a world of organised crime, 
drug dealing and abuse. Anything like this that tries to sanitise it is 
revolting.'

Mr McCoy, 
who has also written a book called Guide to the Agencies, Corrective 
Services and Parlours of London, said he took all the measures he could 
to ensure those listed work of their own free will, and had no moral 
qualms about his work.

He said: 'I think we have far too many people in this world telling us how to behave.

'Obviously we want to give a good example to the youth of the country, but you should be free to do what we want as long as it’s not going to harm anyone else.'

He said he’d sold copies to 'gentlemen, including viscounts and knights of the realm,' and police would be wasting their time if they investigated.

He said: 'There have been far more blatant cases that have been taken to court and people were found not guilty.

'I’m not saying it’s legal, but all 
sorts of things are illegal. It’s a question of whether it’s in the 
public interest to take me to court.'

A Met Police spokesman said they would consider investigating when they received information from Mr Malthouse.

A spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan 
Police Service’s human exploitation and organised crime command responds
 to, and builds up, intelligence pictures in areas of the sex industry 
where the most harm may be done.

'Our primary aim is to make London a hostile environment for traffickers and those who exploit people to operate in.'

Mr McCoy used personal experience, 
newspaper adverts and the internet in his attempt to research and rank 
every individual working lady in London.

He edits four specific guidebooks, 
McCoy’s British Massage Parlour Guide, McCoy’s British Escort Guide, 
McCoy’s Guide to Adult Services in London and McCoy’s Guide to Adult 
Services in East Anglia, the Midlands and Wales.

Based on his McCoy’s scoring system, Chessington’s workers scored highest with an average of 4.5 stars.

The working ladies of Surbiton 
received an average 3.4 stars, those in Kingston were rated at three 
stars, and New Malden’s working women were given 2.7 stars.

He described nearby Croydon as boasting 'a number of working ladies, although none are of any note'.

One former prostitute, listed in the 
guide despite starting a new career, said she fell into the role through
 friends, and had no regrets about a job she enjoyed.

She said: 'I suppose [the book] is 
handy if you are a guy who wants this kind of service. It’s good it has 
people’s real opinions rather than what the people who do it themselves 
say. It’s good to have an honest opinion.'

The
 Guide to the Agencies, Corrective Services and Parlours of London gives
 a similar star rating to dominatrixes and 'masseurs'.

Despite the police being asked to look at A Guide to the Working Ladies of London, it is unlikely that any prosecution would be brought against its author.

The police may, however, be interested in offences connected with advertising on behalf of prostitutes. Such offences may include Conspiracy to Corrupt Public Morals or to Outrage Public Decency.

But as author George McCoy is merely providing a guidebook and not working with or making money from the women he promotes, the police may have difficulties in bringing a charge.

Even if the police passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service, it would have to consider whether a prosecution would be in the public interest.

British courts also take Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights - Freedom of Speech - very seriously.

Free expression cannot be curtailed simply because a publication might offend. The question of whether a publication outrages public decency is one for a jury and the threshold for guilt is very high.

Mr McCoy has four other guidebooks out concerning adult services and has never been prosecuted.

That more than anything shows that a police charge against Mr McCoy is unlikely to happen.
