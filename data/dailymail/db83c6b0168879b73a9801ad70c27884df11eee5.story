A mother has been left furious after being forced to home school her four-year-old daughter who was was rejected from nine schools in her local area.

Estelle Perrons should have started term last September but now faces an uncertain future because no school in her catchment area has enough space to take her.

Her mother Emily Perrons, 26, had set her sights on St Mary’s Primary School, the same primary school her other two daughters Elizabeth, ten, and Eve, eight, go to.

Emily Perrons, 26, has been forced to home school her four-year-old daughter Estelle after nine schools said they did not have enough room for the toddler to attend

However, after being told there was no room, the single mum was forced to look elsewhere. The search has continued without success for the past eight months.

Miss Perrons, who doesn’t drive, said Nottingham City Council told her the nearest school that will take her daughter is six miles away in Clifton.

But as the mum-of-three has to walk her other children the two miles to their school she is being forced to home school Estelle as it is 'physically impossible to be in two places at once.'

Yesterday Miss Perrons, from Sherwood, in Nottingham, fumed: 'It is ridiculous, I am now facing the option that my daughter might not go to any school.

'She is going to nursery for three mornings a week but she is the oldest there as she is nearly five and the nursery is saying they can’t cater for her much longer.

'Now I just want her in any school I can physically get to. I have appealed all nine schools’ decisions but it is looking unlikely.

'It would have been nice for her to be with her sisters as I don’t want them split up but that doesn’t seem like an option.

Estelle was supposed to start school last September and was hoping to attend a nearby primary with her two sisters, but was turned down for a place (file pic)

'I was working at Argos before I had children and I just want any job now.

'If I can’t get Estelle into school I won’t be able to get a job and the government will make me go on Job Seeker’s Allowance.

'I don’t want to claim benefits, I want to work. It is not my fault there are not enough school places.

'We are already walking four miles a day and if we do get the bus a family ticket is £9. To get to Clifton as well would mean spending nearly £20 a day just on bus fares.

'All I want is for Estelle to be in school and get an education.

'I have started looking to see if we can move because I think that will have to be the last resort.'

Geraldine Kelly, head teacher at St Mary’s, in the Sherwood area of Nottingham said they faced a difficult task at having to turn down places for children.

She said: 'We are popular because we get results and are rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. It is difficult but we have to turn down some parents.'

Councillor David Mellen, portfolio holder for children’s services for Nottingham City Council, has pledged that a place will be found at every school.

He said: 'We are working very hard to offer every child a place as quickly as possible.'
