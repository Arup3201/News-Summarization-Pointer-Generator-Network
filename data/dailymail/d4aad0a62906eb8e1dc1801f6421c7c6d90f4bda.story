These two DJs certainly managed to‘drop the beat’ in spectacular fashion.

Only on this occasion it was in a much more literal sense than they would have hoped for.

Australian musicians James Todman and Brett Allen were performing at the Gold Coast’s Aloha Beach Party earlier this month when they began dancing a little too enthusiastically behind the sound system.

The pair, who work as DJ’d for Australia’s Rave Radio, were playing to a packed auditorium when they accidentally knocked their equipment off the stage.

They sent the table tumbling off the stage, taking with it their laptop and CD decks.

The sound system instantly cut out, leaving a bemused crowd jeering.

However, the mishap didn’t stop the duo from immediately uploading the footage to Facebook where it was widely shared and circulated among music fans.

While the incident looked bad, Rave Radio reported that ‘equipment didn’t get the slightest bit of damage,’ and that the music was back on in around five minutes.

Mr Todman and Mr Allen, who has been DJing since he was 13, have been widely touted as among Australia’s best DJs, while their live performances have been described as ‘second to none’.
