TV watchdog Ofcom has rejected complaints that comedian Ricky Gervais's use of the word 'mong' during a stand-up show was offensive.

The Office star and controversial comedian claimed that Britain's Got Talent singer Susan Boyle looked like a 'mong' during his 'Science' live show on Channel 4 last year.

During a tirade about the Scots singer in October, Gervais said: 'She would not be where she is today if it wasn’t for the fact that she looked like such a f*****g mong.'

Controversy: Gervais, seen here in a picture posted on his Twitter feed, branded Susan Boyle a 'mong' and repeatedly used the term on the micro-blogging site last year

Outspoken: The comedian, pictured hosting the Golden Globes last week, was described as 'exploratory and subversive' in an Ofcom ruling today

'When she first came on the telly, I went, "Is that a mong?" You all did.'

The jibes saw charity bosses write to Gervais to demand he stop using the word, which they saw is a cruel nickname for Down's Syndrome sufferers.

Ofcom launched an investigation, but today cleared Channel 4 of breaching guidelines on offensive content.

The TV regulator ruled that although Gervais's comments could cause 'considerable offence', they were justified in the context of a late night comedy show.

Ofcom ruled that Gervais's jibes towards Susan Boyle were 'justified in the context of provocative comedy'

During the show, Gervais went on to say that he didn't mean Boyle had Down's Syndrome, and argued the word 'mong' was no longer associated with sufferers of the condition.

Ofcom said that in the name of freedom of expression, no word was banned after the TV watershed.

However, there must be a good reason for using language many people find offensive.

The regulator's own research found that many people did not know of ‘mong’ came from the term ‘mongoloid’ – an offensive term for people with Down‟s syndrome – but it ‘could cause considerable offence to those who are aware of the association’.

In its ruling, Ofcom said: 'We noted that the programme began at 22:35, more than an hour and a half after the watershed, and that therefore most viewers of the programme would have been expecting stronger and more challenging content.

'The late scheduling of the programme,
 and its late night comedy context on Channel 4, meant that the majority
 of the audience was likely to expect the exploratory and subversive 
bent of the programme in general and of Ricky Gervais's humour in 
particular.

'Offensive': Gervais's previous use of the word 'mong' saw him contacted by campaigners who demand he stop using the term

The comedian has insisted the meaning of the word 'mong' has changed over time

'We also took 
into account that Channel 4 brought the challenging nature of the 
content to the attention of viewers with a warning at the start of the 
programme, which stated that it would contain 'strong language and adult
 humour'.

'We therefore concluded that several aspects of this content had the potential to cause considerable offence.

'However, on balance, this potential offence was justified by the context of this provocative comedy routine challenging the evolution of words, as broadcast with a warning as part of a late night comedy show on Channel 4.'

The broadcasting regulator did, however, issue a warning to TV bosses about the use of the word 'mong'.

Although Gervais claims 'mong' is no longer a derogatory term, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) still classifies it as offensive:

Its entry states:'Mongol: A person with Down's syndrome. Now generally regarded as offensive.'

The use of the word harks back to the implied similarity in appearance of those with Down's syndrome and the Mongol race of East Asia - who established an empire in much of Eurasia during the 13th century.

Its un-PC usage is cited in the OED as far back as 1866:

'I have for some time had my attention directed to the possibility of making a classification of the feeble-minded by arranging them around various ethnic standards.

'A very large number of congenital idiots are typical Mongols.'

The citation is from none other than John Langdon Down - the man after whom Down's syndrome was named.

It was Down's work at an asylum in Surrey in the late 1860s that led to the term 'Mongolian idiocy' being used to classify certain clinical cases.

It was not until 1961 that the term Down's syndrome was first used, following consultation with genetics experts unhappy with the previous label.

They said their research showed it had the potential to be highly offensive and 'great care' should be taken over its use.

Gervais has been criticised by the Down Syndrome's Association for his repeated use of the word.

The award-winning comedian and writer landed himself in hot water for a second time with his use of the word by repeatedly using the word 'mong' on his Twitter account and blog.

After using the word on the mico-blogging site, Gervais was eventually questioned by Nicola Clark, a disability campaigner and mother of two disabled girls.

Mrs Clark broke down in tears while discussing the row on Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show last October.

Mrs Clark had wept while discussing the abuse directed at her daughters by people on the street using words like ‘mong’.

Multi-millionaire Gervais went on to describe his use of 'mong' as 'naive' in an online conversation with Mrs Clark.

Gervais then contacted Mrs Clark on Twitter to offer ‘a very public thank you’ for her ‘kind, rational and understanding words in private’ since the issue broke.

Speaking about the controversy last year, Gervais said: 'I have used 'mong', but never to mean Down Syndrome and never would.

'The meaning of words change over time, 'gay' for example. 'The modern use of the word 'mong' means dopey or ignorant, it's in slang and urban dictionaries.'

Channel 4 argued that Gervais was 'exploring the contemporary use of the word in a comedic context' and said he did not mean to suggest Boyle had a disability.

After Gervais's use of the word 'mong' in October, Penny Green, director of Down's Syndrome charity Down's Heart Group, refuting his claim that the meaning of the word has changed.

After learning of Ofcom's ruling, she told MailOnline today: It's very sad that in effect Ofcom is excusing Ricky Gervais because of the time the show was broadcast and a very loose warning about content and yet they issued a warning to TV bosses about the use of the word saying 'their research showed it had the potential to be highly offensive and 'great care' should be taken over its use.' 

'It's almost like giving carte blanche to anyone to use offensive language directed at a particular group just as long as they do it at 'an appropriate time'.

'Why can't we just accept people for who they are?  And if we really can't cope with their differences (usually from fear of the unknown or outdated and unrealistic stories I might add), can't we just avoid them without feeling the need to publicly poke fun at and humiliate them.'

A spokeswoman for Boyle refused to comment.

Representatives for Ricky Gervais did not respond to requests for comment.
