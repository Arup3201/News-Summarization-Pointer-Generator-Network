The last time Alan Shearer and Ruud Gullit were in the same room it was the Newcastle United manager’s office, Duncan Ferguson was there, too.

The Scot – like Shearer, dropped for the Tyne-Wear derby the previous night – had beaten his team-mate to it, heading straight for Gullit’s quarters the following morning to vent his fury.

Last move: Gullit dropped Shearer (background) for the Tyne-Wear derby in the 1990-2000 season, which Newcastle lost 2-1

The Dutchman had gambled - and lost. Newcastle were beaten 2-1 by Sunderland and by the end of the week he had quit Tyneside.

Shearer later said that, if Gullit had not resigned, he would have been forced to leave his hometown club.

Gullit – five years on in 2004 – hit back, claiming Shearer ‘did not do his best for me’ while in charge of the Magpies.

But
 on Friday they were reunited, sharing a television studio on the 
Copacabana Beach as part of the BBC coverage of Germany’s quarter-final 
with France.

The winner? Shearer went on to have a fabulous career at Newcastle, but it could have been different

Nail in the coffin: The defeat to Sunderland was Gullit's third in four games, and he was later had quit

Fellow pundit 
Rio Ferdinand certainly saw the funny side, as he tweeted: ‘We have a 
studio Love in here...Mr Shearer & Mr Gullit are hugging & 
joking around! Surprisingly very pally!’

And
 presenter Gary Lineker could not resist asking Gullit: ‘Have you ever 
left a big player out of a starting line-up?’ To which Gullit, pointing 
at Shearer, replied: ‘Yes, him’.

Shearer came back: ‘Yeah, and look what happened’.

The old adversaries were soon laughing and shaking hands, however, even revealing they’d played golf together.

It just goes to show, time is a great healer.
