If Louis van Gaal is struggling for inspiration he might be pleased to see that Sir Alex Ferguson has written a book on leadership.

The former Manchester United manager, who released his last autobiography in 2013, will be back on the shelves in the autumn.

Ferguson, like Van Gaal, endured a torrid time to his start in the Old Trafford hotseat before going on to usher in an unheralded era of success at the club.

Co-authored with Michael Moritz, the book will detail Ferguson's tactics and management techniques

He has now teamed up with investor and author Sir Michael Moritz to pen an analysis of his 38 years in management.

Promoters say the book, entitled 'Leading', reveals 'the key tools he used to deliver sustained success on and off the field'.

They add: 'From tactics to teamwork, from hiring to firing, from dealing with the boardroom to responding to failure, the book will analyse the pivotal leadership decisions of an astonishing career.'

Van Gaal's men, who have a tricky run-in, are currently looking vulnerable in fourth position in the Premier League and are out of the Capital One Cup and FA Cup following Monday night's disappointing 2-1 home defeat to Arsenal.

The Dutchman is expected to have a busy off-season with another £150million spending spree planned as he attempts to overhaul an under-performing squad.

But he may do well to seek out Ferguson's latest effort when it is released next October - which even reveals the details behind his own philosophy.

The man himself, now 73, said: 'Since stepping into retirement I have had the opportunity to reflect on my time as a football manager, and to consider the reasons behind my success through personal recollections, conversations with Mike Moritz and my role at Harvard Business School. 

'It has been a new experience for me to be looking into the past rather than planning for the future, but one that I have found enjoyable and rewarding.

'The process behind creating this book began many years ago following my first meeting with Mike, which immediately created a mutual respect for each other's achievements. Over the past year, we have spent many hours together as we have worked our way through my life in order to draw out and discuss the key philosophies I applied during my career.'

Sir Michael added: 'Though I have two left feet and cannot dribble, I have long been fascinated by the characteristics of those extremely rare individuals who are capable of exerting an extraordinary influence on the rise, success and durability of the world's highest performing organisations. 

'That topic led me to Sir Alex. It has been an enormous pleasure to debate the subject with Sir Alex over the last seven years or so and to collaborate with him on this book.'
