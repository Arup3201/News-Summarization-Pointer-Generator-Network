A senior Pentagon official has flatly denied any plan to ransom Bowe Bergdhal, the American soldier held by the Taliban, after claims a conman disappeared with the cash.

The allegation was raised by a member of Congress, who said that Department of Defense tried to pay ransom to win the release of Sgt Bergdahl from the terrorist Haqqani network in Pakistan, but was duped.

California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter made the extraordinary allegation in a letter to Chuck Hagel, the Defense Secretary.

But Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary has now firmly denied any ransom plan, military.com reported.

'There was no ransom offered, there was no ransom paid – nor was there an attempt to do so that failed,' he said.

A triumphant President Barack Obama announced Bergdahl's release in May, offering no suggestion that his administration had tried to ransom him before opting for a 5-to-1 prisoner swap instead

 However there was no clear attempt to address whether money had been paid - and disappeared.

'I'm not aware that any money changed hands,' Kirby said.

But on the issue of payments to intelligence sources he added: 'There are such exchanges.'

The carefully worded statements don't appear to rule out the possibility that money was sent but never reached its target.

Joe Kasper, the press secretary to , told MailOnline on Thursday that the Pakistanis holding Bergdahl 'wanted to deal. They were desperate to deal.'

Official denials from the Obama administration, Kasper said, are par for the course but likely deceptive. 

'We know better than to believe that,' he explained. 'That's what they're going to say, and that's fine. We should expect that. But where there's smoke there's fire.'

'They can deny it all they want,' added Kasper, speaking of the administration's official spokespersons.

'But there are people within the Defense Department itself who are saying otherwise. Their own people. ... We know who discussed this issue within the Pentagon. We know who briefed the secretary.'

He said the government is in the habit of entertaining ransom plans, but always through third-parties that will give the United States deniability.

'We don't pay a ransom in the sense that the U.S. government officially makes payments to a foreign entity,' Kasper said, emphasizing the word 'officially.'

'The way we've been doing this for a long time is through a workaround.'

Rep. Hunter, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served two combat tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan after the 9/11 terror attacks, is among Capitol Hill's most persistent military bloodhounds. 

Pentagon officials flatly told the congressman this year that there was no consideration of a cash swap for Bergdahl, Kasper said.

'They told him categorically that, no, it never happened. That's when we decided to press down on the accelerator. And the information we got back was resounding.' 

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday that the Obama administration flatly opposes the idea of paying for the release of Americans held captive overseas.

'It's not in the best interests of American citizens to pay ransoms to any organization, let alone a terrorist organization, that is holding an American hostage,' he said.

'And the reason for that is simple: We don't want to put other American citizens at even greater risk when they're around the globe, and that knowing that terrorist organizations can extract a ransom from the United States if they take a hostage only puts American citizens at greater risk.'

Hunter dropped a bombshell in a Nov. 5 letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, claiming that America's Joint Special Operations Command 'did pursue at least two lines of effort for Bergdahl: a kinetic rescue operation, if necessary, and; a payment to the Haqqani Network to gain Bergdahl's release.'

'It has been brought to my attention,' Hunter wrote, 'that a payment was made to an Afghan intermediary who 'disappeared' with the money and failed to facilitate Bergdahl's release in return. The payment was made in January-February 2014.'

Hunter also seemed to understand the careful parsing of denials that often follows inquiries – from both congressmen and journalists – into sensitive national security matters.

'I recognize the reluctance to describe a payment as a ransom,' he wrote, but claimed the botched payment was made – 'regardless of how the transaction is described.' 

In a separate letter to the directors of the FBI, the CIA and U.S. Special Forces Command, he expressed his understanding that 'a transfer occurred that possibly included payment to Haqqani from the Taliban for the receipt of Bergdahl.'

According to The Washington Times, unnamed officials said the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force anti-terrorism squad handled the Bergdahl ransom mission.

'The FBI also was involved in the ransom payment attempt and was waiting inside Afghanistan's border with North Waziristan when the release failed,' the Times reported, 'confirming that it had been a scam.'

The USA Patriot Act makes it a crime to give payment or assistance to terror groups that could boost their support, and hostages' family members have said publicly that the federal government warned them against raising money for their loved ones' safe return. 

But retired Lt. Col. Oliver North told WMAL radio in Washington in June that he had direct knowledge of the negotiating process and was sure the Haqqani network had asked for a cash payment.

Bergdahl, he said, 'was never regarded as a – quote – 'prisoner of war.' They all thought of him as a hostage and that's the way they presented it. All they wanted was money.' 

Earnest's statement on Wednesday came in response to questions about a government-wide review of U.S. hostage policies, requested this summer by President Barack Obama. 

Bergdahl is back on active duty now, after five years of captivity

The Pentagon completed a review of his case in October but has yet to release it, citing the need for an internal review. Angry Republicans including some on the House Armed Services Committee claimed in the days before the midterm election just weeks ago that Democrats were holding it back for political advantage. 

The self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, a militant terror group that now controls large sections of Syria and Iraq, has executed three American hostages this year in gruesome beheading videos distributed via online social media.

That group has reaped at least $20 million this year in hostage ransoms, according to Treasury Undersecretary David S. Cohen, but often decides that the propaganda value of videotaped killings outweighs the value of money.

Bergdahl was released in May after the Obama administration made a different kind of trade – not for money, but for five high-value Taliban terrorists who had been held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba military detention facility.

The enlisted soldier came under fire for allegedly deserting his U.S. Army unit in Afghanistan before he was captured by Taliban fighters. That group reportedly sold him to the Haqqani network, a notorious crime syndicate with centuries of history trading hostages for gold, opium and other commodities.

The Haqqanis held Bergdahl for five years. He is now back on active duty and serves at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.
