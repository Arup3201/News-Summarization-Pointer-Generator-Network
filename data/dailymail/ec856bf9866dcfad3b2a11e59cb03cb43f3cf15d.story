Princess Michael of Kent reveals in a radio interview how she once crooned with jazz singer Peggy Lee, best known for her rendition of Fever, and even joined the King of Malaysia to sing karaoke

She likes to sing jazz in the bath of her 17th century apartment in Kensington Palace, while he, apparently, prefers to stick Abba on the stereo.

In a sometimes unintentionally hilarious interview about her musical tastes, Princess Michael of Kent has lifted the lid on how her husband, Prince Michael, who is the Queen’s first cousin, has a penchant for a certain 70s Swedish supergroup.

She also boasts how she once crooned with legendary American jazz singer Peggy Lee, best known for her rendition of Fever, and even joined the King of Malaysia to sing karaoke.

Dubbed Princess Pushy for her imperious ways (the Queen once joked that she was ‘far too grand for us’), Princess Michael has told Radio 4’s Saturday Live programme that she comes from a ‘very musical family’.

'We’ve always sung. As I have become a grandmother and become older, of course you have less voice and you notice this in the bath,’ she says.

Asked what sort of tunes she would sing in the bath, she replies: ‘Well, you know, I go back to my sort of youth and I don’t know if you’re old enough to remember somebody like Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell’s early songs, that sort of romantic, slow... you know?

And asked what she would sing in the bath, Pushy replies: 'Well, you know, I go back to my sort of youth and I don't know if you're old enough to remember somebody like Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell's (above, right) early songs, that sort of romantic, slow... you know?'

'In these old houses, I mean, we’re here in the 17th century part of the palace and I can really belt out a tune if I want, nobody’s going to hear me at all.’

The Princess claims she once even got the chance to sing with Peggy Lee on a trip to New York - ‘can you imagine?’.

‘I said, "You know, I’ve always loved singing your song Fever", and she said "let’s do it", and there was a piano and there was a pianist and so we sang together - it was such fun, I can tell you,’ she recalls.

Prince Michael, she reveals, much prefers the music of the 70s, however.

'My husband happens to love Abba, for example. And I used to scorn him when he’d say "I’m going to play Abba", and I’d say, "Uh, oh my goodness",’ she said.

She revealed she had once visited a jazz club in New Orleans - but always retained her decorum.

‘I don’t think I’ve ever let myself go in public - I don’t even know what it would mean. I mean, I let myself go on horseback by really galloping until, you know, I think I’m going to die,’ she said.

Princess Michael even admits she has sung karaoke on several occasions, belting out the odd version of Moon River among others.

She said: ‘Well I found it [karaoke] for the first time in my life in, of all places, Malaysia - where we went for the wedding of the then king’s daughter.

'They said, "Oh, we’re having a karaoke evening tonight", so I didn’t know what that was, so fine, yes, I thought it was some sort of marvellous food really and everybody was singing away and they sounded good, so that was quite fun.’

Asked whether she took part, she replies: ‘Oh, I did. I did in Malaysia, yes. Then, last summer, we were in Sicily with friends, where we often go, and they had karaoke, so yes, I found myself singing along with them.’

... and it turns out that the Prince, a first cousin of the Queen, loves Abba

Most members of the royal family, she said, were into classical music. ‘We meet each other at the opera or at concerts and things.’

Although claiming to be a good singer herself - ‘I’m pitch perfect, I’ll have you know!’ - she says she has never been tempted to pursue it as a profession.

‘You know, I love to sing and I don’t find it difficult to read music, but no, I would never have been talented enough to be a singer and also it’s a very, very demanding thing to be,’ she says.

‘I’m not allowed to sing on this programme. I would love to burst into song for you, but I’m not allowed.’

Asked why, she said: ‘Because I’ve been told categorically that the press reaction will be that my next stop is The X Factor, and I’ve been forbidden, forbidden. So there we are.’

Princess Michael appears on Saturday Live, BBC Radio 4, on January 18 at 9am.
