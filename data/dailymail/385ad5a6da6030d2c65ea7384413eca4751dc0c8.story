The diamond as big as the Ritz: The world's biggest and round-cut diamond is going on sale

The world's largest and rarest round-cut diamond is creating a stir among millionaires, who are set to fetch bid more than £12million at auction for it.

The 7.59-carat round vivid blue diamond, named Premier Blue, is the only one of its kind on record.

It will go sale in Hong Kong at Sotheby's on October 7.

The exceptionally rare gem is approximately the size of a shirt button.

The brilliant-cut, internally flawless gem  is that largest of its type as round cut is rarely used in coloured diamonds due to high waste in the cutting process.

And the rarity of the sale is expected to spark a bidding war among East Asian collectors - who have followed it around its world tour across London, Geneva, New York and Doha.

Luxury auctioneers Sotheby's have predicted a record £12million ($19million) sale, and selected bustling jewellery market Hong Kong as the final destination.

Quek Chin Yeow, deputy chairman of Sotheby's in Asia, said: 'No significant round fancy vivid blue diamond has ever appeared at auction worldwide thus making the Premier Blue a rare and exceptional gem.

'For around seven years Hong Kong has ranked alongside Geneva and New York as a centre for jewellery sales.

'It is now the third pillar of the global jewellery market.'

Eagerly-anticipated: Sotheby's in Hong Kong says the diamond could set a price-per-carat record

The choice of Hong Kong as a place to sell the stone underlines just how important Asia has become as a consumer of luxury items, as rapid growth has swelled the ranks of the ultrarich.

Despite the nation's rapid growth seemingly reaching its peak, it has not dented the ability and willingness of these superrich to spend - as the rich generally remain rich even when times are worse, luxury industry analysts said.

Sotheby's is previewing the stone and other auction items around Asia, including in Beijing, Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore, Jakarta and Taiwan - a reflection of the regional spread of buyers.
