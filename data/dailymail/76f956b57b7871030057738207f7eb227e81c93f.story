Harlequins survived having two men sent to the sin bin to record an unconvincing win over London Irish in an ill-tempered affair which failed to live up to the earlier offering at Twickenham.

Following the nail-biter between Saracens and Wasps, this match was always going to struggle to hit the same heights and it was no surprise it turned into a niggly contest between two sides likely to finish the season at opposing ends of the table.

Harlequins, beaten semi-finalists last season, lost Joe Marler and Kyle Sinckler to the sin bin in the second half to allow Exiles fly-half Shane Geraghty to keep the pressure on with five penalties.

Game of two halves: Harlequins were excellent in the first half and terrible in the second

But despite the second-half absence of their props for 10 minutes apiece - both dismissed for high tackles on hooker David Paice - Conor O’Shea’s men always had their noses in front after winger Ugo Monye scored the only try of the game after 10 minutes.

‘It was frustrating,’ said Quins No 8 Nick Easter. ‘We allowed them to be niggly at the breakdown and didn’t deal with it ourselves. We need to be much better than that.’

Fly-half Nick Evans endured a poor day with the boot but still kicked 15 points while Ollie Lindsay-Hague scored Quins’ other try in an otherwise disappointing game.

London Irish also had Eamonn Sheridan sent to the sin bin in the first half.

Quins had dominated the first half with tries from Ugo Monye and replacement Ollie Lindsay-Hague and two conversions and two penalties from Evans, who could have made the win more comfortable were it not for three simple misses.

Some excellent goal-kicking from Shane Geraghty saw him succeed with five penalties but crucially Irish failed to score a try when Quins were down to 13 men. 

A late penalty from Evans saw the visitors home.

England wing Marland Yarde was the only new name in the Quins line-up as he faced his old club. Marler led the side, having taken over the club captaincy from Chris Robshaw.

In contrast, Irish had some fresh faces with former Harlequin Tom Guest, Tom Court and Samoan Dan Leo all featuring in the pack.

In the third minute, Quins had the first chance for points but Evans surprisingly missed a straightforward penalty attempt before Irish suffered two blows in quick succession.

First, Irish full back Tom Homer limped off to be replaced by Tom Fowlie before Evans give his side the lead by kicking a more difficult penalty.

Points: Shane Geraghty scored five penalties for the Exiles but it wasn't enough to complete the comeback

Irish were starved of possession in the opening 10 minutes and inevitably Quins made them pay. Charlie Matthews won a line-out before a clever flick-on by Mike Brown sent Monye flying into the corner for a try which Evans converted with a splendid kick.

It was proving to be a mixed bag on the kicking front for Evans as moments later he failed with a routine penalty so, despite totally dominating the opening quarter, Quins only led 10-0 at the end of it.

The concession of a number of penalties by the Quins allowed Irish their first foothold in the game and they were rewarded with their first points when Geraghty fired over a long-range penalty.

This proved to be only a temporary respite for the Irish as once again they suffered two setbacks in quick succession.

Centre Eamonn Sheridan was sin-binned for a deliberate offside and from the resulting penalty, Evans made no mistake.

Quins also lost a player through injury when Monye departed to be replaced by Lindsay-Hague before Matthews gave away a foolish penalty, which Geraghty kicked to briefly keep Irish in contention before Quins struck again.

They moved the ball wide allowing Nick Easter to feed Lindsay-Hague. 

The wing had little space in which to move but he easily evaded a dreadful attempt at a tackle from Topsy Ojo to score Quins' second try, which Evans converted for a healthy 20-6 interval lead.

Early in the second half, Marlar collected a yellow card for a tip tackle on David Paice, enabling Geraghty to kick his third penalty and, minutes later, Quins were down to 13 men when Sinckler was sin-binned for a high tackle on Paice.

Marlar returned in time to see Geraghty kick another penalty but Irish could not capitalise as Quins were restored to 15 men with no further damage done.

Geraghty was again on target to reduce the arrears to five points but Irish could make no further inroads and Quins held on.
