For the first time ever, Apple has pushed out a security update to all of its Mac customers automatically, without seeking prior approval first. 

A number of severe bugs were recently discovered on its OS X operating system that left it at risk of hackers.

Although Apple has had the technology to automatically update people’s computers for years, it typically asks a user’s permission before installing security updates of this kind.

Apple spokesman Bill Evans told Reuters the update is ‘seamless. It doesn't even require a restart.’

The firm added that it took these steps to protect customers as soon as possible, and an automatic update was the best way to do this.

By comparison, Microsoft has been automatically issuing updates for its Windows software for years.

The flaws were found by the Department of Homeland Security and the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute.

Apple annoyed users recently by automatically installing the latest U2 album on their devices -without their permission.

The Songs of Innocence album was automatically added to iOS devices in 119 countries. 

This caused users to take to Twitter and Facebook to express outrage at the plans.

While others moaned the album was difficult to remove from their devices. 

Apple later issued a website that helped people remove the songs from their phones and tablets in one click. 

They then published the vulnerabilities on Friday on the National Vulnerability Database.

The bug specifically targets what’s known as the network time protocol (NTP), used to synchronise clocks on computers.

The protocol is a global way of synchronising time over a network, and because of its link to networks it has previously been exploited by hackers.

Apple’s Mac software uses NTP, but it is also used by servers and other companies that run Linux software, for example.

However, no firms have reported any cases of hackers exploiting this vulnerability.

Apple's update is available for OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 and OS X Yosemite v10.10.1. 

Ken Westin, senior security analyst at Tripwire said: ‘Apple’s proactive steps to automatically remediate this particular vulnerability shows the need to quickly patch vulnerabilities.

‘However, Apple’s automatic tool is not without risks, as even the simplest update can cause problems for some systems.’

In OS X Yosemite, users can set their Mac to automatically install updates as needed (pictured). Apple's update is available for OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 and OS X Yosemite v10.10.1

In OS X Yosemite, users can set their Mac to automatically install updates as needed.

By selecting this option, the Mac installs OS X and app updates overnight as they become available. The computer then, typically, automatically restarts as part of the update process.

People who don't enable the Always Update feature are shown a notification in the Apple menu telling them updates are available. 

Automatic updates can be disabled on Macs by going to the Apple menu, App Store and unchecking ‘Install system data files and security updates’.
