Police have launched a murder investigation after a teenager was stabbed to death on an east London street.

The 15-year-old boy was walking with friends along Bethnal Green Road in Tower Hamlets, when he was attacked last night at around 11pm.

He was left with serious stab wounds to his stomach and was taken by ambulance to an east London hospital in a critical condition.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police scour the scene close to where the 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death on Bethnal Green Road in Tower Hamlets 

The teenage victim was believed to have been part of a group of youths who had been arguing with another group just before the attack 

But he was pronounced dead in hospital shortly afterwards and police say that his next of kin have been informed and a post mortem is due to take place. 

An 18-year-old man was arrested at the scene and is in custody at an east London police station today where he is being questioned.

Officers believe that the victim, who has not yet been named, was part of a group of youths who were seen arguing with the occupants of a car in Padbury Court, Tower Hamlets, just before the attack.

Police cordoned off parts of the road close to where the 15-year-old was stabbed. An 18-year-old was arrested at the scene and is currently in custody at an east London police station 

Detectives say they are especially keen to anyone who may have been in the Bethnal Green area around the time of the stabbing 

The altercation then continued as the group moved on to the nearby Gibraltar Walk.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Jones, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command at the Metropolitan Police, said: 'Anyone who may have witnessed this altercation or have information which may assist the investigation is asked to contact the police as soon as possible.'

Detectives are especially keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed an altercation just before the incident between a group of male youths on foot and the occupants of a car.

Anyone with information can contact police on 0208 345 3734 or speak to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
