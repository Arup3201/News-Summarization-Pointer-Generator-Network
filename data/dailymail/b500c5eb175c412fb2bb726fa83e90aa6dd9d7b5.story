A police dog was shot in the face and the bullet traveled all the way through his body until lodging in one of his lungs during a shoot-out... but he miraculously survived.

Bruno, a 7-year-old Sable German Shephard with the Anaheim, California, police was with his partner, Officer RJ Young, following an incident involving probation officers.

When the probation officers arrived at the home of a man they were checking on, he was with two friends, who ran.

Although the officers did not chase the men, one officer walked down an alley to see if he could spot them, Anaheim Police spokesman Lt. Tim Schmidt told KTLA.

When the officer found one of the men, the suspect shot three or four times at the officer, forcing him to take cover. They then radioed for backup from the Anaheim Police Department, who also sent a SWAT team in. Two schools nearby the scene were placed on lockdown.

Nearly an hour after the police were searching for the men, Bruno found one of the them hiding by a trash bin in the courtyard of a nearby apartment complex, according to the Orange County Register. He then fired several shots at the dog and officers, with one of the bullets striking Bruno in the mouth by his jaw. At least one officer returned fire, striking the suspect, killing him.

Police have not identified the dead man, his friend, or the probationer. However, they said all three are suspected gang members. The probationer was in custody, but the other man escaped capture.

Officer Young took his inured partner to the Yorba Linda Regional Animal Hospital, where Bruno underwent surgery. Since the round entered Bruno's chest area, veterinarians had to remove part of his lung.

Around 9p, Anaheim Police posted on their Twitter page that Bruno made it through surgery and is expected to survive. It is uncertain when or even whether he will return to duty again. With six years of experience, Bruno the most senior K9 on the force.

Other police departments are sending Bruno well wishes. Thursday night, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck tweeted, 'Great to hear @AnaheimPD K9 Bruno is out of surgery. Well wishes from #LAPD for his full recovery and back to work with his partner.'

Police in Denton,Texas also tweeted, '@AnaheimPD glad to hear! K-9 Gino & his handler as well as the rest of DPD sends our thoughts and prayers out to K-9 Bruno & his handler.'
