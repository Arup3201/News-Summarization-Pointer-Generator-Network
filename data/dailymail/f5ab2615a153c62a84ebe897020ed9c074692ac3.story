A terrified neighborhood of Oakland, California has paid for private security guards to protect themselves after a raft of violent shootings.

There have been 61 murders in the city so far this year, and the horrific violence has prompted the once-friendly and seemingly safe area of Maxwell Park to take their safety into their own hands.

The gunfire is so common, 'it's like, "Oh, another shooting,"' Jan Hetherington, who has lived for 14 years in the Oakland neighborhood, which has sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay, told CBS News.

Victim: Judy Salamon, 66, pictured, was murdered last month on her way home from work. The murder prompted Maxwell Park residents to hire private security

No answers: Police have not identified Salamon's killer or a motive for the seemingly senseless slaying

She added: 'This is the most wonderful neighborhood I've ever lived in.'

Yet last month her next door neighbor, Judy Salamon, was murdered as she drove home from work.

'Our neighbor Judy, who lived in the next block to me, was shot and killed,' Hetherington told CBS.

Who killed the 66-year-old dog walker and why is still unknown.

Hetherington described another incident where 'a car came down the street, three guys got out with a gun. There was a gun battle three blocks over. And I did hear actually a bullet went through somebody's house.'

Peaceful: The once peaceful neighborhood, pictured, was immune to the city's violence until police numbers were cut recently

The gunfire has prompted the neighborhood to bring in private security to patrol the area, following budget cuts that forced Oakland to reduce its police force by a third.

They believe if Salamon could be murdered in such an indiscriminate way, it could happen to anyone.

In another frightening incident, Pastor Gregg Brown, who moved to Maxwell Park nine years ago, said he was threatened at gunpoint right outside his Lutheran church.

'I was scared and I'm still scared,' he told CBS.

Patrols: The private security patrols will begin in two weeks

The gunman complained about the noise of the power washer Brown was using to clean the church sidewalk, screaming at him to stop or he'd shoot.

'That's how close the crime is,' Brown said.

Another resident, Joyce Nichelini, 81, has lived in Maxwell Park for 42 years but she said the neighborhood has changed and she now fears for her life.

'I lock a gate now and I lock my door and I have alarms. I even put bars on my house,' she said, adding that she still doesn't feel safe.

The private security patrols will begin in a couple of weeks, and residents are hoping it will help them all sleep at night.
