'He had a wonderfully original mind and will be greatly missed.'

Mr Lloyd, who was married three times including to Joanna Lumley, created a string of hit shows with his writing partner David Croft.

He was given an OBE for services to comedy in 2012. Accepting his OBE, Lloyd said he was 'astounded' to be honoured for doing something he enjoyed.

He said: 'it is, after all, what I love doing and couldn’t have done without the many wonderful actors, directors and others who made my work come to life.' 

Writing about their marriage, which lasted less than a year, Lumley said: 'He was witty, tall and charming - we should have just had a raging affair'

Lloyd began his career as a writer in 1958 before making his film debut two years later in 1960 in School for Scoundrels.

He appeared in numerous comedies during the 1960s and 1970s and was a regular performer on US show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In in 1969.

Lloyd starred in two films with the Beatles, including a Hard Day's Night in 1964 and in Help! in 1965.

In 1969 he filmed a scene with Peter Sellers for The Magic Christian, which co-starred Ringo Starr.

His first major success as a comedy writer was with Are You Being Served? in 1972, on which he worked with David Croft. 

They subsequently produced 'Allo 'Allo! and a spinoff of Are You Being Served?, Grace & Favour which aired in 1992.

Jeremy also wrote the poem for the popular Captain Beaky album and books in 1980.

Jeremy played the eccentric chimney sweep, Berthram Fortesque Wynthrope-Smythe aka Bert Smith in The Avengers episode, From Venus With Love in 1967.

In 1974 he was a British Army officer in Murder on the Orient Express. 

He worked as a paint salesman and a road digger before getting into showbusiness and enjoyed a screen career of his own before devoting himself to providing the lines for others.

He made his film debut in School For Scoundrels and had minor roles in the Beatles films Help!, released in 1965, and A Hard Day's Night, released in 1964.

He also featured in classics such as Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines in 1965. 

He also had roles in Doctor in Clover with James Robertson Justice, and The Wrong Box with John Mills, Michael Caine and Peter Cook.

In 1974 he was a British Army officer in Murder on the Orient Express.

Lloyd was later a regular writer and performer on popular US show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.

Mr Lloyd said he got the job after answering the phone at his agent's office to the show's producer, George Schlatter, who was looking for someone who could act and write.

He explained: 'I said "The best possible person you could get is Jeremy Lloyd and we handle him". 

'And George said "Is he available?" And I said: "I'll just check his book... just a second... he's got a day off from filming tomorrow and he can see you."

'I wasn't filming at all, of course. "Can he be at the Dorchester at 9?" And I said "Don't worry, I'll make sure he's there."'

Mr Lloyd, the son of an army officer and a dancer, was born in London but brought up in Manchester by his grandmother.

He regularly appeared on the hugely popular Billy Cotton Band Show playing what he described as 'an idiot in a bowler hat' and - more importantly - it was where he met Croft.

They teamed up on a short-lived sitcom It's Awfully Bad For Your Eyes Darling, which starred Lumley, before working up an idea based on Lloyd's past experiences working at Simpsons of Piccadilly, which became Are You Being Served?, set in the fictional Grace Brothers store. 

Its run spanned 13 years and attracted audiences of up to 22million. It became known for its catchphrase 'I’m free!; as well as Mrs Slocombe’s ongoing dramas with a high maintenance pussy cat.

They worked on further shows such as Come Back Mrs Noah and Oh Happy Band, then struck comedy gold again with 'Allo 'Allo! about the French Resistance, which lasted the best part of a decade.

At various times, he also wrote for Jon Pertwee, Morecambe and Wise, Bruce Forsyth and Lionel Blair 

Writing about their marriage, which lasted less than a year, Lumley said: 'He was witty, tall and charming - we should have just had a raging affair.'

His third marriage, to interior designer Lizzy Moberley, took place in central London this June.

He said his third bride, who was 49 when they tied the knot, was 'beautiful, clever and sent from heaven on mission impossible'.

He was previously due to marry actress Carole Ashby - who played Louise in Allo Allo - but they split in 1990 after a three-year engagement.

Lloyd was also briefly engaged to actress Charlotte Rampling, who later acted as his best man when he married Lizzie Moberley. 

Lloyd was also behind an unlikely hit record in the shape of Captain Beaky which went into the top five in 1980. It was the most well-known hit from two albums produced by the band in 1977 and 1980.

The albums led to numerous spinoffs, including two books of poetry, a BBC television shows, a West End musical and a pantomime. The Captain Beaky poems were revived in an all-star tribute show at the Royal Albert Hall in 2011, featuring Joanna Lumley. 

The writer also claimed to have been invited to Sharon Tate’s house for tea on the night that she was murdered by followers of Charles Manson.
