England will encounter an old Ashes foe as they begin the final approach to their World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand early next year.

Former Australia batsman Mike Hussey is to captain a Prime Minister's XI against England in the annual tourists' fixture in Canberra on January 14, England's second warm-up match before the start of the tri-series against the hosts and India - itself followed by the World Cup, between February 14 and the end of March.

Thirty-nine-year-old Hussey said: 'It's a tremendous honour to be selected to captain the Prime Minister's XI.

'Having played in the Prime Minister's XI before, I know how important this fixture is on the Australian cricketing calendar, and it is a great tradition.

'In the past two years Ricky Ponting and Brett Lee have been captains of the team, so it's humbling to follow in the footsteps of two icons of Australian cricket.'
