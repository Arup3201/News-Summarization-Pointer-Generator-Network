Ever found the notes returned from an airport currency deal a bit thin on the ground?

A new report revealed yesterday that UK holidaymakers are losing almost £20m a year in spending money by choosing to buy a foreign currency last minute in the airport.

The Holiday Confidence Index reveals that the number of travellers who wait until they are at the airport to change their money has doubled to four per cent, despite airport currency rates being universally more costly.

Sun-seekers heading for the beaches of Spain or Greece can be £25 poorer from an average transaction of £360 when buying euros at an airport Bureau de Change.

And holidaymakers heading to the US can be $40 down, while travellers booked to fly Down Under are AU$50 dollars poorer.

The study by Debenhams found the rates offered at airports over a week seven per cent lower over a week, when compared with buying in advance on the High Street.

With an estimated 850,000 travellers obtaining currency just before they fly - that's a potential substantial saving which would pay for a meal of two in most resorts.

'People quite rightly spend weeks preparing for their holiday, comparing the cost of flights and accommodation to get the best value, but many forget about the cash they need when they reach their destination'' said Director of Debenhams Personal Finance, Mike Hazel.

'Leaving it to the last minute really is a bad choice if you are looking to get the most from your hard-earned pounds.'

And it seems confidence is up among British travellers this year.

More than three-quarters of holidaymakers intend to take the same amount of currency or more on their travels as last year, according to the Holiday Confidence Index - compiled  by the Institute of Travel and Tourism, the University of Wolverhampton and pollster YouGov.
