Yesterday marked the 20 year anniversary of the Battle of Mogadishu. Two decades later, never-before-seen footage has been released of the operation that was depicted in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down.

The footage was obtained by CBS' 60 Minutes and will air this Sunday as part of a special segment on the mission that went awry in the capital of Somalia.

From 1993 to 1995, the United Nations had an operation in Somalia to create enough peace to continue humanitarian operations for civilians.

Declassified: CBS' 60 Minutes will air never-before-seen footage from the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu this Sunday. The video shows the moment a black hawk helicopter is shot down in enemy territory, stranding U.S. soldiers for hours

Witness: Norm Hooten, above, was a Special Operations team leader during the mission on October 3, 1993, and called the helicopter crash 'catastrophic'

It was a part of this operation that on October 3, 1993, that 160 soldiers, consisting mostly of U.S. army rangers, conducted a raid in Mogadishu to capture two high-level lieutenants working for the warlord and president-to-be Mohamed Farrah Aidid.

Norm Hooten, who was a Special Operations team leader on the mission, told 60 Minutes that the mission was 'flawless' until the moment they were ready to be airlifted out of the city.

The video shows a black hawk helicopter 'Super 61' pass across the screen to land in the street when it's hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.

Taking a turn: Mr Hooten said the mission was 'flawless' until the black hawks returned to the city to transport the soldiers back to base. Above, enemy combatants stationed on a rooftop

Strike: The Somali militia aimed well and were able to shoot down two black hawk helicopters, stranding soldiers in the city overnight. Above, the helicopter called Super 61 moments before it crashes

'It took a direct hit to the tail boom and started a slow rotation,' Hooten said. 'It was a catastrophic impact. That's the only way I can describe it.'

The video continues to follow Super 61 as it slowly rotates to the ground and crashes right in the heart of enemy territory.

What was meant to be an hour-long raid turned into an over-night fight with combatants of the Somali National Alliance that eventually ended with the deaths of 19 U.S. soldiers.

On screen: A movie was made about the mission in 2001, based on the book by journalist Mark Bowden

In 1999, journalist Mark Bowden published a book about the mission based on a series of articles he wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer, which was in turn adapted into a film in 2001 starring Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana and Ewan McGregor.

Many have considered the fight to be the first battle between the United States and al Qaeda.

The United Nations operation in Somalia did not bring lasting peace to the area. Today, the country is as dangerous as ever - now being run mostly by Islamic militant group al Shabab.

60 Minutes will also show one former Army intelligence officer's efforts to recover the  wreckage of Super 61 and transport them back the the U.S.

David Snelson and his wife Alisha Ryu have been living in Mogadishu for the past three years and decided to save the wrecked helicopter when they heard that new construction was planned for the crash site.

'Above anything else, you think about the men...what they went through,' Mr Snelson said. 'We didn't do this for anybody else but them.'

In the end, Mr Snelson and his wife were able to save some the wreckage and now Super 61's rotor blade and foot pedals are in the Airborne and Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

Army Rangers: Many of the men involved in the mission were from Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment - pictured above
