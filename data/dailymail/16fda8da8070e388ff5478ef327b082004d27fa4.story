Prime Minister Tony Abbott has copped a ribbing from Today Show presenter Karl Stefanovic after he looked a little a dusty the morning after his important night with Japanese PM Shinzo Abe.The Channel Nine breakfast show host observed that Mr Abbott might have had a few too many Sakes with Mr Abe after signing agreements to boost trade and defence ties between Australia and Japan.

Mr Abbott celebrated the deal with his 'good friend' Mr Abe at a formal dinner at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday night and appeared on the Today Show in a live link from Canberra at 7.16am on Wednesday.

'You look a little bit worse for wear if you don't mind me saying so PM. You didn't get on the Sakes with the Japanese PM ?,' Stefanovic asked.

Dusty? Prime Minister Tony Abbott was grilled about his appearance on the Today Show by Karl Stefanovic on Wednesday morning after the PM's big night with the Japanese PM

Mr Abbott laughed and admitted he had indeed had a very lively night.

'Look the truth is it was a very convivial dinner last night, very convivial. I accept that,' he confessed.

Pushed on just how many alcoholic drinks he'd had, the PM wouldn't say.

Instead, he explained: 'It was also as you'd expect, a very responsible dinner too.'

Earlier on Tuesday Mr Abbott tweeted: 'Great to welcome my good friend @AbeShinzo - Aust & Japan have forged a firm friendship & a practical partnership.'

During the dinner the PM said Japanese firms invest in Australia because of a decades-long relationship built on trust.

Cheers: The signing of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement comes close to the anniversary of Australia's 1957 commerce agreement with Japan

'Based on investment figures, after the US and UK, no one trusts Australia more than Japan,' Mr Abbott explained.

'And that trust is amply reciprocated.'

The signing of the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement comes close to the anniversary of Australia's 1957 commerce agreement with Japan.

The pact was the springboard for the strong trade ties that now exist, and without it, Australia would not have the strong iron ore and gas industries it currently boasts, Mr Abbott said.

Worried: Stefanovic appeared concerned Abbott's possible hangover on Wednesday morning

Mr Abe continued the charm offensive after a much-lauded speech to parliament earlier in the day, complimenting the Australian wine at the dinner held in his honour.

'I told myself I shouldn't drink too much wine. But I couldn't beat out with the greatest wine from Australia,' he told the gathering, adding the trade pact would now allow his country access to cheaper Australian wine and beef.

Mr Abe also touched on political issues, arguing the two countries should work together towards regional peace efforts.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten praised Japan's post-World War II recovery to become an economic powerhouse.

Australia had much to learn from Japan's experience going from an industrial to a more developed economy, he said.

Mr Abbott will accompany Mr Abe on a tour of the Pilbara region on Wednesday, with a visit to mining giant Rio Tinto's West Angelas mine.

Mr Abe and wife Akie arrived in Canberra on Monday night for the first bilateral visit by a Japanese leader in 12 years.

The main benefit for Australian consumers of the new economic partnership agreement will be the reduced cost of Japanese cars, international trade expert Alan Oxley told MailOnline.

'The government has indicated there's a tariff of 5 to 8 per cent that will come off automobiles,' Mr Oxley, principal of ITS Global, said.

Australian Automobile Association chief Andrew McKellar said Japan was the largest source of imported vehicles in Australia and made up about 30 per cent of the market.

'We would estimate [the trade deal] would reduce the amount of tax payable on a new car by about $1000 to $2000,' Mr McKellar added.

'For a larger vehicle like a [Toyota] Land Cruiser the saving is probably closer to $3000.'

Toyota is the top selling Japanese brand in Australia but Mazda, Nissan, Honda and Subaru also have significant sales in Australia, he said.

Mr Oxley said Japanese electronics and whitegoods are also set to become cheaper, but the tariffs on these goods are much lower than the tariff on cars so the difference will not be as substantial.
