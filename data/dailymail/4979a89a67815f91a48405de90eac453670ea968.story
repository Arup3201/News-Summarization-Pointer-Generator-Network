A volunteer at a Houston-area elementary school who noticed some students were getting a smaller lunch of cold cheese sandwiches is digging into his own pocket to cover $465 in delinquent meal accounts so all the kids can get the same full lunch tray.

'These are elementary school kids,' Thompson, a tutor and mentor at Valley Oaks Elementary in Houston's Spring Branch School District.

'They don't need to be worried about finances. They need to be worried about what grade they got in spelling.'

Kenny Thompson: A tutor and mentor at a school in Houston has helped out 60 schoolchildren by paying for their lunches because their parents had fallen behind with the payments

Helping hand: Kenny noticed that those who had negative balances on their lunch accounts -- were receiving different lunches than the other kids; cold cheese sandwiches, instead of a full tray of food

Thompson, a volunteer for 10 years, said he asked about the lunch differences at his school after hearing about some Utah students who last week had meals taken from them because of non-payment.

Mr Thompson saw dozens of children forced to eat cold lunch, he opened his wallet. He didn't just buy them lunch for the day. He paid off their overdue accounts.

Opening his wallet: This isn¿t the end of Thompson¿s giving: He¿s already targeted another school with students he¿d like to help out

He had to help: Thompson believes school lunch is one of the most basic and, therefore, important elements of education. It¿s the one meal the school system can guarantee, and studies show inadequate nutrition can affect classroom performance

Generous gesture: Kenny Thompson saw dozens of children forced to eat cold lunch, he opened his wallet. He didn't just buy them lunch for the day. He paid off their overdue accounts. Here he is with his wife who is also a teacher at the school

Thompson believes school lunch is one of the most basic and, therefore, important elements of education. It’s the one meal the school system can guarantee, and studies show inadequate nutrition can affect classroom performance.

'The one meal we can control in the school is lunch.'

Salt Lake City school officials have apologized for removing the lunches and embarrassing the students, and say they are revising procedures to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Thompson told the TV station that he asked about the smaller meals at his school and learned more than 60 children were on reduced lunches because parents couldn't afford the 40-cent daily fee.

Valley Oaks Elementary: Students and school administrators at Valley Oaks have openly expressed gratitude for Thompson¿s efforts, he said. One of his mentees broke down and cried when he heard the news

Some students whose parents hadn’t paid were eating cold cheese or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch, instead of hot, hearty fare.

He believes some of the students avoided the lunch line altogether to avoid embarrassment, meaning they weren't getting proper daily nutrition.

Students and school administrators at Valley Oaks have openly expressed gratitude for Thompson’s efforts, he said. One of his mentees broke down and cried when he heard the news, sharing how he used to avoid the lunch line and claim he wasn’t hungry to avoid any questions.

Other adults have been inspired by Thompson’s kindness too. He’s already heard of one woman who went into the school district office, expressing her desire to pay off accounts just like 'the man on TV.' He hopes that others will do the same.

'They say everything’s bigger in Texas,' Thompson said. 'That means our hearts too.

'When I left the building knowing that they were getting fed, they didn't have that stress ... the best money I ever spent,' Thompson said.
