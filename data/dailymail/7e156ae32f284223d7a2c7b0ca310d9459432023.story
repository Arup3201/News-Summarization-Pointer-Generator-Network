The mystery surrounding North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's disappearance from the spotlight deepened today when he failed to show for a Workers' Party anniversary celebration.

It was the first time in three years Kim hadn't attended the event in Pyongyang, which today marked the party's 69th anniversary.

But while Kim wasn't there in person, a flower basket with his name on it was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, both of whom also ruled North Korea.

Kim Jong Un was absent from the Workers' Party 69th anniversary celebrations in Pyongyang today, but a flower basket baring his name was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, as were other baquets from North Koreans

It was the first time in three years, Kim hadn't attended the event amid reports his sister has taken over leadership as he recovers from a leg injury

His absence comes as speculation mounts that his sister, Kim Yo-jong, 24, who is Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has taken over the leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury.

The 31-year-old hasn't been seen in public since September 3. He had been walking with a limp and was more overweight than usual in images that aired before that.

An official documentary from late last month described him as dealing with 'discomfort', which led to international speculation that he may be ill. 

In Seoul, Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong Cheol said that Kim appears to still be in charge of key affairs. He noted that a high-level North Korean delegation conveyed a greetings message to South Korean President Park Geun-hye during their surprise visit to South Korea last week.

State media, later reported Kim was suffering from unspecified 'discomfort'. Sources have claimed the dictator had hurt his leg when he joined generals he had ordered to perform physical drills, and required 100 days to recover. 

North Korea has said nothing publicly about Kim's absence. But it is not the first time he has taken a break from the media spotlight - Kim wasn't seen publicly for about three weeks in 2012, South Korean officials say.  

He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship previously said

Because Pyongyang is publicly acknowledging Kim's 'discomfort', many analysts believe that he's unlikely to be suffering from anything particularly serious. When his father, Kim Jong Il, suffered major health problems late in his rule, state media said nothing.

But each day that passes only adds to the speculation. Kim missed a meeting of the country's parliament late last month, and was absent again from a gathering this week to mark his late father's election as ruling party head.  

Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, appeared to suggest Ms Kim had taken control. 

He told The Telegraph: 'Kim's sister may be young, but she has taken up some of the key leadership positions in North Korea, relying on the family name and bloodline to have her instructions carried out.

'No-one can touch the Kim family and it doesn't matter that she is young, inexperienced and a woman. She is a Kim and that's enough.'

According to South Korea's JoongAng Daily, Ms Kim is already in charge of her brother's daily schedule, 'as well as coordinating every detail of his fashion and hair style'.

Health fear: Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011

Prior to the emergence of the latest claims, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership insisted Kim was in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over his health and grip on power.

The source said that Kim had just taken a step out of the limelight because of his leg injury.

'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 

'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon.

'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight.

'He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said. 

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury. 

He was last seen attending a concert with his wife Ri Sol-ju on September 3 but has vanished from public since

Kim has not been pictured by state media, which chronicles his whereabouts in great detail, since September 3

'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. 

North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble. 

Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'.

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.

The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'.

'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.

North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye. 

 

Shots fired across border after activists urge North Korea to rise up against 'dictator' Kim

North and South Korea exchanged machinegun fire today after the Communist state took objection to balloons loaded with leaflets condemning Kim Jong Un.

No casualties were reported in the exchange of fire, a sign of the tensions which sill exist between the two states. 

They remain legally at war and are separated by the Demilitarized Zone, known as the DMZ. 

North Korean defectors launched balloons from the South today to send across leaflets and DVDs condemning the regime of Kim Jong Un, as well as American dollars

The balloons carried bags of leaflets and anti-Kim DVDs underneath. But they prompted North Korean border troops to fire across the border, which led to an exchange of fire 

South Korean activists had sent leaflets critical of the North Korean regime flying into the North from the town, prompting shots to be fired by the North's guards to try to bring down the balloons.

South Korea's military returned fire after hearing the sound of the North's machinegun fire, the official said.

Some rounds fell on the South side which then responded with high-calibre machine gun fire 'towards the North's guard posts,' a defence ministry spokesman said.

There was a further exchange of fire 10 minutes later, he added.

Local residents of Hwangsan-ri township in the border area of Yeoncheon were evacuated to shelters as a precaution.

While naval confrontations along the Koreas' disputed maritime border occur from time to time, any military engagement across the heavily-militarised land frontier is extremely rare.

In 2010, the North shelled the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong, killing four people and briefly sparking fears of a full scale conflict.

The balloon launch from Hapsuri was one of several planned to coincide with North Korea's celebration today of the 69th anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party.

Seoul allowed the exercises to go ahead, despite prior warnings from Pyongyang of 'catastrophic' consequences.

Some of the balloons carried messages denouncing North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, who has not seen seen in public for more than a month.

North Korea has reacted angrily to leaflet drops by South Korean private groups that carried messages attacking the authoritarian leadership in Pyongyang, vowing to attack them but has never taken action to follow up on the threat.

'This is the first time North Korea actually took an action against leaflets. It spilt cold water over the South-North relationship after the high-level delegation visit from North. It will strain the relations again,' said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said.

On Tuesday, a South Korean naval ship fired warning shots after a North Korean patrol boat crossed a disputed sea border off the peninsula's west coast and fired shots back before retreating, a South Korean defence official said.

There were no casualties on the South Korean side and none of the shots by either side was aimed at the other's vessel, he told Reuters. 

Evidence of the shots fired by North Korea could be seen on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone which separates the two states, including this bullet hole (centre). Both sides are technically still at war
