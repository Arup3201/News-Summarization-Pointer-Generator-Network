'Super honey': A new type of honey has produced amazing results treating wounds and infections

A new honey has been produced that has had ‘amazing’ results treating wounds and infections.

The bio-engineered product Surgihoney was tested on babies, new mothers, cancer patients and the elderly for over a year in Hampshire hospitals.

Wounds and ulcers, including those infected with the superbug MRSA, healed within days, while the number of women who suffered infections after giving birth by caesarean section has halved.

It has also healed the wounds of soldiers returning from Afghanistan, and been used to treat acne and to protect the skin of cancer patients fitted with a catheter for chemotherapy.

Dr Matthew Dryden, consultant microbiologist at the Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘It will revolutionise wound care around the world.’

Honey has been used for its healing powers for thousands of years, although doctors favour penicillin and antibiotics.

However, Surgihoney, which is stored in 10g sachets, can kill bacteria, parasites and fungal infections while also encouraging wounds to heal.

Dr Dryden said: ‘I have conducted numerous laboratory tests and compared it with honeys from around the world.

‘I found Surgihoney better for treating every type of bug. So for the past year I have been using it on patients and the results have been amazing.

'There are plenty of products that can kill bacteria but they often don’t help heal tissue.

‘Honey is a fantastic natural medicine. The important extra is that it kills the bugs but doesn’t damage the tissue.’

Effective: The honey has helped patients suffering from MRSA

Surgihoney is being developed by Ian Staples, a businessman who once owned the Halfords motor accessories chain.

He bought an organic farm in southern Chile, set up beehives then funded scientific researchers in Ireland to identify the unique health elements.

The honey has been licensed  by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority in the UK but is not yet commercially available.
