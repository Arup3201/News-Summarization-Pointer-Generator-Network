It was integral to the counterculture of the 1960’s, but it seems the Kombi bus has now become a symbol of wealth.

A restored 1960 Volkswagen Kombi Samba bus sold for a staggering $202,000 on Monday night at a south-east Melbourne collectibles auction.

Believed to be one of just three examples delivered to Australia in this configuration, the 23-window Kombi  sparked a wild bidding frenzy at the Shannons Auctions in Cheltenham, nabbing a record price for the vehicle in Australia.

The Kombi, introduced in 1950 by Volkswagon, was nicknamed the 'Hippie Van' in the 1960's due to its popularity in the counterculture movement. 

Since production of the vehicle was ceased in late 2013 due to environmental legislation, they've become a sought after collectors item among auto-mobile enthusiasts.  

The auctioned Kombi had undergone some $100,000 of restoration over half a decade. It won several awards at Day Of The Volkswagens competition in November, including presidents choice & best in class. 

Auction manager Christophe Boribon told Daily Mail Australia the restoration process involved the entire car.  

 The van is now presented in two-tone period colours of Paprika and White with a contrasting tan upholstery

‘They redid the body, paint, interior and mechanicals. It was a complete rebuild,’ he said.

Mr Boribon said the auction was fiercely competitive.

‘The bidding started at $100,000. Between a crowd of 600 on the floor, and several hundred internet and phone bidders, prices quickly rose to $150,000.' 

A phone bidder eventually took the prize.

Mr Boribon said a Kombi revival has been gaining traction over recent years, with enthusiasts of other vehicles 'developing a soft spot' for the vans. 

The sale comes after a string of lucrative Kombi sales in Australia. Last year, a battered Kombi went under the hammer for $30,000.

A restored Kombi was auctioned off for $74,000 in late December.
