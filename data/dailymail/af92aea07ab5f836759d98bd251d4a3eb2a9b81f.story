In the lead up to the nation's hottest month, two huge red bellied black snakes have been captured in an intricate act of aggression in one of Sydney's most popular parks.

The snakes were shown writhing in a corkscrew motion at the popular Lake Parramatta reserve, in Sydney's Western suburbs. 

The reserve was officially opened this week for swimming, causing some to worry about the dangers of snakes in the area ahead of what is anticipated to be a busy weekend.

The video was shot by Carmen Bennett, a North Parramatta local, who said that she shared the footage, taken in September, to illustrate that the area was home to many of the red bellied residents.

'I want people to enjoy their time at Lake Parramatta, but I also want them to stay safe and be aware of the red-bellied black snakes which are in their natural habitats, so there’s no warning signs to say what to do if you’re bit by them,' Ms Bennett told The Daily Telegraph. 

'It’s (the video is) to say, look come and really enjoy the lake and the wildlife and reserve, but please be aware of the dangers of the snakes and also the dangers of swimming in the lake,' she said. 

The 60 hectare bush and parkland reserve is a popular destination for families and nature enthusiasts alike, and has at least 12 species of reptiles within it's borders.

The red bellied black snake, while one of the two most common snakes in Western Sydney, is not as dangerous as it's exterior might indicate.

Red bellied black snakes can grow up to six foot long and are extremely common to the area

Raymond 'Snakeman' Hoser, a reptile expert based in Melbourne, said that red bellied black snakes can grow up to six foot long and are extremely common to the area. 

'The snakes are fighting in a corkscrew position. What would normally happen is that they would be fighting over females, but sometimes they fight just when they come up to one another,' said Raymond.

'The peak mating season would be from August until November, which explains this behaviour, but they are still very common during this time of the year and will be moving around,' he said. 

Raymond, of snake and reptile show Snakebusters, said that red bellied black snakes are not likely to bite, and are actually one of the most docile species in the country.

'I've caught thousands of them, and they just don't bite. They are very fast, and will run away, but even if you catch them they most likely won't have a go at you,' he said.

Raymond said that he would warn people do not 'muck with' snakes, and to either walk away if they see one or simply observe it

'However if people do get bitten it's often because they've been interfering with the snake.'

Raymond said that he would warn people do not 'muck with' snakes, and to either walk away if they see one or simply observe it.

'Sydney is very urbanised, so the likelihood of seeing one of them isn't high, and if you do, just step back and admire it,' he said.

'Scaremongering and snakes go together, but unless you're really interfering with them, they're very casual.'

One of the more significant problems tends to be with domesticated pets being bitten by snakes. 

The Parramatta Lake Reserve will open officially for swimming at 10am on Saturday, and lifeguards will be patrolling the area from 9am to 5pm on weekends until March

Australia Lifeguard Service manager Brett Manieri warned members of the public who were anticipating swimming in the reserve to swim between the buoys

'Contrary to popular belief, most people are sensible, they'll walk away when they see a snake. Dogs and cats on the other hand are at higher risk because they see an animal and they want to kill it,' Raymond said.

He said there would be an average of ten to 20 snake bites every day in Sydney, incidents which cost an average of $8000 to treat because of how expensive the anti-venom is.

'If you live in an area where there is bush, keep your yard clean and presentable,' Raymond advised.

Australia Lifeguard Service manager Brett Manieri warned members of the public who were anticipating swimming in the reserve to swim between the buoys.

'Council have done a lot of work to ensure that there is a safe area that people will be swimming in,' Mr Manieri told The Daily Telegraph.

'The water can be deeper than what people think, that’s one thing with lakes that you can have steep drops,' he said. 

Lake Parramatta is located in Sydney's Western suburbs and is open from this weekend for swimming
