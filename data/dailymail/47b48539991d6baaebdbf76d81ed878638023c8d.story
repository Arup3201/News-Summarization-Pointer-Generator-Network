Jodi Arias answered question after question from the jury on Wednesday as they contemplate her fate in the death penalty case over the killing of her on-off boyfriend.

In the state of Arizona, jurors are allowed to ask questions of witnesses during a criminal trial. The panel in Arias' trial had about 100 questions after her 15 days on the witness stand.

Judge Sherry Stephens read them one-by-one aloud to Arias, who responded with calm, concise answers in the Phoenix courtroom.

Filling in the gaps: Jurors at Jodi Arias murder trial had around 100 questions for the suspect as she took the stand in the Phoenix courtroom today

One juror focused on why she didn't call police after she claimed Travis Alexander had repeatedly physically abused her in the months leading up to this death.

The questions provided a glimpse into the panel's thoughts after hearing her testify about practically every detail of her life, from a self-described, abusive childhood in California to her stormy romance with Alexander and her conversion to the Mormon faith.

Jurors asked her about past relationships with other men and how it could have been so easy for her to get a gun from the victim's closet as they fought on the day of the killing and he chased her in a fury.

Jurors also wanted to know why she tried to clean the bloody scene at Alexander's home and a number of questions focused on her memory lapses on June 4, 2008.

Arias said: ‘I don’t have an adequate explanation for my state of mind.'

She later added: 'I can’t really explain why my mind did what it did maybe because it’s too horrible. I really don’t know the answer why I blacked out and have memory gaps on that day.’

She explained another question, which asked how she remembered every sexual encounter but did not remember stabbing Travis and dragging his body into the shower, by saying: 'I don’t know how the mind works but I know
June 4 was the most traumatic experience of my life.

'I don’t have other
blackouts, I have a very good memory. The only way I can explain it is 
like a computer screen that freezes... you hit the keys but nothing 
happens.

One juror posed the question as to whether Jodi had ever sought treatment for her 'mental condition'. 

The defendant looked confused before responding: ' I'm not sure what mental condition that refers to.'

Explanations: Arias, 32, gave detailed responses to questions from the jury with many queries focusing on why she did not remember much of June 4, 2008, the day that Travis Alexander was killed

Several queries were related to her 
Mormon faith. 'Why were the laws of attraction so 
important to follow and the law of chastity was not?’

Arias said: 'I believed I was following the law of chastity for a long time - I realize now I was not... There was a lot of temptation and weakness when it came to hanging out with Travis.’

There were more general questions about Arias' personality in other relationships as she answered for the entire day in court. 

‘Do you feel the guys in your life cheated because you were controlling?' one juror wanted to know.

Arias said: ‘I feel it was the 
opposite. I feel they cheated because I was too tolerant, naive and 
implicitly trusting. I gave them freedom and took advantage.’

Jurors had dozens of questions for the murder suspect over the details of the day that Alexander was killed.

Arias said she grabbed the gun from 
Alexander's closet as he came after her, but she didn't know for certain
if he was right behind her.

'I just had the sense that he was chasing me,' she said.

After
killing Alexander, Arias took photos of his bloody body and then put 
the camera in his washing machine. The jury asked her why she did that.

'I don't know why I would have done that,' she said.

One juror wanted to know why it had taken Arias two years to admit to killing 28-year-old Alexander at his Mesa home.

She responded: 'I was deeply ashamed, I was horrified with myself. A lot of people believed in my stupid story, I felt fraudulent.

'It started off as a secret that I wanted to take to my grave with me... but it became a really yucky feeling inside.'

Arias faces the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder. She says 
the killing was self-defense, and hopes that the jury spares her the 
death penalty by convicting her of a lesser murder count.

Stephens
and attorneys worked on Wednesday morning to whittle down the list of 
questions for Arias as objections were raised in private.

Many other states, including California, allow jury questions at the judge's discretion, but not all agree it's a good idea.

'It
becomes too difficult, too tempting for a juror to lose their role as 
an impartial fact-finder and slip into the role of an advocate, and I 
think that's contrary to what the whole justice system is based upon,' 
said Los Angeles-area defense attorney Mark Geragos.

'In effect, you've deputized the jurors as investigators,' Geragos added.

Others, however, say the practice is a 
useful tool aimed at getting to the truth of a case, and provides 
attorneys on both sides a window in the deliberation room while the 
trial is still ongoing, giving lawyers time to change their strategies.

Phoenix criminal defense attorney Julio Laboy said the questions of a witness, during a case where he was representing a client charged with murder, once led to prosecutors offering a deal to plead to a lesser count.

'In the end, what this is all really about is the search for truth, and any mechanism that allows jurors to get closer to the truth without prejudicing one side or the other, I think, is a good tool,' Laboy said.

'And it really is a window into the juror's mindset,' he added. 'It can help attorneys direct which way you need to go, what path you should take.'

Arias initially told authorities she had nothing to do with Alexander's death then blamed it on masked intruders before settling on self-defense.

Her repeated lies to authorities, friends and family in the days after his death, and her methodical efforts to create an alibi and avoid suspicion have been center stage throughout the trial as she explained how she remembers little from the day of the killing.

Alexander had been shot in the head, stabbed 27 times and had his throat slit.

None of Arias' allegations have been corroborated by witnesses or evidence during the trial, and she has admitted to lying repeatedly prior to and after her arrest, but Arias insists she is telling the truth now.

She has acknowledged that she dumped the gun in the desert, got rid of her bloody clothes, and even left the victim a voicemail on his cell phone within hours of killing him and dragging his body into the shower.

Arias' grandparents had reported a .25 caliber handgun stolen from their Northern California home about a week before the killing - the same caliber used to shoot Alexander - but Arias says she never knew her grandfather had the weapon. Authorities believe she brought it with her.
