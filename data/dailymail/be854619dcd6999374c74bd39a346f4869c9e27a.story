Alex Salmond was a leading member of a Republican faction that was expelled from the Scottish National Party in the 1980s.

The 79 Group – named after the year in which it was formed – wanted to set up a Scottish Socialist republic and spent several years fighting for more radical policies within the SNP. 

The removal of the Queen as Scotland’s head of state was one of its founding principles.

The First Minister was once part of a Republican faction called the 79 Group which called for the removal of the Queen as Scotland's head of state

The group even had links with Irish republican party Sinn Fein at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

Mr Salmond was one of its three spokesmen and took responsibility for publicity. He argued for greater militancy among workers, and advocated direct action including civil disobedience, according to his biographer, David Torrance.

But the group was eventually banned and its leading members – including Mr Salmond and Kenny MacAskill, now the Scottish justice minister, were expelled.

The group’s fervent Republicanism contrasts to Mr Salmond’s current support for the Queen. He has pledged to keep the monarchy if there is a Yes vote for Scottish independence.

Nine years after forming the 79 Group, Salmond attended the televised Chancellor's Budget at the House of Commons (pictured)

‘I think Her Majesty the Queen, who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign, will be proud to be Queen of Scots as indeed we have been proud to have her as the monarch,’ the SNP leader said this week. But earlier this year, Mr MacAskill suggested there could be a referendum on scrapping the monarchy if Scots vote Yes.

He said in March: ‘We will inherit the situation we have with the Queen as head of state in the ceremonial capacity that she has. But it will be for the people of Scotland to decide.

‘If and when that would occur, if they wished to have a referendum, and we would hope we would become the government post-2016, it will be for whoever is in office then.’

The 79 Group, which was formally known as the ‘Interim Committee of the 79 Group Socialist Society’, was formed after the 1979 referendum asking Scots whether they wanted their own Scottish Assembly with devolved powers.

Despite a narrow majority in favour of devolution, no parliament was set up at that time because there was not the minimum required turnout of 40 per cent. The Scottish parliament was eventually formed after another referendum in 1997.

The 79 Group had called on the SNP to target urban working-class voters as a radical alternative to Labour. At one meeting the group discussed a request from Sinn Fein for a speaker from the Irish Republican party to attend its annual conference. According to minutes of the meeting, Mr Salmond argued for rejecting the request.

Members of the 79 group were expelled from the SNP in 1982 but re-joined shortly afterwards. In 1985 Mr Salmond was elected to party office and began his rise up the SNP ranks to become its leader.

Mr Salmond has sought to brush off his involvement with the 79 Group, describing his involvement as the result of being a ‘brash young man’.
