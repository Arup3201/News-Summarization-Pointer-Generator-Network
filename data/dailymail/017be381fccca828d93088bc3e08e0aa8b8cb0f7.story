In a breathtaking orgy of flashes, bangs and perfectly-timed destruction, a two-mile viaduct is blown to smithereens in China.

Bomb experts spent weeks poring over blueprints of the Zhuan-yang viaduct in Wuhan, in Heibei province, in a bid to work out how to raze the structure to the ground without leaving even a single concrete slab still standing.

And as this amazing footage shows, their plans went by without a hitch, even breaking the record for the longest concrete bridge ever successfully demolished in China.

But the real hard work didn't begin until after the demolition when dozens of workers were sent into the rubble to clean up... armed with only high-vis jackets and brooms.

Scroll down for video.

Big bang: In a terrifying orgy of flashes, bangs and organised destruction, a 3.5-kilometre viaduct is blown to smithereens in China

Tough decisions: Bomb experts spent weeks poring over bluleprints of the Zhuan-yang viaduct in Wuhan, in Heibei province, in a bid to work out how to bring the structure to the ground without leaving even a concrete slab standing 

Built in 1997, the Zhuan-yang viaduct, which is located in southwest Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, used to be an important part of China's National Highway 318.

It runs from Shanghai to Tibet and is to be replaced by a 6-lane, 5.1-kilometer long viaduct as its design capacity is far below what needed.

It is the most difficult demolition ever undertaken in China for it is closely surrounded by residential buildings, and runs along 100,000-volt wires, over 30 underground pipelines including the main pipeline transmitting natural gas from west to east China.

'As the environment is very complicated, we have adopted very strict protective measures. For example, we put water bags along the viaduct to reduce the dust produced in the process of demolition,' said Xie Xianqi, president of Wuhan Demolition Engineering Company.

'The water mist produced in the blast can absorb the dust,'

Demolition workers also wrapped the piers with cotton, wires and sand bags to prevent flying debris.
