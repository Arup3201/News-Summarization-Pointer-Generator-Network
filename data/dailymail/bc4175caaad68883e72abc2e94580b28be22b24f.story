Warning: IMF Christine Lagarde said the global economy faced a 'defining moment' in the battle to avert a rerun of the Great Depression

The world must act now to prevent a ‘1930s moment’ and a ‘downward spiral’ into economic catastrophe, the International Monetary Fund warned last night.

IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the global economy faced a ‘defining moment’ in the battle to avert a rerun of the Great Depression.

She called for a ‘larger firewall’ to protect Italy and Spain from the debt storm raging in the eurozone.

In a speech in Berlin, the former French finance minister also urged Germany – the biggest economy in Europe – to take a lead in tackling the crisis and shoring up the single currency.

It came as European finance ministers met to try to thrash out a new deal to rescue Greece and stave off a debt default and the break-up of the euro.

Gikas Hardouvelis, an adviser to the Athens government, warned that the 17-nation bloc would collapse if Greece leaves the currency. ‘If Greece is left to go, then the market will ask who is next and the eurozone will dissolve,’ he said.

Brussels, meanwhile, appears to have abandoned plans for a 'Robin Hood Tax' on London.

Michel Barnier, European commissioner
for markets, admitted that a new levy on banks cannot be imposed on the
UK against its will. He denied being in a 'plot' against the City of 
London.

Today, the Washington-based IMF will take the axe to its forecasts for economic growth around the world and warn that Europe is heading for a double-dip recession.

Mrs Lagarde said: ‘We could easily slide into a 1930s moment, a moment where trust and cooperation break down and countries turn inward, a moment ultimately leading to a downward spiral that could engulf the entire world.’

She said 2011 was ‘a year in which so much of what could go wrong did go wrong’ – and laid the blame at the door of politicians in Europe and America.

At an an EU summit last month David Cameron used the UK¿s veto of a 'fiscal compact' when he could not secure safeguards for the City of London.

‘We saw many false starts and half measures in 2011 – in Europe, but also, for instance, in the United States,’ she said.

Mrs Lagarde added: ‘But what we must all understand is that this is a defining moment. It is not about saving one country or region. It is about saving the world from a downward economic spiral. The longer we wait, the worse it will get. The only solution is to move forward together. Our collective economic future depends on it.’

Mrs Lagarde said Europe must bolster its defences by increasing the size of its bailout fund. The IMF’s firepower must also be increased to $1trillion (£640billion) to help it fight the eurozone crisis.

But this will anger Britain, the U.S. and China, who have argued that the single currency area should do more to prop up the euro before turning to the IMF.
