Social networking has a reputation for cyber bullying and negativity, but a new app is hoping to change that.

Called Instapray, the free service lets people send prayers or words of encouragement - regardless of religious persuasion - to others who are having a difficult time.

This can be in the form of public posts, or in private groups with friends as well as strangers.

Instapray (pictured) was designed by San Francisco-based Fryderyk Ovcaric to be 'a safe, supportive online community' that is 'free of the overwhelming negativity present across much of the web.' Members of the Instapray community can post prayers and encouragement publicly or create private groups

Instapray was designed by San Francisco-based Fryderyk Ovcaric to be 'a safe, supportive online community' that is 'free of the overwhelming negativity present across much of the web.'

He said: 'As online bullying has increased in recent years, with the rise of anonymous sharing apps amplifying this destructive and hateful behavior, I believe the world can benefit from Instapray now more than ever.'

Reverend Dr Christopher Benek, an associate Pastor of Providence at the Presbyterian Church in Florida, believes religions may help artificial intelligence live alongside mankind.

'I don't see Christ's redemption limited to human beings,' he said in a recent interview.

'It's redemption to all of creation, even AI,' he added. 

'If AI is autonomous, then we have should encourage it to participate in Christ's redemptive purposes in the world.'

A ticker on the site shows that more than 33 million prayers have been posted using the app in 195 countries. 

This is the equivalent to 192 years of prayers. 

The name isn't restricted to religious people, it can be used by anyone with spiritual beliefs or people who want to discover and discuss world events. 

Members of the Instapray community can post prayers and encouragement publicly or create private groups. 

They can also join more broad-based groups that focus on global issues concerning peace in the Middle East, victims of natural disasters, or a cure for Ebola, for example. 

'Instapray is an uplifting community where people don't have to be afraid to express their faith or spirituality,' said Mr Ovcaric.

'They can be vulnerable, share personal struggles, or support others with a prayer, comment, or private message. 

'And if they choose to request prayer, a caring global community will reach out and respond with love and compassion.'

With this in mind the app comes with a set of guidelines including: 'Treat others as you would like to be treated,' 'Have meaningful and genuine interactions,' and 'Make the world a better place.'

People are forbidden from being rude and sharing prayers of illegal content.

The app is free and can be downloaded from the Apple App Store and Google Play.
