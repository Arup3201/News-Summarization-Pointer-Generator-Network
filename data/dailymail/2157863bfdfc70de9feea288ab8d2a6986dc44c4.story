Manchester United star Paul Scholes had his Â£30,000 car stolen after he left the engine running while defrosting it on his driveway.

The 38-year-old former England midfielder had gone back inside his home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, while ice melted on the windscreen of his Chevrolet Captiva LT 2 Estate.

But while he was inside thieves struck between 7.45am and 8am on Monday.

When he came back out of the house and discovered his car had gone he called 999.

Victim: Paul Scholes, pictured scoring for Manchester United against Wigan earlier this season, had his car stolen after leaving it running on his driveway on Monday morning

Greater Manchester Police confirmed that they are now investigating.

A spokesman for the force said: 'Police are investigating after a car was stolen while the owner was defrosting the vehicle.

'The grey Chevrolet Estate was stolen from the drive of a house in the Greenfield area of Oldham. Inquiries to locate the car are ongoing.'

The force also issued a warning to other motorists to beware opportunist thieves while defrosting their cars.

Chevrolet sponsor United and the the squad were offered a choice of firm's vehicles as part of the multi-million pound deal.

But manager Sir Alex Ferguson banned his young stars from owning the manufacturer's Corvette model which can hit top speeds of 195mph.

It is not the first time Scholes, who played for England 66 times scoring 14 goals before his retirement from international football in 2004, and his family have fallen victim to thieves.

In 2007 a gang of raiders armed with a knife stole Scholes's parents car after breaking into their home in Middleton, Greater Manchester.

After that incident, his dad Stewart said 'My wife went down to confront them. She screamed at me and I ran down to see them waving knives.

'They were shouting what they were going to do if I didn't give them the keys, so I just said "there's the keys, leave us alone".'

Scholes was said at the time to be 'disgusted' by the raid.
