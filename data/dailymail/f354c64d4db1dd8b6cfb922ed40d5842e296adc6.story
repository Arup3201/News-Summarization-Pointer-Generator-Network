Brides-to-be planning their weddings are usually most worried about one purchase in particular: the dress.

But while fretting over styles, cost and comfort, many don’t pause to think about what sort of gown their groom would choose.

A survey of British men showed their idea of the perfect wedding dress differed greatly from what women would choose.

Spot the difference: Men were asked to choose their ideal wedding dress for their wives and they'd opt for a meringue style while women go simple and pared-back

Brides magazine worked with designer Ian Stuart to create a man’s ideal gown for his bride, which turned out to be ivory, rather than white – the colour preferred by women.

Nearly half of men preferred an off-the-shoulder neckline, whereas women described their perfect dress as having capped sleeves.

Women wanted to walk down the aisle in dresses made of plain Chantilly lace whereas men liked the idea of their brides wearing satin on their wedding day.

The dress-shape favoured by 43 per cent of men was the princess design featuring a corset body with a full skirt.

Women, on the other hand, preferred a fish-tail design which is more tightly fitted down to the thighs with a more modest-sized skirt.

Diamante and crystals were deemed the best kind of dress detail and fresh flowers in the bride’s hair completed the perfect bridal look according to men. Women thought a tiara or headdress were the best accessories for tying the knot.

But the sexes did agreed on the perfect length of a gown; with the majority of both men and women opting for full-length dresses for the big day.

Mr Stuart’s vision of the perfect dress, as imagined by men, is a dropped waist princess silhouette shape with pleated skirt and a chapel train. The dress is made of taupe silk satin and has a fifties style draped off-the-shoulder portrait collar and a Swarovski Crystal encrusted belt.

Last year the dream dress as imagined by women was made a reality by Stephanie Allin, who has a bridal gown workshop in Wales.

Last year’s dress was a full-length fishtail-shape gown, with a full train and cathedral-length veil. The frock tailored to women’s tastes was comprised of a stiffened cotton canvas corset covered in Parisian lace, decorated with Swarovski crystals, glass bugle beads and sequins.

'The ingredients of the dress are text 
book fairytale, classic and beautiful. The men have come up with a 
timeless design that is the epitome of bridal fashion'

Brides magazine Editor, Jade Beer said: ‘With Brides readers having voted for the Nation’s Favourite Wedding Dress last year, we felt it was only right to ask for a man’s view this time. As the results came in, we were all predicting a body skimming fishtail silhouette that would show off curves like nothing else.

'How wrong we were! The shape he actually favoured over any other was a full length, off the shoulder princess gown in satin and heavily embellished with crystals.

'There is no doubt that men have good taste and have created a truly beautiful wedding dress – and we are thrilled and honoured that renowned British bridal designer Ian Stuart has brought this vision to life for us.’ 

The designer: Ian Stuart, who helped design the dresses, has created gowns for members of the royal family

Mr Stuart added: 'The ingredients of the dress are text book fairytale, classic and beautiful. The men have come up with a timeless design that is the epitome of bridal fashion.

'The cleverness of this dress is that it will suit all sizes and heights, which is not an easy thing to achieve in one design. It’s a clear sign that the grooms imagine their brides to wear a wedding dress, with a more traditional full skirt and romantic mood.’

Ian Stuart’s dress will be on display at Brides The Show, where one bride will win the dress, tailor-made by Mr Stuart. The show will be held from March 22 - 23 at Battersea Evolution, Battersea Park, London.
