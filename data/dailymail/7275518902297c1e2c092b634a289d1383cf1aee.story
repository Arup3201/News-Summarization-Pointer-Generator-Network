Got your juicer ready to start your liquid-only diet or are you set to starve yourself two days a week from January 1st?

If it's your New Year's resolution to lose weight and you plan to follow a fad diet in order to do it then you are doomed to fail, according to the author of a new book.

Ruth Field believes we would all be fitter and slimmer if instead of cutting carbs, gluten or dairy from our diets, we just cut the cr*p instead.

Planning a fast? Cut out sugary, high fat indulgences rather than all foods, says the author of a new book

The mother-of-two has written about her common sense approach to dieting in Cut The Cr*p: The No-Nonsense Plan For A Healthy Body And Mind that will be published by Sphere on 15 January.

Using her formidable alter-ago, The Grit Doctor, Ruth tells it how it is to give people a reality check on their waistlines.

She said the first step for anyone wanting to lose weight is to acknowledge they are fat because of their own lifestyle choices - not because of their genes, their job or their family.

The author of a new book has no patience for people who eat  chocolate and  complain about being overweight

She writes: 'Every time you are in a newsagents buying sweets or chocolate because you are starving and desperate for a sugar hit, remember this: someone else slimmer and fitter than you was feeling the same way, yet chose to eat an apple. And then went for a run. 

'That is the unpalatable truth that no one is telling you straight. You need to accept that you being overweight is no one's fault but your own.'

She adds: 'The reason you are fat is you eat too much cr*p and you don't move enough.' 

The author: Ruth Field has written Cut The Cr*p to help and inspire people to become healthier

Ruth writes that anyone who seeks salvation for their figure in a faddy diet is fooling themselves - because they won't be able to stick to it.

She uses the women she has observed in her local north London coffee shop as an example. 

'They discuss their fasting or no carb diets while munching on pastries and sipping lattes. 

'Educated interesting women spending their precious time and energy discussing diets while eating cr*p,' she writes.

Ruth believes that faddy diets and promises of miracle fixes are 'distracting us from the real issues'.

'The important stuff about food that actually matters: from food labelling to portion sizes, from sugar addiction to our insatiable appetite for processed foods - issues that demand our scrutiny so that we can make better foods choices for ourselves and our increasingly porky children.'

Thus in the book, Ruth does not promise miracles or a 'magical elixir juice recipe that is going to answer your prayers'.

Instead, she reveals how to make lifestyle choices that will last beyond January so you can become fitter and healthier for life.

She explains ways to stay motivated and provides recipes that are healthy but simple to make - and even your children will eat them. She knows as she tested them out on her own four-year-old twins.

Be accountable: Ruth said many people have to accept they are overweight because of the choices they have made instead of blaming other factors like their genes or job (posed by model)

She said people need to aim for healthier choices 'most of the time' (treating yourself occasionally is fine but bingeing on sugary food every day is not).

She said people need to be more educated about what is in the food they eat by becoming vigorous about checking labels for the nutritional content. In particular, caution should be taken when it comes to foods that claim to be healthy because they are low in fat or calories. A quick check of the label could reveal they are high in sugar and salt.

Ruth said to lose weight, people should think SAP.

S IS FOR SUGAR: Less of it

A IS FOR ACTIVITY: More of it 

P IS FOR PROCESSED GOODS: Fewer of these 

Ruth is also passionate about encouraging people to exercise more in order to stay fit and healthy. 

The 39-year-old former criminal barrister took up running herself in her mid-20s after agreeing to do a marathon. 

She knows from experience that it's not fun at the beginning because you are unfit but that doesn't mean you should quit. 

'Everyone hates it until they have practised it religiously for sometime,' she admitted.

She added: 'I wouldn't say I enjoy running but I enjoy the benefits that running brings such as getting outdoors and feeling healthier. I certainly didn't enjoy it when I first started. 

'I can honestly say I hated every single one of those early runs as they were incredibly difficult and I was out of breath within minutes feeling like I was on the verge of a heart attack.'

Everyone has the same 24 hours a day and if President Obama can find time to exercise, you can, says Ruth 

She also has a comeback for the other excuses people peddle for not being active, such as 'I don't have time' ('Everyone has the same 24 hours a day, President Obama finds the time and I guarantee he has more to get done in a given day than you do in an entire week').

And 'I don't have the right build for running' ('There's no such thing as the right build. It's an excuse often used by large breasted ladies but I once ran with a double E cup friend who wore two sports bras').

She's previously written the book Run Fat B!tch Run about what's she's learnt about running and how she got fitter.

Despite her initial dislike of the activity, she's now made it a part of her life and goes for a jog regularly. 

She's not currently training for a marathon but running has become a habit - this is what she encourages in her book. 

Find something that you can do regularly that keeps you active such as running, walking the children to school or going to a twice weekly Zumba class and it will do wonders for your long-term health.

Combined with eating less sugary foods and fewer processed goods, you will be slimmer - it's really that simple. 

Cut The Cr*p: The No-Nonsense Plan For A Healthy Body And Mind will be published by Sphere on 15 January, £12.99

Despite their best intentions, many people may take up running this New Year and give up by mid-January due to lack of motivation and support.

But Jantastic, a new running challenge kicking off on January 5, may be the secret to staying on track. 

This is an online challenge that's open to everyone of all abilities, with a range of goals. Participants set their own personal activity targets for their fitness, health or performance goals and strive to stick them during January, February and March. 

Runners can take part individually or as part of a team and every workout logged contributes towards a participant's overall Jantastic score.

Participants can also raise money for charity with Macmillan Cancer Support and Virgin Money Giving and also track their activity levels and routes with the sports social network, Strava.
