Prince Harry's endless optimism kept spirits high during the polar trek

Prince Harry has earned a few minutes of quiet reflection. And late last year, the fourth in line to the throne, whose life of royal and military duty rarely allows him a moment to himself, went to the ends of the earth to find them.

Before Christmas he spent five weeks with a team of servicemen and women who had lost limbs to Taliban bombs in Afghanistan, marching more than 200 miles across the harshest and most inhospitable landscape on the planet in temperatures of -50C to the South Pole.

Now the full story of this incredible trek is to be told in a two-part series starting next Sunday on ITV.

'This is one of the few places on earth that hasn't been screwed up by humans,' Harry muses. 'It's amazing, it's ridiculous that a place like this should exist. It's just nice to be out here with time to think about things, without being hassled. If you can't be free here, where can you be free?'

But, as the series reveals, it was Harry's indomitable sense of fun that proved most invaluable to the party. It shows how HRH might just stand for Harry's Raucous Humour, as he teases team guide Conrad Dickinson about his Northumberland accent, joking, 'Our team is going to have one extra, a translator – so everyone can understand what you're talking about.'

And his cheerful optimism in the face of horrendous weather kept spirits high. 'Minus 40... it's damn cold,' he smiles. 'This definitely wasn't the weather prediction.'

The cheerfully dark humour of Royal Artillery officer Major Kate Philp matches his. 'We had half as many legs as the average Antarctic trek: just one per team member. The objective,' she tells me, 'was getting to the South Pole, and then returning home in one piece – or at least as much of one piece as we were in when we started! And we didn't dare miss the last flight home before Christmas. There were a few wives and families, not to mention the Queen, who would not have been happy.'

Major Philp was the first British woman to lose a limb on active service, the victim of an IED (improvised explosive device) in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2008.

She was joined by ex-RAF Regiment Sergeant Duncan Slater, who lost both legs in an IED blast in 2009, and Captain Guy Disney and Captain Ibrar Ali, who also both lost limbs on Afghan duty.

Harry was worried that his fitness levels would let the team down

But the Prince started with a serious disadvantage – while the others had been training for the expedition for a year, he had not had that luxury. 'I'm a little bit anxious, nervous, all those things,' he admitted before they set out. 'I don't want to let the team down through fitness. There's a lot of pressure on everybody. My worries are that we'll push ourselves far too quickly. We'd never forgive ourselves if someone dropped out.

'It's about knowing exactly what you can and can't do. I'm terrified for myself, hugely daunted, so I can't imagine what it's going to be like for them. To take a double amputee to the Pole, it's going to be quite a moving moment when we get there. For me it's bigger than just these guys – we're trying to raise money but also trying to raise awareness that they're going to carry these injuries for the rest of their lives.'

Weather conditions were awful and freak storms the previous winter had piled the snow into mounds and troughs. Even the all-weather support vehicles struggled – and the team had to do it with artificial limbs.

'For me it's bigger than just these guys –
 we're trying to raise money but also trying to raise awareness that 
they're going to carry these injuries for the rest of their lives.'

For most of us it defies imagination. 'I knew it would be hard,' says Major Philp, 'but it was by far the hardest thing I've done. The physical exhaustion, and the mental challenge of looking at a white desert day after day – it takes its toll.'

'It wasn't easy,' says Sgt Slater, 'but the support we had made it possible. And a major part of that support came from Harry. He has a fantastic sense of humour, and he fitted right in. That's essential, because if the rest of us felt we didn't know how to speak to him, or if we were constantly worrying that he might find this or that remark offensive, it would burn up extra energy – energy you can't afford to lose. But we never thought, "We've got the fourth-in-line here, what are we supposed to be saying?" He wasn't like that, he was just brilliant.'

Major Philp agrees. 'He's a military man through and through, so with the shared military background it seemed a comfortable environment for him to be in. Harry got stuck in from the start: he made a great effort to get to know people, and he performed brilliantly on the trek. He was strong both physically and mentally, an incredibly valuable member of the team.'

For Sgt Slater, the expedition was the fulfilment of a promise he made to himself during the darkest days after his injury, to seek out the biggest test he could find. His aim was to send a message: don't write us off. 'People see amputees and assume we won't be as capable as able-bodied people,' he says. 'They don't mean it unkindly, but it's a big obstacle when wounded ex-servicemen are looking for jobs. So this was about showing what we could do.' His goal now is to take his message into schools and businesses as an inspirational speaker.

But the physical challenges are far from over. The team are training hard for this year's London marathon. And if Prince Harry should make a surprise last-minute decision to join them, he'll have his work cut out to keep up once more.
