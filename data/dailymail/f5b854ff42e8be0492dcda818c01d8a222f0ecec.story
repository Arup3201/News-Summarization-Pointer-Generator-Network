Atif Ali may never walk again after he was shot by a motorist in Luton in May

A trainee accountant may never walk again after he was shot by a motorist during a rush hour 'road rage attack'. 

Atif Ali, 27, got out of his silver Audi A3 to check for damage after a Ford Mondeo ran into the back of him. 

But as he went to speak to the Mondeo driver to swap details the motorist opened fire and Mr Ali was hit in the leg. The Mondeo then drove off.

Mr Ali was taken to hospital in a serious condition and has undergone extensive surgery to save his leg.

But doctors still do not know whether he still may be permanently disabled as a result of the shooting.

Today Mr Ali's family offered a £15,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the gunman who struck in Luton, Bedfordshire which has been in the grip of a gang war following 11 shootings this year.

The victim who studied at Nottingham University is highly respected in his community and regularly plays cricket.

He recently organised a charity dinner where he helped to raise more than £50,000 for good causes.

Mr Ali is not known to police and detectives are said to be baffled as to a motive for the shooting amid fears he was targeted by mistake.

The incident occurred at 8am on May 20 this year when Mr Ali left the home he shares with his elderly parents to go to work. 

Bedfordshire Police said his silver Audi was followed by a black Audi and the silver Mondeo registration number YM02 XYJ.

Mr Ali's car turned left at a road junction only for the Mondeo to plough into the rear end of the victim’s car as it followed. 

The shooting occurred as Mr Ali spoke to the Mondeo driver who was thought to have got out of his vehicle.

In a statement, Mr Ali's brother Amjid Ali said: 'Atif, my family and I are still waiting to find out why this happened to him. We are all at a loss as to the reason why.

'Atif is 27 years old, he is single and he works as a trainee accountant at a company in Hertfordshire. 'He lives with my elderly parents and has two brothers, including myself, and three sisters. We are a very close knit family.'

He added: 'Atif is highly thought of by everyone who knows him. He is a professional man who has never been in trouble with the police. He loves sport and likes to play cricket.

'Atif is a caring and loving person 
with a big heart, always putting others first. Atif has always been busy
with voluntary charity work.

He
recently organised a charity dinner where he helped to raise over 
£50,000 and was planning further events in the upcoming months.

'I
am here today, on behalf of my family, to talk about Atif and to make a
direct appeal to urge those people who may have information relating to
why Atif was shot, and also to those people who know who is 
responsible, to come forward and tell the police what they know.

'Since
this happened all our family and friends have been shocked and 
devastated. Atif and my family are indebted to those people who stopped 
to help Atif at the scene and they have our sincere thanks.

'Atif
remains in hospital where he has undergone extensive surgery to save 
his leg, but we cannot forget that he could have lost his life.

'He has been very brave but he will need to undergo more surgery. The long term effects of the injury are yet to be known but the doctors say that they will be life changing, which is a difficult thing to come to terms with, especially as Atif has always been an active, fit young man.

'He had all his life to look forward to and now he and my family will have to accept the possibility of his future as a disabled person. His life will change drastically as a consequence of what happened on May 20.

'Atif and my family are hardworking people and we have decided to offer a £15,000 reward which will be paid to anyone who comes forward with information that leads to a successful conviction of the person responsible for shooting my brother.

'I want to make it clear that we are not interested in making a judgement about anyone who comes forward to claim this money - we just want to know why this happened to my brother and who is responsible - we want these people to do the right thing - we want justice and we want to ensure this does not happen to someone else.'

Det Insp Iain Morgan of Bedfordshire Police said a man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and other related offences and has since been bailed.

Officers are trying to trace the driver of the Mondeo and the black Audi. A man with a tanned complexion, approximately 6ft tall with a dark grey beard and carrying a yellow JD sports bag was seen leaving the scene of the shooting.

Mr Morgan said: 'The motive for this shooting is unclear, Atif is not known to the police, he is a law abiding member of the community. We are a long way from solving this inquiry.'
