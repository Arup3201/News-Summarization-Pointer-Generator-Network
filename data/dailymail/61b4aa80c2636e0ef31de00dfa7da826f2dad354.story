Police are hunting a masked gang who raided a Birmingham swingers club - attacking a man and a woman and sending semi-naked customers fleeing into the street.

Three thugs targeted Tudor Lounge, based at the 400-year-old Stratford House in Highgate, just after 9.30pm on Wednesday, March 19.

One man, aged 53, was punched to the ground, while a woman was pushed during the raid at the timber-framed, Grade II listed property - built in 1601 in the reign of Elizabeth I.

The venue advertises itself as the leading and most exclusive 'swingers and fetish club in Birmingham

The raiders left the club empty handed but several customers were forced onto the street in their costumes

The gang fled empty-handed but the raid added to local concerns about the business, which has temporary planning permission as a private members' club from Birmingham City Council.

The raiders did not appear to be armed when they stormed the historic venue. 

One resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'Masked men ran into the club and we then saw lots of customers, half-naked or wrapped in towels, pouring out into the street.

'Residents feel the club is potentially attracting a criminal element to the area.

'It's not what people had in mind when they settled here.

'We feel the planning application for a private members' club was a very clever one in that those who even knew about it did not realise it would be a swingers' club.

'It seems to be busy most nights and Saturday night particularly so.

'Residents are now having problems parking their own cars, there have been some incidents of parking rows with visitors to the club.

'There's been some lewd behaviour in the area around the club, people coming out kissing and all over one another.

'There's been a lot of occasions where cars of men are cruising around.

'A lot of young girls live close by and parents are worried their children could be propositioned.

'There's also concern about property values going down.'

West Midlands Police confirmed they are investigating the raid where one man was punched in the head

A woman, not pictured here, was pushed to the ground but was fortunately uninjured by her shocking ordeal 

The club features several bedrooms and Jacuzzi-style baths which can be shared by several people

The Birmingham Mail revealed in January how Stratford House had been converted into the swingers club.

And earlier this month the council told the tenants to carry on swinging after concluding no planning breaches had taken place.

But the violent raid has renewed opposition to Tudor Lounge.

Locals are now planning a petition claiming they were not consulted properly about the club, which is sited near Calthorpe School grounds, a park and homes.

The resident added: 'We know this kind of club exists all over the country but think it should not be based in a residential area.

'It should be in or close to the city centre.

'The applicant's temporary planning application, granted by the council, also stated that he was allowed a maximum of 50 people in the club but there are times when there are more than 100 cars parked around the club, cars which don't belong to residents.'

Locals in Birmingham want the club, which has communal showers, to closed down 

Residents have been petitioning Birmingham City Council to strip the club of its operating licence

The club even features its own dungeon where people can tie each other up and enjoy unusual activities

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Police are investigating after masked raiders gained entry to a private function at the Tudor Lounge Club in Stratford Place, Highgate, at 9.35pm on March 18.

'Three men wearing ski masks were seen in the corridor.

'One man, aged 53, was punched in the head, resulting in him falling to the floor.

'He was treated for a cut to his nose and bump to his head. Another woman was pushed, but not injured.

'No weapons were seen. The men then left the building. Nothing was reported stolen.

'Police inquiries are on-going into the incident. No arrests have been made at this stage.'

The Mail previously told how the timber-framed property - an ancient monument - had been transformed into a club for swingers and fetish fans, complete with a dungeon.

The building was officially advertised online under the name Tudor Lounge after its current tenants signed a ten-year lease with property owner, Benjamin Jackson, last March.

The city council granted temporary change of use planning permission for 'the private members meeting venue' last year and had claimed no complaints had been raised at the time.

Earlier this month a city council spokesman said: 'Officers visited the Tudor Lounge on January 29, 2015 to establish whether any licensable activities took place at this venue.

'They found its bar operates on a 'bring your own drinks' basis - the drinks featured in photos of the bar area were actually coloured water and cooking oil.

'Also the club appears to be set up for participation, rather than the presentation of any performance for an audience which might require an entertainment licence.

'At present there is no justification for revisiting the premises, but if officers receive new intelligence regarding activities at this venue this position may be reviewed.'

The Tudor Lounge website, featuring pictures of scantily-clad women, has boasted of being the UK's most exclusive swingers venue.

'The building has been fully refurbished with only one thing in mind - your pleasure and enjoyment,' it said.

When previously asked about complaints about the property's current use, a spokesman for the club said: 'People should mind their own business.

'We are consenting adults.'
