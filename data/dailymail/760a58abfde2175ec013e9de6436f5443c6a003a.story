As apartment construction continues to boom across the east coast of Australia, the suburbs that are getting the most attention from buyers have finally been revealed.

Victoria landed five spots in the top 10 most searched suburbs for off-the-plan apartments in the country, according to the latest research from realestate.com.au.

Only 3km from Melbourne's CBD, it's no surprise that Collingwood took the top spot as the most viewed suburb for brand new and unbuilt units.

It was followed by the waterfront suburb of Hampton, but third and fourth place went to the wealthy coastal New South Wales suburbs of Lane Cove and Mosman.

Almost 50 per cent of the exclusive residential Sydney suburbs' properties are apartments and units, with Lane Cove offering harbour views to home owners in the right location.

Melbourne's CBD scooped up fifth place, while the last two spots went to Carlton and Richmond.

Aside from the location's close proximity to the CBD, off-the-plan homes are understood to be particularly popular in Victoria due to the stamp duty savings they present.

'When you buy an off-the-plan apartment in Victoria, you get stamp duty savings that are more significant than other states. For example, purchasing an off-the-plan apartment for $500,000 can save you up to $25,000,' Evan Cathcart from 360 Property Group said.

'There are parts of Collingwood that are only one km or a 10 minute walk from the CBD. From my experience, most people buying off-the-plan in Collingwood are predominantly young professionals. 

'With Collingwood, they're close to their white-collar jobs in the city and have bustling cafes, bars and restaurants at their doorstep.

This apartment block's website states: 'Construction for Bay Pavilions is well underway, so buy now and possibly move in at the end of the year!'

It also offers apartments for between $615,000 and $1,045,500 

'When we sold our first projects three to four years ago Collingwood was quite grungy and now it's more gentrified.'

Unexpectedly, the inner-western suburb of Rhodes and Wollongong, an hour and a half from Sydney, were in the top 10 most searched suburbs.

Brisbane, at 6th place, confirmed that the demand for central locations was an overriding factor in the demand for off-market apartments.
