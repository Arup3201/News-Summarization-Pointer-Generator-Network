This is the first picture of the talented 13-year-old dancer killed in a horrific crash after a police car was involved in a high-speed pursuit of another vehicle.

Wiktoria Was died in the crash on Sunday evening in New Cross, south-east London, while travelling with her parents and brother.

Children at Goffs School in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, where Wiktoria was a Year 9 pupil, were today told about the tragedy.

It came as the man accused of causing her death appeared in court today to face a number of charges.

Alison Garner, headteacher of Goffs 
School, wrote a personal message to students in Wiktoria's form group, saying: 'The school counsellor will be available at least 
this week for students and staff. Wiktoria was a highly-valued member of
our community.'

The head also said the 'charming' and 'bubbly' student would be 'much missed by 
us all'. She was also described as a 'talented dancer'.

Many pupils at the school appeared close to tears as they went home this evening after learning of the loss of their classmate.

The teenager was a back seat 
passenger in her family's VW Polo when it was hit by a Peugeot 308 which
was being pursued by a marked police patrol car.

She was travelling with her mother, father and 
four-year-old brother.

Her father, in his 40s, suffered chest and abdominal injuries, and is being treated at King's College Hospital, south London.

Injuries: The girl's mother, father and brother were also injured in the crash that is now being investigated by the Directorate of Professional Standard

Her
mother, in her 30s, and her four-year-old brother, both sustained chest
injuries but were discharged from hospital yesterday.

Devon Newell, 32, of Peckham, was 
charged with causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury 
by dangerous driving, failing to stop for police, failing to stop at the
scene and driving with no insurance and licence.

He appeared by videolink at Camberwell Green Magistratesâ€™ Court today.

Shaven-headed Newell, 32, from Peckham, south east London, appeared before the court wearing a black-and-white striped polo shirt.

No plea was entered and Newell was remanded in custody to appear before Woolwich Court Court on January 15.

He spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth, asked for 
his address not to be read out to the court because he lives with his 
elderly mother.

He wore a black and white striped polo shirt with a red collar and sat with his arms folded throughout the five minute hearing.

The Yard said the pursuing police car had its blue lights and siren on when the collision happened.

Traffic police and officers from the Directorate of Professional Standards are investigating, the force said.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has also been informed.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place on the girl today. An inquest will open and adjourn in due course.
