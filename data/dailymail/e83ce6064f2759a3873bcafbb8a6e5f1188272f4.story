This brave young family will be doing their best to celebrate this Christmas after receiving the devastating news their mother is terminally ill with cancer.

Kerry Briggs was first diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer three years ago when she discovered a lump as she breastfed her seven-month-old daughter.

The 35-year-old, who lives at Sheidow Park in Adelaide, had a double mastectomy and underwent 12 months of gruelling chemotherapy, radiotherapy and intravenous therapy to successfully rid her body of cancer.

But two years on from her last chemotherapy treatment, Mrs Briggs was informed the cancer she thought was gone had now spread to her pelvis, spine, ribs and liver.  

Mrs Briggs, her husband David and children Lachlan, 7, and Caitlin, 3, were told the heartbreaking news on November 26 that she was losing her battle.

'It still hasn't sunk in, none of us are coping. We've only got a limited amount of time and we don't know how long,' Mr Briggs told Daily Mail Australia.

'My son's a mess because he remembers the chemo from last time. They both know the cancer has come back, but they don't know the full problem of where it's heading.'

Doctors have given Mrs Briggs a 50 percent chance of surviving the next four to five years, which means  she might not get the chance to see her children finish primary school.

But Mrs Briggs' family refuse to give up hope and they are taking every measure to ensure she stays as healthy as possible. 

Her husband says it will all depend on Mrs Briggs' liver function and how she responds to chemotherapy and the various other drugs she will be taking for the rest of her life.

'The aim for us now is to make some lasting memories that the kids will remember,' he said. 

'Family holidays (like Christmas and birthdays) will be very precious over the next few years... but they can also be the most difficult times.'

Friends and relatives of the Briggs family have rallied together since the diagnosis to fundraise to help pay for treatment and holidays for the young family

Friends and relatives of the Briggs family have rallied together since the diagnosis last month and so far raised more than $20,000 through the crowd funding website mycause. 

They have also planned several fundraising events to help the family create the lasting memories and help give Mrs Briggs a fighting chance.

'I'm trying to work as much as I can to lessen the burden... we've been struggling for three years. We're young, we've still got a massive mortgage,' Mr Briggs said.

'My wife wants to have a white Christmas next year (in America) - that's on her bucket list. We're also hoping to get away on some other family holidays next year.

'There's also potential future chemotherapy treatments that aren't covered by the PBS that we're looking at... this all adds up.' 

Mrs Briggs has already started working on making quilts, video recordings, journals and memory books for her children.
