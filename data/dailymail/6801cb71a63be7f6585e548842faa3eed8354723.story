You wouldn’t need a big restaurant to organise a lunch for the England teams who have beaten the All Blacks in New Zealand.

It has happened just twice — in 1973 and 2003 — but Stuart Lancaster’s side can join those guys on the top table if they play their cards correctly this week. They were very good in Auckland but in Dunedin they must play like world-beaters.

This is by a long chalk the biggest week yet for England under Lancaster. He has a large squad of hungry, in-form players to select from — and that is a situation that needs to be managed — but this is the moment to go ruthlessly for a result that would firstly define their own careers and then reverberate around the globe. They mustn’t let this moment pass them by.

Proud: England's players fought valiantly but were defeated by New Zealand in Auckland

Close: England skipper Chris Robshaw looks dejected after his team's narrow defeat

This
 is when that proud England rugby culture and team ethic which Lancaster
 has worked hard to re-establish must come into its own. Some players 
who excelled at Eden Park will need to be dropped — sport can be harsh —
 but they also need to be valued for their contribution.

Meanwhile,
 those who were resting in the stands must immediately honour that 
performance by their colleagues in Auckland with something very special 
of their own. It’s a fascinating dynamic and very rarely seen in New 
Zealand, where an All Blacks win in the first Test normally means the 
series is dead and buried.

New
 Zealand are masterly at post-match analysis and ‘working out’ the 
opposition but this time  England can set them entirely fresh problems 
and challenges.

Decisions: England coach Stuart Lancaster will have some selection choices to make in Dunedin

Physical: England went toe to toe with New Zealand on their own back yard in Auckland

Assuming no 
injuries, I would bring Danny Care and Owen Farrell in at half-back, 
pair Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell  at centre and move Manu 
Tuilagi to the left wing. Up front, despite a very fine performance by 
Geoff Parling, Courtney Lawes has to play in the second row and I would 
bring Tom Wood and Billy Vunipola into the back row.

New
 Zealand won’t concede so many penalties as they did on Saturday so 
England will need to score two or three tries to win. They need the 
firepower the incomers can provide and conditions will be perfect at the
 indoor Forsyth Bar Stadium and that has to be the focus in training 
this week.

This scenario 
reminds me a lot of the England tour to South Africa in 2000. The team 
was developing nicely after the disappointment of the 1999 World Cup 
when we lost to New Zeland and South Africa, but we badly needed a 
landmark win ‘on the road’ against one of the giants to bolster the 
squad’s self-belief and rock the rugby world.

Heartbreak: England must bounce back from their loss and keep the series alive with victory in Dunedin

Victories
 on their patch count double. We nearly got it in Pretoria, in fact we 
should have won at Loftus Versveld and I will go to my grave thinking 
that Tim Stimpson should have been awarded a penalty try when he was 
taken out trying to dob down his own kick ahead. The TMO decided 
otherwise and we finished up losing by five points, the same margin as 
Saturday.   

I remember 
vividly Lawence Dallaglio coming off the field that night and being both
 very angry and positive. ‘We have to stop playing well and coming 
second, it’s about winning these games,’  Lawrence snarled at the TV 
cameras.

Equally I was very 
impressed and heartened to hear Chris Robshaw straight after Saturday’s 
game talking about winning the series 2-1. There were no platitudes 
about a great performance in defeat and a makeshift team playing bravely
 and well — which they did — just an immediate grasping of the fantastic
 opportunity ahead. 

Knock-out blow: All Blacks centre Conrad Smith scored the decisive try with two minutes left to play

Time to shine: If England play their cards right, they can join a small group to have won in England

Back 
in 2000 we headed off to the rugby heartland of Bloemfontein and in 
terms of rugby fanaticism and atmosphere, Dunedin won’t be far different
 this week. Hardcore.

We 
were expected to make up the numbers. Pretoria was our shot at glory but
 we absolutely believed and the result was a dominating performance and a
 27-22 win that took everybody by surprise and set us on our way.  

Bloemfontein
 was a huge momentum changer in that team’s evolution. After that we 
didn’t lose to a Southern Hemisphere team for four years — 14 straight 
Tests — and England now have a golden chance to do something similar.
