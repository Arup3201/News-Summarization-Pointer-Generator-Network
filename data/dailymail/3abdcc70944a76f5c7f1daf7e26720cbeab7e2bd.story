Boris Johnson has been pictured caught up in a dramatic mid-air scuffle as he tried to help calm an abusive passenger who had to be restrained while on a flight from Kuala Lumpur.

The Mayor of London joined efforts to restrain the man while flying at 35,000 feet. The man was described as 'off his head' by one of Mr Johnson's delegation.

Technology ambassador Eileen Burbidge yesterday tweeted a picture showing five members of the crew tackling the man: 'so impressed w/MH2 cabin crew (Kuala Lumpur-LHR); amazing professionalism/handling of passenger who was off his head.'

Today, images have emerged of Mr Johnson in the thick of a joint effort to reason with the man.

A spokesman for the Mayor told the MailOnline: 'The Mayor along with a number of other passengers and members of the cabin crew did make several attempts to calm the gentleman concerned but to no avail.

'We understand the gentleman was restrained by the crew and detained by police on arrival at Heathrow.'

The drama unfolded as Mr Johnson travelled on the 13 hour Malaysia Air flight home from his Far East tour.

The man - who was believed to be English - was said to be singing loudly, before becoming abusive.

Mr Johnson sat with him and urged him to remain calm.

But after a short time he eventually became aggressive again, onlookers said. 

Cabin crew on board the Malaysia Airlines flight later restrained the man after Mr Johnson's pleas for him to calm down were ignored.

A Met spokesman said police were called at around 5.40am to reports of a disruptive passenger on a flight to Heathrow Airport.

The 43-year-old passenger was met by officers at 6am once the plane landed at Heathrow, and was arrested on suspicion of being drunk aboard an aircraft and common assault involving a member of the cabin crew.

The man was in custody this morning at a west London police station.
