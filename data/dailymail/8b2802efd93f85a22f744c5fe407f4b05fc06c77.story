A 'dark' storyline in soap Emmerdale has attracted dozens of complaints just weeks after a similar plot took place in EastEnders.

Last night's Emmerdale featured a scene in which Natalie Anderson's character Alicia Metcalfe was sexually assaulted by teenager Lachlan White, played by Thomas Atkinson.

The soap, which was aired at the earlier time of 6.45pm because of Europa football matches, came with warning of 'distressing scenes' before it was shown, but still angered some viewers.

An Ofcom spokesman said: 'Ofcom has received 47 complaints regarding Emmerdale on ITV yesterday. We are assessing these before deciding whether to investigate or not.'

A spokeswoman for the ITV soap said: 'Lachlan is a very troubled teenager and his assault upon Alicia is the beginning of a very dark storyline for his character. We thoroughly researched this aspect of the plot and the drama was intentionally implicit rather than explicit.'

Viewers were told before the episode was broadcast that it included 'distressing' scenes 'that some viewers may find difficult to watch'.

The episode, which had to be brought forward to the earlier time of 6.45pm, did feature warnings of 'distressing scenes' before it aired, but still drew anger from some viewers

Only last month, Ofcom cleared the BBC of breaching broadcasting rules with a controversial rape storyline in EastEnders which prompted a number of complaints.

More than 90 people wrote to Ofcom to voice concerns about the incident, screened in October, in which Queen Vic landlady Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) was attacked by Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo).

But Ofcom cleared the edition of the BBC1 soap as result of warnings given to viewers and its avoidance of graphic content.
