Shedding weight is as good as gold under an unusual slim-down initiative in Dubai over growing concerns about rising obesity levels in the wealthy Gulf city-state.

Municipal officials are offering a gram of gold - worth about £30 at current prices - for each kilogram of weight lost in a 30-day challenge.

The minimum drop is two kilograms, or 4.4 pounds, to cash in - and there is no upper limit to how much you can earn.

Local media Wednesday quotes Dubai official Hussain Lootah as saying there is no limit on the payout for the golden losers, who must sign up and weigh in by Friday.

While many big businesses offer incentives for quitting smoking and leading an active lifestyle, dishing out pure gold for shedding the pounds is a new level altogether.

World Health Organisation figures from 2009 revealed the extent of the UAE's obesity epidemic with some 39.9 per cent of women in the Emirates being severely overweight.

The Dubai challenge runs until 16 August, and three campaign-winning losers who enter a lucky draw will receive a gold coin each worth £3,500. Other golden slimmers will share gold coins worth a total £3,500.

The plan is the latest attempt to encourage healthier lifestyles in the United Arab Emirates. Across the Gulf Arab states, authorities have raised alarms about rising obesity from increasing fast-food diets and lack of exercise.
