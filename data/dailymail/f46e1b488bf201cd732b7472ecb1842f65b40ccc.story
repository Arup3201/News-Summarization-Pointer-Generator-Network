You may think that appearing intelligent might be the key to getting a promotion at work.

But people who want to rise to the top should concentrate on looking healthy, according to a new study.

Researchers found that 70 per cent of the time, a worker with a healthy complexion is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent.

They came to their conclusion after conducting an experiment where participants chose from different faces (shown) to pick the leader of a fictional company

They discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘optional extra’ for workers looking for a pay rise or for politicians seeking election.

In an experiment by VU University Amsterdam, 148 candidates were asked to select a future leader of a fictional firm by choosing between two digitally manipulated photographs of the same man.

One image was altered to make him look healthier and the other manipulated to make him look cleverer.

The experiment revealed that seven times out of 10, the man with the healthy complexion was more appealing than the intelligent looking male.

‘Here we show that it always pays for aspiring leaders to look healthy, which explains why politicians and executives often put great effort, time, and money in their appearance,’ said Assistant Professor Brian Spisak from the Department of Management and Organisation at the university. 

The experts discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘optional extra’ for workers looking for a raise (illustrated with a stock image) or for politicians looking to get elected. However, people are more likely to vote for a healthy-looking politician and choose a healthy-looking boss

Office plants help workers be more creative and productive, which could result in promotion, a University of Exeter study claims.

At work, humble houseplants have been proven to aid concentration, increase productivity and boost staff wellbeing by 47 per cent, according to a study undertaken in December last year.

The results showed that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent.

Plants have previously been proven to have positive effects in hospitals, where patients with potted plants close by said they experienced less pain, anxiety and tiredness, while houses with plant-filled rooms contain between 50 and 60 per cent fewer bacteria than other rooms without plants.

‘If you want to be chosen for a leadership position, looking intelligent is an optional extra under context-specific situations whereas the appearance of health appears to be important in a more context-general way across a variety of situations.’

In the experiment, the participants were given a job description that specified the CEO’s main challenge each time they were asked to choose between the two images.

Job descriptions involved driving aggressive competition, renegotiating a key partnership with another company, leading the company’s shift into a new market and overseeing the sustained exploitation of non-renewable energy.

The participants chose more healthy-looking faces over less healthy-looking faces in 69 per cent of trials and this preference was equally strong irrespective of the future CEO’s main challenge, according to the study published in the access journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.

More intelligent-looking faces were only preferred over less intelligent-looking faces for the two challenges that would require the most diplomacy and inventiveness: renegotiating the partnership and exploring the new market.

The aim of the experiment was to explore people’s implicit preferences for traits of leaders, such as health, intelligence, and attractiveness.

The researchers focused on facial traits because these provide a wealth of information about individuals.

In women as well as men, caring and cooperative personalities are statistically more likely to have a more ‘feminine’ face, due to higher oestrogen levels, while aggressive risk-takers tend to have higher testosterone levels and a more ‘masculine’ face.
