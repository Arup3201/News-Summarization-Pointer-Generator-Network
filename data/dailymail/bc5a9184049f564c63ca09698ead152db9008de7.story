Al Qaeda has released a professionally produced propaganda video blaming U.S. President Barack Obama for the recent deaths of an American and South African hostage in Yemen.

The video clip features Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi, a top commander for Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, accusing Obama of recklessness and warning the United States against attempting to carry out rescue raids on hostages in future.

Al-Ansi's comments mark the first time Al Qaeda has made a public statement since British-born U.S national Luke Somers and South African Pierre Korkie were killed when U.S. special forces attacked an Al Qaeda safe house in a failed attempt to rescue the two men last week.

The six-minute video - released by the terror group's in-house Al-Malahem media centre - appears to have been shot using an expensive HD camera in the style of the professionally produced and edited films put out by Al Qaeda's Islamic State enemies in Syria and Iraq.

Shared on the terror group's social media websites, the slick effort marks a significant step up in professionalism from the grainy films previously released by Al Qaeda and its affiliates.

Speaking in front of a black screen with the chilling sight of the terror group's flag hanging behind him, al-Ansi said he warned the U.S. against attempting to rescue the hostages after a first  operation to do so failed last month.

The terror commander accused Obama of recklessness, and said the raid 'caused things to go in a completely different way than we wanted.'

Obama previously said he ordered the raid because Somers, a 33-year-old journalist, was believed to be in 'imminent danger.' The president condemned Somers' killing as a 'barbaric murder.'

U.S. officials said that about 40 American special forces were involved in the rescue attempt, which followed U.S. drone strikes in the area.

The rescuers, backed by Yemeni ground forces, advanced within 100 meters of the compound in Shabwa province when they were spotted by the militants. 

A firefight ensued, and the raid was over in about 30 minutes, they said.

Hard decision: Barack Obama previously said he ordered the raid because Somers, a 33-year-old journalist (pictured in a recent Al Qaeda propaganda video), was believed to be in 'imminent danger' 

Al-Ansi described the rescue operation as an 'execution order' and that poorly equipped militants fended off heavily armed US forces for nearly three hours.

Initial Al Qaeda demands were never clear, but al-Ansi said the terror group wanted to negotiate the release of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay.

He also mentioned Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, known as the 'Blind Sheik', who is serving a life sentence in the United States on a terrorism conviction.

'They could have at least negotiated with us about some clauses or show sincerity,' he added.

Best laid plans: Navy SEALs made it to within 100 yards of Mr Somers and fellow captive Pierre Korkie but they were executed by their captors before the team could reach them

Al-Ansi also warned that Al Qaeda would continue to 'put the lives of all Americans in danger inside and outside of America ... in the air, on the ground and in the sea.'

Washington considers Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror group founded by Osama bin Laden. The group has been linked to several sophisticated plots to attack the U.S. homeland that were either botched or foiled.

With the permission of Yemen's government, the U.S. has for years launched drone strikes against militant targets in the country and provided Yemen with hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance. Civilian casualties from the drone strikes have stoked anger.

Hours before the release of the video, the group said that it shelled a Yemeni air base used by U.S. forces. It was not immediately clear if there were casualties.

Al Qaeda has issued a veiled warning to ISIS propaganda chiefs by attacking sickening beheading videos as damaging to the international image of Islamic terrorism.

In a 43-minute long filmed statement released earlier this week, senior Al Qaeda commander Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi said the terror group would no longer be beheading captives - adding that in future hostage executions would be carried out 'with a bullet'.

Although he did not name ISIS, al-Ansi's message - which he said made on behalf of Al Qaeda as a global organisation, not just his  Arab Peninsula branch - was clearly aimed at the terror group led by self-appointed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 

'No doubt, some of our brothers were affected by seeing scenes of beheadings that were spread recently. We do not accept and we strongly reject them,' he said in a clear reference to ISIS' brutal filmed murders of Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, and 22 Syrian soldiers by the group's executioner in chief, Jihadi John.

'Recording such acts, and spreading them among the people in the name of religion and jihad, we see as a big mistake. It is not acceptable, no matter the justification,' al-Ansi added.
