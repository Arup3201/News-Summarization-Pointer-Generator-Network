It's Breaking 'bout time that the immensely popular AMC show added some Golden Globes to its roster of awards and on Sunday night, it did just that.

The slow-burning cult classic bowed out in September with a critically acclaimed finale that was also a resounding hit with the show's diehead fans.

It saw Bryan Cranston's meth-cooking antihero Walter White enjoy a redemption of sorts just before he died and involved a typically mesmeric performance from the 57-year-old.

Well deserved: Breaking Bad scooped Best TV Drama and Bryan Cranston walked away with Best Actor for his epoch-making turn as Walter White

So it's fitting that the talent that powered the transformation from Walter's meek school science teacher incarnation to terrifying overlord 'I am the danger' Heisenberg era was recognised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association at the 71st Golden Globes.

Sadly, his partner-in-crime, the incandescent Aaron Paul, 34, lost out in the supporting actor to category to Jon Voight for Ray Donovan, but he got the chance to yell his catchphrase when the show bagged the Best Drama honour.

'Yeah, B****!,' Paul yelled after the ensemble cast took to the stage to accept their award with show creator, Vince Gilligan.

Recognition: Vince Gilligan finally got the recognition he deserves with this award

The winning team: Cranston, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt, Gilligan, R.J Mitte and Aaron Paul celebrate their achievement

Cranston took to the stage to thank Gilligan, who was a writer on the cult X Files, who helmed the show throughout its five seasons.

'He's a genius,' he told the audience before shouting out to Paul: 'I love you, man... you're a great actor!'

He also thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and revealed he hoped a win at the Globes would help international audiences find the show.

And it might not be the last time we've seen Paul's excitable but pure-hearted Jesse Pinkman, or strangely, Cranston's Walter.

At last: Cranston accepted Best Actor for his incredible portrayal of Walter White in AMC's sleeper hit

Transformation: Cranston's performance as the meek chemistry teacher who becomes a drug kingpin was as breathtaking as Paul's was heartfelt

Slow burner: The show finished after its fifth season in October and was by that point a huge hit for the network

In the February issue of Details, Paul reveals he and co-star Cranston want to make cameos in the upcoming spin-off, Better Call Saul.

With production on the spin-off scheduled to start later this year, the actor, whose character was last seen driving off into the sunset in the series finale, is eager to get back into those meth covered shoes.

'Both Bryan and I want to be a part of that, if they'll have us.'

Television favourites: RJ Mitte, Bryan, Anna, Betsy Brandt and Vince posed together with the awards

Mr and Mrs: Cranston and Gunn enjoyed a moment at the AMC afterparty

But the Emmy winner does admit when the series was winding down he couldn't resist giving input and sent a letter to producers with suggestions of how he thought his character should die in the finale.

'I just felt like I would always regret it if I didn't at least throw them a pitch on how I wanted Jesse to go out. So I gave a few different ideas of how I thought he would kill himself. I didn't want anybody else taking his life.'

While he says 'the letter was awful,' producers, thankfully, didn't take the advice and spared Jesse's life in the end.

The gang's all here: RJ Mitte, Cranston, Gunn, Gilligan and Brandt pose with their statues

'I wish that I was Jesse's Girl!' Paul, with wife Lauren Parsekian in the background, got the party started as usual

Exciting times: Brandt, who played Walt's kleptomaniac purple loving sister-in-law thew herself into the celebrations

Interestingly, Jesse was supposed to be killed off in the first season but quickly became a fan favourite.

Aaron was nominated for five Emmys for playing Jesse and won two during Breaking Bad's five year run.

Back in September, the series finale attracted an all-time high of 10.3 million viewers.

Step aside, Lady Macbeth! Robin Wright celebrated her win for Best Actress in a Television Series for House of Cards

Coming into her own: Elisabeth Moss's gritty performance in Top of the Lake won her Best Actress

Compelling: Moss in Top of the Lake and Wright in House of Cards

She did it! Robin gave the thumbs up as she rushed to the press room

Luckily, Gilligan has said he wants to bring both actors back for cameos on Breaking Bad Saul, which stars Bob Odenkirk as sketchy lawyer Saul Goodman.

This is great news for Aaron who says he never interferes with what the writers and producers of the show do.

'I never give my two cents when it comes to Breaking Bad, because why would I?' he says. 'I'm just the actor, and what they're doing is perfect, you know?'

Elisabeth Moss, 31, was probably similarly respectful on the set of her latest drama, the Sundance Channel's Top of the Lake, which is written by The Piano auteur Jane Campion.

Hitting the ground running: Former SNL star Andy Samberg's Brooklyn Nine-Nine won Best Comedy and Best Actor for him

Eye candy: The Brooklyn Nine-Nine cast - Chelsea Peretti, Melissa Fumero and Stephanie Beatriz - are a comely bunch

Brand new hit: Samberg plays a police cub trying to cut it on the 99th precinct with his chief, played Andre Braugher

Rising star: Andy can add a Golden Globe to his impressive resume

Her diligence in the role of police officer Robin Griffin, who is investigating the disappearance of a pregnant 12-year-old, won her the Best Actress in a Mini-Series of Motion Picture TV award.

Visibly shaken, the star - best known for her portrayal of Peggy Olsen in AMC's Mad Men, accidentally swore as she accepted her award.

Newly engaged Robin Wright, 47, managed to keep her speech clean but was obviously moved as she was ushered to the stage to accept Best Actress in TV Drama.

Wright shines as the Lady Macbeth to Kevin Spacey's Machiavellian US representative in the original Netflix series.

No surprises: Michael Douglas won Best Actor for his acclaimed portrayal of Liberace in Behind the Candelabra

Showing the love: Douglas heaped praise on his co-star Matt Damon, and the pair enjoyed an embrace at the HBO party

Critically acclaimed: Douglas and Damon were a revelation in Behind the Candelabra

Big win: Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub won a Golden Globe for Behind The Candelabra

Saturday Night Live alum Andy Samberg, 35, hit the ground running with his new comedy, Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

The show picked up the Best Comedy or Musical award and Samberg himself was named Best Actor in the same category.

As predicted, Steven Soderbergh's Behind the Candelabra was named Best in the Mini Series or Motion Picture category and its leading man, Michael Douglas, claimed Best Actor.

The 69-year-old, who played Liberace in the biopic, heaped lavish praise on his co-star Matt Damon, 43, for his portrayal of the musician's lover, Scott Thorson.

She gets a go! Presenter Amy Poehler won for her turn in Parks and Recreation

Helping hand: Poehler got a backrub from Bono before collecting her award

Funny lady: The immensely popular Poehler was overjoyed to be recognised for her work on this hit show

'The only reason he's not standing up here is I had more sequins,' Douglas generously quipped.

Angelina Jolie's father Jon Voight, 75, upset the Breaking Bad clean sweep by pipping Paul to the Best Supporting Actor honour for Showtime's Ray Donovan.

And the show's co-host, Amy Poehler, 42, got to see proceedings from the other side as she accepted Best Actress for Parks and Recreation in the Comedy of Musical section.

'What did she say?' Jacqueline Bisset's speech was a disaster but her performance in Dancing in the Edge was anything but

Jolie good: Angelina's father Jon Voight was a surprise win for Ray Donovan

Noted: Jon Voight in Ray Donovan and Bisset starring in Dancing on the Edge

Best Supporting Actress in Mini-Series of TV Motion Picture went to Jacqueline Bisset, 69, who funnily enough, could have done with some herself.

She won for Dancing on the Edge, and given her rambling acceptance speech, may have just fallen off.
