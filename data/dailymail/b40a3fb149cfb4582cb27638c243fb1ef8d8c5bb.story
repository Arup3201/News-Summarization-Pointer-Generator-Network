A man has been served a $115 ticket for spitting on a Minneapolis sidewalk.

Myles Thomas, who said he has been getting over a cold, was walking to the University of Minnesota campus to grab some pizza on Monday night and spat on the ground - just as a patrol car passed.

He was stunned when he saw the car make a U-turn and approach him and his friends.

'The police officers... informed me that spitting on the sidewalk or any public property was subject for a citation,' Thomas, 21, wrote on his Facebook page following the incident.

'Shocked, I questioned them about it, as this was something I had never 
even heard of.'

Shocked: Myles Thomas, 21, has been fined $115 after police saw him spitting on the sidewalk in Minneapolis

He apologized for spitting but, claiming that he had been 'a little under the weather', he spat into the snow again - and the officers weren't happy about it.

'He and his partner got out of 
the car and approached me and told me to come to them and put my hands 
on the car,' he wrote. 'Shortly after they searched me and put me in the back of the
squad car, where they eventually wrote me out a ticket and released me.'

While Thomas said he accepted the 
law, he said he did not feel citing him for spitting was a valuable use 
of police time - especially as there has recently been a spate of 
attacks on campus.

'I do not understand how students can be harmed and these recent cases 
go unsolved but I am cited for simply spitting on the sidewalk,' he wrote on his Facebook page.

His Facebook post was shared thousands of times - but the misdemeanor and the fee still stand.

Cited: He learned that it is illegal in the city - and many others across the U.S. - to spit on sidewalks

Scene: He said he respects the law but he thinks the police, who stopped him outside the University of Minnesota campus, pictured, should have spent their time stopping more serious crimes elsewhere

Speaking to KARE11 about the incident, he said that he respected the law - but insisted he had just not known it was an offence.

'It is a little wacky,' he said. 'I mean, what can you do though? It is the law. You're 
supposed to obey the laws of the land.'

According to a city ordinance, it is illegal to spit on sidewalks, buses and public areas, KARE reported. The habit is illegal in cities across much of the U.S.

Another ordinance in Minneapolis states that spitting on the 
floor or furnishing of a boat, canoe, building or walkway, is also illegal and comes with a fee of $115.

Thomas conceded that next time, he will 'just bring a bag or something' to spit in.
