First Lady Michelle Obama has appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine for the second time, talking about family values and pushing back at critics who say she and the president need to socialize more.

Mrs Obama, 49, was captured in the April 2013 issue of the magazine - which hits newsstands on March 26 - by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz.

She first appeared on the cover of Vogue in March 2009 - right after her husband was inaugurated for his first term.

In an open, and assertive stance, she leans against a table and looks directly into the camera’s lens with her bare arms resting at her side.

Wearing a Reed Krakoff dress, taken from her own closet, in cerulean blue with a flourish of purple at the neckline, Mrs Obama looks comfortable, at ease, and happy.

By contrast, for Mrs Obama’s debut appearance on the Vogue cover in March 2009, she sat curled on a sofa with her arms lightly wrapped one over the other in a protective gesture; and the discomfort in her facial expression is palpable.

In the accompanying interview, by Jonathan Van Meter, the First Lady summarizes her relationship
to fashion. Her style is mentioned only once in the profile, and in 
just one paragraph - insinuating perhaps that she has more important 
things on her mind.

'I always say that women should wear 
whatever makes them feel good about themselves. That’s what I always try
to do,' she explained.

'I also believe that if you’re 
comfortable in your clothes it’s easy to connect with people and make 
them feel comfortable as well. In every interaction that I have with 
people, I always want to show them my most authentic self.'

For the new issue, she wears the same 
dress for the inside feature with the President, who is dressed in a 
pinstriped shirt and a striped blue tie. Mrs Obama's choice of Reed 
Krakoff for 
the cover is a significant one - she also wore the label in her latest 
official portrait, and for the President's swearing-in.

In the picture, the smiling couple 
are draped over one-and-other - the president's arm on his wife's knee 
and her long arms placed affectionately around his neck.

A
third photograph captures her in profile, wearing a black slim-fitting 
Michael Kors long-sleeve top and fishtail ball skirt - a picture of 
sporty elegance.

Michael Kors has become one of Mrs Obama's most popular go-to choices; she has frequently worn his designs since her entry into The White House five years ago, and even posed for her first official portrait wearing a 
sleeveless Kors shift.

For much of the interview, the first 
lady discusses their family values, explaining that she and the 
President were straightforward when they said - before moving from 
Chicago to Washington in 2009 - that their family, including two young 
daughters Malia and Sasha, would be their priority.

She said 'the stresses and the 
pressures' of the White House are so real that they prefer to spend free
time with their daughters, now 14 and 11.

'Our job is, first and foremost, to make sure our family is whole. You know, we have small kids; they're growing every day,' Mrs Obama said in the interview.

'But I think we were both pretty straightforward when we said, "Our No. 1 priority is making sure that our family is whole."'

She
noted that most of the couple's friends are parents, too, and that when
she and the president go on vacation, usually with longtime friends or 
relatives, they are surrounded by children.

'The stresses and the pressures of 
this job are so real that when you get a minute, you want to give that 
extra energy to your 14- and 11-year-old,' the First Lady said.

Keeping it blue: At the inauguration 
ceremony at the White House in January, she also chose a silk dress by 
Reed Krakoff - the eponymous label set up by Coach's former creative 
head in 2010

The President joked in the Vogue interview that 
he and the First Lady might start hitting the town, now that their 
daughters are older and have less time for them.

'As I joked at a press conference, 
now that they want less time with us, who knows? Maybe you'll see us out
in the clubs,' Obama said.

Mrs Obama added that '90 per cent' of
what she and the President talk about has to do with the girls: what 
they're up to, who has practice, which one of their friends is having a 
birthday party and did they get that person a gift - conversation she 
described as 'endless' and 'pretty exhausting.'

'The Secret Service had to change the way they do things... Because they want to make sure these girls are happy and have a normal life'

She suggested that neither one of 
them wants to miss any of it. Obama grew up without his father and has 
talked publicly about his desire to be there for his kids.

'He's
doing it while still dealing with Syria and health care. He's as up on 
every friend, every party, every relationship,' the First Lady said.

'And if you're out to dinner every 
night, you miss those moments where you can check-in and just figure 
them out when they're ready to share with you.'

Mrs Obama also talked about the struggle to give their growing daughters a 'normal life.'

She
said: 'The Secret Service has to change the way they do things; they 
have to become more flexible. And they do. Because they want to make 
sure that these girls are happy and that they have a normal life.

'There’s a lot of energy that goes 
into working with staff, working with agents, working with friends’ 
parents to figure out how do we, you know, let these kids go to the 
party and have a sleepover and walk through the city on their own, go to
the game.

'It requires us to be there and be present so that we can respond and have the system respond to their needs,' she explained.

sense of style as a powerful tool, often shining the spotlight on 
up-and-coming American designers

Family values: The first lady opens up about family values in the Vogue feature, pushing back at critics who say she and the president need to socialize more

Discussing their 20-year marriage, the president reveals: 'There’s no doubt I’m a better man having spent time with Michelle. I would never say that Michelle’s a better woman, but I will say she’s a little more patient.'

Mrs Obama responded with a smile: 'I would say I’m a better woman.'

The pair also touch on how being in The White House has had an effect on their wardrobes. The President says he went from having only two suits, to dozens.

'Thank god,' said Mrs Obama. 'Let me tell you: This is the man who still boasts about, "This khaki pair of pants I’ve had since I was 20." And I’m like, "You don’t want to brag about that."'

Laughing, the President added: 'Michelle’s like Beyoncé in that song, "Let me upgrade ya!" She upgraded me.'

Mrs Obama is the second First Lady to appear on a Vogue cover. Hillary Clinton appeared in the magazine in 1998.

Vogue's editor, Anna Wintour, was a top fundraiser for the Obama re-election campaign, raking in more than $500,000.

Last year, it was rumored that Wintour was tapped to be the Obama administration's ambassador to London as a result of those efforts, however those rumors were put to rest yesterday when it was announced she had been promoted to 'artistic director' of Condé Nast.
