Arsene Wenger was handed a timely boost ahead of his side's trip to Liverpool this weekend as several first-team players continued their comebacks from injury.

England midfielder Jack Wilshere played 45 minutes and opened the scoring in a friendly against Brentford - his first run-out for the team since suffering an injury against Manchester United in November.

Club captain Mikel Arteta, also absent since November, managed to get through the first half, while French full back Mathieu Debuchy completed 60 minutes.

Debuchy has struggled with injuries in his first season at the club and is currently recovering from his second serious setback of the season, a shoulder injury sustained against Stoke.

Compatriot Mathieu Flamini - who hasn't started a game since February but has been fit enough for the bench in recent weeks - also lasted over an hour, while Abou Diaby managed to play half the match  as he continues his return from yet another injury.

Diaby has played just once this season for the first team - in the Capital One Cup - and three games for the Under 21s. He is hoping to prove himself worthy of a new contract after a career blighted with injuries.

The quartet could now be available for the visit of Brendan Rodgers' side this weekend.

Danny Welbeck, though, remains a doubt after picking up a knee injury during England's win over Lithuania on Friday night. 

Debuchy, who has struggled since joining Arsenal, has been out since January when he injured his shoulder

Young midfielder Dan Crowley started alongside Wilshere in midfield, scoring the second goal 

There was also a run-out for January signing Krystian Bielik, who is yet to feature for the senior side under Arsene Wenger.

But it will be Wilshere's return, coupled with a strong performance, which pleased Wenger most, the 23-year-old marking his comeback with a goal and an assist.

The England star put Arsenal ahead after just  seven minutes before playing in promising youngster Dan Crowley for the second 12 minutes later.

The Gunners Under 21 striker Alex Iwobi added two more before the break in a comfortable victory.

Club captain Mikel Arteta, absent since November, also managed to play half the game against Brentford
