Stripper: Stripper Vicky Miller, pictured, is on trial for the attempted murder of her fiance

A stripper is accused of luring her fiance to an apartment where her then-17-year-old son and his friend tried to kill him by strangling him with an extension cord and bashing him over the head with a fry pan.

Vicky Miller, 44, is on trial for the November 2011 attempted murder of Paul Key, 54, whom she met while dancing topless at Lipstick Cabaret in Dallas and agreed to marry after just 30 minutes.

Prosecutors on Monday said Key drained his 401k and took out a mortgage on his home so he could lavish Miller, who faces unrelated charges of aggravated sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy, with gifts including a car each for her and her son.

'I agreed to support her financially,' Key testified, adding that he spent cash he'd saved over 30 years on the woman. 'I had someone I enjoyed talking with. I thought I could buy loyalty with money.'

He said they regularly met up for breakfast at IHOP following their night shifts and he paid her $2,000 a month to support her so she would quit her job at Lipstick Cabaret.

But the affair, which Key claimed on Tuesday was non-sexual, turned sour after Miller kept putting off the wedding and after three and a half years Key, an AT&T employee, began to think he was being used, Dallasnews.com reported.

He said he decided to break up with her and move forward with his life.

Key, who had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic at age 35, said on Tuesday he had stopped taking his medication about two months before the breakup because he was strapped for cash.

But he said that had no impact on his ability to remember the alleged attempted murder, which he claimed may have been prompted by the inaccurate belief that Miller would receive his life insurance payout.

On November 21, 2011, Miller picked 
up Key at his home and brought him to her apartment so he could pick up 
her belongings, court documents reveal. When he had done so he sat down 
on the couch.

That's when he claims someone yanked an extension cord over his head and around his neck trying to strangle him.

Miller's son, Francisco Hurtado, who is now 19, allegedly then placed a pillow over his head and tried to suffocate the man before his friend, Dunkan Boyce, struck him over the head several times with a pan, police said.

As the extension cord began to cut off his air supply, Key testified on Tuesday that his 'initial inclination was to sit back and observe what it's like to die.' But then he said 'I decided to fight back.'

Key managed to escape the boys' clutches and ran outside screaming for help, finally convincing someone at a nearby Dollar General Store to call 911.

Meanwhile, the teens decided to make it look like Key attacked Miller and rearranged the apartment.

Miller also allegedly asked her son to throw her against a wall, hit her and kick her so she looked beat up.

The
son's friend, Boyce, then calls 911 to report the false assault, but 
can be heard on the call shouting at the others to hurry up.

When police arrive, Key was initially arrested by reporting officers but after further investigation, Miller and the two teens were arrested.

On Monday, defense attorney Robbie McClung told jurors not to judge Miller by her former profession.

'There's not just reasonable doubt,' McClung said. 'There are misperceptions and innuendo that don't make any sense because Vicky Miller is not guilty.'

Trial dates have not yet been set for the teens, though they are listed as potential witnesses in Miller's trial.

If convicted of the second-degree felony, Miller faces two to 20 years in prison.
