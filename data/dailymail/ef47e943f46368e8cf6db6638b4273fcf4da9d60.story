David Cameron concluded a three-day love-in with Barack Obama by comparing him with Theodore Roosevelt and delivering what was seen in the U.S. as a controversial endorsement of four more years of his presidency.

In another extraordinary series of exchanges between the two leaders, the Premier ladelled praise on Mr Obama for pressing the ‘reset button on the moral authority of the entire free world’.

In return, the President hailed Mr Cameron’s leadership and ‘commitment to dignity’, paying tribute to the way he and his wife Samantha contended with the death of their disabled son, Ivan, in 2009.

Today the White House released a collection of photographs capturing the close relationship between the two men.

Making a toast to the Prime Minister 
at a White House banquet, Mr Obama said: ‘I will say something else, 
David: All of us have seen how you as a parent, along with Samantha, 
have shown a measure of strength that few of us will ever know.

'In
all of our interactions including today I’ve learned something about 
David. In good times and in bad he’s just the kind of partner you want 
at your side.

‘I trust him. He says what he does 
and he does what he says. I’ve seen his character. I’ve seen his 
commitment to human dignity during Libya.’

Mr
Cameron, also speaking at the dinner, delivered what the official 
transcript of the White House press corps said was ‘essentially an 
endorsement of another four years of Obama’.

Though
aides denied the PM’s remarks had been intended that way, they will 
heighten controversy over his failure to meet any of the Republican 
candidates for the presidency during his visit. The Conservatives and 
the Republicans are traditionally aligned.

Mr Cameron said: ‘There are three things about Barack that really stand out for me: Strength, moral authority and wisdom. Strength because Barack has been strong when required to defend his national interests. Under President Obama’s leadership, America got Bin Laden.’

Mr Cameron said Mr Obama had renewed the moral leadership of the U.S., and compared him with President Roosevelt, one of the most reforming presidents of the 20th century who established the principle that the U.S. wields soft power around the world and was the first American to win the Nobel Prize.

‘He has pressed the reset button on the moral authority of the entire free world,’ the Prime Minister said, adding: ‘Barack, it is an honour to call you an ally, a partner and a friend.’

Mr Cameron was criticised back in Britain by Tory MP Nadine Dorries, who said: ‘When Obama made a visit to Britain in the build-up to a general election he was courteous and met with the then leader of the opposition, David Cameron.

Walkabout: Both leaders paid tribute to relations between Britain and the U.S.

Down to business: Among the items on the agenda were Afghanistan, Syria and the extradition treaty between Britain and the U.S.

‘It’s a pity the PM couldn’t return 
the same courtesy to the key candidates of the Republican party during 
his visit in the run-up to the U.S. elections. It’s also puzzling that 
he chose to make a political endorsement during a state visit.’

A
No 10 source said: ‘You would expect David Cameron to speak highly of 
the President. They have a very good relationship. But on a political 
level we remain neutral.’

Talking
about the White House banquet later, Mr Cameron said: ‘I had the First 
Lady on my right, and she had George Clooney next to her. That’s tough 
competition!’

Among the
British guests at the dinner were Damian Lewis, currently starring in 
the President’s favourite TV programme Homeland, and his actress wife 
Helen McCrory, Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville and Sir Richard 
Branson.
