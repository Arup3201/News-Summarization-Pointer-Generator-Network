Police say a Pennsylvania man dropped to the ground and rolled around in dog waste to avoid being arrested for public drunkenness, but he was taken into custody anyway.

Police in Wilkes-Barre tell the Times Leader  officers came upon 45-year-old Maurice Franklin early Monday night after he jumped into traffic.

They believed he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

They say he slurred his words and could not stand without swaying.

The incident occurred at around 5.50pm Monday in the area of Academy Street and Carey avenue. 

Franklin claimed he was walking erratically to avoid stepping in the dog feces on the sidewalk.

But when Officer Stanley Wychock told Franklin that he was under arrest and ordered him to place his hands behind his back, Franklin avoided the dog feces no longer.

Instead, police say, he lay down on the ground and began rolling in the waste.

'The defendant then stated that officers could not arrest him because he is covered in (expletive),' officials wrote in an account of the incident posted to the Wilkes-Barre City Police Department Information Facebook page. 

Franklin was taken into custody, cited, and held until he was sober, the Times Leader reports.  

Franklin couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Court records don't list a lawyer for him.
