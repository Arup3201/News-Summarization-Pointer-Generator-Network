They could be used for everything from covert surveillance to delivering CDs.

But when the Portuguese Navy tried to launch its own drone in front of the nation's media, things did not quite go as planned.

Portugal's Defence Minister looked on helplessly as a sailor launched the buzzing device with a running jump - and it crashed straight into the water.

Lift-off: The drone, circled, was launched by the Portguese Navy in front of the nation's Defence Minister...and immediately ditched into the harbour. He admitted: 'This is why we need to invest in a lot of training'

The device, a partnership between the Navy and a private firm, was unveiled on Wednesday at the Lisbon Naval Base by Portugal's military elite.

Defence Minister José Pedro Aguiar-Branco and Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Macieira Fragoso looked on as the high-tech drone prepared to launch.

It would 'be highly effective in missions the Navy has to fulfill', the Minister declared, according to Portuguese newspaper Diário de Notícias.

Officials excitedly claimed it would perform search and rescue missions, fisheries enforcement, maritime safety and combat pollution under civilian use.

But when it came to the big launch in front of assembled journalists, the unmanned craft ditched immediately into the harbour.

Preparation: Before the launch the Defence Minister said the craft would be vital for Navy operations

Anticipation: With the craft buzzing loudly, the unnamed sailor took a run-up before hurling it skywards

A video of the disastrous PR stunt has already been viewed online more than 250,000 times.

A second launch shortly afterwards did succeed, officials said, and followed the flight plan which had originally been laid down for it.

The Minister admitted: 'This explains why it is always necessary to invest a lot in training at
 the right time so that tasks do not fail.'

Since basic drones went on sale for as little as £60 they have been used for everything from taking selfies to scouting out houses to burgle.

This week Google bought out a firm which makes military-style drones for £36million, sparking fears the internet giant's high-quality mapping could push the boundaries of people's rights to privacy.

Whoops: The test 'pilot' could only watch as the craft was held aloft for no more than a few seconds
