Pre-orders for the new iPhones began last week ahead of its official launch on Friday.

And now all of the major UK network operators have announced their monthly contract prices.

Both handsets have been criticised for being too expensive. To buy the iPhone 5C outright, prices start at £469 for the 16GB model, or £549 for the 32GB version, while the iPhone 5S costs at least £549 for the 16GB model, with 32 and 64GB handsets costing £629 and £709 respectively.

Only contract details for the iPhone 5C have been released, with prices for the iPhone 5S expected to be announced on 20 September.
