Escape: Candice Kelly is accused of fleeing in a police car after stealing a laptop

A Florida woman suspected of stealing a laptop is facing more serious charges after stealing a police car and breaking into a stranger's house.

When Candice Kelly was being interviewed by police outside a Best Buy on Wednesday, she allegedly jumped in the car, locked the doors and sped off.

But her apparent bid for freedom was short lived when a homeowner caught her allegedly trying to steal his wife's purse from inside their house.Â 

Police who
 had given chase when Kelly took off in their car found her a short 
distance away, after hearing a man and woman yelling.

When officers reached the property they found Mark Gledhill holding Kelly to the ground outside.

He
 said he had been doing repair work in the bathroom when he heard his 
patio door slide open, and saw Kelly allegedly going through his wife's 
purse.

'I didn't think I just reacted I thought someone is in my house I need to stop them and call the police,' Gledhill told WPBF.

Officers handcuffed Kelly and put her in custody, where she is facing charges including retail theft, grand theft auto and escape.

The police said Kelly got away from them while they were questioning her outside their car.
