A teenager has died after her best friend became distracted while driving her and hit a barrier - impaling the girl on a metal guardrail.

Alexia Douglas, 16, died on impact after Christina Shiver, who had only just passed her driving test, lost control of her SUV in St. Petersburg, Florida at 7pm on Friday and smacked into a barrier.

The car jumped the curb onto the sidewalk. Authorities say metal 
guardrails pierced through the passenger's side windshield, killing Alexia immediately.

Christina, also 16, was treated in hospital but only suffered minor injuries. A witness said that she believed her best friend was still alive and wanted to ride with her in the ambulance to hospital.

'I just looked away for a second,' she said, according to Doug Ruppel, who spoke to the Tampa Bay Times after witnessing the deadly crash.

Alexia's mother remembered how the girls were inseparable.

'They were always, always together,' Barbara Nicholl said. 'They got along with everybody, but they always said 
they were each others' only friend. Every weekend it was Alexia and 
Christina.'

The girls, who met at middle school, would spend every Friday and Saturday night together and watch music channels, play computer games and chat about the next concert they would attend.

On the night of the tragedy, the girls did not have any set plans, but discussed going to the mall or watching films together.

The girls attended Northeast High School, where counselors are on hand to speak with students. Alexia ranked in the top one per cent of her sophomore class, the Times reported.

'Everybody is just distraught about it,' principal Kevin Hendrick said.

Nicholl said that police officers came to her door at 8pm on Friday and she immediately panicked about whether Alexia was in trouble.

But the officers told her that Christina had been driving the girls in her  2008 Ford Escape when she became distracted and swerved right, mounted a barrier and crashed into a guardrail.

Authorities have not suggested how she was distracted.

Nicholl said she is still struggling to digest their news.

'I've talked to Christina's mom, but not 
Christina,' she said. 'I'm afraid I'll ask too many questions, and I'm 
not ready to hear the answers. Not yet.'

The investigation is ongoing and a funeral will be held for Alexia on Thursday.
