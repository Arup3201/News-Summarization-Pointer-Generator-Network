After 38 minutes Michael Oliver reached for his vanishing spray and a rowdy cheer came from the Wembley crowd as he marked out a Manchester City free-kick. 

How much fun can a tin of shaving foam bring to English football?

Having fun: The vanishing spray got the biggest cheer of the day when Michael Oliver pulled it out 

No wonder we're behind

Roy Hodgson must have groaned when he saw only three English starters, all Arsenal: Kieran Gibbs, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere.

Ajax, meanwhile, started the Dutch season with 11 of their 23-man squad having graduated from their Under Sevens

The deluge had eased in time for kick-off but fans had to deal with flash flooding which caused Tube closures, and brollies were up in the stadium, for the first time since Steve McClaren in 2007, to keep BT Sport's team dry.

City stars suited not booted

Manuel Pellegrini had his non-playing stars at the stadium in force, looking sharp in club suits. 

Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho, Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis were all there with new boys Bacary Sagna and Frank Lampard.

Alvaro Negredo had his broken foot in a protective boot.

Mikel Arteta led out Arsenal soon after Thomas Vermaelen had completed his move to Barcelona and the Spanish midfielder has been named as Arsene Wenger's sixth permanent captain in nine years since Patrick Vieira left. 

Not a bad way to start, using trophy-lifting muscles his predecessors never did.
