Southern Australia is in the grip of a widespread heatwave, with temperatures exceeding 40C in many areas causing hundreds of bushfires, thousands of lightning storms, and leaving players and ball boys collapsing on court at the Australian Open.

One woman was hospitalised after bushfires broke out in two states, and players at the Australian Open in Melbourne have complained of “inhumane” conditions after one hallucinated that he saw Snoopy mid-match, a ball boy fainted, one player vomited, and drink bottles melted on court where the mercury tipped 42.8C yesterday.

Canadian qualifier Frank Dancevic hallucinated then fainted during his first-round match to Frenchman Benoit Paire. He was unconscious for almost a minute but returned to the court before losing the match.

‘I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow Snoopy, that's weird,’ Dancevic said.

‘I couldn't keep my balance anymore and I leaned over the fence and when I woke up people were all around me.’

Britain's Andy Murray said Australian Open organisers were risking a tragedy by allowing the competition to continue in such extreme temperatures.

‘As much as it's easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen,’ Murray said. ‘And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. That's not great.

‘Whether it's safe or not, I don't know. There's been some issues in other sports with players having heart attacks.’

Former women's world No.1 Caroline Wozniacki said the bottom of her water bottle started melting when she placed it on the court.

‘It feels like I was sweating in a sauna or something,’ Wozniacki said.

Tournament organisers said while conditions were hot and uncomfortable, there was no need to invoke the extreme weather policy.

'The relatively low level of humidity ensured that conditions never deteriorated to a point where we needed to invoke the extreme heat policy,' Australian Open tournament referee Wayne McKewen said yesterday.

Temperatures have soared in Victoria, South Australia and southern New South Wales over recent days and relief is unlikely to come until the end of the week. Sydney and Perth have been spared the worst of the conditions this week, but Melbourne and Adelaide are suffering from prolonged highs of up to 45C.

Fire bans are in place in Victoria and South Australia where the country town of Keith sweltered under a high of 47C yesterday. This week is set to be the hottest on record for Adelaide, which today faces a maximum of 45C, and tomorrow is set to reach 46C, with weather forecasters predicting the city’s temperature records could be broken. The Adelaide record of 46.1C was set on January 12, 1939.

Adding to the nightmare, the heat also brought thunderstorms that sparked bushfires across South Australia, which was hit by some 26,000 lightning strikes yesterday.

A 49-year-old woman was hospitalised with burns and smoke inhalation after she was injured when a fire destroyed her home at Rockleigh, near Monarto Zoo, south-east of Adelaide, and burned through an estimated 4500ha of scrub.

A total fire ban remains in place in Victoria, where crews are bracing for horror conditions on Friday that are the worst the state has been faced with since the deadly Black Saturday blazes in 2009.

At least 250 separate blazes continued to burn overnight, including one which destroyed a country café on the picturesque Mornington Peninsula. It was an uncomfortable night’s sleep for many in Melbourne as the mercury hovered in the mid-30s, making it the second-hottest night on record. Many flocked to the beach to try and get some relief from the heat. It is forecast to rise to 42 again in Melbourne today. 

Acting Victorian Premier Peter Ryan warned conditions were some of the worst Victoria has faced in recent years and urged people to take care in the coming days.

‘These next four days promise to be amongst the most significant we have faced in Victoria since Black Saturday (in 2009),’ he said.

Fire Services commissioner Craig Lapsley said Victoria is not as dry as it was in 2009, but warned that Friday ‘is the peak danger day in Victoria this week’.

While Western Australia has been spared the high temperatures this week, a bushfire destroyed 52 homes when it raged through Perth Hills on Sunday.

The blaze started in Parkerville before spreading to Stoneville and burning through almost 400 hectares.

This week’s soaring temperatures came as the national weather bureau launched a new heatwave forecast service and released the first official definition of a heatwave:  three or more days of unusually high maximum and minimum temperatures in any area.

Heatwaves have taken more Australian lives than any other natural hazard in the past 200 years, according to the weather bureau.

Assistant Director for Weather Services, Alasdair Hainsworth, warned the prolonged high temperatures posed serious health risks.

‘Severe and extreme heatwaves pose significant risks to human health and safety, in particular for the elderly, who are more vulnerable to the effects of heat stress,’ he said.
