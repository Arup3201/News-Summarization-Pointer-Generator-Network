Jane Wilde and Stephen Hawking were married for 30 years. Pictured together at The Theory of Everything premiere 

Stephen Hawking’s first wife has revealed how the scientist’s devotion to ‘the goddess Physics’ and his fame and success damaged their marriage and saw him neglect his family.

Jane Wilde was married to the professor for 30 years, helping him defy doctors who gave him only two years to live after he was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease as a 22-year-old Cambridge graduate.

Now she has spoken about the severe problems caused by his growing renown, the pressure she came under to idolise him and her guilt at relying on their son Robert to care for his father when the boy was only ten.

Her decision to leave Professor Hawking for choirmaster Jonathan Jones is also discussed in an interview with Radio Times, given to mark the release of the film The Theory Of Everything based on her memoir Travelling To Infinity and starring Eddie Redmayne as Hawking and Felicity Jones as Jane.

Miss Wilde, 70, said ‘the goddess Physics’ became ‘Stephen’s idol’ and he would sometimes spend ‘a whole weekend in his wheelchair, elbow resting on his knee like Rodin’s Thinker. He wouldn’t take any notice of the children, or of me, and I would become very worried’.

In 1988, shortly after the publication of his book A Brief History Of Time, which has sold 10million copies in 40 languages and in which he explains how our universe began, Miss Wilde said ‘life became very complicated.

‘I rather felt that the family had been left behind. To me, Stephen was my husband and the father of my children; one does not say to one’s husband, “Oh, you’re so clever! I must worship the ground under your feet, or in this case, wheels”. I found this kind of sycophantic attitude – the attitude adopted by so many people around Stephen – exceptionally frustrating.’

Professor Hawking’s condition has left him in a wheelchair for almost half a century and able to communicate only through a voice synthesizer operated by a muscle in his cheek.

Miss Wilde has three children, Robert, Lucy, and Tim, with Professor Hawking, now 72. As his health deteriorated, they shunned help from carers for many years and Miss Wilde confesses she turned to Robert, the eldest child.

She said: ‘There were times when it became all too much. The hardest thing was that in my exhaustion I grew to depend on Robert, when he was only about ten years old. Our gorgeous child who was so willing to help was having to do things for his father that children really shouldn’t have to.

‘Stephen didn’t want to admit that we needed “outside” help because every stage of deterioration – walking with a stick, having to be fed, having to resort to a wheelchair – hit him very hard. Naturally he was in denial but also his mind was so deeply involved with the intellectual realms of research into the origins of the universe that he did not have time to think about more mundane matters.’

When carers were eventually brought in, the scenario was not as Miss Wilde had hoped: ‘I expected that carers came into the home to help look after the disabled person and respect the rest of the family. Very few of them did that. I was desperate; I didn’t think I could carry on, because I was so drained.’

She met musician Jonathan Jones through singing in a church choir and a deep friendship followed.

Realising they were drawn to each other, she wrestled with her feelings and the tie to Professor Hawking she did not feel able to sever. She said: ‘It would have been easier, in some ways, simply to have walked away, but I could not contemplate doing that because I had devoted myself to Stephen and the children for so long.’

Miss Wilde hints a third party may eventually have caused the breakdown of her marriage, saying: ‘The end of the marriage was very traumatic. It was predictable that someone would exploit the situation and tell Stephen that he shouldn’t be putting up with such an arrangement.’

She separated from Professor Hawking in 1990 and they later divorced. He went on to marry his carer, Elaine Mason, in 1995, and their marriage, which ended after 11 years, was dogged by allegations that Miss Mason physically abused him – claims he has always denied.

Miss Wilde married Mr Jones in 1997 but says she always remained in Professor Hawking’s life: ‘After all the years that Stephen and I were together, all we had achieved together and the three children we had had together, I still felt that I was needed in a rather ill-defined, protective way.

‘After Stephen’s second divorce, it became possible for us to communicate again. He lives ten minutes from us and I call in every so often to discuss family matters. When the family are here in Cambridge, we have meals together.’

This month the pair were pictured together at the premiere of The Theory Of Everything.
