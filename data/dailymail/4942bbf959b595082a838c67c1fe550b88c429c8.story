The superbug which has forced Australian swimming legend Ian Thorpe into 'around-the-clock' hospital care was picked up in a Sydney hospital, MailOnline can confirm.

Contrary to initial reports that Thorpe, 31, was infected following a shoulder operation in Switzerland, his manager Will Erskine confirmed the bug was picked up in February following surgery in Sydney.

He described as 'incorrect' reports that Thorpe picked up the debilitating infection after surgery near his home in Ronco sopra Ascona.

'He was operated on in Sydney at the end of January and it was no good the first time,' Mr Erskine said.

'He had to have a couple of repeats...the surgery was done in Sydney subsequently in late February, that's when he picked it up.'

Mr Erskine said the five-time Olympic gold-medalist hasn't been to Switzerland since 'mid to late last year'.

There are rumours circulating that Thorpe's initial shoulder surgery was carried out by a prominent sports physician based in the western Sydney suburb of Bankstown, something his manager would not confirm or deny.

'I can confirm (the infection) is not golden staph, which raises alarm bells for everyone,' said Mr Erskine.

'They're bugs you can pick up when you go into hospital...He's receiving around-the-clock care.

'Is there a possibility that he'll lose mobility in his arm or that they will potentially have to amputate? It's a minuscule possibility.'

Mr Erskine estimated the chances that doctors would have to perform such a drastic operation to be less than one per cent.

He would not reveal the specific bug that Thorpe is battling, aided by 'continuous' antibiotic drips. He also said his client was not in intensive care.

'He's in good spirits,' he said.

Earlier, Will's father James Erskine - who also manages Ian Thorpe - told Channel 9's Today the Olympic legend looked like the 'bionic man' but rubbished suggestions he could lose movement in his left arm.

'If you saw him he’s in good spirits, he’s got drips and antibiotics, drains all that kind of thing so he’s not exactly going to swim in the Commonwealth Games tomorrow,' Erskine told Today.

'I saw him yesterday he’s not in intensive care, he’s a sick boy, he’s not going to get out, roam around and have cups of coffee or meet Prince William in the next day.

'He’s fighting it, he’s got an infection. He’s battling, he’s unlucky and how long it’s going to take to clear up I don’t know.

'There have  been some very serious consequences of these infections and he’s aware of that and that’s why he’s getting the best treatment.'

Thorpe revealed in his 2013 autobiography This Is Me he has been battling 'crippling' depression since just after the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

In early February, shortly after Thorpe's first ill-fated shoulder operation, he was found in a 'dazed and disoriented state' by police in Panania - another western Sydney suburb. He was admitted into rehab days later.
