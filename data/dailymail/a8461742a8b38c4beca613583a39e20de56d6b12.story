After a victory over Roma that wasn't exactly plain sailing, Manchester City's players got some well-deserved rest on their flight home on Thursday.

Goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta saw the Premier League champions seal a 2-0 win at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night - a result that saw them qualify as Group E runners-up at the expense of their opponents.

Manuel Pellegrini's squad had little time to enjoy their victory as they trained early on Thursday morning in the Italian capital at Lazio's Formello facilities; the base of Roma's arch-rivals.

The players were back to business as stars including Joe Hart, David Silva and James Milner were put through their paces ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Leicester.

Then the likes of Fernando, Gael Clichy and Stevan Jovetic had a little snooze on the plane as they headed back for Manchester. 

City currently trail leaders Chelsea by three points in the Premier League table ahead of the trip to the Foxes. 

Jose Mourinho's side entertain Hull at Stamford Bridge on Saturday knowing that any slip ups will surely be punished by Pellegrini's in-form outfit.
