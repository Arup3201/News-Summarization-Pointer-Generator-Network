A man claiming to be a British banker says he has quit working in the City in order to join Islamic extremists fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

Using the nom de guerre Abu A'ntaar, the man is said to have told Russian media that he hated 'being ruled by laws other than Allah's' and was sick of the 'self-indulgence' of rich people in London.

The man, who says he is a former business analyst, reportedly stated that he 'hates democracy' and is happy to be living under sharia law in the Middle East, claiming brutal ISIS militants are 'leading the way' and showing the world how a religious life should be lived.

ISIS, which rebranded as Islamic State after declaring the foundation of a caliphate in the vast swaths of the Middle East under its control, was this week revealed to be the wealthiest terror group in history - raking in £3 million a day through oil smuggling, extortion, theft and human trafficking.

The alleged former banker turned ISIS militant, whose real name is not known, is said to have revealed aspects of his past life in conversation with Moscow-based news agency Russia Today.

The state-owned broadcaster claims to have been exchanging encrypted instant messages with Abu A'ntaar for the past month, but had a request for a video or audio interview rejected after the militant reportedly said ISIS' slick media department has banned him from taking part.

Although he was keen for his true identity not to be revealed, the man reportedly said he had turned his back on a lucrative career in finance to fight in Syria and Iraq because it is 'the only place where the shari'a of Allah is applied fully.' 

'I hate democracy and the self- indulgence of the rich….I hate inequality…I hate the corporations who are trying to destroy this world because of tyranny,' he was quoted as adding.

Abu A'ntaar is also said to have raged about a culture of peaceful protests in the West, saying: 'I hate that Palestine was never freed for 70+ years whilst we 'peacefully' held placards on the street.' 

Although he refused to reveal his exact role within the militant group, Russia Today said the man suggested he had been trained as a suicide bomber able to 'destroy' enemies 'at will'.

The alleged former banker is thought to be among up to 1,000 Britons fighting for ISIS in the Middle East - among them the murderer 'Jihadi John', who is responsible for the sickening filmed beheadings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Stephen Sotloff, and of British aid worker David Haines.

The three sickening execution videos all show 'Jihadi John' who speaks with a clear London or southern English accent issuing threats to Western leaders before killing the men with a small knife.

Iraq's new prime minister said foreign ground troops are neither necessary nor wanted in his country's fight against ISIS militants.

In his first interview with foreign media since taking office on September 8, Haider Abadi flatly rejected American suggestions that ground may be required to beat the militants.

Mr Abadi said U.S. air strikes have been helpful in the country's efforts to roll back the Sunni militant group, but stressed that putting foreign boots on the ground 'is out of the question'.

'Not only is it not necessary,' he said, 'We don't want them. We won't allow them. Full stop.'

U.S. general Martin Dempsey yesterday told the Senate armed services committee that Iraq may need American ground troops to fight ISIS.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the move could be required if President Barack Obama's current strategy to fight the group fails to make significant progress.  

Numerous other British jihadists have appeared in ISIS propaganda and recruitment videos, with dozens more using social media sites such as Twitter and Ask.Fm to convince other Muslims living in Western nations to travel to the Middle East to fight alongside the Sunni militants. 

The majority of these Britons have joined the militant group after travelling on commercial airlines to popular tourist airport Antayla in southern Turkey, and crossing over the porous border into Syria.

Such is the extent of the territory under ISIS control in the Middle East, that the border between Syria and Iraq has effectively been removed - allowing the militants relatively free movement across an area the size of Britain, and brutally oppressing a population of four million.

News of Abu A'ntaar had joined ISIS comes as at least nine imams were revealed to be among 15 people arrested in Kosovo today in the second major operation in weeks to try to stem the flow of young ethnic Albanians joining Islamist fighters in Iraq and Syria.

A police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 15 faced charges including 'terrorism, threatening the constitutional order, incitement and religious hate speech'.

In the last such operation on August 11, 40 people were arrested on suspicion of fighting in Iraq and Syria or recruiting insurgents.

Police said that among the imams arrested was an influential Muslim cleric from the Grand Mosque in the capital Pristina. Another was the the leader of an Islamic-rooted political party.

'The majority of those arrested are imams of different mosques belonging to the Islamic Community of Kosovo,' police spokesperson Baki Kelani said.

Most of Kosovo's 1.8 million people are ethnic Albanian Muslims and lead largely secular lives.
