Apple has lived up to its obsession with thin, sexy gadgets by releasing its two new iPads overnight - and Australian fans won't have to wait long to get their hands on one. 

Like the newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, Australia has landed the same release date as the United States and the new products will be on the shelves as early as next week.

While Apple remains tight-lipped on the exact date the devices will hit stores, reports suggest they will be on sale from Friday, October 25.

Apple has lived up to its obsession with thin, sexy gadgets by releasing its two new devices - iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 overnight in California

The ultrathin iPad Air 2, which Apple claims is the world's thinnest tablet at 6.1mm, will range from $619 to $1,019 in Australia.

The new device is 18 per cent thinner than the first iPad Air released 12 months ago.

It packs in the new A8x processor - like the one in the new iphone 6 - for super-fast processing and gaming and comes in three storage variants: 16GB, 64GB and the new 128GB.

The gadget has a ten hour battery life, and a laminated screen with an anti-reflective coating, reduces reflections by 56 per cent.

'The iPad is a simple and magical device, but while it has been beautifully simple on the outside, it has advanced technology jam packed on the inside,' Apple's Time Cook said when the devices were unveiled in California.

'We have sold over 225 million iPads around the world.'

Online pre-orders for the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 will open on Saturday, October 18. 

When the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were released last month, Apple fans queued for days in stores across Australia to be the first to get their hands on the new devices.

The iPhones went on sale on September 19 and those in Australia were among the first to get their hands of the new Apple products

It comes as sales of Apple's iPads have dropped.

Through the first half of this year, Apple had shipped 29.6 million iPads - a 13 percent drop from the same time last year. 

Apple has been facing competition from cheaper tablets running Google's Android operating system.

Besides competition, there's been an overall slowdown in tablet demand.
