A man who murdered his wife after discovering she was having a lesbian affair has been jailed for a minimum of 12 years.

Marion Vita, 48, was stabbed to death by her husband Tony at their family home in Glasgow last September.

He flew into a rage having earlier discovered his wife of 19 years was in a sexual relationship with 34-year-old fraud analyst Elwira Rumniak.

Vita, 47, who claimed the death was an ‘accident’, yesterday returned to the  High Court in Glasgow after earlier being convicted of murder.

Judge Sean Murphy, QC, jailed him for life, saying: ‘This is an incredibly sad case and has had tragic consequences for  everyone who knew her, including you.

‘You had lived an exemplary life but all of that ended when you discovered she was having an affair with another woman.’

Vita – who often broke down at his trial in March – showed no emotion as he was led handcuffed to the cells.

A jury heard how Mrs Vita secretly started seeing Miss Rumniak soon after they first met in 2012. She eventually spent most of her time at Miss Rumniak’s home in Edinburgh.

Mrs Vita, who worked as a manager at the Crown Office in the city, later proposed to her lover and the pair even discussed starting a family together.

The affair then came to light last September 19 – the night before the killing – when Vita found intimate messages between the women on his son’s iPad.

Miss Rumniak told the trial: ‘Marion said, “He knows about us”. He had discovered text messages. I went up to her and held her really tightly. I said, “we will be OK”.’

Miss Rumniak recalled Vita sending ‘horrendous’ texts including one to her.

She said: ‘He mentioned Auschwitz and how he wanted me to suffer more than what happened there.’

Vita meantime put an entry in a calendar which read “Marion = cheating lesbian whore” and  cut his wife out of family photographs.

The court heard Mrs Vita went to meet her husband the next night at their Glasgow home – and it was there, in a rage, he stabbed her four times. The  couple’s 11-year-old son later told how he discovered his mother unconscious on the couch.

In an interview with police, he added: ‘Her lips were quite grey. She was not moving at all. She was lying on the sofa, sort of on her side.’

In evidence, Vita said he did not realise his wife was injured that night and that she had died due to a bizarre accident when she fell on the knife during a struggle.

He also told how he had gone upstairs and stabbed himself twice in a failed suicide attempt.

Judge Murphy yesterday praised the Vitas’ son, adding: ‘He will have to come to terms with the loss of his mother and the imprisonment of his father.’

Outside court, Jennifer Harrower, Procurator Fiscal for Homicides and Serious Crime in the West of Scotland, said: ‘Yet again a knife used in anger has left  family and friends devastated at the loss of a loved one.’
