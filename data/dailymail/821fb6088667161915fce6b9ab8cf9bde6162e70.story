Amelie Mauresmo was a long way from being even a glint in Andy Murray’s eye the last time he faced Novak Djokovic in a Grand Slam.

So much has changed for both players since the historic 2013 Wimbledon final, including the arrival of new faces in their coaching boxes — two former SW19 champions.

Mauresmo is on one side and Boris Becker the other, while the Sphinx of player support benches, Ivan Lendl, has departed to spend more time with his golf clubs and tennis academy.

Facing the world No 1 in the US Open quarter-final is the biggest test so far for the innovative Murray-Mauresmo axis, as she tries to prepare her charge for the Serb, who looks in irresistible form.

While not as stone-faced as Lendl, the phlegmatic Frenchwoman has adopted a stoic presence courtside, even when the 27-year-old Scot is letting off steam by ranting in her direction. It will be a new experience for her, if one that every one of his coaches has gone through before, even Lendl on very rare occasions. Normally Murray does not benefit from such behaviour, although in Monday’s gruelling win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga it seemed to energise him to fight back.

Mauresmo takes a markedly different view to Lendl, who said he would leave if Murray mouthed off to him in matches.

Reflecting on how she handles Murray’s sporadic on-court rages she said: ‘I stay calm, I observe. I look at him a lot, see how he reacts to different moments in the match, to different things that are happening on the court, how he then reacts after he is getting vocal or whatever.

‘It’s interesting. Sometimes I like it, sometimes less. We are all different, and the idea is to find what suits you the best. 

'I am not sure he got angry, he just pumps himself up in this way. I stay calm almost all the time, but he knows we are there for him, always behind him.’

In some parts of the equality-obsessed New York media Murray is hailed as a hero for hiring a woman, although he has always maintained it was purely about finding the best person to suit him, which happened to be Mauresmo.

Becker admits he was ‘a little surprised’ at Murray hiring Mauresmo, but described the 2006 Wimbledon champion as a ‘very intelligent and pleasant woman who knows the game very well’.

‘The collaboration with Dani (Vallverdu, his assistant coach) seemed to be working very well at the French Open but something obviously wasn’t working quite right for Andy or he wouldn’t have appointed her,’ said the German.

Regardless of that, Murray is second favourite  against the man who two months ago deposed him as Wimbledon champion. One reason is their matches tend to be very arduous and Djokovic has spent three and half hours less time on court in getting this far.

‘If you do want to win the tournament you want to spend as little time as possible on the early rounds,’ said Becker. ‘I am very pleased Novak has won his matches quickly. He and Andy are chess players on the tennis court and that is why they tend to have marathon matches.’

Djokovic has beaten Murray in four of their last five meetings, that heady afternoon at the All England Club being the exception, although two years ago Murray overcame him in this Arthur Ashe Stadium to claim his first Grand Slam.

And with the way things have gone this season the pressure is all on the Serb, which ought to allow the British No 1 to hit freely, and he must ensure that his vulnerable second serve does not end up getting treated like a punchbag.
