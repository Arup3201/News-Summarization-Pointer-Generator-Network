Match of the Day commentator Jonathan Pearce got more than he bargained for at the Emirates on Sunday afternoon, when a rogue sprinkler soaked him ahead of kick-off.

The 55-year-old BBC stalwart was preparing to present a piece to camera ahead of Arsenal's match with Everton, but got caught short when a sprinkler was turned on just seconds before he went on air.

'You could have told us', Pearce can be heard saying after he jumped out of shot - and out of reach of the water - but he appeared to take it in good spirits when he explained the reason for his soaking on air minutes later.

Pearce later laughed off the incident when he eventually made it onto air, saying it was 'very funny'

'Just as we were getting ready to do this piece,' Pearce explained, 'go on, have a laugh, have a laugh... the sprinkler came on behind me, and I'm absolutely drenched. So yeah, very funny, this Sunday lunchtime.'

Pearce was at the Emirates to see Arsenal attempt to take three points against Everton, a result which would see them go third in the Premier League table, ahead of Manchester United.

Louis van Gaal's side beat Sunderland 2-0 at Old Trafford on Saturday to go above the Gunners, but Arsenal could recapture third place with a win.
