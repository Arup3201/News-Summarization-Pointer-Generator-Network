A controversial Swedish artist is under investigation in Poland amid claims he created a painting using ashes taken from a Nazi concentration camp.

Carl Michael von Hausswolff sparked outrage last month when he claimed that he had stolen ashes from the Majdanek camp in eastern Poland in 1989 and more than two decades later mixed them with water to use as paint.

The resultant painting was displayed at a gallery in the Swedish city of Lund.

Outrage: Carl Michael von Hausswolff has painted a picture using ashes which he claims to have taken from the crematorium of a Nazi concentration camp in Poland

Following media reports of the furore 
surrounding the artwork, the Polish Prosecutor's Office yesterday 
confirmed that Mr von Hausswolff's claims are now being investigated, 
according to the Times of Israel.

A spokesman added that there is currently no evidence and that Swedish investigators will be asked to provide help.

If investigators do find truth in his claims, then Mr von Hausswolff could be charged with 
desecrating human ash or a resting place.

Mr von Hausswolff said last year that 
he had visited the Polish town of Lublin, close to the Majdanek 
concentration camp, in 1989 to exhibit some of his work in a gallery 
there.

He said he was 'gathering material for the exhibition' when he visited the camp.

He added: ‘I gathered some ashes from one of the 
cremation ovens, but did not use it for the exhibition – the material 
was too charged with the cruelties which had taken place.

But in 2010 he did use the ashes and his painting caused outcry among art critics.

Author and translator Salomon Schulman called the artwork ‘nauseating, obsessed necrophilia’.

With what he calls ‘posthumous 
disgust’, Mr Schulman asked last month: ‘Some of the ashes may be from one of my 
relatives? Maybe even a brother of my flesh?’

‘It is repulsive beyond the extreme’, he told Swedish television.

Swedish police had received a complaint from a member of the public who said the 
painting breaks the Swedish law protecting buried human remains.

‘It is a strange complaint which we will investigate,’ detective Stephan Söderholm said at the time.

The work was displayed at the Martin 
Bryder Gallery in the southern Swedish city of Lund as part of an 
exhibition called 'Memory Works'.

The exhibition also featured a picture of the ruins of Nazi military officer Hermann Goring's hunting cabin at the camp.

The gallery owner, martin Bryder, had 
defended the decision to put the work on display, saying that the 
intention was not to cause upset.

But he later cancelled the exhibition 
amid protests from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which described the 
painting as an 'abomination' and the Jewish community of Malmo.

Built on the outskirts of the Polish city of Lublin, Majdanek concentration camp was not originally intended for use as an extermination camp but the Nazi's but instead as one of forced labour.

It was only at the onset of Operation Reinhard that its function changed and more than 79,000 people, including 59,000 Polish Jews, died at the camp during the 34 months of the operation.

The site was captured nearly intact in July 1944 and remains the best preserved concentration camp of the Holocaust.

It was nicknamed Majdanek, or Little Majdan, by locals because of its unusual proximity to the city of Lublin.

Unlike many other concentration camps, which were situated in rural areas, Majdanek could actually be seen from the city and neighboured the Majdan Tatarski area.

Although the Nazis knew the camp initially as the Prisoner of War Camp of the Waffen-SS in Lublin, and later as Knzentrationslager Lublin (or Concentration Camp Lublin), it became remembered by its local name.

Construction work initially began in October 1941, but continued throughout its existence.

The site is now around half the size it was when captured and is currently a museum.
