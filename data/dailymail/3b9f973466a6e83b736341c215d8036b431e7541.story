Nottingham Forest have secured a huge transfer coup with the free transfer of Barcelona's captain...of their Under-19s side.

Centre back Roger Riera is moving to the City Ground after nine years with the Catalan giants - being brought up through the famous La Masia academy that produced the likes of Lionel Messi, Xavi and Andres Iniesta.

But after captaining every level of Barca's youth sides that he played for, Riera did not have his contract renewed and is delighted to be making the move to England and Stuart Pearce's side.

Winner: Roger Riera holds aloft the UEFA Youth League trophy as Barcelona Under-19s' captain

Delight: While it might not be sunny Spain, Riera is looking forward to getting started in Nottingham

Spanish roots: But Riera was deemed surplus to requirements at the Nou Camp despite his youth side heroics

Riera is a 6ft2in centre back noted for his ability in the air and leadership qualities. Unsurprisingly given his Barca roots, he is good with the ball at his feet, too.

He won nine titles in nine years with the Catalan club and picked up the Nike cup as well as the UEFA Youth League title.

The 19-year-old tweeted: 'Today I start a new chapter in my life at @Official_NFFC . I'm really excited about this new project and I'm gonna give all for this team'.
