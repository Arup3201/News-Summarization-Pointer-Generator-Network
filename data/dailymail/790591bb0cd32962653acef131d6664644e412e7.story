Countries from around the world have tried a variety of methods to stimulate growth in the face of a crippling economic crisis.

But its highly likely that none have been as bizarre as Japan's latest efforts to boost the economy.

The country's music industry has launched a new four-member girl band with the premise that if the nation's stocks are performing well, the girl's skirts will get shorter.

The group is called Machikado Keiki☆JAPAN - which translates to Street Corner Conditions JAPAN.

As reported by Rocket News 24, the management behind the band says that for every 1,000 yen increase in the stock price average, the skirts will get shorter at their concerts.

However, since the creation of the group, stock prices in Japan have risen dramatically, meaning the girls will perform their first show completely skirtless.

The link between the miniskirt and Japan's economy is not a new development.

Change: As this picture shows, when the economy is not doing so well, the skirts get longer

During the economic boom of the 1960s, the popularity of miniskirts exploded, largely thanks to British supermodel Twiggy.

However, when the economy tumbled during the oil crisis in 1973, the popularity of miniskirts declined. But when the country's finances boomed again in the 1980s, they again surged back into the mainstream.

Machikado Keiki☆JAPAN is made up of Sakura Yuki, 20, Kanon Mori, 23, Jun Akami, 17, and Hinako Kuroki, 16.
