A horrified mother found her 13-year-old daughter and her friend discussing the best way to make a sex tape after reading an X-rated e-book.

Alarmed Melissa Crighton, 45, has now called on publishers to give books special adult ratings in an attempt to protect children.

Ms Crighton caught her child and a pal reading aloud from 'It's All About The Sex Face: A Guide To Becoming A Celebrity'.

Sex tapes: A London mother wants to put adult ratings on e-books to prevent children from accessing adult material after she caught her daughter reading how to make a sex tape to become famous. US reality TV personality Kim Kardashian, pictured, settled for $5 million to block distribution of a sex tape

The no-holds-barred manual gives explicit tips on how to produce a steamy sex video in an easy bid to achieve instant fame.

The e-book, which costs just £1.02 to download from Amazon, claims you can 'actually become famous without even having a talent'.

Sex tapes involving socialites such as Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and actress Pamela Anderson, which have been leaked onto the internet, have forced them into the public eye. Some claim the tapes have furthered their celebrity status and careers.

The NSPCC is now urging all parents to monitor their children's e-book reading and said all book retailers, on or offline, have a responsibility to prevent children buying hardcore adult material.

Adult rating: The young girls were caught reading allowed from e-book: 'Its All About The Sex Face: A Guide To Becoming A Celebrity'

Ms Crighton, of West Hampstead, north London, said: 'They were reading out the steps in the book about how to make a sex tape - how to produce it, how to get a co-star and how to leak it.

'I interrupted them and took the Kindle away and I spoke to them and said, "This is not a book you should be reading".'

The mother-of-two added: 'I found the subject matter inappropriate.

'They have gone online to find books about how to get famous so it's worrying if this kind of stuff is being sold.'

Ms Crighton said the raunchy e-book was downloaded by her daughter's mate on her mother's Kindle.

Ms Crighton said she tipped the other mother off about the worrying incident immediately and the book was deleted.

'I think for kids a novel on a Kindle seems more like an app, something you can quickly download,' said the furious web designer.

'It's more accessible than going into a shop, so it's more difficult to monitor what children are reading.

'The Government should do something where they get publishers to say what is in the book or give them a rating.'

Guidance and 'gentle age ratings' are included on some children's books for parents but publishers are not under any obligations to do so for adult literature.

But the rapidly-increasing popularity of e-books is generating growing fears that kids can instantly access pornographic adult literature at the click of a button.

Fame: US actress Pamela Anderson was one of the first celebrities to be involved in a leaked sex tape scandal, in 1998, with then-husband Tommy Lee

Jon Brown, head of sexual abuse at the NSPCC, said: 'It is really important to talk to your children about the risks that are out there either online or offline, in an age-appropriate way and without frightening them.

'Speak to them specifically about the risks of making a 'sex tape' and if it did get into the wrong hands, it could go viral online.'

He added: 'We'd also urge you to be interested in what your children are reading and researching online and find out what your children's schools are doing about these issues as part of the curriculum.

'Book retailers on or offline have a responsibility not to sell over 18 material to children and young people under 18.'
