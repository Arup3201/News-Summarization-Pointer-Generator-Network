At the 11th attempt, Roy Hodgson appears to have stumbled upon a specialist right back to solve a nagging England problem.

Not a massive problem, like a shortage of centre backs or total absence of defensive midfielders. There are plenty of Englishmen capable of operating at right back in the Barclays Premier League.

But not all seem quite as comfortable in the job as Nathaniel Clyne did against Slovenia at Wembley.

It is not as if Clyne has been hidden from view. There was interest from Manchester United as he ran down his Crystal Palace contract and left Selhurst Park on a Bosman transfer in the summer of 2012.

The United move did not materialise and he joined newly promoted Southampton. Hodgson has been a regular visitor to St Mary’s, selecting Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Jay Rodriguez and Luke Shaw last season, but did not call up Clyne until every other option had been exhausted.

Kyle Walker’s form suffered, even before his injury. Glen Johnson’s fitness became even less reliable than his defending and Hodgson has been searching for his successor. Centre backs Phil Jones and Chris Smalling have not appeared at ease in the role. John Stones and Calum Chambers are versatile but inexperienced and most likely to develop in other positions.

Clyne, who impressed on his debut, claimed he just tried to play his 'normal game' against Slovenia

Clyne is a natural right back. He is quick and mobile. He gets forward at the right times and recovers well. He is strong, likes to tackle and has positional awareness from learning the role over time.

It was an impressive debut from a man who knew the job being asked of him.

‘I tried to play my normal game, as it’s my normal game that has got me this call-up,’ said Clyne. ‘I felt I did well. I enjoyed playing and I’m looking forward to playing more.’

Hopefully he will. Hodgson considers himself a round-pegs-for-round-holes kind of guy, but it has taken him a long time to come round to Clyne. 

With Gary Neville, perhaps England’s last international-class right back, on his staff, you might think identifying the right man would be easy.

You might think, after working at Fulham and West Brom, Hodgson would readily trust less fashionable clubs but he has rifled through Manchester United centre backs and Liverpool and Arsenal rookies before realising a 23-year-old from Southampton may be the answer.

Glen Johnson has 54 England caps to his name, but failed to convince during the 2014 World Cup
