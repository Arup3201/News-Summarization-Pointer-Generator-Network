She was booted off Dancing on Ice during the first week and now Pamela Anderson is blaming her boobs for her departure.

The Baywatch star, 45, believes she was voted out of the competition because her outfit failed to contain her modesty - a situation she describes as 'common' in her life.

The cosmetically enhanced actress was appearing on this morning when she put her exit down to her chest.Â

Blaming the boobs: Pamela Anderson blamed her exit from Dancing on Ice on suffering a wardrobe malfunction which left her breasts on popping out of her dress

Pamela said: 'I feel so bad for Matt [Evers]. I stumbled, my boobs fell out. It's common in my life.'

She added: 'The wardrobe assistant didn't cross the petals over how she should have done. Maybe it was a conspiracy theory! Kidding.'

'I've done that routine flawlessly but I was only here a few days from LA so I didn't know what was going on.'

What a shame: The 45-year-old actress appeared on This Morning and said: 'I feel so bad for Matt [Evers]. I stumbled, my boobs fell out. It's common in my life.'

Graceful: Pamela had shown promise as a skater, but her mistake during the skate-off cost her a place in the next episode

It seems the embarrassment of bowing 
out of the competition first has left the actress ruling out appearing 
on any reality shows in the future.

Asked
whether she'd do reality TV again, she said: No, I'm never doing this 
again. I don't think I should be in this environment anyway. I don't 
know what I'm doing.'

'Everyone around me tells me not to do it, but I just do what I want.'

It's a conspiracy: Pammie joked that the wardrobe assistant was to blame for not putting the petals over her nipples as she should have done

She's done with reality: Pamela said that she wouldn't do another TV show again, but said she might go to Vegas to do a show next

Pamela added that she may well take up a spot in Sin City next and says she is inundated with request to perform then.

She said: 'Maybe I'll do Vegas next. I'm always being asked to front my own show.'

Pamela was voted off Dancing On Ice on Sunday night after her attempts to amend her neckline on the ice saw the the judges decide to save Keith Chegwin Olga Sharutenko after the couples ended up in bottom two.

Farewell: Pamela Anderson and her partner Matt Evers were the first to be voted off Dancing On Ice

Wardrobe malfunction: Pamela struggled to stay in her dress during the skate-off

Do you think the Dancing On Ice judges were correct to send Pamela Anderson home?

Although she had performed strongly in 
her first dance earlier on Sunday evening, her second dance was ruined by her dress issue.

Fortunately for Pamela, the wardrobe team was prepared and she was wearing matching white and silver nipple covers to protect her modesty when her right breast started to escape from the tight dress.

Pamela's exit was a shock to bookmakers Ladbrokes, who had given her 20/1 odds to be first voted out.

Although she was in the top half of 
the leaderboard and Chegwin was at the bottom, her luck didn't translate
to her second dance.

For
the skate-off, Pamela performed another slow number to Sinead 
O'Connor's cover of Sacrifice, following her earlier skate to Emeli 
Sande's Read All About It.

After
the dance, Pamela admitted she had struggled with her dress, with host 
Philip Schofield joking: 'If that happened earlier, you wouldn't be in 
the skate-off.'

TV 
presenter Chegwin, who was forced to quit last year's show after 
breaking his ribs, performed a new dance to O Fortuna after his earlier 
skate to D:ream's Things Can Only Get Better.

Lacking support: Pamela looked uncomfortable in her tiny dress during the performance

Following the skate-off, it was up to the judges to decide their fate.

Karen Barber said: 'I'd like to save you both, but the best performance that time was Keith.'

Ashley Roberts agreed: 'Because of the stumbles I'm saving Keith.'

Sad: Pamela didn't feel too confident about her chances after stumbling during the routine

Serious stuff: Keith Chegwin and Olga Sharutenko performed a dramatic sequence to O Fortuna

Jason Gardiner's third vote for Pamela meant head judge Robin Cousins' vote was essentially redundant: 'I'm saving Keith.'

Pamela remained philosophical about 
it and apologised to her partner: 'Sad, it was really fun and now I know
how to skate a little bit. I feel so sad, sorry Matt, I stumbled, I 
fell, my boobs fell out.'

Following their first performances earlier that evening, all the celebrity contestants had brand new dances ready for a potential skate-off.

Shayne
Ward and Maria Fillipov were the first to find out they had survived 
another week, followed by Beth Tweddle and Dan Whiston.

Tension: Matt, Pamela, Keith and Olga wait for the judges to decide their fate

Shock: Samia Ghadie and Beth Tweedle react after hearing Pamela is voted off

Matt
Lapinskas and Brianne Delcourt were ecstatic to find out they were 
through, followed by Samia Ghadie and Sylvain Longchambon.

Week one saw only half of the 12 celebrity contestants taking to the ice.

Lauren
Goodger, Oona King, Gareth Thomas, Joe Pasquale, Anthea Turner and Luke
Campbell and their partners will all skate for the first time next 
Sunday.

Sunday's
live show marked the return of former judges Jason and Karen to the 
panel, as well the debut of former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, who 
spent years as a trained dancer before joining the girl group.

'Tentative and a few little stutters': Pamela let her nerves get the better of her during her first performance

Pamela Anderson and Matt Evers: 18.5
