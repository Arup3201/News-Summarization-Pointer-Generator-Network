First, seven-time world bodybuilding champion Arnold Schwarzenegger became the governor of California.

Then 23-year-old Maja Pavlovic, a politician of Serbia's ruling party, won a medal in the European leg of the Women's bodybuilding Contest in Spain.

Now Queensland MP Jason Woodworth has taken to Facebook with a series of pictures of himself flexing and doing bodybuilding poses.

Mr Woodforth is currently competing for pre-selection ahead of the next state election

A member of the ruling National Liberal Party, Mr Woodforth is again seeking pre-selection for the next Queensland election, due next year.

He took to Facebook to take exception to media reports describing him as a 'former' bodybuilder.

'Former Bodybuilder? When did I stop training? Here's pics from June this year,' he posted on Facebook.

'Not that I consider myself a bodybuilder per se, I am simply having a go and being the best that i could be. 

Mr Woodforth, the Australian Vice President and Queensland President of the International Natural Bodybuilding Association, also runs a body building supplement business.

In his post, Mr Woodforth claimed he could be the only bodybuilder who has been elected to parliament.

'I could be the only MP in the world that has ever got onto a BB stage, that might be a first.!' he wrote.

Some readers objected, saying he was certainly not the only politician who became known for pumping iron. 

'Arnie??? Should we forget so soon?' said one, Gary Norman.

'Does Arnold Schwarzenegger count as a MP? He was a politician who got onto a BB stage,' said another, Michael McGuinness.

The post arose after the MP saw media reports referring to him as a 'former bodybuilder'
