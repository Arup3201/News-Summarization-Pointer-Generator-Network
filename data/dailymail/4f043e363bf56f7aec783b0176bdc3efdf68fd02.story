A California trio consisting of a 23-year-old man, a 36-year-old woman and a teenage minor were jailed Friday on suspicion of murdering a man they initially told police was their would-be kidnapper.

Police in Gardena were summoned to the scene of what callers claimed was an attempted kidnapping around 5pm Friday and found a man unconscious in a truck.

The three purported victims—Jennifer Nichols, 36, Alejandro Terrazas, 23, and an unnamed 15-year-old minor—claimed they were able to get away from the man after knocking him out, reports KABC. 

However, police would soon made up their own minds about what had gone down.

The unconscious man, later identified as 34-year-old Bradley Hayes of Hesperia, was taken to an area hospital as resuscitation attempts were made en route.

Those attempts were unsuccessful and Hayes was soon pronounced dead.

A subsequent investigation showed the trio who called police weren't telling authorities all they knew.

According to Gardena Police Lt. Steve Prendergast, all four of them were acquaintances.

Police believe the surviving trio assaulted the man, though their reasons remained unclear, and his injuries proved fatal.

A cause of death had yet to be determined Monday pending the completion of an autopsy.

The suspects, all of whom hail from the city of Hawthorn, all remained detained over the weekend.

Police responded to a call to this truck in Gardena, California on Friday evening. They found 34-year-old Bradley Hayes unconscious. The trio claimed they knocked him out in self-defense but police charged them each with homicide after efforts to revive Hayes were fruitless. Police believe the trio were each acquainted with the man they're accused of killing
