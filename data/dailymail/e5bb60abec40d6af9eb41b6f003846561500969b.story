The bill for the British police investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is set to top £10million.

Madeleine went missing aged three while on holiday with her parents in Portugal in 2007 and has never been found.

David Cameron ordered a review of the case in 2011, which has seen Metropolitan Police detectives travel to Portugal to investigate.

The bill for the new inquiry - which has involved large-scale searches of Portuguese resort Praia da Luz (pictured) - will soon top £10million, figures have revealed

As part of the new investigation, police carried out digs and used sniffer dogs in an area of scrubland not far from where the youngster disappeared in 2007

It emerged today that the cost of the review will soon be more than £10million - around the twice the £5million originally set aside.

A freedom of information request by the Daily Mirror found that police spent £1.9million in the first year of the review, £2.8million in the second year and £2.6million in the third.

With the bill for this year expected to be roughly the same as last year, the overall cost will rise from £7.3million to more than £10million, it was reported.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Home Office remains committed to supporting the search for Madeleine McCann. 

'We have always said we would provide the Metropolitan Police with the resources they need to investigate her disappearance.'

The cost of the investigation emerged after a new Portuguese prosecutor, Ines Sequeira, was brought in and given the job of solving the disappearance.

A source close to investigation said: '[Ms Sequeira] has been appointed as the new prosecutor and the Scotland Yard team has been given renewed hope of being able to start work again in Portugal before the end of the month.

The initial estimated for the Home Office-funded enquiry - called Operation Grange - was around £5million

'Ms Sequeira is one of the sharpest and most ambitious prosecutors in Portugal. She is utterly determined to get a result on the Madeleine inquiry.'

Scotland Yard officers are due to fly to Portugal later this month to re-interview three of seven suspects previously questioned in Faro police stations.

Among them are Jose Carlos Fernandes da Silva, an ex-worker at the Ocean Club resort, Paulo Ribeiro, who looks like a man seen near the apartment, and charity collector Ricardo Rodrigues.

Madeleine McCann vanished from the room she was sharing with her younger twin siblings while her parents were eating dinner in a restaurant in the resort of Praia da Luz in May 2007.

Several men, including a Cape Verde immigrant and heroin addict who died in 2009 following a tractor incident, have been considered as suspects but no one has been charged over the child's disappearance.
