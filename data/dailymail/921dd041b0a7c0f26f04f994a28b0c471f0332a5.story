An Air India pilot faces suspension after ignoring last-minute orders to change flights because she had arranged to pick up her favourite snack along her original route.

Captain Smriti Trehan refused to switch her scheduled Mumbai-Jodhpur-Delhi flight to a later direct flight between Mumbai and Delhi, according to reports.

The pilot wanted to fly via Jodhpur, as she had arranged for the city's famous onion kachoris to be delivered to the airport.

Peckish: Captain Smriti Trehan reportedly refused to switch her scheduled Air India Mumbai-Jodhpur-Delhi flight to a later direct flight between Mumbai and Delhi, as she had planned to stop in Jodhpur to collect food

Trehan, from Delhi, was staying 
at a Mumbai hotel when she was ordered to change flights, according to the Times of India.

Her original flight had been scheduled for 12pm but she was asked to switch to a 2pm flight.

She ignored the orders and turned up to the airport for her original job, informing operators that she did not intend to change her plans.

Her refusal caused chaos among Air India staff as they scrambled to find a replacement pilot, delaying the Mumbai-Delhi flight by an hour.

Sources said that the pyaz kachoris was successfully delivered to Captain Trehan at Jodhpur 
airport and she took off for Delhi without delay.

Senior officials were reportedly made aware of the incident, immediately ordering an inquiry.
