Marine experts were assessing a scene on a Long Island Beach Thursday after a massive whale washed ashore in Suffolk County.

The cetacean was spotted about 7.30am at Smith Point Beach, with a dead turtle also found nearby.

The Riverhead Foundation, a non-profit group based on Long Island that rescues and rehabilitates marine mammals in New York, traveled to the area to investigate, according to PIX11.

The group believe the animal to be a Finback whale - the second largest species of whales in the world - and that it had been dead for some time before showing up on the beach.

Cause of death: A necropsy is expected to be performed on Friday to determine how the whale died

While its exact length has not yet been verified, the whale is said to be between 40 and 50 feet long.

Locals reported seeing a Finback about 30 miles off Jones Beach, about 40 miles south of Smith Point Beach, on Monday.

It is not known whether they are the same whale.

The Riverhead Foundation plan to perform a necropsy on Friday to determine how the animal died.

It may have been hit by a ship, according to ABC. 

The group will also look into the death of the sea turtle, which was identified as a leatherback.
