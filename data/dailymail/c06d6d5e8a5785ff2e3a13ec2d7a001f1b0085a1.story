Madonna's personal trainer, Nicole Winhoffer, has been unveiled as the new face, ambassador and trainer for Adidas by Stella McCartney.

A series of new campaign images shows her demonstrating incredible flexibility, performing a split and bending over backward.

The former dancer, 30, has been working with the Material Girl since 2009, famously replacing Tracy Anderson.

Now that's a stretch: Madonna's personal trainer, Nicole Winhoffer, has been unveiled as the new face, ambassador and trainer for Adidas by Stella McCartney

The new role will see Ms Winhoffer model the designer activewear and create unique training sessions for the brand.

In a press release announcing the news, the trainer said: 'I am honored to be a part of [the Adidas] family. Fitness is art, and together, our marriage of movement, performance, and fashion will create a new standard. The sky is the limit!'

Stella McCartney, too, voiced her enthusiasm for the partnership, stating: ‘It’s really exciting to have an opportunity to work with a woman that lives and breathes every moment of what she does and uses health and fitness in a way that inspires others. I am thrilled that she is joining the Adidas by Stella McCartney family.’

Ms Winhoffer met Madonna when she worked as a trainer on the Sticky & Sweet tour in 2009, and later stepped into the spotlight when the pair collaborated on a series of workout DVDs, Addicted to Sweat, and a global gym chain, Hard Candy Fitness.

But Madonna is not Ms Winhoffer’s only famous personal training client. She also trains the line’s designer, Stella McCartney, who at 43 and a mother-of-four, looks as good in her wares as any catwalk model.

Ms Winhoffer’s celebrity roster also includes Rachel Weisz, Abbie Cornish, Andrea Riseborough and Steven Klein.

The trainer has been credited with Madonna’s lithe figure, a far cry from the muscular physique she displayed while working with Ms Anderson.

The secret, she told E! News back in February, is down to 90 minute workouts, six days a week.

‘I create a new program each week,’ she said. ‘Mondays we learn the new program together. We focus on new muscle groups, new music and planting the programs in our body. Our workouts are challenging, serious and always focusing on shocking the body.'
