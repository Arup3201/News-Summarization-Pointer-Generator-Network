Steven Gerrard called those long, lonely nights out on the left wing under former England manager Fabio Capello the graveyard shift.

Roy Hodgson has the bodies in this squad - five in all - to fill the role, but Danny Welbeck is his go-to man out on England’s left.

Hodgson is spoilt for choice on either flank and he will surely give into temptation when England experiment against Ecuador and Honduras in Miami next week. Raheem Sterling, if anyone, deserves a run.

Ambition: Danny Welbeck wants to compete with Daniel Sturridge and Wayne Rooney for a central role

Wide man: Roy Hodgson prefers to play the Manchester United forward on the left for England

Blow it now and there is a chance that
 you could be at the back of the queue when it comes to the crunch 
against Italy in the opening group game at the World Cup on June 14.

In
 Portugal, during England’s week-long training camp the at swish Vale do
 Lobo resort, Welbeck spoke of his frustrations about life on the left 
flank.

He wanted to compete 
with Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge for a central role in this 
England team, Hodgson prefers him on the left.

It
 is there that he has made his mark with England, weighing in with a 
steady stream of goals during the national team’s successful World Cup 
qualifying campaign.

Daniel 
Sturridge, who scored England’s opener, is immovable. He is England’s 
threat up front and the Liverpool striker is thriving with the 
responsibility of leading the line.

Curler: Sturridge's stunning strike from the top of the box showed the quality he's capable of producing

Welbeck doesn't have that confidence right now, but Hodgson is a loyal man and Welbeck is a willing servant.

This
 has not been an easy season for the Manchester United forward and there
 is a feeling that his career at Old Trafford is coming to a close.

He
 did OK last night, nothing more than that on a night when Hodgson 
wanted to give a decent-sized Wembley crowd a worthy send off before 
they head out to Miami.

Welbeck
 had a couple of decent touches, including a mazy first half run past 
four or five Peru players that should have ended with a free-kick. 

Still, there must have been a temptation for Hodgson to start with 
Sterling, the one man who has been on fire during England’s two weeks 
together. At 18 he plays without fear.

No fear: Raheem Sterling brings a substantial spark to the England line-up when on the pitch

Late change: Sterling came on for Wayne Rooney in the 65th minute in England's 3-0 win over Peru

Sterling has conviction, one of the driving forces behind Liverpool’s thrilling chase for the Barclays Premier League title. He should have started at Wembley.

You
 could make a case for James Milner too after his exceptional 
performances for Manchester City in the final weeks of their 
title-winning season. Milner came on towards the end, but it was a pity
 that he didn’t get a decent chance to shine at the national stadium. 
His chance will come again.

On
 the opposite wing Adam Lallana was neat and tidy in his third 
appearance, but he is still playing his way into this England team. That
 can take time.

Lallana has 
all the ability, the technical touches required to play at the highest 
level. He also looks comfortable on either wing.

If England lack anything then it is those thrilling runs that Sterling can provide with those dancing feet.

His
 pace and those attacking instincts, to send defenders off balance by 
twisting and turning with those electrifying bursts, can be a real 
threat in tournament football.

Sterling’s
 chance came in the 65th minute, adding a touch of glamour to the 
England team at a time when they were 2-0 up and cruising.

There is an invincibility about him, an energy about his game that makes you believe anything can happen when he is on the ball.

On Wednesday, when England play Ecuador in Miami, expect Sterling to get his chance to really bring this team to life.
