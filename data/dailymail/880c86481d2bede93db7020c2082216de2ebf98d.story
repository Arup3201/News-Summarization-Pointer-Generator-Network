Jose Mourinho has hit out at Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher and his fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness following their comments about the behaviour of Chelsea players during the Champions League defeat by Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.

The Chelsea players have been widely criticised for surrounding referee Bjorn Kuipers before Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off for a first-half foul on Oscar.

Speaking of the incident, Carragher told Sky Sports: 'The reaction from the Chelsea players is disgraceful. It’s something that is sad that is coming into the game.

'It comes from I think Jose Mourinho’s teams, they have this reaction, it’s not a one-off.'

Former Liverpool star Souness also branded the actions of Chelsea's squad 'pathetic'.

He said: 'In Jamie’s (Carragher) generation, when someone caught you, the last thing you wanted to show your opponent is that you’re injured, today it’s the exact opposite. 

'If someone brushes you, you want to go down and get them in trouble. That’s how pathetic it is.

'Thank goodness PSG stood up to that and leave here with great credit. They are the proper team.' 

Speaking on Friday, Mourinho responded by suggesting Carragher and Souness have forgotten what it's like to be a player. 

He said: ‘The world is a bit strange, what with the diet and the quality of products we are eating, because memories are getting short.

'When Graeme Souness and Carragher speak about it they are having a problem for sure.

‘The game finished and to close the Champions League chapter, I did that in the tunnel, one by one every one from PSG I shook their hands and told them they deserved it.

‘Jamie stopped two years ago and in two years ago he has forgotten everything. Mr Souness had stopped playing for a long time and he has done that.

‘I was at Benfica a couple of years after him, so I know a lot about him. I prefer to laugh, and I prefer to say that they envy is the biggest tribute to us from people in the shadows.’

'My daughter told me, maybe we have some injuries because we lost and we are sad. I told the doctor I don’t believe. Zero injuries. Everybody wants to play.’
