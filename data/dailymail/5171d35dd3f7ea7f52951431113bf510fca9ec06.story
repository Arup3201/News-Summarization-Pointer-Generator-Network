The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport Leagues in the world and every week, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside.

NEWS-MAKER

LeBron's James return to the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Miami Heat was the big story of the summer but all has not gone to plan so far.

Only three players have more turnovers (46) than LeBron this campaign and the Cavs, who were expected to steamroll the weaker Eastern Conference, only ended a four-game losing streak when they overmatched the Orlando Magic 106-74 on Monday night. Still, James was phenomenal in that game, finishing with 29 points, four rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in what was perhaps Cleveland's best performance of the season to date. 

So far the Cavs' have struggled due to lack of overall depth. The team's 'Big Three' (LeBron, fellow new signing Kevin Love, and Kyrie Irving) were expected to make the Cavs immediate contenders, but, Love and Irving have yet to match the defensive consistency of LeBron's old Miami colleagues Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. This team's potential might be greater than that of the Heat, who won two titles and reached two more NBA finals during James' four-year spell in Florida, but they are still a long way away from looking like potential champions.

GOOD WEEK 

The Golden State Warriors made it six wins on the spin on Tuesday night as they enjoyed a 114-97 win over the Miami Heat. The star of the show was undoubtedly Stephen Curry who continues to illustrate why he is one of the best pure shooters to ever play the game. 

The league's foremost marksmen poured in a season-high 40 points on 12-of-19 shooting (including a silly 8-of-11 from three-point distance) in the victory as the Warriors moved to 11-2 under new coach Steve Kerr.

BAD WEEK

Last week we told you about how the Philadelphia 76ers had lost their first 11 games of the season. Fast forward a week and they STILL haven't won a match. They did lead at half-time of Monday night's game against the Portland Trazil Blazers but fell to a 114-104 loss in the end. 

The Sixers are now 0-15 and in massive danger of setting a record for the worst start in NBA history. The 2009-10 Nets currently hold that questionable honour after beginning the season 0-18. 

'Nobody is rolling over or pointing fingers,' 76ers coach Brett Brown said after the Portland loss. 'This locker room is great. You go home and sleep OK. It wasn't that bad. There were a lot of positives tonight.' God only knows how positive he will be if they actually win a game.

NOBODY GETS KOBE BRYANT ON THE CHEAP 

Another struggling team are the LA Lakers and Kobe Bryant is taking a lot of the heat for signing a two-year, $48.5 million contract extension last season. The NBA has a strict salary cap and some have painted Bryant as selfish and greedy for not taking less so the Lakers could enjoy more financial flexibility moving forward. Kobe is not in the mood for apologising to anybody though. 

When asked what he thought about Dirk Nowitzki giving the Dallas Mavericks a 'hometown discount' when it came to renewing his deal, Kobe said: 'It's the popular thing to do The player takes less, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think it's a big coup for the owners to put players in situations where public perception puts pressure on them to take less money. Because if you don't, then you get criticised for it.' For the record the Mavs are 10-5 and the Lakers are 3-11

AND FINALLY...

His dad, Curtis Jackson (aka 50 Cent), may have made it big in the music industry, but Marquise Jackson has been making some noise on the basketball court. The high school senior produced a 'mixtape' to try and attract the attention of college teams. On the video he shows a versatile skill set. He can handle the ball, knock it down from long range and set his teammates up for open looks. He has also been playing against, and matching, some of the best prospects in the country. Alas his small stature, he is just 5' 9', has stopped big colleges recruiting him, but he could be one growth spurt away from becoming relevant in the sport.
