Since leaving the E4 reality TV show that catapulted her to fame, Millie Manderson has been quietly carving out a career in fashion.

The former Made In Chelsea star and self-confessed 'fashion junkie' is a regular fixture at London Fashion Week and even has her own style blog - and it seems that one high-street store has taken notice.

Dorothy Perkins asked Millie to get on board to choose her favourite pieces from the Christmas collection.

Millie says this piece is perfect for a Christmas market and she'll be wearing it to Winter Wonderland

The 24-year-old’s jewellery edit, which launches on November 7, includes crystal embellishments to create statement collars, cocktail rings, gothic inspired cuffs and drop earrings.

A spokesperson for Dorothy Perkins said: 'Millie has recently been wearing a lot of Dorothy Perkins jewellery which makes her a great choice for the brand. 

'We love how she accessories her outfits and she has such a great eye for real statement pieces.

'It has been great working with Millie on our Christmas collection and we’re delighted that she is such a huge fan of Dorothy Perkins.'

Millie added: 'Dorothy Perkins statement jewellery is amazing quality. I love that the range makes my outfits look interesting.'

Mille says she loves the hints of different colour in this necklace, and it makes a great statement

Millie often wears accessories from the Arcadia store on her style blog, a picture-lead site which keeps fans updated on her daily outfits.

Describing her sense of style in a recent interview, Millie said: 'It's a bit of a mix. One day can be completely different to the next.

'I dress according to how I feel. I think in the last year it's got a little harder rather than really girly. It's probably a bit grungier because I've been hanging out at festivals and stuff.

'I always like to have a slight boho feel as well, lots of floppy hats and gilets and tassels. I love tassels.'

Millie loves the petal shaped jewels and the gun metal colour, which makes the fluffy knit look harder

This necklace looks great over a dress, adding detail to a neckline. 'A lovely look for daytime glam'

Millie says she loves the Gothic look to this necklace and would recommend wearing it over lace

Millie thinks this necklace is perfect for glamming up work wear and looks perfect over a shirt

Are there any beauty trends that you are loving at the moment? I love strong eyebrows... that’s been a trend for a while so to help get that look I have been having regular eye brow waxes just to get the shape and to help them grow. I use to just tweeze them myself and use a really natural brow pencil and a brow brush but I am quite into a natural look brow now. I also love a bold lip. It is a great look for both summer and winter. I particularly loving berry autumn colours and I love coral in the summer.Are there Autumn/Winter makeup trends that you will be experimenting with?I love a really bright lip with no eye makeup and maybe a touch of mascara but a really matte lip is gorgeous. Maybe a bright red or I particularly love orange or I go for a dark berryWhat is your beauty regime?It depends on how much time I have. Every day I spend five minutes doing my routine morning and evening...I cleanse, tone and moisturise with Manuka Doctor and then maybe once or twice a week I will have a really nice indulgent pamper evening. I’ll take some time, put the Manuka Doctor ApiNourish Rejuvenating Face Mask on and a hair mask in and have a bath with a lovely oil. I will also body brush and just really indulge.'Who is your beauty icon?Olivia Palermo always looks fab – she is so groomed and glossy and never over done.
