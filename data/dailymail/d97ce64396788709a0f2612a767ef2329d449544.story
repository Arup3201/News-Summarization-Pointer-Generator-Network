Harry Kane may have taken the impact debut to another level with his goal after 79 seconds but he was not the first new cap to make a quick impression in England colours this season.

In October, Fabian Delph left his mark on the Swiss in more ways than one, adding much-needed .

He was booked less than nine minutes into his first England start as he launched a series of tackles. For a time it was hard to know if his premature end would be via red card or substitution.

The Aston Villa midfielder soon settled, however, and it turned out to be neither. He produced a terrific display in Basle and won his fourth cap against Lithuania on Friday.

He has also cleaned up his disciplinary record to help his international career and, after collecting 20 in two years, has just one yellow and one red in 26 appearances this season for club and country.

‘You’ve got to be more careful,’ said Delph. ‘I like to tackle and I’ve managed to curb it this season. I got the yellow against Switzerland and then the red against Sunderland but other than that I’ve been pretty clean. I’m usually on about nine or 10 bookings at this stage!

‘It’s hard to lunge into tackles in international football. If you lunge in on a top-class international footballer they just skip round you or you bring them down. I tried to set a target. I’ve been able to do that so I’m quite proud.’

Even so, his natural aggression lifted England in Switzerland, where a 2-0 win restored some of the confidence lost at the World Cup.

‘I remember lining up a few tackles and getting them wrong, but it didn’t faze me,’ said Delph. ‘It was one of those things. I tried to impose myself early on and mistimed it. After that it was just about trying to stay on my feet, trying to get through the game, trying to perform well, with good energy, keep the ball moving and I managed to do that.’

Dennis Wise can testify to this fondness for physical combat having been cut down by a teenage Delph during one of the regular games between the Leeds staff and youth team. Wise, manager at Elland Road at the time, liked his style and picked him for the first team before he was 18.

‘Those games did get quite tasty,’ said Delph. ‘I did tackle him and he tackled me back. They tended to get quite heated. He gave me my debut. I’m so grateful to Dennis. And Gus Poyet, his assistant. Gus could kick a few people as well.’ This breakthrough rewarded years of commitment from Delph and his mother Donna, who would hop on various buses and trains together to get to academy training sessions.

‘It’s funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training,’ he said. ‘At one point, it would take three buses and one train. But it’s worked out well. I’ve always been pushed hard to succeed. To get those buses, it was nothing.’ As soon as he was able, he bought his mother a house. ‘She’s my hero,’ said Delph. ‘We didn’t have a car, so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me. She was just a great Mum and a great role model.’

Determination is a recurring theme for Delph, who swapped hometown Bradford for Leeds at the age of 11 and then joined Villa for £6million in 2009, only to be hit by serious knee injuries.

‘I ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament, had bad medial ligament damage and tore my lateral meniscus and (knee surgeon) Andy Williams managed to save that,’ said Delph.

‘I got back quite quickly and then broke down four times. I did my medial again on the other knee and then the knees were done and it was my ankles; the left ankle, the right ankle a few times. It was a rollercoaster ride. It made me stronger. It made me realise how much it takes to play at a high level and physically be strong. I worked really hard in the gym.

‘I was confident of coming out the other end but there were always questions. Is he going to get back to his best? Is he going to be the same player?’

As it turned out, he did get back, won his place back in the Villa team and took his England opportunity in the absence of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard.

He missed two months with a shoulder injury soon after breaking into Hodgson’s team but bounced back again, signing a new deal which ties him to Villa Park until 2019.

At 25, Delph is a regular in the England midfield. He is still making an impression, five months after his explosive full debut, and he has the cards under control.
