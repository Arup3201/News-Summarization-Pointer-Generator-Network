Warning: Lord Judge, the former Lord Chief Justice, has warned the European Court has too much power

Over-mighty European judges are undermining the power of Parliament to make laws, one of Britain’s most senior judges has warned.

Lord Judge, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales until September, delivered an unequivocal message on the actions of the Court of Human Rights: ‘Stop here.’

His remarks will give encouragement to Tory Ministers seeking to rein in abuse of human rights laws by criminals, terror suspects and illegal immigrants.

They come as the President of the European court, Judge Dean Spielmann warned Britain's ban on prisoner voting is a breach of international law.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister David Cameron called for the court's powers to be restricted.

He said Britain 'damned well shouldn't' be forced by European 
judges to give prisoners the vote if Parliament decides they should be 
barred from elections.

Judge Spielmann warned any attempt by Britain to pull away from the European Convention on Human Rights could set the UK on a path to leaving the EU altogether.

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Lord Judge, said: 'The
 most fundamental principle of our unwritten constitution is 
parliamentary sovereignty.

'Our
 elected representatives have ultimate sovereignty not only over our own
 unelected judges but in my view over the unelected judges of any other 
jurisdiction, including Europe, unless we choose to give them 
sovereignty.

'My very strong belief is that this issue now needs to be resolved by Parliament,' he said.

'This is a court which is not answerable to anybody,' he added. 'If it's right, it can't be overruled by anybody.

'I genuinely don't think that a body of judges - however distinguished - should have that sort of power.'

Lord Judge, who declared himself a 
supporter of the European Convention on Human Rights, said the court's 
claims have implications for every EU nation, not just the UK.

He said: 'His (Judge Spielmann's) view means 
that the court in Europe is entitled to tell every country in Europe how
 it should organise itself.

'He
 refers to it as a living instrument. Of course the convention isn't a 
dead instrument, but it means that legislation can be made by judges on 
all sorts of societal issues - binding legislation - and if that's the 
position there is a very serious problem with sovereignty.

'It's not a UK problem, the sovereignty issue affects every single country in Europe.'

He added: 'It is time for us to recognise that it is a very important time. My own view is: stop here.'

Judge Spielmann, however, insisted that the UK should not defy the court's ruling on prisoner voting rights.

'This would be clearly inconsistent with the international law obligations of the United Kingdom and also the obligations under the convention,' he told the Today programme.

He said that if Britain sought to pull out of the convention - as some Tory MPs are demanding - it would mean leaving the Council of Europe, the body which created the European Court of Human Rights, and ultimately the EU.

'I cannot see how the United Kingdom could remain a member of the Council of Europe while at the same time withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights,' he said.

Prime Minister David Cameron said there is no chance of prisoners getting the vote during this Government

'All the members of the European Union are also members of the Council of Europe. I can hardly see how a member of the European Union could withdraw from the Council of Europe. I see a problem there.

'I think from a political perspective it might be very difficult to stay in the European Union.'

In a strongly-worded attack on interference from Strasbourg, Mr Cameron called for the European Court of Human Rights to have its wings clipped earlier this month.

The defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the Britain's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights.

In February last year the Commons called 
for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to
 22, despite repeated warnings from Strasbourg.

Mr Cameron said: 'If Parliament decides that prisoners should not get the vote then I think they damn well shouldn't.'

He added: 'It should be a national decision taken in our Parliament.'

The PM said the court's powers must be restricted, telling workers 'we need to clip its wings'.

The prisoner voting row has been 
running since 2005, when Strasbourg judges ordered Britain to give the 
vote to convicted prisoners, who have historically been considered to 
have removed themselves from the electorate.

Despite
 overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the Commons, the
 European judges have continued to repeat their instructions.

In 2010 Mr Cameron said it makes him 'physically ill' to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison.

And
 in October last year he added: 'No one should be under any doubt - 
prisoners are not getting  the vote under this government.'
