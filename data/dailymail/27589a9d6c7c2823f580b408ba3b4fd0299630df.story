Most people with a criminal mind-set would do their utmost to break out of a police station, however, not all see it that way.

Michael Naughton, 24, was caught doing quite the opposite when he was arrested for allegedly attempting to break in to a police station.

Mr Naughton was seen ‘violently pulling’ a locked door at a downtown Boston Police station at 2.30 in the morning.

Naughton, from Somerville, Boston, was discovered as he made his way through the garage door.

He then entered a secured area inside the District A-1 station on Tuesday morning and confronted several police officers.

According to officers, Naughton became ‘belligerent and yelled at the officers to get out of his house,’ CBS Boston reported.

Despite being informed several times that he was inside a police station, Mr Naughton kept shouting his address and argued with the officers.

Police officers were forced to handcuff him after a short struggle after which he was placed in custody.

He was arrested and eventually charged with breaking and entering in the nighttime and resisting arrest.

A court appearance date has yet to be announced.

The act is up there with Zachary Tentoni, 26, of Connecticut who was arrested in July last year in connection with a wallet snatching after he dropped his ID as he was fleeing from the crime scene.

He is narrowly beaten by Michael Marquez, 34, who, while waiting to be questioned on suspicion of shoplifting, reached up and pinched a clock off the wall at a police station in Panama City, Florida.
