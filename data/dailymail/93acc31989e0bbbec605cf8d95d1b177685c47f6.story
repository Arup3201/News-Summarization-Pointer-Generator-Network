They're designed to sell us things and direct our attention to a product or service – but that doesn't mean advertisements can't be done so well that they remain with us. 

A list of the top ten Australian ads released in 2014, have been picked out by AdNews as the year comes to a close.

Amongst them are videos that make you laugh, videos that tug at your heart strings and videos that send a hand straight to your mouth with the intention of shocking us into action.

Old Spice's commercial for male hygiene products, which features Youtube sensation group Bondi Hipsters, was one of the top ten ads of 2014 listed by AdNews

Bundaberg Rum's humorous jingle Men Like US also made it into the top ten list, featuring a group of men who 'like their steak bloody raw inside', fail to launch a boat and declare 'well at least we tried'

One of the videos listed by the website was Old Spice's viral commercial, released in August, in which Youtube sensation group Bondi Hipsters feature to promote the company's male hygiene products.

The ad, in which famous duo Dom and Adrian tell one of their mothers they'll be moving out of home while jesting that Old Spice's products make their 'beard grow quicker' and their 'chest hair thicker', has had over two million views on Youtube.

In the theme of masculinity, Bundaberg Rum's humorous jingle Men Like US also made it into the top ten list, featuring a group of men who 'like their steak bloody raw inside', fail to launch a boat and declare 'well at least we tried'.

St John Ambulance's advertisement, which urges viewers to learn first aid, was amongst one of the more memorable advertisements listed by AdNews.

Another moving video to make the list was created by the Cancer Council of NSW, which encourages women to check themselves regularly in order to detect breast cancer early

The dramatic, spine-tingling video of a mother desperately trying to save her son in a scenario that could very easily occur at any Australian home, certainty gets its message across to viewers.

Another moving video to make the list was created by the Cancer Council of NSW to encourage women to check themselves regularly in order to detect breast cancer early.

Featuring a number of Australian singers that appear topless, the video is also a tribute to Divinyls singer Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer in 2013.

Two other humorous advertisements also made the cut, including Aldi's 'dazzling' Gabrielle who obviously adores his hair and shampoo, and Toyota's amusing trailer for their HiLux.

Gaining over 400,000 views on Youtube, Toyota's video won a spot for its giggle-inducing footage of men who fail to prove they are 'unbreakable' throughout vigorous testing – which of course includes consuming oven-hot meat pies and crossing burning coals barefoot, which emulates a beach car park on a summer day.

Both Origin Australia's curious Energy Made Fresh Daily and Qantas' Feels Like Home were mentioned in the list for their positive commercials, with the former video changing the perspective energy is viewed from, while Qantas appealed to its viewers with nostalgic imagery.

Mention of GE Healthcare's short film Miracle Twins, about the first few months of life for identical twins Ethan and Noah, was also made due to it taking a different approach to advertising by praising the work of hospital staff and delivering a heart-warming case study.

Finally, AdNews also praised Coca-Cola's Colour Your Summer ads, dubbing the marketing campaign that saw the release of different coloured cans as 'smart' and 'refreshing'.
