An ancient mosaic showing a menagerie of animals from birds to leopards, has been unearthed in southern Israel.

The intricate artwork was found when a 1,500-year-old Byzantine church was excavated and has Greek symbols, which archaeologists say shows that it once served as a centre of Christian worship.

The church ruins were discovered during excavations ahead of an infrastructure project in Aluma, some 30 miles (50km) south of Tel Aviv, Israel.

An ancient mosaic showing a menagerie of animals from birds (pictured) to leopards, has been unearthed in southern Israel in a town near Tel Aviv

Archaeologists believe the church was an important part of a Byzantine settlement, which lay on the main road running between Jerusalem and the ancient sea port of Ashkelon.

‘The church probably served as a centre of Christian worship for neighbouring communities,’ they said.

Experts from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) discovered marble pillars and the mosaic floor inside the basilica, which measures 72ft by 39ft (22 by 12metres).

Daniel Varga, director of the IAA's excavations, said: The ‘fine mosaic floor decorated with coloured geometric designs’ lies in the entrance of the church and there is a ‘twelve-row dedicatory inscription in Greek containing the names Mary and Jesus, and the name of the person who funded the mosaic's construction.’

The mosaics in what would have been the church’s nave are decorated with vines in the shape of 40 medallions, which each show a different animal, including a zebra, leopard, wild boar, turtle and winged birds as well as botanical and geometric designs.

There are also Greek inscriptions that mention two local leaders of the church, Demetrios and Herakles.

On both sides of the central nave there are two narrow halls or side aisles, which also have coloured mosaic floors depicting botanical and geometric designs, as well as Christian symbols.

A pottery workshop, mainly for the production of jars, was also uncovered during the excavations and yielded numerous finds, including, amphorae, cooking pots, bowls and different types of oil lamps.

Glass vessels typical of the Byzantine period were also discovered at the site, and indicate a rich and flourishing local culture, archaeologists said.

t has been decided that the site (pictured) will be covered over to preserve it for future generations and the mosaic will be removed, conserved and displayed locally

Excavations by the IAA along the same road have revealed other communities from the same period, but no churches have been found until now.

It is thought people living in the area some 1,500 years ago made a living by making wine and exporting it west to the coast so it could be sold in the wider Mediterranean area.

It has been decided that the site will be covered over to preserve it for future generations and the mosaic will be removed, conserved and displayed locally.

Jewish men who study in a nearby 'yeshiva' or religious seminary, pass by the large Byzantine era church that archaeologists have uncovered.
