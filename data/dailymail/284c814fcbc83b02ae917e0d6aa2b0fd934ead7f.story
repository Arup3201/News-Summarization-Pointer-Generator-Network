Instead of switching off the TV, parents may just need to switch the channel their kids are watching if they want to see improved behavior.

A study at the Seattle Children's Research Institute has found that parents who switched their kids' television from the violent stuff to more educational programming can improve preschoolers' behavior.

More or less: Joe Jensen was part of a Seattle study that wanted to know if changing, not reducing, TV habits could improve kids' behavior

The modest but promising results may lead to ways to avoid aggressive and violent behavior in young children.

'It's not just about turning off the television. It's about changing the channel' said lead author Dr. Dimitri Christakis, a pediatrician and researcher involved in the study.

The research was to be published online Monday by the journal Pediatrics.

The study involved 565 Seattle parents, who periodically filled out TV-watching diaries and questionnaires measuring their child's behavior.

Half were coached for six months on getting their 3-to-5-year-old kids to watch shows like 'Sesame Street' and 'Dora the Explorer' rather than more violent programs like 'Power Rangers.'

The results were compared with kids whose parents who got advice on healthy eating instead.

At six months, children in both groups showed improved behavior, but there was a little bit more improvement in the group that was coached on their TV watching.

Too soon: The study's findings were modest but may pave the way toward curbing aggressive behavior in children

By one year, there was no meaningful difference between the two groups overall. Low-income boys appeared to get the most short-term benefit.

'That's important because they are at the greatest risk, both for being perpetrators of aggression in real life, but also being victims of aggression,' Christakis said.

But the study has some flaws.

The parents weren't told the purpose of the study, but authors concede they probably figured it out and that might have affected the results.

Before the study, the children averaged about 1½ hours of TV, video and computer game watching a day, with violent content making up about a quarter of that time.

By the end of the study, that increased by up to 10 minutes.

Those in the TV coaching group increased their time with positive shows; the healthy eating group watched more violent TV.

Nancy Jensen, who took part with her now 6-year-old daughter, said the study was a wake-up call.

'I didn't realize how much Elizabeth was watching and how much she was watching on her own,' she said.

Baby steps: Researchers admit the study had flaws but some say its a smarter alternative to research that seeks to demonize nearly all TV

Jensen said her daughter's behavior improved after making changes, and she continues to control what Elizabeth and her 2-year-old brother, Joe, watch.

She also decided to replace most of Elizabeth's TV time with games, art and outdoor fun.

During a recent visit to their Seattle home, the children seemed more interested in playing with blocks and running around outside than watching TV.

Dr. Michael Rich, director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Children's Hospital Boston, was not involved in this study but works on similar research and commended the Seattle team's efforts.

'Because no one's going to stop watching TV, we have to have viable alternatives for kids.'
