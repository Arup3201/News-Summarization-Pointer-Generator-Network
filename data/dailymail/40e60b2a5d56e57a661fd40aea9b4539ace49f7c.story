Seven games in, and into the international break, let’s assess who’s been the best player so far in the Premier League.

Diego Costa? Not for me. My vote goes to Angel di Maria.

Of course Costa has been brilliant. But he walked into a team that should have won the title last season – check out those dropped points late in the campaign against Norwich, Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. He has arrived to find a calm environment, a club without turmoil, and not in a situation of seeing a great empire virtually ruined by one stinking, disastrous season.

Angel di Maria has been the standout performer in the Premier League so far this season

Manchester United's £60million signed has contributed goals and assists so far for Louis van Gaal

Costa’s great start is put into shade by what Di Maria has done at Manchester United, where he walked into a huge challenge.

If Di Maria keeps up his form for United and takes them back into the Champions League, surely that is a far bigger achievement than anything any player might do at Chelsea this season?

Let’s put it into context: Manchester United were a shambles last season. After the glory of the Fergie era, some of those players were on the floor under David Moyes. When Rio Ferdinand, with his record of success and medals, says Moyes had him “doubting everything” you can appreciate how low things had sunk at Old Trafford. It was so bad Nemanja Vidic fixed up a move and announced it mid-season – when did a top player do that at United?

With senior players disillusioned, United were heading in totally the wrong direction. They finished seventh and won nothing.

Then three members of the back four left - Ferdinand, Vidic and Patrice Evra. Three senior players.

On top of that the new manager couldn’t start work until the Netherlands were out of the World Cup.

Throw in an injury crisis as the season got under way and you’ll understand the gravity of the situation at Manchester United.

Of course they’ve spent money – they needed to given how awful last season was. But in the context of everything I’ve just described, Louis van Gaal deserves some credit.

The most expensive signing has been Di Maria. Big money players need to make a big impact – United needed that instantly from the Argentina wide man. And they got it.

Some mega-money Premier League players have struggled to have an impact - Robinho and Juan Mata are two examples.

And then we get to the deals that make Di Maria look like a bargain at £60million.

Andy Carroll, Mesut Ozil and Fernando Torres have commanded fees at Premier League clubs that are eye-wateringly embarrassing for all involved.

Cesc Fabregas has hit the ground running since moving to Chelsea from Barcelona in the summer 

Andy Carroll cost West Ham United £15million when the striker signed from Liverpool

Mesut Ozil is still trying to get over leaving Real Madrid this time last year for £42million

Carroll - £35m of injuries. Ozil - £42m to be a lazy lightweight who is struggling to deal with Real Madrid rejection. Torres – a staggering £50m to miss sitters.

Di Maria has been brilliant. He’s been a joy to watch and effective as well.

If all you do is give Player of the Year to the top scorer or one of the champions, then Costa or Fabregas will walk it. But Di Maria is leading the United reconstruction. He’s walked into a total mess at Old Trafford. But he has hit the ground running, and led United back into the top four with some first class performances.

Spanish striker Fernando Torres - now playing for AC Milan - cost Chelsea £50million 

When United players were reportedly furious with van Gaal for taking Di Maria off at Leicester, then it’s clear the impact this player is having.

At £60m he’s expected to instantly provide consistent quality to fulfill the expectations at Manchester United. He doesn’t have the security of a good defence behind him either.

Costa has walked into an already very good Chelsea side. Di Maria arrived to find a big mess needed clearing up.

He’s got stuck in, got his hands dirty and started the clean-up operation. The fact that Di Maria is adding some polish with some sparkling performances is a bonus for United.
