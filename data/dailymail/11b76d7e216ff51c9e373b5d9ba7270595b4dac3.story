Being told off at kindergarten for his Michigan University T-Shirt has led this little boy to become the team’s hero.

Cooper Barton, 5, has been invited to appear in front of thousands of fans at a football match after he made headlines this week when told to turn his ‘Big House’ T-Shirt inside out because strict rules forbid him from wearing clothes from any universities outside Oklahoma, the state he lives in.

A teacher told Cooper he was violating the Oklahoma City Public Schools’ clothing policy but his mother, Shannon Barton, decided to challenge the rules, contacting the school and media.

She told KWTV: 'They should really worry about academics. It wasn't offensive. He's five.'

On ABC News she said: ‘I was angry my son felt a little embarrassed.

‘He didn’t understand why he had to turn his shirt inside-out.

‘Our point was why do you allow one and not the other? Every day kids are wearing (Oklahoma City) Thunder shirts and no one ever makes them turn their shirt.

The mission was championed by Michigan fans prompting the university’s athletic director David Brandon to invite Cooper and his family to the September 15 game at the 'big house', the very stadium Cooper's T-Shirt displayed in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

Mr Brandon also offered to introduce the boy to the crowd at half time.

A new, improved T-Shirt was also made for Cooper that, even when turned inside out, still displays the university logo.

Mrs Barton and her husband plan to attend a school board meeting on September 10 to fight what she sees as a double standard.

She said: ‘What’s good for one should be good for all. 

‘This is a military town, with Chesapeake Energy, the hospital. Not everybody is from Oklahoma so they should be allowed to wear what they like.’

Given the media attention, school district officials have said that they are re-evaluating the clothing ban which has been in place for seven years.

The rule was put in place to combat fears that American gangs used popular sports clothing to represent specific gangs.

The school district’s superintendent Karl Springer said in a statement: ‘In cooperation with the Oklahoma City Police Department Gang Task Force, the policy was approved in 2005 after concerns that nationwide gangs used popular sports clothing to represent individual gangs.

‘As when any policy is questioned; OKCPS administration will review the policy to determine if changes need to be made.’

When asked if Cooper might end up attending Michigan University, Mrs Barton joked: ‘I don’t think he has a choice.
