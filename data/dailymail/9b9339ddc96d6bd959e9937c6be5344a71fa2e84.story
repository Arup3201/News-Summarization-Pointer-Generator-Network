While all eyes were on the iPad mini launch launch night, Microsoft tried to steal Apple's thunder by allowing the first reviews of its supposed iPad killer, called Surface, to be published.

However, the tactic may have backfired.

The Surface tablet, which will cost between £399 and £559 ($499 to $699 in the US) when it goes on sale on Thursday, was met with a lukewarm response, with reviewers criticising its lack of apps and branding it 'a compromise'.

US journalists have published the first reviews of Microsoft's Surface tablet - and slammed it as 'disappointing', blaming a lack of apps.

The Surface is Microsoft's first foray into computer hardware.

Based on a Nvidia Corp chip designed by ARM 
Holdings, the Surface will run a simplified version of Windows 8 that is
not compatible with old Microsoft applications.

However,
the tablet will feature new app-style versions of Office mainstays such
as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and will include Xbox games, video and 
music apps.

The Surface, with two cameras and a USB port, will be Wi-Fi only.

Even the most positive review, from technology magazine Wired, would only go so far as describing the tablet as 'quite good'.

The price is the same as the cheapest iPad, and will put the two firms into a head to head battle.

Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus tablet are also set to be launched or receive updates this week as manufacturers prepare for what many predict will be a 'tablet Christmas'.

The Surface will go on sale the same day Microsoft releases Windows 8, 
the new version of its desktop computer software.

Experts have described the software as make or break for the company, but say the Surface will struggle against the iPad.

'It is priced the same as the iPad , even though the Surface has a higher spec with 32gb rather than the iPad's 16gb,' said Stuart Miles of gadget website Pocket Lint.

'However, the consumer is unlikely to understand that - they will simple see that it's a straight choice between an iPad and Surface, and I think the majority of people will choose an iPad - they just won't be aware of a spec fight.

Mr Miles said the tablet could appeal to owners of Microsoft powered mobile phones.

'If you've used Windows Phone the Surface is easier to use, but not many people have - and people love or hate it.'

'We hadn't looked forward to something this much in a long, long time.

'Now it's here: And it's been just as long a time since a gadget has been so disappointing. Should you buy it? No.'

The Verge: 'Not Quite There - And The Clock Is Ticking' (7/10)'The
promise of the Surface was that it could deliver a best-in-class tablet
experience, but then transform into the PC you needed when heavier 
lifting was required.

'Instead of putting down my tablet and picking up 
my laptop, I would just snap on my keyboard and get my work done.

'But 
that's not what the Surface offers, at least not in my experience.

'It 
does the job of a tablet and the job of a laptop half as well as other 
devices on the market, and it often makes that job harder, not easier.

'Instead of being a no-compromise device, it often feels like a 
more-compromise one.'

Engadget: 'Where are the apps?' (No score)'It needs a bigger pile of apps and games to make up for that and, while we're sure they're coming, we don't know when.

'If
gaming and music and movies and reading are what you're looking to 
enjoy, then we might advise sitting this one out for a few months just 
to make sure that all your bases will indeed be covered.

'If,
however, you're looking for an impeccably engineered tablet upon which 
you can do some serious work, a device that doesn't look, feel or act 
like a toy, then you should get yourself a Surface with Windows RT.'

Wired: 'Microsoft Has Surfaced A Hit' (8/10)'This is a great device.

'It
is a new thing, in a new space, and likely to confuse many of 
Microsoft’s longtime customers. People will have problems with 
applications — especially when they encounter them online and are given 
an option by Internet Explorer to run them, only to discover this won’t 
work.

'But overall it’s quite good; certainly better than any full-size Android tablet on the market.'

New York TImes: 'Sleek Tablet, Clumsy Software' (No Score)'What lets the Surface down is supposedly Microsoft’s specialty: 
software."

Wall Street Journal: 'Hardworking Tablet With PC Chops''Microsoft's
Surface is a tablet with some pluses: the major Office apps and nice, 
optional keyboards.

'If you can live with its tiny number of third-party 
apps, and somewhat disappointing battery life, it may give you the 
productivity some miss in other tablets.'
