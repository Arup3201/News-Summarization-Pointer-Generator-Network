Authorities say a New Jersey man awoke after a long night's sleep to discover a knife stuck in his back.

Police in Trenton say the 42-year-old man didn't know why his back was hurting when he got up Sunday so he had his brother take a look.

The brother discovered a knife protruding from the middle of the man's back.

Police did not identify the man.

The stabbing occured around 2am Sunday after the victim had been drinking.

The Times of Trenton reports that he stepped out onto his front porch on the 600 block of North Clinton Ave to smoke a cigarette.

While there, a man approached the man and asked for a light.

The victim refused and the pair got into a physical fight.

When the victim began to gain the upper hand, the other man ran away and the victim decided not to pursue him.Â 

Police did not disclose the size or 
type of knife, but told the Times of Trenton that a five-inch blade was 
removed from the victim's back at Capital Health Regional Medical 
Center.

A
 detailed description of the man believed to have stabbed the victim is 
unavailable, as the victim was reportedly 'very uncooperative.'

The victim is expected to be released from hospital today.

Police are asking that anyone with information about the incident call Trenton police.
