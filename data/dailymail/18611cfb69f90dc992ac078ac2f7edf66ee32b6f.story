George Osborne was always facing a difficult balancing act between sticking with the austerity drive and giving the economy a boost

Humiliating? Certainly. Having made so much of Britain’s AAA credit rating as a magnificent statement of confidence in his economic policies, Chancellor George Osborne has been given a political bloody nose by Moody’s downgrade.

Polls
 indicate the Tories leading in the run-up to the Eastleigh  by-election
 but the new rating can serve to be only a setback  as voters reconsider
 Osborne’s attempts to cut the deficit.

The
 loss of our AAA credit rating had been widely expected and we would do 
better not to place much emphasis on minor tweaks by agencies – after 
all, they are still somewhat tarnished by their failings during the 
financial crash.

Osborne 
was always facing a balancing act in next month’s Budget between 
sticking to his austerity drive to retain our rating and giving the 
economy a boost to generate the growth that is needed if we are ever 
going to pay down our debts.

While
 businessmen have stressed their desire for the Chancellor to keep a 
tight rein, they have become increasingly frustrated that there have 
been no imaginative initiatives to kick-start growth.

Companies
 in this country have about £180 billion in cash on their books and have
 been looking to the Chancellor to come up with a gesture to encourage 
them to start spending this money to create orders and jobs.

The
 fact that the pound fell suggests most economists were taken by 
surprise by the timing of Moody’s downgrade – most had thought such a 
move unlikely before the autumn.

Thinking in the City is mixed this weekend on whether the downgrade will put more than temporary pressure on sterling.

However,
 if the pound falls more that could create an inflationary pressure that
 the Bank of England is unlikely to want to stave off with higher 
interests rates because of the damage that would inflict on the wider 
economy.

The pound is 
already seven per cent down from the start of the year, which will make 
our imports more expensive. That will be uncomfortable for shoppers who 
are already experiencing a squeeze on the purchasing power of the pound 
in their pocket.

The incoming Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has indicated he is prepared to tolerate inflation if that is the price for growth

The Bank of England has already
 said that inflation will top three per cent during the summer but the 
betting must be on three per cent looking rather moderate longer term.

Incoming
 Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has already indicated he is 
prepared to tolerate a dose of inflation if that is the price necessary 
for growth.

Conversely, 
though, it would be good news for our exporters who have, recently, been
 showing themselves more inclined to pass on the benefits of the weaker 
pound in terms of lower prices for their overseas customers rather than 
keeping prices level and pocketing a larger profit.

The
 Treasury’s own worst-case scenario is that we could have to pay an 
extra £20 billion a year in interest payments because of our slightly 
diminished credit ranking. However, America was actually able to borrow 
more cheaply after it was downgraded.

And, don’t forget, investors have to put their money somewhere.

Only Germany and Canada still have AAA-rated economies – and arguably even Germany could be under pressure.

Unlike
 us it does not control its own currency and therefore lacks the 
flexibility that manipulating the exchange rate can give. Its recent 
economic performance has also been weak.

Britain’s economic ranking may have lost some of its lustre but it is in good company: ratings are not absolutes.
