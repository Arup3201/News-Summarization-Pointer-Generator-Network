Most families who order a turkey for Christmas expect to pick it up. Lyn Hughes, however, had a shock when one turned up outside her door – of his own free will.

Fortunately for the bird, which had escaped from a nearby farm in Worcester, Mrs Hughes, 62, already had one of his friends in her freezer and had no need for additional dinner table fare.

Instead she simply took some photographs to record the moment.

A great escape: This turkey escaped a local farm before being spotted by residents running around a suburban neighbourhood in Worcester

Plucky bird: Lyn Hughes discovered the turkey hiding behind shrubs on her driveway on Chelmsford Drive

Yesterday, Mrs Hughes told how a young boy called at her home on Chelmsford Drive to ask 'have you seen a turkey walking around the estate?'

She initially dismissed the door-knock as a prank and shut the door - but when she saw the worried lad still outside she went out to investigate.

Retired Mrs Hughes said: 'I asked him where the turkey was and he said it was hiding behind a bush. He then took me to where it was.

'All I could see was these black feathers and all of a sudden he reared up and emerged from the bush.

A new home: The RSPCA managed to capture the bird - which has since been nicknamed Tommy the Turkey - and take him to a local bird sanctuary

'Imagine the shock when he ran out in front of me and started strutting around.

'The young lad had stayed out there for hours with the bird while he waited for someone to come out.

Mysterious: A spokesperson for the RSPCA said it's unlikely they will ever know where the bird came from

'He was clearly upset at the thought of the turkey being out all night and worried a fox would probably get it.

'At one point he even tried to catch it and put it in his own garden.

'I told him he had done everything he possibly could for the turkey and that he deserved a medal for his efforts.

'I had my own turkey already so when it walked up the drive I thought "oh no, I’ve got one of his mates in the freezer".'

The RSPCA were called to the street on November 28 and managed to catch Tommy before taking him to a nearby animal sanctuary.

A charity spokesperson said the bird had been taken to the vet and checked over but they did not know where it came from.

She said: 'We were asked to come and retrieve a black male turkey after a member of the public had corralled him in to a garden.

'An inspector and and animal collection agent arrived and took the bird to an animal rescue centre nearby.

'At this time of year a lot of people who wouldn’t normally do so farm turkeys on an ad-hoc basis.

'Perhaps a local farmer had been keeping them in a spare field and this one managed to escape.

'If their wings aren’t clipped properly they can easily get over a fence and make a run for it.

'So it’s likely that it’s a farm turkey but we won’t ever know for certain.'
