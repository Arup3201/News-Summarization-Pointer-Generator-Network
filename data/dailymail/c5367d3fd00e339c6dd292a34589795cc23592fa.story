Mark Harrison, 49, had an affair with a 14-year-old girl after wooing her via text and on Facebook

A maths teacher who had an affair with a 14-year-old schoolgirl after wooing her by text and on Facebook was jailed for two and a half years today.

Mark Harrison, 49, swapped up to 100 texts a day with the girl after she developed a crush on him.

He sent her pictures of himself aroused and texted her saying he wished she was sharing a bed with him.

He also told her how much he was looking forward to her turning 16 so they could legally have sex and said she was not like any ‘other girl’.

The pair eventually engaged in oral sex during two sexual liaisons at the home in Whitefield, Manchester, he shared with his mother. His mother was away at the time.

But the girl - described as ‘highly intelligent and articulate’ - was said to have been left ‘very shaken and angry’ by her experiences and told a member of staff at her school.

She later told police: ‘He talked me into everything and he assumed I wanted everything he wanted and in the end that's what I thought I wanted.’

The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, has since been treated for depression and has been referred to a counsellor after trying to self-harm.

At Bolton Crown Court Harrison pleaded guilty to grooming a child for sexual activity and four counts of sexual activity with a child.

The hearing was told the incidents occurred after Harrison took early retirement from St Monica's High School in Prestwich where he had worked for 17 years.

He visited the school voluntarily afterwards and later met the girl. In March this year she sent him a friend request on Facebook and he accepted.

‘She developed a crush on Harrison,’ said Richard Orme, prosecuting. ‘She thought he was attractive and when he paid her attention she felt flattered and started to like him even more.

‘The two began regular contact on Facebook, messaging each other a couple of times a day and this soon became much more frequent and Harrison then asked that they continue their conversations on their mobile phones.

‘All communication has been via text - approximately 100 per day - never any verbal calls for fear of getting caught.

'These texts would be throughout the day, starting from very early in the morning to very late at night, leaving the girl very tired at school.’

On April 1 Harrison was at a wedding of a former work colleague when he texted the girl saying he wished that ‘she was there sharing a bed with him’.

Mr Orme added: ‘She said that this was the first time that Harrison said anything to her which was of a sexual nature and she was freaked out by this at first and didn't know what to say but then just went along with it.

‘Harrison started telling the girl what he wanted to do to her sexually. He sent messages stating that he couldn't wait till she was 16 then it would be legal. Things developed gradually and Harrison said he loved her and that they would be together one day.’

At the end of April, Harrison invited the girl into his home when his mother was away. During the liaison he referred to her as his ‘girlfriend’ and they kissed and ‘dry humped’ on the sofa. The girl asked Harrison if she was like all the other girls but he told her: ‘No, it's completely different.’

The prosecutor said: ‘He said he couldn't wait until she was 16 and they could have sex. He showed her around the house, the last room being his bedroom and they both sat on the bed and began kissing.

‘Harrison undid her bra and touched her breasts and undressed her. She described them performing oral sex on each other.’

The pair met again a week later at Harrison's home and they engaged in more kissing and ‘dry humping’ on the sofa during which the teacher sucked the girl's breasts.

Afterwards they continued to text but she tried to stop because she felt guilty. He said wanted to remain friends. She agreed but deleted Harrison as a Facebook friend.

‘She felt that she had been used for sex,’ added Mr Orme. ‘At this time she felt angry and scared and she took the decision to tell the inclusion officer at school what had been happening.

‘She had been suffering depression since Christmas she had also tried to self-harm and had been referred for specialist support. She is a quiet, highly intelligent articulate girl and she has been greatly affected by this "relationship" which had developed beyond her control.’

Harrison admitted to an affair but said the girl had instigated the explicit texts and the sexual acts at his home - and he ‘went along with it’. He was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for ten years.

Judge Peter Davies told him: ‘These are serious matters because of your age gap. You were the adult and she was the child and it is for you to show responsibility, for you to say no and for you to desist.

‘When one is 14 years old and one has a sexual encounter with a 49-year-old former teacher the impact will be profound. The trauma to her psychology would have been intense and the extent will not be realised for some time to come.

‘She was a bright student who is now struggling with the consequences of what has happened and you should have realised the potential for this risk.’

In mitigation defence, Geoff Whelan said: ‘It is abundantly clear that when he did work as a teacher he was very good indeed. He has thrown away his life's work.’

But Det Sgt Louise Bentley, from Greater Manchester Police said after the case: ‘The victim's emotional and physical wellbeing has been affected as has her school work.

‘She has suffered enormously as a result of the abuse carried out by Harrison.

‘While he fully admitted what had happened he sought to minimise his responsibility and tried to blame the victim. As an experienced former teacher and middle-aged man I find such sentiments to be insulting to the victim and others in the profession.’
