Gareth Bale was predictably made to carry the can for Real Madrid’s defeat last night with the image of him doing up his laces as Sevilla scored the winner plastered over every single sports page.

Diario AS detailed the minute-by-minute of his decision to change his boots midway through the second half as Sevilla attacked down his right flank and scored the goal that could end up losing Real Madrid the title.

On 70 minutes 34 seconds Bale took advantage of a Sevilla substitution to change footwear but he was still on the sidelines on 71 minutes 53 seconds when Carlos Bacca scored. The ill-timed pit-stop did not finish until 72 minutes 30 seconds when Bales came back on with the game out of Real Madrid’s control.

The rollicking Bale received from Cristiano Ronaldo was also covered in detail as the Madrid press carried out the inquest on the first time in five years that they had lost two consecutive matches in the league.

Xabi Alsono tried to play down the incident saying: 'All the players were upset with themselves for the defeat.' But Ronaldo’s anger is clearly directed at Bale as he blasts a late free-kick off target with Ronaldo feeling he should have taken the kick.

'He comes from the cradle of rugby - perhaps that is why he puts so many over the bar,” sniped Diario AS’ resident critic Tomas Roncero.

It is customary for Bale and Ronaldo to share free-kick taking duties and on the night both had been woefully off target. Ronaldo had scored from a first half set-piece but only because the ball hit Sevilla’s Carlos Bacca on the arm to divert it past Beto in the Sevilla goal.

Diaro AS rounded off its savage criticism of Bale saying: 'He did not respond to the importance of the game. He made the wrong decisions even upsetting Ronaldo.'

Marca went slightly easier on Bale saying he had not been the only player out of position when Sevilla scored. But elsewhere he was slated and given a five out of 10 rating alongside the comment: 'It seems he plays better when he has injury problems.'

Madrid’s embarrassment was made complete by the fact that their misfiring 250m euros forward line, had been outdone by Carlos Bacca, a former bus conductor who cost 8m in the summer.
