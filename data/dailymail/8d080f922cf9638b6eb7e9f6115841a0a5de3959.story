Criticism: Popular broadcaster Stephen Fry has attacked critics of same sex marriage by claiming there are 260 species of animal which display gay tendencies  - but only humans are homophobic

Popular broadcaster Stephen Fry has attacked critics of same sex marriage by claiming there are 260 species of animal which display gay tendencies  - but only humans are homophobic.

The author and actor also said that the Olympic and Paralympic games showed that Britain is an open and tolerant society which is not negative towards those who love each other.

Fry was speaking during a new video for the Out4Marriage campaign, which supports changing the law to allow gay couples to marry.

During the three-minute monologue, he said: 'At least 260 species of animal have been noted exhibiting homosexual behaviour but only one species of animal ever, so far as we know, has exhibited homophobic behaviour — and that’s the human being.

'So ask which is really natural.'

During the video, Fry also accused the Church of England of listening to 'screeching' extremists who he claimed spread lies about same-sex marriage.

He said those supporting gay marriage did not want to force religious leaders to carry out same sex marriage ceremonies if they did not believe in them.

'The most important thing for me is that a misconception is cleared up that equal rights for gay marriage are not about forcing priests or clerics of any religion to marry people in their churches if they do not want too, it is not about that,' he said. 

'Those against gay marriage are somehow spreading this disinformation that we are going to say that "you Reverend so and so are forced to hold this gay marriage in your church", it is not true.'

He added: 'There are other faiths like Quakers and Congregationalists and Unitarians and the Liberal Reform part of the Jewish faith who are actually extremely keen,' he said.

'They feel their communion won’t be complete unless it includes gay marriage because they believe in social justice and equality too.

'It’s wrong, in a country like ours, which has an established Church, just because their more extreme end is screeching with outrage at the idea of this, that we are not allowed to be married.'

He said the Olympic and Paralympic Games proved that Britain is an open, generous and tolerant society which is diverse and 'full of love'.

He said we celebrate our openness and tolerance and not ' be down on other people who love each other and are no threat to anybody else.'

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Joseph Musgrave, for the Out4Marriage campaign, said 'Stephen Fry has brought his own inimitable style to a point we have long sought to clarify.

'No religious group should be in any way forced to conduct or solemnise same-sex marriages.'

A spokesman for the Church of England said  it would continue to debate same-sex marriage.
