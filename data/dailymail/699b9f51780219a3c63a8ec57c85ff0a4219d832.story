Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino refused to look beyond Sunday's season-ending match with Manchester United as speculation continues over his future and the futures of many of his leading players.

The Argentinian has guided Saints to an eighth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League this term, one place behind last season's champions United, with his management and his players' ability attracting numerous admirers.

'I have the same goals, the same wishes,' Pochettino said.

'Of course I want to be successful, to be ambitious and always to improve as a manager.

'This Sunday when the game finishes with Manchester United a project of five years that has been happening will come to an end.

'It's up the board to discuss with me the new project that will be in place starting next season.

'It's not really up to me to decide when those talks happen but the club overall has to explain to me what this new project consists of and how it's going to start next season.'

Asked specifically about reports Tottenham are keen to appoint him as boss, Pochettino added: 'Many things are bandied around and spoken and there are a lot of rumours thrown around.'

Skipper Adam Lallana has been linked with a move away from St Mary's Stadium, with Liverpool among those reportedly targeting the attacking midfielder.

'I pretty much have the same information as you have, the same as you received through the media,' Pochettino added.

'The club has not spoken to me officially about anything so I have the same information as you have.'

Pochettino told supporters fearing their manager could depart and their team could be sold off in the close season to live in the moment.

He added: 'I don't think you can live in the fear of the future.

'What's important right now is to enjoy this moment, the present, to relish this magnificent season that we've had.

'I think Sunday is a very good chance to create an amazing atmosphere, to enjoy the game and the end of this amazing season.

'We always say goodbye because we finish a chapter and we start a new chapter.'

Southampton have no fresh injury concerns.

Jay Rodriguez (knee), Gaston Ramirez (ankle) and Maya Yoshida (knee) remain absent, as is back-up goalkeeper Kelvin Davis (back).
