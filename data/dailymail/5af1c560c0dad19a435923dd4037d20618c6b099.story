Former SAS sniper Danny Nightingale has lost his latest battle against conviction for illegally possessing a 9mm Glock pistol and 300 rounds of ammunition.

Last July the special forces soldier was sentenced to two years’ military detention, suspended for 12 months, by a military court in Bulford, Wiltshire, after he was convicted for the second time.

Today, three
 judges sitting at the Court Martial Appeal Court in London rejected an 
application by Sergeant Nightingale, 39, from Crewe, Cheshire for permission to appeal against the conviction.

He was found guilty of having a 9mm Glock pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition - kept as a trophy from his days in Iraq - in the bedroom of his shared Army house.

Former SAS sniper Danny Nightingale has lost his latest battle against conviction for illegally possessing a 9mm Glock pistol and 300 rounds of ammunition

Last July the special forces soldier was sentenced to two years¿ military detention, suspended for 12 months, by a military court in Bulford, Wiltshire, after he was convicted for the second time

The pistol was found in his wardrobe and ammunition was under his bed in a plastic 
box in September, 2011.

He was originally ordered to serve 18 months in military detention after pleading guilty in November 2012. 

He was then released after the Court of Appeal cut and suspended his sentence to 12-months.

He was found guilty of having a 9mm Glock pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition in the bedroom of his shared Army house. The pistol was found in his wardrobe and ammunition was under his bed in a plastic box in September, 2011

His conviction was then entirely overturned on appeal in March 2013, on the basis that he had been placed under ‘improper pressure’ to plead guilty - and in May, a judge ordered a retrial.

In July, the special forces soldier was sentenced to two years’ military detention, suspended for 12 months, by a military court in Bulford, Wiltshire.

During
 a military career starting in 1995 he served in the former Yugoslavia, 
Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He received a medical discharge,
 remaining in the Army until it commenced in February this year.

Police found the arsenal at the home he shared with an SAS comrade – identified only as Soldier N – after a tip-off.

Sgt Nightingale, a veteran of 18 years, told detectives he was given the Glock as a war trophy by Iraqi troops he trained in the warzone in 2007.

He said the ammunition was left over from his job as a range instructor.

But at his six-day trial last year the soldier changed his story, insisting he had made a ‘false confession’.

The married father-of-two blamed his confusion on memory loss caused by a brain injury suffered when he collapsed during a charity run in the Brazilian jungle in 2009.

He said he had no recollection of receiving the weapon and explained he filled in gaps in his memory with stories other people had told him – a medical condition known as ‘confabulation’.

He argued that Soldier N, serving two years in prison after admitting possessing another Glock, brought both pistols back from Iraq and planted one in his bedroom to avoid a tougher sentence.

But the board rejected his story and found him guilty, concluding he had put the public at risk by storing the cache in his rented house in Hereford.

Rejecting Nightingale's renewed application for permission to appeal, Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Hickinbottom and Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, said there was a 'considerable amount' of evidence before the court martial which 'supported' the conviction.

Lord Thomas said the appeal court could not see 'in any way' how his proposed grounds of appeal - the principal one relating to expert evidence - would 'affect the conviction'.

Dismissing his application for permission to appeal today, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas ruled that there was nothing in the grounds he wished to argue which affected the safety of his conviction.
