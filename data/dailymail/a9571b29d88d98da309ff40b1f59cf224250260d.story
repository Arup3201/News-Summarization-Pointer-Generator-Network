Lee Rigby's family have fought hard to stop Far Right groups co-opting his name for their causes

Speaker John Bercow is being accused of protecting a Left-wing ‘quango queen’ responsible for letting an extreme-Right party use butchered soldier Lee Rigby’s name in this week’s elections.

Sources revealed that Jenny Watson, head of the Electoral Commission, offered to resign after Britain First was mistakenly allowed to use the description ‘Remember Lee Rigby’ on voting slips for Thursday’s European polls - which fall on the first anniversary of his death.

The approval given to Britain First - a breakaway group of former BNP activists which describes itself as a 'patriotic resistance frontline' – to adopt the slogan has appalled MPs and Fusilier Rigby’s family.

But by the time the blunder had been spotted, it was too late to amend ballot papers.

Government sources revealed that Mr Bercow refused to accept Miss Watson’s resignation over the fiasco. The Commission – the country’s elections watchdog -- is answerable to Parliament via a committee headed by the Speaker.

‘Bercow has protected Jenny Watson,’ said one. ‘This is a dreadful episode and ultimately, she is in charge of the body that it responsible for it.’

Lyn Rigby, the murdered soldier’s mother, has said she is heartbroken that the group has been allowed to attempt to hijack his death for its own ends.

Britain First applied to use seven slogans in the European elections and four were rejected, but the one relating to Fusilier Rigby was approved by the watchdog.

After a damning report on the Electoral Commission’s handling of the affair, Miss Watson apologised and said it ‘should never have been permitted’.

The commission's director of party and election finance Peter Horne’s resignation was accepted rather than hers. He ‘remembered thinking that it was distasteful but not sufficient to cause offence’, according to an independent investigation.

The commission’s staff were found to have they failed to consider the need to protect public safety, morals and the rights and reputations of others.

The watchdog has now agreed to introduce new rules over the descriptions political parties can use at the ballot box.

Fusilier Rigby, from Greater Manchester, was murdered as he returned to his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London on May 22 2013, in a crime that horrified the nation. He died of multiple stab wounds.

Two men, Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were found guilty of his barbaric murder after a trial at the Old Bailey. Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale a minimum of 45 years in jail.

Conservative MP Gary Streeter, chairman of the Speaker’s committee on the Electoral Commission, said: ‘Jenny Watson did offer her resignation. The Speaker and the Speaker’s committee agreed that the right thing to do was not to accept it.

‘We were mindful that the person directly responsible for the error did resign, and also that there are very big changes coming up in the electoral system coming up in the next few months and a referendum in Scotland.

‘It is all terribly distressing. Jenny Watson did speak to each member of the family personally but it won’t alleviate their distress.’

Geraint Davies, Labour and Co-operative MP for Swansea West, said the oversight was so grave that he believed Miss Watson should have quit.

‘It is completely unacceptable for Lee Rigby’s memory to be sullied by any political party, let alone one with views as odious as the BNP splinter group Britain First,’ he said.

‘The Commission’s decision to place Fusilier Rigby’s name alongside this racist and Islamophobic party on ballot papers is simply inexcusable.’

Cabinet Office minister Greg Clark said it was sickening that anyone should attempt to make political capital out of Fusilier Rigby's murder.

‘The whole country will be outraged that the memory of Lee Rigby should be abused in this way, and our heart goes out to his family, friends and colleagues,’ he added.

Miss Watson once headed the now-defunct Equal Opportunities Commission as well as working for the Left-wing campaign organisation Charter 88 and the gender equality group The Fawcett Society.

She faced calls to resign from the Electoral Commission in 2010, after presiding over chaos which led to hundreds of voters being turned away from general election polling stations.

Police had to deal with queues as the voting deadline passed in Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, parts of London and Surrey. The head of the Electoral Commission insisted the situation would ‘never happen again.’

An Electoral Commission spokesman said “On April 29 the chair of the Commission, in advance of the independent investigation concluding, offered her resignation which the Speaker’s committee did not accept. At the time the Speaker’s committee had not yet received or considered the report from the independent investigator. Once it had considered the report, the committee concluded that there were no grounds for the chair of the Commission to resign.’
