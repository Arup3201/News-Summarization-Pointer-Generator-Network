Early strikes from Joel Matip and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting led Schalke to a 2-1 victory over bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund in the Ruhr derby. 

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pulled one back for last season's runners-ups but Jurgen Klopp's men could not conjure up a crucial equaliser. 

Dortmund captain Mats Hummels made his first start of the season after recovering from injury, but the defender made a nightmare start as Matip gave Schalke a 10th-minute lead.

The joy of the Schalke supporters contrasted with dismay for Dortmund fans who dropped points

Hummels looked out of position and the Cameroonian player powered a header past visiting keeper Roman Weidenfeller. 

And just 13 minutes later the Dortmund stopper was alert to keep out Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, but his defence again let him down as Choupo-Moting drilled in the rebound. 

In-form Aubameyang cut the deficit three minutes later but despite a strong second half showing Dortmund could not fashion a leveller.

The predatory Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang quickly made it 2-1 but Schalke held on for a famous win 

It's a third loss in six league games for Dortmund, who sit ninth in the fledgling Bundesliga table and travel to Anderlecht in the Champions League on Wednesday.  

Schalke meanwhile rise to seventh ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash with Maribor.
