Ten-year-old Cory Nieves launched a cookie business at the tender age of five to help buy his mom a car because he was tired of taking the bus to school in the freezing cold.

The pint-size New Jersey entrepreneur has since become the CEO of his very own incorporated baking company that has been churning out thousands of cookies each week.

Cory's incredible rags-to-riches story, along with his impeccable fashion sense and winning personality, have earned him a broad following online and turned him into a media sensation.

On Tuesday, a dapper Cory Nieves was invited to talk about his company, Mr Cory's Cookies, on MSNBC's News Nation hosted by Tamron Hall.

Sporting an elegant vest and a red power tie, the young CEO explained that the idea for Mr Cory's Cookies grew out of a humble stand he had set up outside his home in 2009 selling hot cocoa to earn money towards a car for his mother.

The boy later added homemade baked goods to the menu, and before long Mr Cory's Cookies was up and running.

The dashing young businessman told Ms Hall that he started out working off cookie recipes he had found online, but he eventually developed his own unique formula, in which 75 per cent of the ingredients are organic and there are no preservatives.

In 2012, Nieves and his mother incorporated their company and moved their business out of their home and into a commercial kitchen.
