At first glance it might not seem like the most appetising of ingredients – but chefs have long championed bone marrow as a cheap and tasty option.

Now Waitrose is getting in on the act, adding it to their butcher’s selection along with pig’s trotters and lamb’s tails in a new ‘forgotten cuts’ range.

Shoppers who have found themselves squeezed by soaring bills are starting to rediscover things that fell out of favour in the rush to ready meals.

Top London restaurants have served up bone marrow for years

Not only are they cheaper, but these 
cuts – which were enjoyed by generations of Britons – are a tasty way to
feed a hungry family.

The paste-like, fatty substance, found inside bones, is now being stocked as part 
of the supermarket's 'Forgotten Cuts' range, with Waitrose describing it
as 'perfect for enriching sauces or a garnish'.

Waitrose will enlist the help of its food ambassador Heston Blumenthal to put bone marrow top of our shopping lists

Waitrose
buyer Rob Hues said: 'Bone marrow has been a key ingredient in some of 
London's top meat restaurants such has Hawksmoor and St John's Bread and Wine where they both promote the nose to tail dining experience.

At Hawksmoor restaurants, bone marrow can either be enjoyed with onions as a starter or as a side dish with your main.

'Those "in the know" understand that by adding bone marrow you can intensify meaty flavours,' says Hues.

Waitrose will enlist the help of its food ambassador Heston Blumenthal to put bone marrow top of our shopping lists with his latest recipe, ‘Traditional Minced Beef and Dumplings’, which uses the ingredient to intensify the flavour of the meaty dish.

Bone marrow will be introduced to 
Waitrose customers in a pack, which also contains diced shin, the other key ingredient of Heston’s dish.

The recipe will be unveiled in TV and print adverts next Wednesday and will be supported in branches with recipe cards and an introductory one third off the price of diced beef shin with bone marrow.

The 450 gram pack will cost £4.99.

Top London restaurants have served up bone marrow for years for England's foodies as part of the movement to waste less of slaughtered animals and use the parts usually discarded.

Bone marrow is used across the world as it has a high fat and protein content and is one of the easiest forms of offal to obtain as it simply can be scooped out of any bone.

It is used regularly in Vietnamese, Hungarian, Pakistani,  Lebanese and Iranian cuisines, often in soups or stews.

In Italy it's the key ingredient of the traditional dish ossobuco (braised veal shanks), and in France it is is eaten on toast with a little salt.

Niamh Shields founder of popular food blog eatlikeagirlcom says: 'Bone marrow is the ultimate umami hit.

Toasted and scooped out of the bone and served on sourdough toast with shallots and parsley a la London restaurant St John is one of the best ways to have it.

'I also like to roast it with a parmesan parsley and breadcrumb crust. In Montreal earlier this year I had it served with raw oysters on top which tasted fabulous.

'I think it is great that Waitrose plans to sell it. We need to embrace the whole animal as meat eaters and not just the prime cuts.'
