As well as revealing the most reviewed destinations and businesses of 2014, TripAdvisor has also named the most prolific individual contributors in the UK this year.

As well as being the most reviewed city in the world, the director of VisitLondon.com, Julie Chappell, said: 'London continues to welcome many millions of visitors each year who come to experience the capital's unparalleled blend of rich history and heritage, culture, and world famous attractions. 

'London has experienced a post-Olympic 2012 tourism boost and in 2013, the city welcomed a record 16.8 million international visitors.

'It is fantastic news that visitors to our city are so engaged in sharing their experiences on TripAdvisor during their time here, that we have retained our position as the most reviewed city in the world.'

TripAdvisor now features more than 200 million reviews and opinions from its global travel community, covering more than 4.4 million businesses and properties in 145,000 destinations.

Steve Jackson from Gateshead began using TripAdvisor in 2008 and this year he has been named the UK's top contributor of photos having submitted 1,587 in 2014. 

Tourism in London received an even bigger boost following the 2012 Olympic Games

'Before I started using TripAdvisor I thought I was well informed and well travelled but I now know that there are so many amazing places out there that I had never even heard of,' said Jackson

'It's thanks to the TripAdvisor community that I have been able to discover those places, which is why I like to share real photos of everywhere I go as a way to give something back to those who've helped me.'

Barbara Messing, chief marketing officer for TripAdvisor added: 'Our global travel community adds 115 contributions to the site every minute, helping to make TripAdvisor the world's best place to plan a trip.

'We thank our most active members, as well as each of our contributors. Their candid feedback is the lifeblood of TripAdvisor and helps others find the information and advice they need before they travel or visit a business.'

Leslie Cawthorne, TripAdvisor's most prolific poster, is classed as a Disneyland Paris destination expert.

She has written 44 reviews in total this year; 12 on hotels, 19 on restaurants, and 13 on attractions.
