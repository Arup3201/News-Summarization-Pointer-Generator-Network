This is the horrific injury sustained by a 64-year-old pensioner after a drunken actor bit off part of her finger during a row on a bus.

Gary Bradley, 29, attacked Kathleen Hainey on a bus in Greenock, Renfrewshire, on October 22 last year when she tried to stop him pestering a teenage girl.

Bradley, who admitted being drunk at the time, also attacked 43-year-old Brian Thomas, biting and punching him in the head and arm, when he also tried to intervene.

Bradley was harassing 19-year-old Nicole Shirley when fellow passenger Brian Thompson, 43, tried to stop him. After the pair began fighting Mrs Hainey tried to separate them and Bradley bit her

Edinburgh High Court heard that Bradley, who was previously sentenced to five years in jail for serious assault, had been waiting with his victims at a bus stop before the attack occurred.

While waiting for the bus to arrive Bradley tried to speak to Nicole Shirley, 19, but she told him she was not interested and moved away.

Once everyone had boarded the bus Bradley again tried to talk to Miss Shirley. When Mr Thomas offered to get off at the same stop to protect her, Bradley became angry.

He swung at Mr Thomas, who grabbed him in an attempt to stop the struggle, when Bradley bit him on the head and left forearm

Mrs Hainey got up from her seat and tried to separate the pair when Bradley bit the tip of her left little finger off.

She was taken to hospital where she was given a tetanus shot and had the wound washed with anti-septic. She was then examined by surgeons who had to remove an inch of her finger.

Sitting at the High Court, Lady Rae said: 'One [victim] was a 43-year-old man who was simply trying to stop you pestering a young woman who was clearly disinterested in your drunken and unwanted attentions.

'The second person was a 64-year-old lady who bravely tried to intervene to stop the fight.

'Not satisfied with biting the man, you reacted to her attempts to stop the fight by biting the tip of her finger off, resulting in operative treatment which led to amputation of part of her finger.'

Defending Bradley, Thomas Ross said he had trained as a barber and was working as an actor on a couple of local productions. He said he had also been caring for his ill mother. 

Mr Ross added that Bradley’s brother had been fatally stabbed in 2013 which led to a man’s conviction for culpable homicide.

He said: 'He [Bradley] was heavily under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offence.

'He has demonstrated a high level of remorse, particularly towards Kathleen Hainey. He has learnt a lesson.' 

The fight happened in October last year as the trio were riding on a bus along Burns Road, in Greenock, Renfrewshire (file image)

The judge told Bradley, formerly of Kylemore Terrace, Greenock, that he would have faced a six-year prison term, but for his early guilty pleas.

She instead locked him up for four years, saying the sentence should run consecutively to a nine-month jail term he is already serving.

Bradley interrupted the judge during her sentencing and announced he wanted to make a public apology. The judge said also noted that he knew he had 'anger management issues'.

She said: 'I also note you are not unintelligent and have a work ethic.'
