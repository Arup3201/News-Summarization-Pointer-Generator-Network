Police were called out to Ariel Castro's block more than 1,000 times during the period he is alleged to have held young women captive at his house

Police visited Ariel Castro's block more than 1,000 during the period he allegedly held young women captive - and his house was one of the quietest in a chaotic neighborhood.

From August 2002 to May this year, when the women emerged from the Cleveland, Ohio house, police were called out to the block roughly once every three days.

Most calls were to report crimes, according to police records.

Castro's house, 2207 Seymour Avenue, was one of the quietest, reports NBC News, with officers attending his home only twice during the time Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry were missing.

The first police visit was in January 2004, when police interviewed Castro about a complaint that he left a young boy on the school bus he drove while he ate at a branch of Wendy's.

The second, in July 2009, was when Castro reported a fight on the street.

There is no suggestion that police missed crucial signs that could have led them to the missing women.

Some neighbors claimed they had told police that women were naked and chained-up in the back yard during the period Knight, DeJesus and Berry were missing.

But police say they have no records of these reports while the women themselves said they only went outside twice, wearing wigs and sunglasses.

One house on Seymour Avenue, which has 16 houses and two apartment blocks, was visited 68 times by police while numbers 2115 and 2003 racked up 37 and 35 visit respectively.

Crime reports included calls about domestic abuse, flashers and vandalism.

One 2006 fight involved 20 people armed with baseball bats, which led to the hospitalization of a pregnant woman.

Community organiser Khalid Samad 
described the neighborhood on the night the women emerged from the 
Castro house as an example of the day-to-day life on the area.

He told NBC: 'Not an hour after they're out, I'm standing on the street near the Castro house and a fight broke out a few doors down because a guy who was out there saw a guy who he recognized as having shot him on the street.

'Dude took off running, and they're wrestling down in front of the church. That's the kind of thing that would go on there.'

Last week Castro pleaded not guilty to 329 
counts, including 139 counts of rape, 177 counts of kidnapping, seven 
counts of gross sexual imposition, three counts of felonious assault and
 one count of possession of criminal tools.

Investigators are checking new 
evidence found in the house where he allegedly kept three women chained 
up for more than ten years, to determine if there were other victims.

Ohio
 investigators have been searching for evidence of other girls kept at 
the house or signs of aborted fetuses since Amanda Berry's escape from Castro in May.

The
 nature and source of the evidence has not yet been released but 
Attorney General Mike DeWine said it was normal in a case like this for 
additional evidence to be gathered.

'We are well on our way. We've 
processed a lot of the evidence already. We have a ways to go, but we're
 making very good progress with it,' he said.

The 52-year-old's charges cover August
 2002, when he is said to have kidnapped his first victim, Michelle 
Knight, to February 2007.

More charges could be added to his file, as police investigate the kidnap of Miss Berry, Miss Knight, and Gina DeJesus, who was 14 when she was snatched on her way home from school.

The indictment alleges the former school bus driver held the women chained to a pole in a basement, or to a bedroom heater or inside a van.

It says that when one of the women tried to escape Castro, who is being held on $8billion bail, assaulted her by wrapping a vacuum cord around her neck.

As well as fathering a child with Miss Berry, Castro allegedly impregnated Miss Knight on five occasions but would punch her in the stomach until she had a miscarriage.

At his arraignment on Wednesday, the grand jury charged Castro with two counts of aggravated murder related to one act, saying he purposely caused the unlawful termination of one of the women's pregnancies.

Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty has said that he would seek the death penalty for Castro.

One of the former bus driver's attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said however that Castro would be willing to plead guilty to some of the charges and forgo a trial in exchange for a deal that would spare him a death sentence, the Ohio Plain Dealer reported.

A statement issued on behalf of the women said days like Castro's arraignment 'are not easy' and added: 'We are hopeful for a just and prompt resolution. We have great faith in the prosecutor's office and the court.'

Forensic experts say it is common for DNA samples to be crosschecked to see if there are other victims or people involved in a crime, according to CNN.
