The first daughter looks to have set her sights on working behind the scenes in Hollywood after visiting the Los Angeles set of a new sci-fi show last week.

Malia Obama, who turns 16 on July 4, spent a day working as a production assistant on the set of Halle Berry‘s upcoming sci-fi series Extant.

The series is being produced by prominent Obama donor Steven Spielberg.

First Lady Michelle Obama accompanied Malia to the CBS Studios as the teen helped with re-shoots of the pilot episode, assisting with computer alignments, and the director even let her use a production slate before a take.

An unnamed source told TheWrap.com that Malia laughed with delight saying, ‘My first time. This is a big deal.’

In the series Berry plays an astronaut who returns home from a year-long solo mission in space and tries to reconnect with her husband and son. 

Her experiences in space and home lead to events that ultimately change the course of human history.

Extant is being produced by Steven Spielberg, who presented President Barack  with an Ambassador for Humanity Award earlier this year

Neither CBS nor a spokesperson for the First Lady have so far commented.

Malia attends the exclusive Sidwell Friends private school in Washington, DC, but classes let out earlier this month.

President Obama, Michelle and Malia enjoyed a four-day weekend in southern California, staying at a private residence inside the gated community of Thunderbird Heights, in the high-end city of Rancho Mirage.

The President and First Lady flew in Friday. Obama delivered the commencement address at the University of California, Irvine, on Saturday before attending a fundraiser in Orange County.

Sasha Obama apparently did not make the Father’s Day weekend trip, which was expected to include golfing and perhaps some house-hunting for the Obamas, reports Press Enterprise.

The Obama family is scheduled to fly home to Washington, D.C. mid-morning on Monday.

At Saturday's commencement address, the President said denying climate change is like arguing the moon is made of cheese.

Obama issued the call to the tens of thousands gathered at Angel Stadium even though he said Congress 'is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence' and say climate change is a hoax or fad.

Obama said others duck the question.

'They say, "Hey, look, I'm not a scientist." And I'll translate that for you: what that really means is, "I know that manmade climate change really is happening but if I admit it, I'll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot,'" he said.

Obama also used the address to announce a $1 billion competitive fund for communities who have experienced natural disasters to rebuild and prepare for the impact of extreme weather.

He described a political system consumed by 'small things' but said Americans should be determined to do 'big things' like addressing climate change, despite the type of opposition he faces from Congress.

'There's going to be a stubborn status quo and people determined to stymie your efforts to bring about change. There are going to be people who say you can't do something. There are going to be people who say you shouldn't bother trying. I've got some experience with this myself,' Obama said.

'It's pretty rare that you'll encounter somebody who says the problem you're trying to solve simply doesn't exist.

'When
 President Kennedy set us on a course to the moon, there were a number 
of people who made a serious case that it wouldn't be worth it,' he 
continued.

'But nobody ignored the science. I don't remember anybody saying the moon wasn't there or that it was made of cheese,' Obama said.

The president said today's young dreamers are fed a steady diet of cynicism but argued they have a right to be optimistic.

'Consider this: since the time most of you graduated from high school, fewer Americans are at war,' Obama said.

'More have health insurance. More are graduating from college. Our businesses have added more than nine million new jobs.

'And the number of states where you're free to marry who you love has more than doubled. That's just some of the progress you've seen.'

While in Orange County, Obama also raised money for the Democratic National Committee at a closed-door fundraiser at the Laguna Beach home of Getty oil heiress Anne Earhart. About 25 people paid up to $32,400 to participate in a roundtable discussion with the president.

He's spending the rest of the Father's Day weekend on vacation at the Rancho Mirage home of White House decorator Michael Smith and his partner, U.S. Ambassador to Spain James Costos.
