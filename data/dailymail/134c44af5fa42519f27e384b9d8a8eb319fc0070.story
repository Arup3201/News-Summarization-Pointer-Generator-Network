A 27-year-old cheerleading coach has been arrested for allegedly having a 10-month sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student.

Nicole Kurowski, from Reading, Pennsylvania, allegedly exchanged thousands of text messages with the boy including ones reading, 'I love you,' and photos of an explicit nature.

The messages indicated that the pair even had sexual contact during school hours at Tulpehocken High School, where Kurowski also taught physical education, authorities said.

Pennsylvania State Police launched an investigation after the school district received a tip by email that the pair had engaged in a sexual relationship between October 2012 to August 2013.

this matter very seriously.'

Albert also contacted state police and District Attorney John T. Adams that day.

She was charged with institutional sexual assault and released on $25,000 unsecured bail.

Kurowski, who had worked at the school for two years, was initially suspended with pay but now that she has been charged, she is no longer being paid.
