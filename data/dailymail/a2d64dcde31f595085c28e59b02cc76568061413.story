An off-duty FBI agent shot and killed a dog as a woman walked it in a park with her four-year-old grandson so he could protect his own pet.

Carol Feldhaus was crossing a small bridge in Glen Burnie, Maryland, with her daughter's five-year-old great Dane called Flynn when the undercover officer approached the other side.

The two animals then got angry and growled at each, so Mrs Feldhaus asked for him to wait.

The great Dane called Flynn (pictured) was shot and killed by an undercover an off-duty FBI agent while he was being walked by a woman and her grandson in Glen Burnie, Maryland 

Carol Feldhaus, who was knocked off her feet when the animal broke from its leash, still had blood on her hands from where she tried to save the beloved animal 

Despite the plea, he carried on, and Flynn broke free from his leash and ran at the other dog.

The great Dane attacked, so the undercover officer drew his gun and shot him dead.

A devastated Mrs Feldhaus was pulled off her feet and she still had blood on her hands when she spoke to WMAR as the dog approached her covered in blood.

She told the station: 'I turned around this guy just kept coming and Fynn the great Dane jerked and pulled me down. 

'I heard the dogs barking at each other and growl. Next thing I heard was "bam bam".

'And I'm half way up and the dog just walks to me and drops and there's blood everywhere. I was in shock and I said "you shot the dog?" And he said he was an undercover cop and he was protecting his dog.'

Mrs Feldhaus admitted that Flynn did injure the other dog, but questioned the officers need to use his weapon.

The dog's owner and Mrs Feldhaus' daughter Amanda Ericson said Flynn was a gentle giant, but admitted she has been dragged away from other dogs before 

Blankets covered in blood remained at the scene from where the owners tried to treat the dogs

She added: 'Pulling a gun and shooting another dog in a park -- what is wrong with this man?'

The dog's owner Amanda Ericson said Flynn was normally a gentle giant, but admitted he had been separated by dogs before.

However she said that her mother and her young son may need therapy as a result of the tragic incident.  

FBI spokesman Amy Thoreson told the station: 'There was an FBI Agent involved in an incident in Glen Burnie this morning. Initial information is that an approximately 180 pound dog broke free from the woman walking it along a footpath near Hopkins Corner and attacked a much smaller dog. 

'An Agent shot and killed the larger dog. No one else was hurt. We are working jointly with Anne Arundel County PD, as well as the Inspection Division from FBI Headquarters to investigate. 

'This is an ongoing matter, and will have more information as soon as we gather more details.'

An investigation into the dog's death has been started.
