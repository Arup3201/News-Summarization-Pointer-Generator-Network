Australia has chosen the winner in one of the most interesting competitions of the year, the hottest ginger awards.

Sydney pole dancer Bailey Hart took out the People's Choice Award in the competition organised by Buderim Ginger, who launched the unique competition in November, and received more than 2000 flame-haired entrants vying for the prize pool of over $10,000.

Bailey, who teaches pole dancing at Suzie Q Pole Studio in North Parramatta, originally entered the competition for a bit of fun when one of her students suggested the idea.

She is a competitive pole dancer based in Sydney, who has a 'fondness' for orangutans 

'It's a bit of kick and bit of laugh and fun,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'The competition for me, it was never a serious thing, it was all just a bit of fun,' Bailey added.

She received over 12,000 votes, and said that was a great example of how close-knit the pole community is.

'It was so nice to see how much support I got from the pole community,' Bailey said.

But now her winnings are going towards a cause close to her heart. 

The 27-year-old has decided to use her prizes to raise money for a fellow flame-haired being, the orangutans. 

Bailey, 27, received the most votes in the online competition which offers a prize pool of more than $10,000

The competition was put on by Australian drink company Buderim Ginger and received over 2000 entrants

The competitive pole dancer is going to raffle off a number of her prizes won in the competition 

She has previously travelled to Borneo to work with orangutans at an orphanage 

'I'm raffling the prizes off so that I can raise money for the Orangutan Foundation International (OFI),' Bailey revealed. 

'I actually went to Borneo in December 2013 and I spent a few weeks there with OFI ... We got to spend time at the care facility where the orphans are, meet the vets and spend time with the animals.'

When asked why it was orangutans specifically that she wanted to help, Bailey's answer was simple: 'I've always had a fondness for these creatures'. 

The pole dancer wants to head overseas again in the coming years to do more work, but next on the cards for her is a new competition inspired by her two favourite things.

In the works is a new pole dance 'movement competition' called Swing Free, with the name inspired by her love of dance and her furry orange friends.

Still to be announced are the one red-haired female and one male winner will be awarded the key title and will become the newest faces of Division Model Management in a 12-month contract

 

The prizes she won in the Hottest Ginger Competition, along with others that have been donated, will be auctioned off on March 20 at the Rising Stars pole competition held in Melbourne.

Still to be announced are the one red-haired female and one male winner will be awarded the key title and will become the newest faces of Division Model Management in a 12-month contract.

The company launched the competition to celebrate all things ginger, and break down the walls of 'gingerism' by inviting people to enter themselves, their red-headed pet, or their best ginger moustache or beard for the public vote.

After thousands of entrants, the results are in for the male and female contestants, with four fiery-locked finalists competing for the final title of 'Australia's Hottest Ginger'.

Indeya Passfield, based in Randwick in Sydney, described herself as a 'red-headed fireball who is intent on doing something good.'

'I was super surprised when I got the phone call to say I was a finalist. There were so many amazing entries and different types of ginger, it was so awesome to be selected,' Indeya said

For the ladies section, Perth girl Bec Mountford, 18, and Sydney woman Indeya Passfield made the cut for the Hottest Gingers in Australia. 

Bec describes herself as a 'proud ginger', and entered the competition after being convinced by a friend.

Indeya, based in Randwick in Sydney, described herself as a 'red-headed fireball who it intent on doing something good.' 

'I don't think ginger has necessarily been celebrated before. It's very cool, it gives gingers a chance to get one up on everyone else,' Indeya told Daily Mail Australia.

'I definitely think we are a superior breed,' Indeya joked.

'It's a great way to celebrate something that hasn't been in the spotlight. But putting four of us in the one room, our natural fiery competitive spirit is bound to come out,' Indeya said

In the men's section, Sydney-based veterinarian Nicholas Glen and Brisbane lad Nick Cox made the top of the ginger list.

Nicholas, 30, described himself as a 'born and bred ginger', and is excited and nervous about the final announcement in a few weeks.  

Nick Cox, 20, who is from Lutwyche in Brisbane, said he entered the competition as he is the younger brother of a blond surfer and that he was here 'to show him up'.

Indeya told Daily Mail Australia that she was excited to see red-heads celebrated, and that there was 'a whole new wheel of colour dedicated to it, from freckles and blue eyes, to dark eyes and dark features'.
