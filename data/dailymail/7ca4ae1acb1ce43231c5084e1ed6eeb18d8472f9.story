Arsene Wenger may have officially become an OAP at 65 but there are still one or two scores he has to settle before he actually contemplates retirement.

He goes into tonight’s Champions League tie against Anderlecht at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium with enough problems to add to his worry lines — not least exposing 22-year-old Emiliano Martinez to a Champions League debut when his most recent competitive match was in the Championship last season.

But despite being old enough to qualify for a bus pass, Wenger still has a point to prove in Europe, famously never having won the Champions League despite contesting it 16 times with Arsenal and twice with Monaco.

‘Do I feel young?’ said Wenger. ‘No, my age is my age. You have to live with that. Until now I am lucky to be in shape. But the desire and motivation is stronger than ever. 

'I am so keen to do well with my team this season. I want the club and the team to do as well as they can, it’s my dream. I want to give absolutely everything for my team to do it.

‘I am not a celebrator of birthdays. What is important is my team performs well and I will dedicate all my energy to get things right. 

'There is a difference between the quality of our performances and points we have won. So we want to add to the quality of our performance, and get the points that we feel are there in the team. That little percentage, where we can improve, is vital.’

Wenger’s keeper crisis will be the key preoccupation tonight, with Martinez, replacing suspended Wojciech Szczesny, having conceded five goals in a Capital One Cup tie at Reading two years ago.

Wenger remained upbeat about his squad despite the huge number of injuries effecting Arsenal

David Ospina joins the Arsenal injury list which also includes...

Mesut Ozil, Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy,  Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and Laurent Koscielny, while Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry and Jack Wilshere are all still struggling for fitness.

And Martinez will have a job to do after tonight as the club’s temporary No 2 keeper, with Wenger revealing Colombian David Ospina will be out until the New Year in yet another Arsenal injury setback.

Wenger said: ‘Ospina had his first injury at Nice (his former club), which was a knee problem, and I think he was a bit rushed back. He then got injured during the World Cup. And after that he came to us injured.

‘I had to bring him on against Galatasaray without a warm-up, without being prepared, and he had a recurrence of that injury. That means he is out for two to three months. Now we have to be really careful because he has a recurrence of a thigh injury that’s very difficult. It’s a long-term injury.’ 

At least Wenger can welcome back Aaron Ramsey against Anderlecht after he came through his substitute appearance against Hull on Saturday. The midfielder could start here in Brussels tonight along with Mikel Arteta, who also returned to the bench on Saturday.

Arsene Wenger has had to call up young keepers Ryan Huddart, Josh Vickers, Matt Macey. Read more about Wenger's young keepers here.

Jack Wilshere has backed Martinez to provide Arsenal with the stability they need against the Belgian champions.

‘He has grown up in the last two years, playing at Sheffield Wednesday on loan in the Championship, which is a very tough league to play in, especially in England as a foreign lad,’ said Wilshere.

‘We’re confident in him, we train with him every day, see what he can do and he’ll be ready.’

The England midfielder maintains that despite only having won four games all season, Arsenal will eventually dispel the notion they are a lightweight team.

‘I think that’s unfair. Maybe we haven’t got the results we wanted in some games, or drawn when should have won, but if we look back we’ve had a positive start. 

'Ok, we need more points than we have in the table, but going forward we are confident we can get the points we need.

‘We just ignore that criticism. We know what we can do in midfield. Maybe our strongest point is going forward, we know we can defend, we have players who can put their foot in and we have players who can organise in Flamini. 

'We have good defensive players. We know on Saturday the performance wasn’t good enough.’
