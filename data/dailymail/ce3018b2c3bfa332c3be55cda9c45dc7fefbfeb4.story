He might be retiring from the Army but it appears that Prince Harry won't be ending all of his military commitments.

Today, the 30-year-old royal revealed that he will be taking part in an epic 1,000 mile trek through the UK as part of a fundraising drive for Walking With The Wounded.

Speaking during the launch of Walk of Britain at London's Mandarin Oriental Hotel, the prince said he was 'delighted' to be taking part in the trek and is 'looking forward to it'.

He also used his first public appearance since announcing he is leaving the Army to admit that he expects the transition into civilian life to be 'challenging'.

'The public’s support for our Armed Forces continues to be extraordinary,' he said. 'However, as the memory of our military commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan fade, we must encourage people to continue supporting our servicemen and women; particularly those who are seeking to transition into civilian life. 

'This process can be challenging, as it is for anyone seeking a new career. As I make this transition myself, I'm determined to do all I can to help others.'

Today's visit to the Mandarin Oriental comes just 48 hours after Kensington Palace announced that he is to retire from the Army after a 10-year career that included two tours of duty in Afghanistan.

Before he hangs up his boots, Harry will spend four weeks with the Australian Defence Force, splitting his time between Sydney, Darwin and Perth, and will continue on to New Zealand for an official tour.

Much of the summer will be spend in Africa, where the Prince will occupy himself with charity work, much of it conservation focused, according to Kensington Palace.

Returning to the UK in the autumn, Harry will then join the core team of five wounded veterans taking part in the Walk of Britain which gets underway on the 22nd August in Scotland.

The epic trek, which, it is hoped, will result in wider public awareness of veterans' needs, will end in London on the 31st October.

Harry is no stranger to the charity's lengthy expeditions, having previously taken part in walks to the North Pole in 2011 and another to the South Pole in 2013.

For the latter, the Prince was joined by a star-studded crew that included Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård, as well of wounded veterans - some of whom were at the Mandarin Oriental for the launch.

Watched by an audience that included Walking With the Wounded co-founder Ed Perkins, Harry made an impassioned speech about the need to help veterans and outlined his hopes for the trek.

'Walk of Britain will cover all parts of the country,' he explained. 'Walking through the communities in which our service personnel and veterans grew up and now live.

'In doing so, Walk of Britain will give everyone the opportunity to meet these remarkable men and women. 

Achievement: The five-strong team will walk 1,000 miles through the UK, starting at the end of August

Helping out: Harry's last trek with Walking with the Wounded took him to Antarctica

'People up and down the country will get to see first-hand the determination and resolve of those who have served, and in particular those who have been injured or suffer hidden wounds. 

'They will see that whatever their circumstances these men and women are looking to the future. They are looking to employers to give them the chance to keep making a contribution to our communities.

'These men and women want to continue to serve their country in whatever way possible. PTSD and mental injury can make life a daily struggle, but we should not assume that everyone leaving the military faces these challenges.

'It's also important to keep mental health issues in perspective. We should remind people that nearly all cases end well, whether it be total cure, adjustment of life, or the ability for the individual to accept and admit the issues that face them, amongst a tricky culture of stigma.

 Involved: Harry, pictured arriving at the Mandarin Oriental, has long championed wounded soldiers

 Projects: As well as Walking with the Wounded, he also spearheaded the Invictus Games

 Retirement: Harry will be seconded to the Australia Defence Force for a month before he leaves the Army

'It is a delicate balance between being ready to support those who need it and recognising the valuable role those who have served in the military can play in civilian life.'

Harry's work with Walking With the Wounded echoes his previous efforts, most notably last year's hugely successful Invictus Games.

Although the event will not take place this year, aides are keen to emphasise that Prince Harry's championing of wounded servicemen will continue post-retirement.

He will also continue to take part in military events, beginning with a trip to Turkey next month to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign next month.

The battle was one of the bloodiest of World War I and resulted in the deaths of approximately 43,000 British soldiers, 8,709 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders.

Harry, who will be based in Australia when the event takes place, will fly to Turkey and will be joined by Prince Charles for a memorial service.
