The Environment Agency has rubber-stamped the building of almost 200,000 homes on flood plains since it was formed, figures reveal.

The under-fire quango agreed to their construction despite concerns they may become uninsurable or that owners could face sky-high premiums.

Official statistics show that since the agency was created in 1996, up to 14,500 homes have been built every year on low-lying areas near rivers.

Most of the 190,000 homes built on low-lying land since 1996 were constructed without objection from the Environment Agency, despite the risk to homeowners

Councils are obliged by law to seek the approval of the Environment Agency if they are considering developments on flood plains. If the agency objects, the scheme usually does not go ahead.

It has been a stressful time for anyone affected by the floods.

But it seems the task of dealing with the political fallout may also be taking its toll on David Cameron’s hair.

The Prime Minister was looking distinctly greyer as he unveiled £10million in aid for flood-hit businesses during a visit to Worcestershire and Gloucestershire yesterday.

He also vowed to build more flood defences and said a rethink was needed over dredging.

The official figures, which emerged in response to a parliamentary question from Labour MP Chris Ruane, show that an estimated 190,000 homes were built on flood plains since 1996. Most will have been built without the Environment Agency raising an objection.

In many cases, however, it will have just advised the council on how to ensure the properties are as flood resistant as possible.

The figures also reveal that, despite Labour’s criticisms of the Government’s handling of the floods crisis, more homes were built in high risk areas under the party than since.

Between 1997 and 2010, there were 171,700 new homes constructed on flood-risk areas, with a peak of 14,500 in 2006.

The annual totals have decreased since the last election, down to just 7,900 in 2011. Planning minister Nick Boles said the number was now ‘at its lowest rate since records began’.

He added: ‘The figure will never be zero, as this would mean there would be a complete ban on any form of development in many existing towns and cities which happen to be flood-risk areas.’

Instead, new buildings in high risk areas must be ‘appropriately flood resistant and resilient’, he said.

The figures emerged as the agency yesterday warned that parts of southern England including Kent, Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset could remain under water for ‘weeks if not months’.

Although respite from extreme weather is expected, experts said many homes are not yet ‘out of the woods’.

As the relief effort continued in the Somerset Levels, it was revealed yesterday that offenders have been helping to fill sandbags.

Probation Service officials supervised seven convicted criminals as they used 14 tonnes of sand to fill 600 bags on Saturday. A group of five filled 750 bags the day after.

Meanwhile, David Cameron has pledged to go to every flood-hit area of the country to ‘try to learn lessons’ after a visit to Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire.

Between 1997 and 2010, there were 171,700 new homes constructed on flood-risk areas, with a peak of 14,500 in 2006

Insurance companies will also be called to Downing Street today to discuss the extra help they can give flood-affected households.

The bosses of firms including Aviva, Direct Line and Lloyds will meet floods minister Dan Rogerson and Cabinet Office ministers Oliver Letwin and Jo Johnson.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ‘The insurance sector should be doing as much as they can to support people in terms of proactively going out and contacting individuals who may be affected, and offering the speediest assistance in terms of making claims.’

The Association of British Insurers last night said flood victims have so far received £14 million in emergency payments – typically between £500 and £3,000 each. Some £2 million has been paid out for emergency accommodation.

An ITV poll showed that almost two thirds of Britons think the Government is emerging from the floods crisis with a worse reputation for climate management.
