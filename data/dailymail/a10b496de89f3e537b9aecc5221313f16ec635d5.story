Police say a man accused of killing his mother and sister in their North Las Vegas home started dismembering one of the bodies and tried to clean up the bloody scene.

Detectives think Darius Davon Sorrells, 30, lived for several days at the house with the two corpses before he was arrested by chance after a weekend traffic chase, Police Sgt. Chrissie Coon said on Tuesday.

He was named as a suspect on Tuesday by authorities.

Sorrells' 53-year-old mother and 33-year-old sister have been missing since last week.

The Clark County coroner opened two homicide cases, but didn't immediately release the identity of the bodies removed Monday from the home.

However, the owner of the 6120 Stibor Street home is listed in county records as Natasha Sorrells, 8 News Now reports. Neighbor Kelly Bacon told the channel that Sorrells and her adult daughter lived in the house.

'They were very quiet, very secluded, didn't say or do much,' Bacon told Fox5Vegas. She also said she saw a younger man walk to house frequently.

'I mean he would sometimes sit in the driveway just waiting for someone to come home I guess,' she said.

Police went to the home at about 2:30 a.m. Monday to check on the two women, after they were reported missing by family members and friends on Friday. Officers entered through an unlocked back door and found a gruesome crime scene, Coon said.

The slayings came to light Monday after 
police stretched yellow crime scene tape around the neighborhood and 
spent more than 14 hours gathering evidence.

Investigators collected evidence and tools that could have been used in the slaying and dismemberment, Coon said.

Coroner's investigators even went to the house more than once to retrieve human remains, she said.

Coon declined to say where in the home the bodies were found or specify the type of tools involved.

'We don't know yet how they died and which wounds were inflicted post-mortem,' she said. 'It's not exactly clear what the murder weapon was. A lot is going to depend on the results of the autopsies.'

Sorrells was already in jail â€” having been found early Saturday by patrol officers looking for a 2004 GMC Envoy being driven erratically in an area a couple of miles from the home.

When police approached the vehicle in a shopping center parking lot about 3 a.m., it sped away and at one point drove into oncoming traffic lanes before crashing into a light pole, Coon said.

Sorrells fled on foot from the SUV toward nearby railroad tracks before he was caught.

'It was unclear at the time why he ran from police,' Coon said.

She said Sorrells was booked on 11 misdemeanor charges, including suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs, obstructing a police officer and driving without a license and insurance.

He was being held Tuesday at the Las Vegas City Jail pending an initial court appearance on murder charges in the slaying, as well as the traffic offenses, Coon said. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney.
