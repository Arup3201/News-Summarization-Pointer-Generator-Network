A woman has been evicted from a trailer park after hundreds of pet rats were found inside her mobile home.

Darlene Flatoff ‘s trailer in Plover, Wisconsin, was found to be infested with rat faeces and the rodents had chewed their way through walls and floorboards.

Authorities were shocked of the state of the trailer and exterminator Matthew Schnider said it was the worst case he had seen in his entire career.

Gift that keeps on giving: Darlene Flatoff was given her first pet rat as a present, ending up with 300 as they reproduced, of which a few dozen remain after her eviction

Meanwhile Ms Flatoff said the rats were her friend sand didn’t cause any harm, WAOW.com reported.

Ms Flatoff’s around 300 ‘friends’ began as a single pet rat gifted to her, and it is believed that the rats simply multiplied the natural way, taking over the trailer.

'They've chewed out the floor boards,’ Mr Schneider told adding that he has never seen anything like it in this 20 years as an exterminator

‘When you get to this amount of infestation, they're going to do a ton of damage’
