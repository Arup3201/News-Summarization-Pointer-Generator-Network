Stylist to the stars Clare Harries narrowly avoided a prison sentence after admitting twice driving while four times the drink-drive limit

A stylist to the stars  crashed her car while nearly four times the drink-drive limit twice in the same week.

Clare Harries, 50, of Tufnell Park, north London, was told she 'could have killed someone' by a judge today, who described the case as one of the worst he had ever seen.

The Chelsea School of Art graduate has worked with a celebrity clientele which includes stars Bruce Willis, Daniel Radcliffe, Jude Law, Angelina Jolie and Emma Watson.

But she was sentenced to four months imprisonment, suspended for two years, today and disqualified from driving for five years.

Hammersmith Magistrates Court District Judge Paul Goldspring said: 'Someone who is this many times over the legal limit is just about as dangerous as anybody on the road. I can't think of a case that ticks as many aggravating boxes.'

Described as 'one of the most respected and experienced stylists working in the industry today' Harries specialises in film and TV shoots; photo shoots, award ceremonies, including the Oscars, and is also a style consultant and interior designer.

The mother-of-two pleaded guilty to driving her blue Mercedes in Oxford Street on October 15 with 133 microgrammes of alcohol to every 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35.

She also admitted driving in Wood Green, north London on October 20 with 141 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.

Simon Sherriff, defending, said: 'She is on the surface a woman, who two years ago, was apparently a busy working single-mother. That was a social facade and hidden from virtually everybody, under the ice, there was a slow decline of physical and mental health.'

The court heard Harries was involved in a collision in Orchard Street in the West End before driving off and being pulled over in Oxford Street in the first incident.

She was then invlved in a second incident, in which she hit a parked car in Hornsey, north London and pulled over in nearby Wood Green after again driving off.

When police caught up with her the car was stationary with the engine running, the lights on the front tyre was flat and Harries was gripping the steering wheel and staring blankly ahead.

In 2013, Harries - who a son aged fifteen and a daughter aged seventeen - was convicted of being in charge of a vehicle while over the alcohol limit and was fined and given ten penalty points.

Mr Sherriff told the court: 'One of her friends tells me you would not believe this is the same woman as two years ago.

'The marriage to her first husband was an unhealthy relationship that led to divorce and after the collapse of her marriage to her second husband she lost the family home in March and is in rented accommodation, which she hopes to get out of.

'Social services will take over if there is an immediate custodial sentence and the house she is renting for the children will go.

'There would be a long-term detrimental effect on the children if she goes to prison and they will lose their accommodation. In this case that would be the punishment of the innocent.'

He added: 'On the first occasion the officers state she was in a confused state. She is on this medication and it effected her capacity.

'The surgery a month before seems the most likely trigger to these offences. The hair that broke the donkey's back.'

District Judge Goldspring told a tearful Harries: 'There is an issue regarding your thought process around vehicles when you have had alcohol.

'If you get into a car this much over the limit that car becomes a lethal weapon and to compound it there was a road traffic accident. You could have killed someone.

'Within five days you were back in the car over the limit and placed yourself and other road users in great peril. These readings are up there with the highest this court has ever heard of.

'It's a difficult case to sentence. The easiest thing in the world would be to send you to prison, but I have considered carefully the effect your behaviour has had on the children.

'The loss of their mother to custody and then being taken into care would be devastating and they are at an age where they may never recover from it.'
