With their giant fangs and deadly bite, most of us wouldn't choose to step foot near a venomous snake, let alone go looking for one.

But hunting and capturing venomous snakes is all in a day's work for America's Rattlesnake Wranglers.

The fearless wranglers track, chase and capture the deadly snakes using a metal snake hook or sometimes just their bare hands.

Fearless: Hunting and capturing venomous snakes is all in a day's work for America's Rattlesnake Wranglers

These images taken by photographer Joel Sartore show the infamous wranglers showcasing their talents at the annual Mangum Rattlesnake Derby in Oklahoma, US.

The event held by the The Shortgrass Rattlesnake Association aims to educate the public about rattlesnakes from the dangers they pose to the their beneficial role in the environment.

Joel took the image as part of a photographic assignment for National Geographic Magazine.

He said: 'I went there as part of a story on animal migrations in North America, though we don't often think of snakes as migrating, they do indeed.

There are dozens of species of rattlesnakes across the US, and they are the largest among venomous snakes.

They usually only sound their noisy rattles if they feel cornered, threatened or taken by surprise.

Rattlesnake bites are usually not fatal, as long as they are treated quickly, but deaths have occurred.

If bitten, victims are advised to remain calm, as a quickened heart rate can spread the venom throughout the body faster.

Rattlesnakes
love to sun themselves, and can be found near logs, boulders, or open 
areas, and in areas like mountains, prairies, deserts, and beaches.

'In winter they gather in large numbers in dens. That's where the hunters will often find them.

'A wrangler's job is not without risk, yet these guys are good at it.

'It is possible for wranglers to be killed by snakes, I think the danger aspect is the attraction and the reason so many folks come from far and wide to the event.

'But the wranglers are careful and 
very few have been bitten over the years.'

He told how he visited one who had been 
bitten in the lower leg while working in the snake pit.

'He'd
been wearing tennis shoes instead of cowboy boots and one had bitten 
him just above the ankle,' he said.

'His leg had turned black and he was in the 
hospital. He eventually made a full recovery.'

He said despite the hard work of the wranglers in the town, the number of snake sightings keep on rising.

And as the largest of the venomous snakes, they are not hard to spot.

'The
wranglers are doing what they need to do in order to keep their town 
running, and they say that the numbers of snakes at the dens isn't 
decreasing,' Joel added.

'Environmentalists, on the other hand,
will say that rattlesnakes take a long time to reach sexual maturity 
and so snake hunting really knocks their numbers down

'My
job is not to share my feelings on the subjects I cover, but instead 
tell stories and let the readers think about it a little and make their 
own minds up.'

Rattlesnake bites are usually not fatal, as long as they are treated quickly, but deaths have occurred.

A Pentecostal reverend known for 
preaching with the help of a rattlesnake coiled around his arm lost his 
life when one of the creatures suddenly bit him.

Mack
Randall Wolford, pastor at the Full Gospel Apostolic House of the Lord 
Jesus in Matoaka, West Virginia, died hours after receiving the deadly 
bite on Sunday - the day after his 44th birthday.

Wolfordâ€™s father, who was also a serpent-handling pastor, died in the same way nearly 30 years ago.

In California, the problem has become so widespread that scientists dispatched a legion of robot squirrels into the wilds to battle against rattlesnakes.

The
robo-rodents will bravely endure the bites of the poisonous reptiles to
help scientists unravel a mystery - why squirrels heat up their tails 
when confronted with one of the deadly predators.

The
lab which has created the robots has already cut its teeth with a 
camera-equipped robot grouse which spied on grouse mating rituals, and a
robot lizard which explored the jungle in Puerto Rico.
