Orlando Cruz is after a world boxing title tonight but his bout in the ring is nothing compared to the battle for acceptance the gay boxer has been fighting for years.

For 12 years the Olympic sportsman hid his sexuality, fearing the reaction of the macho boxing world, but the featherweight champion is now out, proud - and wearing the rainbow shorts to prove it.

Being comfortable with who he is has been a struggle for Cruz, who first realized he was gay after competing for Puerto Rico in the 2000 Olympics.

'I was not happy with my life. I would feel a lot of pressure, and inside, I felt weighed down. I cried at night hoping the pain would go away,' he told CSN.

He eventually told his parents he was gay but, although his mother accepted him his father became distant. 

As the 126lb boxer's career began to turn professional, suspicions about his sexuality circulated. He recalled how a crowd turned hostile and verbally abused him in 2008, and said he denied he was gay to his own promoter, Oscar De La Hoya.

'[Oscar]
once asked me quite openly before a fight, "Orlando, tell me, are you 
going to tell people that you are gay?’",' Cruz said. 

'There were other 
people standing around us, too. Boxers. Managers. I was shocked and 
said, "No, I'm a man".'

Cruz could only hide for so long and, with the help of a therapist and his new promoter Tuto Zabala, the 32-year-old finally had the courage to tell the world he was gay in October last year.

Settled: Cruz with his boyfriend José Manuel who he is due to marry later in the year

Acceptance: The boxer, who is 'out and proud', wears rainbow shorts when he fights

'I feel liberated. I feel free,' Cruz, who is due to marry his boyfriend José Manuel in New 
York later this year said.  'I [came out] so I can also be a better boxer. Now I have 
respect in the streets and the ring.'

The couple would also like to adopt children from Puerto Rico, although the country currently doesn't allow same-sex marriages or adoptions.

Coming out has brought worldwide support for Cruz, who was inducted into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame over the summer.

And, as he tries to make history by becoming the first openly gay man to win a world title, Cruz will pay homage to his sexuality by wearing rainbow shorts in a nod to the LGBT community.

He has also dedicated the fight to the memory of former world champion Emile Griffith, who died aged 75 in July, and waited decades after retiring before he admitted he was bisexual.

For all Cruz's fears of being rejected by fellow boxers and fans, Orlando Salido, the man he will face in the ring tonight has also been supportive.

Prepared: Cruz is ready for the fight of his life as he goes after a world title

'I admire him for what he’s done,' Salido said. 'At the end of the day, we’re just two 
human beings fighting for a world title.'

The fight is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Cruz, however, who is determined to win.

'It's the most important fight of my life. I'm a gay man, but I'm also a boxer,' he told the Guardian.

'My two worlds have come together and I will fight with all my heart. The world knows the truth about me as a man. Now the world will see the truth about me as a fighter. I'm ready. This is my time.'
