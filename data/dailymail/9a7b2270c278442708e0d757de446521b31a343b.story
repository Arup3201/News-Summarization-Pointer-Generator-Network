Arsenal have been boosted by the return to full training of Mathieu Debuchy and Wojciech Szczesny.

But Arsene Wenger - who confirmed his interest in Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings - is sweating on the fitness of Kieran Gibbs and Laurent Koscielny ahead of Saturday's clash against Stoke.

Theo Walcott, Tomas Rosicky (thigh), Yaya Sanogo (calf) and Nacho Monreal (ankle) have been ruled out through injury. 

Kieran Gibbs, in action against West Brom last weekend, could miss Arsenal's trip to Stoke on Saturday

Walcott will have an injection on Friday in hope of clearing up a groin problem that has dogged him since the international break.

'We have to assess a few players today because we had some bad surprises with Nacho Monreal being out for tomorrow’s game,' revealed Wenger.

'Hopefully Kieran Gibbs will be available and back in the team and we have to assess some other players like Laurent Koscielny and a few bumps and bruises that we got after the game on Wednesday. I’ll make that decision after training today.

'I would like to play Koscielny because he is a very important player in our squad, and ideally I hope he will be available tomorrow. That decision will only be made tomorrow morning. Koscielny is an inflammation of his achilles, the problem is that when he plays, the inflammation comes back.

'We might also lose Tomas Rosicky with a thigh problem and Yaya Sanogo with a calf problem. Szczesny will be back today in full training. I don’t know if he will be completely available or not yet. Debuchy is also back in training but it’s too early for him.

'The earliest he could be available is maybe on Tuesday against Galatasaray. I don’t know whether I will take him yet because we are short number wise.'

On Walcott, Wenger added: 'He is still struggling with his groin inflammation. I think he has an injection today to take care of that.

'Hopefully he can be available again after that. Galatasaray will be too early for him.'

Meanwhile, Wenger confirmed Arsenal's interest in Ipswich starlet Mings.

Sportsmail revealed yesterday that the Gunners will launch a bid to sign the 21-year-old next month, and have been quoted a price of £10million.

And Wenger said: 'We are on a few young players yes, that we always follow. He is one of the players we follow, but we are not close to signing anybody at the moment.'
