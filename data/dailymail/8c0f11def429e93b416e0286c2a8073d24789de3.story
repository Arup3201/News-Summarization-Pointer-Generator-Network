Electricity officials in heatwave-hit Texas have warned of impending rolling blackouts from power shortages as the U.S. state struggles to cope with the relentless scorching temperatures.

Texans have turned to air conditioners in huge numbers in a bid to beat one of the hottest summers on record in America's second most populous state.

But bosses for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) say the soaring power demand in the face of the brutal heatwave has left the state one power plant shut-down away from rolling blackouts.

Temperatures in Texas are currently topping 100F (37.8C) and have been soaring for well over a month.

Record highs have also been recorded this week in nearby states Oklahoma and Arkansas as the relentless heatwave spreads across southern America.

In Forth Smith and Little Rock, Arkansas, the mercury hit 115F on Wednesday.

ERCOT, which runs the power grid for most of Texas, cut power to some large industrial users after electricity demand hit three consecutive records this week alone.

The grid operator now faces rolling blackouts similar to those which hit Texas during a bitter cold snap in February.

In Dallas, Texas, a pensioner died from 'heat-related' causes after her air conditioning unit was stolen from her house.

Delores Grissom, 79, had the unit stolen from her front yard last month and died two days later after telling neighbours, 'I'm getting so hot'.

Although the electricity firm have done their best to regulate power use and prevent shortages, experts admitted a further shut-down is a possibility.

Arshad Mansoor, senior vice president at the Electric Power Research Institute, said: 'You always have to expect the unexpected can happen.'A unit can shut. The wind may not blow.'

Ice storms in February crippled dozens of power plants, forcing ERCOT to impose rolling blackouts for hours as electric power demand outstripped supply.

Power usage in ERCOT reached its highest level ever on Wednesday at 68,294 megawatts, almost four per cent over last year's peak.

The Texas grid faces at least one more day of extreme stress before temperatures cool slightly over the weekend.

Temperatures in Houston, the state's biggest city, should return to near normal levels in the upper 90s over the weekend, according to AccuWeather.com.

The state's biggest power generators, including units of Energy Future Holdings, NRG Energy, Calpine Corp and others, have been running flat out to cash in real-time prices that have hit the $3,000/MWh cap in recent days.

But the state's reserve margins have been running razor thin. On Wednesday ERCOT came within 50 megawatts of interrupting flows to industrial customers.

One megawatt powers about 200 homes in Texas during hot weather when air conditioners are running for long periods.

Extreme drought: Tropical Storm Don didn't offer any respite to areas like Manor, Texas. By the time it made landfall, Don had been downgraded to a tropical depression

Kent Saathoff, ERCOT's vice president of system planning and operations, said more generation supplies would help, but added that state power generators cannot be expected to prepare for every extreme in weather.

He said: 'You have to determine if it is worth spending millions or billions to avoid a one in 10-year event.'

With record-breaking demand came 
record-breaking prices. Prices for Thursday power topped $400 per 
megawatt hour, the highest in at least a decade. Friday's power prices 
approached $600.

Real-time prices also hit the $3,000 market cap over the past few days.
ERCOT has about 73,000 MW of natural 
gas, coal, oil, nuclear and wind generating facilities, but not all of 
that capacity is available all the time.

Texas has the most wind power in the 
country, but the wind does not blow during the summer. Ercot said it got
about 2,000 MW from wind during the peak hour on Wednesday.
