Would you pay £1.3m to be kidnapped in front of your colleagues, trained in weaponry by ex-SAS soldiers, and take part in a covert operation across several countries?

Individuals with money to burn are getting to live out their secret-agent fantasies in the ultimate travel experience.

Special Operations Agency is a team of ex-SAS, SBS and SIS members who have joined forces to provide unprecedented access to Special-Forces and Secret-Service training.

Be like Bond: A new experience offers unprecedented access to Special-Forces and Secret-Service training

Secret mission: Participants are flown to secret locations to be trained in weaponry and combat

It is the first company to offer civilians the chance to be trained for and complete covert missions, which take place across eastern Europe and America.

Depending on the operation, clients can experience thrilling helicopter rides, combat situations, dealing with explosives and hostage rescue. 

The sky is the limit for the most extravagant package offered by the company - called Operation Connery. Costing £165,000 per head for a minimum of eight people, it will take you on a four-day mission across Europe.

Secret agent style: You'll complete search and rescue missions and have shoot-outs with bad guys

Past participants have experienced a boat chase from Nice to Monaco, where they received a briefing from an M-style character and a glamorous evening at the casino.

Over the next few days, they arrive in the Czech Republic by helicopter and jet into the Swiss mountains. 

They jump out of cars and experience choreographed shoot-outs with the bad guys, all in a bid to get their imaginary '007-status'.

Mission complete: At the end, guests are rewarded with a lavish Bond-style party

Special Operations Agency MD Sean Crawford tells MailOnline Travel that the missions transforms grown men and women into children again. 'It's an adrenaline ride,' he says. 'The ultimate high.'

One high net-worth client from Russia paid £2m to arrange for members of their staff - some unaware it was not real - to be taken on a cat and mouse chase across America.

The Special Operations Agency filtered faux threats to the company, kidnapped one employee, and trained the team in a search and rescue mission that ended in a lavish Bond-style party.

Safety first: Thorough briefing and training will prepare guests for any scenario

Not just for the boys: Company MD Sean Crawford reveals that women tend to be the best shots

The cherry on top of an already astounding experience is delivery of 'the ultimate goodie bag' by Union Jack parachute. 

It's not just for the boys, in fact, Crawford reveals that in his experience, 'women tend to be the best shots'. 

And it's also not just for the mega-wealthy. Realising that there is a market for a secret-agent experiences with a more modest budget, the Agency has introduced a range of 'operations' that cost just under £3,000. 

Taking place in European sites near Prague and Vienna, the two-day packages will offer guests the chance to experience weaponry training and combat scenarios - and they don't sacrifice the glamorous after-party. 

Operations retain an air of mystery, so participants don't know exactly what they can expect before embarking on missions.

Extravagant: The most expensive mission, Operation Connery, costs upwards of £165,000 a head

'Ultimate high': The idea came when Crawford witnessed participants in firearms training 'buzzing like kids'

The idea came about several years ago when Crawford was instructing at a firearms school in Hereford, while his partner, Carl Leonard, was training Daniel Craig in pistols on the set of Casino Royale.

'I watched students buzzing like little kids,' Crawford says. They realised there was a market for secret agent-style courses.

It took several years for the idea to be realised; the recession putting plans on hold.The high-rolling City boys and their toys who were their target market tamed their spending habits, but the past year has seen demand for extravagant experiences skyrocket again. 

Don't expect free reign with a rifle though - safety is paramount, and Crawford stresses that every combat situation is strictly choreographed. 'Nobody actually moves with a loaded weapon,' he insists.
