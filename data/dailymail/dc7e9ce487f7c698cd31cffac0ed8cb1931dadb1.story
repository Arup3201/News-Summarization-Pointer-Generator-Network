The £15 billion Crossrail project reached another landmark today when a tunnel boring machine broke through into an east London station.

The breakthrough into the huge underground space at Whitechapel by the machine named Victoria marked the completion of 75 per cent of the tunnelling work on the scheme, which will be finished in 2018. Work is taking place more than 100ft down to create a new platform and passenger tunnels for a new Crossrail station.

More than 19 miles of tunnelling have now been completed, with more than 2.5 million tonnes of earth removed and three of the eight boring machines having 'retired'. Running from Reading in Berkshire in the west to as far east as Shenfield in Essex, Crossrail will pass through 40 stations and reduce cross-London journey times.

Rail Minister Stephen Hammond said today: 'Crossrail is set to transform rail travel across south east England, improving journeys for thousands of passengers and securing long-term economic benefits across the region and beyond.'

London mayor Boris Johnson said: 'We're tantalisingly close to finishing what is without doubt a monumental feat of engineering. It's quite remarkable what the Crossrail team has achieved so far and we now look forward to the next exciting stage of the project - the fitting-out of the Crossrail stations of the future.'

Workers arrive to watch as a tunelling machine breaks through into the station which forms part of the network.The 150 metre long boring machine broke through this morning marking the three quarters completion point on the project which will consist of 19 miles of tunnel

On track: More workers turn up as the landmark is reached. Only a quarter of the project is left to finish and looks set to open in 2018

Watchful: Crossrail engineers keep an eye on the progress of the 1,000-tonne tunneling machine, Victoria, as it breaks into the underground station at Whitechape

Hole: Workers wait in a tunnel after a Crossrail boring machine broke through into the Whitechapel station which forms part of the Crossrail network. Passenger walkways and tunnel are currently being developed in stations across London
